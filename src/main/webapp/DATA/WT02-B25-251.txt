<H2>Just Between Us</H2>
In this column, I'm going to tell you a story full of unnecessary suffering and grief.  It's been a nightmare to remember and to write about.
<P>
The problem is words. Incredible power is compressed into words. Too many words and notions applied to consumers are poisoned by prejudice.  Stigma insinuates such subtly degrading lies and masquerades in such seductively simple half-truths.
<P>
Wherever the truth about mental illness is more complex than the words regularly used to describe it, that's where consumers suffer helplessly and too often needlessly.  The suffering is because no one sees accurately what's really happening to us or is willing to work with us to stop the tragedies before they happen.  
<P>
The heart of my story is a friend, a friend from the knob country of the rural South, quiet, honest, hard-working, and for parts of his life caught in the iron grip of unreasoning terror.
<P>
He could be painfully shy, withdrawn.  Even those who loved him aren't sure just when he slipped silently into paranoia.  He never graduated from school.  He was too ill.  
<P>
In the grip of driving terror he believed he'd be killed if he didn't defend himself.  He lashed out in explosive violence and killed.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was remanded to a forensics facility where he was treated successfully and released.
<P>
I met him on the bus.  He was lost.  It was a bitter winter and he was wearing a short-sleeved cotton shirt.  Miraculously, he let me give him my sweatshirt and welcomed me as friend. 
<P>
We met more on the phone than in person.  We saw each other regularly on the bus to the local mental health center.  The second time I saw him he told me his story.  He astounded me by his halting openness, his absolute honesty.  Simply, with no evasions, no excuses, he told his tale.  To share that took incredible courage.
<P>
Over time it was clear:  his meds just weren't working as well as they once had.  He was slipping away.  I asked if he'd told his therapist.  He had.  He did again.  He hoped to see a psychiatrist about a meds change.  The available appointment was just too far in the future.  His life was getting scary.
<P>
We urged him to visit emergency intake so he could perhaps access a psychiatrist without the endless wait.  Or, we thought, he'd end up admitted to our local state hospital where he'd been before.
<P>
The mental health center where he went for treatment relies more on counseling than on state-of-the-art meds work.  Come the annual budget crunch, the director is famous among consumers for cutting psychiatry hours rather than talk therapy.  Again my friend tried to schedule a meds visit, but all he could get was another therapy appointment in a few days.  He was deteriorating, becoming volatile and agitated.
<P>
A neighbor, concerned and frightened, took him the next morning to emergency intake.  All he got was words. 
<P>
Later, a family down the street found him wandering, disoriented, and called the police.  The police talked to the neighbor who'd taken him to the center that morning, then took him back to emergency intake.  The person who saw him apparently didn't assess the acuity of the situation, even though my friend's complete records were at the center, and they included details of the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity verdict.
<P>
Late that evening, after he left the center, the police arrested him for the death of his neighbor, the very person who had taken him to the center in the morning looking for help and care.
<P>
Headlines shrieked, "Mentally Ill Killer Let Loose in Suburban Neighborhood," "Psychotic Killer Strikes Again."
<P>
We saw him in jail awaiting trial.  He wasn't on medication.  He talked word salad.  He was clearly psychotic.
<P>
A mental health professional characterized my friend to the press as a treatment-resistant, uncooperative case.  No one questioned that description or the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the treatment he actually received from that mental health center.
<P>
He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.  He has yet to receive effective medication or appropriate treatment, and he is too ill to avoid the predators inside the bars.
<P>
Our extremely conservative governor mentioned him as a killer who would be kept off our streets by the Republican initiative to build 27 new prisons.  The governor wants to "privatize," or sell, our state mental hospitals to pay for the 27 new prisons.  
<P>
What has this to do with words?  I'm desperate to know, Was all this suffering inevitable because my friend was treatment-resistant and uncooperative?  Or did the treatment system catastrophically fail my friend, his neighbor, and our community?  What about the right to timely, humane, effective care?
