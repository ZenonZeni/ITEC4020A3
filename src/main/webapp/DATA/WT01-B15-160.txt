<pre>NEWS MEDIA CONTACT:                                     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Joanne L. Johnson, 202/586-5806                         June 12, 1996</pre>
<p>
     A <A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/intro/planltr.htm">draft Program Plan</A> for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management (OCRWM) is being released today. This revised Program Plan has been
prepared to implement the administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request and the direction of
Congress in the Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriation's legislation. The Department of Energy
recognizes that the plan is based on assumptions that may have to be updated and modified, as
appropriate.
<p>
     The plan is consistent with the administration's position on high-level radioactive waste
management, in that geologic disposal remains the basic goal. The administration strongly
believes that the siting of any interim storage facility must be based upon objective criteria and
that such a decision should be informed by the scientific work necessary to determine the
viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. Prior to the completion of that work the
activities in the plan related to interim storage are limited to non-site specific design and
engineering and the preparation for transportation.
<p>
     Improvements in integration and efficiency have enabled the program to adapt to a sharp
reduction of program funding while preserving the core scientific programs at Yucca Mountain
and to develop and propose a course of action that has the potential to regain the objective of
repository licensing within a reasonable time frame.
<p>
     Since the <em>1994 Program Plan</em> was initiated, a great deal of progress has been made in the
scientific evaluation and understanding of the specific attributes of the Yucca Mountain site.
Since 1993, the project has excavated over three-and-a-half miles of tunnel and four testing
alcoves; drilled seven deep and 19 shallow boreholes; and excavated 13 trenches for geologic
investigations. Analysis of the data collected over the past 20 years, and in particular the last
several years, has confirmed many of the hypotheses that will be relied upon for a site suitability
determination and a license application for the repository.
<p>
     Key elements of the new program direction for the Yucca Mountain Project include:
<p><ul>
<li><em> Updating the regulatory framework for a repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997 -- </em>the
     program will propose amendments to the Department of Energy's siting guidelines that
     will lead to a more efficient process for suitability determination.
<p>
<li>     <em>Completing the viability assessment of the Yucca Mountain Repository Site in 1998 --</em> the
     program will address the major unresolved technical questions so that an informed
     assessment can be made of the viability of licensing and constructing a geologic
     repository at Yucca Mountain. The assessment will include critical repository design
     elements, a total system performance assessment, a plan and cost estimate for remaining
     work required for a license application, and a cost estimate to construct and operate the
     repository.
<p>
 <li>    <em>Recommending a repository site to the President in 2001 and submitting a repository
     license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002-- </em>the program's
     strategy is to concentrate on the factors significant to the performance of a repository at
     Yucca Mountain. After completion of the viability assessment, the program will prepare
     the additional information necessary for the Secretary of Energy's site recommendation to
     the President and license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>
     OCRWM will also focus some resources on activities designed to ensure that waste
acceptance can begin as soon as policy and technical developments allow. A waste acceptance
and transportation strategy is being developed that will rely on private sector implementation. An
acquisition strategy for equipment and services will be developed and industry and vendor views
solicited.
