<B>MNR Sets New Burning Guidelines


</B>

</CENTER><P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources has developed simpler rules for the use of fire that remove the need for people to get a fire permit for small fires within new guidelines.  These guidelines apply to the province's fire regions.
<P>
"We have developed simpler guidelines that clearly outline the types of fires people can set without a permit.  These guidelines apply to lighting a fire for purposes other than cooking or warmth and require the person to keep the fire small and under control at all times," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>
 
The new guidelines result from changes to the Forest Fires Prevention Act.  Under these changes, people no longer require a permit for burning grass, leaves, or woody debris, provided the fires fall within the guidelines. People are not allowed to start a small fire during the day, since that's the time of greatest fire risk.  All small fires must now be started no sooner than two hours before sunset, and must be extinguished two hours after sunrise or earlier.  Specific conditions about the size of a fire also apply.  In all cases, a responsible person must attend the fire until it is out, and adequate tools and water to contain the fire must be kept on hand. <P>

"The new guidelines about safe burning times are a significant change from the past since they allow a person to set a small fire without a permit as long as the rules are strictly followed," said Mr. Hodgson.  
"During forest fire season, and when weather conditions are extreme, MNR will still reserve the right to ban all fires."<P>

Anyone wishing to start a small fire under the new guidelines must remember that he or she is fully responsible for that fire.  People must keep the fire under control and comply with the Forest Fires Prevention Act.  Measures under the Act related to safe burning, such as warnings, fines and, or charges, will continue to be in place.<P>

The conditions and specifications for incinerators are still in force, but permits are not required.  However, permits will still be required for any large-scale, open burning.<P>

"The Forest Fires Prevention Act applies within the province's fire regions, including municipalities located within those regions," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The only exception would be if a municipality has a bylaw regulating burning and requires a permit.  In this instance, the bylaw would take precedence."<P>

For more information on municipal bylaws, the public should contact their nearest municipal fire department.  Information on the province's fire regions and the new guidelines is available at MNR District and Area offices.<P>
