As we approach the close of 1996, it's remarkable how eventful the year has been and yet, economically, we are essentially where we were one year ago. 
<P>
The fundamentals of the economy are remarkably similar today to what they were in 1995. Long-term interest rates are approximately 6.5% compared to 6.3% in November 1995. The economy is growing at a rate of approximately 2.2%. Inflation continues to be well under control, at about 3.0%.  
<P>
One significant difference between today and one year ago is that stock prices are on average up 20%. While price movements were more volatile in 1996 than in the past few years, the patient investor was amply rewarded. The prime element sending the stock market higher was strong positive cash flows. Such liquidity in an environment of modestly increasing corporate profits and relatively stable interest rates pushed stocks higher for most of the year. 
<P>
This higher stock market has caused many market observers to worry. While we cannot ignore what has happened, we find no reason to be bearish over the long term. The environment is benign to favorable for financial assets. Given steady interest rates, moderate economic growth and continued moderate corporate earnings growth, there are few excesses in the system.  In fact, real interest rates are probably too high considering our outlook for inflation, and we may see them decline over time.
<P>
Naturally, we cannot rule out the possibility of a market correction. But, in our belief, the downside would appear to be limited to 5% to 8%, which is the size of a typical correction based on historical data. As we have said in previous outlooks, three elements tend to move the market:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE> 
<LI><B>Earnings.</B> We forecast corporate earnings to range between 0% and 5% on average for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500* in 1997 -- not as high as in recent previous years but positive nonetheless.
<P>
<LI><B>Interest rates.</B> Rates should remain stable, and short-term interest rates may even decline.
<P>
<LI><B>Liquidity.</B> Investors, through mutual funds, 401(k)s and qualified contribution plans in particular, will continue to create strong demand for securities.
</UL>
<P>
In order to move the market more than would be expected in a typical decline, one or more of these elements will have to turn negative in 1997, and, while future conditions cannot be predicted with certainty, we fail to see what would materially change our outlook. Our outlook going forward is that 1997 should be a lot like 1996.
<P>
While the economy continued along a relatively consistent path, the United States took some politically significant steps in 1996. First, of course, President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress were re-elected by the voters. In the first few days after the general election, especially, investors demonstrated their support for such a balance in our leadership. But of much greater long-term significance is the expressed commitment by both parties to balance the federal budget and address certain entitlement programs. The first year after an election can be a fertile time to accomplish major initiatives, and we are hopeful that progress can be made.
<P>
The future of the Social Security system, which many experts believe will run out of money about 20 years from now, will be a subject in which you can expect Zurich Kemper Investments to play a leadership role. The possible solutions for "fixing Social Security" are finite: raise Social Security taxes, reduce benefits, raise the retirement age, change inflation assumptions or pursue a higher rate of return on assets contributed by workers. We believe that a bipartisan solution will be worked out, which will include giving individuals the option of investing a portion of their Social Security contributions in an account earmarked for them. This change is needed to return credibility to the system, which many Americans have lost faith in. What to do with Social Security is a debate that spans generations and promises to occupy much attention in the coming years. As we hope to help advance constructive debate, we'll be advocating partial privatization for this federal program while maintaining a safety net for many low-wage earners and providing a seamless transition for seniors near or in retirement.
