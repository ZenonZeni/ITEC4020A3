anytime from grade school to graduate school. But for a career in the

Mathematics provides the basis for all the sciences, even

<FONT SIZE="+2"><B><I>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>
Roger Daley received a bachelors degree in physics, but decided to
become a weatherman. "I wanted to do something practical with my
education, something that would help people in ordinary life," says
Daley. The physics of weather seemed more practical to him than
nuclear physics, for instance. Canada educates weathermen for free, but
afterwards you "pay it back" by going where ever they send you. Roger
was posted to the remote Goose Bay weather station in Labrador
(actually a U.S. airforce base at the time). This was part of his
apprenticeship in the Canadian Weather Service.<P>

Goose Bay, Labrador 1996.
Daley is lonely, spending a lot of time alone in his humble room in the
army barracks. It's cold and there's not much to do. The smell of jet
fuel is all pervasive and the Delta Dagger Interceptors and KC 135
tankers roar overhead at all hours of day and night. They
support and refuel B52 bombers in flight.<P>

Daley decides to try an experiment. Working alone in his room at night,
he makes up little blue cards for all the American airmen to fill out
while flying missions in the area. From these cards Daley works out a
local theory for the behaviour of atmospheric turbulence in the area.
He spends a lot of time pouring over maps spread out on his bed late
at night, entering the data from the cards onto the maps. The pilots
are very interested and cooperative because ultimately knowing the
patterns of upper level turbulence along the Labrador coast will help
them fly better. They start hanging around his room and talking about
the air in which they fly. Daley realizes he loves this research and
decides to go back to university to get a degree in meteorology.<P>
	
<B>History</B>:
<UL>
<LI> 1966-67 served as weather forecaster at Goose Bay Air Base (USAF), in Goose Bay, Labrador.
<LI> 1971-1992 Amanuensis, Copenhagen U., Denmark
<LI> 1972-78 Canadian Meterological Centre, Montreal, developing forecast models
<LI>1978-85 National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, CO as senior scientist
<LI>1985-present: Canadian Climate Centre, Downsview, ON Chief Scientist	
<LI> Wrote the book on atmospheric data analysis (1991)	
</UL>
<P>

<B>The Young Scientist</B>:
Daley grew up in West <A HREF="http://www.vcn.bc.ca/welcome/">Vancouver</A> and the North shore mountains were his
backyard. He climbed, skied and boated a lot. His best subject in
high-school was history but he was always good in math. He saw math as
a doorway to science, but he never wanted to be a research scientist.
He always wanted to do something that related to "normal" life. In
grade 12 he had no intention of studying science.<P>

<H3>1. Real Earth</H3>

The Earth's weather is a very complex system affected by
ocean currents, temperature, pressure, wind, and many
other things.<P>

<H3>2. Weather Satellite</H3>

Several Canadian weather satellites detect many of the
factors that create weather. They send this information
back to Earth.<P>

<H3>3. Super computer</H3>

A supercomputer in Montreal (Programmed in part by Roger
Daley) records and interprets information from
the satellite and other sources.<P>

<H3>4. Model Earth</H3>

The weather computer constructs a model of the earth
based on very complicated mathematical formulas. This model can be used
to help predict the weather.<P>

<B>Activity</B>:
You need:<P>
<UL>
  <LI> a cup of black coffee
  <LI> a little bit of milk or cream
  <LI> a ruler
  <LI> a watch or stopwatch.
</UL>
<P>

Imagine that the whirling coffee represents the motion of air in the
atmosphere. The whitish milk represents a trace gas. By following the
motion of the milk, knowing the size of the cup and using a stopwatch
to measure the passage of time, you can determine the velocity of the
moving coffee. How good are your velocity measurements when the milk
and coffee become well mixed?<P>

The idea is to stir the coffee very very slowly, then drop milk in slowly.
Note how the milk mixes and measure the speed of its rotation. Do
this by using the radius (r) (measure the distance from the center to
where the drop fell) and formula 2*pi*r to get the distance the milk
travels in one rotation. Use the watch to time how long one rotation
takes. The speed of the whirling mixture is the distance/time. This is
how meteorologists work out speed of moving clouds and storms in the
upper atmosphere. They have satellites that can "see" certain
naturally occurring gasses in the atmosphere, like methane from bogs.
They "track" this methane as it moves about in the atmosphere, just
like the milk in the coffee cup and figure out wind speeds in the
exactly the same way you did in the experiment.<P>

<B>Mystery</B>:
Daley hopes future generations will help develop a huge
computer system that will be able to model all the geophysical systems
in the world. Among other things, such a system would allow us to
accurately predict the formation of ozone holes and trends in <A HREF="http://www.covis.nwu.edu/globalWarming/global.html">global
