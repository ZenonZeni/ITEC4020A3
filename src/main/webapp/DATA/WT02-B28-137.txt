<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Long-Term Care: What You Need To Know</STRONG></FONT><P>

<P>
Consumers are increasingly becoming aware that sound retirement
planning must take into account the need for and cost of long-term
care services, and for good reason. Studies show that 60% of the
people who reach age 65 will need long-term care services<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#1">1</A></SUP> during
their lifetime, with 40% requiring a stay in a nursing home<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#2">2</A></SUP>. 
As people live longer, those odds will increase.  <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Changing Times Bring New Concerns</STRONG>
<BR>
Most of us know at least one person who has stayed in a nursing
home or needed professional home health care.  The financial consequences
of long-term health care can have a significant impact on a family's
savings and lifestyle.  According to the <I>Health Care Financing
Administration (Fall 1992)</I>, over 56% of long-term home health
care expenses are paid, out-of-pocket, by the patients and their
families.  Those accumulated expenses can use up a major part
of your savings.  For people who enter a nursing home, the financial
outcome can be worse: according to the Congressional Subcommittee
on Aging, <I>70 to 80% of nursing home residents deplete their
assets within twelve months</I>.  <BR>

<P>
To understand this increasing need to plan for the financial impact
of long-term care services, it's necessary to understand basic
changes taking place in American society.  According to the U.S.
Census, there were 32 million people age 65 and older in 1990-but
by the year 2030, this figure could double to 64.6 million.  Moreover,
people are living longer today than ever before.  By the year
2040, there may be more people over age 85 than there are over
65 today.  Not only are we getting older but, over the next 50
years, working age population may increase only 2 to 18%, while
the elderly population is expected to increase anywhere from 139
to 169%.  <BR>

<P>
For years, it was tradition for adult children to take care of
their parents during the &quot;golden years&quot;.  But changing
times have brought an increase in dual-career families, job insecurity,
family mobility, and divorce.  Today, many adult children are
not able to stay home and look after their own children, let alone
an aging parent.  In addition, corporate downsizing has eliminated
thousands of mid-management jobs throughout the country; consequently,
many adult children are not in a position to financially help
their parents as they had planned.  Add to this the increasing
uncertainty of health care benefits for senior citizens, and a
giant question mark looms on the horizon.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Who Will Pay For Long-Term Care?  Not Uncle Sam.</STRONG>
<BR>
Who will support this population and help pay its inevitable medical
bills?  The writing is on the wall.  According to Alice M. Rivlin
and Joshua M. Weiner, authors of <I>Caring for the Disabled Elderly</I>
(published by the Brookings Institution), the combination of aging
Baby Boomers and an increase in the longevity of the aged will
dramatically heighten the need for more public and private spending.
 But when it comes time to pay the bill, no federal programs-Social
Security, Medicare, or Medicaid will pay for all long-term care
expenses.  <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>How &quot;Secure&quot; Is Social Security?</STRONG>
<BR>
Social Security is not a savings account that builds up over time.
 It is a &quot;pay as you go&quot; system, paid for through payroll
taxes on present employees to support former workers.  Today,
according to the Social Security Administration, each retired
Social Security beneficiary is supported by the payroll taxes
of 3.3 workers.  By 2020, it's estimated that each Social Security
beneficiary will be supported by the payroll taxes of 1.9 workers.
 According to the Social Security system, payroll taxes would
have to increase by almost 60% for the system to remain solvent
and provide the same level of benefits in the future.  <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Don't Bank On Medicare Or Medicaid</STRONG>
<BR>
Although Medicare provides health coverage for senior citizens,
it is limited in the area of long-term care coverage.  In 1992,
Medicare paid a total of 4.3% of all nursing home care expenses
in the country, and 9.5% of long-term home health care expenses<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#3">3</A></SUP>,
primarily for nursing home and home health care services immediately
following a hospital stay.   Medicare generally will not cover
the cost of nursing home or home health care services due to a
chronic condition.  Medicaid, on the other hand, will cover the
cost of long-term care, but there's one catch: to qualify, you
must become indigent (&quot;spend down&quot; your assets).  Remember:
once you have depleted your assets, you have also lost control
over where and when you receive care.  Also, because of state
and federal budget cutbacks, the facilities close to your family
and friends might not have openings for Medicaid patients at the
time you need care.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>What are the options?</STRONG>
<BR>
If  Medicare won't pay, and spending down your assets to qualify
for Medicaid is not attractive, the cost of any required long-term care services may be paid for out of current income and savings,
as by long-term care insurance.  And, long-term care can be very
expensive.  In 1994, nursing  home care averaged $36,000 per year
nationally<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#4">4</A></SUP>, but costs substantially more in some states.
 Home care usually is less expensive, but full-time home care
can cost as much as a nursing home stay.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>What Does Long-Term Care Insurance Cover?</STRONG>
<BR>
Long-term care insurance usually pays for skilled, intermediate,
or custodial care in a nursing home.  It can also cover professional
&quot;at-home&quot; health care.  This type of insurance can help
pay for a variety of home and community-based care services, including:
physical, speech, and occupational therapists; home health aides
and visiting nurses; adult day care, and hospice care.  (Note:
Generally, <I>skilled care</I> refers to round-the-clock treatment
by a registered nurse under a doctor's supervision. <I> Intermediate
care</I> refers to occasional nursing and rehabilitative care
under the supervision of skilled medical personnel.  <I>Custodial
care</I> primarily meets personal care needs in activities of
daily living such as help in eating or bathing.) Typically, long-term
care insurance policies pay up to a specific dollar amount day
(which may be less than the total cost of the services provided).
 Few, if any, policies provide full coverage for all expenses.
<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>More Information is Available</STRONG>
<BR>
HIAA publishes a booklet, &quot;The Consumer's Guide To Long-Term
Care Insurance,&quot; which provides basic information on long-term
care and long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance may
not be for everybody, so it is important to research the subject
carefully.  Your agent can help you make an educated decision.
