THE 1990s:  DECADE OF CONVERGENCE

     As we move into the 1990s, companies are gearing up for the
convergence of various ISDN products along with the networks.
ISDN users, stranded on "islands" for the time being, are peering
across the vast spaces that separate the different switching
products and are beginning to build the pylons to connect these
islands.
     These pylons are represented as international ISDN standards
that have been adopted along with implementors' agreements being
cultivated by various companies.  These implementor agreements or
confidentiality agreements with developers and various companies
are often only hinted at in the various interviews we have had of
late.
     Make no mistake about it:  Vendors, RBOCs, and resellers are
jockeying for position and working on strategic alliances.
Everyone seems to have an ISDN laboratory either in the planning
stages or newly opened to test their equipment with that of
developers.
     Less then 2 years ago, the laboratory work was being
delegated to Bellcore, BNR in Canada, and AT&T Labs in
Naperville, Ill.  Then the RBOCs, first Southwestern Bell,
decided they needed their own private testing laboratories.
     Northern Telecom is also a player with major testing
facilities in North Carolina and Texas, not to mention its
affiliation with BNR in Canada.
     Even the consulting firms such as Andersen Consulting (ISDN
NEWS, Dec. 6, 1989, p. 2) are offering laboratories for the
testing of ISDN services as well as for the development of
applications.  Just recently, Hayes Microcomputers has added its
laboratory in Atlanta to the growing list of testing facilities.
     The development of these laboratories across the United
States and Canada illustrates the importance of applications
development along with the integration of systems and switches.

Standards organizations are cooperating

     The Consultative Committee on International Telegraph and
Telephone (CCITT), sponsored by the United Nations and located in
Geneva, Switzerland, has been making advances for the last year
toward other regional standards bodies.  These include the NIU-
Forum and others stressing the need for working together and not
duplicating efforts.
     Speculation is that the CCITT is concerned about its future
role in the standards implementation process because regional
standards bodies are proliferating rapidly, meet more frequently,
and can implement changes more quickly.
     Other standards groups are also forming alliances.  The
Corporation for Open Systems (COS) and its European counterpart,
the Standards Promotion and Applications Group (SPAG), have also
begun to form alliances with each other as well as their Japanese
counterpart, the Promoting Conference for OSI (POSI).  Australia,
of course, has a users' group supported by Telecom Australia, and
Canada has just formed a users group.   These affiliations around
the globe are heralding the 1990s as "The Decade of Convergence."
     Studies have indicated that these early days for ISDN
include only 1/10 of one percent of the telephone lines in the
United States.  The RBOC trials and commercial services updated
this month in ISDN NEWS indicate extensive growth at Bell
Atlantic and U S West in the United States.
     From the United Kingdom, Ovum Ltd. reports that 50,000 ISDN
lines will be equipped for data by 1990, 280,000 in 1991, and
800,000 in 1992.  These ISDN lines will have to be interoperable
to meet their full potential.
     Dennis Hayes, president and co-founder of Hayes
Microproducts, told ISDN NEWS that the United States is on the
"verge of 5 years of ISDN" and predicts significant growth in
ISDN in the next 5-7 years.  He expects it will take the same
amount of time for the ISDN market to mature as it did the
videotape player market.
     If the standards, applications, and interoperability testing
is being stressed in corporation laboratories, as well as
standards and users organizations around the world, it is highly
likely that ISDN will be interoperable on a normal basis, not
trial, by the middle of the decade.

HAYES RAISES ISDN IMAGE WITH PC ADAPTOR & SUPPORT PROGRAM

     Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. is promising access to
ISDN services for IBM PCs and compatible computers by mid-1990
with an internal ISDN PC Adaptor.  The product is based on
CCITT's basic rate interface (BRI), and supports both Northern
Telecom's and AT&T central office switches, X.25, and the
American National Standard's Institute (ANSI) high-speed data
transfer rates for circuit and packet-switched data.  The
estimated retail price is $1,599.  Dennis Hayes, president and
co-founder of the corporation, told ISDN NEWS the product had 6
revisions in 4 years and would be sold through telcos, large
systems integrators, and 2-4 technically qualified resellers.
     Expecting to have to "educate the sellers" as well as
activate the market with its support program for software
developers, Hayes reminisced that his company would do the same
thing it did for modems over 10 years ago.  However, he concluded
it had not been necessary to spend time with switch manufacturers
and service providers to develop capabilities with the early
modem market.
     "We see the market as a high-end segment above the dial-up
modem market," and expects ISDN to "change the way a company does
business with point-of sales, electronic banking, error control,
data compression, and other advanced applications for speed and
performance driving."

Broader market in possibly 18 months

     Hayes said that "in the next 18 months or when it gets to
the point long-distance ISDN is in operation, service is
tariffed, and we know everyone knows how to order service, we
expect to broaden the reseller base to LAN networks."
     Infrastructure is needed to support new products because
resellers do not know how to write software for advanced
features.  Applications are of primary importance with developers
and resellers working together; and Hayes has opened a laboratory
in Atlanta supported by engineers.
     Dr. John Copeland, vice president for systems engineering at
Hayes, added, "Pressure is building up.  In the last 15 years,
speed [requirements] have gone up a factor of 10 every 5 years;
[we are] reaching the limit of the analog phone."  Hayes added,
"We're paying the price of the break up of Bell System, [but by]
working with switch manufacturers, we see things coming
together."
     In December, a beachhead in Europe and possibly Asia was
secured when GPT and Hayes formed an alliance to develop,
manufacture and distribute products for ISDN networks.  (Hayes
Microcomputer Products, Box 105203, Atlanta, GA 30348, 404/449-
8791).
