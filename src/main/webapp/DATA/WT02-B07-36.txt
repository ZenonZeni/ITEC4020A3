(1) Senator Harkin Amendment Would Expand Law Enforcement Access and Gut 
    Privacy Protections For Telephone Subscriber Information

Yesterday, CDT became aware that Senator Tom Harkin is planning to 
introduce an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and 
Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652) currently being debated on the Senate 
floor. Harkin's proposed amendment would eliminate the Fourth Amendment 
protections currently in 18 USC Sec. 2703 and would give law enforcement 
access to subscriber and customer information on telemarketers from an 
electronic communications service provider with the presentation of a 
mere written notice.  

Harkin's proposal threatens to undermine severely the privacy protections 
on personal information held by communications providers.  If Harkin's 
amendment passes, it would open the door to the future unraveling of this
section which now requires the government to present a court order, warrant, 
or subpoena in order to obtain subscriber information.

The Senate is expected to vote on the Harkin Amendment as early as today. 
CDT urges you to contact Senator Harkin to express your concern about his 
prposal.

(2) Text of CDT/ACLU Letter to Sen. Harkin

June 13, 1995

The Honorable Tom Harkin
United States Senator
SH-531 Hart Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510-1502

Dear Senator Harkin:

We are writing to register our strong opposition to your proposed 
amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 
1995 (S. 652) which would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(c)(1)(B), which 
provides privacy safeguards for telecommunication subscriber information by 
controlling government access.  Under your proposal, law enforcement 
could gain access from a telecommunications service provider to 
subscriber information upon mere submission of a "formal written 
request" where the subscriber is a telemarketer.  This proposal 
represents a severe departure from the strict Fourth Amendment framework 
that governs law enforcement access to personal communications and 
information under Title 18.  Under ¤2703, law enforcement officers must 
first present a warrant, court order, or administrative subpoena to an 
electronic communications service provider prior to disclosures of 
information about its subscribers.  This section acknowledges the 
important privacy interest people have in the personal information held 
by electronic communications service providers.  Your proposal would 
require information to be provided with fewer privacy protections than 
currently exist even in the case of a foreign counter-intelligence 
investigation.  

The Fourth Amendment privacy protections embodied in Title 18 are 
the product of a long and thorough debate in which the concerns of law 
enforcement and the rights of citizens were aired and carefully 
balanced.  Your proposed amendment would unravel this delicate balance 
without the deliberative process necessary to carve out any exception to 
standard Fourth Amendment protections.

The proposed amendment suggests that the available mechanisms 
offered in Title 18 are inadequate to address the problem of 
telemarketing fraud.  However, there has been no opportunity to create a 
record of the problem or the necessity of amending existing law.  We 
oppose weakening of court order requirements of Title 18.  We do not 
believe that this instance justifies opening the door on eliminating the 
strong Fourth Amendment privacy protections -- rendering other future 
"exceptions" to these privacy protections a virtual certainty.  

We agree, telemarketing fraud is a serious problem and we are 
available to meet with you to discuss means of addressing it.  We 
encourage you to seek hearings on this issue so that a full record is 
developed and appropriate remedies, tailored to the problem, are 
crafted.  However, we must adamantly oppose your proposed amendment to 
the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act.  We look 
forward to working with you.

(3) CDA Update -- SENATE VOTE EXPECTED TODAY OR TOMORROW

The Senate vote on the Communications Decency Act will occurr either today
(6/14) or tomorrow (6/15). Senator Exon has joined forces with Senator
Coats (R-IA), and has introduced a revised Exon/Coats Communications
Decency Act amendment. The text of this proposal was not available for
posting at the time of this writing, but will be made available as soon as
we have it.

The Exon/Coats proposal is reportedly similar to the earlier Exon
proposals, and would severely restrict the free speech and privacy rights
of all Internet users. In addition, the Exon/Coats proposal adds a
provision to ban the dissemination of indecency on all cable channels. This
would ban the showing of popular programs like NYPD Blue, Melrose Place,
educational programing dealing with reproduction, and other programming,
and is a clear violation of longstanding Constitutional precedent.

Senator Leahy plans to offer his alternative (S. 714) during the debate
today, but the outcome at this point is uncertain. Your help is needed now.
For instructions on what you can do (including a list of Senate Contacts),
send a message to vtw@vtw.org with a subject "send alert" (w/o the quotes).

CDT is closely following developments on this issue, and will post further
information as soon as it becomes available.
