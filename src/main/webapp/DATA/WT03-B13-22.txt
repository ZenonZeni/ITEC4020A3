           Welcome to the first issue of THE SPECTRUM REPORT, the
latest addition to the Phillips Publishing, Inc. family of
newsletters.
           The battle for radio frequency among competing services
is heating up, and the issues surrounding its allocation are
becoming increasingly critical to all services that use spectrum.
Spectrum issues are a growing concern to the readers of
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, PCN NEWS, SATELLITE NEWS, MOBILE
SATELLITE NEWS, DBS NEWS and MOBILE PHONE NEWS.  To give our
readers the breadth of perspective needed to protect their
interests in this battle, THE SPECTRUM REPORT provides
comprehensive news and analysis on spectrum allocation issues
across all services.
           Every other week, THE SPECTRUM REPORT will provide the
most in-depth coverage of issues critical to the global
allocation of frequency including regulatory actions, WARC '92,
new technologies and international coverage.  Now here's the
news:

BROADCASTERS MAY BE HIT WITH SPECTRUM TAX; NAB READY TO FIGHT

           The Treasury Department is rumored to be drafting
spectrum tax legislation to combat the growing deficit; the
National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) said it is prepared to
fight.  The federal government is "desperate for money" and on
the surface this is an attractive idea, NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel
told THE SPECTRUM REPORT.  The Congressional Budget Office
estimated the deficit for fiscal year 1991 at $253 billion and
$262 billion the following year.
           Administration officials had drafted similar
legislation last year in an effort to cut the budget deficit by
$50 billion.  Under the previous plan, most stations would be
required to pay 5% of their annual revenue for use of the
spectrum.  Smaller broadcasters--television stations generating
less than $2 million in annual revenues and radio stations making
less than $100,000 per year--would be required to pay 2.5% of
their revenues.
           "It's pretty clear that once on the table, you never
get off the table," Wurfel said.  We feel it will be part of the
budget plan in some way, he added.
           The NAB is opposed to a spectrum tax, said Wurfel.  "We
don't believe it would be fair to tax broadcasters because
broadcasters provide a lot of community service," he told us.
           Wurfel said he wanted to make it clear that NAB is
opposed to a tax--a fee assessed annually on all broadcasters.  A
tax is not the same as a spectrum fee such as a one time charge
on newly unallocated spectrum, he said.
           "That's not to say we are for fees of any kind or [for]
spectrum auctions--we've never really been enthusiastic about
anything that represents fees on spectrum," Wurfel told us.
           Wurfel said there will be hearings in the spring.
"Some believe we need to pay more than simply providing public
service.  We'll be preparing for these hearings and discussions
on the Hill to point out what broadcasters do for the community
and the responsibilities we take--which is the way we pay for
spectrum," he said.
           The bill is said to be drafted so that it would fall
under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance and House Ways and
Means Committees rather than the Commerce Committees.
Broadcasters also are against this set-up of the bill because the
Commerce Committee handles broadcast issues and thus, has a
better understanding of the industry.
           NAB said the first place it expects to see spectrum
fees is when President Bush sends his budget to Congress--the
first Monday in February.  It has been rumored that the president
will mention it in his State of the Union address but, Wurfel
said that "it's an outside chance."

The Dingell Bill Will Come to Life Again This Year

           Although broadcasters may be hit by a spectrum tax,
some good news still may come for other spectrum users in the
legislative process.  Dennis Fitzgibbons, spokesman for House and
Energy Commerce Committee, told THE SPECTRUM REPORT that the bill
introduced by House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D-
Mich.) will, indeed, be introduced again early this session.  "It
will be much the same bill as before," Fitzgibbons told us.
           The Dingell bill, if passed, will free up some 200 MHz
of government-owned spectrum.  The bill passed the House last
year but not the Senate.  "Essentially the bill sets up a
mechanism in which commercial users could use the spectrum," said
Fitzgibbons.
           "For 20 years or more there has been talk of some type
of transfer of federal spectrum to the private sector.  This is
the first concrete move in that direction.  We have to recognize
John Dingell for his foresight," E.B. Kitchen, president of the
National Association of Business & Educational Radio told us.

Kitchen: Auctions May Have Held the Dingell Bill Up Last Year

           Kitchen said he believed the bill faired well by
passing the House but not the Senate, and that he was
"optimistic" that it will pass the next time.  "The hangup was
the whole issue of auctions.  The bill had language that
prohibited the auction of the 200 MHz of government spectrum and
the Republicans did not want that limitation--they wanted that
option," said Kitchen.
           The bill probably will be reintroduced without that
language, Kitchen speculated.  If the bill does not include the
auction clause, Kitchen said he believed the bill will pass.
           "I would rather have the Dingell bill pass even without
the auction exclusion.  We'll fight the auction battle another
day," added Kitchen.
           Hearings and mark-ups for the Dingell bill probably
will occur in February, Fitzgibbons told us.

FCC RADIO CHIEF SAYS TECHNOLOGY
GREATEST HOPE IN SPECTRUM FIGHT

           Emphasizing the need for improved technologies and more
efficient use of existing radio spectrum, Ralph Haller, chief of
the FCC's Private Radio Bureau said, "the current lack of
spectrum has troublesome competitive implications for our
country."
     Speaking at the recent general membership session of the
Special Industrial Radio Service Association Inc. (SIRSA) in San
Diego, Calif., Haller stressed the importance of radio.  "When
economic times are tough, radio's ability to save time and money
assumes ever greater importance," he said.
     Haller pointed to several time saving devices of the radio
including radio controlled traffic lights that enable traffic to
flow more quickly, security devices that call the police when
someone steals your car and vast pipeline networks across the
United States which are controlled remotely via radio links.
Haller said radio also offers new technologies for the future.
For instance, up-to-date maps displayed on the dashboard of cars
and personal communication devices.  But, he said the downside to
"all of these nifty new uses" is that they require spectrum.
           "For those of you out there who are accustomed to
thinking about radio frequencies in proprietary terms, I think it
is going to be harder and harder to maintain high walls around
`your' frequencies," said Haller.  As spectrum becomes more
valuable, those who don't use their frequencies will find
themselves under pressure from those who have an immediate and
pressing need for them," he added.

What are the Answers?

           Haller said there probably will be a need for channel
pools to serve the radio users with similar interests.  The
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), a unit of the Commerce Department, is encouraging federal
agencies to pool their channels to operate trunked systems.  NTIA
has released a request for proposals that might result in trunked
multi-user systems that are managed by private companies.
           "I also think that more spectrum sharing will be one
response to try to accommodate these needs," said Haller, "and I
don't necessarily mean sharing in the traditional sense."  By
using digital packet radio to fill pockets of otherwise dead air
time (the pauses between the words of natural speech),
individuals can increase the amount of frequency sharing without
a perceptible increase in channel congestion, said Haller.
           "Technology, of course, is the greatest hope for
spectrum salvation," he said.  Haller said the FCC is examining
time division multiple access (TDMA) digital modulation and code
division multiple access (CDMA) technologies to "create" more
spectrum.
           The new transmission schemes, CDMA and TDMA, are
associated most often with personal communication services.
"There is pressure for the U.S. to do even more in this fast
moving area lest we fall behind Europe and Japan," he said.

The FCC Supports New Technologies Through Pioneer Preference

           Haller said the FCC is faced with the task of "trying
to find new ways to do more with less."  The FCC is trying to
accommodate new services through pioneer preference--giving
pioneers of new communication services a preference in the
spectrum allocation process.
           The private radio version of this pioneer's preference
recently was adopted by the FCC.  The commission proposed that
people who find an idle private radio channel that is subject to
FCC takeback be rewarded for their efforts by getting "first
crack" at being licensed on that channel, said Haller.  "In
effect, valuable unused radio spectrum could be recycled," he
explained.
           Another way the Private Radio Bureau is trying to do
more with less is through conditional licensing processing.
Applicants on certain shared private radio frequencies may, if
they certify to having met specific criteria, can begin operation
under temporary authority immediately upon sending their license
documents to the FCC, said Haller.
           In order to "create" more spectrum, said Haller, the
FCC is looking at the possibility of refarming the spectrum below
450 MHz.  "This spectrum is almost always shared and often
crowded--with new technology, we should be able to bring relief
to users," he said.
           Additionally, Haller said the FCC recently concluded an
agreement with the Department of Communications of Canada to use
frequencies in the 821-824/866-869 MHz (public safety) and the
896-901/935-940 MHz (business and industrial land transportation)
bands within 87 miles of the United States and Canadian border.
           "Licensing in the bands can begin immediately which
should result in improved mobile communications service to the
public," said Haller.

What Can Spectrum Users Do?

           The FCC is not the only party with a role to play in
fostering technological advances, innovation, better regulation
and wiser use of the spectrum, said Haller.  As the demand for
spectrum increases, Haller said the FCC will be forced to
encourage spectrum efficiency, even to demand it.
           "I encourage you to start thinking in terms of radio as
a scarce resource than as a box with an antenna that is a minor
adjunct to your main business."

PUBLIC SAFETY LEANING TOWARD FDMA DIGITAL STANDARD

           NEW YORK CITY--Project 25, the brainchild of Associated
Public-Safety Communications Officers (APCO), together with the
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors
(NASTD) and various governmental agencies, is leaning heavily
toward choosing frequency division multiple access (FDMA) in its
quest for a digital standard for public safety radio.
           "[Project 25] made a decision that the future [digital]
public safety systems will use FDMA [frequency division multiple
access], providing an immediate improvement of 2-1," Stuart
Meyer, Project 25 committee member, told an audience recently at
the Technical Symposium at the Radio Club of America's 81st
Anniversary Dinner, held at the New York Athletic Club.
           J. Sharpe Smith, editor of our sister publication
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, was at the dinner and reports that as
soon as better voice coding is developed, a 4-1 spectrum
improvement will be achieved.
           The technical committee of Project 25 has recommended
FDMA, and the steering committee has given its blessing but it
wants more information about which modulation scheme will be
chosen.  The modulation scheme choices include c/4 BPQSK and 4-
Level FSK [frequency shift key].  c/4 requires linear amplifiers,
while the other method does not.

Spectrum Shortage Spurred Digital Standards Development

           In 1988, Congress mandated 6 MHz more spectrum in the
800 MHz band.  Since then, Public Safety has run low of spectrum,
and in some metropolitan areas, has run out.  The FCC has
countered calls for more spectrum allocation with a challenge to
improve spectrum efficiency.  Project 25 was Public Safety's
answer to the FCC.  It probably will go back to the FCC with
suggestions in the next 12-18 months, which may lead to a Notice
of Proposed Rule Making.
           "The FCC has come out with a Notice of Inquiry and said
to Public Safety, `you folks made out pretty good with this
federally mandated spectrum, but what are you going to do about
tomorrow?'" Meyer said.  "The commission went on to suggest that
Public Safety look at more spectrally efficient modulation
techniques in the future."  National Public Safety Planning
Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) developed a channel splitting plan,
from 25-12.5 KHz, which provided an easily implementable plan in
the past.  Meyer, a member of NPSPAC, described the formulation
of digital standards as the next step.
           The committee considered 3 access schemes: code
division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access
(TDMA) and FDMA.  Project 25's major concerns include spectrum
efficiency, encryption and quality of signal.  The committee
decided that CDMA would not fill the needs of Public Safety and
government radio.  "We cannot use CDMA because it requires large
contiguous blocks of spectrum, which we don't have," said Art
McDole, project steering board member and technical advisor.
           TDMA, while popular with the cellular industry, has
some special requirements that hurt it in the Public Safety
arena.  TDMA requires a central controller to select the time
slot.  "When we are looking at a dozen independent police
stations, with a few mobiles each, that don't want to work into a
common system, we start to get problems with TDMA," McDole said.
Another problem of TDMA is its need for linear amplifiers, which
are not as efficient as Class C amplifiers or non-linear
amplifiers, McDole added.
           "We've done a tremendous amount of work with the
manufacturers, weighing the merits of FDMA versus TDMA," McDole
said.  "We have not taken a positive and final action...but we
are leaning heavily toward FDMA, because of the problems of
adapting TDMA to [Public Safety]."

FDMA is Good for Starters

           "FDMA fits into our current time constraints.  It isn't
the step forward that we hoped for.  It is a short-term answer.
What we are looking for is a clear migration to advanced
technology to improve spectrum efficiency," said Craig Jorgensen,
NASTD immediate past president.  "Theoretically, TDMA helps us
with spectrum efficiency, but the linear amplifiers are a
critical issue to power consumption."  There is some question
about a non-ionizing radiation problem with TDMA, which could
cause cell tissue damage to the user, but it hasn't been proven
yet, Jorgensen added.
           "We want to find a migration path to new technology, 4-
5 years down the line, to be more spectrally efficient,"
Jorgensen said.  "We also want flexibility within the standard to
allow for enhanced features."
           Why have standards?  "First, we must intercommunicate.
We must be able to talk with each other during a disaster," said
McDole.
           "There are a thousand reasons that we can't have one
system that can't talk to another."  Standards also allow a user
to have multiple sources and possibly lower prices.

Group Will Study How Digital Modulation Affects Spectrum
Requirements

           Project 25, which has been in existence for one year,
has a steering committee, currently co-chaired by John Powell,
APCO vice president, and Jorgensen.  The steering committee,
which will make the final decision, consists of 3 members of each
organization and 3 members from the federal government.  Two
subcommittees were established under the steering committee: a
technical group and a spectrum group.
           "I think that we've gotten into a huge, huge arena,"
said McDole.  "Recognizing the scope of what we have to do, I
think that we've made excellent progress."
           The technical group is responsible for working out all
of the details of the standard relating to access and modulation
methods.  The spectrum group is concentrating on the logistics of
migrating from analog to digital technology and how it will
affect the spectrum requirements.  Each subcommittee is open to
industry participation.
           "All of the manufacturers are represented on both of
the committees, and we have input from all of the branches of the
federal government," McDole said.  "A number of manufacturers,
including GE and Motorola, have made presentations to the Project
25 committee."

TIA Will Help to Formulate Standards

           In an FCC filing, Project 25 said it looked forward to
working with the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA),
but it officially has not begun its relationship with the
association.  TIA is a trade organization that makes it possible
for competing manufacturers to meet in the same room and help
formulate standards and avoid antitrust problems.       Once the
standard is written, project principals are hoping for industry
acceptance, not a mandated standard.
           "[TIA has] offered help to assist them, but it is still
waiting for their response," Meyer said.  Jorgensen anticipates
that TIA will be brought in as early as mid-February, and he
called the participation of the association "critical" to the
success of the venture.

WARC CHALLENGE--FINDING SPECTRUM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES

           The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC)
challenge in 1992, said Bob Raish with the law firm Fletcher,
Heald and Hildreth, is to decide how to superimpose all the new
communications technology upon a spectrum that is totally
allocated.
           Raish, speaking at the recent forum, "WARC '92:
Allocations for the Year 2000 and Beyond," sponsored by the
Washington Annenburg Program, said the most critical focus will
be on the 1-3 GHz band where new technology requirements already
exist for a substantial portion
and where the "have or have not" confrontation is the greatest
due to industry interests.
           "There must be a balance between spectrum accommodation
and technological advancement," said Raish.  Raish also said the
United States faces a dilemma: whether it should keep up with
competition or remain entrenched.
           Travis Marshall, senior vice president and director of
government relations at Motorola, said the market should drive
allocations, not technology.
           "The mobile radio is an explosive growth area doubling
spectrum needs every 5 years," said Marshall.
           However, Michael Rau of the National Association for
Broadcasters (NAB) did not seem as optimistic about the effects
of WARC '92.  Rau said U.S. broadcasters do not need the WARC.
"The WARC issue concerns satellite-delivered high-definition
television (HDTV)," said Rau.  NAB does not believe HDTV is
needed in the United States.
           Rau also said that he did not feel the United States
should adopt a position that favors entrepreneurial technology,
especially if that technology duplicates existing services that
are meeting consumers needs.  "The U.S. should focus on pragmatic
policy rather than idealistic or theoretical frameworks," added
Rau.  Look for more coverage on the WARC forum in our next
issue.

           *The Association for Maximum Service Television Inc.
(MSTV) recently filed comments to the FCC addressing the proposal to
use the UHF band for the developing digital audio broadcasting (DAB)
service.  MSTV said "there is one clear certainty: advanced
television (ATV) and DAB cannot `share' the UHF television band."
MSTV said that industry has invested billions in the development of
ATV transmission systems and tens of millions in the development and
installation of testing and evaluation capabilities.  "It is now
certain that terrestrial ATV will require every last remaining piece
of the UHF band in major markets for years to come," said MSTV in its
filing.  Additionally, MSTV said that even if ATV's use of the UHF
band were not contemplated, sharing of the band with existing NTSC
stations "would be costly and impractical."  (The Association for

           *Nynex Corp. recently submitted its comments to the FCC
discussing the spectrum allocation requirements for personal
communication services (PCS).  Nynex said it agreed with the
commission in its view that an exclusive allocation for land
mobile services and specifically personal portable wireless
services is neither necessary nor appropriate.       "As recent
advances in the cellular industry demonstrate, technology and a
flexible regulatory approach can assist in making more efficient
use of existing spectrum to provide a range of quality services
such as personal communication services," said Nynex in its
comments.  Nynex also said the deployment of a technology that
permits the sharing of frequencies is "a more practical and
viable approach to the development of new wireless service
offerings" than the WARC proposal.  The WARC proposal would
require the reallocation of frequencies on an exclusive basis.
Nynex has applied to the FCC for an experimental license to test
the feasibility of sharing spectrum in the 1850-1990 MHz range

techniques.  (Nynex Corp., 1113 West Chester Ave., White Plains,

HUGHES NETWORK SYSTEMS SUPPORTS THE NEW TDMA TECHNOLOGY

           Hughes Network Systems (HNS) recently announced that it
will manufacture cellular telephones using the radical new TDMA-
compatible technology, Extended Time Division Multiple Access (E-
TDMA) technology, which is promising 15 times analog capacity,
from International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMM).
           HNS will create a nationwide cellular services network,
offering customers one-stop shopping for cellular phones at
General Motors dealers.  The company, owned by GM Hughes
Electronics, will offer dual-mode phones, switches and cell site
equipment on a turnkey basis to carriers.  HNS will supply the
switches through a long-term agreement with France-based Alcatel.
           "Everyone is vigorously trying to update the technology
and increase  spectrum efficiency," said Robert Wysor,
consultant, Economic & Management Consultants Inc. (EMCI).  "In
the long run, that is very good for the industry."

A `Voice Activated Channel' Will Employ Unused Channel Capacity

           E-TDMA achieves 15 times analog capacity versus 3 times
analog, which is the current TDMA expectation, by using digital
speech interpolation (DSI).  This technique assigns the channel
only when the person is speaking.  In other words, time slots are
only assigned during actual talk time.  In any 2-way
communication, 65% of the channel capacity goes unused, because
while one person speaks the other channel remains silent.  IMM's
answer to the dilemma of accessing that unused capacity could be
called a "voice-activated channel."
           "The Hughes proposal will only assign a channel to
someone when they are speaking," said George Calhoun, IMM senior
vice president.  "So when they are not speaking, they don't take
up any part of [the] channel."
           In the existing TDMA technology, a user receives a
periodic time slot whether he is speaking or not, and silence is
broadcast to the one who is talking.  E-TDMA takes advantage of
the silent time slots.

Hughes' Phones Will be Compatible with Current Standard

           The Hughes dual-mode phones will be compatible with the
industry standard.  "It uses the same slot structure [6-slots],
same channel structure, same 30 KHz bandwidth, as in IS-54.  It
fits within that framework without any modification.  It uses the
slots for different purposes, and some of the control information
is different but it is allowed by the standard," Calhoun said.
           "IS-54 provides the framework in which other things can
be implemented, but it's certainly not the end of the line.  The
belief that CDMA was 20 times and TDMA was 3 times was simply
wrong," said Calhoun.
