The awardee shall not take any irreversible action (such as demolition of 
facilities or start of
 construction) pursuant to any agreement, prior to DOE completing a NEPA 
review in

information provided by the applicant on the Environmental Checklist will 
be used to assist DOE in reaching its determination.  A copy of the 
Instructions to the Preparer has been provided to aid the
