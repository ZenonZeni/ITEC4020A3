<P>
MTH (methamphetamine) is infrequently researched as a treatment option for childhood attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), even though it has FDA-approved labeling for the disorder.  The may be due to MTH's reputation for high abuse liability.  In a recent issue of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, Dr. Paul Wender states that MTH "in clinical treatment of children is neither renegade nor experimental, and it should not be considered controversial."  For information, call the Child Psychopharmacology Information Center at 608/262-6171.

<A NAME = "newst"><H2>NEW STUDY ON BIPOLAR DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A new treatment-outcome and research network dedicated to the study of manic-depressive illness, the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network, includes national and international researchers and expert clinicians working in close association with NAMI and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association (NDMDA). 
<P>
These groups will work together to assess the efficacy of existing treatments for bipolar disorder and the development of new therapeutic agents.  Participating research centers will recruit and treat patients with bipolar illness using standard protocols and assessments within randomized clinical trials. 
<P>
"The mission of the bipolar network is to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of bipolar illness, its cause or causes, and its treatments with the goals of establishing optimal treatment strategies," said Robert Post, M.D., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Branch of NIMH. 
<P>
More information about this network is available in Bipolar Network News (BNN), a newsletter about the latest bipolar-disorder findings for patients and clinicians.  For a copy of BNN, write or fax your request to Bipolar Network News, 5430 Grosvenor Lane, Suite #200,

<A NAME = "nonco"><H2>NONCOMPLIANCE AND SCHIZOPHRENIA</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
While many advances have been made in treating schizophrenia, much of the improvement has been rendered virtually meaningless in actual practice because of the persistently large percentage of patients who fail to take their medication, a researcher says.

<P>
As estimated 74 percent of outpatients with schizophrenia stop taking neuroleptics--or anti-psychotic drugs--within two years of leaving a hospital or program, Peter Weiden told the American Medical Association's (AMA) 13th Annual Science Reporters Conference in Seattle in November. 
<P>
Weiden, director of the schizophrenia program at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and assistant clinical professor at Columbia University, said the 74 percent estimate is likely low because it does not take into account persons with schizophrenia who refuse treatment or drift from one place to another.
<P>
Non-compliance is different in people suffering from schizophrenia than in those with other chronic problems (such as diabetes) who "eventually figure out they need medicine," Weiden said.  It has been shown that persons with schizophrenia have the type of brain disorder that makes it difficult for them to learn from experience.  "One of the symptoms of their illness is they don't know they're sick," according to Weiden.
<P>
Non-compliance accounts for at least 40 percent of all episodes of schizophrenic relapse and subsequent rehospitalization, Weiden says, and the relapses suffered by persons off their medication are often more severe and difficult to treat.
<P>
Resources devoted to developing new drugs should be coupled with research on why patients stop taking their medication.  "The difference between being on treatment and off treatment magnifies as drugs get better," Weiden told his audience.  Research into the non-compliance problem is "virtually non-existent," he said.
<P>

<A NAME = "obses"><H2>OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
-- A woman visits her dermatologist, complaining of extremely dry
skin and seldom feeling clean. She showers for two hours every
day.
<P>
-- A lawyer insists on making coffee several times each day. His
colleagues do not realize that he lives in fear that the coffee
will be poisoned, and he feels compelled to pour most of it down
the drain. The lawyer is so obsessed with these thoughts that he
spends 12 hours a day at work -- four of them worrying about
contaminated coffee.
<P>
-- A man cannot bear to throw anything away. Junk mail, old
newspapers, empty milk cartons all "could contain something
valuable that might be useful some day." If he throws things
away, "something terrible will happen." He hoards so much clutter
that he can no longer walk through his house. Insisting that
nothing be thrown away, he moves to another house where he
continues to hoard.
<P>
These people suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The
National Institute of Mental Health estimates that more than 2
percent of the U.S. population, or nearly one out of every 40
people, will suffer from OCD at some point in their lives. The
disorder is two or three times more common than schizophrenia and
manic depressive illness.
<P>
What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?
<P>
Obsessions are intrusive, irrational thoughts--un wanted ideas or
impulses that repeatedly well up in the victim's mind. Again and
again, the person experiences disturbing thoughts, such as "My
hands must be contaminated; I must wash them"; "I may have left
the gas stove on"; or "I am going to injure my child." On one
level, the sufferer knows these obsessive thoughts are
irrational. But on another level, he/she fears these thoughts
might be true. Trying to avoid such thoughts creates great
anxiety.
<P>
Compulsions are repetitive rituals such as hand washing,
counting, checking, hoarding, or arranging. An individual repeats
these actions, perhaps feeling momentary relief but without
feeling satisfaction or a sense of completion. OCD victims feel
they must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad will
happen.
<P>
Most people at one time or another experience obsessive thoughts
or compulsive behaviors. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder occurs
when an individual experiences obsessions and compulsions for
more than an hour each day, in a way that interferes with his/her
life.
<P>
OCD is often described as "a disease of doubt." Sufferers
experience "pathological doubt," unable to distinguish between
what is possible, what is probable, and what is unlikely to
happen.
<P>
Who gets OCD?
<P>
People of all ages and from all walks of life can get OCD. It
strikes people of all ethic groups, and both males and females.
Symptoms typically begin during the teenage years or young
adulthood.
<P>
What causes OCD?
<P>
The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that OCD
results from a chemical imbalance in the brain For years, mental
health professionals assumed OCD resulted from bad parenting or
personality defects.
<P>
This theory has been disproven over the last 20 years. OCD
symptoms have not been relieved by psychoanalysis or other forms
of "talk therapy".
<P>
OCD patients can often articulate insight into "why" they have
obsessive thoughts or why they behave compulsively. But the
thoughts and the behavior continue.
<P>
People whose brains are injured often develop OCD, suggesting
that it's a physical condition. If a placebo is given to people
who are depressed or who experience panic attacks, 40 percent
will say they feel better.
<P>
If a placebo is given to people who experience
obsessive-compulsive disorder, only about 2 percent say they feel
better. This also suggests a physical condition.
<P>
Brain scientists have identified the part of the brain that
causes OCD. They have discovered a strong link between OCD and a
brain chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
that helps nerve cells communicate.
<P>
Scientists have also observed that people with OCD have increased
metabolism in the basal ganglia and in the frontal lobes of the
brain.
<P>
This, scientists believe, causes repetitive movements, rigid
thinking and a lack of spontaneity. People with OCD often have
high levels of the hormone Vasopressin.
<P>
In layman's terms, something in the brain is stuck, like a broken
record. Judith Rapoport, MD, describes it in her book, The Boy
Who Couldn't Stop Washing, as "grooming behaviors gone wild."
<P>
How do people with OCD typically react to their disorder?
<P>
People with OCD generally attempt to hide their problem rather
than seek help. Often they are remarkably successful in
concealing their obsessive compulsive symptoms from friends and
co-workers.
<P>
An unfortunate consequence of this secrecy is that people with
OCD generally do not receive professional help until years after
the onset of their disease. By that time, obsessive-compulsive
habits may be deeply ingrained and very difficult to change.
<P>
How long does OCD last?
<P>
For years, even decades. The symptoms may be come less severe
from time to time, and there may be long intervals when the
symptoms are mild, but generally OCD is a chronic disease.
<P>
Is age a factor in OCD?
<P>
OCD usually starts at an early age, often before adolescence.
Left untreated, it usually grows worse with age.
<P>
It may first manifest as autism, pervasive developmental
disorder, or Tourette's Syndrome (in which the patient feels
compelled to shout obscenities and insults at random). Or it can
evolve into Tourette's Syndrome, depression and anxiety.
<P>
Like depression, OCD tends to worsen with age. But scientists
hope that if OCD patients are treated at an early age, their
symptoms won't necessarily worsen as they age.
<P>
What are some more examples of people who suffer from OCD?
<P>
People who:
<P>
-- repeatedly check things, perhaps dozens of times before
feeling secure enough to go to sleep or to leave the house. Is
the stove off? Is the door locked? Is the alarm set?
<P>
-- fear they will harm others. Example:A man's car hits a pothole
on a city street and he fears it was actually a body.
<P>
-- feel dirty and contaminated. Example: A women is fearful of
touching her baby because she might contaminate it.
<P>
-- constantly arrange and order things. Example: A child can't go
to sleep unless he lines up all his shoes correctly.
<P>
-- are excessively concerned with body imperfections (who insists
on numerous plastic surgeries or spend hours a day
body-building).
<P>
-- are ruled by numbers, believing that certain numbers represent
good and other numbers represent evil.
<P>
-- are excessively concerned with sin or blasphemy.
<P>
Is OCD commonly recognized by professionals?
<P>
Not nearly enough. OCD is often misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed.
Many people have dual diagnoses of OCD and schizophrenia, or OCD
and manic-depressive illness, but the OCD component is not
diagnosed or treated.
<P>
Researchers believe OCD, anxiety disorders and eating disorders
like anorexia and bulimia can be triggered by the same chemical
mal functioning of the brain.
<P>
Is heredity a factor in OCD?
<P>
Yes. Heredity appears to be a strong factor. If you have OCD,
there's a 25 percent chance that one of your immediate family
members will have it. It definitely seems to run in families.
<P>
Can OCD be effectively treated?
<P>
Yes, with medication and behavior therapy. Medication can
regulate serotonin, reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsive
behavior. In the last few years, several medications have been
developed that relieve many of the symptoms of OCD.
<P>
Three are particularly recommended as "serotonin selectors":
<P>
Clomipramine (brand name: Anafranil): This medication has been
used in Europe for more than 20 years, and is now available in
the United States. There is little evidence that clomipramine has
adverse long term negative effects, particularly no increased
rate of birth-defects.
<P>
But it can produce side effects: dry mouth, constipation,
tiredness, fatigue, slight hand trembling, sexual dysfunction,
severe weight gain. There is also the possibility of seizures in
high dos ages.
<P>
Fluoxetine (brand name: Prozac) and Sertraline (brand name:
Zoloft) are viewed as effective in some OCD patients but with far
fewer side-effects for most patients. Fluoxetine occasionally
causes nausea, weight loss, insomnia.
<P>
Despite sensationalized re ports that fluoxetine causes violent
behavior, the drug has been examined on numerous occasions by the
US Food and Drug Administration, and is deemed safe and
effective.
<P>
Sertraline is a relatively new drug that so far has shown fewer
side effects than fluoxetine and is substantially cheaper.
<P>
How long should an individual take medication before judging its
effectiveness?
<P>
Some physicians make the mistake of prescribing it for only three
or four weeks. That really isn't long enough. Medication should
be tried consistently for 10 or 12 weeks before judging its
effectiveness.
<P>
What is "behavior therapy" and can it effectively relieve
symptoms of OCD?
<P>
Behavior therapy is not traditional psychotherapy. It is
"exposure and response prevention," and has been found to be
effective for many people with OCD.
<P>
Patients are deliberately exposed to a feared object or idea,
either directly or by imagination, and are then discouraged or
prevented from carrying out the usual compulsive response.
<P>
For example, a compulsive hand-washer may be urged to touch an
object believed to be contaminated, and then may be denied the
opportunity to wash for several hours.
<P>
When the treatment works well, the patient gradually experiences
less anxiety from the obsessive thoughts and becomes able to
refrain from the compulsive actions for extended periods of time.
<P>
Several studies suggest that medication and behavior therapy are
equally effective in alleviating symptoms of OCD. About half the
patients improve substantially with behavior therapy; the rest
improve moderately with it.
<P>
If my relative with OCD refuses to take medication and won't
participate in behavioral therapy, are there any other
treatments?
<P>
Your relative could be a candidate for brain surgery.
<P>
Neurosurgeons in recent years have developed a finely-tuned
procedure with Magnetic Resonance Imaging to identify the part of
the brain that may be involved in expressing OCD. A surgeon can
make microscopic cuts in the brain, which often lead to a
decrease in OCD.
<P>
Will OCD symptoms go away completely with medication and behavior
therapy?
<P>
Response to treatment varies from person to person. Most people
treated with effective medications find their symptoms are
reduced by about 40 percent or 50 percent. That can often be
enough to change their lives, to transform them into functioning
individuals.
<P>
Some people are fortunate enough to go into total remission when
treated with effective medication and/or behavior therapy.
Unfortunately, some people find neither medication nor behavior
therapy has positive effects.
