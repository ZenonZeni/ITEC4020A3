				LONDON, UK&#0151;The Internet is more popular than ever. The demand for Internet services has meant that many potential customers have up to now not had a chance to experience the facilities that the World Wide Web and other services have to offer.  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Various companies have started to introduce Internet terminals, which can be accessed by the general public without the expense of buying their own personal computer. ‘Cyber Cafes’ have also been providing Internet access by making Internet-ready PCs available to the public. The most interesting of the new products is an Internet terminal, which is so simple that even the most non-computer literate users will find it easy to navigate their way around the World Wide Web, use email and keep up to date with newsgroups.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> is one solution to the global Internet shortage. Combining Windows 95 software and Intel Pentium technology with touch screen functionality, the <a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> gives instant access to the online world without even so much as a click of the mouse. Instead users can navigate their way with their fingers, by pushing buttons on the screen.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> makes it easier to access the Internet generally. Its particular advantage is that <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto (http://www.interlotto.li)</a> the world’s only true Internet Lottery becomes much simpler to play.

					One difficulty with an interface which does not include a keyboard or mouse is to enter the user names and passwords necessary for many online service including InterLotto. The problem has been solved with the addition of a card swipe system. Customers can use their credit card or a special <a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> card to access to the services they are looking for. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">

					To enable the greatest number of people to access the new terminals, <a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> are planning to install them in public meeting places such as bars and restaurants, where people will have a chance to enjoy all that the Internet has to offer.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					To ensure that language is not a barrier to using the new machines, versions of the software are available in several widely spoken languages. With internet terminal technology, the world can seem like a small place, not only for those with computers at work or at home, but for those of all nationalities around the globe.
