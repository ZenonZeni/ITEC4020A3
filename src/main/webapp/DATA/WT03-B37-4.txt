CONGRESSIONAL OUTLOOK FOR 1996 in the environmental and workplace health

CONGRESSIONAL OUTLOOK FOR 1996 in the environmental and workplace health and
safety areas is reviewed.  1996 begins with uncertainty over the future of
many bills, among them Superfund, clean water, regulatory reform, RCRA reform;
the 104th Congress is seen as extremely anti-environment by many environmental
leaders.  Many predict that there will be continued attacks on environmental
legislation by use of indirect methods, such as riders on appropriations
bills.  Superfund sites will cost $2.5 billion annually for cleanup; some
method must be used to raise more money, because Superfund itself only
provides $1 billion a year.  Environmental groups want groundwater cleanup
separate from industry cleanup responsibilities.  Tax authority for Superfund
expired on Dec. 31, 1995; the corporate environmental income tax and chemical
and petroleum excise taxes that raised Superfund monies must be reauthorized.
      A number of bills have bipartisan support:  H.R. 2036 would reform
land-disposal restrictions under RCRA; safe drinking water (S. 1316) requires
risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses to set standards, but exempts
by-products of chlorination (trihalomethanes).
      Legislation to reform OSHA failed to move in 1995, and prospects are dim
for 1996.  Bills under consideration would move OSHA away from strict
enforcement and more toward technical support and assistance to firms.  These
changes are not well supported by industry and are vigorously opposed by
labor.  (Chemical & Engineering News, pp. 14-20, Jan. 8, 1996)

BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT, revised recently, is underway.  A federal

BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT, revised recently, is underway.  A federal district
court judge ordered the printing and mailing of a revised offer to silicone
gel breast implant recipients, which promises to speed payments to them from
three major manufacturers--Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter Health Care, and
3M--but excludes Dow Corning.  Overwhelming costs of litigation forced Dow
Corning, the maker of about half of the implants, into bankruptcy.  The
revised settlement seeks to avoid thousands of court cases that would
otherwise clog the judicial system for years.  The total value of the revised
settlement is nearly impossible to assess.  (Chemical & Engineering News, pp.
15-16, Jan. 22, 1996)

DIOXIN REASSESSMENT is being examined by the House of Representatives

DIOXIN REASSESSMENT is being examined by the House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Energy & Environment in an attempt to see how science is used
by EPA.  Several hearings looked into EPA's long-running reassessment of the
health effects of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds.  The goal of the hearings
was not to determine if EPA were right or wrong but to find out if the agency
is making appropriate use of the resources available.  The implication is that
EPA has used these resources selectively to support public policy objectives
that may not stand up to more rigorous scientific scrutiny.  (Chemical &
Engineering News, p. 22, Jan. 1, 1996)

WHITE PAPER REPORT ON U.S. INDUSTRY SAFETY & HEALTH PRACTICES assesses the
impact of the anti-regulatory era in Washington, with budget, staff, and
spending plans for the coming year.  The White Paper helps safety, industrial
hygiene, and environmental professionals plan for 1996.  Data generated for
this report comes from questionnaires.  Subjects include the outlook for 1996,
industry benchmarks, plant-size benchmarks, and the regulatory outlook.  The
36-page report was prepared by Industrial Safety & Hygiene News and was issued
as a supplement to the December 1995 issue of American Industrial Hygiene
Association Journal.

DEVELOPING NATIONS have various diseases and disorders, many caused by
environmental problems.  Environmental health problems are particularly acute
in Ghana, where there is heavy metal pollution and aflatoxins, natural
carcinogens, in the diet.  LEAD (CAS RN 7439-92-1) exposure is prevalent among
artisans who smelt metal retrieved from old batteries, and effluents from
heavy industry bring MERCURY (CAS RN 7439-97-6), ARSENIC (CAS RN 7440-38-2),
ALUMINUM (CAS RN 7429-90-5), and lead into the environment.  These issues and

AIR POLLUTION review of epidemiological evidence of health effects of

AIR POLLUTION review of epidemiological evidence of health effects of
particulates is summarized.  Acute exposure to elevated levels of particulates
has been associated with increased cardiopulmonary mortality, hospitalization
for respiratory disease, and increased incidence and duration of respiratory
symptoms, as well as exacerbation of asthma, declines in lung function, and
restricted activity.  Small deficits in lung function, higher risk of chronic
respiratory disease and symptoms, and increased mortality have also been
associated with chronic exposure to respirable particulates.  Health effects
have been observed at levels below current U.S. National Ambient Air Quality
Standards.  Although the biological mechanisms involved are poorly understood,
recent evidence supports the hypothesis that such air pollutants are a risk
factor for respiratory disease and cardiopulmonary mortality.  (Inhalation

RADON (CAS RN 10043-92-2) indoors is reviewed in a risk-based approach to
health protection criteria.  A WHO/EURO working group met in Israel early in
1993 to assess the significance of health risks from indoor radon, to develop
a unified approach to the control of radon exposure, and to advise on the
communication of associated health risks.  This article summarizes the

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS, pollutants ubiquitous in the environment, may disrupt

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS, pollutants ubiquitous in the environment, may disrupt
human fertility and possibly the ability to reproduce.  Both male and female
reproductive health are being disturbed by environmentally occurring chemicals
that change fertility by causing, among numerous effects, low sperm counts,
testicular abnormalities, and altered sexual development of both male and
female fetuses, as well as cancers and other diseases of both sexes.  Among
the chemicals cited as endocrine disruptors are PHTHALATES, ingredients in
various plastics, paints, inks, and varnishes; ALKYL PHENOLS, produced by
microbial degradation of detergent, paint, herbicide, and cosmetic chemicals;
and ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES, including DDT (CAS RN 50-29-3), ALDRIN CAS RN
309-00-2), and DIELDRIN (CAS RN 60-57-1).  Studies on these chemicals began
because certain wildlife, exposed to these substances, had suffered changes in
reproductive ability.  The implications for human reproduction are discussed
and reviewed.  (The Sciences, Vol. 36, No. 1, pp. 12-15, Jan.-Feb. 1996;

INDOOR AIR QUALITY POLICY OPTIONS are examined for reducing human exposures.
There are different policy approaches available for reducing human exposures
to indoor pollutants, an exceptionally complex task.  Options range from
waiting for more definitive information to enacting regulatory standards, with
many variations in between.  This article presents some of the factors
policy-makers must consider in establishing indoor air quality policies and
the role researchers should play in ensuring that such policies are based on
the best, available scientific information.  (Indoor Air 4(3), 202-211 (1994);

FOUNDRY INDUSTRY in South Africa was studied to estimate the extent of
occupational health monitoring for dust and pneumoconiosis and to assess dust
levels and the prevalence of pneumoconiosis.  In only 13 (16%) of the 82
foundries responding were regular periodic full-sized chest radiographs done.
Dust levels were measured every 3 years or more frequently in 20 foundries
(24%).  Uncontrolled dust hazard was evident in nine foundries surveyed
between 1983 and 1992.  The prevalence of silicosis ranged from 0% to 10.3%
and increased with duration of service.  The study provided convincing
evidence of neglect of occupational health by the foundry industry.  (S Afr

DOMESTIC WASTE COLLECTION was reviewed in the light of occupational health

DOMESTIC WASTE COLLECTION was reviewed in the light of occupational health
problems.  The last decade has seen a growing interest in recycling  domestic
wastes, and action plans to increase such recycling have been adopted by many
governments.  In 1975, an excess risk for chronic bronchitis was reported for
waste collectors in Switzerland and data from the Danish Registry of
Occupational Accidents and Diseases also indicate an excess risk for pulmonary
problems among waste collectors compared with the total work force.  High
incidence rates of gastrointestinal problems, irritation of the eye and skin,
and symptoms of organic dust toxic syndrome (influenza-like symptoms, cough,
muscle pains, fever, fatigue, headache) have been reported among workers
collecting the biodegradable fraction of domestic waste.  They may be exposed
to multiple agents such as dust-containing bacteria, endotoxins, mold spores,
glucans, volatile organic compounds, and diesel exhaust. (Sci Total Environ

COAL MINE DUST hydroxyl radical generation and possible implications for

COAL MINE DUST hydroxyl radical generation and possible implications for coal
workers'pneumoconiosis (CWP) are reviewed and discussed.  Occupational
exposure to coal mine dust causes CWP and other pulmonary diseases by
mechanisms that remain unclear.  Because the hydroxyl radicals (-OH) may play
an important role in the pathogenesis of CWP, the potential role of bituminous
coal mine dust samples for catalyzing the generation of -OH from hydrogen
peroxide were studied.  Based on the results, it was proposed that higher
concentrations of surface iron in coal mine dust may be involved in the
generation of increased levels of -OH radicals and may play an important role
in the development of CWP in different coal mining areas.  (Free Radical Biol
Med 18(1), 11-20 (1995); Chemical Abstracts 122:141142x, 1995)

CARBON DISULFIDE (CAS RN 75-15-0) occupational exposure mortality of Dutch

CARBON DISULFIDE (CAS RN 75-15-0) occupational exposure mortality of Dutch
workers is reviewed and discussed.  Epidemiological studies carried out in
Great Britain, Scandinavia, and the United States indicate that workers
exposed to carbon disulfide are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease
(CVD) mortality, and in particular for ischemic heart disease mortality.  The
results of the Dutch study show that exposure to relatively low levels of
carbon disulfide increases the risk of CVD mortality.  (Int Arch Occup Environ
Health 66(2), 103-110 (1994); Chemical Abstracts 122:1135655u, 1995)

MANGANESE (CAS RN 7439-96-5) TOXICITY information is available in a pamphlet,
Potter's Manganese Toxicity", a reprint of an article published in the journal
Contact. The pamphlet discussed the experiences of a raku potter who developed
Parkinson-like symptoms of manganese poisoning and metal fume fever.
Manganese fumes emitted during raku firing are more dangerous than breathing
or ingesting the dusts; symptoms are flu-like, and range from fatigue,
insomnia, confusion, forgetfulness, blackouts, vision changes, loss of
three-dimensional perception, slow reflexes, and headaches, to loss of bladder
control, motor skills, and more.  (The Crafts Report, p. 4, Jan. 1996)

ALPHA AMYLASE may be an occupational allergen in the baking industry.  In a
group of 226 bakers and pastry makers and in 88 students of a training school
for bakers, skin sensitivity to the common allergens wheat and alpha amylase
were evaluated.  Findings confirm that bakers are at risk of sensitization not
only to wheat allergen but also to amylase from Aspergillus oryzae.  The
enzyme should be included in the list of substances to be tested among bakers
in whom an occupational allergy is suspected, but particular care should be
taken in evaluating the cutaneous response.  Further investigations are also
needed to identify the source of risk and to better define the characteristics
of the enzyme and the relationship between skin reaction to amylase,
sensitization to wheat, and atopy.  In Italian.  (Med Lav 85(2), 142-148

COTTON-caused ocular and nasal irritation in workers in Lancashire cotton

COTTON-caused ocular and nasal irritation in workers in Lancashire cotton and
synthetic fiber mills was studied.  A cross-sectional study of 1048 cotton
workers and 404 synthetic fiber workers showed that work-related ocular and
nasal irritation are the most common symptoms experienced by cotton textile
workers.  There was no relation between these symptoms and atopy, byssinosis,
or dust concentration.  It is likely that they relate to as yet unidentified
agents unrelated to concentration of cotton dust.  (Occup Environ Med 51(11),
