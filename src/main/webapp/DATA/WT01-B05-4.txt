<LI>Crowd Estimates: The final day of the American Tour de Sol saw crowds turn
out in each race location. An estimated 1,300 people were on hand as vehicles
left Dover, NH for the final leg of the five day race. 
<LI>Nearly 3,000 people
greeted the winning vehicles as they crossed the finish line in downtown
Portland, ME. The crowd roared loudest as a local high school entry from
Falmouth, ME arrived.
<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course overcast, dry roads.
<LI>Special Events or Occurrences: First vehicle across the finish line was the
Solectria Sunrise, the same car that set the event range record of 238 miles
without charging in yesterday's competition. 
<LI>Of the nearly four dozen
entrants, only a few (3) were unable to reach the end of the race under their
own power. "This has been the most successful events we've ever had," said
race director Nancy Hazard. "Vehicle performance has been outstanding and the
public reaction has been overwhelming wherever we went." 
<LI>Race officials
estimate more than 45,000 people turned out to view vehicles along the race
route and at public displays along the way.
<LI>Preview of Next Day: All the competing vehicles will be on display throughout
the day in downtown Portland. Tomorrow, Saturday, vehicles will be on display
and will compete in local events as part of the Maine Solar Blast Festival.

<LI>Crowd Estimates: Morning display and start line at Minuteman Sci.-Tech. H.S.
in Lexington, MA brought out more than 1,500 people despite some early
showers. Later, in Exeter, NH a huge, cheering crowd estimated at nearly
3,000 people greeted the race teams.
<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course overcast, wet roads, challenging for
solar vehicles.
<LI>Special Events or Occurrences: Exeter is a tiny town in Southern NH (pop.
about 9,000) but nearly 3,000 people visited the midday display and starting
line. "There were so many people crowded around every vehicle, you could
hardly see any of the vehicles," said Nancy Hazard, race director. ATdS
<LI>Technical Director Dr. Rob Wills reports that special measurements are being
done as vehicles recharge. The measurements are part of an electric
utility-sponsored research program to prepare local electric companies for
increased demand for power as electric cars become more common. "The electric
companies know that electric vehicles are on the horizon," said Wills. "They
want to make sure they know how to handle them properly right from the
beginning." 
<LI>In addition to the large crowds, Exeter, NH had a bandstand and
live music. 
<LI>Race vehicles had to be carefully guided through crowds of
dancing youngsters as they began their afternoon trip to Dover, NH.
<LI>Preview of Next Day: After spending the evening in Dover, NH, nearly four
dozen race vehicles will be on display Friday morning in Dover. At 10 a.m.,
cars will race the final leg to downtown Portland, ME. After crossing the
finish line, there will be a public display at Monument Square throughout the
afternoon. Vehicles will be on display and compete in events at the Maine
Solar Blast on Saturday.

<LI>Crowd Estimates: Morning display and start line in Keene, NH brought out more
than 2,000 people.
<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course sunny, mild, optimum conditions for
all vehicles.
<LI>Special Events or Occurrences: Overall vehicle performances continue to
surprise race officials. "There is no doubt," says technical director Dr.
Robert Wills, "that the people working in electric vehicles are making great
strides each year as measured by their vehicles' performance in this event."
<LI>Hundreds of school children visited the electric and solar vehicle display in
Keene. For the first time in event history, youngsters sought autographs from
race team members. College and high school teams were especially popular with
kids. "We were amazed to see children chasing after drivers to get
autographs," said race director Nancy Hazard. "It was so exciting to see our
teams treated like celebrities. They were all surprised and pleased at the
attention." Youngsters gathered around race teams and spent nearly two  hours
asking questions about cars, batteries, solar-power and environmental issues.
<LI>Largest crowds gathered around the futuristic-looking solar-powered racing
cars.
<LI>Preview of Next Day: Thursday, displays in Lexington, MA; Exeter, NH; and
Dover, NH. Because of the number of race "legs" on Thursday, several teams
will have an opportunity to set range and distance records. Friday, nearly
four dozen vehicles are expected to cross the finish line in downtown
Portland, ME.

<H3>STANDINGS "TOP PERFORMING IN CLASS" TO DATE</H3>
This national championship road rally for electric vehicles began Monday,
May 22 in Waterbury, Conn. and ends Friday, May 26 in Portland, Maine.
Vehicles are awarded points based on "total tour miles" which are a measure
of the vehicle's performance and driving range (as measured by optional laps
driven each day). Vehicles are split into classes based on the type
(sedan/utility) and the batteries used (lead-acid/advanced). This allows
vehicles to be ranked against those of similar capability.<P>

<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Sunny and warm, dry roads.<br>

<LI>Test crews report general improvement ofvehicles overall
compared to last year's entrants.<br>
<LI> 45 vehicles left finish line at mid-day in Waterbury, CT. <br>
<LI>Three more vehicles expected to join race in progress. <br>
<LI>Vehicles will cover 300 miles (required) and may exceed 700 miles (including optional laps) by the time they reach Portland,

Force was short a crew
but a group of young women from Ethel Walker School in Connecticut stepped in
to become the 
only all-women's team competing in this year's event. This is also the first
time that an all-woman 
team has competed in the production vehicle category - reserved for vehicles
which are already 
available on the U.S. market.<p>
