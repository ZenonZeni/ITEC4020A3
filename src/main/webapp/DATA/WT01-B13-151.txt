Psychology is a key consideration to financial market and economic
analysis. In fact, psychology is a required course for undergraduate
students in economics. Consumer purchases of homes and autos rise when
households feel good about their jobs and their future. In contrast,
when consumers are uncertain, auto and home sales weaken. Psychology is
also key to business spending. Survey results on business optimism show
that firms buy more equipment and hire more workers when their
confidence is fairly high that the economy will continue to grow.
<BR><BR>

One psychological indicator, the monthly University of Michigan's
Consumer Sentiment Index, is considered a leading indicator of the
direction of the economy. When the consumer is reported to be
"cautious," for example, the economy may be headed for a slowdown. For
business sentiment, surveys by organizations such as the Conference
Board offer a reliable view of hiring plans and capital spending
intentions.
<BR><BR>

Consumer psychology, however, can be tricky. Purchasing in the United
States does not rise and fall solely with the spirits of the American
consumers. Because Americans are conditioned to watch for sales, buying
activity can often be skewed by price. 
<BR><BR>

As an example, let's consider the advertising and promotion techniques
used by auto manufacturers. For years, the U.S. auto industry sold autos
by offering rebates. What happened? Consumers caught on quickly and
started to insist on rebates before they would buy. Auto companies were
then forced to use more frequent rebates and broaden the availability of
autos sold with rebates. 
<BR><BR>

Today, the U.S. economy has a similar problem. For several years now,
the inflation rate has fallen steadily. Consumers have come to expect
it. As a result, housing markets have become dependent on prospective
home buyers waiting for a decline in mortgage rates. Across the board,
consumers will tend to postpone purchases because they expect inflation
to fall, not rise. Sales of consumer durables such as furniture, carpets
and even autos all have seen the impact of this changed consumer
psychology. How different this is from the buy-now (before prices rise
again) psychology of the 1970s!
<BR><BR>

But consumers cannot help but react to economic news. In the second half of 1995, the economy slowed down. Employment growth, in
particular, fell off. Seeing this, consumers became less confident about
their jobs - which, in turn, set off a chain reaction. Reduced
confidence in job security prompted some consumers to reduce spending.
Business optimism also turned cautious as economic weakness in Mexico
and the consumer spending slowdown reduced profit and sales
expectations. Job security, not wages, became a key focus of households.
<BR><BR>

As the country moves through this stage of the economic cycle, another
factor is influencing consumer psychology today. Consumer expectations
toward retirement also have changed, as most Americans expect that they
will have to provide more and more of their own retirement income. Less
financial support will come via Social Security benefits. To be prepared, U.S. households
have started to raise their savings rates in recent years. This change
has shifted consumer budgets toward more investment in financial assets
(for example: mutual funds, equities, bank deposits, life insurance) and
less spending on real assets (consumer goods).
<BR><BR>

Where consumer confidence goes from here depends upon employment
prospects and interest rate trends. For as long as employment growth is
positive, consumer psychology will probably remain positive but
cautious. Positive consumer sentiment should suggest continued economic
growth. The pace of growth, however, is likely to reflect Americans'
new-found caution on job security.
