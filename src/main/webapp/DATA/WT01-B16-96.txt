<H3>Worldwide Improvements in Nuclear Power Operational Safety. Andrew
Clarke.</H3>
<P> 


The paper reviews the progress made by nuclear operating countries worldwide
since 1979 towards improving safety and reliability of their power plants, and
discusses the question of accidence avoidance.<P>

Operating standards are set down by the IAEA's International Nuclear Safety
Advisory Group. Safe operation results from an interdependent combination of
quality in design, manufacture and construction, and quality of  operation. The
evolution of design, construction and safety criteria is described; remedial measures
taken on older-design reactors are referred to. Concerning the operator's role, the
evolution of cooperation is outlined: the TMI accident precipitated the formation in
the US of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators, to provide for sharing
experience. Similarly the Chernobyl accident convinced nuclear operators
worldwide of their total dependence on one another and led to the formation of the
World Association of Nuclear Operators.<P>

WANO's structure and function (to maximise safety and reliability of nuclear plants
by exchanging information and encouraging communication, comparison and
emulation amongst its members) are described, and its Peer Review programme
tabulated. Improvement in safety, however, is difficult to measure.<P>

In the US dramatic improvements in safety have been made, partly through INPO:
precursor analysis shows US nuclear power plants to be 50 to 100 times less likely
to suffer major core damage than they were in 1979; fewer less important events are
occurring too; and collective radiation exposure has been halved since 1979.<P>

In terms of general experience, evidence of improvement comes from WANO and
from many other sources including IAEA safety missions.<P>

Soviet-designed reactors (VVER440/230 and RBMKs) are mistrusted by the West,
although informed commentators consider immediate closure unnecessary. Whether
or not to operate a reactor is for national governments (under appropriate advice)
to judge, not for WANO. Soviet-designed reactors are classified in a table in three
design generations, and further tables list design improvements made to them.
Political and economic difficulties in Russia and Ukraine have hindered progress
somewhat.<P>

Operators must avoid complacency and continue to work for improvement.<P>
