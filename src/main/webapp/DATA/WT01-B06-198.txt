</H1><P ALIGN=Center>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Neither the Democratic nor the Republican tax cut or minimum














wage proposals help make the U.S. economy more competitive.  Neither
plan helps small businesses.   I am proposing a tax reform plan that makes














American companies more competitive, reduces paperwork and helps those earning














less than $30,000 per year.  It does all of these without increasing the
budget deficit.  At the same time it also provides an increase in the minimum














wage without increasing unemployment.  It may sound impossible, or even














magical--I call it "trickle up economics."</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>My proposal is quite simple:  modify the social security
tax by creating an exemption and eliminating the ceiling.  Currently, social














security taxes (FICA and medicare) are the most regressive taxes we have.
 For someone earning $15,000 per year the social security tax bite is a whopping














$2,245, half paid by the employee and half by the employer.  I propose that
the first $15,000 of income be exempt from social security and medicare taxes,














for both workers and employers.   According to the Tax Foundation (a non-profit














think tank that studies taxation issues), this exemption will cost the U.S.














treasury $40 billion, while pumping $20 billion into the hands of those needing














it most, plus another $20 billion into their employer's pockets.   </B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Social security and medicare taxes currently are imposed
only on the first $60,600 of wages.  Those earning one million dollars per
year pay no more in social security taxes than a taxpayer earning $75,000














annually.  This tax ceiling is illogical and unfair.  These taxes are not
based on benefits, they are based on the ability to pay.  And a multimillionaire














can certainly afford to pay more than a working man earning $75,000 a year.














  </B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Even Steve Forbes' flat tax did not have a ceiling.  (My














proposal is a flat tax, and if Republicans like flat taxes they should endorse














ending the ceiling on social security taxes.) By eliminating the ceiling
on wages subject to social security taxes, the Tax Foundation estimates that
we will raise $64 billion in new revenues.  This no doubt could be called
Robin Hood tax reform: taking from the rich and giving to the poor.  The
$24 billion surplus can either be retained by the treasury to reduce the
federal deficit, or it can be spread around as a benefit to those earning
less than $30,000 per year.</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>This tax reform will also end the "nanny tax" problem for
those employing child-care workers at home:  if a nanny is paid less than
$15,000 per year (and most are) she (or he) will get more take-home pay and
her employer will save money and not be required to file quarterly and annual
tax forms.</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>	In the real world, where American factories compete with
those in Mexico and Korea, this reform will make the United States much more














competitive.  Take, for example, an assembly worker paid $7.50 to put electronic














products together.  He or she now makes $15,000 in gross salary, and nets
several thousand dollars less because of taxes, including a substantial social














security tax bite of $1,122.50, nearly $100 a month.  The employee will get
an immediate raise in take-home pay.  At the same time, the employer will
save an equal amount for each employee.   With 100 employees, a tidy $100,000














will be added to the employer's bottom line.  The employer will thus improve
its profitability and be more likely to keep its plant in the United States
open for business.</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Who else will this reform benefit?  Students are often paid














under $7.50 per hour.  Restaurant workers, many in the textile industry and
in general those in semi-skilled occupations will benefit.  Those earning
more than $60,000 per year will pay more social security taxes, but even
the rich will benefit by saving taxes (and paperwork) for their nannies,
servants and chauffeurs. And if they own a business, the rich will benefit
from the new exemption.  This change will give America what it needs, a raise,
at no cost to the economy.</B>
