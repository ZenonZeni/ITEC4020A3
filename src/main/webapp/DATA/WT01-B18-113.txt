<center><B>HEALTH INFORMATION AND THE CONSUMER</B></center>
<P>
`Health Information and the Consumer' is the collected papers from a conference, of the same name, held by the OHE in November 1994, edited by Jane Griffin.
<P>
Chapters in the book cover the following:

<UL>

<LI><B>The inverse care and the targeting of GP health promotion resources</B>. Dr Peter Toon (GP, Hackney and London Implementation Group) discusses the difficulties arising from the inequalities of access to GP care highlighted by a study of the patient health checks (introduced in 1990) which was conducted in Hackney. It was found that those most in need of care were least likely to
receive it and that such generalised health promotion campaigns fail to make a significant impact on risk factors (Smoking, diet, weight, alcohol consumption) and hence on morbidity, but simultaneously have a negative effect on quality of life of those who do take part by raising their anxiety. He argues that health promotion is to a large extent `the art of the possible' and, therefore, to set a health promotion agenda on the basis of the importance of various risk factors rather than their susceptibility to change is misguided.

<LI><B>The implications of marketing medicinal products to consumers</B>. Using the example of Zovirax and its switch from being a prescription only medicine to pharmacy sale, Noel Hall (formerly of Wellcome UK) finds that there are a number of lessons to be learned for all concerned: Manufacturers who are predominantly involved with the marketing of prescription only medicines have to continually remember that when they switch a product the customer is no longer the health professional but a consumer; the Pharmacy profession should carry out a major campaign to explain their role to consumers which might in turn lead consumers to recognise the value of information provided by pharmacists; and consumers need to take greater responsibility for understanding their own health problems, to read the patient information supplied with their medicine and to know where to go to obtain further information if necessary.

<LI><B>Medicines and the role of Patient Information Leaflets.</B>Dr Sharon Gibbs (Freelance Researcher and Writer) discusses the results of her research into patients knowledge about their medicines and the impact of patient information leaflets on their level of knowledge. She also reflects on the difficulties that pharmaceutical companies face when writing patient information leaflets in ensuring that the leaflets reach their target audience whilst at the same time containing sufficient information to comply with current legislation;

<LI><B>The legal implications of the provision of health information.</B> Diana Brahams (Practising Barrister and medico-legal correspondent, The Lancet) considers the legal implications for pharmacists and general practitioners in providing health information. Both doctors and pharmacists owe their patients a duty to act with reasonable skill and care but whilst under their new contracts GPs are required to provide information to promote a healthy lifestyle there is no such requirement in contracts for community pharmacists. Using the examples of real cases, Mrs Brahams discusses the legal relationship between the consumer and both professional groups and the possible pitfalls that might occur. 

<LI><B>The role of pharmacists in the provision of health information to the consumer</B>. This chapter takes the form of four papers by Dr Philip Brown (Publisher of SCRIP World Pharmaceutical News), Linda Stone (Community Pharmacist and a Past President of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society), Derek Prentice (Consumers' Association) and Dr Felicity Smith (Lecturer in Pharmacy Practice). From their different perspectives, the authors discuss whether pharmacists have a role in providing information to consumers and if so, are they currently fulfilling this responsibility in a way which meets the consumers needs. At the conference, this subject was then opened up to the audience to continue the debate and some of the discussion is included.

<LI><B>Patient's rights - a middle class phenomenon?</B> Rabbi Julia Neuberger (Chair of Camden and Islington Community Health Services NHS Trust) suggests that if the way in which health services were analysed it would be seen that most are provided to meet the needs of the professions providing the services rather than the patients who have to use them. She argues that the rise of
the patient's right movement was to some extent a response to this situation. Whilst for a variety of historical and sociological reasons this movement started off as a middle class phenomenon it could no longer be said that it was confined to any one section of society.

<B>DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE</B>

<P>
This OHE report by Nick Marchant, published in September 1995, argued that a national screening programme for prostate cancer in men is not yet practicable.
<p>
Prostate cancer is a significant cause of illness and death amongst men. However, neither radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, the two main treatments used for early stage prostate cancer, have had any significant effect on either life expectancy or quality of life. Indeed, no clinical trial has yet demonstrated increased survival for patients as a result of treatment. Because of this, the author believes there is little point in a national screening programme being introduced.
<P>
About 10 per cent of all malignant male cancers diagnosed in the UK each year are prostate cancer - only lung cancer has a higher rate. And the figure is rising. In 1992, there were 8,735 deaths attributable to prostate cancer, more than double the 4,313 in 1974. The burden of prostate cancer falls mainly on the elderly - only 206 of the deaths in 1992 occurred in men under 60. With
the numbers of older people in the country rising, the report points out that the number of deaths caused by prostate cancer is likely to rise - perhaps to as many as 18,500 by 2031.
<P>
The booklet also deals with all other forms of prostatic disease, especially benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Symptoms include the desire to urinate during sleep, more often than normal, and pain during urination. There are about 78,000 new sufferers from BPH in the UK each year. Because symptoms build up gradually, many men accept BPH as part of the ageing process and suffer unnecessarily.
<P>
The past two decades have seen the development of a number of therapies for the treatment of BPH. Medicines and minimally-invasive therapies, as well as watchful waiting, are increasingly being regarded as realistic options to surgery. With effective treatment now available unnecessary suffering - especially in patients with milder forms of the disease - could be averted by increasing public
awareness.
<P>
<B>VALUE OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO THE UK ECONOMY</B>
<P>
The &quot;Value of the Pharmaceutical Industry to the UK Economy&quot;, published by the OHE in the summer of 1995, sets out how the UK economy benefits from having resources employed in the UK based pharmaceutical industry rather than in other industry sectors.
Wherever possible these benefits are estimated.
<P>
The overall conclusion is that the value of the pharmaceutical industry to the UK economy in 1992 was around &#163;2 billion.
<P>
<B>How does the UK economy benefit ?</B> 

<UL>

<LI>Benefits to patients - Patients receive improved and more timely medicines as a result of medicines being developed in the UK.

<LI>R&amp;D spinoffs - Other industries, the NHS and universities, are able to produce better products and services, and/or lower unit costs as a result of improvements in the science knowledge
base derived from high levels of pharmaceutical R&amp;D.

<LI>Export profits - Higher profits from exported medicines benefit the UK economy in 2 ways:

<UL>
<LI>higher net profits to UK owners;
<LI>higher corporation tax revenues to the UK Exchequer.
</UL>

<LI>Employees' Wages - Higher wages paid in the industry, compared with other sectors, benefit the economy through:

<UL>
<LI>higher net earnings by UK workers;
<LI>higher income tax revenues to the UK Exchequer.
</UL>

<LI>Competitive Advantage in the global market drives better terms of trade, helping the UK trade balance.

</UL>

<P>
<B>How were these benefits measured ?</B> 
<P>
The estimates provided assume that no research or production facilities, nor corporate headquarters of pharmaceutical companies remain in the UK. The resources &quot;freed up&quot; are assumed to be
utilised in other sectors.
<P>
The paper focuses on the long term effects which would persist even after these resources could be re-employed, and so excludes any adjustment costs of retraining personnel or obsolescence of
assets.
<P>
The estimates also exclude payments between parties inside the UK (transfers). Only income increasing the purchasing power of the UK is included. In its simplest form this is income from abroad which adds to the wealth of the UK.
<P>
<B>INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY</B> 
<P>
This book, edited by Adrian Towse, brings together the proceedings of the Symposium held by the OHE in June 1994. It examines the practice of industrial policy in relation to the pharmaceutical
industry in Europe, Japan, and the USA, and elements of policy - supporting the science base, good purchasing, and attracting inward investment.
<P>
<B>George Yarrow</B>, of Hertford College, Oxford, examining the European Commission's Industrial Policy document argues a trade-off between innovative and price competition had to be recognised.  More price competition meant less innovative competition. It is the dynamic gains, from innovation, that are the source of real gain to society, hence the need for society to place the balance
between the two in the right place.
<P>
He noted the conflict between national government pricing policies and the creation of a single market through the free movement of product. This could lead to an export of price control. Parallel
trade would push prices down to those of the lowest priced Member State. Innovation would fall.
<P>
He argued that uniform prices are not the outcome of single markets.  Prices take account of factors such as volume and other customer characteristics. The way to improve the trade-off between innovative and price competition was to allow price differentials within a single market, through more sophisticated pricing mechanisms.  If this required some competition policy exemptions then they
should be negotiated.
<P>
<B>Professor Ian Neary</B> of the Contemporary Japan Centre, University of Essex, argued that the Japanese MHW had no industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry. The fortunes of the industry
were a low priority for the MHW which had kept the pro-industrial policy MITI out of policy making. However, some of the top tier of Japanese companies would be internationally successful, in spite of lack of government sponsorship.
<P>
<B>Professor Scherer</B> of Harvard University noted that although there had been nothing in the USA that could be called an industrial policy, some Federal level policies were of significant benefit,
notably NIH spending of nearly $5bn per annum on research, and the Orphan Drug Act.
<P>
<B>Professor Trevor Jones</B>, Director-General of the ABPI noted that the UK had been a fruitful source of new pharmaceutical products because of the strong foundation of basic science upon which biomedical research is based, together with a long tradition of clinical science and practice in world renowned university hospitals, and the NHS. To maintain excellence in drug discovery and development, the UK needed policies to retain a strong science and medical base. This had to be matched with adequate funding, not only of research grants but of the fabric of university and institute
laboratories, many of which now showed marked signs of deterioration.  The restructuring of the Research Councils and the Technology Foresight exercise provided new impetus for further investment in biomedical R&amp;D. It would be important that it was not diluted in the competition for funds, and that building on strengths was a feature of allocation.
<P>
<B>Professor Henry Grabowski</B> of Duke University set out evidence from his work on the costs of R&amp;D and the returns or profitability of NCEs coming to market, commenting on the implications for policy makers wanting to use price control to keep purchasing costs down.
<P>
His 1991 study with DiMasi, Hansen, and Lasagna, produced a best estimate of $231m (in 1987 dollar) and 12 years to discover and develop a new drug. But whereas R&amp;D investment costs have been increasing further since then, product life cycles have been getting shorter as a result of faster follow-on from competing drugs, and increased generic competition when patents expire.
<P>
In his most recent study with Vernon, he found large variations in returns across NCEs. Whilst the top ten per cent of products earn more than five times the capitalised value of average R&amp;D
costs, only the top 30 per cent cover average R&amp;D costs (see Figure). The remaining 70 per cent will not typically cover any of the common discovery costs or the costs of failures. Hence blockbuster drugs motivate the R&amp;D process. As healthcare costs escalate, there is a risk that all countries will try to obtain the most innovative new pharmaceuticals at breakeven prices and try to leave the payments for drug R&amp;D to other countries.  Left unchecked, these developments could result in a drastic curtailment of global R&amp;D investment for new medicines, despite the exciting potential for scientific advances that now exist.
<P>
<B>Jeremy Holmes</B>, Managing Director of EAG, and Professor John Dunning looking at factors influencing the location of multinational investment decisions in the pharmaceutical industry. Of the four factors that influenced R&amp;D location, resource factors were most important for European firms, followed by market factors, drug and general regulatory factors. For US firms, market factors
were more important than resource factors. The most important resource factor for R&amp;D investment was the quality of a country's tertiary education system. It was difficult to overstate the importance f government policies in developing and upgrading the human capital base. Governments seeking to attract R&amp;D had to adopt &quot;holistic&quot; policies towards industrial competitiveness that recognised the links between policy on education, technology, industry tax and
employment.

<B>Handling Uncertainty in the Results of Economic Evaluation</B>

<P>
This Briefing, by Andrew Briggs of Brunel University HERG, discusses how sensitivity analysis and other techniques for handling uncertainty can be used to give decision makers confidence in the robustness (or otherwise) of the results of an health economic evaluation of a medicine or other treatment.
<P>
He identifies four types of uncertainty, relating to: the data requirements of the study; the extrapolation of data or end points; the generalisability of results; and the choice of analytic method.
Although the use of statistical analysis to represent uncertainty is usual in clinical evaluation, it is not yet the method of choice for economic evaluations. The Briefing discusses four main types of sensitivity analysis (simple sensitivity analysis, extreme sensitivity analysis, threshold analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis) and sets out guidelines for the choice of and presentation of sensitivity analysis.
<P>
<B>THE ECONOMICS OF HEALTH CARE</B> 
<P>
A booklet designed to help teachers and students apply economics to health care and to the challenges facing Britain's National Health Service has been distributed free to all secondary schools and colleges with A-level or equivalent courses in economics.  Additional copies have been supplied at a price of &#163;1. To date more than 6500 copies have been sent out.
<P>
The booklet, produced by the Office of Health Economics (OHE) and sponsored by the charities committee of Glaxo Wellcome, is entitled &quot;The Economics of Health Care&quot;. It supports
the new A-level syllabuses which place particular emphasis on the application of basic economic techniques to particular sectors of the economy.
<P>
The 50-page booklet comprises five units which examine: The problem of health care; How a free market approach to health care would work; The case against a free market; Health care in the UK; Some further questions.
<P>
As well as text, pictures and graph, the booklet contains activity boxes - suggesting related and follow-up projects which could be undertaken - as well as posing questions for the student to
consider. It comes with a full set of teachers' notes.  
<P>
<B>Hypothecated Health Taxes - An evaluation of recent proposals</B>
<P>
This report, by Andrew Jones and Alan Duncan of the University of York, examines the arguments put forward for the special tax which, its advocates claim, could increase the money available to the NHS while reducing political interference. Such ideas have been put forward for discussion by organisations including the Institute of Economic Affairs, the British Medical Association and the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The report notes that in 1993-94, &#163;36 billion was spent on the NHS - about &#163;630 per head or &#163;1,500 per income tax payer. This would be equivalent to a &quot;health tax&quot; rate of 16p in the pound, cutting the present general income tax rate from 25p to 9p.
<P>
The criteria outlined in the report against which the proposed tax is measured are: efficiency; equity; stable but growing revenue base; transparency; responsiveness; flexibility; autonomy and accountability. The main challenge is to create a genuine link between the separate tax and the NHS expenditure, the report concludes.  Creating a separate NHS fund would help, but governments might
try to shift other expenditure on to the NHS so the fund would pay for that, too. Supporters of the earmarking would also need to set out the political mechanism by which the annual tax rate
would be set. These two issues will be examined in a future OHE report by the authors.
<P>
<B>Health Care As A Handicraft Industry</B>
<P>
The second annual OHE lecture was given by one of the worlds leading economists, Professor W J Baumol. In the lecture publication he states that Britain can and should spend more on the NHS.
<P>
He says that &quot;a major source of the health care cost disease can be traced to the differences in the productivity growth rates of the various parts of the typical developed economy. It is hardly
surprising that, while overall productivity in the industrial world has been growing rapidly, the pace of growth in different sectors has varied substantially.&quot;
<P>
He argues that health care is a &quot;handicraft&quot; industry. It &quot;cannot be fully automated and liberated from the requirement of a substantial residue of personal skill and attention&quot;.
There has been some rise in productivity but over longer periods it has been, and will be, far slower than the rate of productivity increase of the economy as a whole. That is why the share of GDP
devoted to health care will rise, irrespective of the impact of the aging of the population.
<P>
Professor Baumol argues that straight forward arithmetic suggests that over the next 50 years medical outlays may more than double their share of GDP. In the US health care expenditure could rise
from 12 per cent of GDP to 35 per cent. The UK currently spends 6.8 per cent of its GDP on health, a doubling would increase it to 14 per cent of GDP.
<P>
This may mean tax increases are necessary to pay for increases in NHS spending over time. It is a fiscal illusion that underlies the view that consumers as a group cannot afford to pay the rising
costs of health care. Economic growth means that we can afford more of everything - private and public consumption. However if taxes do not rise, the choice is to design a privately financed
ystem that provides high quality universal coverage, (he sets out eight goals to be achieved in such a design), or to allow a publicly funded service to be steadily eroded.
<P>
<B>Financing Health Care in the UK: A Discussion of NERA's
Prototype Model to Replace the NHS</B> 
<P>
This report, edited by Adrian Towse, is the result 0f an OHE symposium held in 1993 to discuss a major report Financing Health Care by the specialist economics consultancy NERA which included a prototype model for health care reform, which, in the UK, woud replace the NHS with a guaranteed health care package available to all, funded by compulsory income based contributions to a central insurance fund, with consumers then choosing which private insurer to use (the private insurer would be given a fixed sum by the central insurance fund), paying extra for services outside the guaranteed
health care package.
<P>
Professor A J Culyer argues that proposals to replace the NHS are fundamentally flawed. One of the UK's leading health economists, he argues that a private sector insurance scheme will raise administration costs, restrict access to services for those with chronic illnesses or low incomes, and is &quot;frankly naive about the workings of competitive insurance.&quot;
<P>
The NERA proposals are supported by William Laing in his contribution to the publication. He argues that consumers can exercise choice in health care, and that competition to provide a guaranteed health
care package will generate enormous improvements in the quality and efficiency of health care in the UK. He concludes that it is &quot;quite possible to imagine the ideas [the proposals] being part of the mainstream health policy debate in the UK in 5 to 10 years time ... the greatest attraction of the NERA proposals is the possibility that regulated competition might stimulate the emergence of radically new and more efficient health care delivery systems as part of the &quot;discovery&quot; process associated with competitive markets.&quot;

<B>STIMULATING R&amp;D INTO NEW MEDICINES FOR LESS DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES</B> 
<P>
In December 1994 the OHE co-hosted a discussion meeting entitled &quot;Stimulating R&amp;D into new medicines for Less Developed Countries&quot;. This highly productive meeting was a joint venture with a Working Party of the WHO Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research Relating to Future Intervention Options headed by Prof. R. Feachem, now of the World Bank. The central aim of the meeting was to bring together a group individuals with industry backgrounds, along with appropriate academics and public policy makers to identify any barriers which were perceived to exist to the expeditious development of many new medicines needed in the poorer nations of the world.
<P>
The discussions raised a number of interesting points, including the following:

<UL>

<LI>Intellectual property protection may still be insufficient in many developing countries because of delayed implementation of GATT / TRIPS arrangements.

<LI>Effective demand in developing countries may be too low to generate a positive return on investment in which case subsidies of some form are likely to be necessary from the developed world.

<LI>Orphan Drug legislation could be used as a model on which to base intervention.

<LI>There may be a role for an international purchasing agency, set up and funded, partly, by developed countries

<LI>Companies already receive assistance with the set up and conduct of clinical trials in developing country environments.

<LI>The pattern of disease is changing and there will be greater convergence between developing and developing countries.

</UL>

<P>
These issues and others relating to the problem, in particular the potential role for Orphan Drug type legislation, are addressed in detail in a forthcoming OHE publication.

<P>
<B>DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS AND PULMONARY EMBOLISM</B> 
<P>
In a report by Jane Griffin which looked at the problems caused by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism it was noted that approximately 10 per cent of all hospital deaths were due to pulmonary embolism (most fatal emboli arise from a deep vein thrombosis in the lower limb). DVT is preventable, and the report highlights the point that the most efficient way to prevent both fatal and
non-fatal thromboembolism is to use routine prophylaxis for moderate to high risk hospital patients. The report argues that not only would this course of action save lives but would also be cost-effective
in preventing non-fatal symptomatic thromboembolism, which requires investigation and treatment. The report questions why, in the light of all the supporting evidence, effective routine prophylaxis
is still not being used routinely.

<P>
Copies of the report will be available from late spring/summer 1996

<center><B>PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HEALTH ECONOMICS GROUP</B></center>
<P>
The PIHEG met on September 19th to discuss &quot;Delivering Health Economics Information to NHS Decision Takers&quot;
<P>
<b> Professor John Gabbay</b>, Wessex Institute of Public Health, spoke from an NHS perspective on the use of cost-effectiveness evidence. He explained that with health-care spending increasing in every developed country the need for cost-effectiveness based evidence for clinical decision-making was becoming greater. Professor Gabbay focused upon the local initiative in which he is involved at the Wessex Institute of Public Health. This consists of a series of rapid research reviews, taking 2-3 months to complete, detailing various health technologies, each aimed at achieving an approximate
90% accuracy level. Each report is used to inform Wessex's Development Evaluation Committee about which health technologies to recommend to Health Commissions and Trusts in the Wessex region for use in contract setting. Health technologies are recommended for adoption or non-adoption on the basis of cost utility and the strength of evidence on which the cost utility was calculated.
<P>
Derek Smith, Chief Executive of Kings College Hospital, discussed his reasons for being sceptical over the role of health economics in NHS decision making. He viewed the absence of structures to
enable rigorous economic review as particularly significant. A variety of factors were cited as responsible for this situation:

<UL>

<LI>independence traditionally sought by NHS consultants
<LI>focus of purchasing in single year boxes
<LI>limited numbers of public health doctors
<LI>poor information and information flows
<LI>pressure to rationalise is not as strong in UK as in the US despite purchaser/provider split

</UL>

<P>
Despite the problems highlighted Derek Smith believes the changing health environment is likely to force change as a result of pressures on policy makers (ageing population/higher utilisation rates/diminishing government revenues/rising public expectations) and the system growing. Health economics seems sure to become a necessary and integral part of decision making.
<P>
Adrian Towse presented the results of a University of York survey of 90 GPs, &quot;Will GPs use evidence on cost-effectiveness&quot;.  The survey dealt with the need to identify and understand the
factors which determine whether or not an economic evaluation will impact upon a target audience. The target audience investigated in this case was GPs, both fundholders (FHGPs) and non-fundholders (NFHGPs). Results from the study indicated that the credibility that GPs attach to a study is dependent upon certain key criteria:

<UL>

<LI>SPONSOR - Industry sponsored studies have low credibility amongst GPs, whereas GP funded studies through BMA/RCGP have most credibility.
<LI>DECISION-MAKER INVOLVEMENT - A large increase in credibility would result with GP involvement. FHGPs rated this as more important than NFHGPs.
<LI>STUDY INVESTIGATOR - University Research Centres are seen as the most appropriate investigators and Patient Support Groups as the least appropriate.
<LI>MEDIUM OF DISSEMINATION - GPs rely heavily on journal reputation, with the Medical Journal / BMJ / Lancet carrying most credibility. Drug company mailings and drug representative visits carry the least.
<LI>METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY - Credibility increases if studies comply with an acceptable methodological framework.

</UL>

<P>
The survey suggests that economic evaluations will have an impact upon GPs, even when only modest economic consequences are identified. GPs appear to be a receptive and positive audience with a reasonable level of understanding. A lesson from the survey is that the impact of an economic evaluation can be maximised by tailoring the structure and dissemination of the study to the particular requirements and comprehension level of the target audience.

<center><B>1996 OHE ANNUAL LECTURE</B></center>
<P>
<I><B>David Sackett calls for Evidence-Based Medicine and Cost-Utility to Ration Care in the NHS</B></I> 
<P>
The 1996 Annual lecture was given by Professor David Sackett of the University of Oxford and the NHS R&amp;D Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, on February 13 at the Royal College of Physicians. The title of Professor Sackett's presentation was &quot;Evidence-Based Medicine, Cost Utility and the Physician &quot;. He discussed from a physician's point of view, the relationship between economics, with its concepts of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility, evidence -based medicine and the care of individual patients. The lecture was attended by approximately 250 people. A paper based on the presentation will be published later this year as part of the OHE Annual Lecture monograph series.
<P>
Professor David Sackett is the Director of the NHS R&amp;D Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and Chair in Clinical Epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Medicines, University of Oxford.
Prior to moving, to Oxford, in 1994, he worked at McMaster University in Canada, where he founded the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and served in turn, as Hospital Physician-in-Chief and University Head of the Division of Internal Medicine.

Professor Sackett began by defining &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot; as &quot;the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients&quot;.
<P>
The practice of evidence-based medicine requires the fusion of two different sorts of things. The first, the individual clinical expertise that gets better and better; second the best available external clinical evidence, access to which becomes worse and worse. By individual expertise we mean the increasing proficiency and judgement that individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice.
<P>
It is not &quot;cook-book medicine&quot;. External guidelines have to be integrated with individual clinical expertise in deciding whether and how it matches the patient's clinical state, predicament
and preferences, and thus whether it should be applied. 

<P>
<I><B>E-BM is not Cost Cutting</B></I> 
<P>
Evidence-based medicine is not cost-cutting medicine. There is afoot in many of the health professions a concern that evidence-based medicine will be hi-jacked by purchasers and managers, merely to cut the cost of health care for individual patients. This of course is a misunderstanding of what EBM is about because, if indeed it is directed toward the benefit of individual patients,
evidence-based medicine identifies and applies the most efficacious interventions to maximise their function, quantity and quality of life, and may raise rather than lower the cost of their care.
<P>
There is also a myth that most medicine is not evidence-based and huge savings can be made by cutting out this care, not to mention avoiding harm to patients. In one month we admitted 121
patients; we diagnosed 109; and discovered that the pundits had it upside down: that evidence-based care was provided to 82 per cent of our patients - slightly more than half on the basis of randomised trials, another third on the basis of convincing non-experimental evidence, and only about 18 per cent without substantial evidence.
<P>
<I><B>Tackling Conflicts</B></I> 
<P>
Conflicts that exist arise because I am striving to offer and provide manoeuvres that maximise my patient's utility. But in doing so I run the risk of using resources that ought to be going to optimising the mean cost utility to society. The opportunity cost of serving my patient's need may be to dis-serve some other patient's needs in a broader social context. The issue again is one of having to recognise that and sort out how to minimise it and what to do about it.
<P>
Individual clinicians comply with restrictions on access when they are judged to be valid for the patient in question and judged to be ethical in their construction. This requires disclosure to patients that &quot;yes, indeed, there is a manoeuvre&quot; and &quot;yes, on average it would improve your quality of life&quot; but that, given the rationing which has arguably existed ever since the first shaman found the first skull back in Palaeolithic times, a decision has been made by the health care system, by the public, by society, to restrict this; that that would be disclosed and, again, an offer made to link them to some other source. This would apply to manoeuvres which, although they would maximise my patient's utility, would conflict with distributive justice, and that I am a willing party to that group decision.
<P>
How can we minimise these areas of conflict? First, we can go after, and generate if we do not have it, more valid evidence to identify the ineffective manoeuvres now in use. The governmental papers suggest that perhaps 5 per cent of the &#163;20 million which was being spent in surgical services might be unnecessary.  Stopping that sort of activity frees up those resources for reallocation, more benefits both to the group and the individual patient, minimising the impacts of those differing points of view - minimising the conflict by increasing public confidence in an evidence-based and just health system.
<P>
With more and more valid cost utility information for use in policy-making, to identify the marginal cost per unit of health gain for the other manoeuvres, society can then decide whether to ration in an ordered fashion and draw a line or, through some other consensus development method, sort out which resources should or should not be made available.

<center><B>Primary Care led purchasing in the NHS: Fundholding and other models</B></center>
<P>
<B>PROFESSOR C HAM</B>, Director, Health Services Management Centre, University of Birmingham 
<P>
In recent years there has been a shift of power within the Health Service. We have seen purchasers refocusing their activities, from the management of health care institutions and hospitals to thinking about the population, its health needs and how best they can use their resources to respond to those needs. In addition, dialogue has opened between health authorities and general practitioners,
combining a public health agenda with an interest in primary care.  A consequence of this shift in the balance of power has been to put specialists and secondary care providers in a more accountable
position, and to give purchasers, including GP fundholders, a greater capacity to exert leverage over how services are delivered This policy has been reinforced with recent measures to develop a primary care-led NHS.
<P>
There are two key components in this policy. One is the extension of fundholding; with three new options on the table, including &quot;total purchasing&quot; for a number of practices. The second
is the move to integrate district health authorities and Family Health Services Authorities in England and Wales from April 1996, bringing these two countries into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland where integration has existed for some time. These integrated authorities, will be expected to give priority to primary care, strengthening primary care provision and ensuring that all GPs,
not just fundholders, have influence over planning, purchasing and the commissioning of health care.
<P>
Starting with the two original models of purchasing: the population-centred approach, focused on the work of health authorities, and the more patient-oriented fundholding, what we have seen in practice is the rapid development of a range of mixed or hybrid models.
<P>
Fundholding has gone off into different directions with community fundholding, total purchasing, and the spontaneous emergence of multi-funds, with a new association which has been set up to bring
together the work of those multi-funds.
<P>
Starting from the population-centred model, we see health authorities developing a range of locality-based approaches to commissioning, trying to devolve and de-centralise their decision-making. We
see interest in practice-sensitive purchasing as health authorities try to get alongside individual practices, often developing notional budgets in the process. More strategically, we see the development of joint commissioning between health authorities and their local authority partners. This innovation and experimentation has not been driven from the centre but has evolved from the bottom up.  Managers, doctors and others have taken the opportunity to see how far they can test out these different approaches.
<P>
What does the evidence, such as it is, tell us about the likely effectiveness of these alternative purchasing models?
<P>
<B>The Effectiveness of Fundholding</B> 
<P>
Fundholding has had a number of effects. The UK experience certainly suggests that if you change the incentive structure facing primary care physicians they will change their clinical practices, not on the basis of good research evidence but because the way in which they are paid has changed. This is an important conclusion to draw, not just from fundholding but also from the 1990 GP contract and the impact that this had on health promotion, prevention work and other aspects of GPs' clinical activity.
<P>
What fundholding has done in particular is:

<OL>
<LI>Change in prescribing behaviour, producing more cost-effective prescribing, and increasing the use of generic drugs. GPs in fundholding practices have consequently often made savings in their drugs budgets.
<LI>Reduce waiting times for hospital appointments, both outpatient and inpatient, for the patients registered with fundholding practices. There has also been improved communication between general practitioners and their specialist colleagues. For example, improved discharge information getting back more quickly to GPs - a common complaint over many years.
<LI>Increase the range of services being delivered within primary care. Often the savings GPs have made, in prescribing budgets, for example, are redeployed to pay counsellors, physiotherapists,
and dieticians, to deliver care in the practice rather than referring patients to hospital to receive those services.
</OL>

<P>
Equally important, it should be acknowledged that the adverse effects of fundholding that I and many other people predicted do not seem to have materialised so far.

<OL>
<LI>The main danger anticipated was that fundholding would create an incentive for GPs to select patients. This does not appear to have happened, although the absence of research does not help
us make that judgement. The reason that risk selection has not materialised is that despite the intention in <I>Working for Patients</I> to establish budgets on a capitation basis, they have been set
on an historical basis, looking at what GPs have done in the past and therefore they have been relatively generous without creating a strong incentive to introduce risk selection.
<LI>The literature indicates that management and transaction costs appear to be relatively high in relation to fundholding, as compared with other models of purchasing. This is not just because of the
management allowances paid to fundholders, but more especially because of the additional workload for the NHS trusts in having to negotiate tailor-made contracts with a large number of small
purchasers.
<LI>The survey evidence appears to suggest that one of the main complaints GPs have about fundholding is the workload. This is unsurprising, given that taking on a budget will involve additional responsibilities. How long that can be sustained is an important question which needs to be addressed.
</OL>

<P>
The achievements of fundholders which I have mentioned have been thrown into sharper relief, by the fact that on the whole health authorities, following the population-centred purchasing model,were much slower to develop their role as purchasers. One reason for that is they were not encouraged to be very entrepreneurial in the early days. The emphasis was on steady state; the political line was to progress rather slowly.
<P>
Over time their impact has increased. They are now working with GPs in localities and through all sorts of other mechanisms. In the process, they are re-focusing their attention away from simply
the management of health care services to the public health agenda set out in <I>The Health of the Nation</I>. The emphasis is now on evidence-based medicine, ensuring cost-effectiveness in the
use of resources, and also the policy of a primary care-led NHS. 
<P>
The innovation we have seen in primary care has not been confined to GP fundholding. We are also seeing some very important developments in primary care provision and commissioning in non-fundholding practices. For example, the Lyme Community Care Unit in Dorset is achieving many of the same benefits that fundholding has done without actually going down that route.
<P>
<B>Assessing Models of Purchasing</B> 
<P>
What sense can we make of all of this, given incomplete evidence, a rapidly moving picture, and differential developments of the alternative models? We need to find a way of combining population
centred and patient-focused purchasing. The simple question who is the better purchaser, the health authority or the fundholder, is the wrong question to ask. The evidence suggests that health authorities are better at some aspects of purchasing, assessing community health care needs and working strategically with their partners in local authorities and in the voluntary sector. Equally,
GPs in fundholding and, to some extent, in non-fundholding practices are better at other aspects of purchasing. They are much closer to their patients. They have more direct experience of the quality
of care. They can respond to demands in a way which it will always be difficult to do for those who staff health authorities. The challenge is to combine the leverage of health authorities and the bite of fundholders to see if we can get the best of both of these different models of purchasing.
<P>
There is no guarantee that the sum of multiple purchasing decisions will add up to an appropriate pattern of service provision for people who are living in a given health district. Indeed, putting
it more forcibly and more bluntly, if we do not co-ordinate and synchronise purchasing decisions by health authorities on the one hand and fundholders on the other there is a real risk of instability and fragmentation. The ability to ensure good local access to comprehensive services will no longer be there because there is not the capacity in the service to plan and co-ordinate in the way we have become accustomed over the last 45 to 50 years.  So there needs to be &quot;synchronised purchasing&quot; in the new NHS. How that is to be achieved has never really been specified.
<P>
Turning to the future, fundholding is now seen as the preferred option for GPs but not the only option. There has been a shift in policy. It is quite likely, that fundholding will expand to cover perhaps 50 per cent of the population in England by next year, and maybe 60 per cent beyond that. It will be difficult to get beyond the 60 per cent figure because some GPs remain opposed to fundholding. Other options will therefore be needed.
<P>
Let us also recognise that, as the financial constraints in the health service tighten we may find not only further practices going into the scheme, but also some exits from fundholding. If the Government is serious about moving away from the current budget-setting method towards the capitation approach to fundholding, then over time that could mean some significant shifts for individual practices - both up and down. Under that system, the financial attractions to the losers of remaining as fundholders will diminish. It would also not be at all surprising if some practices felt that they had achieved what they wanted in two or three years of fundholding and decided to leave the scheme after that; especially if health authorities become better purchasers and they become more sensitive to GPs. The relative advantage of the different models may then change.
<P>
Despite the support and the momentum behind fundholding, it is probable that health authorities will continue to have an important role themselves as the direct purchasers. Whilst, they will also take on the more strategic, enabling role that has been prescribed for them, we are a long way from the position where health authorities will give up holding a budget and buying some services directly
for the populations they serve.
<P>
At the present time the proportion of the hospital and community health services' budget controlled by fundholders, and the proportion of the population covered by fundholders is relatively small compared
with the vast amount of resources still under the control of health authorities. The question is how will that change and how rapidly.  Speculating about two years down the track it might look something
like Figure 2. Total purchasers are in the left-hand column, GPs buying all services for their patients, covering perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of the population in England. Standard fundholding will expand because of the extensions to the services that GPs are purchasing, and we know that more practices will come in. Then we have the community fund holding option right at the end.  This is clearly not a precise scientific prediction. However, it does suggest that there will still be a considerable amount
of resources under the control of health authorities as direct purchasers. So for some time to come there will continue to be a role for health authorities, even with the current emphasis placed on the expansion and the development of GP fundholding.
<P>
What about a change of Government? Let me be bold here and suggest that it may not make that much difference. First of all, I do not think fundholding will be abolished overnight. If you are
a future Labour Secretary of State, it is unlikely that you would wish to antagonise a large number of GPs with a unilateral decision to get rid of fundholding. It is more likely that the policy will be geared towards encouraging GPs to leave fundholding of their own freewill and to participate in alternative GP commissioning models.
<P>
There would seem to be increasing convergence between the political parties. Labour's GP-commissioning model does not appear to be that different from the current policy, ie a primary care-led NHS. GPs who are already commissioning, under the umbrella of an integrated health authority seem to be operating in a way which would be rather similar to how they would function if there was
a change of Government in the next two years. The Labour Party has shifted its thinking. It is prepared to be discriminating in its response to present policies.
<P>
To summarise and conclude, what I am suggesting here is a convergence taking place; that there are some outstanding differences, but if you cut behind the smoke-screen of the political debate you
discover quite a lot of common ground now emerging, as both political parties begin perhaps to move towards a new consensus. There are some key challenges, however, which emerge whatever the political future may hold.

<OL>
<LI>There is a need to strengthen management capacity still further in primary care,. If we are expecting even more to happen in a primary care-led NHS, not only commissioning but also service
delivery and service provision, this will require a further investment in the management skills of all primary care staff, not just Gps.  We will have to find the resources to make that happen.
<LI>There is a serious problem of morale and motivation amongst GPs. We need to recognise this and find some ingenious ways of addressing this issue
<LI>There is a challenge for the new health authorities. The history and tradition of district health authorities has, until very recently, been in relation to secondary care and specialist services. There
is a risk that the Family Health Services Authority contribution will be swamped as the new appointments are made and as the new health authorities are established. We must avoid that and we
must ensure that there is a genuine primary care focus, not only in what health authorities say and in the plans they produce but in how they allocate resources.
</OL>

<P>
If we can meet these challenges then the idea of a primary care-led NHS will become a reality. If we cannot, then it is simply another of those nice phrases which we should dispose of in the dustbin
of political rhetoric.

<center><B>The Future of Primary Care</B></center>
<P>
<B>PROFESSOR MARTIN ROLAND</B> 
<P>
Director, National Primary Care Research and Development Centre, University of Manchester
<P>
General practice is the dominant discipline within UK primary care. The majority of primary care is delivered by general practice-based teams. Indeed, the role of general practice as the core primary
care discipline has been strengthened by the 1991 reforms, which have increasingly given purchasing power to GPs. In this article I comment on the future of general practice as the core primary care discipline, discussing two threats which are currently facing the generalist - from fragmentation within general practice itself and from the growing body of specialists working from within the
community. I discuss the challenge to general practice to define and assure the quality of care offered, and how finally set out a vision for the future of primary care in the UK.
<P>
<B>Risk of Fragmentation</B> 
<P>
The threat that primary care will become fragmented, making it more difficult to provide care of high quality relates to three current issues.

<OL>
<LI>How important is 24-hour responsibility to general practice?  Those with a pessimistic view of the future regard a separate night-time contract as the start of an inexorable chipping away at general practice, which will leave it unrecognisable as a distinct discipline. I do not share these fears. The experience of one comparable health care system, Denmark, is that splitting the out-of-hours contract from the day-time contract has proved a success. Personal continuity of the 5 per cent of care which occurs out of hours is not necessary for a high-quality primary health care service.
<LI>Defining a core of general practitioner services. The General Medical Services Committee of the BMA has this year produced a consultation document defining these. Although there may be a need to define the core of general practice, there is also a danger. We may lose sight of the fact that a large part of the case for the generalist is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. A definition of a core range of services may expose general practice to precisely the threats from which it is intended to protect it.
<LI>There are pressures for purchasers to look at sections of
general practice care and towards specific service contracts,
i.e. contracting from general practice. These are clearly going
to be a feature of primary care in the future.
</OL>

<P>
We should not be fearful of these developments. They mark the end of an era where general practice is an amorphous blob of care in which quality can be neither assessed nor assured. Back in 1983, the RCGP policy statement on quality said that each general practitioner should be able to say what services his practice provides for his patients, and each general practitioner should &quot;define specific objectives for the care of his patients and should monitor the extent to which these objectives are met.&quot;
<P>
Such service standards are not easy to set or to meet, but a profession which can lead with this sort of approach to the provision of care should have nothing to fear from contracts which define objectives
to be delivered for particular patient groups. If we are thinking about defining a core of general practice and thinking about contracting for elements of general practitioner care, one additional argument which needs to come into the discussion is whether the independent contractor status has outlived its value. An increasing number of younger GPs appear to be interested in a salaried service.
This is an issue which needs debate.
<P>

<B>Risk of Specialisation</B> 
<P>
A second possible threat to generalist care, is the risk of specialisation. I want to talk both about the risks of specialisation within general practice and the growth in community-based specialist care.
<P>
1) Specialisation within general practice comes in two forms.
<P>
a) The first is the employment of health professionals within the primary care team to carry out specific specialised tasks. The most obvious example here is the growth of the practice nurse.
Much has been written about this, especially on the other side of the Atlantic. Estimates range from 4 per cent to 85 per cent as the proportion of the generalist's work which could be done by nurses. I do not wish to defend the methodology of these studies, but there is at least the basis for a debate.
<P>
Indeed, in the UK many of the achievements within general practice in the past 10 years have been related to developments in practice nursing.
<P>
The last two practices that I worked in practice nurses trained as specialists in asthma and diabetes. I did not find my role as a general practitioner threatened. Indeed, I think that the greater threat to primary care comes from those who believe generalism means that the GP must be all things to all people.
<P>
b) The second form of specialisation within general practice, is the extent to which GPs themselves should become specialised within practices. This is an area where there has been very little public or professional debate. The fear within general practice is that once GPs start to become specialised this will mean the start of an inexorable slide, where the benefits of generalist care may be lost. The most obvious and perhaps least threatening areas for specialisation are those where particular technical
skills are required. So, for example, the capacity of a group practice to provide high-quality care may be enhanced if only one or two partners can use a slip lamp, insert an IUCD or carry out minor surgery. This is a crucial debate for the profession to have, and it will be particularly important to evaluate innovative models of practice.
<P>
2) I now want to discuss the possible threat from the growth in community-based specialist care.
<P>
An RCGP discussion paper describes a core general practice team of doctors, nurses and managers, sometimes including district nurses and health visitors. But what is the role of the other health professionals who are increasingly based in the community?
<P>
I believe the ever-increasing capacity for sub-specialist care to deliver effective interventions in community settings is one of the strongest reasons to protect the role of the generalist. Theodore Fox put it well over 30 years ago, saying:
<P>
&quot;<I>The more complex medicine becomes, the stronger the reasons why everyone should have a personal doctor who will take continuous responsibility for him, protecting him from the zealous specialist</I>.&quot;
<P>
The plethora of community-based specialists requires the coordinating function of a small core primary health care team. That, within the UK context, is the general practice-based team. What is unclear, however, is which of the other professional groups should provide direct access to patients. Few would argue that patients should not have direct access to dentists and pharmacists. However, it
is right, within the UK context, that access to community-based medical specialists continue to be by referral from GPs. Of course there are blurred edges. How should a specialist paediatric asthma clinic run by specialist asthma nurses interface with general practice? There are unresolved issues which need debate.
<P>
I now want to go on to discuss two challenges relating to the need to define and assure the quality of care offered
<P>

<B>The Need to Define Quality</B> 
<P>
There are a wide range of dimensions of quality. In relation to 20th century primary health care I would like to suggest six. 

<OL>
<LI>Access. One of the major strengths of the UK health care system is the fact that almost the entire population is registered with a general practitioner. In the move towards market orientation in the health service, it is extremely important that we guard against erosion of this principle, ensuring for example that fund-holding arrangements do not impair access to care for difficult or expensive
patients. A second element to access is ensuring you actually get to see the doctor.
<LI>Equity. On the whole, the NHS does not have a bad record of at least trying to distribute resources to where they are needed. One of the least attractive aspects of fund-holding has been that
it has led in some cases to a two-tier service. Sometimes this may result in an overall improvement in service, but we need to ensure that equity remains a fundamental principle in planning our health service.
<LI>Clinical care and performance. If there are threats to primary care disciplines from encroaching specialists, then primary care professionals need to be able to demonstrate that they have better
diagnostic skills, especially for undifferentiated, ill-structured problems, better management skills, especially for minor and moderately serious conditions and those with important psychosocial components, and provide better preventive care. Much time is spent thinking about the interface between primary and secondary care and the role of GPs in purchasing secondary care. It is very important that we do not neglect the core aspects of clinical care within general practice itself. Much is written about the role of the GP as gatekeeper, but we must not forget that the main job of the general practitioner is to look after his garden and not just to mind the gate. In looking at the quality of clinical care, we must not neglect important dimensions of quality because they are hard to measure. Haigh, Smith and Armstrong carried out work on large groups of patients, trying to identify the elements of quality which patients felt to be important. Top of the list was &quot;a doctor who listens&quot;. This ties in with concepts developed within general practice over the past 30 years that it is the quality of the individual consultation which is a key element of quality of care. An increasing amount of work from groups at St Thomas's, from John Howie's group in Edinburgh, shows that time is an essential element to quality of care. Good clinical care cannot be delivered in five minutes per patient. We must not forget that the quality of the individual clinical encounter is at the heart of medicine, and that primary care must be structured to allow sufficient time for the consultation. General practice must not choose performance indicators which are easily measured but ignore those which are key to good medical practice.
<LI>The range of services provided. There is a generally shared view that it would be desirable for a wide range of services to be provided cost-effectively from a base which is fairly close to the patient's home.
<LI>Anticipatory care. This is a weak link in primary care at present. Stott and Davies identify continuing care as one of the potential parts of all primary care consultations. The service is very demand-led, however, and practices are often not all that good at planning long-term care of chronic disease. Diabetes is perhaps the example to show that it can be done. Tudor-Hart wrote in 1983 that &quot;<I>Organised personal responsibility is the key to improved outcome</I>&quot;. Long-term management of chronic disease is often poorly coordinated, with communication between specialists and GPs that has changed little in the last 40 years, despite huge changes in the way in which care is provided. New ways of organising care for chronic illness are needed for the changing needs of our patient population.
<LI>Continuity of care. One of the questions about primary care in the future is whether the loss of continuity which results from working in larger teams is outweighed by the benefits that result. I do not think that continuity of care is always essential. However, there are occasions when personal care from one's own doctor becomes extremely important. We need to be able to describe those situations where continuity of care makes a real difference to outcome. Some of the developments I have described make personal continuity of care look seriously endangered. My belief is that personal continuity is a feature of NHS care that is worth vigorously defending.
</OL>

<P>
<B>The Need to Assure Quality</B> 
<P>
I move on from definitions of quality to assuring quality. As the emphasis on purchasing effective care in the NHS increases and as we start to experience health commissions purchasing care from the primary sector, quality assurance will become increasingly important. Audit is on the way out, being replaced by purchasing for quality - or some other suitable slogan. The message to the profession is clear: if they do not lead on this issue then they will be led, whether they like it or not. In the area where I work a novel collaboration between the local medical committee and the health authority has developed a range of quality standards to which the majority of Manchester practices working towards. There is a real opportunity over the next few years for professionals to work with Government and health authorities to define the important elements of quality and to determine how they can be delivered and assured.
<P>

<B>A Vision for the Future</B> 
<P>
I conclude with seven points which are my vision for a future which preserves the strengths of British primary care.

<OL>
<LI>A model of primary care based around the general practice team has served Britain well. It is a model which other countries are now seeking to emulate. This basic feature of the NHS does not need fixing.
<LI>It is difficult to operate a well-functioning team where there are more than 12 or so doctors and nurses. If care continues, as I believe it should, to be centred around a core general practice team, the team needs to find new ways of interacting and communicating with the increasing number of other professionals who, quite appropriately, are providing care from a community base.
<LI>The relationship between the health professional and his or her patient is key to providing high-quality patient care. Personal continuity is not always important but it is sometimes very important.
I am not suggesting that general practice should return to the days of Dr Finlay and Tannochbrae, but if we allow general practice to become like a department store then our patients will be the losers. We must remember this when developing quality indicators for general practice and, in particular, protect the time needed for the encounter between the doctor or nurse and his or her patient.
<LI>There are opportunities which are at present poorly realised for individual doctors or nurses within practices to develop specific skills. Specialisation within practices offers the opportunity to increase the range of services available. The amount of referral that occurs within practices could be increased. Fear that these developments will lead to a mini-specialoid service are probably overplayed.
<LI>The profession must seize the opportunity to define quality standards. There is a window of opportunity in the next few years that must be grasped.
<LI>Where expert advice is needed we need much better ways of communication. The growth in IT offers great opportunity for desktop decision support for GPs, which may enable them with confidence
to undertake the increasing amounts of care being asked of them. Telemedicine may offer opportunities for rapid access to brief specialist advice, which is notably lacking in the NHS at the
moment.
<LI>Finally, however models of purchasing develop in the NHS, I am sure that GPs need an important voice in the services provided for their patients. I am less convinced that GPs, whose main interest is personal care, are the best people to plan the health care of populations. I do not agree with those who believe that the future of public health medicine is somehow to become hybridised with general practice. Both disciplines have distinct contributions to make.
</OL>

<P>
The Government has correctly recognised the potential of a primary care-led NHS and the potential for general practice to take a leading role in that change. Yet as we have heard, perversely, at a time when general practice should be riding high, morale is lower than for many years. This is for many reasons, some of which we have heard, one of which is that a transfer of work to the primary sector has taken place without a comparable transfer of resources. Morale and resourcing need to be tackled. Adequately resourced, properly motivated, British primary care has the potential to become the envy of the world.

HEED is very easy to use, even for beginners. There are no complex commands to learn and nearly all operations are simply 'point and click'. HEED has been designed for easy reference and frequent use.

<P>
With 54 fields to choose from, the database can be searched by selecting only those search criteria of relevance. The search criteria are grouped into a number of subject groupings. Each subject grouping contains specific search criteria, which can be specified in any combination (in addition to wild card and Boolean functions) to search the database. The search criteria can be modified and refined to quickly access search results in manageable quantities.

<P>
The subject groupings include:

<UL>
<LI>Bibliographical details
<LI>Study definitions
<LI>Analysis and results
<LI>Keywords.
</UL>

<P>
It is also possible to search HEED using keywords or any combination of the search criteria that includes:

<UL>
<LI>Author name
<LI>Book/Journal name
<LI>Countries applicable
<LI>Publication dates
<LI>Publication status
<LI>Study dates
<LI>ATC classifications
<LI>Data Sources
<LI>Drug names
<LI>ICD-9 classifications
<LI>Non-drug technologies
<LI>Technology assessed
<LI>Type of article
<LI>Type of economic evaluation
<LI>Costs included
<LI>Discounting
<LI>Outcomes
<LI>Patient groups
<LI>Sensitivity analysis
<LI>Sources of clinical and economic information
<LI>Sponsor
</UL>

<P>
Search criteria can be saved for use at a later date.
<P>

<B>Formatted Reports</B> 
<P>
The HEED CD-ROM reports will present the results of searches in a clear easy-to-read format.
<P>
There are four default report formats:

<UL>
<LI>Search Report
<LI>Summary Report
<LI>Brief Report
<LI>Detailed Report.
</UL>

<P>
The reports will present the results of searches at increasing levels of detail. The Detailed Report will additionally provide details of the study question, key results and, providing copyright permission has been given by the article publisher, the article abstract in full.

<P>
Hypertext links are available so that the ICD-9 and ATC sub-reports can be accessed.
<P>

<B>Academic Panel</B> 
<P>
A panel of academic advisors is providing guidance on the search and review processes. The panel comprises Martin Buxton, Mike Drummond, Bernie O'Brien, Kevin Schulman, Bengt Jonsson, Frans
Rutten, Joan Rovira and Akinori Hisashige.
<P>

<B>Organisation</B> 
<P>
HEED has been set up with finance from more than 20 companies in the USA, Europe and Japan, who comprise the Steering Group for the project. New industry subscribers will be included in
a user group designed to ensure the service develops in accordance with industry needs.

<center><B>OHE COMPENDIUM OF HEALTH STATISTICS</B></center>
<P>

<B>10th Edition 1996</B> 
<P>
The 10th edition of the Compendium of Health Statistics is currently being prepared by Sean McGuigan, who has recently taken over from Bob Chew as OHE Statistician.

<P>
Sean plans to have the Compendium ready by the third quarter of 1996.
<P>
Although the Compendium will broadly follow the form of its predecessors, users can expect to see improvements in several areas. There will be more information about data sources, graphical methods of data presentation will be improved and an index will be added. A recent market research exercise has provided many useful suggestions for development of the Compendium; as a result, several new data series will appear in the 10th edition. Sean would welcome any comments you may have on the Compendium.
<P>
