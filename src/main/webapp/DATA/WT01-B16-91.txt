<H3>Prospects for power generation to 2010: the impact of growth on
 CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions and the role 
of nuclear energy. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/odelbio.html">Se&aacute;n O'Dell</A></H3>

This paper is an overview of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Economic 
Outlook to 2010 and is based upon the macroeconomic projections of the OECD, IMF and 
World Bank.

<P>
The IEA has assumed that satisfying demand could become problematic and has therefore 
proposed two alternatives under which demand may be reduced from what it might otherwise 
be. In the capacity constraints case (CCC) past trends are assumed to continue with the result 
that demand growth is too fast for production to keep up and prices rise dampening demand 
growth. In the energy savings case (ESC) it is assumed that imposed energy efficiency 
improvements, using currently available technology, will lead to restrained growth without 
price rises. 

<P>
Under the CCC primary energy demand is estimated to increase 44% by 2010 to about 11 500 
million toe at 2.1% pa while under the ESC the figure is 35% to a level of about 10 500 
million toe at 1.7% pa. Under both projections fuel shares are expected to remain broadly in 
line with today's figures but nuclear is expected to decline and renewables are expected to 
account for only 1% of demand. Carbon based fuels will continue to account for 90% of 
primary energy.

<P>
Electricity generation is projected to increase by 8000 TWh (CCC) or 6000 TWh (ESC). 
Under CCC fossil based generation is projected to grow faster than capacity while under ESC 
the fossil share decreases. The fuel of choice for many new projects will be gas with both 
hydro and nuclear projected to suffer a falling share worldwide though the position will vary 
from region to region. Despite a strong growth projection for renewables, a low starting point 
means that they are projected to meet only 1.2% (CCC) or 2.1% (ESC) of demand by 2010.

<P>
By 2010 global energy related CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions are expected to be over 40% above 1990 levels 
under CCC and about 30% above 1990 under ESC with most of this increase occurring in the 
developing world where emissions will rise from 6 billion tonnes CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> in 1990 to 13 billion 
tonnes in 2010, 45% of the world total. The IEA projections indicate that the stabilisation of 
emissions at 1990 levels by 2010 is unlikely to be achieved in any region.

<P>
To date nuclear energy has played a significant role in limiting CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions. In 1992 
emissions would have been about 11% higher without nuclear electricity. If the nuclear 
growth of the last 25 years were to continue emissions in 2010 would be about 2 billion 
tonnes less than projected by the IEA.
