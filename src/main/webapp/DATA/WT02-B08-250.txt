<h1 align=center>SPRI TIMESAVER</h1>
<h3 align=center>If you want to study books but not the system</h3> 

<b>SPRI Timesaver</b> is a new service designed for those planning to visit 
SPRI library but with limited time to spend here.<p>  

All libraries are unique and few more so than this one.  The key to using
the library effectively is detailed knowledge of the 162-page schedule of
the <b><i>Universal Decimal Classification for Use in Polar
Libraries</i></b>.  This classification schedule is used both to arrange
publications on shelves and to provide detailed indexing to subject
content.  Do you have time to give <b><i>UDC</i></b> the study it
deserves?  Do you have time to learn the innovative - though idiosyncratic
- probabilistic feedback-based interface to the <b>SPRILIB</b>
database?<p>

If the answer is yes, read no further. I shall be happy to instruct you in 
the intricacies of <b><i>UDC</i></b> and <b>SPRILIB</b>.<p>

If no, <b>SPRI Timesaver</b> may offer what you need.  Subscribers to this 
service are provided with:

<ul>
<li>a desk reserved for your use 
<li>a SPRILIB bibliography on your topic (up to 100 records)
<li>selected publications brought to your desk
<li>free photocopying by staff of requested articles  (up to 50 A4 pages 
per day)
</ul>

The fee for the standard <b>SPRI Timesaver</b> service is £30.00 
($45.00) per day.  Bibliographies of over 100 records, more than one 
bibliography, or photocopying over 50 A4 pages per day, may all be 
arranged but at an additional cost.  If you would like to use <b>SPRI 
Timesaver</b>, please
complete the <a href="timesav2.htm">Timesaver application form</a> and 
return it to me as soon as possible so that the bibliography may be sent 
to you in advance of your visit.<p>
