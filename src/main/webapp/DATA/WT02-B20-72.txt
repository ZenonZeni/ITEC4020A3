  This digest discusses the dilemma surrounding foreign language requirements 
at colleges and universities and students with learning disabilities.  Many 
students and professionals question the reasonableness of foreign language 
requirements for students with learning disabilities, but, according to Section 
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, colleges and universities are not 
required to waive such requirements.  The digest focuses specifically on the 
following: waivers and course substitutions, alternatives to waivers and course 
substitutions, considerations involved in teaching foreign languages to 
students with learning disabilities, and the Orton-Gillingham Technique.  A 
program designed for teaching Latin to learning disabled students is described, 
and information on a conference that focuses specifically on foreign language 
learning and learning disabilities is provided.  (VWL)<BR>

  The Orton-Gillingham method, a multisensory structured language approach 
which adheres to the direct and explicit teaching of phonology, is presented as 
an alternative instructional strategy for dyslexic/learning-disabled or other 
"at risk" students learning a second language.  A method for adapting this 
approach to teaching Spanish is described.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Journal Announcement: RIEMAR84<BR>
    The paper summarizes four presentations made by members of the Pennsylvania 
State University Program for Learning Disabled (LD) students.  An initial 
section considers the definition of LD and reviews a study on diagnosing LD in 
12 undergraduates.  The existence of a foreign language disability in students 
with good attitudes toward learning a foreign language, but who have repeatedly 
failed foreign language courses, is discussed, and analysis of scores on the 
Modern Language Aptitude Test are analyzed.  A study to develop norms for 
evaluating written expression is  described.  Intervention programing is said to 
include procedures based on behavioral theories as well as availability of 
special equipment on a long term basis.  Intervention is programed according to 
the amount of structure needed by the student.  (CL)<BR>
