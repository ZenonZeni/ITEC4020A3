<p>Each year since 1983, the first full week in October 
has been observed as Mental Illness Awareness 
Week (MIAW). It was originally established by 
Congressional Resolution. To obtain this 
legislation, organizations urge their senators and 
representatives, by phone and letter, to co-sponsor 
MIAW resolutions. The work is hard and 
continuous. </p>
<p>But it is only part of the work. During the Week, 
literally tens of thousands of dedicated mental health 
care professionals, treatment facilities, affiliates of 
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), 
chapters of the National Depressive and 
Manic-Depressive Association, members of the 
American Psychiatric Association, affiliates of the 
National Mental Health Association, local Mental 
Health Associations, civic groups, officials, 
religious organizations, and concerned citizens join 
in a true grassroots campaign to bring information, 
hope and treatment to millions. They urge state and 
local legislators to pass their own MIAW 
recognitions and they hold mental health fairs and 
candlelight vigils, produce special television 
programs, screen public education films and give 
countless speeches and presentations before 
classrooms, PTAs, local government and civic 
leaders and groups. </p>
<p>What began as an effort to increase Congressional 
awareness has become a nationwide week long 
observance. Judging by the mounting interest during 
each year, MIAW is an effort that will continue.</p>

<p>This year&#146;s Mental Illness Awareness Week&#146;s 
theme is &quot;Open Your Mind: Mental Illnesses Are 
Brain Disorders.&quot; The theme emphasizes mental 
illnesses are physical illnesses and highlights the 
biology of brain disorders in order to reduce the 
stigma and discrimination facing people with mental 
illnesses. The artwork and slogan reflect NAMI&#146;s 
Campaign to End Discrimination. </p>
<p>NAMI members across the country will be 
organizing rallys, candlelight vigils, educational 
forums, and awareness events. Each affiliate has 
received a NAMI Mental Illness Awareness Week 
kit. Please contact your local affiliate/state AMI to 
become involved in Mental Illness Awareness 
Week activities. </p>
