<H4><u>Eating Disorders</u></H4>
Many young people mistakenly pursue a thin, muscular body in the belief that it is the "ideal" 
body shape. This unrealistic goal is reinforced by the fashion, fitness, mass media and tobacco 
industries in advertising their products. THERE IS IN FACT NO SINGLE IDEAL BODY SHAPE.
Two eating disorders related to the pursuit of the "ideal" body are threatening the health and 
happiness of young people today. They are Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia. They can have devastating
effects on sufferers and their families. They can be fatal.
<p>
Anorexia Nervosa is a disorder characterized by an intense fear of becoming obese. Lack of 
self-esteem, depression and feeling fat in spite of noticeable thinness result in behaviours 
such as deliberate self-starvation, excessive exercising, "pickiness" in food choices and 
serious weight loss.
<p>
Bulimia is also characterized by an excessive concern about body weight and shape. Bulimics 
engage in recurrent episodes of binge eating which result in fear of being overweight. This is 
followed by weight control methods such as self-induced vomiting, fasting, use of diuretics, 
purging with laxatives and excessive exercising.
