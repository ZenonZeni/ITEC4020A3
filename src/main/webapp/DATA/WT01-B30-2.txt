<font size="2">The government's strategy for stopping the production and the
trafficking of cocaine and heroin destined for the United States suffers
from a lack of interagency coordination, poor management of funds, and a
lack of commitment from some foreign governments to combat the drug
trade in their countries. Although the United States has changed its
international strategy on cocaine from law enforcement and drug seizures
in the transit zone to stopping drugs in the source countries, the
executive branch has had difficulty implementing a key part of the
strategy--shifting resources from the transit zone to source countries.
Also, a proposed heroin strategy still awaits the President's approval.
Moreover, the willingness and the ability of foreign governments to
fight the drug trade in their countries varies.  Recent steps taken by
the government of Colombia, such as the arrests of three high-level
members of the Cali Cartel, have been positive, but continuing
commitment is needed.  Even when foreign governments are willing to
fully participate in counternarcotics efforts, they often lack the
necessary resources.  Extensive corruption in some countries further
weakens efforts to counter the drug trade.
