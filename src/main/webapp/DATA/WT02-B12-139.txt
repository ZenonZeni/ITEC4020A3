Froomkin on Clipper keys <p>

The tireless eagle@armory.com dug this up, not sure if you've seen it. <p>

From:   IN%"MFROOMKI@umiami.ir.miami.edu"  "Michael Froomkin" <p>

The cites are there (and in a good administrative law book too: try eg
Mashaw, Merril &amp; Shane 3rd ed.) <p>

_Executive Summary_ <p>

Bottom line for the crypto proposal: <p>

Congress cannot hold the keys.
Courts cannot hold the keys.
Only an agency in the executive branch of government can hold the
keys. <p>

Up to a point (which is not well defined) an agency can be created
with is headed by a person shielded from Presidential dismissal
(commonly known as an "independent agency").  It may be that the
head of this agency could be appointed by the court, although the
leading case on the subject concerns the appointment of a
prosecutor by a court, which is a more traditional judicial
function than the appointment of a trustee or custodian. <p>

_ The Problem _ <p>

The Supreme Court's separation of powers decisions are
generally agreed to be hopelessly contradictory.  Academic
commentators accuse the Court, with much justice, of zigzagging
between formalism and functionalism.  See, e.g.,  Stephen L.
Carter, From Sick Chicken to Synar: The Evolution and Subsequent
De-Evolution of the Separation of Powers, 1987 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 719;
Stephen L. Carter, The Independent Counsel Mess, 102 Harv. L. Rev.
105 (1988); Erwin Chemerinsky, A Paradox Without a Principle: A
Comment on the Burger Court's Jurisprudence in Separation of Powers
Cases, 60 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1083 (1987); E. Donald Elliott, Why Our
Separation of Powers Jurisprudence Is So Abysmal, 57 Geo. Wash. L.
Rev. 506 (1989); Peter L. Strauss, The Place of Agencies in
Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum.
L. Rev. 573 (1984).  Peter L. Strauss, Was There A Baby In the
Bathwater?  A Comment on the Supreme Court's Legislative Veto
Decision, 1983 Duke L.J. 789. <p>

If one can bring oneself to ignore the doctrinal temptations
posed by the irreconcilable rationales of the cases set out below,
there is a general rule which explains all the results and even
offers some hope of predicting outcomes in future cases: Just as
Congress may increase the other two branches' powers by statutes
conferring jurisdiction (on courts) or rule-making/action-taking
power (on the executive branch), so too may Congress constrain the
other two branches' exercise of their powers so long as Congress
strictly obeys two fundamental constraints. <p>

First, Congress must obey the strictures set out in Buckley
and Chadha, that neither it nor other persons in the legislative
branch (broadly defined, cf. Bowsher), may constitutionally take
any action that affects the rights, duties, or responsibilities of
any person outside that branch except via the procedures of
bicameralism and presentment set out in Article I.  See I.N.S. v.
Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976);
and Metropolitan Wash. Airports, __ U.S. __, 111 S. Ct. 2298
(1991). <p>

Second, the courts have jurisdiciton only to decide "cases
and controversies".   Outside the context of a lawsuit, there
are few acts that courts may take which might affect anyone's rights.
Courts may make rules of procedure, and they can (if Congress
wishes) make inter-branch appointments.  But that's about it. <p>

Third, all three branches' powers can be divided into the two
classes of enumerated and unenumerated powers.  Congress' power to
limit the President's enumerated powers is relatively slight.  It
exists only when Congress can assert a directly relevant enumerated
power of its own.  See, e.g., Public Citizen v. United States Dep't
of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 467, 483-89 (1989) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in judgment) (application of open meetings law to ABA
consultation with Justice Department on judicial appointments would
impermissibly infringe President's enumerated appointment power);
Nixon, 433 U.S. at 443 (upholding statutory intrusion into disposal
of presidential papers on grounds that President had no relevant
enumerated power); United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128
(1871) (statute seeking to alter effect of presidential pardon
unconstitutional interference with enumerated presidential power).
But, Congress' power to check other, unenumerated, presidential
powers is somewhat greater. <p>

Overall, the Court's decisions fit a pattern in which
Congress' power to check the other branches by determining their
structure is very great, but Congress is checked by the
requirements that it not aggrandize its own powers and that it act
through persons outside the legislature (which usually means
persons in the Executive or the Judiciary, although Congress is
also capable of taking certain types of actions, such as granting
a charter to a federal corporation, which act directly on private
parties and require little or no action by the other branches).
Thus, in Myers, Buckley, Chadha, Bowsher, and Metropolitan
Airports, separation of powers was violated by Congress seeking to
reserve an executive power for itself.  Myers concerned a
congressional attempt to require Senatorial approval before a
postmaster was fired.  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926).
Bowsher held that the Comptroller General could not be an executive
branch official because Congress reserved the right to remove him
by legislation.  Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 714.  Chadha struck down the
one-house veto because it impermissibly inserted Congress into an
executive function.  Chadha, 461 U.S. at 919.  Metropolitan
Airports held that Congresspersons could not serve on a commission
that had the power to reverse certain executive decisions.
Metropolitan Wash. Airports, 111 S. Ct. at 2298.  Humphrey's
Executor, Wiener, Morrison, Schor, and Mistretta all concerned
cases in which Congress had lessened the President's power (or
increased the Judiciary's) without reserving a corresponding power
for itself.  In Humphrey's Executor, Weiner, and Morrison the
statute in question reduced the President's removal power but did
not inject Congress into the procedure.  By contrast, in Commodity
Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 856 (1986), the
Court noted that Congress was not seeking to increase its own
powers.  Indeed, when the issue is an unenumerated presidential
power, such as the power to remove executive branch officials, the
Supreme Court has, since at least 1838, most consistently focused
on whether Congress has impermissibly aggrandized itself, not on
whether the President's "nebulous" executive power is being
undermined.  See Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524
(1838) (stating that although the President has a special
constitutional position "it by no means follows that every officer
in every branch of [a] department is under the exclusive direction
of the President"). <p>

Detailed discussion of a few issues of interest:
[For a fuller statement of the issues, see A. Michael Froomkin,
Note, In Defense of Administrative Agency Autonomy, 96 Yale L.J.
787 (1987) and Peter L. Strauss, The Place of Agencies in
Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum.
L. Rev. 573 (1984).] <p>

_The Myers Decision_ <p>

In Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) (holding statute
requiring Senate consent to presidential removal of postmaster was
unconstitutional). and Springer  Springer v. Government of
Philippine Islands, 277 U.S. 189 (1928) (holding that statute
permitting certain members of Phillippine legislature to vote
government-owned shares in corporations ex officio violated
principle of separation of powers) the Supreme Court took a
decidedly formalist approach to the problem, in which each branch's
powers were seen to be discernable and distinct. <p>

_The Modern View: Limits to Presidential Power (Constitutional
      Basis for Independent Agencies &amp; limits to their autonomy)_ <p>

The modern view begins with Humphrey's Executor v. United
States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) (upholding statute preventing President
from firing FTC Commissioner without cause against constitutional
challenge) and Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958)
(holding that statute which was silent as to tenure in office of
member of "quasi-judicial" War Claims Commission would be
interpreted to bar President from dismissing member without cause).
In this more "functionalist" view, Congress is allowed to constrain
the power of the executive but did not consider to what extent
Congress could act by means other than legislation. <p>

_Limits to Congressional Power_ <p>

I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983) (holding that a two-
house legislative veto violates constitutional requirement that
Congress act in accordance with Presentment Clause of
Constitution), Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (holding that
Congresspersons could not constitutionally serve on FEC), Bowsher
v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986) (holding that Comptroller General
could not be an executive branch official because Congress reserved
the right to remove him by legislation and that therefore he could
not constitutionally exercise budget-cutting powers given to him by
Deficit Reduction Act) and Metropolitan Wash. Airports Auth. v.
Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., __ U.S. __, 111
S. Ct. 2298 (1991) (holding that participation of members of
Congress in committee with power to veto decisions regarding local
airports violated separation of powers) collectively stand for the
proposition that unless Congress is using a constitionally
ennumerated power (e.g. the Senate's advice and consent power over
nominations and treaties), or regulationg purely internal matters
(e.g. who will be the Sargent at Arms of the House), the *only* way
in which Congress may affect the rightrs, duties or
responsibilities of a person outside the legislative branch is by
legislation, which is defined constitutionally as acts of both
houses which are the presented to the President for his signature. <p>

_The Courts' Inter-Bramch Appointment Power_ <p>

In Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988) (upholding
constitutionality of independent special prosecutor) the Supreme
Court upheld a procedure by which the special prosecutor was
appointed by the court.  The opinion has been criticized fo
fudging the extent to which the special prosecutor was independent
of the President and Attorney General.  But the inter-branch
appointment power is rooted in the constitution, which states that
Congress may vest the appointment of "inferior officers, as they
think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in
the Heads of Departments." (U.S. Const. Art II. sec. 2 para 2). <p>

_ Limits on Judicial Power _ <p>

Marbury v. Madison held that the federal courts have the power
and duty to refuse to take on tasks that are beyond their
jurisdiction.  Federal courts have historically been conscious of
hteir status as courts of limited jurisdiction and have been
vigillant to block moves by congress to give them non-judical
tasks.  Thus, for example, federal courts have refused to give
advisory opinions.  It is a truism, but no less true for that
reason, that a federal court has no jurisdiction to affect private
or public rights in the absence of a case or controversy. <p>

The closest thing to contrary authority of which I am aware is
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989) (upholding
constitutionality of Sentencing Commission against challenge
predicated on participation of Article III judges on commission).
The decision justified the participation of judges on the grounds
that sentencing was a judicial matter. <p>
