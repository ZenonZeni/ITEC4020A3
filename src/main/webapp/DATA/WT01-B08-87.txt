        <p><strong>Half of the Chilean population (49%) believes
        Chile's Mercosur membership will be benefitial for the
        country according to a poll taken in the main cities and
        the camp. Nevertheless, in rural areas the support is
        significantly less than in the urban areas. <br>
        The poll also showed that 45% of Chileans believe the
        country is progressing while 39% said it was stagnant and
        13% in decadence. Support for President Frei's
        administration reached 44%, but 33% rejected the present
        government policies. Most Chileans also believe the
        government has been &quot;soft&quot; on lobbies and
        pressure groups. <br>
        A similar Mercosur poll taken in Argentina showed 56% of
        Argentine public opinion in favour of Chile's entry and
        only 19% considered it harmfull.</strong> </p>

        <p><strong>Mercosur countries have rejected the Clinton's
        administration decision to sanction any oil and gas
        company dealing with Iran and Lybia. The Iran and Lybia
        Sanctions Act 1996, similar in spirit to the Helms-Burton
        which punishes companies trading with Cuba, has also
        become for Washington an area of confrontation with
        Europe. For Uruguay the bill if finally enacted could
        have very negative consequences since Iran has been for
        the last decade an important market for wool, rice and
        beef in exchange for oil. Uruguay also lost as a
        consequence of the UN Irak embargo during the Gulf War a
        40.000 tons of mutton market in Bagdad. </strong></p>
