We garden in raised beds and our garden beds are
 full of tiny black ants.  Is there a safe way to
 get rid of the ants that won't leave chemicals in
the soil that could leach into our vegetables?</P></B>
<P>Yes!!  Easy answer!!  Boiling hot water works wonders.  If they don't
get the message the first time, they certainly do by the
second...Obviously, keep off of your plants, etc.</P>

<P>BUT...I recently read an abstract of a study done in the midwest looking
at the benefits of mice and ants in no-till cornfields.  Did you know
that ants ate 95% of the weed seed in the study area!!!!!!!  Are you
sure you want to get rid of these ladies?  Ants are after all, as one
entomologist friend of mine likes to say, mother nature's little garbage
ladies!  So unless they are actually doing harm to the plants, like
farming aphids, you might think twice about killing them all, 'cause
they just might be doing you a big favor in the meantime.....</P>

<P>Hope you will look for our products in your area!!  You'll find us at
local nureries (Mitchels; fertilizers at Wasatch; Western Garden
Centers; Mill Creek; and of course Fred Meyer).</P>

I have a flower garden and the main problem I have is that a hedgehog keeps eating the flowers. What can I do to prevent the hedgehog from feasting on
my flowers?</P></B>

<P>The only experience I have with gardening in New England is the summers
spent as a child in my grand fathers garden in Pittsfield, MA.  I can't
recall hedgehogs being a problem for him....Out here on the West Coast,
no hedge hogs.  But somewhere in the recesses of my mind I recall
reading about coping with these guys in a garden setting, and if my
memory serves I believe the recommendation was a fence much as you would
build to keep out rabbits.  Not the simplest solution, I realize...</P>

<P>You might consider a trip to the library and a check of the
periodicals--I have a recollection of the article appearing in either
Horticulture or Organic Gardening.</P>

Dear Whitney Farms-- Any suggestions for squirrels eating bulbs and taking off the flower heads just as they start to open.  I had heard that their is so
solution that you can soak the bulbs (tulips in particular) before
planting. </P></B> 


<P>I haven't heard of a solution for treating bulbs, so I am afraid that I
can't help you there.  Standard recommendations include fences, cages or
screens; traps; repellents; and poison baits.  Not a very creative set
of alternatives...I'll keep your query and should I here of anything
else I'll forward it to you.</P>

<P>I wonder if one of those plastic owl "predators" strategically placed
between the squirrels and your garden would help?</P>

Dear Whitney Farms-- My tomato plants are being eaten by something leaving tiny holes in the
leaves. I have basil and marigolds interspersed with the plants to keep
away critters, but its not working with these. What can I use that's not
poison?</P></B>

<P>Sounds to me like flea beetle damage to me.  Symptoms look like someone
shot your tomatoes with a shotgun.  Leaves are riddled with little holes
about 1/8 inch in diameter.  If you look closely, you may see tiny
little black beetles around 1/16th of an inch that jump like fleas when
disturbed--in fact it often makes it hard to see them.</P>

<P>If they are attacking seedlings, one suggestion would be to provide them
with protection until they are old enough to out grow the attack.
Usually, flea beetle damage is the worst on seedlings and once plants
get older they may remain present but limit their damage to older leaves
lower on the plant with less effect on the host plant.</P>

<P>There are a number of fabrics available that would work.  Look for "spun
bonded polyesters" (Reemay).  Look for lightweight fabrics called
"floating row covers," not "frost blanket" materials which are quite a
bit heavier.  While these fabrics are designed to "float" on the plants
as they grow, for use around tomatoes I would suggest building a support
structure.  It can be as simple as plastic or wire hoops with the fabric
draped over it and held down securely.</P>

<P>Use the row covers while the plants are young.  Once the plants get
large enough to tolerate some damage, remove the covers.  The thing to
watch for is the temperature under the covers getting too hot.  With
forecasts in your area in the eighties this week, some covers could
raise the temperature to lethal levels; spunbonded floating fabrics are
usually sheer enough to allow enough air movement through them that they
do not reach temperatures harmful to warm season crops like tomatoes.
Remove them before they interfere with the plants vertical growth.
Usually by the time the plants have more than six true leaves and are
growing vigorously they will out grow the flea bettle damage.</P>

<P>A friend of mine once trapped the beetles on young cabbage plants by
getting a gallon bottle of apple juice--the big old fashioned jug
type--and carefully removing the bottom of the bottle (quite a feat!).
He then coated the inside of the bottle with a sticky material called
Tanglefoot.  He would go from plant to plant, quickly covering them with
the bottle.  The beetles would jump from the plant and get stuck in the
Tanglefoot. He did this once or twice a day while the seedlings were
susceptible.  It was labor intensive, but we were able to save the crop
of cabbage.</P>

<P>If the seedlings are severely damaged, you have few choices.  One would
be to replant and protect the new plants as outlined above, another
would be to spray pesticides containing either pyrethrum or rotenone.
Both of these products are approved for use by organic farmers, but they
are pesticides and should be handled with care and used according to the
label.  Some rotenone products are combined with insecticidal soaps and
these have been reported to have been particularly effective.</P>

<P>Finally, be sure to till any corp residues or into the soil next fall.
The flea beetles over winter in debris and weeds.  Tilling them under
will help to reduce the population next spring.</P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- Our lawn is seriously infected with grubs (Japanese Beetle).  Is there an organic solution to eliminating these pests?
 I have read about "Milky Spores" and "Nematodes".  I cannot locate any reseller of the "Milky Spore" products and I am unaware of how
organic/effective "Nematodes" are.
 Please HELP! The beetles have defoliated me by August.</P></B>


<P>One thing I really like about being a gardener/citizen of the West--NO
JAPANESE BEETLES!!  (The exclamation was followed by a quick rap on the
proverbial piece of wood...)  I remember them from the years I spent
growing up in Virginia and I do not miss them...</P>

<P>Obviously, the first step is to ensure that your lawn is getting all it
needs to be healthy.  Use a quality organic lawn fertilizer.  Follow our
tips on the web page for a healthy lawn.</P>

<P>As to the availability of Milky Spore it is not something I have seen
available out here on the West Coast.  But since we do not have Japanese
Beetles to contend with, it probably should not come as a surprise.  I
would suggest getting in touch with the folks at Organic
Gardening/Rodale Press.  I am certain they could help you find the
product.  You also might try "Gardens Alive!".  They are out of the
midwest and I get there catalog from time to time--but I just recycled
all of my old catalogs! so I don't have an address for them to give you.
Once again, the folks at Organic Gardening could probably help you with
that.</P>

<P>Here are some other phone numbers of folk's who supply beneficial
insects, etc.:</P>

<P>Worms Way--800-274-9676
Peaceful Valley Farm Supply--916-272-4769
Arbico--800-827-2847 ext. OG596</P>

<P>I know the first two companies and would recommend them highly.  Worms
Way is based in the Eastern US, and would be the first place to check.
Peaceful Valley is in California, but they do supply a lot of
organic growers and might have some info on the availability of Milky
Spore.</P>

<P>As to the predatory nematodes.  They work!!  I have used them
successfully to control root maggots on broccoli and cabbage.  We use it
here in the Pacific North West to control root weevil larvae on
rhododendrons with great success--it's even recommended by the Oregon
State Extension Service.  I know that it is widely used to great effect
on "grubs" in the lawn, and I know that it is labeled specifically for
Japanese Beetle larvae.  I have seen a video of how these guys 'work'
and it is very nasty!!  I would hate to be a beetle larvae and get
attacked by these nematodes--the result is not pretty, for the grub...
They are also very effective for controlling fleas.</P>

<P>I would feel very confident recommending them to you.  The most widely
available brand is Biosafe.  It should be easy to find.  (As to the
"organic" nature--the nematodes themselves are definitely 100% approved
for organic control by all of the major certifying organizations in the
US.  The Biosafe brand does have a preservative and so it falls into a
gray area; there are pure strains available.  (Worms Way and Peaceful
Valley will probably have those for you...)</P>

<P>The trick to using it is ensuring that your soil temperature is high
enough for the nematode to survive.  About 55 degrees F.  For a severe
infestation, it might require a couple of applications over a couple of
years, and you will never completely eradictae the beetles.  But you can
control them.  Check with your local Extension Service to find out when
the grubs are likely to be feeding/active in the soil and treat at that
time.</P>

<P><B>Massachusetts coast<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms -- Are there any organic solutions for birch leaf miner?</P></B>

<P>I was not able to find any information on birch leaf miners
specifically.  Here are some general guidelines:</P>

<P>1)  Because most leaf miners feed only on leaves, plants can usually
tolerate substantial mining without loss (the particular reference was
to fruit trees and crop yields--but I think the point is important--if a
fruit tree will be largely unaffected by leaf miners, then it is fairly
safe to assume that the birch will not be dramatically impacted by the
presence of the pest.)</P>

<P>2)  Leaf miners are often kept under control by natural enemies,
including parasitic wasps.</P>

<P>3)  Leaf miner outbreaks often follow insecticide sprays for other
pests.</P>

<P>So, my suggestions would be to check with the local extension service to
see if they know if anyone is supplying predatory wasps in your area that
will attack the leaf miner.  It has been reported that they will
actually attack the leaf miner through the leaf tissue.  If the
infestation is bad enough, you may actually have a population of
beneficials hard at work getting things under control.  DON'T use a
broad spectrum insecticide!  It will not only kill the leaf miners, but
also all the beneficial insects in, under, or around the tree.  In all
likelihood, the leaf miners will return and the predators will not be
around to slow the spread--the problem only gets worse.  Any number of
predators may be out there controlling the leaf miners, these include:
green lacewings and spiders (control eggs and adults) or other natural
enemies like ants, true bugs, some species of flies and birds.</P>

<P>I know that when the larvae is ready to pupate it drops down into the
soil emerging 10 to 15 days later as adults.  I am not certain if it
would work, but there are predatory nematodes that attack soil dwelling
larvae like grubs.  You'll find these under the name Biosafe (there are
other brands out there as well) at nurseries and garden centers.  If
your extension service can give you an approximate time frame when the
larva drop to the soil, you could try an application of biosafe.</P>

<P>I have also seen a reference to a new generation of microbially derived
insecticides like Avid (avermectin) as effective against leaf miners
while showing little toxicity to its parasites.  It is registered for use
in some vegetable and fruit crops.  Generally, these new pesticides
are characterized by relatively low toxicity and specific
action--less likelihood of non target species getting wiped out too.
The drawback?  To my knowledge it is only available in commercial and
not retail formulations and as such it is relatively expensive.</P>

<P>I am sorry I can not give you a specific solution, but I hope I have
given you some insight into the concept of organic pest control.  Let
nature do the bulk of the work.  Recognize that you can not permanently
and totally eradicate the leaf miners, so create conditions that
encourage the presence of their natural predators.  Finally, ensure that
your trees are getting adequate moisture and nutrition so that they are
better able to resist the attack of the insects.</P>

 Dear Whitney Farms -- Every year I have a problem with potato bugs.  I was wondering if you had an organic or environmental safe method of getting rid of these
pests.  Thank you. </P></B>

<P>I am not sure what pest you are referring too when you say "potato bugs."
In my childhood, I remember a big brown insect we commonly called a
potato bug, that to my knowledge is not a plant pest persay, though it
is quite UGLY!  Then there are a whole collection of insect pests who
feed on potatoes.  These would include Colorado Potato Beetles, Flea
Beetles, Potato Leafhoppers, European Corn Borers, Wireworms, and
others. </P>

<P>Most of these insects can be controlled organically using pyrethrum
products.  In-"organic" controls would include diazinon or sevin.  Exact
instructions vary slightly depending on the pest. </P>

<P>If possible, a general description of the pest would help me give you a
more precise answer.  You could also check with your local extension
office for a diagnosis.  If you are interested in organic control
methods and they are unable to help you, email us again, and I will try
to give you more specific information.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- What can I do to get rid of grub worms? </P></B>

<P>The description "grubworms" is a bit on the generic side, and you didn't
indicate where you were having trouble with them--lawn?; garden?;
vegetable garden?  So I will give you a general response and address
some of the more common pests that are often called grubworms. </P>

<P>First, there are the larvae of a number of different species of beetles.
These grubs feed on the roots of the lawn and can kill the entire lawn
if left untreated.  Generally, the adult beetles do not damage the lawn,
but they do lay eggs in the soil which hatch into voracious turf pests.
Depending on the actual beetle in your yard, they lay eggs in the
spring and summer (May and June Beetles) or in mid- to late-summer
(Asiatic, Japanese, and masked chafer beetles).  After hatching the
grubs feed on the roots in the top 1-3 inches of soil.  In late fall,
they move down deep into the soil to overwinter until next spring. </P>

<P>My first choice for control would be a product called BioSafe or one of
its cousins.  This is a predatory nematode that feeds on soil born
larvae like grubs or root weevils.  It is essentially harmless to
humans, but if you are a grub, it is a nasty fate to be attacked by
these guys.  Once the soil in your area warms up to about 55 degrees
treat with the Biosafe according to the directions.  This product has
been shown to be effective on a wide range of pests--even fleas!! </P>

<P>Check with your local extension service (in the Government Pages in the
phone book, under state, under Agricultural Extension) for the dates in
your area when eggs are typically lain or when the grubs are likely to
be active.  Treat accordingly. </P>

<P>The nematodes will probably not survive the winter in Indiana and would
need to be applied again. </P>

<P>If that fails to give adequate results, there are a number of pesticides
that would typically be recommended to control these pests.  They
include diazinon or chlorpyrifos--commonly seen as Dursban.  Treat just
after the eggs are laid according to the directions.  The grubs will
come to the surface, usually, and die.  Given the associated hazards to
birds, etc. these products would only be a last resort, in my book. </P>

<P>There are also a group of larvae known as root weevils, often referred to
as "grubs."  My recommendations would be the same, try the Biosafe
type products first and then graduate to harsher pesticides if control
was unsuccessful.  Typically, you could add Orthene (acephate) to the
list particularly for root weevils on Rhododendron.</P>

<P><B>South Texas<BR>
 Dear Whitney Farms -- I live in Houston, TX.  I have a shrub that has become
 infested with spider mites and lace bugs.  The local nursery has
 recommended a strong chemical pesticide to get ride of the little
 critters.  Can you recommend a more "organic" approach?
</P></B>
<P>I usually begin any pest control discussion with a little basic
information about the pests.  Understanding the 'enemy' is fundamental
to controlling them organically. </P>

<P>Many mites are favored by dry weather and a warm environment with
temperatures over 70 degrees, though there are some that like cooler
weather.  Mites are often a problem when there are dusty conditions, or
when plants are stressed for water. </P>

<P>Lacebugs are also most active in warm summer weather, but are a little
harder to control than the mites.  Your email did not indicate which
insect was the bigger problem. </P>

<P>Ironically, often the use of pesticides makes the mite problem worse.
Many mite outbreaks are often caused by the use of pesticides to control
other insects.  Sometimes it is just a matter of killing off the
populations of predatory mites that keep the 'bad guys' in check.  Some
insecticides will actually stimulate the reproductive process mites.
According to one source, mites exposed to carbaryl (SEVIN), methyl
parathion, or dimethoate in the lab reproduce many times faster than
untreated populations.  Carbaryl, some organophosphates, and some
pyrethroids also apparently favor mites by increasing the level of
nitrogen in the leaves--which may be what attracted them to your plant
in the first place.  Additionally, it is well documented that
insecticides applied during hot weather can cause dramatic outbreaks of
mites within a few days. </P>

<P>So, how to control them?  First, I would start by ensuring that all the
cultural needs of the plant are met.  Is the plant getting adequate
water?  Does the soil it is growing in meet its nutritional needs?
Often giving the plant a good watering and then using a rich organic
mulch (preferably compost based) around the plant will help keep the
soil moist and help prevent drought stress that can lead to conditions
that favor the mites.  Mulching can also help reduce the dust level
which removes another condition the mites prefer. </P>

<P>Many gardeners are able to get minor infestations under control using
one of my favorite pesticides--water.  In fact, there is a gentleman
somewhere in your part of the world who has developed a wand
specifically for controlling mites and aphids with a good sharp blast of
water.  Strong enough to knock the mites/aphids down without harming
the plants.  The key is to get good thorough coverage, especially on the
undersides of the leaves.  The principle is simple--on the one hand, the
added humidity will help suppress the mites, and on the other hand, a
mite knocked from your shrub to the ground will not find its way back to
the shrub--they aren't designed to cover that kind of distance.  Try
this a couple of times and see what results you have. </P>

<P>If you need more control, graduate to the insecticidal soaps--like Safer
Insecticidal Soap, by Ringer.  These products get a bad rap, but if used
correctly my experience has been that they are very effective as a
control.  The key is to use them at a time of day that allows them to
stay wet as long as possible.  Spray the plant thoroughly being careful
to get good coverage on the undersides of the leaf where the mites are.
Spray early in the day so the soap solution stays wet as long as
possible--it kills on contact when it is wet.  I am going to guess that
you are going to set the lacebugs back with the soap solution at the
same time you spray for the mites.  One note of caution, if your shrub
is not listed on the soap label, test a small area first before spraying
the entire plant. </P>

<P>If the soap is not working, then I would graduate to the horticultural
oils.  I personally prefer Sunspray Horticultural Oil--it is paraffin
based and seems to be less detrimental to the plants particularly during
periods of warm weather.  Use according to the instructions and again be
sure to get into the undersides of the plant.  Be sure that you are
using a summer rate--some of the oils can also be used during the
dormant season.  One note, some lacebugs overwinter on the plant in a
protected area--those little crooks and crannies into which an insect
could crawl--be sure the spray penetrates into these areas. If the shrub
is deciduous--ie. it loses its leaves in the winter--give it a thorough
dormant spraying with the oil.  This helps to smother any overwintering
insects on the plant.  Other brand names will include Ortho's Volk Oil
or Lilly Millers' Supreme Oil.  These are specially formulated for use
on plants, and when used according to the directions should not be
harmful to the plant.  A couple of tips, be sure the plant is watered
and is not stressed before you spray it.  I have seen a lot of plants
damaged by well meaning care takers who sprayed them when they were dry
and under drought stress.  Generally, you end up with one burnt plant! </P>

<P>You might have to try one of the above techniques a couple times.
Remember, organic pest control is not a "final solution"--pests are not
eradicated, they are controlled.  The idea is to create conditions that
allow nature to get the pest under control and reestablish the natural
system of checks and balances.  It is not possible to completely
eliminate the pest from the environment.  Better to get it under control
and to a point where you can live with it rather than to use an endless
supply of nasty pesticides in a futile quest for CLEAN plants. </P>

<P>Very unlikely to control the mites, but possibly effective on the
lacebugs is a pesticide commonly known as Neem.  Available under various
formulations it is derived from the seed pod of the neem tree and acts
as an insect growth regulator.  To be effective, the insect must be in a
growth stage and not already a mature adult.  I have not found specific
references to the lacebug, but I would be inclined to try it.  It has
been shown to be effective on a pretty wide range of insects. </P>

<P>From here your options include the pyrethroids--botanically derived
insecticides which are often approved for use by organic certifying
organizations.  These are still potent pesticides and should be used
with caution.  The advantage is that they break down very quickly in the
environment.  Again, follow the instructions on the label. </P>

<P>If you have tried all of the methods mentioned above and are still
plagued by the pests, it might be time to go for the big guns.  I always
advise folks at this point to ask yourself one question.  Will I have to
always use these chemicals if I am to grow this plant in my yard?  If
the answer is yes, then do you really want or have to grow this
particular shrub?  I know it is a difficult question, but I think it is
a legitimate one.  There are a lot of plants out there, and there might
be one better suited to the environmental conditions in your yard
than the one you have now.  Please understand, I am not suggesting that
you go out and tear out your favorite shrub.  Just ask yourself if you
are setting yourself up for an endless struggle to bend nature to your
will--it can be a long and disappointing road.  (FACT:  We use more
pesticides today than we have in the history of human agriculture, and
yet we continue to lose almost the same amount of crops to insects as we
did prior to the introduction of pesticides...Makes you wonder...) </P>

<P>So, the philosophical digression aside, if you have reached the point
where none of the low impact methods have brought you any results, then
it is time to graduate to the next level.  For the mites, you do have
some reasonably low toxicity, pest specific acaricides (mite killers)
available--like Avid.  The trouble will be finding them in a consumer
package--it is very expensive by the quart in the commercial
formulation.  My guess is, however, that the mites will be easier to
control than the lacebugs.  If that is the case, you could use
Orthene--a local systemic by Ortho--or Isotox--the latter used to be
Orthene plus a miticide like Avid.  I had heard rumors that Ortho was
discontinuing the Isotox formulation.  But check your local nursery for
it.  With the obvious effects that carbaryl/Sevin has on the mites (see
above)--I would not even consider using it. </P>

<P>I hope that I have been able to answer your question.  You should be
able to CONTROL your pests organically.  Begin with cultural changes
that will help to reduce the mite problem, and work up from there. </P>

<P>A PS. of sorts--There are quite a few predatory mites available mail
order.  Once you get things under control, you might consider releasing
some of those into your yard to reduce the chance of problems in the
future.  And finally, on a philosophical note, think about how to
correct the conditions that brought about the problem--that is the best
long term solution!</P>

<P><B>Prescott, AZ<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms --  I'm a 1st time organic gardener..formerly from PDX & Eugene.
I have a huge plot with both flowers & veggies starting,
 what can I do to keep away aphids from my roses but not
poison myself in the process!?</P></B>
<P>I have great news for you!  Aphids are one of the easiest pests to
control organically!  In fact, the biggest challenge to controling
aphids organically is the patience required to allow nature to assert
its own controls over these pesky little plant pests.
</P>
<P>First a couple of things about aphids that are really cool!  Did you
know that aphids bear live young?  Yep, the females can actually clone
themselves--hence the incredibly quick pace with which they appear in
your garden and infest your roses.  They are also what some have called
the "cows" of the insect world, as they excrete a sweet liquid commonly
called honeydew.  This is actually harvested by ants as a food source.
In fact, the ants will often help to get the aphids evenly distributed
on your roses so they can get the most out of them!  Finally, when the
population reaches a particular density, individuals with wings begin to
appear so that they can migrate to your neighbors garden!  (I love this
stuff--insects never cease to amaze me with all the ways they have
adapted to the world they live in!) </P>

<P>The good news is that you do not have to get the toxics out to get the
aphids under control.  As a great article in the latest (May/June) issue
of Organic Gardening (highly recommended to recent converts to the
organic gardening fold) notes, the first stept to getting these guys
under control is to get the ants under control.  Strategies suggested in
the article include ringing your plants with coffee grounds (which worms
love by the way) to repel the ants--never heard of this before, but I am
going to try it this spring--and if you find the nests, dousing them
with boiling water poured over the nest very slowly so it has a chance
to seep in--this I have tried and can attest to its effectiveness. </P>

<P>Now the hard part.  The aphid population will take off once they arrive
in your garden, as you probably have noticed.  Provided you have
controlled the ants--who defend their insect nectaries
ferociously--mother natures' natural aphid predators will move in and
make a quick meal of the aphids. </P>

<P>If you'd like, you can give your roses a blast with a good sharp stream
of water.  Obviously not a technique to use when they are blooming, it
is however very effective.  Aphids are not the most mobile creatures,
and once knocked to the ground, will not find their way back to the
tender new tips of your roses.  In fact, I would imagine that in the hot
summer days of Pheonix they will whither and die quite quickly.  The
water will also be appreciated by the roses, and the increased humidity
can help to prevent mites.  I would suggest giving your roses their bath
in the morning, so the foliage can dry off as the day warms up.  Please,
exercise caution--don't get so carried away with the desire to rid your
plants of the aphids that you blast them into oblivion.  Use just enough
pressure to knock the little aphids off the plants and to the ground.
Also, don't get carried away trying to get every last aphid.  The idea
is to get the population in check while you wait for the reinforcements. </P>

<P>If you are patient, and resist the impulse to SPRAY pesticides, you will
get to witness one of the great dramas of nature--predation.  All kinds
of insects eat aphids--ladybugs, green lacewings, hover fly's, and
others--and some wasps actually lay their eggs in the aphids creating
little aphid mummys.  (Take a look with your hand lense or magnifying
glass, and you will see little brown aphid domes with tiny little holes
in them where the wasp crawled out of the aphid.) </P>

<P>Unfortunately, all too often folks get the malathion out and give the
aphids a good spraying not realizing that at the same time, they are
killing all the natural predators of the aphids.  This often leads to
much worse infestations because the natural check on the aphids has been
wiped out! </P>

<P>You can even introduce your own beneficials.  Lady bugs are OK, but the
real killers are green lacewings.  These suckers eat aphids like sushi!
A couple of green lacewings will wipe out 100s of aphids in a short
time.  And all you have to do is sit back and watch. </P>

<P>If mother nature is slow to respond, you can intervene with some fairly
safe products.  Look for Safer's Insecticidal Soap.  Unlike the liquid
ivory under the kitchen sink, this is a product derived from natural
fatty acids that has been formulated to control insect pests on plants
and tested extensively on a wide range of plants.  It is virtually non
toxic to us--watch the eyes, follow the label, etc.  A couple of points
about getting the most out of it.  1)  It only kills on contact while it
is wet.  So be sure to apply it early in the morning so that it can stay
wet as long as possible. 2)  Its effectiveness can be reduced by hard
water, so you might have to adjust for that.  But it works--if you use
it correctly!! </P>

<P>A last resort if things get really out of hand would be the family of
"botanical" insecticides used by organic gardeners pyrethrum, rotenone or
sabadilla.  Seriously though, you shouldn't need to use these.  I find
that if I am just patient, the birds and insect predators clean the
aphids off my roses (in Stumptown/aka the City of Roses/aka Portland,
OR).  Typically, I see the aphids have arrived; tell myself to be
patient; finally decide its time to get the soap out and blast the
suckers; get up early in the morning; mix the spray solution, and head
out to do battle only to find that there is not an aphid in sight!  Upon
close examination, I find the culprit--the overstuffed lady bug larva
resting in the morning sun.  EGAD!!  Stop me before I spray again! </P>

<P>Hope I gave you some inspiration to resist the temptation to get the
chemical nasties out!  DON'T DO IT!  But I would check your local
newsstand for the latest issue of Organic Gardening!  You can read up on
the pests and their predators, and rest a little easier knowing that you
have mother nature in your corner.  She is one heck of an ally!!</P>

<P><B>On March 14, you wrote asking about diseases and pests on Cornus sp.
(Dogwood). Here are some common diseases of Cornus sp.:</P></B>
<BR>
Dogwood Anthracnose (Gloeosporium sp.)<BR>
Phytophthora<BR>
Powdery Mildew (Phyllactina corylea)<BR>
Botryisphaeria ribis<BR>
Common insect pests of Cornus sp. include:<BR>
Dogwood borer (Synanthedon scitula)<BR>
Leafhoppers<BR>
<P>This is not a comprehensive list, just the most common pests associated with
dogwoods.</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- What ever happened to a product called Black
Leaf 40? I believe it was a tobacco extract. It
was the only pesticide I ever used and I didn't
even use it as pest (killer). I sprayed only small
areas of newly planted, very tender seedlings just
to keep the "pests" at bay until the seedlings got
going. In an organic light, how would you rate the
efficacy of tobacco extracts as pesticides?</B></P>
 <P>I checked with a couple of buyers at retail nurseries on the west coast and
they said that they had not seen it available for some time.  The question
is, was it removed from sale in all states by the EPA or just from the
states with more stringent regulations like California.  Another possibility
is that the registration expired and the manufacturer did not want to
reregister the product due to costs associated with the process and the very
low sales volume for the item (I used to sell Black Leaf 40 at a very large,
high volume independent nursery in Santa Cruz, CA and it was one of the
slowest items I had--and we were the largest dealer in Safers' Soap--so it
wasn't for lack of organically minded customers.)  Both buyers (one in
Oregon and one in California) thought that you could probably find some
floating around, though that would depend on how long (and if) it had been
off of the market.  (In fact, while checking some numbers for the second
part of this answer, I found no manufacturer listed for the United States)</P>

<P>As to your question about efficacy, that is the one concern I had when I
used to handle the product.  It may be too effective!  It is an extremely
toxic substance with an oral LD50 (the lethal dose to kill 50% of a given
test population) of only 50 mg/kg.  In fact, the lethal dose for a human is
only 50 mg--the equivalent of the nicotine contained in two cigarettes (It's
a good thing most of the nicotine is destroyed by burning!)  To put that
into perspective, the oral LD50 for Diazinon is 66, Malathion 885!  The
point being, that because something falls into the organic family by
definition it is not necessarily less toxic or less dangerous. (Pyrethrin's
LD50 is 200, rotenone 60)  It also has a fairly high dermal toxicity.</P>

<P>This is not to say that it did not work!  In my experience it was very
effective!  Just use it with caution!!  Follow the precautions on the label
and wear protective gear!  Respirator, goggles, protective clothing at the
minimum.</P>
<P><B>A soil test suggested no P and no K (sample quite
high in these) and 1 to 2 Pounds of ACTUAL N.</P>
