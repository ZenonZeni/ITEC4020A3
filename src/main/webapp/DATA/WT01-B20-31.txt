<p align="center"><b>Prohibition Establishment Attacks NORML
&amp; Capricorn Records<br>
For The Debut Of The Long-Awaited HEMPILATION Release</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN &amp; Washington,
D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Last week marked the first time ever that a major
recording label has released a benefit compilation of popular
musicians that will benefit the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).&nbsp; Available in music stores around
the nation, Capricorn Records' HEMPILATION contains major music
recording stars: Blues Traveler, The Black Crowes, Cypress Hill,
Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, Gov.'t Mule and twelve other
musical acts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We want people to think about freedom,&quot; explains Allen
St. Pierre of NORML.&nbsp; &quot;This is why the CD's subtitle is
'Freedom is NORML'.&nbsp; Participating artists view HEMPILATION
as a permanent, musical means of expressing their joint concerns
about the unfair restriction on Americans' civil liberties posed
by long standing government anti-marijuana efforts and a public statement
of their support for NORML. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On September 29, the Associated Press (AP) reported that
extremist anti-marijuana groups have already vowed to protest
HEMPILATION'S release.&nbsp; Devout prohibitionist Joseph
Califano, head of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA) at Columbia University, told AP, &quot;Why anyone would
want to take something that's dangerous and damaging and
encourage children to use it is beyond me.&quot;&nbsp; NORML's
Allen St. Pierre responds: &quot;I wish that Mr. Califano would
stop misrepresenting NORML's mission statement.&nbsp; For 25
years NORML has never advocated that anyone, especially children,
should use marijuana.&nbsp; NORML advocates that adults should
not face criminal or civil penalties for the use and possession
of marijuana in their homes.&nbsp; If Mr. Califano is truly
concerned about the welfare of today's children and 'pro-drug'
messages in our society, I strongly suggest that Mr. Califano
should begin by loudly advocating the prohibition of the
semi-pornographic beer commercials that litter professional and
collegiate sporting events aired on television.&nbsp; It's clear
that alcohol and tobacco are, by any measure, the two drugs that
Mr. Califano and his group should be focusing on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other prohibition groups such as the Atlanta-based Parents
Resources and Information on Drug Education (PRIDE) and the
Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council have indicated
that they would like to force this music off the market in a way
similar to their attempts to ban explicit rap music. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Freedom Of Speech Is Affirmed In Canada<br>
NORML Canada Wins Significant Court Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 28, King City, Ontario:</b>&nbsp; A
three-year legal struggle to allow citizens of Canada to have the
freedom to purchase and read literature that describes or depicts
&quot;illicit drug use&quot; has been won by Umberto Iorfida of
Canada NORML.&nbsp; In a letter to Iorfida's attorney, The
Attorney General (Ministry of Justice) indicates that the
Canadian government has decided not to appeal the decision handed
down on October 4, 1994 by the then Ontario Supreme Court [now
called the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division].&nbsp;
That decision removed from the Criminal Code offensive language
that made &quot;literature&quot; such as: NORML publications,
High Times magazine, HEMP BC catalogs, Jack Herer's &quot;The
Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot; and a myriad of other popular
published works illegal in Canada. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Madame Justice Ellen McDonald determined the inclusion of
&quot;literature&quot; in the Criminal Code to be inconsistent
with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms [The equivalent to the
United States' Bill of Rights--ed.] and unjustifiable in a free
and democratic society. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With this case finally put to rest, Iorfida and NORML Canada are
now going to focus all of their attention on defeating Bill
C-7.&nbsp; This legislation seeks to enhance the criminal
penalties in marijuana-related cases. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on NORML Canada's victory or information

800 Pounds Of Marijuana</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 20, Columbia, MO:</b>&nbsp; The
State of Missouri recently purchased 800 pounds of hemp,
otherwise known as marijuana through the Missouri affiliate of
NORML.&nbsp; The hemp is in the form of four 200 pound bales
which are being used as part of an exhibit at the Visitors'
Center of the Battle of Lexington State Historic Site.&nbsp; The
bales were made to the specifications of the Historic Site. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Battle of Lexington (also known as the Battle of the Hemp
Bales) took place in September of 1861.&nbsp; Approximately 3000
federal soldiers from Chicago looted the bank and created a makeshift
earthwork fort.&nbsp; Twenty thousand Missouri volunteers engaged
the federal troops.&nbsp; A three day siege of the fort led to a
stand-off until the Missourians had the idea of using the
recently harvested hemp bales as a moving defense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With water soaked hemp bales (to prevent the fire red hot
grapeshot from burning the hemp bales), the Missourians, firing
over the hemp bales, rolled them forward toward the fort and
carried the day, defeating the federal troops. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan Viets, said, &quot;NORML is proud
to be of service to The State of Missouri in this regard and
pleased to be able to contribute to a greater understanding of the

agricultural resource for the State of Missouri today.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>School Board In Pennsylvania Votes To
Include &quot;Publications&quot; As Drug Paraphernalia</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, Octorara, PA:</b>&nbsp; By a 6-2
vote, the Octorara Area School Board adopted a policy that
enables school officials to suspend students for 10 days and
notify local police if student is caught on school grounds with &quot;publications
about drugs&quot; wrote a report in The Intelligencer Journal
(IJ). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to school administrators, the policy is needed because
&quot;publications ... brought to school have dealt with how to
grow marijuana and manufacture hallucinogenic drugs,&quot;
reported The New Era newspaper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While the vote to adopt the policy prevailed, strong opposition
was voiced by School Board Member John Addyman who was quoted in
the IJ as saying, &quot;I have a real problem saying a publication
should be banned.&quot;&nbsp; Addyman said when he took a seat on
the school board he swore to uphold the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;
&quot;That Constitution guarantees the right of free
speech,&quot; Addyman said.&nbsp; William Iacone, director of
special services, said administrators hope to target publications which
promote drugs by telling how to cultivate, buy, sell, use or
manufacture illegal drugs --and in some case, where to get
them.&nbsp; &quot;This is not freedom of speech,&quot; Iacone
said to the IJ. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also opposing the new policy was school board attorney, Alan
Jarvis.&nbsp; He told the IJ that publications are &quot;a tender
area&quot; of the law and cautioned the board on calling publications
drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; He said the policy might be
challenged.&nbsp; Despite Mr. Jarvis' reservations of the legality
of the board's actions, other board members chimed in: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - &quot;Leave it in [the policy change] and be
    challenged,&quot; said board member Sam Gasnow.&nbsp;
    &quot;That's what's right.&quot;&nbsp; Gasnow also asserted
    that students &quot;have no First Amendment rights in the
    classroom.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Board member Lawrence Gibbs [who supports the change in
    policy]: &quot;Why don't we stop by the library after the
    meeting.&nbsp; There may be a few books I want to get out of
    here.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Also, Superintendent Tom Sholvin commented, &quot;Today the
    right thing and the legal thing aren't always the same
    things.&nbsp; Our intent is not to take away anybody's rights.&quot;

Annual Rally</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 23, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; MASS CANN
NORML drew over 30,000 peaceful pot protesters to its Sixth
Annual Rally To End Cannabis Prohibition. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With great fall weather and a terrific line up of speakers and
musical acts the Boston Common turned into a sea of protest
against America's prohibition of the cannabis plant.&nbsp;
&quot;The purpose of the rally was to press home to the people
and their representatives on Beacon Hill that our grievance is
the absolute prohibition of marijuana; even to the chronically or
terminally ill,&quot; said MASSCANN: NORML chairperson Attorney
Steve Epstein. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The event was well received by the New England media (and The
Economist magazine) and the Boston police.&nbsp; Only seven
arrests on cannabis-related charges were reported.&nbsp; A NORML activist
in attendance solicited some police officers for their thoughts
on the whole event.&nbsp; The officers commented that they were
really glad that the 30,000 protesters were predominantly consuming
cannabis--and not alcoholic beverages! <br>

<p align="center"><b>Another U.S. Judge Advocates Legalizing
Drugs: 'We're Losing The War On Drugs'</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN:</b>&nbsp; Joining
more than 60 other Federal judges, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Wiseman spoke up in opposition to this country's &quot;war on
drugs&quot; in an interview with The Tennessean.&nbsp; Judge
Wiseman said that &quot;We've spent $100 billion on the war on
drugs and we're losing it.&quot;&nbsp; Wiseman recommends that
the U.S. should legalize drugs.&nbsp; That, he says, is the only
real way to win the war.&nbsp; &quot;If you take the profit out
of it, nobody will be pushing it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wiseman, a 17 year veteran of the federal bench, said that when
President Bush escalated the war on drugs in 1989 [Omnibus Crime
Bill, Asset Forfeiture, DARE educational programs, Partnership
for a Drug Free (sic) America, Mandatory minimum prison
sentences, etc. ... -ed.], the country not only lost the battle,
but also, &quot;We've just about lost a generation of young
people,&quot; he told The Tennessean.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Good News: Seattle Area's Green Cross
Patient Co-op Court Case Is Dropped</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Bainbridge Island, WA:</b>&nbsp;
The Seattle Times reports: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There is good news and bad news for Joanna McKee and her Green
Cross Patient Coop, busted earlier this year for supplying what
McKee says is 'medicinal marijuana' to people she describes as
patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The good news is that Kitsap County Superior Court Judge Leonard
Kruse threw out the search warrant used in a May raid when police
seized 162 marijuana plants from McKee's home.&nbsp; &quot;If the
warrant's no good, then all the evidence is out.&nbsp; If the
evidence is out, then we have no case to prosecute,&quot; said
Deputy Prosecutor Kevin Kelly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bad news for McKee is that it doesn't look like the county
plans to return her marijuana, estimated by drug enforcement
officials to be worth $300,000.&nbsp; McKee -- the first
medicinal marijuana supplier [Cannabis Buyer's Club--ed.] in the
country to be busted, according to NORML -- said she's going to
take Kitsap County to court.&nbsp; About 70 patients with AIDS, multiple
sclerosis, cancer and other illnesses ... depended on Green Cross
for marijuana ... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We were not convicted of a crime, and they have no right to
take our medicine away.&nbsp; They said they took $300,000 worth
of medicine away from us.&nbsp; I think they owe us
$300,000,&quot; said McKee.</p>

<p align="center"><b>The Dutch Government Modifies Its Drug
Policy<br>
Pressure Felt From Neighboring Countries</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 25, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
Dutch government announced some revisions of their progressive
drug policy at a news conference held at the National Press
Club.&nbsp; State-Secretary for the Interior, Jacob Kohnstamm, presented
to the U.S. press (what little there was assembled! -ed.] a list
of changes that the Dutch government are seeking to implement in
the coming years.&nbsp; While some of these changes may be viewed
by some as an abdication by the Dutch of the progressive drug
policies established in the 1970's, Secretary Kohnstamm was quick to
point out that The Netherlands is not abandoning its defacto
legalization of small amounts of cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Due to strong pressure from its neighboring countries (especially
France), The Netherlands seek to compromise with its neighbors
while still championing the social, public health, and criminal justice
benefits that it believes its drug policy presents. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Secretary Kohnstamm indicated that policy changes concerning
cannabis are: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The sale of cannabis products in &quot;coffee shops&quot;
    will be reduced from 30 grams per purchase to 5 grams, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -There will be a 50% reduction of the number of &quot;coffee
    shops&quot;, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The state will begin to combat the large-scale production of
    cannabis in the Netherlands, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Netherlands will also seek to establish a more active
    policy on the deportation of &quot;drug tourists&quot; and
    addicts residing illegally in the Netherlands. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Kohnstamm reiterated that the citizens and the government of
the Netherlands strongly support their drug policy.&nbsp; When
asked by an American reporter, &quot;Why don't the Dutch adopt a drug
policy similar to America's war on drugs approach?&quot; Mr.
Kohnstamm said that such a policy is considered a complete
failure in the minds of the Dutch.&nbsp; He cited the latest
statistics from both the U.S. and the Netherlands concerning the
prevalence of cannabis use amongst teens to make his case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Netherlands (where cannabis sales are tolerated) the rate
of teens admitting to using cannabis is: 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 13% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Last 30 days = 6% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    As compared to the United States (where there is a total
    prohibition on cannabis): <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 28% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Last 30 days = 14%
