<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Defining Motivation to Learn</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#SB">Susan Braen</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
Brophy (1987) defines motivation as either a trait, an enduring disposition to strive for content knowledge and skill mastery in learning situations, or a state in which student engagement in a particular activity is guided by the intention of acquiring the knowledge or skill that the activity is designed to teach. There are, however, other interpretations to the meaning of motivation.<BR>
<BR>
Corno (1992), for example, reports on a study by Hansen (1989) in which students were presented with assignments which were considered to be confusing or boring. While some students withdrew from productive engagement, others used coping mechanisms to clarify the assignment and persisted in their attempts to complete the assignment.<BR>
<BR>
These behaviors suggest, according to Corno, that there are complex social and cognitive factors besides motivation which influence a student's learning behavior. She concludes that these may be volitional processes such as assuming responsibility for learning and regulating concentration, behavior, and affect. Corno believes that these are elements of a class of student processes which is required for learning and that is distinct from motivation. These volitional activities are thought to be different from either affective elements such as liking or enjoying an activity or cognitive elements such as using learning strategies for accomplishing the intended goal.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation</H3>

Students are expected to engage themselves in the learning process by implementing purposeful learning activities (1) such as choosing challenging educational goals, employing various self-regulatory learning strategies (2), and having failure tolerance in order to master the goal. However, many students appear unwilling or unable to focus their attentions toward learning mastery, choosing rather to select less challenging goals, employing minimal learning strategies, and quitting when unable to meet the goal easily. These differing student behaviors toward learning activities and goals are classified as resulting from either intrinsic or extrinsic motivational orientations. (3)<BR>
<BR>
A student who is intrinsically motivated approaches educational activities as meaningful for the sake of the learning itself. The student selects mastery goals through which he or she can improve competence, understand or expand personal knowledge, or achieve personal mastery. There is a sense that effort leads to success. Learning strategies include the employment of methods to manage the learning by breaking the task into smaller manageable goals which enables the student to be incrementally successful. These successes reinforce persistence with the overall task. There is additionally a sense of pride in accomplishing one's goals. However, failure is often attributed to inadequate effort.<BR>
<BR>
In contrast, students with an extrinsic orientation to learning are more likely to choose performance goals which can be accomplished easily, with minimal effort. The student's focus is not on the learning but on demonstrating competence compared to that of others. Success is frequently attributed to being more clever than others, pulling one over on the teacher, or on being lucky. A student with a performance goal orientation requires success for a sense of self-worth. Since failure is very damaging to this type of student's ego and these students also tend to use very limited learning strategies, they are very likely to quit making the effort if initially unsuccessful or if the task appears too daunting.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Summary</H3>

	Intrinsic motivation is contrasted with extrinsic motivation as being characterized by a student's being concerned with mastery rather than comparing ability with others', learning for the sake of learning rather than performance, and being involved with the task rather than a concern with one's ego. Students with an intrinsic motivation also believe that effort and success covary while those students with an extrinsic motivational orientation choose easier goals requiring less effort or use effort minimizing strategies such as getting help from others, copying, or guessing.<BR>
