The Purpose of CEC Clubs<P>
</B>The overall purpose of CEC Clubs is to promote future leaders in the education of children and youth with exceptionalities as well as promote programs designed to inform students of special education and to encourage them to become involved with their peers with the possible result of becoming a part of the profession of special education in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Benefits of Starting a CEC Club</B><BR>
<BR>
Consider the benefits of  starting a CEC Club. Check those that apply to your situation:<P>
<B>_     Recruit future special education teachers</B> -- Future professionals in the field of special education are recruited through CEC clubs.  Club members gain experience and knowledge about special education which may direct their future goals. <BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Build Peer Relationships</B> -- CEC Clubs provide students with an avenue to modify the perceptions they have of their peers.  As club members work on projects and learning activities, they become more aware of the abilities and similarities they have with their peers.  Students in these inclusive environments build self-esteem, socialize, and make friends.<BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Provide Community Service</B> -- Working to inform the community of the Americans with Disabilities Act or to make restaurants, parks, entertainment facilities and city buildings more accessible to all citizens, allows Club members to become community advocates.<BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Enhance Educational Outcomes</B> -- Serving as peer partners provides mutual benefits to Club members and their partners as they learn, work, and play together.   Students involved in peer partner programs develop positive attitudes towards themselves, others, and their school and home environments because they are finding a sense of  belonging.<BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Foster Public Awareness</B> -- Planning and implementing projects and activities creates public awareness and enhance the image of special education.  Holding a disability awareness day, learning about individuals with exceptionalities, and making and supporting friends with disabilities all help to create advocates who value the abilities and diversity of their peers.<BR>

Support For CEC Clubs</B><BR>
<BR>
CEC Clubs became part of The Council for Exceptional Children in 1975 at the CEC Delegate Assembly.  From 1975-1980 there were nine clubs. The support for CEC Clubs sparked in 1989 when the Ohio Department of Special Education provided a grant to develop Project Support, a program to train high school students to become peer tutors.  Since then, the number of clubs has grown rapidly.  In 1990 there were 16 clubs and in August 1993 there were 40 clubs.  Currently, these clubs are located in nine different states and include approximately 900 members.<P>
The Council for Exceptional Children is the largest international organization that advocates for students with disabilities as well as those who are gifted and talented.  CEC has approximately 53,000 members and more than 11,500 of these are college students who have chosen a career in special education.  Many are interested in working with CEC Club members.<P>
CEC provides the latest information in the field of special education, advocates for students with special needs, and actively recruits and retains professionals in the field of special education.  This is not all that CEC has to offer, but these are three areas where CEC can enhance it Clubs.<P>
<B>CEC has the latest information in special education.</B>  Through <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> and <I>CEC Today</I>, club members can discover activities that are being sponsored on college campuses, what first-year teachers are saying about their experiences in the classroom, what other CEC Clubs are doing, and how they can promote accessibility within their school.<P>
<B>CEC advocates for students with special needs.</B>  Through one-on-one and group experiences with individuals with exceptionalities, CEC Club members will discover the abilities, similarities, and the importance of acceptance and inclusion of exceptional individuals.   As friendships are established, club members will feel more confident when promoting disability awareness to their peers and begin to include and support students with exceptionalities. <P>
<B>CEC recruits and retains professionals in the field of special education.</B>  As you may know from your own involvement with special education, volunteering and hands on experience is important.  CEC is involved with the National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education which has developed a number of resource sheets on various aspects of special education, along with resources in financial assistance, university training programs, and volunteer experiences.  Club members can stay involved in CEC as they enter college -- there are approximately 340 college and university CEC chapters.  Students do not have to be preparing for a special education career to join Student CEC.<P>
Affiliating with an international program will give your club validity.  There will be many other local and state/provincial level programs with similar activities.  By becoming involved with CEC and setting professional goals and objectives, people will begin to understand the value of a club and the benefits offered to student members.  Your CEC Club will also have the opportunity to be included in CEC state/provincial-sponsored programs.
