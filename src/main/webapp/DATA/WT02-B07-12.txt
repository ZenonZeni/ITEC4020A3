(1) Congress Passes Online Indecency Bill, Clinton Expected to Sign, 
    CDT Plans Court Challenge

By overwhelming margins in both the House and Senate, Congress today (2/1) approved 
legislation to dramatically restrict the First Amendment rights of Internet users.  
With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally available today 
in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on World Wide Web sites or 
usenet newsgroups. If signed by President Clinton as expected, this bill will transform 
the Internet overnight from the freest communications medium to the most heavily 
regulated medium in the United States. 

CDT believes this legislation is unconstitutional. We are committed to challenging 
it in the courts at the earliest possible opportunity.

Despite the sustained effort over the past 12 months by Senators Leahy (D-VT), 
Feingold (D-WI), and Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), Rick White (R-WA), and Ron 
Wyden (D-OR) to defeat the bill, the House passed the measure on a vote of 414 - 16, 
while the Senate concurred a few hours later on a vote of 91 - 5. Ironically, the 
vote comes exactly one year to the day that Senator Exon (D-NE) originally introduced 
the proposal (2/1/95).

CONGRESS MAKES CRIMINALS OF MOST INTERNET USERS

The Communications Decency Act, enacted as part of a massive telecommunications 
reform legislation, will impose $250,000 fines and prison terms for anyone who 
posts "indecent" material, including the "7 dirty words", the text of classic 
works of fiction such as The Catcher In The Rye or Ulysses, artwork containing 
images of nudes, or rap lyrics, in a public forum. 

CDT strongly opposes this legislation. We believe the bill threatens the very 
existence of the Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political 
discourse. The bill is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by the Federal 
government into the private lives of all Americans. 

Although the free speech rights of Internet users and the free flow of information 
online received a major setback today, the battle is far from over.  President Clinton 
is expected to sign the legislation in the coming days.  Several civil liberties and 
public interest advocacy groups, including CDT, People for the American Way, EFF, and 
the ACLU are already preparing to challenge these new restrictions in court.  Other 
affected entities, including commercial content providers, Internet Service Providers, 
and the commercial online services industries, are also expected to mount court 
challenges to this legislation.  CDT is confident that the courts will find the 
Communications Decency Act unconstitutional and reject it outright.

INTERNET COMMUNITY ACTIVISM MADE A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE

Although the CDA passed by Congress today represents a significant threat to the 
viability of the Internet and the free speech rights of individual users, the 
efforts of the Internet.community to mobilize against the bill kept it from being 
a lot worse.  

The Christian Coalition, with the support of House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde (R-IL), fought hard to hold online service providers criminally liable 
for materials generated by their subscribers. Fortunately, these efforts were not 
successful. Holding providers liable would have forced them to pre-screen all 
material on their networks, or, worse yet, shut down entire parts of their services 
for fear of massive fines and prison sentences. The Christian Coalition was also 
unsuccessful in their efforts to remove provisions encouraging the development and 
deployment of parental control applications. 

Due to the efforts of the 115,000 Internet users who signed the petition against 
the CDA, the more than 20,000 users who in one day flooded Congress with phone 
calls, faxes, and email messages, and those who throughout 1995 regularly called 
their Congresspeople to express concerns about the various proposals, the Internet 
community showed itself to be a true political force with real influence over the 
legislative process.  Although we did not accomplish all of our most important 
objectives, we have become a powerful force.  This is not the last time Congress 
will consider issues vital to the interests of Internet users across the United 
States. We must never loose sight of the fact that, despite the apparent defeat 
today, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.

SEVERAL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF INTERNET USERS

Although a majority of Congress today demonstrated a complete lack of understanding 
of the Internet and the implications of the Communications Decency Act, several 
members deserve credit for standing up for freedom of speech and the free flow of 
information online.  

During the course of the debate over the last year on the CDA, Senators Patrick 
Leahy (D-VT) and Russ Feingold (D-WI), along with Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), 
Rick White (R-WA), Michael Oxley (R-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA), 
showed courage and conviction by working to support enlightened alternatives to 
government content restrictions.  These members have shown themselves to be friends 
of the Internet, and we look forward to working with them on other issues which lie 
ahead.

ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT PASSED TODAY

The legislation approved today was not changed from a previous version released 
December 21, 1995 (See CDT Policy Post No. 33).  Briefly, the proposal contains 
several troubling elements.  Among other things, the bill: 

* Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency" 
  standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))

* Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making 
  indecent material available for display in a manner available to a 
  minor (including World Wide Web pages, ftp sites, or usenet 
  newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).

* No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill 
  prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the  
  Internet or other interactive media.

* Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial 
  activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers 
  (Sec 502 (h)).

* Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer, 
  the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec 
  508).

The full text of the bill, along with other relevant background information 
(including final vote tallies when available) can be found at CDT's Internet 
Censorship Issues Web Page (http://www.cdt.org/cda.html).

As CDT prepares to fight this issue in court, we will continue to update you on 
our progress as information becomes available.
