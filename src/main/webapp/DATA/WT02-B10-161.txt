The Department of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry at the New York State Psychiatric Institute is responsible for approximately 500 medical students in six  affiliated hospitals including New York State Psychiatric Institute and Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Harlem Hospital Center, and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. We supervise a teaching curriculum at the Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons that extends throughout the four years of medical school on a year round basis. The department is also responsible for helping to develop the whole medical school curriculum. We also are generating research in medical education-organization, curriculum, and the developmental processes of medical students in their training. The division is administered by Dr. Eric R. Marcus, Director, Dr. Janis Cutler, Associate Director, and Ms. Edith White, Administrator. Program development and the organization of teaching and research are done by the central staff. The teaching is done by the full-time and voluntary faculty of the Department of Psychiatry. Because we are one of the largest teaching departments of psychiatry in the world, we are able to offer teaching programs of a wide range and considerable depth.

<B>Undergraduate Psychiatry Curriculum</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first-year course in psychiatry at the medical school begins with psychopathology. Although this is heuristically illogical, the research in our division has shown that medical students' identification with physicians starts very early in their training and is the major motivating factor for their learning. Therefore, clinical psychiatrists teach this course, the students see patients immediately, and the focus is on illness. The course thereby provides students with one of their first introductions to patient care and to the general principles of interviewing. This course was rated outstanding for the fourth year in a row and in the past few years has been one of the highest rated courses in the first year of medical school.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second-year course continues the teaching of psychopathology, adds a developmental context and, in addition, provides an introduction to different types of therapy. Students continue to see patients. Small group discussion follows every lecture. This year, the end of the course coincided with Department of Medicine courses on medical interviewing and physical examination. The students therefore received a combined psychiatric-medicine experience integrating information in techniques in the two fields. The student ratings for this course continue to be higher than ever before.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our third-year psychiatry clerkship, five weeks in length, remains our most intensively supervised course and is the most demanding of faculty time. Student ratings consistently place it among the highest of the clinical clerkships at the medical school. Because of changes in hospital services, this course has required continued administrative attention to keep the quality of the experience high. This year, Dr. Joel Solomon revamped third-year teaching at St. Luke's-Roosevelt and Henry McCurtis made changes at Harlem Hospital. These changes were enthusiastically received by the students and faculty. Affiliated hospital teaching sites have struggled to do their best amidst the health care funding crisis. A major part of our job this year has been to rally enthusiastic support among full-time and voluntary faculty so that teaching remains a high priority.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our fourth-year electives continue to provide the broadest range of experience in clinical and research psychiatry. The electives attract top Columbia students as well as students from other medical schools around the country and the world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, having successfully won a large Robert Wood Johnson Medical Education grant, has entirely reshaped the first two years of the medical school curriculum providing a model for American medical education in the 21st century. The new curriculum involves broadening the base of medical education from the basic medical sciences to include epidemiological sciences and the human behavioral sciences. The new curriculum attempts to integrate all three sciences with clinical work beginning in the first year. The Department of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry has played a major role in providing relevant pedagogical theory, in organizing subsections of teaching, and in implementing the teaching program of this demonstration project. This new curriculum is now in its second year and has been greeted with great excitement by the faculty and students. As part of that new effort, we participated in the development of a new clerkship in family practice which started this year most successfully. In addition, a mentoring program was started to provide on-going support to students during their medical school years.

<B>Research Projects</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Research focusing on the emotional process of becoming a doctor continued with application to the curriculum of knowledge about student identification processes. We are using this research information to plan course content, sequence, and pedagogical style. Research was also begun in exploring the reasons for and against career choice in psychiatry by medical students. Research was also begun on substance abuse epidemiology among medical, dental, and nursing students.

<B>Awards</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Cutler won an award as outstanding woman doctor of the year from the American Medical Women's Association branch at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also won the American Psychiatric Association's Roeske Certificate of Excellence in medical student education.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Outcome measures of the education program remain high with students performing above average on national board exams, with student reviews of courses in psychiatry in the excellent to outstanding range.
