<H2> UNIQUE TREASURE </H2>

<p>  JATOBA TEA is definitely one of the most unique treasures of both of the Brazilian and Peruvian Rainforest. JATOBA TEA is well known to the people of the Amazon and has been used there for centuries as a staple herbal component of many of the indigenous people. It has been used extensively for hundreds of years by the lumberjacks in the Brazil forests as an energizer to help them feel strong and vigorous.  They can be seen day after day, heading off to work, carrying their "jug" of JATOBA TEA. They work hard and need lots of energy to keep going in the hot and humid climate of the rainforest.</p>

<h2>GOOD TASTING</h2>
<p>  JATOBA TEA is truly good tasting and can be used as an herbal beverage by the whole family, or it can be used at special times for special purposes as part of an overall health-supporting program.  It can be drank alone, just by adding hot water, or honey can be added if desired. Some individuals in South America believe the benefits of JATOBA TEA are enhanced when honey is added. However, it is always of value to add a little lemon juice to the tea. The acidity from the lemon juice helps to free the active alkaloid substances from the tannins so that they are much more easily absorbed into the body to provide their benefits. It is not necessary to add so much lemon that the tea becomes too tart, only a little is adequate.</p>

<h2>OTHER INDIGENOUS USES</h2>
 <p>  Besides being used for weakness, energy and stamina, JATOBA TEA has been used as a tonic for the respiratory and urinary systems by the indigenous people of the Amazon Basin for centuries. Like Pau d' Arco, Jatoboa is known for its ability to fight fungus and yeast-like candida albicans. Jatoba is also included in Life Plus <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mprost.htm">PROSTATE FORMULA</A>. This great tasting tea is packaged in 30 convenient, easy-to-use tea bags per box. Just drink it hot or cold as you would any tea.</p>

<h2>SYNERGISTIC WITH OTHER PRODUCTS</h2> 
<p>JATOBA TEA is extremely beneficial by itself or is also very useful as an addition to the diet as a synergistic beverage for those needing more energy, experiencing discomfort of the respiratory or urinary systems and in support of all weight loss programs.  It is especially synergistic when taken together with Life Plus <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mprost.htm"> PROSTATE FORMULA</A>. Also it can be a very worthwhile addition to those taking Life Plus <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mlung.htm">LUNG FORMULA</A> for its synergistic effects. Some people notice an increase in frequency of urination and include it along with <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mdiuplx.htm">DIUPLEX</A> when desired.</p>

<h2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</h2> 
<p>In addition to the bark of the Jatoba tree being used for energy and stamina, it has been used for numerous other health benefits for centuries.   Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the Amazon Rainforests. Life Plus and Life Plus Members are committed to doing everything within their power to ensure the preservation of our life-giving rainforests.</p>

<h2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>   Life Plus JATOBA TEA is a natural botanical product. It is made from the bark of the Jatoba tree known scientifically as Hymenaea courbaril. The bark is ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like Jatoba found in Life Plus JATOBA TEA and other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</p>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<h2>HOW TO USE JATOBA TEA</h2>
<p>  Steep one JATOBA TEA bag in one full cup (8 oz) of boiling water for at least five minutes.  The longer it steeps, the more nutrients the tea will contain. Add some lemonjuice to aid the bioavailability of important phytonutrients. Add honey to taste if desired. Drink as a delicious hot or iced beverage, two or more times per day or as desired for energy, to support the urinary or respiratory systems, or for its natural anti-fungal action. JATOBA TEA can be made up by the quart or half-gallon and stored in the refrigerator if desired.  The inclusion of a small amount of lemon juice is best because the natural acidity in the lemon juice helps to free the active alkaloids in the tea from the tannins contained in it. Tnis causes the alkaloids to be more easily assimilated by the body and therefore more utilized as well. Do not add more lemon juice than what is necessary as the taste can become too tart--a little is all you need.</p>
