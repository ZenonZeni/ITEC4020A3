<b>Minimal Processing Section</b> (Coordinator: Dr A S Grandison)<p>
This section investigates ways of minimising process severity while improving
or maintaining product quality.  This can be achieved by developing new
processes, or combining minimal processes.  Current research is organised into
two main themes: <p>
<p>
i	<u>Combination processes</u> including irradiation are used to provide
enhanced effects on shelf-life or microbiological safety while minimising
quality changes in the food.  Projects include the study of the effects on
lethality and survival of microorganisms in model systems and poultry meat, and
the effects of combination processing on the texture and flavour of fruit.<p>
<p>
ii	<u>Physical separation processes</u> (e.g. membranes) can be used to replace
conventional chemical or high temperature methods.  Research projects include
the utilisation of dairy fluids and the processing of legumes.<p>
<p>
<b>Food Microbial Interactions Section</b> (Coordinator: Dr J D Owens)<p>
This section is concerned with the beneficial uses of microorganisms in food
fermentations and in novel applications of microorganisms in foods.  The
section has two main interests, one dealing with the kinetics of microbial
growth and the biochemical changes in solid substrate food fermentations and
the other with the basic physiology of lactic acid bacteria, particularly in
relation to their possible use as natural preservatives in non-fermented
foods.<p>
<p>
The studies on traditional food fermentations aim to elucidate the
microbiological and biochemical changes in order to improve the traditional
technologies and develop new or modified products or processes.  Currently we
are working on tape (Indonesian, mildly alcoholic, soured and sweetened rice or
cassava), tempe (moulded soyabeans) and the applications of the tempe process
to African legumes, maize fermentation (Mexican pozol, African kenkey and
munkoyo).<p>
<p>
The work on lactic acid bacteria is investigating ways of using natural
fermentations or their products to restrict growth of pathogens and spoilage
organisms in foods.  Our studies are concentrating on ways of directing the
metabolism of lactic acid bacteria towards the production of inhibitory
metabolites and on ways of exploiting interaction between fermentation products
and normal food components in order to produce safer foods.<p>
<p>
Currently we have financial support from MAFF and NRI.  Two research students
are supported by their respective Indonesian and Mexican governments.<p>
<p>
<b>Thermal Processing Section</b> (Coordinator: Dr M J Lewis)<p>
The main thrust of this section is heat treatment and drying, the emphasis
being on safety and quality.  Heat treatment is concerned with the use of high
temperature short time processes for sterilisation, pasteurisation and cooking.
A variety of well instrumented heat exchangers are available in the Food
Studies Building: plate, tubular, scraped surface, direct systems and an
extruder.  The quality aspects studied include flavour changes - volatile
formation and losses and sensory characteristics.  Other aspects are flow
characteristics, residence time measurements, fouling behaviour, including
rapid tests for predicting fouling behaviour and on-line measurement of
fouling.  The stability of UHT concentrates and the effects of composition,
processing conditions and storage are being evaluated.  Viscous materials are
being studied on an HTST pasteuriser and emulsion stability on a scraped
surface heat exchanger.  On-line monitoring of quality aspects is also being
investigated.<p>
<p>
Studies in dehydration include mechanisms of heat and mass transfer in
convective drying and modelling for the prediction of drying time.  A spouted
bed drier for liquids is being developed and 
evaluated.  A novel toroidal bed drier is also under scrutiny and model systems
using enzymes and vitamins to quantify the severity of drying processes are
being developed.  The latter project is financially supported by the EC FLAIR
programme.<p>
<p>
<b>Modelling and Control Section</b> (Coordinator: Dr K Niranjan)<p>
As the food processing industries adopt modern technologies to meet increasing
consumer demands, there is a widely accepted need to develop mathematical
models which describe the effect of processing on food quality and safety.
These models may be incorporated into computer software and used to design new
processes which maximise safety and minimise quality loss.  Alternatively,
these models can also be used to control the operating variables of a running
process, and restrict their variation to within acceptable limits.  <p>
<p>
Unlike the chemical industries which have benefitted enormously from modelling
and computer aided design and control, these methodologies have not yet been
intensively applied to the food industries.  The Modelling and Control Section
of this research group is actively involved in developing computer models for
(i) thermal processes (in-container as well as continuous aseptic) (ii)
freezing and (iii) drying/dehydration, using fundamental principles of momentum
heat and mass trasnfer.  The research group has access to the University's main
frame computer system, SUN workstation, as well as users of several advanced
simulation software, for example ANSY(TM) and SPEED-UP(TM) (in collaboration with
the Biotechnology Research Group).
