<H3>Marijuana smoking associated with kidney damage</H3>
<BR>
The authors, Lambrecht et al, in Nephron, 70:494496, 1995, report on a 29-year-old
man admitted to the hospital with severe pain in his back. He had smoked
marijuana for 10 years, and just prior to admission had smoked several marijuana
cigarettes and consumed several bottles of beer. No other psychotropic drugs
were used. An area of damage in the right kidney resulting from a block
in the major branch of the right kidney artery was detected. Toxicology
screening on the urine revealed cannabinoids. All other causes of acute
kidney infarction were excluded. The world's literature on cannabis effects
on the kidney was reviewed by the authors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>This report is the first one showing clotting off of
an artery to the kidney resulting from acute marijuana smoking. The cardiovascular
effects of marijuana are well-known and include dilation of peripheral blood
vessels resulting in blood pressure changes and reflex, speeding up of the
heart rate. If the heart rate is inadequate, there may be drops in blood
flow to organs such as the kidney with resulting thrombosis of small arteries.
Marijuana is known to be associated with myocardial infarction and stroke
(Zachariah SB, Stroke 22:406-409, 1991; Charles et al. Clinical Toxicology
14:433-438, 1979). It is also possible that the marijuana damaged the blood
vessels directly, as has been suggested for other drugs of abuse, such as
amphetamines (Baden et al. New England Journal of Medicine, 284:111-113,
1971). It is clear from this case report, however, that a previously healthy
male with acute ingestion of marijuana can clog the blood vessels of a major
organ.
<H3>British study illuminates negative aspects of regular marijuana use</H3>
A self-reporting study of the behavior of marijuana users attending a community
drug and alcohol climic was reported on by McBride in Drug and Alcohol Dependence
39:29-32, 1995. One hundred consecutive users were interviewed. All were
Caucasian and 85% were male. The mean age was 28 and their cannabis use
had been ongoing for approximately 12.5 years. No one in the sample was
employed. All were receiving state benefits. Eighty percent smoked tobacco
cigarettes as well. The author found that the average consumption of cannabis
in the week preceding the interview was 10.5 grams with 60% of interviewees
smoking daily. The average cannabis cigarette comprised 3 cigarette papers,
the tobacco from three-quarters of a king-sized cigarette, and 0.35 grams
of cannabis resin. Only 26% of the sample smoked tobacco in the absence
of cannabis. Only 5% of the population took cannabis by oral ingestion.
The amount of money spent on the cannabis averaged &#163;35.00 or approximately
$50.00 per week at current exchange rates. The author concluded that the
high doses of cannabis used, the frequency of use, and the expenditure on
the drug relative to income raised questions about the assumed benign effects
of cannabis among those attending such clinics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>Heavy use of cannabis was documented in patients attending
drug and alcohol clinics for which cannabis was not the primary reason for
referral to the clinic. Amphetamines, alcohol, opioids, and benzodiazepines
comprised 94% of the cases referred. This data shows the frequency of cannabis
use in combination with tobacco. This makes it very difficult to interpret
self-reporting data about the health effects of tobacco alone. It is clear
that drug-seeking behavior, even in patients undergoing treatment for drug
and alcohol abuse, is not completely gone since other drugs are being used
at the same time. Perhaps the difficulty in obtaining a higher level of
treatment success relates to this fact. It is also startling to note the
amount of money being spent on cannabis by a population supported by the
government and in whom tremendous healthcare resources are being expended.
<H3>Marijuana cigarette triggers severe hyperthermia</H3>
The symptoms of heatstroke include a body temper-ature of 104&#176; F or
greater, and delirium, coma, or seizures. Many drugs and chemicals have
been associated with heatstroke, including amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, and
PCP. Walter and associates, in Clinical Toxicology, 34:217-221, report a
case of life-threatening hyperthermia associated with the use of marijuana
alone. A 24 year-old man with a history of smoking one marijuana cigarette
twice a month for many years left his office immediately after smoking one
marijuana cigarette. He was acclimatized to the environment but had been
jogging for only one week. The temperature was 84&#176; F with a low relative
humidity. He had no preexisting medical conditions. After jogging for 15
minutes, he became acutely ill and collapsed. Paramedics were called who
noted a hot, red, dry skin and an agitated combative condition. They took
him to an emergency department where his rectal temperature was recorded
at 107&#176; F. He required aggressive cooling and a tracheal tube for assisted
breathing. It took him 16 hours to return to his usual mental state. All
tests were negative except for urine and blood toxicology screens, which
showed cannabinoids. No other drugs associated with hyperthermia were detected.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>This case report fits with animal studies and some human
data showing that marijuana interferes with normal temperature control.
In animal studies, marijuana has been shown to produce a condition known
as poikilothermia, which is a loss of the ability to regulate temperature
control. Marijuana is known to increase heat production in humans (Hanna
et al. Aviation Space Environmental Medicine, 47:634-639, 1976, Rosenberg
et al. Cntical Care Medicine, 14:964-969, 1986). Thus, people who smoke
marijuana in environments of high temperature and exert themselves are excessively
predisposed to hyperthermia, which can be lifethreatening. The smoker feels
less hot than they really are because of constriction of skin blood vessels
and diminished sweating. The impaired ability to feel overheated produces
a greater chance of developing heatstroke.
<H3>THC causes abnormalities in immune molecules</H3>
Zhu and colleagues continue a series of investigations into the mechanism
of the immunological effects of the active ingredient in marijuana smoke,
tetrahydrocannabinol (The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,
274:10011007, 1995). These authors had previously reported that interleukin
2, a potent substance released by activated immune cells (which are necessary
for a proper immune response) is suppressed by ingredients in marijuana
smoke. The current studies use a line of cloned natural killer cells of
the immune system which are mixed with varying concentrations of THC. These
cells were blocked in their ability to display this important molecule.
The authors suggest that this effect may account in part, at least, for
the THC suppression of the immune response.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>Further studies by the active immunology group of Klein,
et al, at the University of South Florida, has further explained the way
in which the active ingredient of marijuana can suppress the immune response.
Somewhat surprisingly, the liberation of an important molecule by lymphocytes
was not reduced, but instead, the place where it attaches on activated cells
was suppressed. The result of this abnormality is that a cloned cell line
of natural killer cells could not function in their ability to attack invading
foreign molecules. Although these results are done in a test tube, it is
frightening to think what the implications of this work is for patients
already immunosuppressed by the viral disease, AIDS, where part of the viral
infection is impairment of the immune system. Smoking marijuana in this
setting would further depress the body's ability to fight those invading
organisms which, ultimately, are the cause the death of most AIDS patients.
<H3>Rectal THC effective as an appetite stimulant</H3>
One potential use of delta-9 THC (dronabinol) is as an appetite stimulant
in patients with cancer or AIDS. Mattes et al., Pharmacologic Pharmacology
Biochemistry, and Behavior, 49:187-195, 1994, reviewed the subject of cannabinoids
and appetite stimulation. They noted that most but not all prior studies
showed marijuana to have some appetite stimulating property. In this study
eleven subjects, all of whom were casual marijuana cigarette users, were
observed. The authors compared oral THC with administration by a rectal
suppository. Mean daily food intake was significantly increased when the
patient was routinely using the rectal suppository, but this did not occur
with either an oral capsule or dissolving an oral dose under the tongue.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>This study confirms the efficacy of rectal suppositories
in appetite stimulation. The drug absorption from the rectal suppository
was adequate to accomplish the therapeutic goal compared to oral or inhalation
routes. There was no correlation between drug efficacy and the age, gender,
the dnug &quot;high,&quot; or plasma drug levels. This study further supports
the possibility of developing a rectal suppository form of delta-9 THC for
use in appetite stimulation in chronically ill patients. <BR>
