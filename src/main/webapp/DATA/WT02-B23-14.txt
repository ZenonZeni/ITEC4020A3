Comdedy?</I></H2>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_JOKE -->
<LI>i love ellen's show
<LI>Janeane Garofalo is the best commedian today. She's fresh, original, and totally honest. She ROCKS!!
<LI>I think ELLEN ROCKS..so what she is a lesbo,,,do you ask your friends what type of underware you are waring?...thats how personal this is...LET her BE.damn it..she is human...and the best CLEAN comic around.besides R0sie*
<LI>My favorite show is The Drew Carey Show.
<LI>I can't believe you didn't list All in the Family as a possibility for best sitcom.  Hell, it could also be listed for best drama, or for that matter, best T.V. show of all time.  Not only was it a pioneer for sitcoms by including many serious issues, and dealing with them dramatically, but it also commented on the state of who we were.
<LI>Ellen is excELLENent! 
<LI>Adam Sandler is great too!
<LI>Rosie O'Donnel is a very good uplifting show with good clean fun to up lift anyones life. Shes brought to day time something that was really needed. My hat off to her she's great!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Chris Elliott, Conan O'brien, Brian Reagan, SCTV, David Letterman, Janeane Garofalo, Hogan's Heroes, Red Dwarf, Howard Stern, Match Game 73-78, Jim Carrey, Drew Carrey, Munsters, Carry On movies, Beavis and Butthead, Mike Myers, Louis C.K., Monty Python, Beverly Hillbillies, ALL RULE!!!  Ellen and Smelly James SUCK!!!
<LI>Talk Soup is not quite a talk show, but it is reaaaallllly funny (to me) Jon (the host) ROCKS!
<LI>The funniest joke of all.....My salary!  I am an elementary teacher in Texas!
<LI>Left Out:Damon Wayans, Chris Rock, Mr.Bean and probably some others. The State must return to television and so must The Kids in the Hall (or at least another movie).
<LI>D. L. Hughly is a beast and he should do another standup.
<LI>George Carlin is the best Stand up comedian ever but Eddie Murphy is up there with him! 
<LI>Jonathan Winters is the master of them all.  Robin Williams blatantly ripped him off.  If you want to know who the greatest improvisational comedian of the all is, go get yourself some Jonathan Winters CDs or tapes.
<LI>ROWAN ATKINSON  is by Far the most talented Comedian Of all Time!  American humor stinks! let's face it, the only good TV shows in the USA are MST3K and The Simpsons.
<LI>WE LOVE MAD TV!!!! (ALSO, WE LOVE ROSIE O"DONNEL, oh, Orlando Jones on Mad TV is funny!)
<LI>Ellen is my favorite sitcom right now!!!
<LI>Favorite Comedian: Ellen DeGeneres; Favorite sitcom: Ellen!
<LI>JIM DAVID is one of the funniest unknowns working around the country. White TRash rules!
<LI>Gerry Swallow - best live stand-up; Pat Bullard - funniest current talk show host; Jon Stewart - funniest ex-talk show host.
<LI>The Daily Show is the funniest show I've seen in a very long time.
<LI>My absolute favorite sitcom is ofcourse "Ellen".  I love it!
<LI>Mystery Science Theater 3000
<LI>Elaine Boosler, Jeff Dunnum, 3rd Rock From the Sun
<LI>I love The Drew Carey Show and Mad About You
<LI>"Ellen" is usually pretty funny; I think Ellen DeGeneris is the Lucy of the '90's
<LI>Gerry Swallow, tonight show comedian, very funny guy, why not listed?
<LI>Gilda Radner in early Saturday Night Live was one of the best!!!
<LI>my favorite joke kind of thing was the telephone call to god one by Ellen DeGeneres
<LI>Howie Mandell is hysterical - I love him!
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnel show
<LI>I' m funny put me on your list!
<LI>Funniest male comic is Dane Cook, funniest female is Denise Burns.  Newsradio and Drew Carey are funniest sitcoms - and Dr. Katz is the funniest show on TV.  You didn't have a place for funniest female actress but it is Kathy Griffin on "Suddenly Susan" and this survey is very male dominated.
<LI>The greatest actor of all time is Kevin Kline because he started in Theatre before movies, so he knew how to affect the audiance. I think the same goes with sitcoms and stand up comedians, comedians are better when they start from scratch. The best show in the world is Saturday Night Live. All the shows not just one generation! Most of the Amazing comedians came from that show. Ex: Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, Dan Akroyd, David Spade, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, and many others
who hosted and were a part of the SNL family.  I also think the British are very very very funny! If anyone would like to talk movies, acting or comedy write me at amccurdy@comland.com -Amy 
<LI>I dont have a joke in particular to tell, but my favorie types are the ones where something is left out, and figuring out the missing part is what makes it funny
<LI>ELLEN show should be on
<LI>Laurel and Hardy: the funniest of them all. Married..with Children: at its best, a viciously hilairious satire of American life.
<LI>MST3k! where is it?
<LI>ELLEN DEGENERES WHAT MORE CAN I SAY
<LI>fave sitcom -- Ellen
<LI>ADAM SANDLER
<LI>What did Jesus say to the abo's whilst hanging on the cross A. Dont do anything till I get back
<LI>I love Ellen's jokes!
<LI>Chris Rock!!!
<LI>I love Tom Rhodes and Jon Stewart.  Both of them are extremely talented and very yummy.  =)
<LI>Bewitched!!!!!
<LI>I like Night Stand. Monty Python was great. Original SNL, too.
<LI>Cybil and Mariann are tops.
<LI>Fav. situation comedy is "Ellen".
<LI>On the flip side,australia we have the comedy company and Fast forward.  I think both would do well in the U.S..
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is the funniest comedian and her show Ellen is the best show on television and it is better than all those listed.
<LI>ANTHONY CLARK is the GREATEST!!  Watch BOSTON COMMON!!
<LI>Martin!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Rosie O'donnell is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Hey, you left out The Rosie O'Donnell show for best talk show!
<LI>Jay Leno's delivery is the best (and it's within 30 minutes or it's free)
<LI>Best TV Sitcom = ELLEN!!!!!!
<LI>the entire Wayans family is hilarious.You need to upgrade your list of sitcoms.
<LI>You REALLY REALLY need to add Adam Sandler to the list.
<LI>I think Marsha Warfield (Roz on Night Court) should be added to the list of female comedians.
<LI>Denis Leary is really my favorite male comedian--you should put him on the list.  
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnel Show
<LI>Favourite comediens? Brian Regan and Suzanne Westenhoffer...the RULE
<LI>Why didn't you list "Ellen" same school as DVD
<LI>Mr. Bean rocks!
<LI>I think that Saturday Night Live, MAD TV, Royal Canadian Air Farce, are the best sketch comedy programs.  Rosie O'Donnel is the best talk show host and Cheri Oteri and Nicole Sullivan are the best sketch comedy actress'
<LI>When that guy, you know who I'm talking about, did something funny to that other guy
<LI>They were not funny! ha ha ha ha ha 
<LI>Absolutely Fabulous (British)
<LI>Ellen is the best show
<LI>Carol Burnett show is one of my favorites! Oh yeah, Rosie O'Donnells talk show is the best!
<LI>I like it when women whip out their boobs.  Its funny.
<LI>I'm British, so my favourite stand-up is a guy called Eddie Izzard, and my favourite sitcoms are "Blackadder", "Red Dwarf" and "The New Statesman", as well as "Frasier".
<LI>Danny Kaye, Jack Benny, Bob Hope, George Burns, Lucille Ball are the GREATEST comedians of the 20th century!!!
<LI>Rosie O'Donnel's talk show is about the best I've seen-daytime wise, that is.
<LI>Mike Moore and his show "T.V. Nation" is extremely funny. Good satire, my favorite.
<LI>I think Joesph Donato is a riot. Why has he not gotten a show? I don't know. Anyway Joseph is cutting edge, Dice style with Cosby class. Oh I have his real email address. it is( jdcomedian@earthlink.net ) I got it from somone home page, and he reply's.  Joseph keep up the good work buddy. Gee I went a bit long on this comment. oh well  Joseph Donato if you see this  do another show in Boston, Thanks: Craig L
<LI>Favorite comedian LUCILLE BALL
<LI>theres this chap and he chaps at this door and this chap answers the door and the chap who chapped at the door says," is yer granny in?" and the chap who answeed the chap at the door says, " no she's et arbroth" and th chap who chapped at the door says, "oh its all right tell her i'l come in and wait until she's finished" also, whats the commonest thing for someone in aberdeen to say after answering the door? - come away in, yel huv hud yer tea? 
<LI>Jason Alexander as George on Seinfeld is just about the most polished performance possible, totally excellent!
<LI>How did the Newfie break his leg raking leaves?  HE FELL OUT OF THE TREE.
<LI>Mad about you for sitcom
<LI>Ellen Degeneres is the best!
<LI>R.I.P. Bakersfield PD. So funny I laughed all the way through the adverts. Maybe it will follow in the footsteps of Police Squad and have three successful movies made out of it. British and Irish comedians are generally better than American (but then, I s
<LI>early Roseanne episodes were brillant - has since lost the plot however.
<LI>Drew Carey RULES!
<LI>BILL COSBY IN HIS EARLY 60S COMEDY ALBUMS WAS THE FUNNIEST 'STAND UP' I EVER HEARD.  MASH WAS THE BEST TOTAL SHOW, BUT SEINFELD IS THE FUNNIEST.
<LI>I think Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest and most talented comedians out there, even though some people may get easily offended by his jokes.  He doesn't mean any harm, but it's not exactly something I would go around repeating (ex: Raw).  I also think the TV show Friends is hilarious!
<LI>THE BEST MALE COMEDIAN IS MARTIN LAWRENCE ALL THE WAY.PUT HIM ON THTE LIST!
<LI>Three's Company is the best show of ALL TIME.
<LI>I think that you missed one of the most talented comedians I have seen - Rowan Atkinson is funny beyond belief because he possesses the ability to make some one laugh without saying a thing. He is probably best known for his Blackadder performance and his Mr Bean performance.  Very underated and very funny.  Also I feel that the Late Bill Hicks was hilarious as is Eddie Izzard.
<LI>Firesign Theatre, John Cleese (in anything), Gilda Radner, Comic Relief (the entire production, as well as the MC's--Crystal, Goldberg, and Williams), early sketches by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, CLASSIC improv by Nichols and May AND by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. movie parodies by Carol Burnett's ensemble.  
<LI>Drew Carey is by far THE funniest show on TV today.
<LI>Comedian: Louie Anderson very funny. 
<LI>Howard Stern
<LI>3rd rock 3rd rock 3rd rock!! Need I say more?
<LI>Ellen is the best sit-com on tv...
<LI>Drew Carrey <-- Funny.  Adam Sandler <-- Not.  Fran Drescher <-- Funny.  Ellen the Degenerate <-- not.  Denis Leary <-- funny and insightful.  Sam Kinnison <-- funny and irreverent and dead.  Howard Stern <-- funny and innovative.  Rosie O'D <-- talk show is good.  Spalding Gray <-- Could and Should have Talk Show.  Garrison K. <-- Funny, but an acquired taste.  Tom and Ray <-- Damn funny (and about cars!).  Robin Williams <-- has been.  Steve Martin <-- now more of a straight man.  Lily Thomlin <-- Pi
neer.  Jay Ward Cartoons <-- Brilliant.  Little Rascals <-- Still funny 70 years later.  "Who's on First?" <-- Greatest Routine ever written.
<LI>Janeane Garofalo rules as female comedian!
<LI>I don't remember his last name but the guy whose Eddie on that new show Malcolm and Eddie. His stand up is hilarious. Also Bill Bellamy (you survey seems to omit a lot of the young black comics :( )  Margret Chong is also very funny.
<LI>One of my favorite comediennes is Kathy Buckley(I believe this is how she spells her name)
<LI>There really was no way to choose on many of the first questions. My all-time favorite show has to be Mystery Science Theater 3000. It employs a writing staff that keeps the laughs coming and I love to "rank" on bad movies <G>.
<LI>Your choices suck. You Americans don't know what comedy is.
<LI>Sam Kinison was the ultimate king of standup comedy, and nobody will ever come close to emmulating his persona
<LI>Miss Kitty was walking down Dodge's street by the livery stable, saw a light thru a wall crack and looked in.  Chester had a shovel of warm horse manure held by his crotch with his pants down.  He was excited.  Miss Kitty steped it, raised her dress and said "Chester, why don't you just put it in here?"  He replyed "THE WHOLE SHOVELFULL MISS KITTY?"     
<LI>Denis Leary is the ultimate comedian.  No one is more honest in such a hysterical way.  He's is a great actor as well!!  
<LI>check your spelling; it IS important sometimes ... Pryor ... O'Donnell, others
<LI>Adam Sandler is a great, funny actor and should be included!!
<LI>Rosie O'Donnell has the best talk show on t.v.
<LI>Danny Kaye is still the master; I defy any modern male comics to perform at his level!
<LI>Ellen as favorite sit-com
<LI>I LOVE ROSIE! 
<LI>favorite comedy show - Ellen
<LI>Bob Hope.  Comedy does not have to be filthy to be funny.
<LI>Third Rock from the Sun is the Best!
<LI>Three's Company is THE BEST!
<LI>Leslie Nielson is one of the best!  And Jay Leno get s high marks for fresh humor that spoofs the current sad situation in the U.S.
<LI>Hey..you left out America's foremost comedic bard..Howard Stern
<LI>Drew Carey show is the funniest on TV today
<LI>OUR LOCAL PBS GETS BRITISH COMEDIES.  HILARIOUS!  ONLY COMEDY THAT MAKES ME LAUGH OUT LOUD WHEN I'M BY MYSELF.
<LI>ELLEN should be listed in the sitcom list it's the best.I look forward to it every week!
<LI>ELLEN should be listed in the sitcom list it's the best. Il
<LI>The all-time funniest show ever on TV is "The Honeymooners", by a factor of about a thousand. Of the shows currently on the air, none of them really break me up because they're written by morons for morons; however "The Nanny" occasionally blunders into something slightly amusing by accident.
<LI>I think Ed Wynn was one of the all-time great comedians, but I enjoyed even more the dramatic work he did.  I think two of his finest performances were in "Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl" and Rod Serling's masterpiece "Requiem for a Heavyweight." I hope you agree.
<LI>The best sitcom was "Three's Company" hands down!
<LI>Where are Gallager, Adam Sandler, and Carrot Top?? Just wondering!! =P
<LI>Are You Being Served?, next to Monty Python's Flying Circus, is the best British comedy ever
<LI>I enjoy Jerry Seinfeld in the sit-com much more than his stand-up routine.
<LI>George Carlin may be my favorite stand-up comedian, but he can't act worth beans and I'm glad he doesn't have his own show anymore.
<LI>What's little yellow and you can jump on it?   A baby duck!!!!
<LI>Abott & Costello will live on forever.  But they need some TV time to get remembered.
<LI>Two priests walk into a bar.... With all of the times this joke has been told, by this time you would have thought that they would have seen it.
<LI>Rosie O'Donel is my favorite TV Talk Show
<LI>BENNY HILL!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Put Adam Sandler in your list of comedians because he rules
<LI>Jim Carrey is a one trick pony, and i've seen the trick.  He can now go to France and be hailed as the second coming of Jerry Lewis.
<LI>KINISON LIVES!!!!
<LI>Married with Children, Wings
<LI>The Election
<LI>Jerry Seinfeld is the funniest comedian since Steve Martin in the early eighties.
<LI>I know what you're thinking, Steve when do you find time to juggle?
<LI>If you do not agree that Monty Python kicks ass, I shall say "Ni!" to you until you bring me a shrubbery and cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with this herring!!!
<LI>simpsons is the best. rowan atkinson.
<LI>3rd Rock from the Sun, Cybil
<LI>The Firesign Theatre is the best of all.  Too bad they don't get enough exposure!
<LI>Ellen Degeneres  ABC's Ellen the show
<LI> you should add ellen to the list of sitcoms genius
<LI>Brett Butler is pretty funny.  Kinda raunchy, but, then again, so am I.
<LI>Red Skelton is the greatest comedian of all time!!
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is THE BEST!! She should be on all the categories. Go Ellen, go!
<LI>I just love Ellen and Rosie o'donnell, they are the best women comedians around, would like to see more of them!!
<LI>I just love Ellen and Rosie o'donnell, they are the best women comedians around, would like to see more of them!!
<LI>Computer geek jokes
<LI>You must include Rosie O'Donnell's show in talk show category....she is by far THE best!!!!
<LI>just dont forget John Candy!!! (especially in Planes Tranes and Automobiles with Steve MArtin)
<LI>OH MY GOODNESS!  Why don't you NOT have Ellen on the list for favorite Shows.  She SO, so so so so so so so funny.  She was also really funny in Mr. Wrong.  Ellen Degeneres is the supreme ruler of comedy, no else even compares.  Thanks, Loree
<LI>#5.  Why are there only male comedians listed??  #4. Rosie O'Donell Show
<LI>Bob Newhart and Stan Frieberg should get a mention here somewhere!  -- Joke: How many Right Wing Fundamentalists does it take to change a lightbulb?   Give-up?   Answer:  ???!!!!???Change???!!!???
<LI>sinbad is the funnest comedian I've ever seen. what do winnie the pooh and john the bapist have in common? they have the same middle name! middle name being "the"
<LI>Adam Sandler ROCKS so stop looking at me swan!!!
<LI>Denis Leary--He tells it like it is and the way things SHOULD be.
<LI>Ellen Degeneres is the funniest comedian to ever walk the face of the earth!!!!!!  Her show is awesome and her book rocks the house!!!!!!

<LI>My favorite comedy is british comedy. American comedy is a pale imitation
<LI>Drew Carey and his show. Cohost MIMI
<LI>you're listings are skimpy
<LI>Canadian Air Farce is my favourite comedy show on TV. But maybe it hasnt made it to the US yet.
<LI>I loved the "original" Bob Newhart Show
<LI>You forgot Drew Carey!
<LI>I know some people write in suggesting comedians such as Adam Sandler,etc.  But really...how could you leave out Gary Shandling.  He is an experienced, well-known comedian, who's show 'It's Gary Shandling's Show' was surprisingly like the later created Seinfeld (some coincidence huh?).  He's done award shows and stand-up, and is up there with Richard Pryor.  U even included Larry Sanders Show, but not Gary?
<LI>The Simpsons!
<LI>The Simpsons should be included; it is the best comedy series EVER.  Jake Johannsen should be on the list of male standups.
<LI>Rosie O'Donnell Show
<LI>Please add the Rosie O'Donnell show to the comedy talk show list.
<LI>There are alot of funny comedians out there, it is hard to choose a favorite. But I enjoy Rosie o'Donnel, Ellen D. Meg Ryan,John Candy,( sad that he is gone) Tim Allen, I perferr comedy over anything else.
<LI>Ellen is the best show ever!!!
<LI>Where's Rosie O'Donnell for talk show?
<LI>none
<LI>MARGARET CHO IS THE BEST FEMALE COMEDIAN
<LI>Let me say that it is unbelievable that Howard Stern has been left off the list.  Many don't like him but many of those same people have not heard him.  If you are truly a comedy fan then give Howard Stern a chance.  Listen close for one week and then tell me if he is not the funniest man in the world.  Do it.  I challenge you.
<LI>Ellen rules!!!
<LI>Wildly stupid survey - there's no women listed for favorite comedy actor today.  Why no women's talk-shows?  What's the use eh?
<LI>I want to vote the Rosie O'Donnell show for best talk show.
<LI>Ellen is the best show on the face of the earth
<LI>  "Soap"   should have been on the list!
<LI>#6 - Home Improvement and Ellen
<LI>Also really like Brett Butler!
<LI>Jackie Gleason & Red Skelton

<LI>Brian Regan is the besT!
<LI>You forgot Tom Rhodes man, just thought you might want to since he's got his own show and is like cool to the nth power.
<LI>I didn't see Gallagher's name!!
<LI> If a Santa Claus, a smart blond and a dumb blond jumped off a cliff which one do you think would land first? The dumb blond because neither of the other exist.
<LI>There wasa female standup comedian (I couldn't remember her name or  I'd have voted for her), who came up with the following> I had a friend once who was in labor for 36 hours. I don't  even want to do anything I like for 36 hours.
<LI>Ellen as favorite show
<LI>Rosie O'Donnell is the best talk show, and Ellen is the best sitcom--best things to ever happen to american pop culture
<LI>I've followed Drew Carey and Louie Anderson for years and I think they're AMAZING!!!!!

<LI>CAROL BURNETTE 
<LI>The young ones rule they are  soooo funny ha ha
<LI>Jim Carrey/Elaine Boosler/Friends
<LI>Rosie has the best talk show!!!
<LI>Newsradio! This Hour Has 22 Minutes! Codco! Drew Carey! Naked Truth!
<LI>I think that THE SIMPSON`S is the most laugh packed 1/2 hour in TV history. I know its a cartoon, but they cover everything. I love it.
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres deserves her own channel
<LI>Gallagher for male, Carol Burnett for female
<LI>Aaaggghh.  I can't remember the guys name that is sooo funny.  Short, chubby, older guy, ... Billy Holly or something.

<LI>"Ellen" is my favorite show.  I hope she comes out this season.
<LI>i have no idea how you could by-pass the the most entertaining comic in the buissness however he is quite vulgar but thats the funny part dennis leary, also adam sandlerand andrew dice clay this is only my opinion but i know for a fact that millions of ot

<LI>The ?comedians? of today think the F word is a MUST in telling jokes - GET A BRAIN !
<LI>David Spade is awesome
<LI>Go Girl - Go Ellen - the best.....!!!!!
<LI>reagon(the comedian) is quote funny
<LI>Bakersfield PD was possibly THE funniest show to come out of the US in years! And it was cancelled after just one series I believe... there is no justice.
<LI>Sorry you omitted Don Rickles - He's the best!
<LI>You left out Howard Stern and his E! show on the list...
<LI>Ellen Degener
<LI>Watch Drew Carey (for Mimi) and Ellen every week without fail.  Both shows are entertaining, funny, and can be very real life!  Let's make sure we keep them on the air for a while.
<LI>Why is Clinton in the White House?...We're all still stoned!!
<LI>Jim Carrey RULES, he is like a god...
<LI>Steven Pearl
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is THE funniest comedian in the world and always will be! Anyone who thinks differently is a drinker.  :)
<LI>Absolutely Fabulous on BBC/Comedy Central is very funny and makes a great drinking game: Drink whenever someone says "sweetie" or "darling". Finish your drink if anyone says "fabulous".
<LI>You have to put Jim Carrey into the comedy movie actor section.
<LI>Mark Lowry
<LI>Ellen Degeneres is a breath of fresh air.  She makes Wednesday nights something to look forward to on her show Ellen.  Thanks!
<LI>I think you need to add ELLEN to the list of best comedy sit-coms.
<LI>Mr. Bean gets NO respect.
<LI>Male - Larry Miller; Show - Mad about You
<LI>Curly Howard and the other Stooges are by far the funniest ever!!!!
<LI>i love drew carey, third rock.
<LI>Ellen Rules
<LI>I know they aren't as popular now, but musical comedy is great also (Tom Lerher)
<LI>You're missing all my favorite sitcoms!  How about the Burns and Allen Show?  A classic!  Or what about the Odd Couple?  STILL cracks me up after zillions of viewings! Others worthy of mention:  Car 54, The Honeymooners, The Jack Benny Program-- oh! What about Taxi!  Simply masterful!
<LI>Sinbad - GREAT!  Needs help on his acting, but has potential.
<LI>My favorite show/sitcom is Barney Miller
<LI>Fraiser- I love that show!  David Hyde Pierce is the best!
<LI>Rosie O'Donell has the funniest and best talk show on television today.
<LI>Is Seinfeild really funny? I don't think so.
<LI>You overlooked Brett Butler... her stand-up is incredible!!! :)
<LI>Ellen is not on your list for show/sitcom. I also think you should include the dana carvey show. it rocked!
<LI>id vote for robin williams for best male commedian if you had that option.
<LI>GERRY SWALLOW ROCKS!
<LI>You guys ought to add Bobby Collins and Larry Reeb to your favorite comics list.  Those two guys are hysterical!
<LI>drew carey show and tgif
<LI>The Louie Anderson Show was super..too bad it was cancelled.
<LI>The Simpsons, HOW could you forget THE SIMPSONS!! Cartoons should never be neglected as a form of comedic entertainment for young and old veiwers alike!!! Animaniacs! Looney Toons! But definetely NOT Disney.
<LI>Favorite sitcom - Ellen....favorite comedian - Ellen......Go Ellen, go ellen, go ellen........
<LI>For Stand -up you forgot Gallagher & Howie Mandell. As for shows  You need to have Drew Carrey. A joke huh?  What is the difference between a good year and a great year?     One is a tire the other is 365 condoms!
<LI>As far as stand-up goes, the KING is Steve Martin.  Insightful, silly, witty and at times, just plain stupid.  He had it all.
<LI>Third Rock From the Sun;  Riddle "What was the movie on TWA flight 800?"  Answer:  "Forget Paris"
<LI>Larry Miller is the funniest.. His first time skiing story was incredible 1 hour special oon hbo, as well as his stages of drinking..
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres Show should be on the list!
<LI>I think Adam Sandler is the all time funniest and should be put on this list! Thanks!!
<LI>I believe Taxi to be one of the greatest comedy shows ever and Christopher lloyd as Jim is an absolute marvel
<LI>Sinbad? No way what a loser. Sam Kinneson, by far is the best. I'm sick of all the complaining twits about vulagr humor, grow up poopie heads
<LI>Bill Irwin great physical clowning
<LI>Fresh Prince of Bel Air. He is the best and Will Smith is realy funny. But he can't dance.
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres. I think she is the most funniest woman in on TV and she is the funniest women I ever seen. She is so cool. I want to be just like her.
<LI>sitcom "Ellen"
<LI>One of my favorite shows is Dennis Miller on HBO.  The only problem I have with the show is his gratuitous use of foul language.  He was so funny on Saturday Night Live and does not need four letter words to be funny.  007
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres by a country mile.  The best comedian and the best sitcom.  Go win the Emmy Ellen!
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is the most masterful comedianne in the industry because she gets the audience to visualize and feel what she's talking about and then the audience in turn finds it hilarious.  Did that just make any sense?
<LI>Stand up male: RICHARD PRYOR;  THE best ever!!!
<LI>Ellen is the best sitcom on TV.
<LI>Woody Harrelson should be in the male actors list.
<LI>Alexi Sayle (of "Stuff") is far funnier than most of the American sitcoms.
<LI>Howard Stern is the KING OF ALL MEDIA!!!!!
<LI>Janeane Garafolo
<LI>William Shakespear, "I just peed my pants and there is nothing anyone can do about it"
<LI>Fav comedian is Gallagher, only the first half of the MASH episodes were funny, it got too political and silly around just before RADAR left.  The movie was good.
<LI>Best comedy team is Robin Williams and Jonathan Winters. Saw then together on a late night talk show and never PIMP so much in my life!
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnall show is the best show on TV (besides Party of Five)
<LI>What about Adam Sandler
<LI>Adam Ferarra is a very funny new comedian. Also there is a woman who is hilarious that uses "subliminal" messages in her act... Who is she?
<LI>I think TAXI was one of the best comedy shows
<LI>best female/male sidekick
<LI>Paula Poundstone; Rita Rudner; Judy Tenuta and Roseanne are all gr8 too!  I also think Julie Kavner is sheer genius.
<LI>Hey!  Where are The Simpsons???  They're comedy too!!!
<LI>Fawlty Towers and Absolutely Fabulous are great BBC Comedies.
<LI>Ni!  (Eckee, eckee, eckee, ptang! Voom, Boing!!!)
<LI>favourite sit-com: Married with Children
<LI>There was an engineer and a computer programmer on an airplane. The computer programmer wanted to play a game. "Tell you what," he said to the engineer, "If you can come up with a riddle I can't answer, I'll pay you $50. If you can come up with a riddle I
<LI>Australian comedy called "Fast Forward"
<LI>Red Skelton - 40's & 50's
<LI>Three's Company is defenitely one of my favorite comedy shows.
<LI>Brett Butler - Grace Under Fire - the absolute best - her sarcastic wit and ribald humor make the show, and her stand up comedy routines, fantastic
<LI>shevonne durkin is just starting out as a stand-up.  Keep your eyes open for her.
<LI>I was having a bad day so I went to a bar and asked for a double and the guy went in the back and brought out someone who looked just like me
<LI>i really liked roseann untill saw her outside of her show interviews ect.
<LI>Please include TAXI on the sit com list!
<LI>I'm a die-hard George Carlin fan - but I like all comedy.  Laughter is medicine for the soul.  I think you missed one person who at least deserves recognition for his talents, which includes comedy - Tom Hanks.  Used to love Roseanne until she got too cocky; she's not even funny anymore.  I love John Goodman.  You missed him, too.  Let's give credit to the old Saturday Night Live people especially Gilda Radner (Roseanne-Roseanna-Danna).  What a legend.  Brett Butler is definitely funnier than Roseanne.
 And Jeff Foxworthy - the great, but I AM a redneck!  How come us "rednecks" don't consider his jokes prejudice as some minorities.  Arsenio, you're gone - you got Racist on us.  Sinbad...keep up the great job.
<LI>My favorite joke:  Ok.  Arnold Shwaraneggar has a big one, George Bush has a small one, Madonna doesn't have one, and the Pope has one, but can't use it.  What is it?????  A LAST NAME!!!!!
<LI>Danny Kaye ROCKS!  
<LI>Another great comedian would be Denis Leary!
<LI>Coach!  Great show and of course there is always MArried with Children
<LI>WKRP
<LI>Actually, just a general comment... it is getting kind of disturbing how many comedians are being used as vehicles for talk show and/or sitcoms (and vice versa).  Especially when the name of the show is the name of the performer....
<LI>My favorite comedian is David Spade. My favorite movies are Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, and The Coneheads.
<LI>cosby show, Bill Cosby when he told theo about how hard it is to live on your on
<LI>Thanks... Rosie is AWESOME in her new show!

<LI>Put UK comedian Alexei Sayle on US television!
<LI>what happened to the Monty Python crew, they are some the best comediens in the world
<LI>Mort Sahl for standup;  Ernie Kovacks for all-round comic talent
<LI>I think the funniest situation comedy show of all time was All in the Family and the funniest comedy show still running is Benny Hill 
<LI>Full Frontal Comedy on HBO is a great show!!
<LI>I love the Chris Farley/David Spade duo
<LI>We love Ellen Degeneres and her show Ellen.  Can't believe you left her show out of your survey!!!!!!!!!!!!

<LI>It was a sad, sad day when Bill Hicks passed away.  One less prat to worry about (so he would say).
<LI>I think each generation has it's share of "great" comedians. 
<LI>ADAM SANDLER, CHRIS FARLEY, and 
<LI>My favorite joke:  Two little boys decide to learn to swear.  The older brother says, " I'll say hell & you say ass."  "OK" says the little brother, Just then their mother comes in and says, "Good morning boys.  What do you want for breakfast?"  The older brother says,"Aw hell, give me some Cheerios."  The mother is so shocked, she smacks him in the mouth & sends him crying to his room.  She then says to the little one, "And what do you want?"  To which he replied, "I don't know, ... but you can bet yo
r ass it won't be Cheerios!"
<LI>Roseanne beats everybody
<LI>Joseph Donato is the best comic these days, he gets to the point and we all had fun at his show. He's clean and harsh in the same sense. You have to see or hear him to have the laugh of your life. JD YOU ARE THE BESTEST <---as you would say PEACE
<LI>The Gaseous Wiener rules!
<LI>Dennis Miller very intellegent and funny.  Rosie's new show is great.  I like that she is not tring to be David Lettermen and is just being herself.

<LI>Ellen Degeneres is a goddess!
<LI>FAVORITE SITCOM:  ELLEN 
<LI>"Red Dwarf" and "Are You Being Served?" should be added to list of comedy shows!
<LI>Late Late Show w/Tom Snyder
<LI>Ellen is my favourite comedian - and my favorite joke is: Why did the chicken stop in the middle of the road?  Because it had a coffee table tied to it's leg!!
<LI>most comedy talk shows these days aren't very funny at all
<LI>Brit-coms are the best. Especially Red Dwarf and Blackadder.

<LI>Denis Leary
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnel Show

<LI>The Drew Carey show is the best of the new sitcoms
<LI>ab fab is one of the best comedy show
<LI>Q: ow many republicans does it take to change a lightbulb?  A: Before addressing this issue let me say unequivocably that we republicans had nothing to do with the lights going out; we're inclined to correct the democrats mistakes, as long as everyone is aware that it's entirely their fault, and by the way, this will require an additional $7 Trillion defense budget so we can protect the national security of our bulb manufacturing resources.

Only takes one....he's still pulling.....................so long!!

<LI>Brett Butler is my favorite female comedian.
<LI>The Best Comedie show on tv is The Rosie O' Donnel Show!

<LI>Sinbad, Phil Hartman, Greg Kinnear, Best Show- Newsradio
<LI>All in the Family - easily the funniest sitcom ever!

Then the devil asked the Texan " how was that?"  the texan replied " Just like a mild day in Houston"  So this time the devil got really mad and turned the thermostat way down.

<LI>Married...With Children is another popular sitcom!
<LI>Mark Lowrey is the funniest, cleanest comedian I have seen
<LI>3rd Rock From the Sun
<LI>Considering the number of recordings sold by Jerry Clower, he certainly should have been included.  Of course, Mississippi seems easily forgotten!  Also, Rush Limbaugh has a larger audience than any talk show listed; some have already bit the dust from lack of audience.
<LI>Might be fun to ask about specific movies
<LI>Lily Tomlin
<LI>two guys walk into a bar. . . one of them ducks!!

She agrees to do it!  They go to Tessie's room, and he puts his hand in her panties.  She asks him "So how old am I'?  He answers, "you are 83

<LI>What do you call a dog with no legs?    - Doesn't matter, he won't come anyway.

<LI>Where is Adam Sandler? The man is a riot.
<LI>Paul Reiser and _Mad About You_ should definately be among these choices.
<LI>Tim Cavanaugh ("99 Dead Baboons") performance was one of the best I've been too. You should try to hear his parody on "Proud Mary" about the Christmas story. Bob Rivers Comedy Group and Capital Steps produce some great comedy songs, too.
<LI>Elen DeGenres
<LI>Paul Reiser is the funniest stand up comedian, great sitcom and good book "Couplehood" you shouldn't leave him out !

<LI>Did you hear the one about the web survey site that actually asked its survey participants to submit jokes?  What is UP with that?
<LI>Bobcat Golthwait

<LI>You haven't included the best of them all!  Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  Save MST3k!!
<LI>Comedy today mostly needs to be cleaned up
<LI>Prairie Home Companion (Radio!) is the best comedy today.
<LI>Monty Python, by far . . .
<LI>Bill Clinton - What a Joke!
<LI>Martin Lawerence is the SHIT!
<LI>One word - Taxi

<LI>My favorite entertainment is stand-up comedy.  In the last 8 years I have only missed 10 shows in a local club that has shows weekly and for 4 and 1/2 years the shows were twice a week.  Laughing is the best form of therapy in a very serious, frustrating existence.
<LI>male standup: Robin Williams; female standup: Brett Butler; comedy venue:Comic Theatre/Vaudeville; Comedy Troupe: The Flying Karamazov Brothers; 
<LI>I didn't see Bill Murray's name.  Groundhog Day had me in tears of laughter!

<LI>Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie - damn fine tv show in canada (only 5 episodes aired)
<LI>The Drew Carey Show
<LI>The Dick Van Dyke Show and Dick Van Dyke, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Mary Tyler Moore--HOW COULD YOU LEAVE THESE TWO OUT???
<LI>Suzanne Westenhoeffer
<LI>John Candy was one of the finest comic actors of this generation.  He should be recognized here somewhere.  
<LI>spalding gray. i love a man with a good macula pucker

<LI>Gotta love that Gilbert Gottfried, no? And Woody Allen. He'" And I watched EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of the Paula Poundstone Show, a fact I trumpet with pride.
<LI>"Dilbert" or "Calvin & Hobbs"
<LI>your mama is so stupid she put a peephole in a glass door
<LI>Rhett Butler
<LI>ELLEN is my fave sitcom
<LI>The vast majority of current comedians are insulting and boorish rather than funny. 
<LI>The top ten male comics are funnier than any of the female comics on the list
<LI>I particularly enjoy improvisational comedy, the cutting edge of comedy in my opinion.  Shows like "Who's Line Is it Anyway?" are just the beginning.  Second City shows, The Groundlings and Monks' Night Out are the future of comedy.
<LI>ought to include bill cosby
<LI>Howard Stern's Morning Radio Show is excellent !!!!!
<LI>My favorite female comedienne is Brett Butler
<LI>i think you should add gallagher to the list!!!!!
<LI>Frasier would have to be about the most intelectually stimulating comdey entertainment we've watched....period.
<LI>I like Janeane Garofalo.
<LI>John Candy was/is my favorite...no one can replace his humanity
<LI>the carol burnette show and all in the family were the best
<LI>It wouldn't fit.
<LI>I absolutely love "Living Single".
<LI>A nun walks into a bar with a duck under her arm...
