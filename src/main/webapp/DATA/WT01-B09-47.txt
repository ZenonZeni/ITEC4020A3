<p>The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC) is a non-profit association of public and private companies and agencies, working to promote the advance of alternative fuel vehicle technologies in the Northeast United States.</p>



<p>	<b>NAVC's mission includes:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> strengthening the Northeast economy by allowing for the transfer of existing workforce skills out of exclusively defense related areas and into highly skilled clean-fuel vehicle related jobs with commercial/defense dual-use marketing potential;</p>
<p><li> meeting the region's air quality goals through the use of clean-fueled vehicles;</p>
<p><li> taking advantage of the Northeast's wealth of technology innovators and get them working together.</p></ul>




<p>In partnership with DARPA, NAVC is now managing over $32 million in alternative vehicle technology initiatives.</p>

<p>Through NAVC, this diverse group of organizations can move forward, linked by a common interest in furthering technologies for clean air, sustainable energy/energy security, technological competitiveness and economic development.

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	NAVC has expanded its program of advanced transportation technology with nine new projects for 1996.  This latest addition to the program brings the total of NAVC-managed projects to nearly 50.</p>

<ul>

<b><p>The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project</p></b>

<p>	An ongoing NAVC project that, due to its impressive results thus far, has received funding under this award to expand its program.  The project is managed by EVermont and the Atlantic Center for the Environment.  Vermont's cold, rural environment makes it ideal for the testing and development of advanced thermal management technologies vital to the successful operation of military and civilian EVs.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-7d.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-7c.gif"></a><center><b>NAVC has provided funding for this charging station which supports a fleet of electric pickup trucks and vans at Hanscom Air Force Base.</b></center></blockquote></p><br clear=all><br>





<b><p>Nickel Metal Hydride Battery Testing in a Cold Weather Environment</p></b>
<p>	Research by Michigan's Ovonic Battery Company has shown no performance loss in nickel metal hydride batteries in temperatures as low as -20 degrees Fahrenheit.  In this project, the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources and EVermont will test this finding in day-to-day applications.  The initiative also involves testing the nickel metal hydride batteries in hot weather.
</p>

<b><p>Conversions of Sport Utility Vehicles</p></b>

<p>	The New York City Department of Environmental Protection, Wilmington, Massachusetts-based Solectria Corp., Boston Edison, and Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Massachusetts will collaborate on a series of conversions to optimized electric vehicles.  The conversions will be performed at Solectria, followed by testing and analysis at Hanscom AFB, then delivery to New York City and Boston for operation and data collection.  Solectria plans to add the converted sport utility vehicle to its product line, to be available at reduced cost for both military and civilian applications.</p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-7f.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-7e.gif"></a><center><b>NAVC is funding development and crash testing of the Solectria Sunrise all-composite electric vehicle.</b></center></blockquote></p><br clear=all><br>

			

<b><p>High Efficiency, High Voltage DC Motor/Controller Design and Development</p></b>

<p>The revolutionary technology results in a motor/controller that exceeds the performance of current technology, yet costs less to produce and also eliminates the need for a conventional transmission. Solectria is working on several concepts in this program.</p>

<b><p>Integrated High Voltage Power Electronic Module</p></b>
<p>	Will provide dramatic cost reduction, simplified installation, and increased safety.</p>

<b><p>Single-Processor Fully Digital AC Motor Controller</p></b>
<p>	Involves redesigning the motor controller to make it fully digital, add computational power, and lower the cost.  The process will simplify manufacturing and produce a more efficient and user-friendly motor/controller system.</p>

<b><p>Horizon Battery/Vehicle Validation</p></b>
<p>	Using Horizon batteries, a battery management system and other related technologies, the system will feature increased range and improved life.  The ambitious initiative aims to establish market viability in just six months.</p>

<b><p>High Voltage Variable Speed AC to AC Motor Drives</p></b>
<p>	D.C. Transformation, Inc. of Beverly, Massachusetts, is doing ground-breaking work on motor drives for military applications.  This project will include a traction drive inverter demonstration.  The payoff of this amazing technology is reduced weight and volume, extreme cost reduction, increased efficiency and superior regulation, control and protection capabilities.</p>

<b><p>Electric Vehicle Monitoring and Display System Commercialization</p></b>
<p>	To be developed by New London, Connecticut's Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, the Thomas G. Faria Corporation of Uncasville, Connecticut, and Solectria Corp.  The team will use their combined expertise to develop a cost-effective instrumentation panel to be used in the Solectria Sunrise, but also adaptable to other vehicles.</p>

</ul><p>	NAVC has also had great success recently with ongoing projects.  A notable example is the NAVC-sponsored Solectria Sunrise, which recently added crashworthiness to its list of remarkable achievements.  The 4-passenger sedan had extremely encouraging results in crash testing.  The damage to both the vehicle and the crash-test dummies were well within allowable limits.  </p>
<p>	Production composite vehicle structures are of great interest to the military for stealth and lightweight strength.  </p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	NAVC will continue outreach to further the DARPA military needs of low-cost hybrid and electric vehicle technology and continue to meet the needs of the Northeast for economic development and cleaner air.</p>
