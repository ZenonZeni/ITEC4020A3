<B>Hydrogen Production from High-Moisture-Content Biomass in

Supercritical Water;<br>

<P>

Wet biomass (plants such as water hyacinth, banana trees, cattails,

green algae, and kelp) grows rapidly and abundantly around the

world.  For example, water hyacinth produces more than 100 tons

per hectare per year of dry organic matter.  However, wet biomass

is not regarded as a promising feedstock for conventional thermochemical


energy-conversion processes because the cost of drying the material

is too high.  Our research addresses this problem by using water

as the medium for converting the biomass to gas.

<P>

Previous work in this area showed that low concentrations of a

model compound (glucose) and various wet biomass species could

be completely gasified in supercritical water at 600&#176;C and

34.5 MPa (5,000 psi) after 30 seconds.  But higher concentrations

of glucose resulted in incomplete conversion.  For this reason,

we constructed flow reactors that could accommodate packed beds

of catalyst and initiated studies of the steam reforming (gasification)

reactions in the presence of various candidate catalysts.  Our

goal is to identify active catalysts for steam reforming biomass

slurries in supercritical water.  The gaseous products (primarily

hydrogen, CO<sub>2</sub>, and methane) separate from the water upon 
cooling

at the reactor exit and are then available for storage or further

processing at a pressure of 34.5 MPa.

<P>

Soon after tests began, we discovered a suitable class of carbon-based

catalysts.  These catalysts promote complete conversion (&gt;99%)

of high-concentration glucose (up to 22% by weight) to a hydrogen-rich

synthesis gas.  The catalyst we used, which is stable over a period

of several hours, exists in many forms and is inexpensive.  After

discovering this catalyst, we focused our work on four interrelated

tasks: (1) tests to identify the most active form and composition

of the catalyst; (2) tests employing the catalyst to study the

effect of feedstock composition on carbon conversion and gas 
composition;

(3) studies of catalyst deactivation and reactivation; and (4)

design and fabrication of a new, larger reactor with a slurry

feeder to handle high-concentration, wet biomass feedstocks.

<P>

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>: 

<P>Several long-resident-time (up to 24 hours) carbon activation

experiments were performed at a higher temperature (650&#176;C).

 These experiments were designed to achieve further carbon conversion

than previously at 600&#176;C and shorter residence times.  The

purpose is to examine the effect of residence time on surface

area and activity.  A reproduction experiment of glycerol gasification

without a catalyst at 600&#176;C, 34.5 MPa, was conducted to investigate


the reasons for the inconsistency of the water-gas shift reaction.

 Wall effect and mass transfer effect on the gasification of the

glycerol (2M) were examined.  An activation experiment was conducted

utilizing 0.8 M hydrogen peroxide as a reactant to oxidize the

packed activated carbon at 295&#176;C, 34.5 MPa.  The iodine numbers

of the activated carbon before and after the experiment will indicate

whether such a process is effective in activating the carbon.
