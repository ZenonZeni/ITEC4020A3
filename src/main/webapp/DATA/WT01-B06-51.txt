<h2 align=center>Quicken Financial Planner</h2>
<hr>

<strong>Reviewed by Michael Gutierrez</strong><p>

One new product not covered in the comparison that has generated inquiries from many of our members is the new Quicken Financial Planner produced by Intuit. This Windows-based CD-ROM product is priced at a reasonable $39.95 and is unique in that it is a stand-alone product that can directly link with its parent product, Quicken. This allows you to extract detailed information such as your individual investments and loan information. Not only do you save time, but you can also track your investments in greater detail using Quicken.<p>

Like Quicken Deluxe on CD-ROM, the Financial Planner includes multimedia tutorials on asset allocation, the advantages of starting a retirement plan early, the advantages of tax-deferred versus taxable investing, and the differences between investing in cash, bonds,  and stocks. In addition to the multimedia tutorial from Jane Bryant Quinn, there are help buttons in every folder of the program to provide assistance or insight on topics you reference.<p>

The multimedia tutorials provide the user with solid fundamentals on planning for retirement. Ms. Quinn competently describes different basic investment strategies that a user might need in the various stages of life. She is also quite helpful in describing the impact of different retirement years on Social Security benefits. These tutorials are an excellent addition to the program, providing needed information that might not otherwise be easily obtained.<p>

The program visually resembles a handheld planner with tabs separating each category, and sub-tabs defining the individual steps taken in each category. It opens with a short introduction and takes you through entering personal as well as spousal information, which is, of course, optional (see <A HREF="fig1.gif">Figure 1</A>).<p>


<h3>Taxes and Inflation</h3>

In this area, you detail your tax and inflation concerns. Both pre- and post-retirement tax rates are entered, in addition to an expected inflation rate. Estimates of your average tax rate as determined by demographics are provided by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based tax research organization. A graph depicting the trend in inflation over the last 68 years is also included for your perusal, in addition to an assumed average inflation rate of 4%, which may be modified by the user.<p>


<h3>Assets</h3>

The program breaks down your total assets into three categories: home, investments, and special assets. Your investments can be any stock, bond, mutual fund, or cash equivalent invested in either a taxable or tax-deferred account. The data may be entered directly, or imported from Quicken.<p>

Although the program allows you to enter your investment information, it is not meant to be a portfolio management tool. This type of function would be found in the regular Quicken product. In the Quicken Financial Planner, you simply enter the total value of your individual investments. A field is provided for you to enter the purchase price (or cost) of your investment, but the program will not produce any performance reports or provide you with a percent gain figure. However,  this information is not necessary and the lump-sum information entered is more than adequate when using this data for retirement planning.<p>

The home section factors in your primary residence, in addition to its planned sale or the purchase of another home for living or income.<p>

The special assets section is for assets that you currently own and are willing to sell to fund your retirement (excluding real estate, but including cars, boats, etc.).<p>

Specific tax-deferred and taxable savings other than investments are entered separately in the Planned Savings section.<p>


<h3>Loans</h3>

Next, you enter your loan information. Again, this information may be imported from Quicken or entered by hand. Information of this type would include loans for college tuition and vehicle purchases.<p>

This topic does not include a multimedia presentation. However, it offers a page of useful information about borrowing versus paying cash. It also provides many useful hints about debt consolidation, margin loans, borrowing against your home or life insurance policy, and credit card debt, which are helpful for those who have a good deal of outstanding debt they want to control.<p>


<h3>Income</h3>

Income can be entered on an individual basis or for both you and your spouse. Anticipated future changes in salary may be entered to compensate for an expected job change or promotion. One time inflows of money can be entered in the special income section, in addition to other taxable incomes such as rents or fund distributions.<p>

A multimedia presentation describing the intricacies of salary growth and making realistic projections is provided, along with a wealth of information on gifts, inheritances, and other unusual incomes. Tax considerations are also considered in regard to these topics.<p>

Incomes will automatically increase by the inflation rate.<p>


<h3>Expenses</h3>

Expenses can be entered either in a lump-sum figure, or in a list of itemized expenditures. Twenty-five predefined variables are included, with the ability to create as many new ones as necessary. (These can also be imported from Quicken.)<p>

Modifications can be made to living expenses both before and after retirement, making it easy for the user to see how expenses may differ in retirement. Depending on your situation, many of your expenses will be rearranged after retirement. For example, you may sell your home and purchase a condominium, which will alter your mortgage payments, or your costs of clothing may go down while vacation costs may increase, etc.<p>

One-time outflows of money can be entered in the special expenses section (such as a vacation) in addition to multiple expenditures (such as college tuition payments).<p>

For those living beyond their means or suffering from debt overload, Ms. Quinn provides some very helpful savings tips, such as consolidating credit card debt into a home equity loan at a lower percentage rate; or utilizing the automatic investment feature of mutual funds to augment savings.<p>


<h3>Retirement Benefits</h3>

To record the Social Security benefits of you and your spouse, you can enter a rough estimate (with default values provided), or obtain an estimate from the Social Security Administration (a request form is provided with the program).<p>

If you need a copy of your earnings and benefits statement, it can be obtained from the Social Security Administration by calling (800) 772-1213, or by writing to: SSA, Wilkes Barre Data Operations Center, P.O. Box 7004, Wilkes Barre, Penn. 18767-7004. These benefits can be adjusted if you believe the amount will grow more slowly in the future or eventually be reduced.<p>

Pension plan benefits for both you and your spouse can also be estimated.<p>


<h3>Planned Returns</h3>

Next, you need to determine both your pre- and post-retirement investment rates of returns historical and projected figures are provided for whatever return you expect to have. A far more accurate method for accomplishing this would have been to enter the expected returns for each investment on an individual basis. At this point, the program will only accept a lump-sum rate of return on all investments in all categories (tax-exempt, tax-deferred, and taxable).<p>

I might add here that the program does not provide for the entry of a tax-exempt status, just taxable and tax-deferred. To get around this, you can enter tax-exempt investments under special assets in the assets table.<p>


<h3>Results</h3>

Once all information is entered, the results of your retirement plan will be presented in both graphical and numerical report format. You may view these for cash flow, income, expenses, savings, withdrawal, portfolio, and net worth in either today's dollars or dollars at retirement (see <A HREF="fig2.gif">Figure 2</A>).<p>

If you find that you do not have enough funds to see your way through retirement, there is an adjustments page that allows you to change several different variables and see the impact it has on your retirement income. Factors include inflation, retirement age, life expectancy, and percent contributions to tax-deferred and taxable savings. The returns on these investments are presented for modification.<p>

A thermometer bar provides a graphical depiction of your investments at retirement, and a numerical amount specified in today's dollars is also given.<p>


<h3>Action Plan</h3>

The action plan section provides a detailed plan for your savings that is necessary to make your retirement plan work. Also provided is a breakdown of your investments (both taxable and tax-deferred) as they currently stand, in addition to a rebalancing of these investments provided by the program.<p>

This rebalancing is broken down into domestic bonds, domestic stocks, global bonds, and international stocks. The results are displayed in both a pie chart and tabular format.<p>

Another presentation provided by Ms. Quinn stresses the importance of starting your savings plan as soon as possible and to sticking to your plan once it is implemented.<p>


<h3>Other Extras</h3>

A nice feature that has been integrated into the programs is the mutual fund data provided by Morningstar (see <A HREF="fig3.gif">Figure 3</A>s). Performance data on over 4,400 mutual funds is included on a year-to-date, one-year, three-year, five-year, and 10-year basis, including returns in comparative indexes such as the S&P 500 and categories of funds such as domestic stock and international stock.<p>

Risk and ratings, fees and expenses, investment style, and general information about the funds are also included. Bar graphs encompassing a 10-year time frame are provided for individual funds, comparing them to appropriate benchmarks on either yearly or cumulative returns. A second graph shows if a fund ranks in the top 25%, 50%, or 75% of all funds by return.<p>

Another nice feature is that in places where numerical values are expected to be entered by the user, an on-screen keypad is provided for easier data entry.<p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The program is very easy to use and includes many helpful tips. It even provides a high degree of flexibility that other programs do not. For instance, you can specify an early retirement, but choose not to collect Social Security until a later date. Furthermore, the separate and individual workspaces for information on you and your spouse enable you to make real-life situations easier to calculate, such as if your spouse was out of work for an extended period of time and recently got a new job.<p>

Although the program did describe the effects of early retirement (before 65) and late retirement (after 72) it does not provide a warning for the user that benefits will be reduced. It is therefore a good idea to go through the tutorials and help sections (even if you are familiar with a topic) in every folder. Not only will this help clarify the many different facets of retirement planning, but it will also provide you with useful and significant information for making the most of the program.<p>

What should you do if your retirement benefit calculations put you right on the border? It might be tempting to say, "Well, we'll just earn more income in these next few years," or "We'll assume that there will be no inflation for these next few years." However, it is important that the changes you make in the assumptions table and the "what-if" analysis section are valid assumptions or even worst-case scenarios. Earning more income or an above market rate of return sounds easier than it really is, and it is highly doubtful that the inflation rate will drop much below the 4% level, let alone down to zero. Remember to manipulate variables that are within your power to change, such as cutting back on some of those expensive dinners or (terrible as it may seem) retiring a year or two later.<p>
