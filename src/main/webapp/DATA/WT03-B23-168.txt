<P>
When you hire a portfolio manager to manage
your investments, you're hiring someone to relieve you of the
burden of trying to manage your own portfolio -- a full-time
money manager. It's their responsibility to develop a clear and
concise, long-term strategy that meets your individual needs and
to implement this strategy by structuring a customized portfolio.
Private money managers have access to a much broader and varied
range of research than most individual investors do. They also
have the talent and discipline to use this information effectively.
The right investment manager can help you achieve the performance
you expect while keeping risks to a minimum.
