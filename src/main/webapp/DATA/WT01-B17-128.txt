	<a name="addi"><h4>ADDICTIONS.</h4></a> Toxic chemicals stored in the blood and body tissues pose a serious threat to mental and physical health and underlie many otherwise baffling medical problems, including addictions, states Zane Gard, M.D. Dr. Gard treated a male teenager, aged 14, who exhibited long-term emotional and behavioral problems including uncontrollable anger and belligerence. This condition was the result of the teenager’s chronic exposure to chemicals used by his mother in her painting business. The youth resorted to marijuana and cocaine as a means of coping with the disturbing changes he was experiencing in himself, says Dr. Gard.  Conventional interventions, including a school rehabilitation program, failed to improve the teenager’s condition.<p>
	Dr. Gard put him on his BioToxic Reduction Program™ which emphasized detoxification through heat (called hyperthermia) to stimulate the body’s excretion of toxins. Dr. Gard’s program includes dry sauna (ventilated thermal chamber), nutritional supplementation, massage, electroacuscope therapy (an energy medicine device that reduces pain by stimulating tissue repair), and enzyme therapy. The idea is to get the patient to perspire more, to increase the blood circulation, and to move toxic residues from the fatty tissues into the bloodstream for elimination from the body. <p>
	The detoxification flushing program continues for 3-4 weeks, accompanied by exercise, prolonged perspiration, and substance abuse counseling. Following the detoxification program, Dr. Gard found the teenager notably improved in attitude and mental clarity, and free of drugs; in addition, he returned to being “a loving, thoughtful person.”<p>

	<a name="aids"><h4>AIDS.</h4></a>  After 10 years of clinical experience with 165 AIDS patients,  H.E. Sartori, M.D., and H. Hugh Fudenberg, M.D., conclude that treatment with ozone and a multimodal program can produce a 95% success rate in terms of normalizing laboratory test results and the physical and mental well-being of patients. <p>
	They call their AIDS treatment  approach Life Science Universal (LSU) and it includes a 12-day ozone program (30-35 mg daily of ozone per 154 pounds of body weight, delivered intravenously), supplementation with vitamins, minerals, and herbs, psychological counseling, “reconditioning” (which involves a 12-step goal-setting program), internal energy exercises, and a mostly vegetarian diet with no dairy products. In an addition, they use 8 adjunctive therapies, such as homeopathy, Chinese herbs, acupuncture, coffee enemas, heat therapy, thymus extracts, and feedback control electrical stimulation (including ear acupuncture using electric currents), when needed. <p>
	Of 119 patients for whom post-treatment laboratory results were available,  53 (45%) had their T4 immune cells return to normal; other key blood factors also became normal again. For another 46 patients (39%), their T-cell count increased by at least 200. Of 91 patients graded HIV-positive, 75% saw their conditions change to HIV-negative after completing the program. Most of the patients receiving this treatment “showed a significant improvement of their general well-being and of most of their clinical symptoms,” state Drs. Sartori and Fudenberg.<p>

	<a name="alzh"><h4>ALZHEIMER’S.</h4></a> Dr. Jörg Birkmayer, M.D., of Vienna, Austria, conducted a clinical trial with 17 Alzheimer’s patients, treating them for 8-12 weeks with NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). First identified in 1934, this is a coenzyme chemical, naturally found in human cells which is necessary for energy production. In Alzheimer’s patients, NADH cellular activity is 25%-50% lower than in healthy individuals of comparable age. Therefore, boosting NADH levels of Alzheimer’s patients should reduce the symptoms and halt the development of Alzheimer’s, states Dr. Birkmayer.<p>
	Dr. Birkmayer gave NADH at a dosage of 10 mg once a day, 30 minutes before breakfast.  After only 2 weeks of NADH treatment, Dr. Birkmayer observed a 240% increase in NADH activity at the cellular level in his patients; there were also noticeable improvements in their mental functions. Various clinical tests of mental ability further revealed dramatic improvements, even in those patients who had the most severe form of dementia. In over 3000 individuals who have taken NADH, not a single side effect has been reported; NADH appears to be safe even at levels 7000 times higher than the recommended dose, says Dr. Birkmayer. <p>

	<a name="arth"><h4>ARTHRITIS.</h4></a> New clinical studies (1995) from Sun Yet Sen University of Medical Sciences in China have shown that devil’s claw root extract can bring relief for osteoarthritis. A total of 40 patients (aged 38-52) received daily dosages of Pagosid™, a standardized water-based extract of devil’s claw root, for 4 weeks at the dosage rate of 500 mg daily. Drs. Yin Peida and Yang Xiuyan  reported that it had a positive effect in 5 major areas, such as relieving inflammation, reducing swelling, and improving joint mobility. The doctors rated the effectiveness of the herbal therapy at 85%, while the patients rated it 90%. <p>
	In a parallel study (1995) of 38 patients, doctors at the First Military Medical University, also in China, gave arthritis patients one gram of Pagosid every day for 4 weeks. The doctors rated Pagosid 79% effective as patients reported relief from their arthritic conditions, including joint swelling, morning stiffness, and lowered grip strength. The effectiveness rating for osteoarthritis was 85%; for rheumatoid arthritis, 75%; and for ankylosing spondylitis, 67%. The patients rated Pagosid’s general effectiveness slightly higher, at 81.5%, and for arthritis specifically at 85%.<p>
	A third study (1995) conducted by Drs. Cui Jinfang and Shi Puzhen at the People’s Hospital of Guandong Province in China, involved 58 osteoarthritis patients who took one gram of Pagosid every day for 2-4 weeks. Pagosid produced an 86.7% improvement in their osteoarthritis symptoms. The only side effect noted was a mild, generalized, scattered skin rash in one patient out of 58.<p>

	<a name="asth"><h4>ASTHMA.</h4></a> Childhood asthma may be an allergic reaction to impaired digestion and lack of proper enzymes, reports Jonathan V. Wright, M.D., of Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington. He bases this on his treatment of Bobby, aged 7, who had suffered with asthma for most of his life.<p>
	In the past 2 years, Bobby had been rushed to the hospital 5 times for asthma attacks and he used his inhaler frequently. Previous doctors had him eliminate dairy products, sugars, food chemicals, and refined carbohydrates, and to rotate specific foods. In addition, Bobby’s parents give him daily dosages of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg in 3 doses), magnesium (125 mg, 3 times), vitamin B6 (50 mg, 3 times), vitamin C (1000 mg, 3 times), a high-potency multiple vitamin-mineral (1/3 adult dosage, 3 times), and cod liver oil (1 tablespoon). This regimen had improved his condition by only about 50% when they brought him to Dr. Wright.<p>
	Dr. Wright pointed out that research published in 1931 showed that of 200 asthmatic children, 80% had digestive problems, specifically, low amounts of pepsin and hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This deficiency slows down digestion and nutrient absorption and turns foods into allergy-producing substances in the body; the allergies then generate the asthma.  Also, when the stomach functions poorly, vitamin B12 absorption is limited when taken orally. <p>
	Dr. Wright gave Bobby vitamin B12 through injections, knowing that for 50% of his patients, this approach eliminates wheezing, and for 30%, it produces major improvements. Six months later when Bobby’s wheezing was gone, Dr. Wright had him take pepsin and hydro-chloric acid tablets, keeping the vitamin B12 injections at maintenance level and continuing with the oral supplements described above. “All of this was several years ago, and he remains free of asthma,” states Dr. Wright.<p>

	<a name="auti"><h4>AUTISM.</h4></a> Childhood autism may be successfully treated in some cases by applying antifungal drugs, according to the results of a research team at The Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, headed by William Shaw, Ph.D., and Enrique Chaves, M.D. Urine analysis of autistic children suggests there may be a metabolic factor involved in the onset of autism, state the doctors.<p>
	 In other words, autistic patients may be infected and even colonized with fungi and yeast that may be adversely affecting their behavior. Chief among the metabolic by-products discovered in the urine are tartaric and citramlic acids, which come from yeasts. In addition, the doctors found traces of 4 substances derived from fungi. <p>
	On this basis, Drs. Shaw, Chaves, and colleagues treated a small number of autistic children for yeast infection, giving them Mycostatin, a conventional drug used for yeast and fungus infections (also called Nystatin®), at the rate of 100,000 units, 4 times daily for 10 days, given orally. If a follow-up urine sample still indicates traces of yeast and fungus, then a second course of Mycostatin for 2 months is recommended, state Drs. Shaw and Chaves. If  traces of yeast and fungus persist, then the child receives treatment with fluconazole (called Diflucan®) at the rate of 2 mg per 2.2 pounds body weight, given as a single daily dose for 2 weeks.<p>
	A recent study of 19 autistic children conducted by Drs. Shaw, Chaves, and colleagues has produced “favorable responses from the antifungal drug therapy, sometimes within a few days of beginning therapy.” Improvements noted include reduced hyperactivity, better sleep and concentration, and more eye contact and speaking ability. At the same time, for the children with the highest levels originally, the urine concentrations of fungal and yeast declined by 80-95% within the first 10 days of treatment.<p>

	<a name="back"><h4>BACK PAIN.</h4></a> John Parks Trowbridge, M.D., developed low back pain while training as a track runner at the age of 14. Weekly chiropractic sessions for 5 years failed to eliminate the constant ache and pain. Conventional doctors told him he had inflammation and degeneration in his discs and prescribed painkillers; these fogged his brain but did not stop the pain. When he was 23, he developed severe sciatica down his left leg and spent 2 weeks in the hospital taking strong medications. The painful sciatica periodically returned in the following years. <p>
	A further series of accidents and spontaneous injuries made Dr. Trowbridge’s back pain far worse. Neck and low back surgery failed to produce lasting improvement. He became so debilitated that all movement was painful.<p>
	Dr. William Faber, D.O., of the Milwaukee Pain Clinic, began treating Dr. Trowbridge, using reconstructive and neural-fascial therapy. Dr. Faber slowly injected a solution of sodium morrhuate and the anesthetic procaine (up to 100 different solutions are available) into the area of discomfort in the patient’s body, typically at the site where the bone meets the joint. The solution stimulates the body to begin reconstructing the connective tissue.<p>
	As soon as the injections were complete, Dr. Trowbridge began feeling relief from the deep, aching pain in his back and leg. Over the next weeks, after 3 treatments his neck and back muscles began to strengthen, his need for chiropractic adjustments and conventional medications was reduced, and he felt confident he would not relapse, as he had so often in the previous 25 years. “My back and neck are truly better in every single way as a direct result of these wonderful, tiny but powerful injection treatments,” stated Dr. Trowbridge.<p>

	<a name="colo"><h4>COLON CANCER.</h4></a> A diagnosis of colon cancer does not have to mean surgery and the discomfort of colostomy, states Edward Leyton, M.D., of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Dr. Leyton treated William, aged 62, who came to him with a diagnosis of colon cancer. He had gnawing abdominal pains, severe coughing spasms, mucus, pus, and bleeding from the bowel. However, William did not want surgery and was willing to try  alternatives. <p>
	First Dr. Leyton put William on a special diet, excluding meats, dairy products, wheat, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, drugs, processed foods, and sugars, and emphasizing fresh vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes. <p>
	Then Dr. Leyton prescribed a series of nutritional supplements, including Ultrabalance™ Protein Formula (2 tablespoons, 3 times daily); Herbulk™ (3 tablespoons, 3 times daily); Viokase® (lipase enzymes, 2 tablespoons, 2 times daily, with meals); selenium (200 µg daily); zinc gluconate ( 50 mg daily); vitamin E (400 I.U. daily); vitamin C (4000 mg daily); bovine adrenal and thymus extract; and beta carotene (50,000 I.U. daily). In addition, William gave himself 5 water enemas and one coffee enema every day to stimulate the excretion of toxins from his intestines and liver.<p>
	The treatment succeeded. Technically, this means William’s cancer has been controlled, not cured, but not only is William still alive and healthy 8 years after his diagnosis, he is able to work 12-hour days as a farmer. His bowel symptoms return in much reduced form only when he deviates from his diet. William has already lived more than 5 years beyond the “expected” survival time for this type of cancer, states Dr. Leyton.  “He has had no conventional medical intervention, which means that his survival can only be due to nutritional or attitudinal changes.”<p>

	<a name="depr"><h4>DEPRESSION.</h4></a> The next time you hear a doctor say there is nothing physically wrong with somebody who has deep, prolonged depression, the clinical results of enzyme therapist Lita Lee, Ph.D., of Eugene, Oregon, should  give you grounds for reconsideration. According to Dr. Lee, a lack of suitable enzymes can produce depression.<p>
	Dr. Lee recently helped a woman, aged 50, who had been diagnosed with manic depression bipolar disorder and obsessive personality and  through a series of 12 psychiatric drugs, including Prozac and Lithium. She had gained 100 pounds, developed breast cancer, and become increasingly confused and depressed. Her condition was made worse by the drugs’ strong side effects, including nausea and bowel incontinence.  <p>
	On the basis of a urine analysis, Dr. Lee quickly saw that nutritional causes lay at the root of the woman’s depression. Specifically, these were a lack of protease enzymes (necessary to digest proteins), intolerance for sugar, an underactive thyroid, and a “junk-food” diet replete with sugar. Biochemically, undigested protein can produce anxiety, inability to digest sugars (sucrase), panic attacks and depression, while an underactive thyroid can reduce bodily energy, states Dr. Lee.<p>
	She put her client on 2 digestive formulas for sugar intolerance (containing lactase, sucrase, and maltase enzymes,  brewer’s yeast, gota kola, and borage); a protease enzyme formula (plus magnesium and calcium); a formula to drain the lymphatic system (rose hips, alfalfa, Echinacea); and a thyroid glandular supplement.<p>
	What happened was amazing, especially because this client was not particularly compliant,” notes Dr. Lee. Within 2-3 weeks of beginning the enzyme program, the woman became articulate once more, her humor returned, and all conditions began easing up. As long as she remains on the enzymes, her emotional condition remains stable, reports Dr. Lee.<p>

	<a name="gast"><h4>GASTRITIS.</h4></a> Ellen, aged 45, came to W. John Diamond, M.D., at Triad Medical Clinic in Reno, Nevada, having had severe abdominal, lower back, and groin pain for 3 years. Conventional physicians had diagnosed her condition as gastritis and prescribed a standard drug which helped very little; she discontinued it after 6 months. <p>
	Dr. Diamond used Electro-dermal screening (an energy medicine diagnostic device) to determine the full extent of Ellen’s condition, the energy picture for her body, and which remedies at which strengths would be best for her. Dr. Diamond’s examination also revealed that Ellen had previously had Herpes Zoster (shingles) which developed immediately after the death of her mother; the stomach pain followed. She also had chronic sinusitis and constipation.<p>
	Dr. Diamond, skilled in homeopathy and acupuncture, injected Ellen at 7 different acupuncture meridian points with a homeopathic vaccination (called a nosode) made from Herpes Zoster itself.  He also gave her 10 ampules of homeopathic Herpes Zoster nosode (in ascending strengths, from 6X to 200X) to take orally over several weeks. To provide direct relief of her symptoms, Dr. Diamond prescribed 2 additional homeopathic preparations, including Gastricumeel® (a commercial blend of 6 homeopathic remedies, 2 tablets 3 times daily) and Natrum Muriaticum (1 dose at 1M) for grief and stress triggered by the death of her mother. <p>
	The pain in her stomach went away first, followed by the groin discomfort. It is well known, though curious, that suppressed grief is associated with the onset of herpes which in this case infected the abdominal nerves, thereby producing the pain. “Follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 1 year revealed complete cessation of gastric pain,” states Dr. Diamond.<p>

	<a name="inte"><h4>INTESTINAL SLUGGISHNESS.</h4></a> Based on his clinical experience of working with 150 patients over a 4-year period, Brent W. Davis, D.C., is confident that cat’s claw (a Peruvian herb called Uncaria tomentosa or uña de gato) produces beneficial effects on the intestine. “I have seen cat’s claw break through severe intestinal derangements that no other available product can touch,” including diverticulitis, recurring ulcers, Crohn’s disease, irritable and leaky bowel syndrome, and depressed intestinal action, states Dr. Davis. <p>
	In addition, cat’s claw can clear up long-term parasitic infestations in the intestines involving Blastocystis hominis, entamoebas, and giardia, as if it were breaking up “metabolic log jams” thereby enhancing the effects of other therapies and medicines. Typically, cat’s claw can be administered in the range of 3-25 g daily, in tea or tablet form, states Dr. Davis. As a liquid extract, he usually gives it at the rate of 3 g daily, or 25 drops 3 times daily. Usually Dr. Davis does not exceed 5 g daily during an initial 10-14 day period. The only undesirable action of cat’s claw is that it can produce a loosening of the stools and even transient diarrhea; if this happens, the dosage is reduced.<p>

	<a name="meno"><h4>MENOPAUSE.</h4></a> Sonya, aged 44, complained of anxiety, body sweats, burning hot flashes, broken sleep, and an overactive, constantly “chewing” mind. In addition, she was bloated, her bowels were sluggish, she had missed her last 5 periods, her arms and wrists ached, sometimes feeling as if they were burning, her fingers and arms were numb on waking, sunlight irritated her, she felt hurried and disconnected all the time, and her appetite was voracious.<p>
	Homeopaths Robert Ullman, N.D., and Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman, N.D., M.S.W., gave Sonya homeopathic Iodum (from iodine), which is indicated for people with an overactive metabolism. Within 24 hours of the first dose, the rushed feeling and mental restlessness were gone, and within 2 weeks, Sonya reported that she was “back on track.” Her hot flashes disappeared and the wrist achiness and finger numbness went away. Two years later, none of the symptoms had returned.<p>

	<a name="mens"><h4>MENSTRUATION.</h4></a> Betty, aged 42, had suffered from painful menstruation since she was 14. She experienced gas, bloating, and irritability for at least a week before her period began. After a death in the family, her symptoms got worse. In fact, on the second day of menstruation, the pain was so strong and sudden (“like a labor pain,” she said), it made her cry out. She also had a drawing pain down her thighs, occasionally accompanied by prickly skin, which was the worse for scratching. Betty was 10 pounds overweight and unable to keep to a weight-reducing diet. Her emotions went up and down like a roller coaster and she was often teary.<p>
 	Homeopath Judith A. Lewis, R.N., N.D., gave Betty one dose of homeopathic Pulsatilla (10M). She cried for 3 hours, releasing emotional tension; her next period came without any of the usual discomfort, then lasted only 3 days instead of 5. Her next two periods were normal and pain-free for the first time in her life. Betty also lost 7 pounds, was more focused at work, and more emotionally calm, says Dr. Lewis.<p>

	<a name="pms"><h4>PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME.</h4></a>  Jane, aged 18, had considerable premenstrual difficulties including abdominal pain, bloating, cold sweats, disturbed sleep, headaches, lethargy, nausea, skin blemishes, and tension—a total of 22 major symptoms, according to British aromatherapy practitioner J. Noel Hulmston.  He developed a 6-month program of using aromatherapy oils for body massage to improve Jane’s condition.<p>
	For rubbing all across her back, Hulmston selected a 2% mix of equal amounts of chamomile and marjoram essential oils, prepared in a base of sweet almond oil. For massage on the front of her body, Hulmston had Jane use a 2% blend of lavender and clary sage, also in sweet almond oil. On her arms and shoulders, Jane used a 2% blend of rose (in a 10% reduction) mixed with lemongrass, in a sweet almond oil base; for her legs, a 2% mix of lavender and Ylang-ylang; and for her face, a 2% mix of neroli oil.<p>
	For the treatment Jane applied these oils on the appropriate body areas on days 10 and 5 before the onset of menstruation each month. After 2 months of this, Hulmston changed it to days 7 and 3 before menstruation. After 6 months of aromatherapy treatment, the most serious of Jane’s conditions were “markedly improved,” while her problem with skin blemishes had improved by 50%. In all,  89% of her original symptoms had ceased.<p>

	<a name="psor"><h4>PSORIASIS.</h4></a> William, aged 65, had suffered from psoriasis for 15 years. When chiropractor John O. A. Pagano, D.C., examined William, who also had a spinal problem, he was shocked to note the severity of the psoriasis. There were red splotches all over William’s back and thighs; these lesions bled, itched, and produced scales. Over the previous 15 years, Williams had visited a long list of specialists but had seen no improvement in his condition.<p>
	According to Dr. Pagano, who has successfully treated many hundreds of psoriasis cases, the problem is not in itself a skin disease. The intestinal walls, which have become thin and porous, leech toxins outwards towards the skin, passing first through the lymphatic system, bloodstream, and liver, eventually generating the psoriatic lesions.<p>
 	When the liver, the major filtering gland of the body, is overloaded, the skin comes to the rescue and helps to eliminate toxins,” states Dr. Pagano. A combination of factors—which include poor elimination, faulty diet, misaligned vertebrae, inadequate water intake, negative, unresolved emotions, and hereditary tendencies—produce psoriasis, he explains. <p>
	Dr. Pagano’s treatment plan includes internal cleansing (colonic irrigation of the intestines through regular enemas, a 3-day apple diet, liberal use of pure water, natural laxatives, and steam cabinets); a shift to a cleansing, nutritious diet, and the use of specific herb teas (such as saffron, slippery elm bark, chamomile, mullein, and watermelon seed); spinal adjustments; external applications (e.g., an olive-peanut oil mixture to apply to the skin, along with castor oil, Epsom salts baths, and ultraviolet light); and positive thinking.<p>
	William put Dr. Pagano’s treatment into action then returned in one week for an examination. His lesions were 50% improved; after 3 months, all his lesions had disappeared “as completely as if someone had used an eraser on his back,” states Dr. Pagano. William reported one year after ending his treatment, “I can honestly state that there has been no recurrence whatsoever.”<p>
