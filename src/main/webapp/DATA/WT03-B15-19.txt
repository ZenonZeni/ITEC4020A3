features.  If any of this information seems confusing or overly technical

<H2><A name="RSA">RSA Keypair Exchange</A>
</H2><P>NetShade uses <B>secret key encryption</B> to encrypt all the network
data sent
to and from each protected machine.  Secret key encryption methods use a
single
secret key to lock and unlock data.  Therefore, only the people with the
key can
decrypt it.  This key must, of course, be kept secret from all third parties.
<P>
Of course, the main problem with secret key encryption is finding a safe
way to
distribute the secret keys.  Fortunately, a number of methods have been developed
for secure key distribution.  We use one called the
<A
href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA public key cryptosystem</A>.
<P>
Instead of a single secret key, RSA uses a <B>keypair</B>, consisting of
a public
and a private key.  These keys are complements of one another; something
encrypted with the public key can be unlocked only with the private key,
and
something encrypted with the private key can only be unlocked with the public
key.
<P>
This is very useful.  In practice, the public key may be distributed freely
to
anyone (hence its name), whereas the private key is kept secret.  If Alice
wants
to send a message to Bob, she can encrypt it with his public key.  Once this
has
been done, no one (not even Alice) can unlock the message.  The only way
it can
be unlocked is with the private key, and Bob is the only one who knows this
key.
<P>
Likewise, if Bob wants to reply, he can encrypt a message with Alice's public
key; then, only she can unlock it (with her own private key).
<P>
NetShade uses the RSA cryptosystem to set up a <B>sealed session</B> between
any
two NetShade-equipped machines before they start to communicate over a network.
The first time these machines try to communicate, NetShade will generate
a new,
unique secret encryption key and exchange it using the two machines' RSA
keypairs.  The process works like this:
<P>
<H3>Step 1
</H3><P>Alice's machine sends a "log-in" request to Bob's machine.  This
request, which
is sent in the clear, contains Alice's public key and specifies the algorithm
that Alice wants to use for encryption (in this case, Alice has set DES as
her
active mode).  Remember, it doesn't matter who intercepts the public key;
it's OK
for everyone to see it.
<P>
<H3>Step 2
</H3><P>Next, Bob's machine -- which allows the DES communication mode --
generates a
secret DES key at random.  This key will be used to encrypt the network traffic
between the two machines.  The secret key is stored in the memory of Bob's
machine.
<P>
<H3>Step 3
</H3><P>Next, Bob encrypts the secret DES key using Alice's RSA public key.
 Bob's
machine then sends the encrypted key to Alice's machine.  Remember, no one
will
be able to steal the secret key as it travels across the network, since it
is
encrypted.
<P>
<H3>Step 4
</H3><P>Finally, Alice's machine decrypts the secret key using her RSA private
key.  At
this point, both machines have a copy of the secret key.  From this point
on, all
transmissions between the two machines will be encrypted with the secret
DES key.
<P>

<H2><A name="insecure">Handling Insecure Session Requests</A>
</H2><P>Most NetShade environments will include a mix of NetShade users and
unprotected
machines.  Since NetShade cannot establish secure sessions with unprotected
machines, having a greater number of unprotected machines on a network makes
it
more likely that someone will establish an insecure connection to your machine.
<P>
NetShade lets you decide how your machine will handle requests for insecure
sessions.  If you want to ensure that data from your machine can only be
sent
over a secure channel, you can tell NetShade to allow only secure (i.e.,
encrypted) connections with your machine.  If you wish to allow insecure
connections, you may choose to have NetShade warn you whenever someone
establishes such a connection with your machine.
<P><A name="fig1"><CENTER><IMG src="21.GIF"></CENTER></A>
<P>
In Figure 1, we see that Alice has configured NetShade to allow insecure
connections, but to warn her whenever an insecure session is about to take
place.
 By contrast, Bob has set his copy of NetShade to reject any attempt to set
up an
insecure session.  (Since Alice, Bob and Carl will all be using the server,
the
server's copy of NetShade has been set to allow all types of connections.)
<P>
In this situation, Alice will be able to establish secure connections with
Bob
and the server, since both of those machines are running NetShade.  If Alice
connects to Carl (or vice versa), she will be warned that an insecure connection
to her machine has been established.  Bob, on the other hand, will only be
able
to establish connections with Alice or the server; if he tries to establish
a
connection with Carl, NetShade will reject the connection.  Carl won't notice
anything unusual when connecting with Alice or the server, but he will receive
a
"remote machine not responding" message if he tries to connect with Bob.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="multi"></A>
<H2><A name="multi">Using Multiple Encryption Algorithms</A>
</H2><P>NetShade can establish several different types of secure sessions
simultaneously,
giving you even more flexibility in setting the level of security for each
machine on your network.  Figure 2 shows how the machines in our sample
configuration might take advantage of this flexibility.
<P>
<CENTER><A name="fig2"><IMG src="22.GIF"></A></CENTER>
<P>
Each copy of NetShade on this network is able to support four communication
modes.  Listed from least secure to most secure, those modes are: No encryption,
NightShade, DES, and Triple DES (NOTE: the standard version of NetShade only
includes the first two modes; DES and Triple DES are available separately
or with
the advanced NetShade Bundles).  From this list of available modes, each
user
determines which communication modes will be <B>allowed</B> with his or her
machine.  Any attempts to communicate with a machine using a mode that is
not
allowed will be rejected.
<P>
As Figure 2 shows, Alice's machine allows NightShade, DES and unencrypted
sessions to be established with her machine.  Bob wants more security on
his
machine, so he allows only Triple DES and DES connections.  The server allows
all
four communication modes.  (Since Carl is not running NetShade, he effectively
allows only unencrypted communication.)
<P>
On each NetShade machine, one of the allowed modes is always set as the
<B>active
mode</B>: the preferred method of communication for that machine.  (In Figure
2,
each user's active mode is marked with a star.)  Alice prefers to communicate
using NightShade, since it is the quickest secure algorithm available.  Bob
has
set his active mode to Triple DES, since it provides the most security.
<P>
Whenever a NetShade machine initiates a connection to another machine, it
tries
to establish that connection using its active mode.  If the receiving machine
does not allow that mode, the initiating machine tries to find a mode that
both
machines will allow.  If the recipient machine does not support any of the
connecting machine's allowed modes, the connection will not be established.
<P>
For example, suppose that Alice wants to connect to Bob's machine.  Her active
mode is NightShade, so she starts by trying to set up a NightShade session
with
Bob.  However, Bob doesn't allow the NightShade mode, so Alice's machine
tries to
find a mode that both parties will allow.  It turns out that the only mode
that
will work is DES, so NetShade establishes a DES session between Alice and
Bob.
<P>
Remember: all of these session negotiation functions happen in the background.
Each user merely connects to the desired machine using the standard method
(e.g.,
mounting a volume with the Chooser); everything else happens automatically
and
invisibly.
<P>

<A name="printers"></A>
<H2><A name="printers">Printers and Other Unencrypting Devices</A>
</H2><P>NetShade allows you to specify an "exception list" of devices that
can only
receive unencrypted data.  For example, since printers do not support encryption,
you can add your printer name to this list; even if you have set NetShade
to
disallow unencrypted communications, all data sent to the printer will be
unencrypted.
<P>
You can also add the name of a network user to this list.  In our sample
network
configuration, for example, Bob could add Carl's name to the exception list.
This would enable Bob and Carl to communicate insecurely, even though Bob
would
typically reject all attempts to establish an insecure session.
<P>
To use a printer and retain maximum network security, you can assign a computer
on your network to act as a dedicated "print spooler."  In this scenario,
the
printer is removed from the network and attached directly to the dedicated
computer; that computer's only job is to forward print jobs to the printer.
Since the print spooler can run NetShade, this setup allows you to send encrypted
print jobs over the network.
<P>

<A name="environment"></A>
<H2><A name="environment">NetShade Network Configurations</A>
</H2><P>
<H3>NetShade on a LAN
</H3><P>The examples presented in the earlier parts of this document
(<A
href="#fig1">Figure 1</A> and <A href="#fig2">Figure 2</A>) describe typical
NetShade-LAN environments.  Adding more or less users to this type of LAN
environment would have little impact on NetShade's performance, although
as more
network users start to run NetShade, the overall security of the LAN traffic
will
rise accordingly.
<P>
<H3>NetShade on a WAN
</H3><P>Running NetShade on a wide-area network (WAN) is fairly similar to
the LAN
configuration.  Figure 3 shows a typical NetShade-WAN arrangement.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="23.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
In a wide-area network, multiple networks are connected using a device called
a
<B>router</B>.  When a machine on one network sends data to a machine on
another
network, it is passed through the router, which determines where the data
needs
to be forwarded.
<P>
Since many routers are designed to forward data over insecure public channels
--
e.g., the Internet or telephone wires -- many organizations use special
encrypting routers to ensure that their data cannot be read in transit. 
But
since NetShade encrypts your network data at the source and decrypts it at
its
destination, no special equipment is needed to secure the routed data.
<P>
In fact, since NetShade encrypts and decrypts your network data at the source
and
destination points respectively, this is in some ways a superior solution
to an
encrypting router.  If the encryption took place at the router level, and
D
wanted to send data to G, that data would still be vulnerable to eavesdropping
by
all the other users on both networks.  NetShade's point-to-point encryption
ensures that the data cannot be intercepted at any point in trasit, providing
substantially more security.  Now, G can connect with J, A, B and D
simultaneously, secure in the knowledge that no eavesdroppers will be able
to tap
into any of these links.
<P> 
In some cases, it may be desirable to apply greater security to cross-network
communication than to single-network data.  Since NetShade can easily be
upgraded
to support ultra-secure algorithms such as DES and Triple DES, when you send
information to a user on a separate network -- for example, when A makes
a
connection with J -- you could simply change your active mode to one of these
algorithms.  After the cross-network connection is broken, you can reset
your
active mode to NightShade if you like.
<P>
<H3>NetShade over Apple Remote Access (ARA)
</H3><P>Using NetShade over Apple Remote Access is also very similar to using
NetShade
over a LAN.  Figure 4 illustrates a typical NetShade-ARA configuration.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="24.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
In this scenario, remote user F logs into ARA server E over a dial-up modem
connection.  The ARA connection allows F to communicate with any machine
on the
network, including E.  Assuming that F shares at least one allowed communication
mode (see <A href="#multi">Using Multiple Encryption Modes</A> section) with
A,
B, D and E, all the data sent between F and those machines will be encrypted.
Since C is not running NetShade, data sent between F and C will not be encrypted.
 By the same token, even if E (the ARA server) was not running NetShade,
data
sent between F and A would still be encrypted.
<P>
<H3>Complex NetShade Network Configurations
</H3><P>One of the most appealing aspects of NetShade is that it can secure
network
traffic over complex networks, including those with multiple zones and internets,
without requiring any knowledge of how the network is set up.  As long as
your
NetShade machine can send AppleTalk data to any other NetShade machine --
regardless of how that data gets there -- you can establish a sealed session
between those two machines.
