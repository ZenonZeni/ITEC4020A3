am a mental patient. I put myself down faster than anyone else 
would.&quot; </p>
<p>c. &quot;Being a person with schizophrenia means that when you are 
released [from the hospital], you will have to face those you know 
with the shame and stigma of having needed to be institutionalized.&quot; </p>
<p>d. &quot;We will overcome the stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and 
rejection. Although it takes time, we can overcome our illness and 
the myths surrounding it.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>1 - slang words (i.e. &quot;nuts&quot;, &quot;wacko&quot;, &quot;psycho&quot;, &quot;lunatic&quot;) are dehumanizing 
affronts to people suffering from mental illness </p>
<p>2 - clinical or legal terms (i.e. &quot;schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;manic depression&quot;, 
&quot;psychosis&quot;, &quot;insane&quot;) should be checked carefully for accuracy before using </p>

who require medical help from psychiatric hospitals </p>
<p>4 - &quot;psychosis&quot; refers to an inability to distinguish real from unreal experience &amp; 
generally responds to antipsychotic medication </p>
<p>5 - &quot;psychopathy&quot; is an antisocial personality disorder in which there exists a 
pattern of irresponsible &amp; often unlawful behavior &amp; does not generally respond 
to antipsychotic medication </p>
<p>6 - it is offensive to depersonalize people who have a biologically-based 
disorder/say &quot;he has symptoms of schizophrenia&quot; rather than &quot;he's a 
schizophrenic&quot; </p>
<p>7 - when referring to mental illness, use standards of accuracy &amp; good taste that 
apply to any serious illness</p>
