<h2>8. The evidence of things not seen</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baudelaire complained in his time that ignorant
persons thought of the hashish dream as a kind of magic theater
where all sorts of miraculous things occur: wonders and marvels,
all unexpected. But in fact, said the poet, hashish has no
miracles to offer; all it does is exaggerate the natural, raising
the same number to a higher power, and the hashish dream
therefore will always be &quot;the son of its father,&quot;
reflecting the thoughts and impressions of the dreamer. Hashish
is a mirror&#151;&quot;a magnifying mirror, it is true, but only
a mirror&quot;&#151;and a man will see revealed in it
&quot;nothing except himself.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Evans-Wentz suggested that a wanderer on the Bardo
plane would see the gods of his own pantheon: a Christian would
see the Christian Heaven, a Moslem would see the Moslem Paradise,
an American Indian would see the Happy Hunting Ground, and a
materialist would experience after-death visions &quot;as
negative and as empty and as deityless as any he ever dreamt
while in the human body.&quot; The Tibetans taught, said
Evans-Wentz, that the after-death state is indeed very much like
the ordinary dream state, and whatever visions a man might see on
the Bardo are &quot;due entirely to his own mental-content.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no question that a subject under
psychedelic influence is extremely vulnerable to suggestion,
including autosuggestion, and this might support the contention
that the drug movement's Eastern orientation has been imposed
upon it by an Eastern drug literature. One might also consider
the fact that the drug experience historically has had Oriental
connotations, for what could be a very prosaic reason. The
hashish and opium of the nineteenth century came from the Orient,
and the Eastern imagery which so haunted the European drug fiend
might easily be explained as mental association. Even today the
mere word &quot;drug&quot; may often serve to summon up visions
of Fu Manchu and other sinister-looking Celestials. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The power-of-suggestion argument should not and
cannot be lightly dismissed. What can be dismissed, however, is
the contention that the psychedelic mystique is
&quot;quasi-Eastern&quot; or &quot;nebulous.&quot; Of course it
is nebulous, as we suggested earlier, but that is neither here
nor there; it is no more nebulous than any other metaphysical
assertion which cannot be submitted to empirical demonstration.
And it is not quasi-Eastern. It is Eastern. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the problem was only one of imagery,
suggestibility would no doubt be sufficient to account for it.
There is no objective reason why LSD should evoke an image of a
Chinese pagoda rather than a Western church, or Ishwara rather
than Jehovah. As Evans-Wentz indicated, even the Eastern
literature acknowledges the subjective factor as far as visual
content is concerned&#151;and it can afford to do so precisely
because it regards the Bardo visions as delusional: the
phenomenal gods and paradises and hells do not really exist
except in the mind of the dreamer, and that is just the point the
Eastern philosopher is trying to make. It is only the Clear Light
which matters and is real. Similarly, no particular importance is
attached to the hallucinatory period in psychedelic sessions; all
that matters is the central experience, which corresponds with
the apprehension of the Clear Light. Nor is the terminology used
of any significance. You can refer to the central experience as
the Clear Light, or as God, or as anything you wish. The question
which remains, then, is whether or not the central experience can
be imposed by suggestion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for Baudelaire's statement, a drug cultist could
easily turn it around to suit his own purposes. The psychedelics
do indeed offer us a mirror, and a very accurate one at that.
When a man looks into it, he sees nothing except himself&#151;and
this is just as it should be. That is the whole idea, right
there. There is nothing else to be revealed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We should keep in mind that the Eastern movement
did not grow out of the drug movement; if anything, it was the
other way around. The Eastern movement was well established when
Dr. Hofmann made his serendipitous discovery, and the factors
behind that leap to the East had little or nothing to do with
suggestion. The Eastern movement absorbed the drug movement, and
it did so because the central experience seemed to lend itself
very well to an Eastern interpretation. But why weren't the
Eastern implications obvious to begin with? Why did they have to
be interpreted? Why didn't psychedelic subjects know they were
having Eastern experiences? Why did they <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; have to be told? A possible answer, of course, is
that they did know&#151;but did not know that they knew. They
knew they were having some sort of an experience, but how were
they to know it was an Eastern experience unless they had some
knowledge of Eastern philosophy? If they did have the proper
background, they might have recognized their experience as
Eastern in nature&#151;and certainly somebody must have done this
at some point, or how else was the connection made in the first
place? Huxley had a mescaline experience, and he decided it was
Eastern; nobody had to tell him so: he told other people. But
Huxley of course was Eastern-oriented; maybe it was
autosuggestion. And so the circle turns vicious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us turn, then, to the people Huxley told,
assuming they were not Eastern-oriented themselves, and let us
ask why they believed him. They had an experience perhaps, and
they did not know what to make of it; there was nothing they knew
with which to compare it; they did not have the vocabulary to
verbalize their intuitions or even to think them through; the
concepts involved were new and startling, completely bewildering.
Then Huxley and other Eastern enthusiasts provided a vocabulary
and suggested various alternatives and possible conclusions which
might be drawn from the experience. Somehow it seemed to fit, and
people said, &quot;Yes. That's it. That's exactly what it
was.&quot; An analogy might be a robbery victim who flips through
the photographs in a police rogues' gallery and then declares,
&quot;There, that's the man.&quot; Such victims unfortunately
have been notoriously poor witnesses, and even their certainty
leaves a reasonable doubt that a reliable identification has been
made. Still, could a full-scale movement be generated by
suggestion alone, with nothing substantial to support the
suggestion? Surely there is something in the drug experience
which makes the Eastern interpretation at least appear tenable.
Furthermore, supporting evidence is provided by related
developments in radical theology, where a leap to the East also
is occurring, and without benefit of LSD. Watts and Huxley cannot
be blamed for that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor can they be blamed for the results of those
turn-of-the-century experiments with nitrous oxide.
Significantly, James found that the anesthetic (psychedelic)
revelation tended to suggest &quot;a monistic insight, in which
the <i>other</i> in its various forms appears absorbed into the
One.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even so, from either point of view, we still are
left with a Scotch verdict: not proven. And there the matter
might rest, were it not for a final factor which has to do with
mysticism as such. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact is that Western church authorities have
generally regarded spontaneous mysticism with a measure of
distrust and sometimes with open hostility. There is first of all
the obvious objection that the mystic in a sense eliminates the
middleman: he deals directly with God and thereby undermines the
church's assumed right to act as religious arbiter. The second
objection is less obvious but more important. It seems mysticism
has shown a distressing tendency toward pantheism and monism, and
the saintly mystic has often been a source of acute embarrassment
to his church. We are talking now about Western mysticism. We are
saying that Western mysticism has tended to be very much like
Eastern mysticism; or, more accurately, all mysticism, Eastern
and Western, has tended to be the same. James noted as a general
trait of the mystic range of consciousness that it &quot;is on
the whole pantheistic and optimistic.&quot; He said further: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This overcoming of all the usual barriers between the
    individual and the Absolute is the great mystic achievement.
    In mystic states we become one with the Absolute and we
    become aware of our oneness. This is the everlasting and
    triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences
    of clime and creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism,
    in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same
    recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an
    eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think
    . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Churchmen had stopped to think about it long before
James made the suggestion, and they did not like what they were
thinking. Mysticism too often had quite a lot to say about God's
immanence and not very much to say about his transcendence; it
had a lot to say about the divine encounter, but in many cases
that seemed to imply a monistic absorption, not union through
love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, the concern of the church has been
in three areas: (1) the institutional, (2) the rational, and (3)
the mystical. In the first, the church has sought to create a
community of faithful with a heritage of common belief; in the
second, it has sought to adduce logical proofs for the existence
of God; in the third, it has sought to put church members in
direct contact with the source of their faith. And every age has
given these elements different emphasis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Roman Catholicism has had its great mystic
saints&#151;Saint Theresa, Saint John of the Cross&#151;but it
also has had such thorns in the side as Master Eckhart, a
Dominican, whose mystical utterances in fourteenth-century
Germany sounded very much like pantheism. The rational Saint
Thomas largely ignored mysticism, and Roman Catholicism took the
position that God's existence could be proved intellectually. A
severe reaction against mysticism occurred in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, led by the Jesuits and provoked in part by
the excesses of the Quietists (Molinos, Madame Guyon, Fenelon).
Quietism was accused of perverting the contemplative aspect of
mystical experience; it recommended total annihilation of the
mind, of the self, of all desire, including even the desire for
salvation; it blurred or erased altogether the distinction
between evil and good, man and God; wholly passive, it eschewed
all thoughts and acts of service or devotion; it sought divine
inspiration in the &quot;soft and savory sleep of
nothingness&quot;; in its extreme form it produced a state of
&quot;mystic death&quot; which bordered on catatonia. The
practical and beloved Saint Theresa, reformer of the Carmelite
Order, had combined the active and the contemplative life, as
indeed had Jesus before her. By comparison, the Quietists
appeared apathetic and amoral, if not immoral; they were charged
with &quot;idle basking in the divine presence,&quot; and their
doctrines were condemned by Popes Innocent XI and Innocent XII.
Mysticism in all its manifestations came under suspicion, and
Catholics were advised that the mystical experience was a gift
from God, not to be sought after. While this attitude was later
softened, the Catholic reaction to Quietism quite likely has yet
to run its course; nor can there be much doubt that the Vatican
would tend to make a mental equation between the demand for a
direct person-to-God relationship and the sort of thinking that
resulted in the Reformation. Antagonism toward a mystical
emphasis also was evident in Rome's dispute with the Catholic
Modernists during the early years of the twentieth century. The
Modernists could scarcely be accused of Quietism&#151;they were
in fact activists who believed in living their faith, and they
strove for a liberal synthesis of the new science and orthodox
belief. But they also were at odds with their church's stress on
the rational knowledge of God, and especially so with the revival
of the Scholastic tradition which was implicit in the emergence
of Neo-Thomism. Rejecting religious intellectualism, they called
instead for a religion of the inner way: of the heart, not the
mind. Pope Pius X described their synthesis as a &quot;synthesis
of all heresies.&quot; Their doctrines were condemned in 1907,
and the Modernist movement was crushed by excommunication. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have already mentioned the mysticism of the
Jewish Cabala, and in the following chapter we shall discuss at
some length the flowering of Hasidism in the philosophical
thought of Martin Buber. Turning to Protestantism, we find, as
might be expected, that the mystic at first met with a friendly
reception: the desire for a personal intimacy with God was one of
the root causes of the Christian schism. Luther himself was a
mystic. But even within Protestantism, restrictions were placed
upon the complete freedom of intuitive experience&#151;which led
in turn to such developments as creedless Quakerism and the
Quaker-meeting concept of personal communion with the indwelling
Christ: the Inner Light. In the present century, Protestant
mysticism came under fire from the heavy guns of Karl Barth and
Emil Brunner. The barrage was devastating (or seemed to be), and,
outside the revivalist's tent, spontaneous inner experience gave
way to a general emphasis upon creeds and community of worship.
Maybe it was not so much Barth as it was the overall decline in
religious conviction&#151;and therefore also in religious awe.
Maybe it was just an end-product of secularization. But in any
case it occurred. Or such at least was the opinion of Carl Jung
and others who warned that the churches to their peril were
ignoring their fundamental mission and their basic source of
strength. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the church critics saw it, that fundamental
mission was to put men in personal touch with their God&#151;to
encourage, in other words, the divine-human encounter. And that
basic source of strength was the mystical perception of the
nonrational mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Such an argument makes mystical perception the
primary source of religious faith.</i> To follow the argument,
however, it is necessary first to define faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A skeptic has defined faith as believing in
something you know is not true. And many devout persons might
actually agree with that. As Kierkegaard expressed the same idea,
faith would not be faith if there were any rational basis for it.
Faith and reason are mutually exclusive, the one beginning where
the other ends, and a faith based on reason would be a
contradiction in terms; it would in fact be reason, not faith:
just one more example of ratiocination and logical analysis.
Absolute faith recognizes the utter impossibility of its claim;
to make the movement of absolute faith, you must first make the
movement of absolute resignation&#151;and then you believe
anyway, &quot;by virtue of the absurd.&quot; And this is faith.
The knight of faith knows that &quot;the only thing that can save
him is the absurd, and this he grasps by faith.&quot; He
acknowledges the impossibility, &quot;and that very instant he
believes the absurd; for, if without recognizing the
impossibility with all the passion of his soul and with all his
heart, he should wish to imagine that he has faith, he deceives
himself.&quot; Paul Tillich expressed a similar view, insisting
that absolute faith must be preceded by absolute doubt and
despair. You confess that existence is meaningless, and then you
accept your existence <i>in spite of</i> this&#151;and this
&quot;courage to be&quot; in the face of meaninglessness is in
itself meaningful. Where does it come from, if not from Being
itself? What does it represent, if not the power and the purpose
of the godhead? &quot;The act of accepting meaninglessness is in
itself a meaningful act. It is an act of faith.&quot; And so on.
But it is possible to define faith in an entirely different way
as well, and perhaps an inkling of this can be found in Hebrews: <i>&quot;Now
faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; John in his Epistle does not say that faith is
based on the absurd; he says it is based on <i>evidence</i>.
Science is based on the evidence of things seen. Faith is based
on the evidence of things not seen. Both, then, are forms of
deduction, and they differ only in the methods which they employ
to gather their evidence: science relies upon the rational mind
or the conscious; faith relies upon the intuitive mind or the
unconscious. This is precisely what Jung was talking about: he
said the churches were ignoring the vital role of the
unconscious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The churches perhaps were having enough trouble
with science and so were in no mood to encourage a free-wheeling
mysticism which might lead to a further erosion of orthodox
dogma. But Jung and other critics believed that religion was
making its stand on the weakest ground available. The logical
proofs for God's existence were not very convincing. Even if they
were, the intellect would reject them if instinct said no. Nor
did it do any good to urge more faith, because faith is not an
effort of will but, rather, a conviction based upon the evidence
of things not seen. And the ultimate and only source of this
evidence is the unconscious. &quot;The unconscious,&quot; said
Zen scholar Suzuki, &quot;is the matrix of all metaphysical
assertions, of all mythology, of all philosophy.&quot; Years
before, James had suggested that the unconscious was man's
liaison to that unseen or mystical world for which the word God
is &quot;the natural appellation.&quot; He proposed that the
unconscious sends us whispers of that other world &quot;even as
the waters of the infinite ocean send their waves to break among
the pebbles that lie upon our shores.&quot; He said that all of
man's ideal impulses appear to originate in that other world; if
there <i>are</i> spiritual agencies out there, he argued, it
seems only logical that they should communicate with us through
&quot;the subconscious continuation of our conscious life.&quot;
&quot;If there be higher powers able to impress us,&quot; he
said, &quot;they may get access to us only through the subliminal
door.&quot; And Jung agreed. But he charged that the churches
were concerned only with creeds&#151;with &quot;traditional and
collective convictions which in the case of many of their
adherents are no longer based on their own inner
experience.&quot; Unreflecting belief, he said, &quot;is
notoriously apt to disappear as soon as one begins to think about
it,&quot; and in any case it is &quot;no adequate substitute for
inner experience.&quot; The unconscious is &quot;the only
accessible source of religious experience.&quot; This does not
mean the unconscious is God. It is, however, &quot;the medium
from which the religious experience seems to flow.&quot; It is
not the role of the church, said Jung, to rope men into a social
organization and reduce them to a condition of diminished
responsibility. The care of the church should be the individual
soul; the task of the church is &quot;helping the individual to
achieve a metanoia, or rebirth of the spirit.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From this point of view, the unconscious perhaps is
comparable to a shortwave radio receiver. And the church has only
one function: it should help men tune in on God's wavelength, so
to speak, and after that it should drop out of the picture
altogether, making no effort to interpret the transmissions&#151;
much less to jam them. The challenge to church authority becomes
increasingly obvious, and indeed it has always been implicit not
only in outright mysticism but in any form of devotion which
emphasizes inner experience. The challenge was there long before
the word &quot;unconscious&quot; was introduced to the
vocabulary&#151;the Tibetans meant the unconscious when they
spoke of the Knower&#151;and the German theologian Friedrich
Schleiermacher as far back as 1799 was calling for a religion
based exclusively on <i>Ansokauung und Gefühl</i>, or intuition
and emotion. A rejection of all creeds and dogma also was
fundamental to the &quot;spiritual Christianity&quot; proposed
four decades ago by the Russian philosopher Nicolas Berdyaev, and
many other examples could be given. Huxley saw the urge for
self-transcendence as &quot;a principal appetite of the
soul,&quot; and that appetite in our time has not been satisfied
in church; today, &quot;the sole religious experience is that
state of uninhibited and belligerent euphoria which follows the
ingestion of the third cocktail.&quot; Tillich pointed to the
decline of religious awe: the question of our century perhaps was
whether or not man could regain that sense of wonder he had once
known in personal communion with the Ground of his Being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then came LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With it has come a rebirth of awe. While some
people might debate the assertion that this is religious awe,
many members of the drug movement regard it as such&#151;and the
drug movement, as mentioned, has already produced a number of
psychedelic churches, of which the Church of the Awakening may
serve as an example. The church was incorporated in 1963 under
the laws of New Mexico by John and Louisa Aiken, retired
osteopaths. In a statement of purpose the church defines religion
in its internal aspect as &quot;the search within one's own
consciousness for the Self, which is Being, which is Life.&quot;
And to help the search along the church administers &quot;the
psychedelic sacrament.&quot; In a 1964 decision based on the
First Amendment, the California Supreme Court ruled that Indian
members of the Native American Church could not legally be
deprived of the peyote used in their religious ceremonies. As a
consequence of the widespread legislation against LSD, the Church
of the Awakening and similar organizations such as the
Neo-American Church and Timothy Leary's League for Spiritual
Discovery have indicated they might seek a First Amendment court
test to determine whether freedom of psychedelic religion applies
also to the paleface, and the law's ultimate decision should
prove to be of considerable interest, to say the least. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drug cults make impressive claims. In the past,
they say, religion probably had real depth for only a minority of
churchgoers. Under the best of circumstances, a direct encounter
with God was reserved for the special few; and even for them the
experience was usually fleeting in nature. There are of course no
statistics available on mystic percentiles, but it is just
possible that psychologist Abraham H. Maslow offers us a rough
clue with his concept of the &quot;self-actualizing&quot; person
who is capable of achieving from time to time what Maslow has
described as a &quot;peak experience.&quot; We shall have much
more to say about Maslow's psychology in a later chapter; for the
moment, we are concerned only with his conclusion that
self-actualization is possible for less than 1 per cent of the
adult population. If peak experience and mystical experience are
similar, and if Maslow's figure is reasonably accurate, it is
rather interesting to find at the other end of the mental
spectrum that schizophrenia is also said to affect about 1 per
cent of the population. By comparison, the studies cited
previously suggest that psychedelics can provide a mystical
religious experience for up to 90 per cent of the population,
which is certainly a considerable improvement. Now, say the
cultists, with LSD it is possible for almost anybody to commune
with God, any time he wants to, and for hours at a stretch. Now
the common man can share the mystical visions of the saints
themselves, and it is no longer necessary to spend ten or twenty
years in a Zen monastery to achieve true <i>satori</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drug movement says to the churches: &quot;Here,
at last, <i>this</i> is what we were looking for, and never
finding. This is what people really want. What do you have to
offer in its place?&quot; And so orthodoxy and the psychedelic
experience arrive at their collision point. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The institutional challenge is serious, if you
accept the premise that psychedelic experience is actually
mystical experience. Obviously the churches cannot compete with
the drugs in promoting that experience, even if they wished to.
It remains to be asked whether the experience should be
promoted&#151; whether in fact it threatens a jet-age
Quietism&#151;and there are arguments on both sides, to be
discussed later. But what about the doctrinal challenge? Is it
really true that the central drug experience confirms the Eastern
ideas we have mentioned? And why do these ideas have so much
appeal for Westerners in this day and age? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To begin with, psychedelic experience is closer to
Zen than it is to anything else the East has to offer. And Zen is
a unique religion, even in the East. It appears to be monistic
and pantheistic, but actually it is not. Unlike Hinduism, it does
not indulge in elaborate metaphysics; as far as possible it
avoids words altogether, and the student is advised to let the
mildew grow on his lips. Basically anti-intellectual, Zen
stresses intuition and the direct personal experience of reality.
As Suzuki put it, Zen seeks only to grasp &quot;the central fact
of life,&quot; which is found only in the here and now. It is
aimed at those &quot;who die of hunger while sitting beside the
rice bag.&quot; Unlike other schools of Buddhism, it does not
regard the world as illusory, an epiphenomenon of the mind; like
Saint Thomas, it rejects any dichotomy between body and spirit
(as it rejects all other dualistic concepts): in essence it is a
yes-saying to life and to the world. Suzuki was at pains to
refute the idea that Zen is pantheistic. Zen neither confirms nor
denies a transcendent God&#151;another dualism&#151;and if Zen
seems strangely silent about God, that is only because all
statements are limiting. If asked what God is, however, a Zen
master might say, &quot;Three pounds of flax.&quot; And this
sounds pantheistic. If a Hindu said it, it would be pantheistic.
But the Zen master's statement has nothing to do with such ideas;
in calling attention to something quite prosaic, the Zen master
is simply affirming the holiness of the commonplace in the moment
being lived. He might just as easily have eaten a peach, gone for
a walk&#151;or slapped his pupil in the face again. Since <i>satori</i>
can hardly be distinguished from the psychedelic experience, it
is significant that Zen scholarship has not found in this insight
any necessary implication of pantheism or monism; since Zen
scholarship represents centuries of study devoted to the very
subject which concerns them, immanence-minded drug cultists might
find cause to re-examine their experience in the light of Zen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still, the sense of immanence under psychedelic
influence is very pronounced. It is overwhelming. And after all,
as we have already said, it is not necessary for an orthodox
Westerner to reject the concept altogether: it is possible to
conceive of God as both transcendent <i>and</i> immanent. To
borrow an example which has been used before, Shakespeare is
immanent in the characters of <i>The Tempest</i>. In him they
live and move and have their Being. But Shakespeare also
transcends his characters, in the sense that they do not exhaust
his Being; the characters are Shakespeare, but Shakespeare is
something more than Prospero and Trinculo. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same sense, the indwelling God acts from
within, &quot;through the path of immanence.&quot; He still
transcends the world. But the world might fail to recognize this.
The very fact of immanence could well blind men to God's
transcendent character: in the psychedelic state especially, the
part could easily mistake itself for the whole. As Baudelaire saw
it, the hashish eater imagines himself to be God&#151;and never
thinks to ask himself the haunting question, &quot;Might there
not be another God?&quot; Or to put it another way, &quot;Might
there not be <i>more</i> God?&quot; Thus the psychedelic
experience neither absolutely confirms nor absolutely denies
God's transcendence. If it confirms anything, it confirms his
immanence. And there is nothing in the experience which
necessarily rules out an immanent God who is also transcendent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as different ages have emphasized either the
mystical or the rational aspect of religion, so too have
immanence and transcendence been in and out of fashion. Saint
Thomas, as might be expected, had attempted in his time to avoid
either one extreme or the other, offering instead a synthesis of
immanence and transcendence. Calvinism, on the other hand,
insisted upon a majestic and omnipotent God who utterly
transcended the pitiful race of man, and transcendence also was
central to the Deism of Voltaire and others for whom God was the
Great Watchmaker: having created the world and its laws, he had
gone off to exist in complete isolation from his creation. The
mystics for their part preached the immanence of God; throughout
history, in fact, whenever orthodoxy has made God too remote and
austere, the mystic prophets have appeared from the wilderness to
reassert his immanence, and respect for immanence has gone hand
in hand with an emphasis upon inner experience in religious
devotion. Immanentist concepts were given powerful expression in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, both in literature and
philosophy. But the first part of the twentieth century saw the
emergence of a kind of neo-Calvinism, and Karl Barth again was in
large part responsible for the development: his objection to
mysticism necessarily included a concomitant objection to
mysticism's accent on immanence, and the result was a renewed
appreciation of divine transcendence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is possible, however, that the neglect of
immanence has been at least partly to blame for the decline of
religious enthusiasm in this era of technology and
secularization. A wholly transcendent God is probably least
compatible with modern science and modern experience&#151;he is
the kind of God modern man finds hardest to accept&#151;and it
does the churches no good to argue that this kind of God is a
caricature. It does no good to insist that the churches have not
preached this kind of God, and it does no good to argue that
theology perhaps has proposed an entirely different kind of God.
Doubtless we give theology and philosophy much more credit than
they deserve. A great philosopher decides something, and we
imagine that he has decided for his entire generation, if not for
the century in which he lived; this school of opinion gives way
to that school of opinion, and we suppose that mankind has been
following the contest like a football match, with critical
interest, and that everybody knows whether this side or that side
has the ball at the moment. If the players would look around,
however, they would find that the crowd is not paying much
attention to the game, or does not understand it, or finds it
hard to keep an eye on the ball. Of course the wholly
transcendent God is a caricature&#151;but a caricature by
definition is a distortion or exaggeration of an actual
characteristic, and an emphasis on transcendence has been a
characteristic of Western theology. Indeed, this characteristic
has mainly served to distinguish Western from Eastern religion,
and it should hardly surprise us to find that a desire to
preserve that distinction has led to an undue emphasis upon it in
the public mind. &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; Ask the
common man that question, and he will assume you are referring to
a transcendent figure of some sort. Ask the uncommon man the same
question; he still will assume that you are referring to
something along those lines. Of course he knows better, but he
takes it for granted that you do not, when you ask the question.
He may say, &quot;Well, that depends what you mean by God.&quot;
The question itself has come to imply that caricature of
caricatures, the bearded monarch on the marble throne&#151;and
that image is inferred even in those cases when it is not
actually implied. Especially is it inferred when the word God is
spoken from the pulpit of a church. The idea is ridiculous, of
course, and that is precisely the reason modern man no longer
believes in it. Unfortunately, he still thinks he is being asked
to believe in it, and that is the root of the problem. Eastern
philosophy, on the other hand, does not ask him to believe in it,
nor does the psychedelic experience ask him to believe in it, and
the credit both give to immanence is without question responsible
for much of the current interest in Eastern ideas and in LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The churches had been complacent. Perhaps they
imagined that the caricature no longer existed, and so they made
no effort to correct it or to offer their parishioners a more
plausible alternative. But the caricature did exist, although few
people believed in it&#151;or in anything else for that matter,
as a direct consequence. The continued existence of the
caricature resulted inevitably in a reaction against it, and
necessarily in a drastic reaction. The idea was so deeply
embedded in popular theology, and churchmen were so ignorant of
this fact, that Altizer had to kill off the transcendent God
altogether before the churchmen displayed any visible signs of
alarm. Then LSD came along. If they now hope to preserve any
vestige of transcendence, the churches might be well advised to
take a fresh look at the weight of their teaching&#151;and start
talking immanence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the decline of Barthianism, this has already
happened in radical theology. Basic to contemporary developments
in this area have been the concept of immanence and the direct
inner experience of that immanence. In Protestantism the reaction
against stark transcendence can be traced progressively from
Tillich to the New Theologians to the Death of God theologians.
In Judaism the voice of Martin Buber has been heard. In Roman
Catholicism immanence is the very heart of Teilhard de Chardin's
theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But immanence has always been a dangerous idea, as
we have indicated. Open the door to immanence and pantheism tries
to slip in with it. This too has been happening. </p>
