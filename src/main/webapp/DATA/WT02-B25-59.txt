<p>1 - competent criminal lawyers are 
almost always available </p>

services, court- appointed 
attorneys, local criminal defense 
lawyers' associations, or local bar 
associations </p>

Constitution guarantees legal 
representation to every defendant 
in a felony criminal case, the state 
must provide a lawyer to anyone 
charged with a felony who cannot 
afford a lawyer </p>
