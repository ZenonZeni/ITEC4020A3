THE EVOLVING ONLINE DATABASE INDUSTRY

Over 25 years ago the commercial online database industry was born through
products such as Lockheed's Dialog and SDC's Orbit  with  their federally-
funded counterparts  such  as  NASA/Recon,  DOE/Recon  and Medlars.  These
services were begun when the "mainframe was king"  and  users accessed the
systems through "dumb terminals"  over private telecommunications networks
managed  by  these companies or   telecommunications  partners. Since that
time  there  have  been  major  changes  in  the  business,  computer  and
networking industries which have caused evolutionary changes in the online
field in  terms of  technology,  networking,  changing  economics  and new
advancements.  Probably  the two  most  significant  impacts  in  the last
quarter century are the emergence of  the international  Internet  and the
tremendous price/performance  advancements  in  computer  technology which
bring connectivity and very powerful computer technology  into every level
of the workplace and home.

The 'Gale Directory of  Databases',  long considered a "Bible" of database
selection  and mirror  of  the online  industry,  has listed around 10,000
databases from  3,500  database  producers  and  vended  through  over 800
online service providers.  Yet, with the emergence of the Internet and low
cost computing,  this measure is losing much meaning.   Literally hundreds
of  thousands of  database and  information services are  now available on
the Internet  from  the largest firms to  individuals at  home  using well
documented and easily  accessible  technology  such as the World  Wide Web
through which information can be organized and presented.  Everyone admits
that this  proliferation of  online  services  and tools is  confusing and
there are many poor services on the net,  and yet,  this trend is changing
the  way in  which traditional online  service providers must  address the
market.  Information producers no longer  necessarily need to go  to major
online vendors for providing wide scale access to  their information [yes,
there are still many advantages in doing so] and yet many are  now putting
their own online services directly on the Internet.

The Evolution of Computers and Networking

   *  Low cost access  to the  Internet through myriads  of local Internet
   service providers has meant that  the largest companies  to  home users
   can contract for connectivity at prices which are scalable to needs.

   *  Networking technology can now be purchased in bandwidth chunks which
   are scalable  to  local needs.   For  example,  high speed modems (e.g.
   28.8  Kbps)  which work over regular phone lines are under $200, easier
   access to ISDN [64 Kbps] is available in the home and office,  lowering
   costs of leased lines for higher speeds can even  provide T1  speeds at
   prices affordable by small businesses.

   *  Newer networking technology such as frame relay, ATM and plans being
   offered by  cable and phone companies for  optical  fiber  or  TV cable
   access to  the Internet  bring the hope  of  even  higher  bandwidth at
   affordable prices.

   *  Computing power in terms of instructions per  second has experienced
   huge growth ... Many PCs and Unix  boxes now have  more computing power
   than  supercomputers  of a  decade ago.   Intel's Pentium Pro processor
   currently  is  clocked at  200  MHz  and indications are that  the fast
   evolution  in processors will  continue.   DEC currently produces a 266
   MHz Alpha RISC Chip, Sun Microsystems now has RISC UltraSPARC chips  at
   just under 200  MHz,  and  the PowerPC RISC  chips being produced  as a
   cooperative venture with Motorola and IBM are in the same  speed range.
   Truly phenomenal computing speed is widely available.

   *   Hard   disk   storage   technology   has   experienced   the   same
   price/performance  improvements  as  the  microprocessor.   It  is  now
   difficult to buy disks with less than  1  gigabyte of storage at prices
   of just a few hundred dollars.  Many suppliers are commonly offering  1
   GB to 9 GB drives at very low costs per byte.

   * CD-ROM technology has found its niche in the home market for easy and
   cheap distribution  of  games,  databases and application  programs.  A
   quad-speed or faster CD-ROM is  now considered a  standard feature with
   most PCs.

   * Full multimedia on PCs and over the Internet are now commonplace.

   * The  operating systems which seem to be dominating the marketplace at
   this time are Windows 95  for individual  users,  Windows NT for larger
   multiuser database access and Unix.   There has been a dramatic decline
   in the use of traditional mainframe operating systems.

   *  About 80%  of the local area  network (LAN)  market is  now  held by
   Novell.  However,  it  is unclear whether  this will begin to  erode as
   multiuser operating systems such as Windows NT may make traditional LAN
   technology obsolete.   Clearly, Novell and other LAN developers need to
   offer a rich body of features and make their products  easier-to-use to
   keep ahead of the Microsoft juggernaut.

Evolution of System Features

   *  Many companies which began as producers of databases of CD-ROMs have
   now  broadened  their  market  to  offering  their  search  engines and
   databases for local loading under Unix or Windows NT.  Examples of this
   include  SilverPlatter with  their ERL service which  allows  the local
   loading  of  databases for multiuser access  under SCO Unix  or Solaris
   (Sun's version of Unix)  and they are beta testing a Windows NT version
   of  ERL.  Ovid Technologies (formerly called  CDPlus Technologies which
   shows their CD-ROM  origins)  is now primarily  distributing its search
   engines and databases for local Unix  servers.   Ovid  uses  CD-ROMs to
   distribute database  updates which local sites  copy  to  hard  disk to
   provide widescale multiuser access.

   *  Many companies which originally were not database vendors have moved
   into this marketplace because it nicely complements other products they
   vend.  For example, many developers of integrated library systems (CARL
   Corporation,  Ameritech's  VISTA  System,  Innovative  Interfaces  Inc.
   INN-VIEW system,  DRA operates the Open DRA Net service and others) now
   centrally mount suites of databases.   Although users of these services
   are typically  libraries  which  use  a  particular  integrated library
   system,  most of  these  vendors  are  trying  to  make  broader market
   penetration. Traditional cataloging utilities such as OCLC, RLG and WLN
   have all moved into the database vending market.  Their success in this
   is due to  a large existing  customer  base,  and  synergism with other
   products  they  offer (e.g.  link to  holdings, ILL/document delivery).
   Many publishers and database producers are beginning to offer their own
   online services.  Examples include Information Access Company (IAC) who
   has its own online system while still licensing its databases  to other
   vendors or  individual  sites;  EBSCO has  launched  its  own EBSCOhost
   system for offering its databases and those of  others,  Academic Press
   is  offering  its entire  family  of  print journals  on  the  Web, and
   Elsevier is offering  its huge  journal product in  electronic form for
   local loading.

   *  Online service providers are augmenting their traditional ASCII text
   search  interfaces  with  graphical user interfaces (gui).   Two trends
   seem  to  be  predominant -  many vendors are offering  proprietary gui
   clients for use with their specific online  system which  are rich with
   features;  many online services are now offering  web server  access to
   their database servers so that a person can use a standard  web browser
   (e.g.  Netscape,  Mosaic, Lynx) to search databases.  Web server access
   to database servers is advantageous because one does not  need to worry
   about client software distribution and the problems of  illegal copying
   of proprietary software.

   * Z39.50 client/server compliance is now supported by many major online
   services such  as CARL Corporation,  DRA,  Ameritech VISTA, EBSCO, OCLC
   FirstSearch, IAC, Innovative Interfaces, Ovid Technologies, RLG Citadel
   and SilverPlatter.   Thus users can select  the Z39.50  client of their
   choice and have a common  interface to many different  online services.
   Clearly this standard is still  rapidly evolving and  Z39.50 clients do
   not offer the rich  range of  features  as proprietary  clients and yet
   most feel that  the Z39.50  protocol holds great promise.   A number of
   Z39.50  clients now offer the ability  to  launch  searches  to several
   servers at the same time (e.g. DRA, Search Access).

   *  A  "link to  holdings"  feature  is  now  offered  by  some vendors.
   Although this can be handled in different  ways,  the main idea is that
   when a user  looks at  a bibliographic citation  (if full  text  is not
   online) the system indicates if a local library owns the citation. OCLC
   and RLG can perform this at the "title level"  for sites who catalog on
   their   systems.    Local  ILS  vendors   (e.g.  Ameritech,  Innovative
   Interfaces,  DRA)  can often link  to a serial summary  holdings record
   assuming the library uses the vendor in question.   Some products allow
   a library to create electronic lists of holdings statements  (e.g. IAC)
   so that when a citation is retrieved holdings show, and EBSCO indicates
   title  level ownership  information  on  its  EBSCOhost  service  if an
   organization uses  the EBSCO subscription  services  for  serials. Ovid
   Technologies does a Z39.50 call to a local Z39.50 compliant ILS so that
   the holdings information is  then  returned and displayed  to the user.
   The  link  is  up-to-date  and  does  not  require   the  creation  and
   maintenance of a second holdings file.

   *  Full scanned images are being commonly delivered by products such as
   UMI PowerPages, IAC, EBSCO and others. Full-text ASCII delivery is also
   common through vendors such as IAC, EBSCO, LEXIS-NEXIS and others.

   *  When full-text is not available online  (in either  ASCII or scanned
   images)  most online systems now offer the ability to launch a document
   delivery or ILL request.

   *  Multilingual support is  now being offered  more  frequently through
   PC-based  clients.   This  is  especially  important  with  the diverse
   American  culture  and  the  greater  internationalization   of  online
   services because of the Internet.

   *  Natural  language search interfaces  are appearing on  many consumer
   products such as "Homework Helper"  by Infonautics,  Cognito by IAC and
   EyeQ by DataTimes.

   *  Greater  sophistication  in  mapping natural language  to controlled
   vocabulary  is  appearing (e.g.  Ovid has extensive  abilities  in this
   area)  and  the ability for users to  interact  authority  or thesaural
   files is commonplace.

Changing Economics

Probably the biggest  financial trend in  the online industry in  the last
five years has been  a growing use of  "flat fee"  pricing  algorithms for
libraries and other institutions.   This originally began in the mid-1980s
when  academic  and  public  libraries  began  to  shift  away  from using
commercial timesharing services  for high-use databases  and replaced them
with CD-ROMs which could be  licensed for  a flat annual fee.   This trend
continued to evolve into the local loading of  databases  in institutional
database servers and has now gone full circle to  libraries demanding flat
fee pricing from online service providers.   This flat fee pricing through
online service providers has been challenging since one must get agreement
from  the  online  vendor  and  the  database  producer.   This  is  often
complicated by  factors such as libraries wanting to  subscribe  in groups
through consortia.   Online vendors and database producers  have developed
many unique pricing algorithms to maintain revenue while responding to the
need in many institutions for fixed fee pricing so  they  can manage tight
budgets.   The  most  common  algorithm  usually  involves  some  type  of
concurrent  user  model.   Most libraries,  however, still use many of the
commercial timesharing services for medium and low use databases where the
institution wants occasional access to many different files.

Many vendors are also developing personal pricing strategies in an attempt
to provide low cost access to database services over the  Internet for the
individual.   Typically,  these  involve billing or  credit  card payments
which an individual can afford  and the vendor  hopes to make a  profit in
volume.

Some  online  services  offer their  search  engine  for  free  if  a site
subscribes  to  or  locally   loads   some   of   their   databases  (e.g.
SilverPlatter, IAC,  most databases from ILS vendors) ... the library only
pays for the  database  subscription.   However,  there  are  some notable
exceptions   such  as  Ovid   Technologies   or   OCLC   SiteSearch  where
organizations are willing to pay a premium for specialized services.

Conclusion

With the emergence of the Internet and low-cost high-powered computing the
online industry is in a state of  flux.  Many traditional online providers
need to be flexible to respond to user needs.   Online services need to be
powerful  and yet easy-to-use,  must  be  client-centered,  and  must have
pricing options for many different market segments.  [GSM]

GALILEO: UNIV OF GEORGIA USING OCLC SITESEARCH AND WEBZ DATABASE PRODUCTS

The University System of Georgia is offering a suite  of bibliographic and
full-text  databases  to  34  state-supported  academic  libraries through
GALILEO,  the Georgia Library Learning Online System.  GALILEO offers over
50  databases using OCLC SiteSearch Z39.50  Server System coupled with the
OCLC WebZ software which lets  users access  the system  over the Internet
using standard web browsers.

This aggressive  project was spearheaded by William Gray Potter, director,
University of  Georgia.   "We wanted full Z39.50  compatibility with a Web
browser ... We know  we wanted  to  take  a client-server approach  but we
didn't want to be in the business of attempting to distribute and maintain
a proprietary client.  And  we  wanted  to provide  ready integration with
OCLC's FirstSearch  service.  With  SiteSearch  and  WebZ,  we're  able to
perform all these functions."

Two parallel SiteSearch systems are being run at the University of Georgia
and  Georgia  State  University  to  distribute  the   load  for   the  34
participating institutions.   Some of the databases are locally loaded and
some are offered on a pass-through basis to the FirstSearch system at OCLC
in Ohio.  Databases  offered  include  a suite  of   periodical  indexing/
abstracting services, an encyclopedia and full-text to over 1,100 journals
from EBSCO.

High-use files or files of local interest are put on the  local SiteSearch
servers while other databases are offered seamlessly  through FirstSearch.
In the future,  the  Galileo project  will  offer  scanned  document image
databases including the Georgia archives and state documents. In addition,
other libraries in the state will be brought into  the project to  build a
statewide network available to all residents of the state.

For more information on OCLC's SiteSearch and WebZ  products contact: OCLC
Online Computer Library Center,  6565  Frantz Road, Dublin, OH 43017-3395.
Telephone: (614) 764-6000. Fax: (614) 764-6096.

OCLC OFFERS PASSPORT SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

In 1990,  OCLC released  a DOS-based  telecommunications  software product
called Passport which was designed to be used with the OCLC online system.
In December  1995,  OCLC released  the first Windows  version  of Passport
which takes advantage of many of the standard Windows features.   Prior to
release OCLC did a three month field test with 18 libraries.

Some of the special advantages of Passport for Windows include the ability
for users to cut and paste information from OCLC to a local library system
window; training time is reduced and it is easier for occasional users; it
offers a  macro language which  allows catalogers to  create pop-up dialog
boxes which can be used  to easily modify  information in  a local system;
and  it  offers  the scripting of  authorizations  and  passwords  to OCLC
FirstSearch and other OCLC online services.

OCLC has indicated that  they  will  continue  to make the DOS  version of
Passport available to users.

STAR/WEB OFFERS WWW ACCESS TO THE CUADRA STAR SYSTEM

For  many  years Cuadra  Associates  Inc.  has produced  the  popular STAR
information retrieval system.  In December 1995, the company announced the
availability of  STAR/Web  which allows  any web  browser  to  access STAR
databases over  the Internet.  STAR/Web uses  a  common  gateway interface
(cgi)  program that connects STAR  software to any standard  or commercial
World  Wide  Web  server   (http  daemon).   With  the  product,  database
administrators  can let users of their  Web hosts use a STAR database with
any   standard  web  browser,  thus  mitigating  the  need  to  distribute
proprietary client software.

The STAR system is widely used in libraries,  museums, government agencies
and other organizations who must index print and non-print collections.

Some special features of STAR/Web include:

   *  System administrators  can design  web pages for full-text  or index
   searches that include multiple input boxes.
