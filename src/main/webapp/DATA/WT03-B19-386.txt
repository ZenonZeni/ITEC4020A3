<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 221</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Second World Climate 
Conference</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Second World Climate Conference was an important step towards a global 
climate treaty.</B> Sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization WMO), the 
United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), and other international organizations, 
the conference was held in Geneva from 29 October to 7 November 1990. The 
Conference’s main objectives were to review the UNEP/WMO World Climate Programme 
(WCP) and to recommend policy actions. <P>
<B>With various international climate conferences stressing its importance, 
expectations for this conference were high.</B> The Conference was held at a crucial 
time in the climate treaty negotiation process. <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)</A> had completed its First Assessment Report in time for the conference, which 
in turn was to provide critical input for the first session of <A HREF = 
"fs209.html">the International Negotiating Committee for a 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC)</A>.<B> </B>The resulting 
Ministerial Statement, however, disappointed many of the participating scientists as well 
as other observers because it did not offer a high level of commitment. Nevertheless, the 
statement did represent, by virtue of its high political level and wide-spread participation, a 
critical step on the road to a treaty on climate change.<P>
<B>The scientists and technology experts at the Conference issued a strong 
statement highlighting the risk of climate change.</B> The first part of the Conference 
consisted of a series of non-governmental scientific sessions attended by 747 scientists and 
technology experts from around the world. In addition to 18 Expert Panels and Task 
Groups, the participants established a Consultation Group on Special Needs of 
Developing Countries. The resulting Statement of the Scientific and Technical Sessions 
made specific recommendations on the significance of <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A> for climate change; the use 
of climate information in assisting sustainable social and economic development; priorities 
for enhanced research and observational systems; public information; the impact of climate 
change on <A HREF = "fs104.html">water resources</A>, 
forests, <A HREF = "fs101.html">agriculture</A> and <A 
HREF = "fs127.html">food</A>, oceans, fisheries, and coastal 
zones; necessary changes in energy production and consumption patterns; the impact of 
climate change on land use, urban planning, and <A HREF = 
"fs116.html">human health</A>; and the implications of climate 
change for sustainable development.<P>
<B>The scientific statement also noted that <A HREF = 
"fs213.html">the First World Climate Conference</A>  
had urged states to foresee and prevent changes to the climate that might have 
adverse effects.</B> In the 11 years since then, it continued, a clear scientific consensus 
had emerged on the estimated range of global warming that is to be expected during the 
21st century. Accordingly, the Second World Climate Conference science meeting agreed 
that it was time for the world community to take strong measures to reduce sources and to 
increase "sinks" of greenhouse gases, despite the remaining scientific uncertainties: "If 
the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations is not limited, the predicted climate change 
would place stresses on natural and social systems unprecedented in the last 10,000 
years."<P>
<B>The Conference issued a Ministerial Declaration only after hard bargaining 
over a number of difficult issues.</B> The second part of the Conference consisted of 
discussions among heads of government and ministers from 137 states and the <A HREF 
= "fs211.html">European Community</A>. These discussions 
were preceded by preparatory negotiations between government officials, which were 
convened to prepare a text for submission to the ministers. A key issue was whether or not 
to set emissions targets and to refer specifically to carbon dioxide. The final declaration, 
adopted after hard bargaining, did not specify any internationally agreed targets. This 
omission provoked some criticism from delegates and observers who considered the EC 
target of achieving 1990 emissions levels for carbon dioxide by the year 2000 to be the 
minimum basis of an acceptable policy for developed countries.<P>
<B>Despite their difficulties, the participants did agree on a number of points.</B> 
The key agreements, included in the Declaration, were that participants<P>
	recognize a number of <A HREF = "fs202.html">principles 
that had emerged in international climate discussions</A>, including the concept of 
climate change as a common concern of humankind, the principle of equity and the 
common but differentiated responsibility of countries at different levels of development, 
the concept of sustainable development, and the precautionary principle;<P>
	stress the need for further scientific research on the causes and effects of climate change 
and recommend that this be done mainly through support of the World Climate 
Programme (WCP);<P>
	state that response measures must be adopted without delay, despite remaining scientific 
uncertainties;<P>
	urge developed states, which are responsible for 75% of the world’s emissions of 
greenhouse gases, to "establish targets and/or feasible national programmes or strategies 
which will have a significant effect on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases ...";<P>
	recognize that the emissions from developing countries must still grow to accommodate 
their development needs; nevertheless, these states should, with support from the 
developed nations and international organizations, take action; and<P>
	call for elaboration of a framework treaty on climate change and the necessary protocols 
- containing real commitments and innovative solutions - in time for adoption by <A 
HREF = "fs207.html">the UN Conference on Environment 
and Development (UNCED)</A> in June 1992. <P>
