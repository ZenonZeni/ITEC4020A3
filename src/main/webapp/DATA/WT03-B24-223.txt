<CENTER><h1>Putting together partners in Korea</h1></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><B>By Karen Bernstein<BR>
Editor-in-Chief</B></center><P>

When companies think "Asian markets," they generally think "Japan." But doing so risks missing out on opportunities in other Asian countries hungry for modern therapeutics. <P>

By focusing on Japan, companies also may mistakenly assume that all Asian countries are alike, whereas in reality the cultures and business structures are as varied as in Europe. Therefore putting together Asian partnering deals requires more than a knowledge of Japanese culture and pharmaceutical companies.<P>

For example, the Korean pharmaceutical sector is going through tremendous change, both in terms of the companies involved and government policy on issues that affect foreign companies wanting to do business in Korea. As always, periods of fluidity are periods of opportunity.<P>

<CENTER><B>Size of market</CENTER></B><P>

The Korean health care industry is well-developed for a country of its size -- about 44 million people, with health care accounting for 7 percent of manufacturing GNP, according to Roberts Mitani Inc. The New York company is an investment and banking firm that locates Asian capital for promising U.S. health care technologies, usually including a corporate component. At least a dozen Korean pharma companies have annual sales of more than $100 million, and Korea is one of the largest exporters of antibiotics and vaccines to the Southeast Asian and Chinese markets.<P>

According to Laurent Ayasse, managing director of Pacific Century Pte Ltd., the Korean pharmaceutical market is the third largest in Asia after Japan and China, with $3.2 billion in sales versus $37 billion in Japan.<P>

"If you look at Asia from a U.S. biotech point of view as 'Japan' -- full stop -- this is more and more completely wrong in terms of opportunities," said Ayasse, whose company is composed of a Hong Kong-based group of pharmaceutical executives who help find Asian partners and funding for U.S. companies.<P>

<CENTER><B>Two recent deals</CENTER></B><P>

"There's a huge Asian market ex-Japan that multinationals aren't well-equipped to commercialize," said Bruce Roberts, president of Roberts Mitani.<P>

Two recent deals have highlighted the potential of the Korean market as an untapped source of corporate partnerships. In September, Neoprobe Corp. granted Damon Pharm Ltd. marketing rights in Korea and certain other Asian countries for NEOP's RIGS system for the surgical detection and treatment of cancer. In May, Aviron (Burlingame, Calif.) and Sang-A, a member of the Hanbo Group conglomerate, entered into a vaccine collaboration. <P>

Sang-A made a 10-25 percent equity investment and will participate in future financings. Damon invested $1 million in NEOP and has an option to invest up to an additional $3 million by Nov. 30.<P>

The experiences of NEOP and Aviron in putting those deals in place, and the expertise of the middlemen who helped arrange the deals -- Roberts Mitani for NEOP and Pacific Century for Aviron -- provide a roadmap for other biotech companies interested in accessing the Korean market and partners.<P>


<CENTER><B>The Korean players</CENTER></B><P>

The Korean pharmaceutical market is bifurcated between more traditional, family held pharmaceutical companies, and companies that have come out of the large publicly held industrial conglomerates, called chaebol. Both have a long history of in-licensing and distributing products from Japanese, European, and occasionally, U.S. pharmaceutical companies.<P>

The family owned companies started a period of significant growth in the 1960s, selling OTC and ethical drugs, as well as herbal medicines and health tonics, in Korea and Southeast Asia. By the late 1960s, they had become relatively large pharmaceutical companies.<P>

The OTC and tonics markets became increasingly competitive. The tonics business could be especially profitable, but required a great deal of advertising, which cut margins. One way to maintain overall profits was to license in ethical drugs at low royalty rates, according to Roberts.<P>

By the early 1980s, these companies realized they couldn't pursue that model forever, because of international competition and the decreased willingness of suppliers to license their products and technologies at low cost. "The family firms with herbal medicines don't have a choice about moving into modern technology," said Ayasse. "The makers of tonic drinks also need higher value added products as advertising cuts into their returns."<P>

As multinational drug companies have established their own relationships with Korean hospitals and pharmacies, they have become less willing to go through an intermediary. "The multinational companies wanted higher royalties or to enter the Korean market themselves," said Jeffrey Oh, senior advisor and Korean specialist to Roberts Mitani. "This is very similar to what happened in Japan."<P>

<CENTER><B>Conglomerates enter</CENTER></B><P>

As a result, Korean companies started looking for products they could in-license and then develop themselves, rather than licensing finished compounds.<P>

By this time as well, the Korean conglomerates had noted the opportunities in pharmaceuticals, and chaebol such as Samsung, which made its name in semiconductors, set up pharma divisions. Samsung's pharma division was spun off in 1994 and is now independent. <P>

According to Vera Kallmeyer, vice president of business development at Aviron, Samsung has built a state-of-the-art hospital in Seoul, with a research center next door. "They have 62 research projects ongoing that they finance. They are investing in the future -- doing basic research on their own and looking for alliances in the U.S. So there's fairly high demand for high-tech from the U.S."<P>

Other chaebol that have entered pharmaceuticals include LG, one of the largest electronics companies in Asia, which operates a pharma company through its LG Chemical subsidiary. Sunkyong and Cheil also have pharma companies.<P>

"A lot of these big conglomerates are involved in construction, steel, and have made billions of dollars," said Kallmeyer. "They realize the future is in high value-added industry, so all are trying to get into the life sciences. It's like Japan was 20 years ago. Concurrently, a lot of the small, privately held, traditional medicine companies with unproven herbal medicines are realizing they have no future."<P>

Still, despite the resources of the pharmaceutical companies, and the interest in novel technologies, R&D as a percent of sales remains low -- about 3-4 percent according to Ayasse.<P>

<CENTER><B>Identifying the players</CENTER></B><P>

Kallmeyer believes that the main opportunity for U.S. companies is to ally with the chaebol. Aviron's partner, Sang-A, was a small, privately held pharmaceutical company purchased by Hanbo three years ago. The son of the chairman was put in charge with a mission to build a health care company.<P>

NEOP's partner, Damon, is a relatively new company, founded by former executives of Boryung Pharmaceuticals. It had turnover of just under $100 million in 1994, ranking it about number 12 or 13 in the Korean market. "The executives who formed it were seeing the new technology pass them by at Boryung, and they didn't want that to happen," said David Bupp, president of NEOP (Dublin, Ohio).<P>

Thus by the end of the 1980s, the family owned companies faced competition on two fronts: Korean conglomerates and Western multinationals starting to set up their own operations in Korea. This has left them with a choice of directions for the future, Roberts said: tying up with a conglomerate, as Sang-A did, focusing on consumer products, or finding ways to source high value-added products. Companies pursuing the latter course, he noted, is the group of interest to biotech companies.<P>

<CENTER><B>The role of the government</CENTER></B><P>

The government bureaucracy in Korea is in many ways similar to its Japanese counterpart, with elite status and power. However, according to Roberts Mitani, it is increasingly divided into two groups with different historical experiences: an older generation that is quite conservative and favors protectionism, and a younger generation that favors open markets and modernization, and is willing to bring in outside capital and to invest in foreign technology. <P>

As a result, said Oh, there is conflict within the bureaucracy, and industry gets mixed signals from the government. "My own reading is the government wants to open up and modernize industry," he said.<P>

There have been clear improvements in the area of intellectual property. "In the past, there was minimal protection for use and methodology patents," Roberts said. "Some companies found that patents would be duplicated and you couldn't successfully prosecute. That's improving a great deal with international harmonization, and in 1994, Korea announced that it will provide the same extent of protection as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office."<P>

That's also Kallmeyer's interpretation. The government is working to reset policies, particularly regarding trade barriers and intellectual property, she said. "The government is realizing that to compete, Korea needs a patent policy to Western standards, and they need state-of-the-art medicine to survive in the marketplace."<P>

The government also has adopted GMP standards for manufacturing, putting Korea in a position to be a Pacific Rim exporter for U.S. companies.<P>

The market also is becoming easier for foreign companies to enter. For a long time, Kallmeyer said, foreign companies weren't allowed to sell drugs under their own label. As a result, all the major international pharmaceutical companies have had to go through local Korean companies.<P>

That is changing, however, and the resulting competition has provided an impetus to the Korean companies to seek out stronger technologies. <P>

However, conflicting signals from the government still can cause problems at the level of the individual deal. "We have to put in a lot of time with the bureaucracy to understand how policy will be applied to a particular deal," Roberts said. "Even if the policy is clear, there are lots of exceptions in how it is interpreted. So we work closely with the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea."<P>

It takes time, for instance, to get permission to export capital, though that's hardly a problem unique to Korea. "That was the reason our deal, even though it was signed at the end of August, took until late September to announce," said Bupp.<P>

One thing that may be faster than in the U.S. is the regulatory process. NEOP anticipates starting a 9-12 month clinical trial of RIGScan in early 1996. The review cycle will be three months, Bupp said, meaning the product could be on the market in mid-1997.<P>

<CENTER><B>The role of the Korean banking community</CENTER></B><P>

As elsewhere in the Korean economy, relationships are changing between Korean companies and capital.<P>

The banking industry has been tied closely only to the electronics and automotive industries. In part that has been because the financial community has been dominated by government-owned banks or big conglomerates, and the banking sector has been required by the government to make subsidized loans to industries considered strategic. That has left little capital available to smaller, innovative companies -- again a situation similar to that in Japan.<P>

Oh said the financial and pharma communities are just now recognizing the upside of working together. "I feel like a matchmaker. Right now they're dating, and hopefully they will get engaged. To some degree they needed an outside party to do that."<P>

"A common concern of family controlled businesses is that they want to invest, but they are wary of investing in substantial upfront payments," said Roberts. "So the question is how to get a check written for that upfront amount."<P>

Sunkyong Securities Ltd.'s role in providing investment banking services in the NEOP deal was novel, he said. "Before this transaction, the only help the banking community would provide would be in the form of lending money to a Korean pharmaceutical company for very high interest rates, not on the basis of the potential of the novel technology.<P>
"
Venture capital also has been oriented to industrial products and computers, Ayasse said. "I don't know if that will change."<P>

<CENTER><B>The Korean health care market</CENTER></B><P>

All Korean citizens are insured by government-backed medical insurance. According to Oh, premiums are relatively low, service is good, and most products are reimbursed. Reimbursement decisions are made by a quasi-government entity whose members include physicians, bureaucrats, university professors and pharmaceutical executives.<P>

But even when products are declared reimbursable, it takes several years until a budget is appropriated to cover the product. For example, magnetic resonance imaging was made reimbursable in 1994, but procedures won't be fully reimbursed until 1996, because the funds have just been appropriated.<P>

Another difference with the U.S. health care system is the greater role of pharmacists, who have more discretion than their U.S. counterparts. Patients who aren't seriously ill will often go to pharmacists for treatment, which then will be confirmed with their doctors. Koreans also commonly use Chinese herbal medicines.<P>

<CENTER><B>Advice to U.S. companies</CENTER></B><P>

Even more so than in Japan, where many U.S. companies have contacts, and where there are several annual meetings to introduce U.S. companies to Japanese pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. side needs a local matchmaker with long-standing relationships. <P>

"It's appropriate to be introduced by a mutual friend," said Oh. "If I introduce myself cold turkey, there's a greater than 90 percent chance I won't get anything done. It's very important to use an intermediary who knows both sides and can communicate both parties' interests. That's been the practice for several hundred years."<P>

For NEOP, the ability to enter a candidate company at a high level made a difference. "At two companies we got referred to the manager of business development," Bupp said. "Those two situations became somewhat more protracted. On the two that came into the home stretch, we came in at the presidential/CEO level."<P>

Middlemen also can negotiate even when the U.S. company is back home, Kallmeyer said. "Through Pacific Century I usually knew ahead of time what the other side's position was, and they could explain my position or tell me if something was unacceptable."<P>

As might be expected, it is critical to learn about Korean business habits.<P>

Protocol is very important, from the proper forms of address to how to sit. For example, said John Ridihalgh, chairman and CEO of NEOP, "when you shake hands, if you want to show respect you put the other hand underneath your arm. You never pour your own beer -- you let somebody else pour it for you: usually someone from the other side, though not necessarily. There's a lot of ceremony."<P>

Hospitality is equally important. Executives are expected to bring a gift -- it doesn't have to be expensive. And when Korean executives come to the U.S., they will bring a gift here. Ridihalgh came home with a year's supply of ginseng tea. <P>


Companies coming to Korea will be entertained almost constantly. Knowing how to play golf, how to sing karioke, and how to drink are imperative. "You may not spend a minute by yourself," said Kallmeyer.<P>

Trusting relationships are built in part through sharing entertainment. "Relationships are everything that count in Korea," she said. "That's where the socializing comes in -- you have to drink together and sing together -- there's a lot of bonding that goes on."<P>

Those relationships can be more important than the product itself, short of a miracle cure that cures all ailments, Oh said. And informal meetings can be more important than formal ones: the former can be where the actual contract gets written.<P>

Some of this relationship-building may be easier than in Japan, because many Korean scientists speak English. Many receive their graduate or post-doctoral training in the U.S., and virtually all return to Korea, Kallmeyer said.<P>

<CENTER><B>Be later stage</CENTER></B><P>

Roberts Mitanyi also advises executives to study Korean history, culture and the Korean pharmaceutical industry, to learn how it modernized and where it's going.<P>

Companies looking for Korean partners should have a product at least in Phase II studies, if not in Phase III, Kallmeyer said. The ideal product will be in an area attractive in the Asian marketplace, such as hepatitis, cardiovascular disease, cancer and allergy, and it will have Korean patent protection, she said. <P>

As in many negotiations, it's best not to send the CEO or chairman of the company in at the beginning. "The system is very hierarchical," Kallmeyer said. "Whatever the CEO or chairman says is written in stone. So it's better to go in with a more junior person who can come back and say, 'My boss didn't agree with this.' It's also good to make meeting summaries and agree to them on both sides."<P>

In addition, unless the first meeting is with a very senior Korean executive, sending the CEO to make the initial presentation can send the message that there's a level of desperation on the U.S. side, Roberts said.<P>

Another rule of thumb for Korea, which is applicable elsewhere, is to know what you want. Korean companies typically want manufacturing rights, and they want to control the technology, said Bupp. "We had made the decision going in that we wanted to retain manufacturing and would supply a finished product. <P>

"By stating that very clearly, we eliminated some prospects, but we had clear objectives. If you don't do that until the end, both parties can walk away with a sour taste in their mouth."<P>

It's also important to read the hidden messages between the lines. "As in Japan, Koreans never say 'no,'" Kallmeyer said. "You have to read when the momentum is lost. The signals may be as subtle as having a dinner scheduled with the chairman and instead a manager shows up, or meetings get postponed."<P>

<CENTER><B>Quicker decisions</CENTER></B><P>

Although it varies, in some cases decisions in Korea can be made very quickly -- faster than in Japan. While it can still take time to do the due diligence, once a decision is made, the deal can be completed almost overnight, Oh said. <P>

"It's not like Japan, which is a bottom-up system," said Kallmeyer. "There are more privately held companies, 20-25 year old companies which the founder is still heading. If you can convince the top guy, it's a done deal."<P>

Bupp also felt that NEOP's deal went remarkably fast. The U.S. company started the process in early April. In June the two sides executed a letter of intent and in July a memorandum of understanding laying out the business terms was written. The deal was signed in August. <P>

"One advantage of doing business in countries like Korea or Singapore -- outside Japan -- is they're very straightforward business people," Bupp said. "They're hard negotiators, but when a decision is made, it's done very quickly. It's not a protocol-driven process. Here the scientists were brought in at the back side. In Japan you need to have the thought leaders buy in first -- that's one of the reasons it takes longer."<P>

As in Japan, once the deal is done, it's important to continue to invest in the relationship. "Americans tend to consider the contract a finished document," said Roberts. "Asians think of contracts as a starting point."<P>

With that in mind, it's critical to figure out ahead of time what kinds of operational support will be required by the Korean partner. Providing the proper support can also ensure that data generated in Korea will be applicable to regulatory submissions in other countries. <P>

For example, NEOP plans to pursue a stomach cancer indication for its RIGS products in Korea and will need to make sure that the Korean and U.S. protocols are in sync.<P>
