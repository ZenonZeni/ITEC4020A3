<TR><TD valign=top><H2>Madagascar's Indri</H2>

<P>Washington, DC:  The indri announces itself
in the eastern rain forests of Madagascar with its unmistakable,
eerie wailing song.  The largest of the lemurs, the indri uses
its long hind legs to hop through the canopy like a kangaroo while
looking for leaves and fruit to eat.  The indri, along with Madagascar's
other 31 lemur species, occur nowhere else in the world.  Environmental
destruction and hunting, however, severely threaten the indri
and other lemurs, which require large undisturbed ecosystems to
survive.  Slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, cattle-ranching,
and mining have altered about 80% of Madagascar's original forest
cover.  CI is working in the Zahamena Nature Reserve to ensure
the future of these unique primates and the habitats on which
they depend.

<P><H3>"Shade Coffee" Yields Global<BR> Conservation Opportunities</H3>

<P>Americans consume 350 million cups of coffee each day, and that's just a fraction of coffee consumption around the globe.  With over 11 million hectares in production, coffee is now the world's largest agricultural commodity.  Coffee, however, is typically grown on "sun farm" plantations that result in substantial clear-cutting of tropical rain forest.  Our high demand for coffee is linked to ecosystem destruction across the tro../resource/icons. 

<P>Organic "shade farm" coffee, however, represents
a significant opportunity to satisfy the demands of coffee-drinkers worldwide and make coffee cultivation more environmentally benign.
Grown under rain forest canopy, shade farm coffee has the potential to prevent deforestation, and hence, protect biodiversity. Comparing bird populations on plantations and shade farms offers compelling evidence: In a recent Smithsonian study, researchers
found 140 bird species near shade farms in Chiapas, Mexico, and only five or six on sun farms in the same vicinity.  Because organic coffee requires no agrochemicals, it also protects the health of local people and ecosystems.  

<P>CI is exploring
relations with coffee-grower organizations by providing financial and technical support to farmers who are introducing shade-grown, organic coffee.  To
ensure income for this niche in the coffee market, CI is also
working with US coffee importers and distributors to help increase
the size of organic-coffee markets.  "By providing this assistance
to shade farmers, CI hopes to use coffee as a major driver of
biodiversity conservation around the world," said Mike Saxenian,
CI's Senior Director for Conservation Enterprise.  "Gaining
the commitment of corporations to expand coffee markets will be
an important part of this process."</TD>

<TD valign=top><H3>Debt Swap a Boon for Mexico</H3>

<P>CI
and US AID have secured a debt-for-nature swap in Mexico that
will provide substantial funds for CI's conservation work
with the communities near the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in the Selva Lacandona region. The swap--the
first one since the Mexican government recently reauthorized such
exchanges--relieves Mexico of $488,000 worth of debt and generates
$336,500 to be spent exclusively on conservation projects.

<P><H3>CI Field Trips
</H3>
<P>In 1996, CI will be offering exclusive field trips
for our supporters and friends.  Our country program staff will
lead these custom-designed adventures to visit CI sites and beyond.
Destinations for the coming year are Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Panama, Botswana, Ghana, and Brazil.  For more information, please
call 800.406.2306.

<H3>CI Launches New Coastal<BR> Conservation Program
</H3>
<P>Washington, DC: Decreasing fisheries and rising numbers of endangered marine creatures are two indicators of a serious decline of marine habitats.  But our limited knowledge of ecosystems such as coral reefs hampers our abilities to protect their biological wealth.  Less than ten percent of
the world's oceans sampled for their diversity.  CI's Board of
Directors has recently approved a new coastal
conservation program that will systematically address these challenges.

<P>CI's new program, to be managed by CI staff member and marine
biologist Tim Werner, will focus on the protection of coral reefs, estuaries, and other coastal habitats, including high-priority regions such as Mexico's Gulf of California and the Tubbataha Reefs of the Philippines.  As with
its terrestrial programs, CI's marine strategy focuses on rigorous collection of scientific data to help NGOs and governments set conservation priorities, and the development of community-based economic alternatives.
