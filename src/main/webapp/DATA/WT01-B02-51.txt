<TITLE>Welcome from the IGARSS '94 Co-Chairmen</TITLE>
<H1>Welcome from the IGARSS '94 Co-Chairmen</H1>
<P>The staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory would like to welcome you
to Pasadena and the 1994 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing
Symposium (IGARSS'94).  IGARSS'94 is jointly sponsored by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' (IEEE) Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Society (GRSS), the International Union of Radio Science (URSI),
and, for the first time, the Optical Society of America (OSA).  We are
also fortunate to have the California Space Institute as a participant
this year. 
</P>
<P>The theme this year, "Surface and Atmospheric Remote Sensing:
Technologies, Data Analysis, and Interpretation," reflects the need to
view the Earth as a system of interrelated atmospheric, terrestrial, and
oceanic processes.  We would like to thank the technical chairmen Drs.
Eni Njoku, Robert Menzies, and Jurgen Richter for their time and
expertise in defining and developing our extensive technical program. 
Their efforts have resulted in nearly 1000 technical papers, an IGARSS
record.
</P>
<P>We hope you will visit "The User's Guide to the Data," an
interactive series of exhibits, hands-on demonstrations, and
presentations on the latest in data analysis and visualization.  A
number of recent data sets will be featured over the course of the
exhibit.  Also, this year marks the first time that the IGARSS Digest is
available on CD-ROM; we hope this provides a welcome change from the
still-available book format.</P> 
<P>We also look forward to seeing you at the annual baseball and soccer
games.  Take some time to enjoy Old Pasadena,the surrounding
entertainment centers, the dynamic natural "wonders,"  and the pleasant
ocean and beaches during your visit to Southern California!</P>
