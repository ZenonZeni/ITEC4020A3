<PRE>
This dept is dedicated towards the Organic Professional.
We are opened to hear from you and what you do, your location etc.
We plan on providing our members with information about organic
services and or products and let our readers find out about you. While
there is no charge to be listed here and let others know about you, you
have understand how our club works. We charge $100 per year for
commercial members. These are members that are in the business and are
looking for customers to buy their product(s) or service(s). So our
club which has over 6,000 world wide members, provides info on these
services or products. Regular membership is only $55 per life time. For
more information see <A HREF = th01003.htm>About Commercial IGA Membership...New Policy!</A>
 info page on our web site.
We are currently looking for organic services or products which we feel
would help our members achieve their goals of being 100% organic.
We are currently offering the first year free to anyone who wants to
join(subject to our approval). If you are interested please contact us
via email.
