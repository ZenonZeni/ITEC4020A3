<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>How to Purify Your Liver and Gallbladder</CENTER></H3>

This is a simple but powerful way to naturally detoxify your liver and gallbladder
and flush out toxins, even stones, according to chiropractor Anthony J. Cichoke, D.C.

<P>IMPORTANT! An organ flush like this is a good idea for  general health maintenance and is highly
recommended for people suffering from chronic degenerative diseases, such as
gallstones, backaches, and nausea, says Dr. Cichoke. This flush is for adults only,
not for children.

<P>For the first 6 days, drink as much apple cider, juice, or vinegar  (made from
organically grown apples) as your appetite can handle. Take a megavitamin supplement
that has more than the RDAs for vitamins and minerals. 

<P>Have a normal lunch at noon on day 7, then 3, hours later,
take 2 teaspoons of disodium phosphate (available over-the-counter as Fleet's
Phospho-Soda; follow package directions). Follow this immediately with a small amount
(2-4 ounces) of freshly squeezed citrus juice. If you're on a sodium-free diet, use
Epsom salts or castoria instead of disodium phosphate. Take a second dose of disodium
phosphate 3 hours later, followed by citrus juice. For dinner, have only grapefruit
juice (or other citrus juices, if you prefer).

<P><B>Step One:</B> When you're ready for sleep: 
<UL>
<LI>take 1/2 cup of warm, unrefined olive oil mixed with cup of freshly squeezed lemon
juice. 
<LI>or, take 1/2 cup of unrefined olive oil, then follow with 2-4 ounces of grapefruit
juice.  
</UL>

Dr. Cichoke says you may experience slight nausea from this but it will pass. In
bed, lie on your right side and pull your right knee up close to your chest. Hold
this position, without straining, for 30 minutes. 

<P><B>Step Two:</B> The next morning, on day 8, about 1 hour before you eat breakfast:  
<UL>
<LI>take 2 teaspoons of disodium phosphate mixed in 2 ounces of hot water. 
<LI>After breakfast, return to your normal diet. 
</UL>

You may begin noticing small gallstones or oddly-shaped gelatinous substances in your
feces. If so, repeat all the steps again (described above in the liver and
gallbladder flush) in 2 weeks' time

<P>
Dr. Cichoke advises that you have on hand homeopathic Magnesium Phosphate (in
strengths of 6x or 12x) in case you experience sharp pain as your liver and gall
bladder detoxify. Take 3 pills every 3 hours until  the pain g 3 hours until  the
pain goes away; then take no more pills.  While pain during the gall bladder
flush is rare, it's prudent to be prepared.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Enlarged Prostate-How to Use Natural Remedies for Relief</CENTER></H3>

For men under 45, difficulties with urination are often due to prostatitis, which is
an infection of the prostate gland. Men over 45 with urinary problems tend to have a
condition called &quot;benign prostatic hyperplasia,&quot; which means too many cells have
grown inside the prostate gland, thereby swelling it. In either case, herbalism has a
practical remedy, acd, thereby swelling it. In either case, herbalism has a practial
remedy, according to Varro E. Tyler, Ph.D., Sc.D., and James F. Balch, M.D., in
information drawn from two separate books. 
<A NAME="palmett">  </A>
 <P>SAW PALMETTO. This herb consists of the dried ripe fruit of a small scrubby palm
tree. Saw palmetto increases urinary flow, reduces urine ne retention, and generally
eases symptoms of prostate enlargement by reducing inflammation.  Recommended dosage:
1-2 g daily of dried herb or 320 mg of saw palmetto liquid extract (prepared with 90%
alcohol).
<A NAME="netroot"> </A>
<P>NETTLE ROOT. The root of stinging nettle is aas also effective for prostate problems.
 Recommended dosage: 4-5 teaspoons (4-6 g daily), preferably in the form of a tea, as
the active ingredients are water-soluble. 
<A NAME="NETTLE"> </A>
<P>NETTLE LEAVES. You can also use nettle leaves to increase urine flow. Recommended
dosagege: 3-4 teaspoons of dry herb boiled in 5 ounces of water. Drink nettle leaves
as a tea, 3-4 times daily until symptoms improve.

<P>NUTRIENTS. Take these nutrients daily: Zinc (80 mg); bee pollen (6 tablets or 2
teaspoons); essential fatty acids (2 cap(2 cappapsules, 3 times); Kyolic garlic
capsules (2 capsules, 3 times); raw glandular prostate tablets (per label
directions); vitamin A (25,000 I.U., of which at least 15,000 I.U are beta-carotene);

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>A Nutritional &amp; Herbal Answer to Fatigue</CENTER></H3>

A Nutritional &amp; Herbal Answer to Fatiritional &amp; Herbal Answer to Fatigue
If you find yourself unaccountably tired too much of the time, take another look at
your diet, says Melvyn Werbach, M.D. High carbohydrate meals and a high use of
caffeine and sugar may be draining your energy at the source. Coffee in small
amounttunts may temporarily energize you, but if you're consuming it in the range of
25.35 oz a day or more, you may get more fatigue than energy for your cups. 

<P>If you are deficient in certain B-vitamins, such as folic acid, pantothenic acid, or
B12, this  this is may account for your low energy.  Consider supplementing your diet
with 10 mg daily of folic acid, 250 mg daily of pantothenic acid, and 1000 mcg of B12
once weekly for a month, and see if you don't feel perkier. While you're at it, if
you're low in vitamin C, iron, magnesium, potassium, or zinc, you're likely to be a
little too fatigued for comfort. 

<P>And don't overlook the possibility that you are sensitive, if not allergic, to
certain foods in your diet, which can produce &quot;allergic-tension fatigue
synnsyndrome.&quot; Typical culprits here can include dairy products, chocolate,  and cola
beverages. 
<A NAME="gins"> </A>
<P>On the positive side of fatigue, here is a quick and easy herbal step you
can take to shore up your energy. Take Panax ginseng or Siberian ginseng as an herbal
tincture at the rate of 100 mg twice daily for a few days.  Ginseng, one of the
oldest general tonics from Traditional Chinese medicine, sharpens  mental abilities,
concentration, alertness, and improves stamina, and delays the onset of fatigue after
physical exercise.

MEMORY LOSS. You can strengthen your memory using herbs and nutrition according to
this formula, says nutrition expert Robert M. Giller, M.D.  Here's what to take: 
<UL><LI>Gingko biloba (40 mg, 3-4x daily) 
<LI>choline (650 mg, 3x daily)

<LI>zinc (50 mg, once daily) 
</UL>

Take this formula for at least 2 months and  enjoy the improvements in your memory.
<A NAME="INSOM"> </A>
<P>INSOMNIA.  Here is a natural approach for falling asleep within minutes after your
head hits the pillow, according to Dr. Giller.  If you are on conventional
medications for health problems, find out if any of these are known to interrupt
sleep cycles. Then: 

<UL><LI>Don't eat big dinners within 3 hours of going to bed. 
<LI>Don't have caffeinated coffee or other stimulants with dessert. 
<LI>Try eliminating all caffeine-based products for a couple of weeks until
your sleep improves. 
<LI>Give up smoking or at least don't smoke within 2 hours of sleeping. 
<LI>Don't think about your job or any personal worries before going to bed. 
<LI>Don't read or watch anything overly stimulating before bed. 
<LI>If you're tired or sluggish during the day, don't take a nap; try exercising
instead. 
<LI>Get at least 20 minutes of regular exercise during the day. 
<LI>Try to go to bed at night and get up in the morning at a fixed  time
regularly.
<LI>Eat foods that are rich in L-tryptophan, an amino acid that helps your brain slow
down; these include tuna, turkey, and dairy milk. 
<LI>Take 2 capsules of the herb valerian 1 hour before bedtime. Wash it down 
with a cup of warm passionflower tea.
<LI>Take calcium (1200 mg) before bedtime. 
<LI>Try melatonin supplements (2 mg nightly for 2 weeks). 
</UL>
<A NAME="SINUSI"> </A>
SINUSITIS. A patient once described a sinus infection as &quot;like being under hundreds
of feet of water without a diving helmet,&quot; says Dr. Giller. If this is how you feel,
then:
<UL>
<LI>Drink 6-8 glasses of pure water daily, or the same amount of herbal
teas, broths, and soups. 
<LI>Take hot showers and baths.  Fill a sink or large pot with hot water, lean over the
pot, put a towel over your head and pot, then slowly, deeply, inhale the steamy warm 
air. 
<LI>Apply warm compresses to your eyes and nose for pain relief. Place your thumb and
index finger at the top of your nose on either side and press gently for a few
moments. Repeat this several times a day. 
<A NAME="acetyl"> </A><LI>Take vitamin C (1-2 g daily), vitamin A (10,000 I.U. daily), and N-acetyl-cysteine,
derived from an amino acid (200 mg, 3 times daily for adults, 200 mg 2 times daily
for children).
