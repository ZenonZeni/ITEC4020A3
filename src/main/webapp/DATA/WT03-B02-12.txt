AMERINET REJECTS OWENS & MINOR'S 1% PRICE
INCREASE

By Richard Haugh
Owens & Minor Inc.'s attempt to pass on a 1% across-the-board
price increase didn't work--at least not with AmeriNet Inc., St.
Louis. "We chose not to take prices [to our members] up 1%," said
Greg Mosley, vice president of AmeriNet's ValuNet division.

Owens' Sept. 15, 1995, announcement of the price increase
("Hospitals frustrated by Owens' spotty distribution performance,"
HMM, October 1995, p. 1) didn't sit well with AmeriNet, and
Mosley said the group suggested to Owens that the two sit down
and look at alternatives. With $2.76 billion of contracted purchases
in 1995--$1.1 billion of which was in medical-surgical supplies--
AmeriNet was in a position to make such a call, and Owens listened.

Mosley said AmeriNet and Owens "arrived at an understanding"
with the Richmond, Va.-based distributor that allows Owens to
assess fees for various services it provides to AmeriNet's 4,500-
plus member facilities, while retaining a modified cost-plus
structure.

Tom Sherry, Owens' vice president of sales and marketing, said the
new contract, while an immediate reaction to AmeriNet's displeasure
with the 1% price increase, is more an interim step on the road from
traditional cost-plus pricing to a full risk-sharing arrangement. "The
problem is that a lot of hospitals are not ready for full activity-based
costing, and this interim contract is an attempt to address that
concern," he said.

The New Activity Fees

In a Dec. 1, 1995, memo to purchasing and materials management
directors, Mosley outlined the changes it is making to its contract
with Owens, effective Dec. 1, 1995. While the new contract makes
changes in the cost-plus tier structure, more notably the new contract
calls for the addition of these eight activity-based fees:

+ 0.25% addition to distribution fees for each delivery in excess of
two per week.

+ $1.25 per mile charge to a facility for any delivery in excess of
100 miles from the distribution center.

+ 1% added charge for electronic order entry if the order is less than
50% of items ordered.

+ 0.5% added charge for electronic order entry if the order is less
than 90% of items ordered.

+ 3.5% service fee for "non-traditional" vendor products.

+ $0.10 per label charge for patient charge labeling.

+ 2% PAL service charge.

+ $0.85 per line item surcharge during any month in which the
average line order is less than $150 per line.

Sword Cuts Both Ways

In putting together the new agreement, Mosley said AmeriNet felt
that if Owens wanted to charge its member facilities activity fees,
"then the sword cuts both ways." The result was provisions for
AmeriNet facilities to charge Owens with penalty fees for not
meeting specific service levels:

+ A required 96% fill rate on committed items (mutually agreed
upon between Owens and the facility and ordered at least twice a
month). If the fill rate drops below 96% for any two consecutive
months, Owens must pay the facility $200.

+ Owens must pay a facility $200 if, "after proper notification to
Owens," it is proved that Owens charged the facility incorrect
pricing for two consecutive months and no response or adjustment
is made. In an apparent bow to Owens' efforts to get its balky
computer system operating smoothly, this penalty doesn't go into
effect until April 1.

Too Early To Judge Reaction

Two weeks after distribution of the memo, it was still too early to
gauge member reaction, Mosley said, with responses predictably
negative from hospitals to be most heavily affected. Size doesn't
appear to be a factor; instead, the level of efficiency of operations
has more bearing--the more efficient, the less impact the fees will
have. In fact, Mosley said, those hospitals willing to modify their
operations to be more efficient may actually see little impact from the
agreement. Conversely, those facilities that don't could wind up
paying close to the equivalent of Owens' originally requested 1%
price increase.

The agreement is not cast in stone. "We certainly hope as time goes
by this will work out for all the parties concerned," Mosley said.
But if it doesn't, AmeriNet and Owens are ready to discuss
modifications.

AmeriNet's systemwide Dec. 1 move was apparently the first by a
major GPO to change from the traditional cost-plus only
arrangement to introducing service fees. Mosley said he thinks there
are limited programs in place with similar arrangements--in fact,
Owens has a name for a program it has been marketing for some
time: Cost Track--but he doesn't think they are being used to any
great extent. With the development of more sophisticated data
collection processes, though, that is likely to change. (At press time
HMM learned that VHA Inc., Irving, Texas, has modified its
Authorized Distribution Agreement with Owens to also allow for
activity based fees, and Owens is working on an activity-based fee
agreement with Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., Nashville, Tenn.)

"I don't think we'll be unique in the industry as time goes by,"
Mosley said. "The days of distributors giving its services away for
free just because a customer asks for them are gone."

Sherry said he is unaware if Owens competitors, like Baxter
Hospital Supply Corp., McGaw Park, Ill., and General Medical
Corp., Richmond, Va., have similar contracts, but that they likely
will in the future. Indeed, a major topic of discussion at the October
meeting of the Health Industry Distributors Assn. was activity-based
fee programs.

Industry Sentiment Changing?

Industry sentiment against activity fees may be dissolving as players
realize distributors can be squeezed only so far (see related story on
page 11). Margins are razor-thin now, leaving little room for error,
as Owens itself proved when it ran into problems digesting its 1994
acquisition of the former Stuart Medical Inc. When service levels fell
while trying to assimilate Stuart's operational system into the Owens
way of operating, the company quickly fell into financial purgatory,
which triggered its attempt at a price increase.

While that attempt is generally not succeeding (GPOs contacted by
HMM either flatly stated that they wouldn't accept the increases, or
hedged their answers, saying they are exploring various options;
and industry sources have told HMM that Owens is backing off the
increases in one form or another for its major customers), few
dispute the fact that distributors need to boost their margins. Pete
DeBusk, president of DeRoyal Industries Inc., Powell, Tenn.,
summed it up: "The industry must sit up and take notice that there
will be further price increases, especially for distribution, and it's to
our benefit to support distributors. We shouldn't take a hostile
approach to the needs of the distribution business."

Health industry consultant William McFaul, of McFaul & Lyons
Inc., Trenton, N.J., said much of the resistance to activity fees is
coming from the materials management community, and he thinks
that resistance may be misplaced. He said materials managers need
to concentrate on partnerships with their distributors. "This is a
good thing," he said. "Materials managers need to do a cost
accounting analysis. If it's only going to cost me a few thousand
dollars to get the services I need or want, it's pocket change. For a
distributor, though, that goes directly to the bottom line."

While Owens takes the point on the charge into new pricing
territory--and the heat that goes with it--Sherry thinks eventually
customers will see "that this is not an Owens problem, but an
industry problem, and needs to be addressed."

"THE JUICE ISN'T WORTH THE SQUEEZE;" SYRINGE AND
NEEDLE PRICES HOLD STEADY

Increases in the prices hospitals and group purchasing organizations
pay for needles and syringes have slowed to a virtual standstill, with
average prices for syringes rising only 0.9% and average prices for
needles rising only 0.7%. Putting the brakes on price increases
reverses the trend of rapid price increases seen in last year's HMM
price survey of this high-volume, low-price commodity item, when
prices increased an average of 6.6% from the previous year.

This year's study again included products manufactured by the two
market leaders, Becton Dickinson & Co., Franklin Lakes, N.J., and
St. Louis-based Sherwood Medical Co. Sherwood is the maker of
the popular Monoject line of needle and syringe products. Prices for
Terumo Corp., Somerset, N.J., were requested, but only one price
was supplied by hospitals or group purchasing executives.

Last year's prediction by purchasing executives of stable prices in
1995 proved true. And not one of the executives responding this
year expects prices to rise any time soon. In fact, one executive
thinks prices may drop slightly. "We are in a very competitive
market, and the major players want to hold on to their share of the
market," this director of materials management of an 800-plus bed
hospital on the East Coast said.

Interestingly, while competition is cited as the reason costs are being
held in check, one purchasing executive thinks most hospitals
remain loyal to their current supplier. "Changing needle and syringe
brands is a hassle and the savings are insignificant. The juice is not
worth the squeeze," this exec said.

While competition is the most significant factor keeping the lid on
prices, two respondents--both group purchasing organizations--cited
the rising cost of raw materials as exerting upward pressure on
costs.

Use Probably Won't Rise Next Year

Most hospitals and groups expect usage of these products to stay the
same or decrease in the next year, with about half of all respondents
saying they don't expect their volumes to change. Those looking for
decreases cite the rising popularity of needleless systems as the
reason, saying safety considerations and a reduction in the number
of needle sticks are playing an increasingly important role. One
director echoed prevailing industry trends, saying the number of
hospitals represented by his group is falling.

The respondents who think their use of needles and syringes will
increase tracks with their historical use; if use has been going up, it
probably will continue to rise, while if use has been flat, use will
stay flat or fall.

In a market dominated by commodity items, on which apparently
pricing has been driven to rock bottom, incentives offered by
manufacturers are apparently not a major factor. While most
responding to the HMM survey said price discounts are available
based on volume and compliance, few other goodies are being
dangled. One group purchasing organization has a conversion
allowance available to offer to member hospitals if they convert to
90% use of Sherwood products, and one Midwestern hospital
receives a 3% rebate twice a year based on purchase volume.

Syringe Prices Up 0.9%

Prices for syringes included in the survey rose somewhat higher
than needle prices, and compared to HMM's survey of syringes and
needles in January 1995 the direction of prices reversed and started
to climb. The current average price for all syringes, regardless of
manufacturer, was just shy of 13 cents at $0.1299 in 1995. That
compares with 1994's average prices for all syringes of $0.1287,
for a 0.9% increase compared to last year's survey, which showed
prices of syringes dropping 0.46% from 1993 levels.

Of the 18 syringe models included in the survey, 14 increased in
price. The two syringes registering the largest price increase were
Becton Dickinson model 309540 1cc 25 x 5/8" needle, up 6.0% to
an average price of $0.0721; and Monoject model 512936 12cc no-
needle Luer lock, up 3.1% to an average price of $0.726.

Of the 18 syringes in the survey, only three dropped in price.
Becton Dickinson model 309570 3cc 25 x 5/8" needle fell 1.6% to
an average price of $0.0491. And the Monoject model 516937 6cc
syringe no-needle Luer lock fell 1.2% to an average price of
$0.0682.

The last of the 18 syringes--Monoject model 535713 35cc syringes
no needle luer lock--did not change in average price from last year.

Needle Prices Up 0.7%

Prices for needles included in the survey rose slightly less than
syringe prices, and compared to HMM's survey of syringes and
needles in January 1995, the rate of increase was slower than 1994.
The current average price for all needles, regardless of
manufacturer, was just shy of 3 cents, at $0.284. That compares
with 1994's average prices for all needles of $0.0282, for a 0.7%
increase compared to last year's survey, which showed prices of
needles rising from 1993 levels by 3.8%.

Of the 10 needle models included in the survey, six increased in
price, all but one of them Monoject models. The one Becton
Dickinson needle, model 305145 23 x 1" needle, rose a whopping
29.1%, climbing to $0.0373 each from 1994 levels of $0.0289
each. Five Monoject models showed a uniform increase of 1.1%
across all five numbers, rising to an average price last year of
$0.0277.

Of the 10 needles in the survey, four dropped in price, all Becton
Dickinson models. Two showed price decreases of 6.9%: B-D
model 305195 18 x 1" needle, and model 305196 18 x 1.5" needle.
Two others showed price decreases of 5.2%: B-D model 305175 20
x 1", and model 305176 20 x 1.5" needle.

Overall prices for Becton Dickinson syringes increased by 1.6%,
while Monoject syringes increased by 0.8%. Overall B-D needle
prices increased by 1.0%, while overall Monoject needles increased
by 1.1%. Becton Dickinson's syringe and needle product lines
increased an overall average of 1.5%, while for Monoject the
syringe and needle product lines increased an overall average of
0.9%.

Survey Analysis

HMM received responses from five major group purchasing
organizations representing 1,278 hospitals and more than 280,000
beds. Four stand-alone hospitals representing more than 2,800 beds
also were included in the responses.

Most survey respondents reported that they are using sole-source
contracts for needles and syringes. Sole-source contracts provide
better pricing, local distribution and a guaranteed safety stock. In
recent years, locking into a sole- source contract has brought with it
rebates ranging from 2% to 3%.

HMM's survey was conducted in early December 1995.

In all, U.S. hospitals and other health care facilities spent an
estimated $450 million in 1994 on disposable needles and syringes,
according to figures furnished by the consulting firm of Frost &
Sullivan, Mountain View, Calif.

WHEN DOES BIG BECOME TOO BIG?

Hospitals and integrated systems will be the winners in the latest
round of mergers, which saw SunHealth Alliance Inc., Charlotte,
N.C., join the ranks of American Healthcare Systems (AmHS), San
Diego, and Premier Health Alliance Inc., Westchester, Ill.--
themselves so recently merged they still don't have a name.

The move created the largest health care network in the country. It
includes 240 owned systems operating 650 hospitals with one-third
of the country's beds (about 315,000), as well as another 1,000
affiliate members in all 50 states. SunHealth adds more than 300
not-for-profit hospitals and health care organizations stretched
across the southeastern United States. Annual purchasing volume
adds up to more than $10 billion, and vaults the group past the
Nashville, Tenn.-based for-profit chain Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp.

While the new supergroup has not decided how purchasing and
contracting operations between the three former individual GPOs
will be consolidated, one thing is predicted: Members that stay in the
organization will likely benefit from an estimated $400 million to
$500 million in additional price concessions the new group is
expected to wring from suppliers.

Premier and AmHS have committed to developing long-term, sole-
source agreements with vendors and will demand high compliance
from members to guarantee the purchasing volume vendors will
expect in exchange for low pricing. The addition of SunHealth's
hospitals and $1.8 billion of purchasing certainly will help that goal
along.

But voices in the purchasing wilderness are questioning just how
many more concessions suppliers can grant. In talking with GPOs,
hospitals and consultants, HMM heard a similar sentiment: Prices
may be as low as they'll go, and there isn't much room left for
dickering. Suppliers and distributors can't get into the position of
"losing a little bit of money on each transaction, but making it up in
volume," as one exec said.

Without the lure of ever-lower prices, observers wonder, are there
other benefits to being big that will make it worthwhile to stay a
member of the new megagroup?

A senior executive of one group purchasing organization thinks
hospitals and integrated systems are becoming concerned that being
too big, too national, could wind up hurting them. Adding
competing hospitals to an already competitive marketplace could
drive members to bail out of the new AmHS-Premier-SunHealth.
Premier and AmHS executives downplay that, saying competitive
conflicts among members would be rare. (Before SunHealth joined
the fray, AmHS and Premier hospitals competed head-to-head in 10
major markets and a handful of smaller ones. SunHealth now adds
eight more markets with conflicts.) They have given members in
competing markets one year to work out their differences, or face
having one of the members booted out.

And, as integrated health providers evolve, many think these
providers will increasingly shift their emphasis to receiving more
customized service on a regional level, service a huge national
organization may have trouble delivering.

Smaller GPOs around the country are gloating over that possibility.
They think the confusion and possible member shakeout will let
them reap benefits. "There are a lot of unhappy (member) campers
out there," one GPO executive vice president said. Another
predicted groups will waste no time whispering in the ears of those
discontented campers, extolling the virtues of their own smaller
organizations.

This is not lost on VHA Inc., Irving, Texas, stung by the apparent
defection of SunHealth when it thought it was well along the path to
its own merger with the group. In a statement released in response
to the merger, VHA said it will be ready. "As local markets
consolidate and managed care networks continue to develop, we
anticipate that many current members of other alliances will align
with our members and ultimately join VHA," the statement said.

INDIANA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GOES
STOCKLESS--AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH BAXTER

If at first you don't succeed...

After signing a just-in-time agreement in November 1993 with the
old Stuart Medical Inc., the 610-bed two-hospital Indiana University
Medical Center (IUMC), Indianapolis, saw Stuart purchased by
Owens & Minor Inc., Richmond, Va. The hospital system then
attempted a less-than-successful move to stockless with Owens in
August 1994. In April 1995 IUMC signed on with the ValueLink
program of Baxter Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, Ill. The third
time seems to be the charm, said IUMC's director of pharmacy and
material services, Carol Birk.

The switch to Baxter has allowed IUMC to close its 85,000-sq. ft.
warehouse and convert it to record keeping support and forms
storage. At its Indianapolis warehouse, Baxter affixes patient charge
bar codes as items are picked, and then ships in lowest unit of
measure at least once a day to the hospital.

IUMC and Baxter are working on plans to consolidate into the
available hospital warehouse space a number of functions, including
transport, linen handling and purchasing. Baxter is also working on
100% freight consolidation at its warehouse, where it now handles
1,500 parcels each week. Birk said since going stockless with
Baxter, the distributor has lost only one package, worth about $300.

The distributor supports a core list of 2,900 line items at its
warehouse and maintains an inventory of $2.8 million to $3 million
for IUMC. The hospital's material services unit purchases about
$19.4 million annually, about $18 million of that through Baxter.
Going stockless and eliminating central distribution operations at the
hospital allowed IUMC to cut its central distribution inventory levels
to current levels of about $20,000 from $400,000 to $500,000.

Under the new program, Baxter also took over several other
distribution operations. As a springboard to distribution within the
hospital, Baxter employees now operate the receiving dock and log
in each shipment. Supplies are then distributed to 856 ship-to
locations at IUMC. At any one time the two hospitals have a total of
$129,000 of material on site, about $55,000 of which is on case
carts, divided among 300 to 400 line items, kept as backup stock in
satellite areas at each of the two hospitals. In addition, Baxter
handles distribution of linens, which Birk said results in significant
savings by eliminating double handling and removing the "train"
operation of moving linens.

By transferring operations to Baxter, IUMC was able to reduce staff
by 150 employees, 13 of whom Baxter hired for its operation. The
hospital has transferred supply stocking duties at the ship-to
locations to pharmacy technicians. "We now have total integration,"
Birk said. "Pharmacy managers are responsible for all materials
functions."

To facilitate the stockless program, IUMC is starting to implement
handheld devices to maintain par levels. While the technology was
available to make the jump directly to the handhelds and EDI when
Baxter took over, because of the reduction in staff and requisite
training of new people, IUMC is making the transition using a paper
system.

IUMC's savings with the stockless program have been significant.
Reducing excess inventories created a one-time savings of $2
million, while reducing FTEs produced on-going savings of $2.2
million, even after paying the cost of additional Baxter employees.
IUMC next plans to look to Baxter's Procedure Based Delivery
System to reduce costs in the hospital system's operating rooms.

DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT PURCHASES DOWN IN 1995 FOR
THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW

Consolidation and uncertainty continue to put the brakes on hospital
purchases of big-ticket diagnostic imaging equipment. For the
second year in a row, hospitals have used the time they spend on
consolidation efforts to take a breather and reassessed their asset
management programs--without spending much money.

In its fifth annual study on purchasing trends for diagnostic imaging
equipment, Comdisco Inc., Rosemont, Ill., reported all types of
imaging equipment are showing an increase in average age,
indicating sluggish purchasing activity. Comdisco Medical
Equipment Group's president, Kenneth Halverson, isn't surprised.
"As hospitals come together in a network, they have critical
technology asset management problems to address," he said. "They
need to assess what equipment they have, where it's located and
how it fits strategically in the new organization. There are almost
certainly going to be redundancies."

Conclusions of the report:

+ MRI systems were hardest hit. Average age of installed MRIs is
5.5 years, up from 3.1 in 1992. Seventy percent of MRIs are more
than three years old, compared with 35% in 1992.

+ Radiography/fluoroscopy is the oldest technology, with an
average age of 10.1 years, up from 7.9 years in 1992. Almost 66%
of these systems are more than seven years old, and 20% are more
than 15 years old.

+ Seventy-five percent of CT scanners are more than three years
old, up from 64% in 1994.

+ Cardiac catheterization labs are installed in 31% of hospitals, up
from 20% in 1993.

+ Eighty-four percent of nuclear medicine devices are more than
three years old.

Comdisco predicted the drought in purchasing could be ending,
though. It said the company is entering 1996 with a record backlog
of orders.

The Comdisco report analyzed information on the penetration,
distribution and age of diagnostic equipment at more than 3,600
U.S. hospitals. The hospitals were surveyed about ultrasound,
MRI, computed tomography, cardiac catheterization, angiography
suites, radiography- fluoroscopy and nuclear medicine.

CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE POWERHOUSE FORMED;
MATERIALS MANAGEMENT IMPACT UNKNOWN

While the merger of three Catholic health care systems into a new
umbrella system called Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI), to be
headquartered in Denver, will make it the country's largest Catholic
system, the effect on materials management and purchasing won't
be known until early 1996.

The new system's formation, first reported in HMM in September
1995 ("Colorado Catholic hospitals under new regional umbrella,"
HMM, September 1995, p. 19), will combine 11 religious
congregations in 21 states and bring together 63 acute care hospitals
representing 10,400 beds, as well as more than 50 alternate site
facilities. CHI will have projected annual revenues in excess of $4
billion. That pulls CHI well ahead of what was formerly the
country's largest Catholic system, St. Louis-based Daughters of
Charity, which had 1995 revenues of $3.2 billion.

CHI results from the merger of Sisters of Charity Health Care
Systems, Cincinnati; Catholic Health Corp., Omaha, Neb.; and
Franciscan Health System, Aston, Pa. CHI will be divided into five
operating regions, with headquarters in Denver. CHI's Rocky
Mountain Region office also will be in Denver.

An office headed by John DiCola, currently vice president of
strategic development for Sisters of Charity Health Care Systems,
will provide for the nationwide system centralized services like
purchasing and materials management functions, as well as benefits,
insurance educational programs, financial services and consulting.
Other services could be added in the future. The division will be
called CHI Service Organization and be located in Cincinnati.

It is not certain how the materials management functions of the three
systems will be integrated. Franciscan Health System's materials
management operations are headed by George Hersch, while Sisters
of Charity's vice president of materials management is Paul De
Salvo. Catholic Health Corp. does not have centralized materials
management, but handles the function at each hospital.

Consolidation of materials functions is almost certain, but CHI
spokespersons said it is not yet clear what the new structure will be.
No one would speculate officially on the future of materials
management staffers, other than to say there is more than enough
work in the new system to go around for everyone involved--and
then some.

It's unlikely the merger will affect purchasing and contracting, since
national contracts are negotiated through the Catholic Materials
Management Alliance, St. Louis. As one executive of the new
system said, even with the size of CHI, systems (including
Daughters of Charity) need the leverage of CMMA to cut the best
deals. What could be affected, though, is the myriad of regional
deals the three players will have--such as services contracts, back
office functions, sterilization services, natural gas and products that
are proprietary to a region.

LONG ISLAND COLLEGE HOSPITAL RETROFITS AND
UPGRADES WILL SAVE $4.4 MILLION

Fresh from a seven-year contract that saved it $923,000 in its first
year and $6.8 million over the life of the contract, the Long Island
College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y., is entering a second seven-
year agreement with Honeywell Inc., Minneapolis, that is
guaranteed to save an additional $4.4 million.

The 601-bed facility launched the second phase of the agreement in
fall 1995. It calls for Honeywell to retrofit lighting in the hospital
and install energy-efficient motors on air-handling units, as well as
install a fire alarm system, a 300-ton chiller plant, an HVAC system
in laboratory buildings, and a boiler plant retrofit. Also included in
the contract is a new building automation system that will integrate
the operating room, blood bank data, materials management and
billing systems. Long Island expects the new system will reduce
inventory costs and result in faster, more accurate billing
information.

Over the seven-year life of the contract, Honeywell guarantees Long
Island operational savings of $4.4 million, which the hospital will
use to pay Honeywell for the equipment and work. If actual savings
don't meet that level, Honeywell will pay the hospital the difference.
At the end of the contract Long Island will own all of the equipment,
and savings that had been repaying Honeywell will be the hospital's
to keep.

The first phase, completed in June 1994, involved updating
mechanical and control systems throughout the hospital.

CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS JOIN TO STUDY WAYS TO DRIVE
COSTS FROM THEIR SYSTEMS

A group of 18 children's hospitals, representing 4,003 beds, has
banded together to develop a database of information designed to
identify areas for cost reduction. The effort, dubbed Synergistic
Advantages, began last spring when the group proposed nearly 20
areas to examine in hospital operations. From those, four or five
areas will be selected to pursue in more detail in 1996.

The program draws participants from a number of areas at the 18
hospitals, including nursing, pharmacy and materials management.
The first phase of the study involves developing a database to
provide participants with benchmarking capabilities. Areas to be
examined include cath lab supply management, per diem and
procedure-based supply management, specialty bed utilization, linen
management, systems integration and electronic data interchange,
and outsourcing.

The hospitals are located around the country, and together account
for about $150 million in annual medical-surgical supply
purchasing. The group is hoping to identify areas from which to
generate savings of 5% to 10%.

EGG CRATES ARE OUT, SAVINGS ARE IN AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MED. CENTER

The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Omaha,
Neb., replaced almost all of its conventional hospital mattresses
Nov. 1, 1995, with new pressure relief mattresses called DeCubes,
manufactured by Comfortex Inc., Winona, Minn. The purchase of
the 221 new mattresses for $78,600 will allow the 324-bed hospital
to virtually eliminate nearly $100,000 in annual purchases of foam
overlay ("egg crate") mattresses. In addition, the hospital will be
able to significantly cut back the $176,000 it spent last year on
specialty bed rentals.

The choice of the new mattresses was driven by simple economics,
said Mickey Bradshaw, manager of materials support services for
UNMC. Pressure ulcers contribute to more than 60,000 deaths each
year and cost the health care system more than $9 billion annually,
much of it not reimbursable by Medicare and other insurance
organizations. Industry estimates are that between 3% and 11% of
patients admitted to a hospital or nursing home develop pressure
ulcers. The cost of treating those sores ranges from $5,000 to
$40,000 per patient. To address pressure sores, UNMC had been
using the disposable egg crates and, in more serious cases, specialty
beds rented from KCI International Inc., San Antonio, Texas.

Last year UNMC spent $211,000 on specialty bed rentals, although
it received $35,000 back from KCI under an arrangement that
capped the hospital's expenditures at $176,000. Bradshaw said the
hospital developed new protocols for determining when a patient
needs a specialty bed and when the patient can be removed from the
bed, and what kinds of beds need to be used for specific cases. The
new protocols are expected to cut spending on bed rental by more
than half, to $60,000 to $80,000.

A second area of cost reduction was eliminating the use of egg crate
mattresses and geomats throughout the hospital, except for the labor
and delivery area. In 1995 the hospital spent $97,572 on the
disposable mattresses. The $78,600 it spent to buy the DeCube
mattresses will eliminate most of that annual expense, Bradshaw
said. "The tens of thousands of dollars we won't be spending on
egg crates easily justifies the DeCube purchase," he said.

The new mattresses have a high-density foam surface and a matrix
of removable sections that makes it possible to selectively treat
pressure ulcers. Besides the mattresses, the DeCube deal included
accessories like straps needed to hold the items on the bed.

UNMC considered putting out an RFP to a number of suppliers, but
decided to take advantage of a contract held by its group purchasing
organization, University HealthSystem Consortium, Oak Brook, Ill.
Bradshaw said clinicians and nurses who work with the mattresses
are enthusiastic about them, and UNMC didn't feel it was worth the
time or effort to solicit bids from numerous vendors.

SACRED HEART MEDICAL CENTER PUTS A NEW TWIST
ON CUTTING SUPPLY AND EQUIPMENT COST

At Sacred Heart Medical Center, Eugene, Ore., it's sort of a
capitated agreement, but with a twist.

Steve Howard, director of materials management for the 432-bed
hospital, was part of an employee task force searching for cost
savings in the hospital's $27 million to $30 million annual
purchasing budget for capital equipment and medical-surgical
supplies. Sacred Heart is part of Bellevue, Wash.-based
PeaceHealth, a not-for-profit organization sponsored by the Sisters
of St. Joseph of Peace, which owns five hospitals and manages
another 15.

Howard said instead of soliciting the lowest pricing from vendors
and cutting a sole- or dual-source agreement for items like
pacemakers and orthopedic implants, the hospital took a different
tack.

Looking at orthopedic implants, the task force gathered data from
IMS America Inc., Plymouth Meeting, Pa., reviewed its own
pricing levels and floated a traditional RFP on the devices. Based on
that information, the group set a cap on what it would pay for
various components. The caveat was that if a vendor didn't agree to
sell for the capped price, the hospital wouldn't use that vendor.

For example, on one top-of-the-line implant, Sacred Heart capped
the price at $4,400. Any of the hospital's surgeons could specify
which manufacturer they wanted to supply the device, but if that
supplier wouldn't agree to that price, the surgeon would have to find
another supplier. The orthopedic implant program, launched in
August 1995, is expected to save the hospital $300,000, Howard
said.

Sacred Heart next turned to pacemakers and applied the same
concept. Howard said the hospital developed a list of five vendors to
use for the pacemaker program, and approached each about it. They
were not happy with the concept, he said, and two didn't want to
operate under the new program--at least, not until they were told that
the physicians would stop specifying their brand of implant. Seeing
potential sales and profits evaporate brought them around, Howard
said.

The same procedure brought similar results to the cath lab. While
just a couple of years ago the hospital was paying $600 to $650 for
a PTCA catheter, Howard said, now the price is $400, and he
predicted that by the end of January it will be $300.

"We're in a situation where competition, not commitment, is the true
driver of price," Howard said. Instead of trying to force surgeons to
standardize on one manufacturer, and then trying to drive price as
low as possible with one manufacturer with a carrot-and-stick
approach, making both parties unhappy in the process, Howard
said, the new system allows marketplace competition to work.

Getting the cooperation of the physicians was key to the success of
the program. From the beginning the task force insisted on
involving physicians and giving them all the information they
needed or requested. Even when docs agree to standardize on one
supplier, there can still be residual resentment, Howard said. Now,
the physicians are free to choose their supplier, and it is up to the
supplier to decide whether it wants to sell devices for the capped
price.

"I don't know anyone who's ever been successful telling doctors
what to do," he said, "so we had to take a different approach."

The task force so far has reduced costs by nearly $2 million,
including $1 million in capital expenditures and $950,000 in annual
supply costs. A new contract for pacemakers saved more than
$300,000 of that $2 million, while standardizing cardiac catheter
procedures and ancillary products netted $125,000 in savings. An
additional $125,000 was saved from changes in heart valves and
other related supplies. Some of the capital savings included
$600,000 for new computer systems and $300,000 by reviewing
the purchase of a specialized camera for one of the medical center's
departments.

"These are all bottom-line rather than soft savings," Howard said.
He projected additional savings this year of $700,000 in med-surg
supplies and $300,000 in capital equipment.

HOAG HOPES NEW COMPUTED RADIOGRAPHY SYSTEM
DEVELOPS SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS

Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Newport Beach, Calif., is
installing a $1.5 million computed radiography system that the
hospital expects will produce significant savings.

The 416-bed facility is installing an Ektascan Imagelink(TM) Model
400 system manufactured by Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y.
The system is the first step in the hospital's plan to create a digital
imaging network to serve both inpatient and outpatient needs. The
gradual switch from film to digital imaging is part of Hoag's long-
term goal of storing all images and patient records digitally.

The first of three phases in the project calls for four completed
radiography systems to be operational by the spring of 1996. One
site will be at Hoag Health Center-Costa Mesa, about 10 miles from
the hospital. The other three sites will be in the hospital's intensive
care unit, critical care unit and emergency room.

Phases two and three call for more computed radiography systems
as well as the inclusion of CT and MRI images on the digital
network. The system will also interface with Hoag's radiology
information system, which stores patient information and exam
reports. When an image is retrieved for reference, the accompanying
report will appear on the screen as well.

No financial terms of the transaction were disclosed, and no
projections on savings were available.

ST. ALEXIUS WINS BAR CODING AWARD

St. Alexius Medical Center, Bismarck, N.D., was named the winner
of the 1995 Don Percival Award for its work in developing and
implementing bar code technology in the 313-bed hospital. The
award was presented in November at the annual SCAN-TECH
Exhibition and Conference in Chicago, the trade show of the
automatic data collection and identification industry.

St. Alexius instituted its bar code system in 1987 and has lowered
its materials management operational costs, increased productivity
and reduced inventory levels ("St. Alexius (N.D.) cuts inventory,
costs, recovers lost charges with bar coding," HMM, March 1994,
p. 5). The medical center has expanded bar coding across its entire
health care system, and virtually every major department now uses
some form of bar coding.

AS IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO WORRY ABOUT

Materials management executives in Kaiser Permanente's Northern
California region are facing an uneasy working relationship with
their staffs. The employees, members of Local 250 of the Health
Care Workers Union, voted in mid-November 1995 to reject a
Kaiser Northern California contract offer and authorize their
bargaining committee to call strikes of up to one day. The
negotiations affected about 200 materials management workers, part
of the larger 13,500-member union local.

A union spokesman said the contract with Kaiser expired in
October, and the employees have been working without a contract
since then. The spokesman said union members have not resorted to
disruptive tactics like work slowdowns, which could impair hospital
operations, but instead have relied on candlelight vigils, marches
and passing out leaflets. Relationships are strained, though, he said.

The spokesman said materials management executives and Kaiser
physicians have generally been sympathetic to union concerns, but
the feeling is not echoed by Kaiser top management. He predicted
that, since union and management are not close to agreement on
issues, union members will be working for a long time without a
contract. He said registered nurses at Kaiser have been working
without a contract for more than six months.

VHA SIGNS NEW PURCHASING CONTRACTS ON WIDE
RANGE OF MED-SURG PRODUCTS

In a flurry of year-end activity, VHA Inc., Irving, Texas, signed
purchasing contracts on a wide-ranging group of products. Sales
under the contracts have the potential of reaching nearly $160
million and saving member organizations as much as $21 million.
The contracts include:

+ Becton Dickinson Vascular Access (B-D), Sandy, Utah, for I.V.
start kits, catheters and safety products. VHA estimates the three-
year sole source contract, which took effect Nov. 1, 1995, will save
participating members between 6% and 8% annually on the
products. Discounts are on a sliding scale based on a member's
volume of purchases. Overall purchases by VHA members in 1995
are estimated to be $39.1 million, with $26 million of that on I.V.
catheters.

As part of the contract, B-D is offering a guaranteed savings plan for
members who convert their business to Vialon Insyte Catheters from
Teflon catheters. B-D cited its study showing Vialon Insyte
Catheters reduce I.V. restarts, reduce the incidence of phlebitis and
increase indwelling time. The company estimated that hospitals
using the Vialon products will reduce catheter use by nearly 5%.

To help hospitals defray conversion costs for switching, Becton
Dickinson agreed to rebate 3% of annual sales to an institution when
it converts to B-D's I.V. catheters.

The catheters, safety equipment and I.V. start kits will also be
marketed through VHA's private label program, VHA PLUS(R). B-
D will switch several versions of its I.V. start kits to the VHA
PLUS(R) program, offering savings of 5% to 10% on the products.
The agreement covers I.V. start kits with and without gloves,
bandages, transparent dressings and ointments. B-D estimated total
sales for those products to VHA members at $5.2 million in 1995.

+ Standard Textile, Cincinnati, for textiles and apparel. The contract
is a sole-source arrangement with Standard, a change from VHA's
previous dual-source contract that included Angelica Uniform
Group, St. Louis. VHA estimates the five-year contract, which
takes effect Jan. 1, will save participating members between $4
million and $9 million annually on purchases. Discounts are on a
sliding scale based on a member's volume of purchases. VHA
estimates overall purchases by members could total $50 million to
$70 million annually. The contract covers flat goods, reusable and
disposable apparel, surgical linens and incontinence products.

The contract includes direct discounts for each product segment and
discounts based on utilization levels, and adoption of Standard
Textile's linen management program.

Standard is one of seven manufacturers participating in VHA's
committed purchasing program. Members participating in the
committed program will receive additional discounts under the new
contract above those spelled out for other VHA members. VHA said
its surveys show that 79% of its members purchase products from
Standard Textile.

+ Bard Urological, Covington, Ga., adding urological specialty
items to the acute care products that have been covered under VHA's
contract with Bard since 1988. VHA estimates the five-year sole-
source contract, which took effect Jan. 1, will save participating
VHA members between $5.5 million and $9 million annually.
Discounts are on a sliding scale based on a member's volume of
purchases. VHA estimates overall purchases by members could total
$48 million annually.

The new contract includes a 19% discount from list price of the
acute care items and a 15% discount from list on the specialty items.
Members participating in the VHA committed program will receive
additional discounts under the new contract above those spelled out
for other VHA members.

Items covered under the contract include: acute care products--Foley
catheters, Foley catheter trays, drainage bags, urine meters, urethral
trays and midstreams; and specialty care products--stents, baskets,
balloons, urethrals, filiforms and urolase.

Bard controls 70% of the national market for acute care urological
products, and VHA said its surveys show that 81% of its members
purchase products from Bard. Bard is also one of VHA's seven
manufacturers participating in the group's committed purchasing
program.

+ In another move, VHA announced the signing of a dual-source
contract for the supply of electronic information related to
purchasing management. The move marks VHA's decision to stop
marketing its own software.

The contract is with Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill., and
Choice Medical Inc., Louisville, Ky. Abbott's offering, called
QUIK LINK, and support services will be offered free to VHA
organizations. Choice Medical's software, called ECHO, is being
offered at a discount.

VHA's in-house EDI packages are called VHA-Net COM and VHA-
Net CAP, and are used by 250 VHA members. Abbott's and
Choice's packages will be marketed primarily to those members. A
few VHA members now use Abbott or Choice software.

VHA said the advantages both products have over VHA's systems
is that users can transmit orders to more suppliers, and users can
add suppliers to the software more easily. Both programs also
support transactions using electronic data interchange (EDI).

on its products to the government as it did to other customers. The
Wall Street Journal reported that the VA purchased about $56
million of surgical devices from U.S. Surgical from 1989 to 1993,
but paid higher prices than it should have. The settlement ends a
dispute that the VA and U.S. Surgical have been discussing since

DEPT. OF DEFENSE AWARDS TWO PRIME VENDOR DEALS
TO OWENS & MINOR

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has awarded two medical-
surgical supply prime vendor contracts to Owens & Minor Inc.,
Richmond, Va. The two are worth about $22 million in the first
year.

The first award is for one year, with four one-year option periods,
and covers 12 DoD facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Florida. DoD estimates the value of the contract at $8 million the
first year and $76 million over five years. The contract takes effect
Jan. 15.

The second award is also for one year, with four one-year options.
It covers 22 facilities in Florida and Georgia. DoD estimates the
value of that contract at $14 million the first year and $91 million
over five years. The contract takes effect Jan. 8.

The DoD divides its $800 million of med-surg business into 21
regions. The two awards to Owens' means the distributor now
serves five of those 21 regions under a prime vendor arrangement.
The other three regions, with Owens' annual sales volume from
each, are: Lone Star region, covering Texas and Oklahoma--$27
million; National Capital region, covering the District of Columbia--
$21 million; and the Tidewater region, covering Virginia--$9.6
million.

Most of the supplies will be handled by traditional bulk distribution,
but a few facilities will operated under Owens' enhanced distribution
program.

SHARED SERVICES INKS CONTRACT FOR IOLS, PHACO
EQUIPMENT WITH CHIRON/IOLAB

Shared Services Healthcare Inc., Atlanta, signed a sole-source
contract for California intraocular lens manufacturer Chiron/Iolab's
full line of regular and specialty lenses, as well as kits and packs,
that is expected to generate significant purchases and savings for
SSH's 532 member facilities.

Pricing for the regular and specialty lenses is a sliding scale based
on commitment, with increasingly discounted pricing for higher
volumes to a commitment level of 75%. Facilities willing to commit
more than 75% of their annual volume can negotiate even better
pricing. Kits and packs are negotiated by each facility and also are
based on committed volume.

The contract covers ancillary products in addition to the lenses,
including Amvisc syringes and fluids. But perhaps the most enticing
addition to the offering is a separate contract for phacoemulsification
equipment. The surgical equipment is offered to SSH members at
significant price discounts from list, and includes phaco accessories
like remote control, tips and tubing. The equipment also is based on
a tiered pricing structure, but because it is a separate contract, it can
be accessed without having to commit to purchases of IOLs.

Anita Fredericks, director of SSH's purchasing program, said the
group anticipates high usage of both contracts because of what she
termed aggressive pricing by Chiron/Iolab.

Chiron has been aggressively pursuing market share in a soft market
dominated by a handful of manufacturers. The company is the
product of the $95 million buyout in early 1995 of Iolab Corp.,
Claremont, Calif., by Chiron Ophthalmics Inc., Irvine, Calif.
Respondents to HMM's IOL price survey ("IOL prices continue
sliding in the face of competition, vendor consolidation," HMM,
December 1995, p.1) reported continuing price declines in the prices
hospitals and group purchasing organizations are paying for IOLs.
They noted that prices are soft and manufacturers are willing to
consider price reductions. Without exception, respondents cited
competition as the major factor influencing IOL prices.

The contract took effect Dec. 1, 1995, and runs for two years.

SSH also awarded several other contracts recently:

+ Chemistry analyzers to Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick,
N.J., and Olympus America Inc., Lake Success, N.Y.

+ Urinalysis systems and immunoassay systems to Miles Inc.
Diagnostic Division, Tarrytown, N.Y.

+ Pathology and cytology equipment to Shandon Lipshaw,
Pittsburgh.

+ Bone densitometers to Lunar Corp., based in Madison, Wis.

AMERINET TO BUY CONSULTING FIRM KOWALSKI-
DICKOW ASSOCIATES

Group purchasing organization AmeriNet Inc., St. Louis, is buying
the Milwaukee-based health care consulting firm of Kowalski-
Dickow Associates.

Reliable sources told HMM the purchase was to close before the end
of December 1995, pending the outcome of due diligence
proceedings, although the sources said it is unlikely there will be
any hitches in the process.

No details on financial arrangements were available at press time,
and there were no indications of whether Kowalski-Dickow would
move its offices or staff to St. Louis.

Joseph Mulroy, president of AmeriNet, told HMM that the GPO and
Kowalski-Dickow have been discussing a deal, but that no decisions
have been made on the purchase. He said any further speculation
would be premature. Jamie Kowalski, president of Kowalski-
Dickow, was out of town and unavailable for comment.

Mulroy said the idea of adding a consulting service to AmeriNet's
operations is "just a new dimension for AmeriNet to assist members
to reduce supply costs and gain greater efficiencies in the use of their
products and staffing."

AMERINET ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS SIGNIFICANT
GAINS FOR GPO, IN SPITE OF LOSS OF MEMBERS FOR
VECTOR HEALTHSYSTEMS

AmeriNet Inc., St. Louis, posted another record year in 1995,
showing a 23.2% increase in contracted purchasing volume over
1994. That gain came at a time when Vector Healthsystems,
Providence, R.I., one of AmeriNet's three shareholder
organizations, incurred a 14% drop in member facilities,
representing a 22% drop in beds. AmeriNet also returned more than
$8 million to its members, up from 1994's $6 million.

Contracted purchases in fiscal year 1995 (ending Sept. 30) totaled
$2.76 billion, up 23.2% from 1994's $2.24 billion. Since its first
full year of business in 1987, when the company had contract sales
of $258 million, growth has been an astounding 1,070%.

ValuCare Still Growing

AmeriNet's ValuCare division, a segment that doesn't negotiate its
own agreements, but instead draws its sales figures from the
group's five other divisions on behalf of ValuCare, had contract
participation in fiscal year 1995 of $361 million, 9.1% higher than
last year's $331 million. While off the torrid pace of growth of the
previous year (1994 contracted sales were 42% higher than 1993's),
AmeriNet officials are still pleased with the division's performance.
They cite the fact that ValuCare represented 13% of AmeriNet's total
supplier contract sales volume in 1995.

Vector Membership Down

All of AmeriNet's value divisions performed well, in spite of the
fact that AmeriNet's largest shareholder organization, Vector
Healthsystems, suffered a significant drop in membership.
(AmeriNet's other two shareholder organizations--Intermountain
Health Care, Salt Lake City, and Hospital Shared Services,
Warrendale, Pa.--showed membership increases of 18.7% and
43.4%, respectively.) The number of Vector member facilities fell
by 262 to 1,603, a 14% drop from 1994's level of 1,865. The
number of beds those member facilities represented dropped an even
more precipitous 22.3%, or 36,356 beds, to settle at 126,378, down
from 1994's 162,734. AmeriNet's vice president of finance, Noel
Knobloch, explained that when the SupportHealth group of
hospitals joined AmeriNet through the Vector system, the hospitals
were guaranteed membership in AmeriNet through the end of 1994,
with the option of dropping out of AmeriNet then if they wanted. At
that time a number of hospitals opted out, and Vector's membership
numbers reflect the exodus.

The defections didn't hurt Vector's performance, though. In fact,
Vector showed the greatest gain in sales, jumping $298 million to
$1.13 billion in contracted purchases in 1995 from 1994's level of
$832 million, a 35.8% increase. Following next was Hospital
Shared Services (HSS), with $830 million in sales, a 20.6%
increase, and Intermountain Health Care (IHC), with $800 million
in sales, an 11.1% increase.

All Value Divisions Do Well

Each of AmeriNet's purchasing divisions performed well in 1995.
ValuHealth, the medical-surgical supply contracting division that
accounted for 40.7% of AmeriNet's total sales, posted revenues of
$1.1 billion, a 17.6% increase over 1994's $935 million.
ValuPharm, the pharmaceutical division contributing 34.8% of total
sales, rose by 28.9% in 1995 to $940 million, up 28.9% from
1994's $729 million.

Contract sales through ValuLab, the laboratory arm, increased
26.8% to $260 million from the previous year's $205 million.
ValuFood contract purchases rose 15.7% to $155 million, up from
1994's level of $134 million. ValuQuip capital equipment purchases
increased 27.6% to $250 million, up from the previous year's $196
million.

Membership Numbers Up

Membership numbers are also heartening to AmeriNet executives.
Even after factoring in the losses sustained by Vector, overall
membership was up. The number of member facilities increased 417
to 4,537, a 10.1% increase. ValuCare facilities accounted for 390 of
those 417 additional facilities, a whopping 93.5% of member
growth.

The total number of beds represented by new members, reflecting
both the SupportHealth losses and the nature of the alternate care
market, declined to 306,334, down 3% from 1994's 315,704 beds.
The number of member hospitals also increased in 1995, up 26 to
1,695, a slight 1.6% increase over 1994's level of 1,669. The
number of beds represented by hospital members declined 5.6% to
238,628 from 1994's 252,782.

PROVIDER CRITICISM OF MEDICAL-SURGICAL SUPPLY
DISTRIBUTORS IS BASED ON INCORRECT PERCEPTIONS
AND EXPECTATIONS

By Christopher M. Pancratz
Recently, articles in some trade journals have questioned the service
capabilities of medical-surgical distributors. While these articles
have focused on individual distributors, elements of the criticism
have industry overtones that are based on incorrect perceptions,
most particularly the perception that service levels can continue to
increase while the compensation for those services is reduced.

All service has a cost. When service expectations increase, costs
increase. To reduce cost in a service industry, unneeded and
unnecessary service levels must be identified and removed.

Service Expectations

The entire health care industry is focused on reducing cost and is
making great strides. Distributors of medical-surgical products to
hospitals have significantly reduced their operating expenses. To be
able to continue reducing costs while meeting needed levels of
service, providers and distributors together must set realistic
expectations that consider the volume of a product's usage and the
relative criticality of that product. It does not make sense to invest
scarce resources in attempting to have a fill rate of 98% or more and
six-hour delivery on infrequently used, noncritical products.

Manufacturers, too, need to be more involved in the service
equation. It is extremely difficult for distributors to provide the high
fill rates and short lead times included in today's contracts when
they must replenish from suppliers with 40% or 60% rates and
longer lead times. Additional cost reductions are being delayed
because the technology to drive them is dependent on the electronic
scanning of product information that has not yet been bar coded on
many manufacturers' packages.

One Size Still Doesn't Fit All

While many provider organizations and alliances are writing
multiregional and national contracts for distribution services,
individual local provider sites are asking for flexibility in services.
Proprietary organizations will, over time, be able to bring some
standardization to their systems. Today, however, most of these
facilities, along with those purchasing distribution services through
contracts negotiated by voluntary organizations, are asking
distributors to adapt contract specifications to local needs.
Distribution continues to be a predominantly local function, greatly
influenced by local demographics, transportation and attitudes.

Distribution capacity has shrunk. Recent industry consolidation has
reduced what many thought to be excess capacity from the system.
In a drive for system standardization, large consolidating provider
organizations have focused on a few national and multiregional
distributors, all of which are in the throes of their own
consolidations.

Local hospital materials managers may feel committed to the
agreement in place but know that these few distributors are not
always "the only game in town," as one recent article suggested.
Throughout the country, regional and local distributors are available
to provide backup or special services dictated by local needs. Many
of these distributors have the capabilities to provide all or most of
the services required by the local facility and the contracting
organization.

Value Of Distribution

Some large consolidated provider organizations, again focused on
standardized service, have discussed establishing their own
distribution capabilities. In such a consideration, it is important to
understand the basic functions performed by the distributor. Arthur
Andersen Consulting recently published The Value of Distribution in
the Medical Products Chain, which details these functions. Storage,
receiving, billing, credit and collection, customer service and
returns, transportation and information services are the basic
functions they list and detail. These are the functions that must be
performed by someone for product to be moved from where it is
manufactured to where it is used. Each of these functions involves
resources and costs.

It is important to determine who can perform these functions most
efficiently and economically.

Shared And Realistic Expectations

Service costs! If needed services are to be provided and costs
reduced, all supply chain partners must have shared and realistic
expectations of the service levels to be maintained. Manufacturers
need to continue to work to bring their service to a level that
supports the distributors' service levels to the provider. Providers
and distributors must insist that all products display an industry
standard bar code so investments in technology can bring the needed
return.

Provider groups and alliances need to permit and assist their local
member facilities to identify and utilize regional and local
distributors to supplement service requirements not covered in the
master agreement, or where additional capacity is required.

Providers need to identify their cost of performing basic distribution
functions without medical products distributors involved. Then
compare those costs with the distributors' cost to perform those
basic services.

Distributors have consistently been shown to be the most efficient
and economic source of these services. By working with these
distributors and their manufacturer partners to establish realistic
expectations of the service levels needed, providers ensure the level
of needed service at the best possible cost.

care and hospital market groups for the Health Industry Distributors
Assn. in Alexandria, Va.

IMS DRUG INDEXES CONTINUE SEVEN-QUARTER SLIDE

Hospital Materials Management's pharmaceutical price index
declined by 0.82% in this year's third quarter compared with the
overall index's second quarter 1995 showing. It was the seventh
consecutive quarterly overall pharmaceutical price decrease, but the
index is up 1.02% from the third quarter 1994 level. None of the
five indices registered a quarter-to-quarter price increase.

Psychotherapeutics led the falling prices, dropping 1.50% in the
third quarter. Like the overall index, it was the seventh straight price
decline for this category of medications. Following close behind
psychotherapeutics was the price decrease experienced by anti-
infective non-cephalosporins, which fell 1.38% in the third quarter
from the second quarter.

HMM obtains its indexes from IMS America Ltd., Plymouth
Meeting, Pa. This quarter's index is updated to a base period of the
third quarter 1994.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH PARES
$500,000 FROM ITS OPERATING ROOM MATERIALS AND
SUPPLIES BUDGET

The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Galveston,
Texas, has taken a knife to costs in its operating rooms and expects
to excise nearly $500,000 each year from materials and supplies for
operating rooms.

In late 1994 UTMB administrators launched an initiative designed to
significantly reduce costs systemwide at the 1,200-bed state teaching
hospital. To that end a joint committee of hospital staffers and
doctors from a physicians' practice plan associated with the hospital
evaluated high-frequency, high-cost operating categories. Task
forces were formed to evaluate 14 different categories, and materials
management personnel sat on 10 of the 14 task forces. The groups
were given eight weeks to present savings plans to the hospitals top
executives.

One of those areas was the operating room. In three meetings over
six weeks in early 1995, a hospital team of clinicians, materials
management executives (headed by Joe Velasquez, the hospital's
director of materials management) and hospital administrators
examined operating room procedures and established baseline
information on utilization and costs. The team, co-chaired by a
general surgeon and the hospital's executive director of nursing,
identified nearly $500,000 in projected annual savings. The savings
dropped the operating room medical-surgical materials budget to
$10.5 million per year, about a 5% savings.

Variety Of Areas Examined

Some decisions were straightforward, such as favoring the use of
nondisposable supplies over reusables, while others tackled more
potentially controversial issues such as the use of brown gloves vs.
white gloves.

UTMB has been standardized on gloves and sutures for several
years with Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., and Ethicon
Inc., Somerville, N.J., a division of J&J, so UTMB couldn't save
by renegotiating purchase contracts on the items. While UTMB is a
corporate partner with J&J, the items studied by the task force are
supplied under a J&J contract UTMB has with SunHealth Alliance
Inc., Charlotte, N.C. (UTMB's also uses University HealthSystem
Consortium, Oak Brook, Ill., for various group purchasing
contracts.)

Ethicon and J&J assisted in the hospital's cost saving efforts by
analyzing inventory levels, studying product utilization, examining
cases of product duplication or instances where two product codes
could be served adequately by one, and by revamping draping
procedures. In some cases the companies took back unused
inventory.

Where The Savings Are

A number of areas were identified for savings:

+ Sutures. The most significant savings are likely to come from
changes in procedures after a thorough evaluation of operating room
lines of sutures. Velasquez thinks making all the changes, a few of
which have yet to be initiated, will save close to $185,000 and drop
operating room annual expenses on sutures to $980,000. A waste
suture and material study revealed $80,000 in savings, and deleting
suture codes that are used infrequently or not at all saved another
$18,000. Ordering slow-moving sutures less frequently should cut
another $18,000 from the operating room budget, and deleting
redundant codes--or codes that can be switched for other codes with
no change in efficacy--saved another $5,000 per year. Making
changes in the use of dyed and undyed Vicryl sutures bumped
$11,000 out of the expense column, and changing from PS needles
to FS needles could save nearly $12,000. An additional $40,000 in
savings could be realized as the hospital begins resterilizing opened
but unused suture packs.

+ Instruments. Switching to reusable lap chole instruments can
produce significant savings, estimated at almost $125,000 per year.
Reviewing the contents of custom packs could mean an additional
$30,000 in savings, and changing vendors for hemostatic chemical
products could add another $39,000 in savings.

+ Changing draping procedures should produce $70,000 in annual
savings.

+ Limiting the availability of specialty gloves totes up another
$20,000 in annual savings.

Per Case Cost Drops

Results of the cost-cutting initiative have been significant.
Administrators say the hospital's cost per case has decreased,
although analysis of exact figures hadn't been determined at press
time. Virginia Opipare, UTMB's Hospitals Administrator, said the
results are significant, though. The hospital's cost per case has
decreased through enhanced efficiency and an overall reduction in
costs, she said. The hospital monitors projected budgets and prior
performances, and UTMB is beating both of those targets, she said.

Physicians were closely involved in the cost savings efforts, and for
good reason: In considering procedural changes in areas of
physician preference, a team that included doctors stood a much
better chance of making changes work, since the surgeons on the
team are responsible for carrying the task force's decisions back to
their peers. Dana Fox Jenkins, UTMB's director of clinical
continuous process improvement, said a cultural change like that
doesn't happen overnight. While many hospitals have a difficult
time getting physicians involved, they are an integral part of
UTMB's initiatives. They are key to controlling costs of operations
because they order and use the resources within the hospital, she
said, and when they're part of the decision-making process that
arrives at the outcome, it simplifies implementation of new
procedures.

To make the effort attractive for the docs, the hospital offers a
"gains-sharing plan" under which the hospital and the physicians'
practice plan share in the cost savings. No details on the agreement
were disclosed.

MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY CONTRACTS FOR FOURTH
STRAIGHT MONTH; PURCHASING MANAGERS'
NOVEMBER INDEX DRIFTS DOWN TO 46.5%

The nation's economy continued to be pulled in two directions in
November, with manufacturing contracting while the overall
economy grew weakly, said the nation's purchasing executives. The
Purchasing Managers' Index dropped in November to May 1995
levels, standing at 46.5%, down from October's 46.8%.

The latest figures supplied by the National Assn. of Purchasing
Management show indexes for Production and Employment down
in November from October levels, while New Orders, Backlogs of
Orders and Inventory indexes were up. Production fell in November
to 45.8% from October's 48.2%, while the Employment index
dipped to 44.1% from October's 45.2%. New Orders edged up to
50.1% from October's 48.1%, Order Backlogs rose to 41.5% from
October's 40.5% and Inventories jumped to 43.2% from 40.7% in
October.

The manufacturing sector showed overall weakness, with most
reporting categories declining. Only four of the 20 industries tracked
by NAPM reported improved performances in November over
October, compared to eight reporting an improvement in October
compared to September.

Analysis: Two selected unadjusted surgical and medical instruments
components of the Producer Price Index showed either no change or
a slight decrease in October, while two orthopedic appliance and
supply components increased.

The trend for the previous 12 months differed slightly, though, as
three of the four categories showed increases, while one--surgical

LARGE HOSPITALS AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS ARE
ASKING: ARE GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS
REALLY NECESSARY?

By William McFaul
With pressure mounting to reduce expenses, many larger hospitals
and recently formed integrated delivery networks (IDNs) have been
raising the question of whether or not participation in group
purchasing organizations offers real benefits. As cost pressures
continue to intensify and more IDNs form, the question will be
raised frequently: Can we do better on our own?

Frankly, in some instances high-volume purchasers can obtain better
pricing than most, if not all, GPOs, especially if they are able to
achieve a level of generic acceptability on physician preference items
like pacemakers, intraocular lenses and orthopedic implants. In
many instances they can match or beat most GPO contracts for I.V.
solutions, dressings, sutures and other items. Savings on
commodity items, however, are generally minimal and are usually
the result of the losing supplier attempting to undermine group
solidarity by shaving the group price.

Prices are tied to the profit levels of suppliers. Pricing in the health
care industry is related to volume and generic acceptability. One can
visualize pricing reduction as a balloon. If selected GPOs obtain the
very best prices they squeeze the balloon. Since suppliers must
maintain acceptable profit levels, the balloon expands at the other
end. Those GPOs that can deliver volume and commit to change will
fare much better in the long run than those that cannot.

When it comes to using a group purchasing organization, the real
issue should not be today's price on any given contract. If members
expect to realize substantial expense reductions beyond price alone,
the focus should be on the overall portfolio offered by the GPO, its
plans for the future, and the variety of truly beneficial services the
GPO provides.

Hospitals and IDNs would be well advised to ignore prompting
from consultants who have a vested interest in trying to develop
stand-alone volume purchasing processes. While these consultants
receive lucrative contracts and their clients realize short-term
savings, survival in managed care will depend on the hospital's or
IDN's ability to become high-quality, lowest-cost providers in their
areas. The most effective strategy to achieve long-term success in
pricing is to use volume purchasing by supporting a GPO and
finding one that offers long-term benefits.

Potentially, suppliers are another source of attempts to undermine
the GPO concept. While suppliers will not openly attempt to
undermine group purchasing for fear of reprisal from GPOs, we
cannot ignore the fact that group purchasing is to the supply industry
what unions are to management. Simply, suppliers stand to benefit
if group purchasing falters. Therefore, caution must be exercised
when suppliers attempt to break group cohesion or prevent
commitment.

High-volume hospitals and IDNs need to give the group purchasing
industry time to adjust to the rapid changes in health care.
Undoubtedly those facilities that "jump ship" will miss the rewards
when GPOs adjust their processes to obtain volume commitment,
create an environment for generic acceptability and devise a process
to reflect best pricing for their largest participants.

Price reductions are but one means of expense reduction. Today too
many hospitals and IDNs are focusing only on price and inventory
reductions. Far greater savings can be found by addressing
consumption, utilization, clinical path processes that cover all
aspects of expenses, consolidation of services and the development
of true shared services. The last two avenues for expense reduction,
consolidation of services and shared services, will yield enormous
benefits when GPOs evolve into facilitators for interfacing multiple
IDNs from contiguous service areas.

Real success in managing expenses will not come from short-term
gains in price reductions when far greater expense reductions are
available by redirecting energy into addressing the how, what,
where, when, why, who and how many of all expenses. The future
of price reductions depends on volume, commitment, and generic
acceptability. Support your GPO if you want to benefit from price
reductions. The major challenge for health care providers is the
development and implementation of a comprehensive plan to shift
away from merely managing materials and prices into the
management of all expenses.

William McFaul is the founder of and a principal in the Trenton,
N.J.,-based health care consulting firm of McFaul & Lyons Inc.

OWENS SHOULD OWN UP TO ITS PROBLEMS

To the Editor:
I read with unsympathetic interest a letter from Tom Sherry, vice
president of sales and marketing for Owens & Minor, in your
December 1995 issue.

Mr. Sherry's insinuation that they have valid reasons for their
performance slip is unacceptable. As a purchasing director, I cannot
tell my customer, the patient and nursing staff, "Sorry, the supplies
didn't arrive!" To add insult to injury, Mr. Sherry suggests that
Owens needs to "educate its customers based on product velocity
and criticality of product." Thanks, but no thanks. Sounds like
setting yourself up, and more excuses for future failures. Education
comes from someone who has and continues to understand what
they do!

Simply put, Owens & Minor messed up! Admit it and carry on. I
deal with companies that admit to mistakes and improve themselves.
