WARNERVISION ANNOUNCES BUYOUT PLANS

     As expected, WarnerVision Entertainment Pres. Stuart Hersch
will participate in buying company he founded as A*Vision
Entertainment in 1990.  Company announced agreement in principle
for Hong Kong-based Tiger Eye Investments Holdings to buy it from
Warner Music Group.  Deal is expected to close early this year.

     Executives couldn't be reached for comment over holiday
season, when WarnerVision was among many industry-related companies
taking week off.  However, news of Hersch's plans had been expected
for several months.  Fate of WarnerVision and Hersch had been in
question since executive shakeup began at Warner Music Group
earlier last year.  Sources had posed various scenarios -- Hersch
leaving company altogether or leaving Warner Music but taking
WarnerVision with him, as is occurring (VW Nov 6 p6).

     Although ownership is changing, WarnerVision won't sever its
distribution ties with Warner Music -- it has 4-year deal to be
distributed by WEA, sources say.  Name will be changed, though --
WarnerVision name, adopted less than year ago (VW Jan 16 p5), is
likely to revert to A*Vision, name with which company was founded
as affiliate of Warner's Atlantic Records.

     Price Tiger Eye will pay for WarnerVision is in $50-$70
million range, sources said.  Gross sales of WarnerVision, known
for its aggressive stance in acquiring nontheatrical properties,
are believed to be in $120-million range.  It has major share of
fitness video market and owns leading direct response fitness
equipment distribution company Fitness Quest, which it acquired in
1994.  It also distributes children's, music and other special
interest videos along with some direct-to-video movies.

     Tiger Eye Pres.-CEO Robert Book will become chmn. of new
company.  Tiger Eye specializes in acquiring media, publishing and
entertainment companies.  Hersch is expected to continue to run
WarnerVision.  Before founding it he was COO of King World
Productions, serving as key figure in taking company public.

     Time Warner won't lose much by selling WarnerVision, which it
still will distribute.  Although losing ownership of one video
company, Time Warner will gain others if pending merger with Turner
goes through.  Time Warner owns Warner Home Video and HBO Video
along with direct response specialist Time Life;  it will gain
Turner Home Entertainment and New Line.  

     Sale of WarnerVision comes after months of turmoil in
executive ranks of Warner Music Group that most recently resulted
in resignation of Michael Fuchs (VW Nov 20 p7).  Earlier ousters at
Warner Music included Doug Morris, who originally set Hersch up at
Atlantic and now is at MCA -- one of possible future homes that had
been rumored for WarnerVision.

LARGE VIDEO CHAINS GETTING BIGGER PIECE OF PIE

     Stores making up top 100 video chains now represent more than
25% of the more than 28,000 video specialty outlets in U.S.,
according to annual Top 100 report in Video Store Magazine.  Total
number of stores among top 100 chains for 1995 was 7,220 -- 24%
increase over 1994.  However, total revenue for top 100 amounted to
$4.06 billion, only 3% increase over $3.95 billion in 1994.

     Consolidation was main reason for increase in number of
stores, report said.  Acquisition-hungry newly public chains
swallowed many smaller chains that had made Top 100 in past,
leaving room for 24 chains to make list for first time.  Top 20
chains earned $3.65 billion -- up $15 million in year.  Increase
came despite overall decline in video rental business, which Video
Store documents as down 6% for retailers on industrywide basis from
1994.

     However, average Top 100 store grossed only $568,000 in 1995
-- off 16% from $679,000 in 1994.  Drop followed 3 consecutive
years of advances.  Report said decline is "more a result of the
swelling ranks of Top 100 retailers than anything else."  Increase
in total stores of 24% was far greater than any in history of
report since 1987.  Commenting on overall revenue gain of only 3%
for Top 100 chains, report said that "as chains grow, it takes a
while for new stores to come up to speed."

     Video revenue inched up 2% for Top 100 and ancillary revenue
5%, indicating growing importance of such products as snacks,
audiobooks, CD-ROMs, videogames, music, magazines, licensed
merchandise.  Biggest ancillary category, videogames, accounted for
9.8% of average Top 100 store's revenue -- up 4% despite overall
slump in 16-bit market.  Videogame rentals accounted for 8.3%,
sales 1.5%.  Sales and rentals of laserdiscs and CD-ROMs went up
slightly to 0.9% each from 0.8%;  food and drink sales were down
slightly to 0.7% from 0.8%.

     Percentage of average Top 100 store's revenue earned from
videocassette rentals actually increased slightly to 77% from 76.3% 
after several years of decline.  Only 8.3% of average Top 100
store's revenue came from video sellthrough, and almost half of
that was from previously viewed cassettes.  Total was down 10% from
preceding year's 9.3%.

     Blockbuster continued to dominate Top 100, although its power
was slightly diluted because of challenges from newly public
competitors and chains hoping to go public soon.  Blockbuster's
share of Top 100 revenue amounted to 62% in 1995, down from 67% in
1994, and its gross revenues for 1995 were $2.6 billion.  Company
had 3,350 domestic locations at year-end.

     Hollywood Video, which went public in 1993, exploded to 280
stores in 1995 from 97, increasing revenues to $165 million from
$73 million.  Movie Gallery, which made initial public offering
(IPO) in Aug. 1994, grew to 665 stores in 1995 including 90
franchisees, from 279, increasing revenue to almost $200 million
from $90 million.  Video Update, whose IPO was in July 1994, rose
to 250 stores from 45, growing revenue to $82.5 million from $26.9
million.  Moovies, only chain to complete IPO in 1995
(Aug.),expanded to 107 stores  from 11, with revenue soaring to $49
million from $5.5 million.

     Home Vision, which filed registration statement for IPO in
Oct. that has yet to hit market, increased its store count to 53
from 38 during year, with growing to $25.5 million from $18.8
million.  West Coast Entertainment, franchiser that was purchased
by smaller Giant Video in 1995, had about 500 franchised locations
throughout year, with revenues increasing to $195 million from
$183.6 million, report said, and plans IPO early this year. 
Roadrunner Video, which became public by merging with shell company
Business Data Group in July, maintained 53 stores throughout year
with annual revenues of $22 million.  First National Entertainment,
public company that originated as film distributor, purchased
25-store Video Tyme of Las Vegas, with annual revenue of $13.1
million.

     Top 10 chains accounted for 84.8% of Top 100 revenue -- $3.44
billion.  Preceding year's top 10 accounted for 83.2% of total.  Of
entire video specialty business, top 10 chains drew 39% of income,
up from 34% in 1994.  Top 10, ranked by 1995 gross revenue, were
(1) Blockbuster, (2) West Coast, (3) Hollywood, (4) Movie Gallery,
(5) Tower Records/Video, (6) Video Update, (7) Moovies, (8) Video
Connection (recently sold to Movie Gallery), (9) Palmer Video
(expected to be sold to West Coast), (10) Home Vision.

     Chain with most revenue per store was tiny 2-store Odyssey
Video of L.A. -- No. 82 on Top 100 list, its locations had average
rental revenue of $1.45 million.  Blockbuster Video stores averaged
highest amount of rental income -- $645,900 per store, down from
$826,300 in 1994.  Chain with highest sellthrough revenue per store
was RKO Warner Video, which ironically was forced into liquidation
at year-end despite almost doubling sellthrough income to $241,500
per store from $143,182 in 1994 (see separate item in this issue). 
Average Top 100 store earned only $37,776 from sellthrough in 1995.

     Lion's share of consumer dollars spent on video sellthrough
isn't claimed by video specialists.  Video Store puts total
industry retail revenue at $14.5 billion for 1995, $8.3 billion of
it spent in video specialty stores ($7.6 billion rental and only
$690 million sellthrough).  That leaves whopping $6.2 billion spent
in nonspecialty outlets, most of them sellthrough-oriented.  Top 10
stores of any type carrying video in N. America in 1995, according
to report:  (1) Blockbuster, (2) Suncoast Motion Picture Co. (410
stores, $280 million in video revenue), (3) Wal-Mart (2,189 stores,
$271 million in video revenue), (4) K mart (2,163 stores, $249
million), (5) merged Price Club/Costco (242 stores, $173 million),
(6) West Coast Video, (7) Wherehouse Entertainment (327 stores,
$155 million), (8) Sam's Club (433 stores, $141 million), (9)
Musicland/Sam Goody (869 stores, $139 million), (10) Hollywood
Video.

NOV. VCR SALES HIT RECORD, CENSUS TOPS 150 MILLION

     Our running count of VCR sales since inception in 1975 shows
cumulative total U.S. sales hit 150 million in Nov. after just over
20 years on market.  In other Nov. hardware news, EIA figures show
dealers' purchases of VCR and several other consumer electronics
products set records for month despite less-than-enthusiastic
estimates of holiday sales potential.

     TV/VCR combo sales showed biggest advance of all -- 49.1% --
but fell shy of record for month because of huge combo sales in
Nov. 1993.  VCR decks, achieving record, were up 23.5%.  VCR census
passed 150 million unit mark in 4th week of Nov., reaching
150,039,297 (VW Dec 11 p8).

     Here's how 1995 probably will go down in record books, based
on seasonal rates for first 11 months:  Direct-view color
(excluding combos), 23.56 million, down 4.8% from last year's
record 24.71 million.  Projection TV, 828,700, big 30.3% gain over
1994's record 636,177.  TV/VCR, 2,190,000, record 8.5% more than
1994's 2.02 million.  VCR decks, record at 13.71 million, 4.7% over
13.09 million last year.  Camcorders, 3.66 million, topping 1994
record of 3.21 million by 14%.

     Following is table of EIA figures on sales to dealers for
Nov.:

16-BIT VIDEOGAMES HOLD SHARE AMID NEW FORMAT BATTLES

     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold
onto major market share even this year as manufacturers wage war of
words, games and marketing dollars over high-powered new
technology.

     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William
(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64
would severely limit performance of system overall, and was like
"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."

     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. Vp
Peter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo's system to move
information from one part of machine to another.  Some portions of
Nintendo's machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that
will limit system's performance, Main and Nintendo engineers say
absolutely not.  What's clear is that such battles definitely will
wind up dominating media coverage and high-end game scene -- but
perhaps not dollar volume.

     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April
21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potential
launch dates ranging from May to Aug.  Some observers are betting
on spring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in
L.A.  If that's to be case, Nintendo is going to have to do some
fast advertising footwork.  In visit last week to Nintendo's
Redmond, Wash., hq, company told our affiliated publication
Consumer Multimedia Report that no ads had been placed in game fan
periodicals, even though deadlines are drawing near.  Another sign
that Ultra may come later rather than sooner:  Despite flying
half-dozen journalists to Redmond, Nintendo had only Ultra 64
videotape to show, not game itself.

     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogame
industry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great year
of confusion," Main said.  One big challenge:  Primary audience --
8-12-year-old boys -- is getting more choosy than ever before,
willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge in
performance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-olds
acting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," he said.  That's
resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo -- software sales have
been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, Virtual Boy,
is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" in both
U.S. and Japan.

     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winner
determined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  He
pointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and good
software product.  "Even while other software is selling at best
60-70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of
110-120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit market caught
Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market by surprise is
fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Main predicted 16-bit
strength would continue to lesser degree through 1996.  "At this
time next year [16-bit] is going to represent 35-40% of the
videogame market," he said.

     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame market
isn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market would
be down anywhere from 5-6% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total
decline will come to 10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at
$3.8-$3.9 million.  Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3
of that, he said.  Market share of 16-bit games declined to 66% of
total sales in 1995 to 77% in 1994.  Hand-held market share also
slumped, to 15-16% from 25%.  That still represents some
significant volume, though.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold,"
Main said.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."

     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,
account for only fraction of total market, about 19%, Main said. 
He estimated that fewer than one million units of 32-bit consoles
sold.  Of that number, Sony's Playstation accounted for
400,000-500,000, Sega's Saturn for 200,000 and 3DO for 150,000,
with Atari's Jaguar and other devices accounting for rest.  By
contrast, 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment system sold 2.4
million units, he said.  Virtual Boy's sales were far under
expectations, Main admitted.  "It's been a long year for Virtual
Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playing units have sold far
under expectations, "we are not finished with Virtual Boy," he
said.

     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S. and 250,000 in
Japan, Main said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface of
its unique capabilities, he said.  In Japan, "they are planning to
relaunch the product in February," he said, with similar relaunch
set for U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It is going to
have another round."

     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROM games. 
Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefit manufacturers, not
consumers, Main said.  When it comes to adding bulk memory capacity
to Ultra 64, Nintendo is going to stick with recordable magnetic
disc that company already has announced, he said.  Disc will move
at 8 times CD-ROM speed.  Position may leave Nintendo vulnerable
when DVD hits market, since competing M-2 and Sony PlayStation
systems reportedly will be able to play back DVD discs with
relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are that Ultra 64, with its
proprietary magnetic discs, won't have that capability.

     Rental prebook record was shattered twice in 1995.  Fox last
month reported orders of 735,000 copies of Die Hard with a
Vengeance in N. America, including revenue sharing and not
including laserdisc and direct mail.  Film released on video Dec.
19 grossed $100 million at box office.  Buena Vista earlier
reported 715,000-piece order for Pulp Fiction, highest total since
LIVE released Terminator 2 (VW Sept 4 p5).  Both Die Hard 3 and
Pulp Fiction prebooked during period when retailers overall were
experiencing downturn in rental business.  Record numbers reflect
fact that video business is becoming increasingly hit-driven, with
top titles dominating while other categories suffer.  Figures also
attest to growing importance of revenue sharing, with Rentrak now
servicing many top chains;  both Fox and Buena Vista, which have
contracts with Rentrak, are benefiting from increased orders for
their titles from Rentrak by settling for less money upfront while
awaiting share of retailers' income from rentals.

     Commenting on 3M's leaving videotape manufacturing business,
TDK Mktg. Vp Tim Sullivan warned retailers to beware of
"nonmanufacturing tape suppliers who will seize the opportunity to
build market share by cutting prices."  Buying from such suppliers
could be "penny wise and pound foolish," he said, because 3M's
departure could create supply shortage, leaving those suppliers
with inadequate quantities.  With demand high for blank and pancake
tape, "suppliers who lack the capacity to manufacture their own
product will not be able to service their retail customers with
sufficient quantities of tape," Sullivan said.
