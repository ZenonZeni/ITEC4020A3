<h4>Intelligent Control is a good solution to underwater robotics
problems</h4>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><font size="3">Underwater vehicles are
        conceived for operation in an unstructured environment
        and have to cope with typically poor sensor information
        and unpredictable events. While the traditional approach
        to performing complex tasks in these conditions is
        tele-operation, research is now oriented towards
        increasing autonomy to reduce human control, even in
        conditions of increasing uncertainty.</font></td>

        <td><font size="3">This can be done either by improving
        sensor technology to increase knowledge of system status
        or by increasing system intelligence, i.e. the ability to
        act in an uncertain environment in such way as to raise
        the probability of successful command execution. A
        particularly suitable approach that overcomes the present
        limitations of sensor technology is a hierarchical
        control architecture based on the principle of
        &#145;Increasing Precision - Decreasing Intelligence'. A
        three-level hierarchical control architecture has been
        adopted on some of the latest UUVs (Vortex, NPS PHOENIX,
        MARIUS).</font></td>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><font size="3">The upper level, called
        Organization/Mission/Strategic Level, answers the
        question: &quot;What sequence of activities must the
        robot perform to execute commands given by the user?&quot;.
        This module plans the mission off-line according to user
        requirements. When working on line, the Organizer can
        decide whether the mission should be aborted or replanned
        according to information about detection of malfunction
        or deviations from the nominal plan.The medium level is
        called Coordination/Control-Task/Tactical Level and
        answers the question: &quot;How can activities specified
        by the Organization Level be performed?&quot;. It schedules
        the specific tasks which are needed to perform the
        activity specified by the Organizer, chooses the
        &quot;best&quot; algorithm for carrying out each task,
        synchronizes tasks and allocates the necessary
        resources.The lower level, named Execution/Servo-control
        Level, performs direct sensing and actuation. This level
        is subject to severe time constraints, and for this
        reason its algorithms are synchronous. However, the
        Coordination Level can at any time detect an event based
        on data received from the Execution Level. In brief, the
        Coordination Level is the interface between the world of
        asynchronous event-driven decisions (AI) and synchronous
        continuous control.</font></td>

systems</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Each control level performs activities which
are different in qualitative terms and for this reason need to be implemented
in different languages. The Organization Level performs functions
typical of Artificial Intelligence: computation is purely
symbolic and contains mission/doctrine specifications. The Prolog
language may be particularly suitable for implementing the
Organizer (NPS PHOENIX). The Coordination Level manages task
scheduling and synchronization and consists of object modules
which communicate via messages. It could be implemented using a programming
language that supports concurrency such as ADA. Conversely, the
Coordination Level can be based on a C++ object-oriented
implementation and concurrency is managed by Basic OS, supplied
by VxWorksTM (ROMEO). The Execution Level will be written in C++
with the implementation of objects which define not only sensor
management and filtering, but also the control algorithms.
Software implementation will be carried out according to Object
Oriented programming.</font></p>
