Transport and communications
</H1>
</P>

Victoria, and Melbourne in particular, is a transport and communications hub 
for Australia. To maintain Victoria's competitive edge, the Victorian Government 
is committed to measures that will improve performance and reduce costs to 
transport users.
<P>
<B><I>Road transport</B></I>
<P>
A network of modern arterial roads and freeways connects metropolitan Melbourne 
with regional and interstate centres, providing fast, cost-effective transport 
for goods and people within the State and beyond. Major projects such as the 
proposed City Link project are constantly maintaining and upgrading the 
network in urban and rural areas.
<P>
Road freight is a world best practice support service in Victoria, with 110,000 
trucks moving some 250 million tonnes of freight annually. Victorians have 
a high level of car ownership, reflecting high living standards and easy road 
access to work, shopping and recreational centres throughout the State.
<P>
<B><I>Air services</B></I>
<P>
Melbourne International Airport at Tullamarine is a major gateway to domestic 
and international destinations. The airport is just 22 kilometres from the 
centre of Melbourne. It operates 24 hours, seven days per week, and has the 
capacity for expansion to meet foreseeable demand until well into the next 
century. 
<P>
Melbourne International Airport is served by 42 international 
carriers and eight domestic carriers which transported some 11.1 million 
passengers in 1993-94. The airport is also a major freight port with 327,000 
tonnes of cargo moved each year, reflecting the importance of air transport to 
Australia's international and domestic trade.
<P>
A $247 million redevelopment program for Melbournes Airports international 
terminal is currently being undertaken, with Stage 2 due for completion by 
December 1995. The redevelopment includes the creation of significant new 
retailing facilities, the doubling of the international terminal handling 
capacity, and expansion of the number of international aircraft gate positions, 
customs and immigration counters, baggage reclaim carousels and check-in 
counters. There will also be a $55 million car park redevelopment with the 
construction of a multi-level car park expanding the current capacity of 1800 
to 3200 spaces.
<P>
An area of 13 hectares of land close to the existing freight terminals has 
been set aside for the development of new world class freight handling 
facilities, designed to position Melbourne as a major freight airport in the 
south-west Pacific region. Freight tonnage is projected to increase from its 
current annual level of 327,000 tonnes to 311,000 tonnes by 2000.
<P>
Victorian airport services range from modern regional airports with full 
navigation facilities to minor airfields on the outskirts of most country 
towns. Daily scheduled services connect Melbourne with major centres in the 
more distant parts of the State, particularly in the west and north-west. In 
addition to its major airport, Melbourne is served by three other airfields, 
catering for general and specialist aviation services.
<P>
<B><I>Shipping</B></I>
<P>
The Port of Melbourne is Australasia's largest container and general cargo 
port. Operating 24 hours a day, it handles 40% of Australia's overseas 
container trade, almost double the volume of containers handled in Adelaide, 
Brisbane and Fremantle combined. In 1993-94 it handled 802,552 TEUs.
<P>
There has been major structural change on the Melbourne waterfront in recent 
years. Today, most port services such as pilotage, towage, stevedoring, 
storage and transport are operated by private enterprise.
<P>
The Port of Melbourne has 41 berths for commercial shipping. The port also 
offers multi-purpose berths which handle a full range of cargoes, from timber 
to motor vehicles, and specialised berths for dry cargoes, including cement, 
briquettes, sugar, soda ash and sulphur, and facilities for handling many 
liquid cargoes, from molasses to petrochemicals, using the latest bulk handling 
techniques.
<P>
Back up support services are located either adjacent to, or within, the port 
area, and in variety and convenience are unmatched by any other Australian 
port. Melbourne's container parks are adjacent to berths and the port is also 
served by a large number of specialist support companies. As well as cool 
stores and empty container storage, services include delivery, cleaning, 
repair and maintenance, pre-tripping of reefer containers and road/rail 
transfer.
<P>
Container handling rates at the port are among the most competitive in 
Australia and better than in many overseas ports. Truck queuing has virtually 
been eliminated and turnaround times have been reduced by approximately 50%.
<P>
Melbourne offers shippers the advantage of close proximity to 70% of 
Australia's population. This ensures a favourable balance of imports and 
exports and guarantees the most efficient cargo exchanges in Australia.
<P>
Proximity to the National Rail Corporation's Melbourne Freight Terminal at South 
Dynon is an additional advantage. The major upgrading of the terminal and the 
construction of a direct road link between Swanson Dock and the rail freight 
terminal provides for significant savings in the transfer of containers 
between the port and rail network.
<P>
The port has also attracted private investment. The two private terminal 
operators at Swanson Dock (Patricks and Conaust) are committed to developing 
their facilities to operate at international best practice performance levels. 
Major investment for redevelopment of these terminals over the next 20 years 
will exceed $300 million.
<P>
<I>Victoria's other cargo ports</I>
<P>
The Port of Hastings, a natural deepwater harbour 65 kilometres south-east of 
Melbourne on Westernport Bay, specialises in bulk handling of oil, steel and 
gases.
<P>
The Port of Geelong, on the western side of Port Phillip Bay, 65 kilometres 
south-west of Melbourne, handles grain, petroleum products and general 
industrial goods.
<P>
The Port of Portland, 350 kilometres south-west of Melbourne, is a deepwater 
harbour used for exporting grain, live sheep and woodchips. It also serves a 
major aluminium smelter commissioned at Portland in 1990.
<P>
<B><I>Rail Freight</B></I>
<P>
Melbourne is linked by high speed rail services to all major industrial centres 
in Victoria and other mainland States.
<P>
About 70% of long-haul rail traffic is containerised. Container handling in 
Melbourne is centralised at a modern rail terminal and intermodal interchange 
adjacent to the Port of Melbourne and the central business district.
<P>
Costs of privately owned container movements by rail from Melbourne to major 
centres interstate are as follows:

<P>
Costs of road haulage to and from the railhead are additional.
<P>
<B><I>Postal and light freight services</B></I>
<P>
The national postal service is operated by Australia Post which is 
headquartered in Melbourne. Australia Post provides a full range of letter and 
parcel services to all parts of Australia, including remote areas. Urban areas 
receive deliveries every working day, and twice daily (Monday to Friday) 
within the central business district of Melbourne. 
<P>
The cost of sending mail in Australia is among the lowest in the world with 
the domestic basic postage cost of 45 cents. Australia Post's domestic letter 
service provides customers with world-leading value for money. The letter 
service is faster, more reliable and more affordable than the leading postal 
service in the USA, UK, Canada, France, Sweden and the Netherlands.
<P>
Australia's international mail rates for all classes of mail are also very 
competitively priced. For example, a standard airmail letter from Australia to 
Germany costs $1.20, whereas from Japan to Germany the equivalent item costs 
$2.70. Australia Post has an extensive international network and worldwide 
affiliations. In addition to standard rates of postage, Australia Post will 
negotiate substantial discounts for bulk mail and frequent large consignments, 
including publications.
<P>
Intense competition in the courier and light freight markets has led to a 
proliferation of cost-effective services across Australia and to other 
countries. The world's major light freight operators, including TNT and the 
US-based United Parcel Service, operate in Australia and offer competitive 
services.
<P>
<B><I>Telecommunications</B></I>
<P>
Driven by the needs of a dispersed population on a large continent, which 
requires reliable and efficient international and domestic communications 
links, Australia has developed a telecommunications infrastructure the equal 
of any in the world.
<P>
The domestic and international telecommunications carrier, Telstra 
Corporation, provides a comprehensive range of services including direct dial, 
packet switching, an integrated digital network, the cellular mobile, 
voice/data PABX, videotext and satellite services. Telstra is playing a 
leading role in the introduction of revolutionary services based on an 
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and optical fibre links.
<P>
The telecommunications industry in Australia has been deregulated, and the 
increased competition will provide even greater stimulus for the provision 
of innovative and cost-effective services based on new technology.
<P>
The second telecommunications carrier, Optus Communications, offers national 
and international long distance services and both analog and GSM cellular 
mobile services as well as a range of other business services. A third mobile 
carrier, Vodafone, also offers GSM digital mobile services.
