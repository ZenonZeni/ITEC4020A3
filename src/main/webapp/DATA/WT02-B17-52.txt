<B>International Marine Biotechnology Culture Collection</B>
<P>
The <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HNEI/hnei.html">University of 
Hawaii</a> is now home to a unique collection of approximately 2400 
tropical and subtropical marine photosynthetic microorganisms and 
enriched systems.  This 
collection represents a lifetime of work done by the late Akira Mitsui of 
the University of Miami, a graduate of the University of Tokyo.  The U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) and the Japan Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry, in recognition of the importance of this resource, are 
providing the initial funding to maintain the collection in Hawaii.
<P>
The collection was established as an international marine biological 
repository for 
research, development, data collection, and information sharing.  It 
should help to stimulate new, multinational industries in biotechnology 
and provide a fundamental base for worldwide 
cooperation in solar hydrogen production and sustainable energy systems.
<P>
The initial transfer of 360 cyanobacteria and 160 other photosynthetic 
bacteria from the 
University of Miami to the University of Hawaii was successfully 
completed in September 1995.  The dedication of the new International 
Marine Biotechnology Culture Collection took place on September 27, 1995, 
with dignitaries from DOE and the Japan Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry in attendance.

An inventory of all of the purple nonsulfur bacteria and the 
cyanobacteria

cultures (the triplicate import set of test tubes and vials and

the sets that have subsequently been subcultured from the imported

set) was done to check for viability.  For the cyanobacteria,

145 strains are viable and the majority exhibit visibly increasing

biomass.  For the purple nonsulfur bacteria, of the 462 strains

listed for importation on the import permit, 408 were actually

imported.  If these, 394 survived the importation and all were

transferred.  Of the 394, there are at present 355 that are still

viable with visibly healthy cells.  Documentation of all strains

transferred and growth conditions has been recorded on an Excel

database.  Conditions on these organisms are now being optimized

to promote increased growth rates.  The same technique as that

for the cyanobacteria is being used:  larger inoculum-to-media

ratio (decrease lag phase).  Also, higher light and temperature

are being added.  The aSy medium has been used with selected cultures

under high light, and the growth response has been positive.
