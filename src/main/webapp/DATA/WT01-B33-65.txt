<h2>The Drug Legalization Debate: What's the Real Issue? </h2>

<p><b>By Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>This document attempts to define the real areas of agreement
and disagreement between those who support the war on drugs, and
those who do not. The statements I make below about the beliefs
of the respective sides are based on my personal experience with
talking and debating with literally thousands of people over the
last several years. While the opinions I give below will vary
from person to person, they hold true for the vast majority of
people I have encountered on each side. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Why I wrote this. </h3>

<p>Debates about drug policy can get to be pretty complicated
pretty quickly. Some of the reasons for this are obvious - drug
abuse is a problem with many causes and effects throughout
society. It would be perfectly easy to get involved in discussing
the details of one aspect of the drug problem and to lose sight
of the problem as a whole. </p>

<p>Also, I have noticed a consistent tendency among supporters of
the drug war to be confused about the real issues. For example,
they often tend to assume that anyone who supports drug policy
reform must be a drug user, or someone who favors or wants to
promote the use of drugs. This, of course, is not the case at
all. Many of the supporters of reform are people who have never
used illegal drugs and have no intention of using them. Or they
tend to ask things like &quot;Why do you want to make more crack
babies?&quot; The truth is that no one in their right mind wants
to see more crack babies and those who support reform do so
because they believe that better policies could reduce the number
of crack babies. </p>

<p>In this document I will attempt to summarize the various
facets of our approach to drug policy and define where there
seems to be agreement or disagreement between those who support
reform, and those who support the drug war. </p>

<h3>Is drug use immoral? </h3>

<p>Opinion varies on both sides, although drug war supporters are
clearly more likely to feel that drug use is intrinsically
immoral. But there are also people on the side of reform who have
essentially the same feelings about drug use. </p>

<p>That is, many supporters of reform (&quot;legalization&quot;)
do not approve of drug use or abuse in any way and even feel that
it is &quot;immoral&quot;. </p>

<h3>Are drugs dangerous? </h3>

<p>Both sides agree that drugs can be dangerous to some people.
Supporters of reform will point out that the legal drugs are more
dangerous than the illegal drugs, so the laws don't relate to
this argument anyway. </p>

<p>Supporters of the drug war seem to make the illogical leap
that because drugs are dangerous or immoral, therefore the best
approach to the problem is to throw people in prison. This, of
course, is illogical. There are lots of problems in society which
are either dangerous and/or immoral, but that doesn't mean that
prison is the best solution to all of them. </p>

<h3>Should we have more treatment? </h3>

<p>Both sides seem to agree that there should be more and better
drug treatment. </p>

<h3>Should we have more education? </h3>

<p>Both sides seem to agree that there should be more and better
education on drugs. </p>

<h3>Should we have better prevention efforts? </h3>

<p>Both sides seem to agree that we should have more and better
efforts to prevent people from becoming involved with drugs in
the first place. (As long as &quot;prevention&quot; does not
include criminal punishment.) </p>

<h3>What about the medical uses? </h3>

<p>For recognized medicines, such as morphine, both sides agree
that doctors should be free to prescribe it where necessary. The
supporters of the drug war generally don't seem to recognize or
understand why it is not being prescribed where necessary. </p>

<p>For marijuana, the supporters of the drug war are of mixed
opinion. Some support the medical use of marijuana, or at least
see the futility in persecuting people who are sick, even if it
wasn't good for them. Others, the more extreme drug warriors,
maintain that marijuana has no medical uses at all, or that other
drugs would do better. </p>

<h3>Criminal Punishment </h3>

<p>This is the only area where there is clear and consistent
disagreement between the two sides. </p>

<p>Supporters of the drug war tend to feel that some drugs ought
to be illegal (people ought to be put in jail), in order to
discourage use, or to express society's disapproval. </p>

<p>Supporters of reform say that criminal penalties for private
drug possession and use are senseless and destructive. </p>
