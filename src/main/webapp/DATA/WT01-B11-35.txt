<P> The 71 Lynx Wankel was 296 pounds (dry?).  They have little
suspension travel, perhaps 3 inches.

<BLOCKQUOTE> Arctic Cat had at least two different rotary engines in
several different models.  First there was the 303.  This engine was
used until '74, I believe, and after that they used the 295.  Both
engines were made by Sachs.  The rotaries could be found in Panthers
(naturally, what engine couldn't?) and Cheetahs and probably others such
as the Puma.  I had a 75 Cheetah with the 295 and there were a few
things to look out for.  One, the recoil needed to be well greased at
all times.  There was a zerk fitting on the top for this purpose.  If it
wasn't lubricated the recoil had a tendency to self destruct.  Since the
fuel pump is *mechanical* on the 295 and driven by an eccentric on the
end of the crankshaft which sticks through the recoil the recoils are
difficult to find.  Two, the fuel pump.  If the eccentric bearing went
bad the end of the fuel pump push rod would get worn away and soon there
would be no fuel getting pumped.  Both of these problems are easy to
avoid with a little maintenance but would definitely be something to
look for if you were to buy one of these machines.  My Cheetah had a
boatload of torque and was great for a work sled.  Oh yeah, belts can be
kind of hard to find, too, because no one has the correct one listed for
that application and if you do have to replace a recoil or fuel pump
they were about $70 used 7 or 8 years ago.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE> OMC put 500cc rotaries in both Johnson and Evinrude
snowmobiles. They were very large sleds, but had electric start and
reverse to make them a little easier to live with.  These engines came
in two flavors, 35 and 45 horsepower.  I haven't heard much about the
35s but the 45s had some trouble with the shaft of the secondary
throttle plate breaking and allowing the plate into the engine thus
destroying the rotor housing.  I know two people that seem to have a
morbid fascination with these things and have at least half a dozen of
them between the two.  Most of them are just used for parts, however, as
only two of the 6 or so sleds are in running shape, so that says
something about the OMCs I would say.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
