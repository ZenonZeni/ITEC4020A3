100-YEAR ISSUE FROM MALAYSIA

Tenaga Nasional Berhad's proposed 100-year issue via the 144A market
has been rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service.
      Tenaga, which plans to issue $150 million of the notes, is the
dominant producer of electricity in Peninsule Malaysia with approximately
80% of the total market. It is 78% owned by the Malaysian government.

NEW YORK CITY PLANS TO SECURITIZE TAX LIENS

The nascent movement among municipalities to securitize delinquent
property taxes took a major step forward last week when New York City
stepped into the fray, requesting proposals from investment banks on how
best to securitize $200 million to $250 million of tax liens. It would be
the biggest such securitization ever.
     The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrears
totaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; and
it is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the senior
notes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.
     Although the document states that an objective is to complete the
transaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "pretty
tight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completion
of any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment of
pending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is the
city's advisor.
     A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pending
legislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city as
the lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes when
someone falls behind on their property taxes. The proposed issue will be
backed by the better-quality of these tax liens, mostly commercial real
estate with a high likelihood of repayment.
     One of the basic principles behind these transactions is that the
pooled tax liens will eventually generate cash in one of three ways: the
property owner will pay the back taxes, the bank will foreclose and pay the
back taxes, or the municipality will itself foreclose and sell the
property.
     According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizations
will accomplish four things: to increase the cashflow from delinquent tax
liens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;
increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need for
the city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.
     "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficient
method to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure process
the City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restore
fairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improve
collection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieve
upward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term sale
program will be the initial securitization," the request for proposal
states.
     The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike a
traditional private placement, the issue will be fully underwritten by the
investment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-
efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital will
be funneled into the city's operations fund.
     The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was last
Friday, and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about two
weeks.
     Which underwriters the city will choose is anyone's guess, but one
question in the document does ask bankers to describe their experience
implementing new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list of
those with specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.
     Most recent was Smith Barney, which priced a $19 million issue for the
City of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. The issue has a two-year average,
seven-year final life, priced at 220 basis points off the curve, and had
$25 million of collateral. Fitch Investors Service rated it BBB and The
Principal Finance Group scooped up the entire offering.
     New Haven sold its liens into a trust, which then issued the taxable
notes. There will be no recourse to New Haven and in this way is similar to
a deal in the fall of 1994 from Jersey City, N.J., which was agented by CS
First Boston.
     Other tax lien deals are due to follow soon. Breen Capital Group is
about to launch a $50 million securitization backed by a diverse pool of
tax liens, culled from its own portfolio. The deal, which will be placed by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is currently structured with a four-year final,
two-year average life. The deal will likely be overcollateralized.
     Price talk has not been heard yet, but because the portfolio is "hand-
picked" and will not carry the concentration risk of a single-city deal,
BZW will aim for a tighter spread than New Haven, a source said. Both Fitch
and Standard & Poor's are expected to rate the transaction.
     Meanwhile, Philadelphia is expected to make its securitization plans
public soon. The city is rumored to be planning a $150 million issue.

ELKEM FROM LAND OF REINDEER

Barclays de Zoete Wedd was roadshowing a $60 million issue last week
for Elkem A/S, a Norwegian metals company with sales last year of
approximately $1.4 billion.
     The company, considered a mid-BBB, is reportedly looking for 10- of
12-year money in the form of senior unsecured notes. Price talk was 130
over Treasurys. Bids were expected this week.
     One investor expressed concern about the company's cyclicality, noting
that Elkem is coming off its best earnings in six or seven years. "I think
it's on the fence between an NAIC-2 and 3," the investor said.
     Last fall ABN-AMRO brought a $20 million deal from Elkem's U.S.
subsidiary. Those senior notes, considered an NAIC-2, had a 10-year final,
seven-year average life and priced at 125 off the curve.
     Elkem is one of Norway's largest companies and a worldwide leader in
the production of silicon metals and aluminum, to name a few.

IFC-LINKED DEALS MAKE ROUNDS

Chase Securities is in the market with a $200 million issue from
Edelsur, an Argentine gas utility. The deal would be just the third under a
new program by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank.
     The deal comes on the heels of another IFC-linked deal. Just before
Christmas, J.P. Morgan and ING Securities placed a $100 million issue with
institutional investors for Grupo Industrial Bimbo, S.A. (Gibsa), which
owns a popular Mexican bread sold under the brand name Bimbo (PPR Nov. 13,
p. 1).
     Under the program, the IFC extends a loan to the company and keeps a
small portion for its own account. It then sells the remainder to a
Delaware trust in form of participation interests subsequently issued to
investors.
     As a division of the World Bank, the IFC can ensure certain payment
guarantees that generally yield an investment grade rating.
     Details about the Edelsur deal were sketchy at press time, but sources
said it was apparently divided into floating- and fixed-rated tranches that
would be filled out according to demand. Price talk was reportedly Libor
plus 200 for the floater and the equivalent spread for the fixed.
     On the Gibsa transaction, more details were available. The 10-year
bullet priced at 305 off the curve and was popularly referred to by
investors as the Bimbo deal. The structure did evolve somewhat since it
first hit the market mid-November. At that time it had a 12-year final,
seven-year average life and the notes were being talked at 275 to 285 off
the curve.
     Gibsa, with sales last year of $1.25 billion, was founded in 1945 and
makes such products as breads, cakes, potato chips, and tortilla chips,
among others. Besides a 90% market share in much of Mexico, the company has
plants in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador. It has also started
to make some acquisitions in the U.S. tortilla market.
     A source pointed out that the company's distribution network is so
extensive and well respected that Gibsa currently has a distribution
agreement with Mars, and until recently also had one with Wrigley's.
     The new program is part of the IFC's attempt to tap the U.S.
institutional market -- such as insurance companies and pension funds.

ABN-AMRO PAVES WAY FOR ROGERS

ABN-AMRO recently found circles for a $25 million issue from Rogers
Group, one of the largest aggregate companies in the nation. The materials
it produces are used in road construction.
     The issue from the Nashville-based company was four times
oversubscribed and purchased by three investors. The issuer decided not to
expand the offering, which was divided into two tranches, 10-year and 20-
year bullets.
     Although no pricing was available, initial price talk was 110 to 120
over the 12-year Treasury.

AIRBUS CIRCLES MARKET

Salomon Brothers was in the market last week with a $52 million issue
from Airbus Industrie, sources said.
     The secured loan certificates were reportedly broken into two
tranches, a 17-year final, 11-year average life with price talk at 70 to 75
off the curve; and a 21-year final, 20-year average life with price talk at
105 over Treasurys.
     One buy-side source said those spreads offered some decent value.
French-based Airbus Industrie, an equipment manufacturer, is considered a
double A minus credit.
     Last January Salomon led a  $108 million leveraged lease transaction
for Airbus broken into two tranches. Final pricing was not available. But
the 10-year average life strip started at 85 basis points over the curve;
while price talk on the 20-year average life tranche started at 115 basis
points over Treasurys.
     The raised capital from the 1995 deal financed the purchase of four
A320 aircraft. Although the planes went to United Airlines, the deal was
based on Airbus' credit.

BANKS EXPLOIT WIDENING SPREADS

After being unable to come to terms with investors on a $75 million
proposed issue via BA Securities, Empresa Nacional deMineria opted for bank
financing late last year. But is Enami's fate indicative of what will
happen to similar issues in 1996?
     When Enami, Chile's second largest copper producer, hit the market in
late October, price talk was a tight 95 off the curve for the seven-year
paper. But the BBB+ paper quickly widened to 120.
     "The market was demanding much wider spreads than was initially
anticipated," a source said.
     Unfortunately for Enami, its entry into the market coincided with a
general widening of emerging market spreads, particularly those "quasi"
emerging markets whose sovereign rating is investment grade, such as Chile,
Malaysia and the Czech Republic, sources said.
     For instance, a recent public Chilean deal from Celulosa Arauco y
Constitucion SA also had to swallow a wider spread than initially
anticipated. An eight-year tranche that started at 80 over Treasurys got
done at 105 and has since traded even wider.
     "It's not a dramatic shift, and it's not just Chile, and it'll still
be a good year," a source said. "But you'd expect it to be a runaway year
for issuance given that long-term interest rates are at a 20-year low. But
with banks so aggressive, I don't think you'll see the amount of issues in
the private market you might expect. The few basis points (the banks will
give over institutional investors) do matter."

COBHAM LOOKS FOR U.S. INVESTORS

Schroder Wertheim was circulating a $50 million issue last week for
Cobham plc., a U.K.-based aerospace company.
     The 12-year final, 10-year average life notes were being talked at 80
off the curve, though a source said New York Life had offered to take a $15
million portion at a spread of 85.
     Cobham, considered an A- credit, is a private company with 1994 sales,
the last year a figure was available, of $278 million.

SCHMIT EXITS MUTUAL OF OMAHA

Thomas Schmit has resigned from Mutual of Omaha. He had been at the
insurance company for 26 years, all of that time in the realm of private
placements. For the past six years he was head of the department.
     Schmit, 52, is currently pursuing options both in and outside the
Omaha area.
     Mutual of Omaha has not yet appointed a replacement, and is reportedly
considering whether to hire a junior or senior person. In 1994, the insurer
did $650 million of private placement volume.

THE DEUTSCHE BANK SHUFFLE

Joe Rowan resigned as head of private placements at Deutsche Bank as
of the end of last year, sources said.
     A spokesperson for the bank declined to say whether Rowan would be
replaced or to comment on the future of the private placement department.
     However, sources said Rowan may have been a casualty of Deutsche
Bank's decision to bring several Merrill Lynch people into its fixed-income
department.

PUERTO RICAN BANK ISSUES 144A

After eying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Rico
became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt in
December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100 million offering
of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis points over
Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The notes,
which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language, enabling
a public-style execution of the offering without registration at the
Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted from
Standard & Poor's rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie
Astor, chief financial officer.
     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates in
December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank to
issue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's first
independent bond offering.
     Jefferies & Co. captured the lead underwriting position on the deal
because of its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney Inc. acted as
co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15 insurance
companies.
     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by the bank's
phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had an average
return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the bank's
initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated in value
by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion asset
bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last year.
     The deal for FirstBank follows a first-time subordinated offering by
another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the month. BanPonce
Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in 10-year
subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125
million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparable
Treasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston. --John Hintze

ALVEY TO FINANCE ACQUISITION

Alvey Systems, Inc. plans to issue a $100 million 144A of six-year,
senior subordinated notes to help fund an acquisition and a buyout of an
equity partner. Moody's Investors Service has rated the notes B3.
     Alvey designs, engineers and produces materials flow equipment and
software.
     The rating reflects Alvey's high leverage as a result of a quasi-
management buyout/acquisition in conjunction with this note issue, which
follows numerous debt-financed acquisitions in the past seven years; its
limited track record as a fully integrated company; and the subordination
of the notes to a $30 million secured bank facility and any future senior
debt.
     These risks are moderated, however, by the company's broad and
innovative product offerings; its stable cash flows from a diversified
customer base; and the growing demand for the kind of complex, custom-
designed material handing systems that Alvey assembles.

A.P.S. ISSUE GETS JUNK RATING

A.P.S.' proposed $100 million issue of 10-year senior, subordinated
notes has been rated B2 by Moody's Investors Service.
     The company is an automotive replacement parts manufacturer and
distributor. Most of the raised capital will be used to acquire Parts, Inc.
for $80 million and to repay A.P.S. bank debt.
     The rating reflects A.P.S.'s high financial leverage, short
profitability history, intensely competitive business environment,
vulnerability to weather conditions, short operating history with its mini-
warehouses and high supplier concentration. It also considers uncertainties
relating to the purchase of Parts, Inc. and future acquisitions as well as
the subordination of the notes.
     Mitigating factors include improving profitability prospects, positive
demand fundamentals, good industry position, limited risk of obsolete
inventory, adequacy of capital for attracting additional sales locations,
and substantial benefits provided by Parts, Inc.

MARKET RADAR


     Traditionals'
     ABN-AMRO priced a $70 million issue recently from Uniboard Canada. The
NAIC-2, senior notes have an eight-year final, six-year average life and
priced at 145 over Treasurys. The company makes fiberboard and particle
board.
     BOT Financial was in the market with a $40 million issue from United
Healthcare Corp. The notes have a 12-year final, 10-year average life.
     Daiwa Securities has reportedly received a mandate for an issue from
Compania Vale do Rio Doce, more popularly known as CVRD, a Brazilian mining
company.
     ING Securities and UBS Securi-ties have reportedly received a Mexican
mandate for a $75 million deal securitized by steel.
     Robertson Stephens reportedly placed $10 million of subordinated notes
for Individual Inc.
     Chilgener, which recently issued a $110 million private placement, has
just had a proposed, 10-year public deal of $150 million senior notes rated
Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service.

     144As'
     Goldman Sachs is reportedly bringing an investment grade issue from
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. No other details were available at press time.
     Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were on the road last week with a $75
million, high-yield issue from B.E. Aerospace, which makes commercial
aircraft interiors. The 10-year senior subordinated notes are noncallable
for five years.
     Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro/144A via
Salomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive. The
three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 basis points over
U.S. Treasurys. The deal was popular with European retail investors, but
some U.S. investors were not impressed. "You can get Nafinsa paper with the
same spread for shorter maturities," one said.
     Smith Barney and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette are bringing a $150
million 144A for KCS Energy, a New Jersey-based exploration and production
company. The seven-year issue, noncallable for four years, has been rated
B1.

MOODY'S RATES BRAZILIAN ISSUE

Moody's Investors Service has assigned a B1 rating to the notes of
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA (Telebras). Approximately $720 million of
debt is affected.
     The rating is supported by Telebras' established position as the
monopoly provider of Brazil's telecommunications services. Although the
Brazilian government has begun to liberalize the telecommunications market,
it will likely do so very gradually and will take steps to make Telebras
more competitive.

U.S. INVESTORS INHALE ELM

Timing was everything for Mexican cigarette company, Empresas La
Moderna, which increased its long awaited Euro/ 144A to $125 million last
week.
     ELM's three-year issue, joint led by ING Securities and J.P. Morgan,
was oversubscribed by a two to one margin and enlarged from $100 million.
ELM was to launch the deal last November but backed out due to a difficult
market environment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,
carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia and
Europe.
     "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds," says
Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It was relatively
attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and is well priced
and valued."
     Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELM issue
last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was swayed back by the
changing sentiment toward Mexico.-- Dan Levine
