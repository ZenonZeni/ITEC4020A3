U.K., U.S. SLASH ACCOUNTING RATES -- Resale Era
Begins

    By DENIS GILHOOLY

         LONDON

   The economic tide has turned.

   Experts may quibble over what precipitated the change in pricing
international telecommunications services, but there is no turning back.

      The recommendation by the U.K. Office of Telecommunications to allow
simple resale of capacity on international circuits lays the groundwork for a
new bilateral agreement on international resale between the United States and
the United Kingdom, as well as for a web of such agreements between
countries.

   Resale promises to unleash a wave of price competition and choice in
international telecoms.

   Already, resale is exerting downward pressure on the accounting-rate
system by which countries divide their income from international services.

   In August, the decision to open the resale market between Canada and the
United States was followed by an almost halving of the agreed accounting
rate.

   And earlier this month AT&T and MCI Communications Corp. filed with the
Federal Communications Commission for substantial accounting-rate
reductions over the next three years with British Telecom and Mercury
Communications Ltd.

   Inevitably, the trend towardtotal market liberalization across the Atlantic
is exposing the worst distortions in Europe.

   Analysis to be released later this year by the European Commission
documents the disarray of intra-European tariffs.

   In what the Commission terms the ``frontier effect,'' users are forced
to pay, on average, two-and-a-half times more for an international call
than for an equivalent domestic long distance call.

   After conducting its own study, the Commission's competition
directorate decided further action is necessary. Directorate commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan said he will launch an investigation of international telecoms
pricing across Europe.

France Blazes Data Net Trail

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         TOULOUSE, FRANCE-France Telecom is building a series of
high-speed, fiber optic networks that will provide data communications to
specific industries and other communities in France.

   Having proven this custom-designed network concept with a backbone
linking research organizations in Sophia Antipolis, the operator is expected
to open its second such network this month, in Toulouse.

   This network will serve Toulouse's sizable scientific and aerospace
industries.

   France Telecom will also soon build a network for the medical community in
one French city and is looking to provide networks among banks and other
commercial enterprises.

   The networks will deploy compatible but not necessarily identical broadband
technology.

   The networks in Toulouse and Sophia Antipolis are likely to progress to the
fiber distributed data interface local area network standard, for example, but
the operator has not ruled out using metropolitan area networking technology
for subsequent networks.

   Francois Croisille, a France Telecom custom design manager, said the
operator may install between 15 and 20 such networks by 1992.

   The Toulouse network will be built with a fiber backbone and link eight
organizations' computer centers and LANs, initially at speeds of up
to 2 megabits per second. The second phase of the project will increase speeds
to 34 mbps.

   Georges Sans, divisional manager for networks at Centre National
d'Etudes Spatial, a user of the Toulouse network, said similar
networks are planned near Paris-to link France's Atomic Energy
Commission and the National Institute for Information Research-and in
Marseille and Grenoble, all next year.

SWIFT Sets New Agenda

    By DAWN HAYES

         oBERLIN-SWIFT, the networking cooperative of 2,000 banks
worldwide, will begin moving into new competitive service sectors this week as
it claims a contract to network an emerging European foreign exchange
system.

   The contract is expected to be awarded by the Exchange Clearing House
Organization, a group of 25 European banks building a common clearing house
for European foreign exchange, SWIFT officials said.

   ECHO would establish the first multilateral foreignexchange settlement
system in the world, in 1992. The networked computer system would
substantially reduce banks' administrative costs by replacing the
bilateral arrangements through which they now settle foreign-exchange
transactions.

   But the ECHO contract represents just one facet of SWIFT's broad
mandate to generate new services to thwart mounting competition.

   At their annual conference this month in Berlin, SWIFT officials also said
they hope to draw the corporate customers of the society's bank
members onto the SWIFT network, which would boost traffic.

   SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications,
also intends to move into the market for managed data network services.

   And a recent decision by SWIFT to use the EDIFACT standard for electronic
data interchange is key to its entry into a broader range of value-added
network services, according to David Birch, director of marketing at Hyperion
Systems Ltd., a Guildford, England, consultancy.

   With increasing competition in the financial services market, growth in
message volumes for SWIFT slowed in 1989 to 15 percent, from an average of up
to 20 percent in the previous five years.

   And signs indicate that growth will continue to slip unless SWIFT harnesses
a new competitive direction in the 1990s, a banking source said.

    ``Innovation may not pay,'' said SWIFT chief executive Bessel Kok,
``but non-innovation may lead to loss of markets.''

   The ECHO project, along with others SWIFT is considering, will take the
17-year-old not-for-profit organization beyond its core
business of interbank transfers for payments and statements transfers and into
a new commercial environment.

Alcatel Hits Back -- Italian Merger To Counter
AT&T

    By ANNE-MARIE ROUSSEL

         MILAN-A merger of Alcatel's Italian subsidiary with
the telecoms unit of Italy's Fiat SpA would hit AT&T in
the European markets where it is making the most headway: Italy and
Spain.

   The deal, disclosed this month, calls for Alcatel-Face to merge with
Telettra SpA.

   It is ``a direct answer to everything that AT&T has done in Europe for
the past two years,'' said Didier Pouillot, an analyst with French
research house Idate.

   By entering Italy through such a powerful player as Telettra, which has 33
percent of the local transmission equipment market, Alcatel appears to be
responding to last year's deal between AT&T and Italian
manufacturer Italtel SpA.

   In addition, Alcatel will inherit Telettra's 45 percent share of
the transmission equipment market in Spain-another country AT&T
is starting to penetrate, through the sale of public switches. Just last
month, the U.S. manufacturer opened a new switching plant near Madrid.

   On a more global level, Alcatel is now in a position to overtake AT&T
as the world's largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. As Pouillot noted,
Alcatel's 15 percent annual growth rate is well above that of AT&T's
equipment business, which is close to zero.

    ``I expect that Alcatel will be ahead of AT&T by the end of 1990,''
Pouillot said.

OPTIMISM TEMPERED

   But such anticipated results are tempered by the potential of a political
backlash in Italy. The Alcatel-Telettra deal has dashed the hopes of
state-run industrial group IRI, the holding company for Italtel. IRI had
long been negotiating to merge Telettra with Italtel into an entity to be
called Telit.

   The agreement between Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, Alcatel's
parent company, and Fiat has prompted sour comments from IRI president
Franco Nobili. ``This agreement will make it more difficult to form
national industrial poles [in Italy],'' he was quoted in the Italian
press.

   Italy, which in 1988 embarked on a five-year, $43.5 billion
program to upgrade the country's telecoms infrastructure, was
expected to award Telettra about one-third of the transmission equipment
contracts.

   But the Italian government could decide to pull back, following the same
route the United States took recently when France's Groupe Bull SA
bought the computer operations of Illinois-based Zenith Electronics Corp.
Following the purchase, the U.S. government decided to renegotiate all its
contracts with Zenith.

   The new Alcatel-Telettra entity-to be based in Milan and owned 75
percent by Alcatel, 25 percent by Fiat-is to be formed by the end of next
month.

   With the addition of Telettra, Alcatel must now expand into developing
areas, particularly mobile communications, said Christopher Thomas, an analyst
with London's Systems Dynamics Ltd.

   Telettra's transmission specialty includes mobile communications
systems. It supplied Italian operator SIP with a 900-megahertz analog
system, and has contracts to supply part of the network infrastructure for
trials of the Italian, Spanish, Swiss and U.K. links of the planned GSM
pan-European digital cellular system.

SOME FIBER SYSTEMS TO BE COMBINED -- Asian Cables
Plotted

    By ROBERT POE

         SINGAPORE-Network operators from 12 countries have signed
agreements on construction and maintenance of the first three links of the
planned ASEAN optical fiber cable system.

   An official also revealed that parts of the system will be combined with
other cables planned for the Asia-Pacific region, to improve connectivity
and save costs.

   The US $320 million system, planned to link the six members of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) by 1995, will connect with
other systems to provide fully fiber optic undersea routes to both Europe and
North America.

   Besides those from the ASEAN nations of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Singapore, carriers from Australia, Canada, Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the ASEAN
system agreements.

   Singapore Telecom president and chief executive officer Wong Hung Khim said
the first link covered by the agreements, connecting Kuantan and Kota Kinabalu
in different parts of Malaysia, is due to be completed in December. A link
between Brunei and Singapore is to begin service late next year. The cable
connecting Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines will be commissioned in the
first quarter of 1992, Wong said.

   In addition, he said, the Malaysia-Singapore link of the ASEAN system
will be part of the recently integrated Aspac-Kyutai system
(CommunicationsWeek International, 3 September). Aspac-Kyutai,
now called APC, will link Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and two
points in Japan starting in mid-1993.

   The Indonesia-Singapore 2 link of the ASEAN system will be part of the
SEA-ME-WE 2 cable planned to connect Southeast Asia, the Middle East
and Europe. A Malaysia-Thailand cable will complete the system.

Shakeup At ETSI -- Users Lose Important Voice In
Standards

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

   SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS, FRANCE-Users appear to have lost the chairmanship of
a key technical committee at the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute-a development that could have broad implications for user
involvement in the European standards-making process.

   At press time it appeared that Business Telecommunications Committee
Chairman Jan Thurmer would be replaced by either Benoit Gasztowtt from
France's Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications or by Bjorn Hansen
from the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. Gasztowtt was supported
by Alcatel, Siemens AG and other manufacturers; Hansen, by public network
operators and L.M. Ericsson.

   The Business Telecommunications Committee is charged with formulating
standards for private and public networks and attached terminal equipment.

   ETSI Technical Committee Director Stephen Temple asked Thurmer to resign
his position and instead head a new brainstorming group that will look at how
to get users more involved in ETSI activities.

   The immediate result of his new job, however, is that users are losing
direct involvement in standards.

   Thurmer, the network manager at Nordsk Hydro AS, an Oslo-based
chemical, oil and retailing group, was the only user chosen to head one of
ETSI's 12 standards committees. Representatives from telecoms
administrations or manufacturers run the other 11 ETSI technical
committees.

   Manufacturer officials questioned whether users belong in the chair
position.

   ``A user is not interested in what is inside a machine, he is
interested in what it can do,'' said Gerard Robin, who is
responsible for Alcatel's standards activities worldwide and vice
chairman of ETSI's adhoc group on rules of procedure.

   Robin said PBX manufacturers have supported their own candidate not
because they want to promote a particular solution but because ``we don't
want to again go through the pains of having a chairman who is not in a
position to understand all the problems.''

   He said a good compromise solution would be to appoint a user as vice
chairman.

ETSI EVOLUTION

   ETSI, created in 1988, took over some of the work from the Conference of
European Postal and Telecommunications administration (CEPT). Until
ETSI was formed, users and manufacturers did not have decision-making
power on standards, which were usually decided on in secret by
administrations.

   A user serves as vice president of ETSI's general assembly, but
since the organization still remains heavily dominated by CEPT it was also
considered important to have direct user influence on technical questions.

   As in other ETSI committees, the Business Telecommunications Committee
comprises manufacturers and operators often favoring divergent approaches to
critical networking questions.

   When ETSI selects the new chairman of the committee, ``I hope the
person who will get the job will try to be objective and concentrate on the
technical job and not be steered by the administration or company he works
for,'' Thurmer said.

   Thurmer was nominated as a candidate for the Business Telecommunications
chairmanship by the International Telecommunications Users Group and has held
the position since May 1989.

   But his travel expenses between Norway and France and the time required by
the ETSI chairmanship put a strain on his company, he said.

   INTUG proposed another candidate, the network manager of a major Dutch
corporation. That candidate's company is reportedly prepared to bear
the expenses involved.

Reregulating

    By JOHN BLAU AND KAREN LYNCH

         BONN-Deutsche Bundespost minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling has
drafted new regulations that could ease the establishment of private
networks and competitive services in Germany.

   The regulations, to go into effect in July, would implement the policy
initiatives included in the German telecommunications reform law of last
year.

   While the law called for competition in all but basic telephone service,
users and potential competitors have continued to complain that Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom, the German operator, has been blocking competition and
refusing to bring its tariffs in line with costs.

   DBP Telekom was given two years from the signing of the reform bill to
adjust its commercial terms to the new competitive market. But industry
sources say Telekom has not been moving fast enough in this direction.

   Now, Schwarz-Schilling has asked industry and users to comment on a
broad range of regulatory proposals. The draft includes such competitive
conditions as a guarantee that all private operators would be assured the same
tariffs and conditions as DBP Telekom when leasing lines for value-added
network services.

   Schwarz-Schilling also proposes a removal of the limitations on voice
channeling and voice compression over data lines and a narrower definition of
the network monopoly in terms of transmission and network termination, making
many of the interfaces, such as X.21, competitive.

   In a separate development, he also launched a debate to define which
mandatory services DBP Telekom must provide ``in the public
interest, particularly on account of its obligation to make services and
facilities available to the general public.''

   At issue is whether DBP Telekom would be obliged to continue to provide
services that are unprofitable.

   Related issues include the means by which Telekom would be allowed to cover
the costs of unprofitable services, and the possible sharing of those costs by
competitors.

   Schwarz-Schilling is circulating a list of questions, seeking comment
from national and international sources by mid-November.

   While the debate now focuses on such services as telex and telegram,
Schwarz-Schilling's questions pave the way for a larger debate
on the obligation to provide telecoms services nationwide under uniform terms
and conditions, rather than provide such services only where they are
profitable.

   Among his questions:

   o What should be the criteria for deciding whether a new service is of
an infrastructural nature, and thus has to be declared a mandatory
service?

   o What service features should be included in the regulation of
mandatory services (for example, nationwide coverage, uniform tariffs
throughout the service area, quality, compatible standards and
rates)?

   o What should happen to services that do not cover costs?

OSI MAY NEVER OVERSHADOW SNA -- Is IBM
Committed?

    By MALCOLM LAWS

         LA GAUDE, FRANCE

   IBM's facility in La Gaude is one of only two
manufacturer-owned laboratories in Europe approved for testing whether
products conform to Open Systems Interconnection standards. Similar labs are
typically run by specialist, independent organizations.

   IBM suggests the facility shows its commitment to open systems, not just
its own Systems Network Architecture. But the company's position on
standards remains ambiguous, despite its recently stated commitment to
improved OSI support.

   Opinions vary.

   Laurent Halphen, secretary of SHARE, a European group of 506 IBM users,
said at the organization's biannual conference in Paris last month
that it is significant that IBM now starts its announcements with talk of open
systems, evidence that it is listening to its customers.

   But Peter Rigg, managing consultant at Logica plc, in London, said
``OSI still comes second and quite a long way behind
SNA.''

   Once reluctant to embrace standards, IBM has had to change its stance in
the face of customer demand for open networks. Yet critics say that despite
the greater prominence IBM gives to open systems, its proprietary systems come
first. They say that until big IBM users demand OSI-a prospect some years
away-it will remain in the background. It does not help that IBM has not
produced list prices for its OSI products.

   IBM promises to offer wide-ranging support, not just for OSI and SNA,
but also for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, widely seen as a
practical interim step toward OSI.

   Before long, IBM could well earn much of its money building networks that
link its own computers with those from rivals like Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co., using OSI protocols as well as SNA and TCP/IP.

IBM'S OSI BATCH

   Last month, IBM ushered in a new batch of OSI products
(CommunicationsWeek International, 1 October). They are designed,
for the first time, to run across all IBM's strategic Systems
Application Architecture operating systems: MVS and VM on mainframes;
OS/400; and OS/2 Extended Edition on the Personal System/2 workstation. Some
of the OSI programs are available now, while the rest will be phased in over
the next 12 months.

   SHARE's Halphen said the September announcements ``addressed the
greater part of what we asked for'' in OSI products.

   IBM has replaced its original Open Systems Network Support and Open
Systems Transport and Session Support programs with its new
OSI/Communications Subsystem. Over this runs the X.400 Open Network
Distributed System-with gateways into the Professional Office System
(Profs) and Distributed Office Support System (Disoss) and OSI File
Services, an implementation of the OSI File Transfer Access and Management
standard.

   Where previously IBM's OSI programs could access only X.25 wide
area packet switching networks, the new OSI range will also have routes across
integrated services digital networks and standard token-ring, Ethernet,
token bus and fiber distributed data interface LANs.

   But IBM is not a convert to standards as a cure for all computing ills.
Some manufacturers are moving to drop their own data communications
architectures in favor of OSI, and others, notably DEC, say they will give
equal prominence to standard and proprietary architectures. IBM has
consistently argued that it does not make sense to drop SNA, which remains,
the company says, the best way to link IBM systems.

    Jeff Hosier, a director of Xephon Ltd., a Newbury, England,
consultancy that specializes in IBM, said ``any IBM user would be off his
trolley to get too deep into OSI,'' because SNA is so much richer and
readily available.

OSI RELUCTANCE

   All IBM mainframe OSI programs run on the Virtual Telecommunications Access
Method, the main SNA software subsystem that controls session and resource
management across the network, for wide area communications. No native OSI
implementations are possible for remote links between IBM mainframe operating
systems, at least as far as IBM is concerned.

   Logica's Rigg said that although it is possible to bypass VTAM, it is
not worth the effort. VTAM is a stable, widely understood and
sophisticated system, he said, although it is expensive and can slow down
sessions where it has to process OSI protocols. ``VTAM offers a consistent
programming interface and it is the last SNA component I would encourage
users to move away from,'' Rigg said.

   Direct connection of IBM computers to LANs is through the 3172
communications controller. Again, remote mainframe sessions must go via VTAM
and IBM's Network Control Program's Packet Switching
Interface for X.25, or the 7820 ISDN adapter.

   John Westgate, an independent consultant who advises the U.K. Department of
Industry and edits a guide to OSI products, said he is impressed with
IBM's open systems efforts. And because governments have so much
buying power, when it comes to open systems especially, what IBM does to
please them is important-not just for itself, but for supporters of the
open systems cause.

   But continued differences from one country to another in the way OSI is
implemented also means that IBM can justify its continued support for SNA.
Xephon's Hosier said SNA, as a communications standard, ``is as strong as,
if not stronger than, OSI''-a point IBM is unlikely to contest.

Foreign Carriers Vie For Teleport

    Foreign telecoms carriers have been vying for entry into the North
American carrier market by seeking a stake in Merrill Lynch &
Co.'s Teleport Communications Group, based in Staten Island, New
York.

   The group, which operates metropolitan area networks in New York and other
U.S. cities, has been rumored to be up for sale for several months.

   Sources close to the negotiations say Japan's Kokusai Denshin
Denwa, France Telecom, British Telecom and Cable & Wireless plc have
all met with Merrill Lynch in an effort to work out a deal.

   Most, however, have balked at Merrill's asking price, said to be
in the $175 million to $200 million range.

Hong Kong's CT2 Plans, Bidders

    Hong Kong Postmaster General Dominic Wong said he expects to select
three or four of the six consortia that bid to operate CT2 service in the
territory. But on 28 September, the deadline for submitting bids, Wong
said he hoped for ``imaginative'' proposals and that he is open to
persuasion.

   Most of the bids were from consortia with significant overseas
participation. Most planned to spend HK $300 million to HK $400 million
(US $38 million to US $51 million) on infrastructure over five years.

   Hong Kong Telecom CSL, the value-added services arm of Hong Kong
Telecommunicatons Ltd., teamed with Star Paging (Holdings) Ltd. and SHK
Industries Ltd., a company backed by the territory's leading property
developers. Hutchison Telecommunicatons Ltd. subsidiary Hutchison Paging
bid jointly with Motorola Inc. and Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. A
group called Personal Communications Ltd. is backed by locally listed
First Pacific Co. (with a 50 percent interest in one of the territory's
three cellular operators), British Telecom, paging company ABC
Communications and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.

   Meta Communications combines interests controlled by local entrepreneur
Dickson Poon with Beijing-owned China Resources (Holdings)
Ltd., Onwel Strategic Holdings and BellSouth Enterprises Inc. Chevalier
(OA) International Ltd., a local conglomerate, formed a joint
venture with OTC International of Australia. Singapore Telecom International
Pte. Ltd., in partnership with Steamers Telecommunications Ltd., also of
Singapore, formed a Hong Kong joint-venture company called Halkis Ltd. to
pursue a CT2 license.

    A seventh submission, made by GEC-Plessey Telecommunications Ltd.,
was not an application but a series of observations on the application of CT2
in Hong Kong.

Fujitsu's Euro-Focus

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         STOCKLEY PARK, ENGLAND-Fujitsu Ltd. is putting Europe at the
forefront of its telecommunications strategy, forming its first European
telecoms research and development center to participate more in local
standards-setting and equipment development.

   Fiber optics and mobile telephony will be the Japanese manufacturer's
two main research focuses in Europe, said Sir Brian Tovey, chairman of
Fujitsu Europe Telecom R&D Centre Ltd. The creation of FTRC, in Stockley
Park, allows Fujitsu to ``build its telecoms strategy on a European
base,'' he said.

   In the area of standards-making, Fujitsu will apply to join the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute. It will likely be
accepted so long as it shows a ``legitimate interest in European
telecommunications,'' said Frede Ask, deputy director of ETSI. He said
Japanese suppliers NEC Corp. and Panasonic are already ETSI members.

   FTRC, Fujitsu's seventh European subsidiary, will also develop
for the European market equipment based on the international Synchronous
Digital Hierarchy standard. SDH, also known as Synchronous Digital Network, or
Sonet, allows multiplexed data transmission over digital networks for local
access systems.

   Specifically, Fujitsu plans to develop its Fiber Loop Multiplexers, which
it now sells in Japan and the United States, for sale to large European
network operators, said Akira Miyata, general manager of the
company's overseas transmission systems division. ``We are
very confident [of supplying SDH] if we can compete equally with
local suppliers,'' Miyata said.

   British Telecom, which recently pulled back on its strategy for
purchasing flexible access systems-an alternative to SDH-will be Fujitsu's
first target customer, Miyata said. Fujitsu's European drive into telecoms
coincides with its pending purchase of International Computers Ltd. from
STC plc-which itself was to have been BT's supplier of flexible access
equipment.

   Fujitsu chairman Takuma Yamamoto, in a recent interview, said the Japanese
company will likely expand in Europe through partnerships with locally based
manufacturers.

   Fujitsu is already active in Europen telecoms. Its contract to supply
undersea optical cables for a 500-kilometer link between England and
Germany, due to be completed in July, marked the first such success in Europe
by a Japanese manufacturer. Fujitsu also supplies transmission systems, and
makes facsimile machines and modems in Malaga, Spain, where it will also
produce small PBXs beginning next year.

   Fujitsu spent $375,000 to set up FTRC. It plans to recruit up to 30
researchers in the center's first year of operation, which begins
later this month.

   Fujitsu has no plans to set up telecoms manufacturing facilities in the
United Kingdom, said FTRC director Hachihei Kurematsu.

CEPT Begets ECTRA

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

         LONDON-A new group representing telecoms regulatory authorities
from 31 countries is making European policy on licensing procedures for
value-added services, international accounting principles and satellite
and mobile communications its top priorities.

   The European Committee on Regulatory Affairs (ECTRA), a group created
as part of the radical structural reform of the Conference of European
Postal and Telecommunications administrations, formally set its working
agenda for the next two years during an extraordinary meeting in London
late last month.

   ECTRA was created under the reorganization of CEPT, which includes the
separation of operational and regulatory functions (CommunicationsWeek
International, 12 March).

   The idea is for ECTRA to be staffed by independent government
representatives. However, the majority of Europe's public network
operators have yet to separate their own regulatory and operational
functions.

   In the meantime, most of ECTRA's staff members are being drawn from
national telecommunications ministries, with some ``wearing two hats,''
said committee chairman John Rietbroek, who is director of policy affairs
and deputy head of the department of telecommunications and post at the
Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works.

ECTRA's new working agenda includes:

   o drafting proposals for common harmonized licensing and declaration
procedures for private value-added network service operators before the
end of 1991;

   o studying whether European regulators could propose changes in the
accounting principles or international telephone calls set by the
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee;

   o evaluating the role of regulators in European equipment testing and
certification;

   o participating in the consultation process that will follow the
release of the European Commission's draft Blue Paper on satellites;
and

   o harmonizing mobile communications regulatory policy across
Europe.

Germany Postponing Telepoint

    The Deutsche Bundespost has postponed until next year its issue of private
telepoint licenses.

   Wolf-Joachim Zeidel, director of mobile communications licensing at
the Bundespost, said that licensing procedures for paging and trunked radio
communications must be completed before introducing telepoint.

   Telepoint, a cordless personal communications technology, lets users make
calls outside their homes to base stations located in busy public places.
Users near these stations are then linked to the public network.

    DBP Telekom is conducting telepoint field trials to test the CT2 and
CT1-plus cordless telephone systems. A third trial, for a combination of
the technologies, was cancelled ``for scheduling reasons.'' It is thought
the incompatible analog CT1-plus system has little chance of being picked
following DBP Telekom's decision to sign the memorandum of understanding
on the CT2 common air interface.

Trading Tangled In Technology

    Two U.S. agencies that oversee the nation's financial markets
should update rules and merge to cope with the rising use of technology by
financial institutions, says a report issued by a congressional agency.

   Traditional trading methods are under increasing stress from rising
volume, the Office of Technology Assessment said in ``Electronic Bulls and
Bears: U.S. Securities Markets and Information Technology.'' Frequent
trading of large blocks of stock and ``program trading''-using computers
to buy baskets of stocks-complicate the volatility.

   The office recommended that the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission merge or be replaced by one agency to
alleviate conflicting policies.

The Underside Of French `Reform'

    A draft of France's new telecommunications ``reform'' contains
potential stumbling blocks for service providers.

   The draft, which the French Parliament is due to review this week, is
supposed to open the markets for X.25 packet switching and ISDN services to
competition by 1993. However, it proposes that tariff restraints be placed on
competitors. It also says value-added services providers competing with
France Telecom should ``make a contribution to education, training
and research'' and raises the possiblity of access charges
for interconnection to the public network.

    Another provision says the amount of capital held in French VANS providers
by a non-European Community investor cannot exceed 20 percent unless an
international treaty or agreement exists to allow it.

Competition Guidelines Debated

    The European Commission's competition guidelines will be a hot
topic at an informal meeting of Europe's telecommunications
ministers in Rome on 18 October.

   Member states are said to be upset by the competition guidelines, which are
intended to set rules for commercial behavior in the sector and guard against
monopoly abuses by the telecoms administrations. France filed a petition with
almost 100 objections at a meeting of the Commission's Senior
Officials Group on Telecommunications earlier this month.

Argentine Network Deal Falls Apart

    By DAVID ROCKS

         BUENOS AIRES-After months of bickering and negotiating,
Argentina's government finds itself in exactly the same place it started:
operating one of the world's worst phone companies.

   The country's Empresa Nacional de Telecommunications
(ENTel) was to be split into two zones and handed over on 8 October
to private operating groups headed by Spain's Telefonica and Bell
Atlantic Corp.

   But Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corp., the U.S. bank that spearheaded Bell
Atlantic's bid, did not come up with the financing by the Argentine
government's 4 October deadline.

   So when the deadline arrived, the government forbade Bell Atlantic and
Manufacturers Hanover from taking control of the northern zone. Telefonica
then declined to assume management of the southern portion until northern
ownership is clarified.

   The government has given a group headed by Italian telecoms holding company
STET and France Telecom unit France Cables et Radio a chance to run ENTel
north in place of Bell Atlantic.

   The European group, which includes Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., has until 1
November to come up with financing and an operating plan.

   The privatization of ENTel, a company perhaps best known for its poor
service, is a key to President Carlos Menem's economic plan. The two
portions were to have fetched a total of $214 million in cash and more
than $5 billion in debt.

   The Bell Atlantic consortium was to have presented the Argentine government
with $100 million in cash and Argentine debt paper worth some
$2.3 billion for a 60 percent stake in the northern zone.

   But the bid started falling apart in September, when Manufacturers Hanover
could not line up enough bank support, U.S. bankers in Argentina said.

   Carlos Agote, head of Manufacturers Hanover's Argentine
operations, and Bell Atlantic International president C. Hyde Tucker said they
remained hopeful that the Bell Atlantic group could be allowed back in.

   Joe Goldman contributed to this story.

Shinto Sentenced

    By Robert Poe

         TOKYO-Hisashi Shinto, the 80-year-old former chairman
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., was convicted last week of bribery in
the insider-trading scandal that deposed a number of Japanese
politicians.

   He was given a two-year suspended sentence and fined about
$175,000.

   Shinto was arrested in March 1989 and charged with accepting
low-priced stock of a subsidiary of information and publishing
conglomerate Recruit Co. before it was released for public sale. He then
resold the stock at a profit. In return, Recruit received favors from NTT that
benefited its leased-line resale business.

   Although most of Japan's leading politicians at the time had
similar dealings with Recruit, which eventually ruined their careers, none
were arrested. Observers said Shinto served as a scapegoat.

   The scandal forced Shinto to resign in December 1988, several months before
his arrest. NTT president Haruo Yamaguchi, Shinto's hand-picked
successor, had to take over sooner than expected.

COMMISSION LAUNCHES COMPETITION INQUIRY -- Tariff
Liberalization On Move

    By DENIS GILHOOLY

         LONDON

   Reform of the pricing structure for international telecommunications
services has taken on a momentum of its own.

   The proliferation of transoceanic fiber optic cables and growth rates of 15
percent to 20 percent a year in cross-border traffic have driven the
industry toward new regulatory arrangements on tariffs, accounting rates and
leased circuits far quicker than expected.

   The ground rules are being rewritten daily and the old order, under which
cooperative agreements were conducted within an exclusive club of monopoly
operators, is under siege.

   The proposed cuts in the accounting rate between the United States and
United Kingdom, for example, mark a major break with tradition by involving
four separate international carriers and two national regulatory agencies.

   The present accounting-rate structure was sharply criticized last year
by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
which charged it inhibits the growth of information services and restricts
international trade (CommunicationsWeek International, 27 November
1989).

   The OECD found no stable relationship over time between the accounting rate
(a negotiated sum split between the two carriers for each international
call), the prices charged to the customer, and the costs of providing the
service.

   A lack of transparency in accounting procedures and artificially high
rates, the OECD said, gives little incentive to lower tariffs.

EXTRA-TERRITORIAL

   In addition, it penalizes high traffic volume, growth in international
traffic, and low-cost operators, the organization said. As a result,
AT&T, for example, is running a trade deficit of more than $2
billion on its international telephone business, effectively subsidizing its
rival carriers. In 1988, the U.S. deficit with Mexico was $410 million;
$153 million with West Germany.

    The chronic U.S. deficit prompted the Federal Communications Commission to
issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Regulation of International
Accounting Rates in August. The deadline for reply comments was Friday, and
though these may influence the final outcome, the FCC's stated
position remains controversial.

   The ``reform'' package is designed to slice $1 billion of the deficit,
leading to cuts in U.S. international calling prices by perhaps as much as
50 percent.

   The FCC asserts that, under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, it has
``broad authority to regulate international telecoms services,
including international accounting rates.'' This posture
has led to charges of extra-territoriality.

   Critics argue that by dictating accounting rates, the FCC would not only
encroach on commercial decisions of telephone operators, but also be putting
unacceptable pressure on foreign countries.

   ``We might test the powers of the Communications Act,'' said FCC
Chairman Alfred Sikes. ``This has not been done before, but the FCC
intends to act aggressively in the area of accounting rates.''

   Sikes said a major factor in ``undermining fictitious accounting
rates'' would be to open the market for international simple resale of
telecoms services on a bilateral basis.

   In March, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
Commission liberalized resale and shared use of private-line services.
This meant that foreign callers using international private lines can access
the U.S. domestic telephone network and pay only the U.S. domestic rate plus
the cost of the international private line.

   AT&T subsequently complained to the FCC that this arrangement
undermined the entire accounting-rate system, permitted foreign carriers
to avoid settlement payments, and could result in one-way bypass.

   In late August, the Canadian authorities agreed to allow the
arrangement northbound as well as southbound. They also negotiated a
significantly lower accounting rate on all ``reduced'' and ``standard''
voice traffic between the two countries.

NO COINCIDENCE

   Moves by U.K. and U.S. carriers to negotiate a new international
accounting rate coincide with a recent recommendation by Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director general of the U.K. Office of Telecommunications. He
proposed that international simple resale of telecoms services be
permitted with countries that also allow it for calls to and from the
United Kingdom.

   Carsberg intends resale to be one way of stimulating more competition on
international calls. The other will be by capping British Telecom's
rates for international calls and its charges for international private
circuits. Both international resale and price capping will be considered as
part of the United Kingdom's forthcoming duopoly review.

   Simple resale involves the hiring of a private circuit from a telephone
company and using it to set up a competing service.

   ``Resale has been on the cards for years,'' said Iain Vallance,
chairman of BT. ``The worry would be if it was not done on a reciprocal
basis between countries. That would certainly be a bad deal for the U.K.''

   Though BT, Mercury Communications Ltd., AT&T and MCI Communications
Corp. have been in discussions for a year, the timing of their proposals
for a new accounting rate between the United Kingdom and the United States
reflects both the Oftel announcement on resale and last week's reply
deadline for the FCC inquiry.

   However, major differences exist between the proposals. AT&T, MCI
and Mercury have agreed to a single rate that will reduce the current
per-minute accounting rate from $1.06 to $0.76 by January
1991, falling to $0.40 by January 1993. But Mercury intends to abolish
its current off-peak rate.

   By contrast, AT&T, MCI and BT have agreed on two rates. The full
rate will be reduced from the current $1.06 to $0.76 by January
1991 and $0.44 by January 1993. The current off-peak rate will be
cut from $0.76 to $0.48 by January 1991 and $0.35 by
January 1993.

   ``We think the Mercury proposal to have a single rate is retrograde and
not in the interests of customers,'' said Adam Scott, BT international
affairs director.

   Mercury's low penetration of the residential market means it is
disadvantaged in offering very low off-peak rates.

   In fact, second-tier carriers such as Mercury and MCI will probably be
the hardest hit by international resale. While AT&T and BT, for
example, can weather fierce price competition because of their market shares,
the likes of Mercury and MCI have until now been winning market share by
undercutting the dominant carriers.

   A freer regulatory climate will also allow the larger carriers to be more
aggressive on price and in repackaging services for bulk discounts and virtual
private networks. If global VPNs are to flourish, more flexible international
accounting rates are essential.

   Just when telecoms resale between the United Kingdom and the United States
will begin depends on the outcome of the duopoly review, but discussions are
also underway between those countries and Japan and Sweden.

EUROPE NEXT?

   The pace of developments in the more liberalized markets is both exposing
gross tariff distortions in mainland Europe and placing pressure on the
European Commission to act.

   In March, the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications
administrations withdrew a controversial recommendation on principles for the
use of leased lines and the establishment of private networks-after being
advised by the Commission's competition directorate that the plan
amounted to a price agreement, restricted competition and breached Community
competition law.

   This action established a powerful precedent for the way leased lines
are priced and provided Europe-wide. And through tough new ``Competition
Guidelines'' the Commission is expected to adopt this year, it is
challenging the anti-competitive implications of the D-series
recommendations of the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative
Committee. The D-series currently sets pricing and supply conditions for
international leased circuits.

   Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner of competition, said the
Commission's  preliminary examination confirmed gross international
tariff distortions, but not necessarily evidence of a telephone company
``cartel.''

   ``There is prima face evidence, not of a conspiracy, but there is
something curious,'' Brittan said. ``So we are
launching a more formal investigation on prices to see what causes these
irrational, inexplicable and disturbing
discrepencies.''

DUOPOLY REVIEW Second Of A Series -- Cable Operators
Take On BT

    By DAWN HAYES

         LONDON

   Betting that the upcoming U.K. telecoms duopoly review will loosen
restrictions, cable TV operators at home and abroad are challenging British
Telecom's domination of local-loop telephone service.

   United Artists International, in partnership with U S West Inc., has been
granted approval by the Office of Telecommunications to run telephone service
to U.K. homes and businesses within its franchise area. And Canadian telecoms
holding company BCE Ltd. has applied to Oftel to initiate its first foray into
local telephone service in the United Kingdom, in partnership with Canadian
cable TV company Le Groupe Videotron.

   Only four of 135 cable TV operators in the United Kingdom offer telephone
service in what Oftel director general Sir Bryan Carsberg calls
experiments: Windsor Television Ltd., Cable Camden Ltd., East London
Telecommunications Ltd., and now United Artists.

   But more and more are expected to do so should Oftel ease local-loop
restrictions in its duopoly review.

   Cable companies already are allowed to provide all telecoms and datacoms
services; they must, however, be switched by either BT or Mercury
Communications Ltd.

   The U.K. Cable Television Association contends that present regulations
make it difficult for users to switch from one of the two main carriers to
cable TV operator networks. Users must add new, separate phone numbers to make
calls through a cable provider and must buy new wiring to change
operators.

   Despite today's constrictions, United Artists, a $1.2 billion cable
television and cinema company based in Denver, Colorado, this month
launched limited integrated services to business customers in Croydon and
to residential customers in Sutton.

   But Peter Streames, marketing operations manager, said phase two will
extend the service to many more customers in its franchise areas, depending,
that is, on the outcome of the duopoly review.

   In what observers interpret as the clearest indication yet of what his
position on cable television will be in the forthcoming duopoly review,
Carsberg last month pointed to cable TV as a key to unlocking the cozy
BT-Mercury telecoms duopoly.

    He said restrictions on cable TV companies must be reassessed but that in
return they may have to accept some form of universal-service obligation,
providing full service to residential customers and the more lucrative
business accounts.

INDUSTRY PROPOSAL

   Michael Storey, director of corporate strategy and public affairs at
Videotron, said the industry has proposed that cable TV companies be able to
lay their own networks free of BT or Mercury, interconnect with one
another's networks, and opt not to provide service to everyone in
their franchise areas.

   Still, the industry says it is willing to strike a balance to open the
local network to competition.

   There's incentive to compromise. So far cable television has
disappointed regulators and investors alike.

   Broadband cable television was first licensed in the United Kingdom in
1983, but only 0.5 percent of U.K. homes are connected to broadband cable,
according to London consultancy Enator Ltd.

   Beyond regulatory constraints, the cable TV companies have encountered
competition from other television distributors, including direct broadcast by
satellite. In addition, the removal of favorable tax incentives in 1984 slowed
the rate of cable construction over the last decade.

   Chris Akers, a London-based media analyst with Citicorp Investment
Bank Ltd., maintains that a shift in local-loop restrictions could boost
cable industry profits 10 percent.

   According to a recent Citicorp report, 90 percent of the United Kingdom
will have access to cable by December 2000, and 45 percent of homes will be
connected, assuming Oftel allows cable television companies to offer telephone
service without consent from British Telecom or Mercury.

FRESH BLOOD

   The Broadcasting Bill, which goes through Parliament this month, could give
the industry an infusion of fresh blood. It is expected to further free
restrictions on ownership of cable companies, enabling U.S. companies to fully
own and operate U.K. cable subsidiaries for the first time.

   Technology is a driving force behind the cable company push into
telecommunications. Fiber optics offers the high bandwidth needed for
integrated communications, thus blurring the boundary between broadcast and
telecoms.

   Meanwhile, the combined revenues from cable TV and telecoms services
strengthens the economic incentive for replacing copper wire in the local loop
with fiber optics.

    This was the conclusion of a government-sponsored study into
television funding in 1986. Called the Peacock Committee Report, it
recommended that British Telecom build and operate a national fiber optic grid
network, financed in part by the government.

   However, the proposal was at odds with the Conservative government's
free-market policy, which opposes public funding of large infrastructure
projects. The subsequent development of the mobile communications market
under the government's competitive policy further weakened the Peacock
Report's recommendations.

    A follow-up report, called the MacDonald Report, recommended that the
national grid approach be abandoned in favor of competition in the local
network from cable and mobile communications, driven by market demand.

BT MOVES

   BT itself invested in the cable TV industry over the last seven years but
plans to dispose of all those interests by the end of the year. BT says it
already has a local network and does not need to duplicate it with a cable TV
infrastructure.

   A BT spokesman said the move also relates to a drive to cut non-core
businesses.

   Kristen Hansen, with consultancy Enator, believes BT's goal is to
get out of cable television as a bargaining chip to persuade the government to
allow it to run entertainment services over its public network.

   BT argues that if the cable TV operators are given carte blanche to compete
in telecoms, Oftel must allow the former monopoly to compete on a commercial
basis in entertainment services.

   Currently, BT is permitted to carry broadcast television only so far as TV
companies' transmitters.

   This week, BT will launch a pilot integrated telephone/television service
in the Bishops Stortford area. The company has a special license to run the
service to test demand.

   Carsberg said BT would be permitted to provide entertainment services, but
emphasized that such a move would have to be timed to give cable television
companies a head start.

   While observers say this is a likely post-duopoly review scenario, the
timing remains in question.

   For Mercury's part, cable television could be the answer to criticism
that it failed to penetrate the local telephone service market other than
over BT's network.

   At the moment, to reach customers in areas not accessed by its fiber optic
trunk system connecting the major U.K. cities, Mercury sends calls via the BT
network.

   Mercury would like to see some restrictions on the cable companies freed,
but it does not want them to operate independently of either U.K. telecoms
operator. This way, Mercury can extend its reach via the cable company
networks.

   The cable television association maintains, however, that using cable to
extend Mercury's network amounts to extending the current duopoly.
Mercury does not favor introduction of additional trunk carriers.

OBSERVERS OPTIMISTIC

   For all the back and forth, industry observers are optimistic about cable
television's foray into telephony.

    Citicorp's Akers said he is confident that the duopoly review
will look favorably on cable television companies because there is presently
next to no competition in the local loop.

   ``They deserve some payback,'' Akers said.

   Meanwhile, the cable companies can only mull over Carsberg's
cryptic comment: ``Every referee knows there's no
such thing as a level playing field, only one in which both teams are playing
uphill.''

EDITORIAL -- Lines Of Resistance

    The recommendation by the U.K. Office of Telecommunications to open the
market for international simple resale of telecoms services is a
watershed.

   Its true impact may not be seen for a decade, but, if adopted by the U.K.
government, it would spell an end to the old order.

   In essence, it would undermine the regime of cozy, cooperative
relationships between national telecoms carriers that has underpinned the
industry for more than a century. It would signal the beginning of the end of
the accounting-rate mechanism between carriers that has propped up that
regime. And it would herald a new era of tariff arbitrage where the battle
between service suppliers would be for the delivery of end-to-end
telecoms services, delivered door-to-door.

   Equally important, international resale would allow large users to break
free of existing supplier relationships and, if they choose, engage in network
bypass for the first time. All business users, meanwhile, would quickly reap
the benefits of increased price competition.

   Everywhere, the cracks are beginning to show in the structure of
international telecoms tariffs. And the growing awareness that international
tariffs are not even remotely related to the cost of providing service is
reflected in a range of policy initiatives:

   o In Europe, the European Commission's competition directorate is
questioning the legality of long-standing International Telegraph and
Telephone Consultative Committee tariff recommendations under European
Community competition law. Separately, its telecoms directorate is
expected to issue a communication on voice telephony, leased-line and data
tariffs later this year.

   o In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission last
Friday received comments on its proposals for reforming the international
accounting rate system, which sets the negotiated sum between two carriers for
each international call. AT&T has already negotiated a major
accounting rate reduction with Canada. Both AT&T and MCI
Communications Corp. have now proposed major reductions with British Telecom
and Mercury Communications Ltd.

   o In Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications'
introduction of equal-access arrangements for competitive carriers has
led to a substantial loss of market for former monopoly Kokusai Denshin Denwa.


   To some extent, these initiatives reflect different priorities. The
principal concern of the FCC is to reduce the telecoms portion of the U.S.
trade deficit. The European Commission is attempting to foster a
Europe-wide telecoms space before the opening of the single market
post-1992. Oftel and Japan's MPT are looking to increase
competition in their markets.

   But behind them all is an economic dynamic that can no longer be
denied.

   The dramatic growth in international telecoms traffic during the 1980s and
the impact of new technology are driving the industry toward new regulatory
arrangements on tariffs, accounting rates and leased lines.

   Already, the line of resistance against sweeping price reductions on
international tariffs is proving impossible to hold. And the expected
bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on
international resale would place intense pressure on Europe's
monopoly operators to follow the same course.

   Overall, however, the present situation is inherently unstable and the
balance between an orderly transition and a market free-for-all is
looking increasingly fragile.

   On the one hand, it invites the abuse of monopoly power; on the other,
price cutting and uneconomic entry by new competitors that may impair
long-term industry investment.

   Multilateral reform of the present system, although preferable, will likely
take years. Meantime, the instability that has become the hallmark of
today's telecoms industry will continue to hold sway and progress
will be made primarily through bilateral agreements.

PERSPECTIVE -- Break Down Barriers

    By COLIN LONG

         Current national rules in all European countries other than the
United Kingdom and Germany will usually serve to prevent value-added
services from being retailed to end-users.

   In an era when most of the talk is of liberalization and of European
Commission initiatives to open up telecommunications markets, this might seem
surprising, but the reasons are simple.

    Under the cloak of national rules and international recommendations
preventing the use of leased circuits for the simple transport of data, such
services are treated as an infringement of the telecoms
administration's local monopoly and therefore are prohibited.

   Only where a substantial value-added service element can be
demonstrated will the ban normally be avoided.

   Even the Commission's recent directive on competition in telecoms
services may not get to grips with this problem. The Commission has accepted
that leased lines should be treated as a special case and that telecoms
administrations should not be obliged to allow simple resale services until
1993 at the earliest.

   The Commission definition of ``simple resale'' is the provision of data
transmission over leased lines as a ``separate service,'' including such
switching, data storage and protocol conversion as is necessary for
transmission in real time to and from the public switched network.

   This rather vague definition begs the question as to the status of a
bundled value-added or managed data network service. It may also differ
markedly from the comparative approach in individual member states.

   While messages may not currently be transmissible over privately operated
data communication networks with public connections, one message is
clear: Anyone offering an international managed data network service and
the benefits of one-stop shopping will have to be prepared to take on the
more recalcitrant telecoms administrations and use European treaty competition
rules and the European Commission to help break down the barriers.

   The real effects of the Commission's service directive may be
some years away. Meantime, these competition rules could accelerate
deregulation.

   In particular, once telecoms administrations begin to cooperate to provide
one-stop managed services, it will be difficult to prevent
non-telecoms administration service providers seeking the same
arrangements.

FACILITIES MANAGEMENT COMPETITION ON RISE -- New
Carrier-Industry Force

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

         LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM-The French and Belgian
telecoms administrations and datacoms equipment manufacturer Groupe Telinfo SA
have formed a company to offer international facilities management
services.

   The company, called Eftel SA, underscores the developing competition for
lucrative facilities management business between Europe's
telecommunications administrations and traditional value-added network
service providers, such as Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS).

   Facilities management embraces everything from purchasing all of a
customer's computing and networking operations, including the staffs
that run them, to monitoring the traffic on a customer's network to
make sure it is configured properly.

   The main activities of Eftel, based in Louvain-la-Neuve, a suburb
of Brussels, will be consultancy and engineering services and network
operation in the form of facilities management or value-added
networks.

   Eftel partner France Cables et Radio, a unit of France Telecom, has
experience in consultancy and engineering. Besides basic telephony,
Belgium's Regie des Telegraphes et Telephones (RTT)
provides communications services such as packet-switched data and
integrated services digital networks.

   Studies show that 20 percent to 30 percent of European communications users
would consider letting a third party run their network.

   ``I see battles looming between major players in facilities management
without a PTT member, and those PTTs who have taken the bit between the
teeth directly or indirectly through a technically based company,'' said
Roger Barber, manager of the telecommunications forum at the Butler Cox
Foundation, in London.

   British Telecom recently announced its intention to offer global facilities
management services through its BT Tymnet Inc. unit, bringing it into
competition with other European telecoms administration in their home
markets.

   In the case of Eftel, Barber said, ``a very powerful company has
been created which taps the resources of the PTTs and the resources of Telinfo
itself.''

   Telinfo, based in Brussels, was formed in August from the merger earlier in
the year of Telindus SA, a Brussels-based manufacturer of modems and
multiplexers, and Informabel, a Belgian systems integrator (see
box).

   Telinfo general manager Jean-Marie Polet said Eftel gives his company,
which already has a close supplier relationship with the RTT, immediate access
to the international customer base of the Belgian and French telecoms
administrations.

CUSTOMERS LINED UP

   The joint-venture company's first customers are Citicorp
Luxembourg, which awarded Eftel a contract to upgrade its existing networks,
and the Belgian National Bank, which has asked Eftel to evaluate tenders for a
local area network installation in the bank's offices.

   Eftel's current business is mostly in Belgium but the company is
hoping to expand internationally.

   Eftel general manager Daniel Brismee said the company wants to build an
organization like SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunications, a consortium that links banks and other financial
institutions worldwide. Eftel wants to work with industry-specific groups
to build up specialized international VANs, he said.

   If Eftel concentrates on specialized business sectors, Butler
Cox's Barber said, it should be better positioned than other VANS
providers, such as EDS. The alliance of public network operators with
equipment suppliers puts them in a position of strength, he said.

   ``This is an important marketing tool in the armory of the PTT
marketeers,'' Barber said. ``Now they can say, `We can provide you with
the lines and the services and run them for you.' But this implies a
greater understanding of business requirements than PTTs have classically
demonstrated.''

   But because public network operators generally have difficulty getting
close to user needs, Barber said, Eftel could turn out to be a
``technically sound company without a great deal of business
acumen.''

Merger Is Part Of Industry Trend

    By Jennifer L. Schenker

         The merger in Belgium of modem and multiplexer manufacturer Telindus
SA with information technology company Informabel SA reflects the European
trend toward computer-communications alliances.

   The merger of Telindus and Informabel formed Groupe Telinfo SA, which
offers data communications and computer applications products and develops and
manages network solutions, said Jean-Marie Polet, Telinfo general
manager.

   He said the company's strength over competing software houses and
telecoms equipment manufacturers is its ability to offer customers complete
computer and communications solutions.

   Such user demand has led to similar mergers, said Richard Mitchell, an
industry analyst at Dataquest Ltd., of Denham, England.

   For example, London-based Psion plc, a maker of hand-held computer
terminals, formally merged with London communications company Dacom
Systems Ltd. and became Psion Dacom plc last month. Similarly, the
Chippenham, England, information technology division of diversified
aerospace company Dowty Group plc acquired the Danish local area network
systems company Dataco AS in June of this year.

   ``I think corporate users expect to see and like to have one-stop
shopping,'' Mitchell said. Invitations to tender cover modems, X.25 packet
switches and a host of computer-related items, meaning the pressure is on
companies to offer expertise in many areas.

   ``If a company can provide only 70 percent of the contract and
somebody else can do all of it, and take into account maintenance of the whole
thing, it is obvious who is going to come out ahead,''
Mitchell said.

   Telindus, which has expertise in wide area networks, local area networks
and message handling systems, has subsidiaries throughout Europe and is
present in both the Asia-Pacific region and the United States.

   Informabel, a software provider with competence centers for different
computer environments and for specialized business sectors such as banking and
industry, has subsidiaries in France, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Morocco and
Tunisia. It is setting up subsidiaries in four more European countries, as
well as Zaire and Brazil.

   The merged company, Telinfo, is concentrating on business opportunities in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

   It is also vying for contracts to provide the Portuguese telecommunications
administration with multiplexers and controlling software for a new digital
network, general manager Polet said.

Germany Offers ISDN Incentives

    By John Blau

         BONN-Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, looking to stimulate demand
for its nationwide ISDN, has launched an incentive program that includes
bonuses for first-time users.

   From 1 October to 31 December, the German network operator is offering the
following bonuses:

   o DM 444 ($300) for basic rate access with call-transfer and at least
one ISDN telephone;

   o DM 888 ($600) for basic rate access with call-transfer, an ISDN
telephone, in addition to access to the analog cellular telephone or
paging networks and a videotex connection;

   o DM 888 for basic rate access with four ISDN telephones and one
terminal adapter or an ISDN teletex terminal; and

   o DM 2,000 for users of existing or new ISDN-capable PBX units
with one or more interfaces.

   The four-part program comes on the heels of DBP Telekom's
promotion of ISDN PC adapter cards, aimed at achieving mass-market
penetration of ISDN services.

   Since April, those in Germany that sign up for basic rate access and also
buy a PC card are given a DM 888 credit on their phone bill.

   The German network operator retreated from its plan to distribute free
cards last year after drawing sharp criticism from the industry, which viewed
the free promotion as anti-competitive.

   DBP Telekom has also been stimulating interest in ISDN by developing
applications with German companies.

French Look At Audiotex

    By Anne-Marie Roussel

         PARIS-Responding to pressure from French audiotex phone-service
providers, France Telecom has created a new audiotex division, whose
director, Jean-Paul Maury, will recommend changes in 18 months for
promoting the industry.

   Maury is considered the father of France's Minitel videotex
system.

   Service providers have argued that France Telecom's tariff and
access rules for audiotex hamper development of their phone services. Audiotex
is most commonly used in France for banking, making reservations, placing bets
and ordering goods from catalogs.

   Basic audiotex services deliver taped messages, while more sophisticated
versions establish a dialog between a caller and a voice-activated
computer.

   Aftel, the French association of audiotex providers, wants France Telecom
to make its tariff structure more flexible and its policy for obtaining lines
less bureaucratic.

   In a recently published white paper, Aftel says the only two tariff options
France Telecom makes available are toll-free numbers and
semi-toll-free numbers (whereby the cost is equally shared by
the caller and the service provider). Aftel would prefer more
options.

   In addition, because the application process is bottlenecked, no new lines
have been made available, said Aftel president Jean-Luc Lenart.

   France Telecom intends to develop audiotex cautiously, said Jean-Claude
Mailhan, director of commercial and telematic affairs. He said the French
operator wants to avoid repeating its videotex experience-whose rapid
growth spurred the proliferation of pornographic services over Minitel.

HONG KONG OFFICIALS LOOK TO FUTURE -- Telecoms Views
Mixed

    By ROBERT POE

         HONG KONG

   Telecoms officials and users in Hong Kong disagree sharply over the
territory's future as a regional communications hub.

   Top-level officials with the territory's dominant telecommunications
operator and regulatory body say the prospects for Hong Kong continuing as
Asia's main communications hub could not be brighter. But according to one
major user, the British colony's return to Chinese control on 1 July 1997
presents potentially enormous problems, and Hong Kong may already be
losing its regional telecoms edge.

   ``As far as we are concerned, it is just another date,'' said Mike
Gale, chief executive of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. ``It should
continue as it does today. It's a change of sovereignty, but in terms of
the ability to come and go, of currency, of free trade and so on, it'll
continue just as it is today.''

   Although China International Trust & Investment Corp. owns 20
percent of Hong Kong Telecom, the Chinese government institution does not take
an active management role, Gale said.

   Postmaster general Dominic Wong, who is in charge of both postal and
telecommunications regulation in the territory, agreed with Gale's
assessment. ``It [1997] is still a political date as such,'' he said. ``In
terms of our planning and expectations, it has never featured in a very
significant way.''

   Users are not reassured, however. ``If you have a company that
has its telecoms hub in Hong Kong, if you've got everything running
out of Hong Kong, as a lot of companies have, then if the Chinese decide to
march into Hong Kong and shut it down in 1997, the company would go out of
business,'' said David Manion, communications manager for
Asia at Reuters South East Asia Ltd., in Hong Kong.

   Although few are convinced this will happen, Manion said, failing to guard
against the possibility means ``gambling the whole of your Asian
business.''

POLITICAL RISK

   Manion, who is head of the Hong Kong Telecommunications Users Group, said
most major communications users are giving at least some consideration to
moving facilities elsewhere.

   The political risk is one reason Reuters moved a major telecoms
technical center to Tokyo. ``You can leave people here, because they can
get on the next plane,'' Manion said, ``but as far as physical facilities,
you have to look at diversifying.''

   Another reason for the move was what Reuters perceived as a decline in
Hong Kong's competitive advantage as a strategic telecoms location-the
result, according to Manion, of modernization by other nations in the
region.

   ``Hong Kong was until a few years ago without question the
telecommunications center of the Asia-Pacific,'' he said. ``But over the
last few years they haven't moved. The rest of the region has, and they've
started to catch up, and in some cases they've overtaken them. I think
Singapore has overtaken Hong Kong. They're building up their advantage all
the time.''

   Hong Kong Telecom's Gale disagrees, noting that 60 percent of the
company's phone calls now go through digital exchanges. All
exchanges are to be digital by 1994. ``I don't think there
are many places that can match that,'' he said.

   Gale said Hong Kong Telecom will spend about HK $3 billion (US
$385 million) both this year and next to expand and modernize.

   Furthermore, Hong Kong is ahead of Singapore in setting up international
communications over undersea optical fiber cables, he said. ``A
customer now who's looking for a fiber optic link to Europe or the
United States can get it out of Hong Kong today,'' Gale
said. Singapore has no fiber optic cables operational for international
telecoms service, he said.

   But this advantage will not last for long, Reuters' Manion noted. The
SEA-ME-WE-2 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) cable, stretching
from Singapore to Marseille, France, is expected to be operational by
1994.

   ``That's got to be important,'' Manion said. ``By then they will have
the whole network linked along the Pacific Rim. The ideal choice would be
one route [in each direction]. Total diversity is the name of the game.''

GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGE

   Another Hong Kong advantage, according to Gale, is geographic. Besides its
position as a gateway to China-``the great potential market of
the future''-Hong Kong is also more central to the
Far East as a whole, he said.

   The advantages of location, however, are being eroded or perhaps even
negated by other developments in the region, according to Manion.
``Before, when there was only one position used as a hub, Hong Kong was
always very well positioned,'' he said. ``But now Tokyo is offering itself
as a hub, and it's got a lot going for it, because the first fiber cables
across the Pacific are based in Tokyo, and because of prices.''

   Prices on international routes out of Japan have dropped substantially
since the introduction of competition in October 1989-Reuters' second
major reason, other than the politics of 1997, for moving its technical
center to Tokyo. ``We believe that where it exists, competition must make
the environment more friendly to the user,'' Manion said.

   Tokyo's problem is its geographic position at the top end of the
Asia-Pacific region, Manion said, the solution to which is to have a
smaller hub farther down.

   ``If you put it in Hong Kong, it's only one stop down the road,'' he
said. ``But if it's in Singapore, it's very well positioned geographically
to serve all of Southeast Asia. So if you go for this sort of diverse
hubs, Hong Kong seems to fall between them. It seems to be caught in a
trap.''

UNDENIABLE ADVANTAGE

   But Manion added that the colony does have one undeniable advantage over
both Singapore and Tokyo: experience, which helps when it comes to
sorting out problems on the other end of the network connection.

   One of Reuters' major problems is getting the Japanese to deal
internationally rather than just looking after themselves. ``They haven't
really caught onto the game they're supposed to play,'' Manion said. ``If
there's a problem somewhere at the other end, they tend to report it to
the other end, and then sit back and say `that's my job done.' ''

   Corporate telecoms managers can be certain, as they ponder Hong Kong's
future as a communications hub, that their decisions will not come easily.
``Hong Kong's a great place,'' Manion said. ``Nobody wants to leave it.
But you have to assess the risks and take reasonable precautions if you're
a responsible businessman.''

Nynex Breakup Considered -- Agency Suggests Divesting
Phone Company Unit

    By DAWN BUSHAUS

         NEW YORK-The New York Public Service Commission, reacting to
alleged business improprieties at Nynex Corp., is investigating the structure
of the Bell company and the possibility of divesting its New York Telephone
Co. subsidiary.

   The New York PSC is the first U.S. state regulatory commission to look at
divesting a Bell operating company from its regional holding company
parent.

   The decision came at the suggestion of William Cowan, the commission's
general counsel, in a report issued this month examining alleged Nynex
business improprieties in Florida.

   Lawrence Friedman, former vice president of purchasing at Nynex Materiel
Enterprises Co. (MECO), was fired in 1988 for his reported role in
organizing Florida parties at which officials allegedly brought prostitutes
for suppliers and took part in other questionable business practices.

   In his report, Cowan said the alleged improprieties, combined with earlier
allegations that MECO had overcharged Nynex's two operating
companies, are reasons to consider divesting New York Telephone.

   Nynex chairman William Ferguson said the company will cooperate with
the PSC investigation, but said divestiture of New York Telephone ``is not
an option.'' A company spokesman said Nynex would challenge a divestiture
order in court.

   Most users said they do not believe a divestiture of New York Telephone
from Nynex will solve any problems.

   ``I think the whole situation-the regulated side buying from the
unregulated side-needs closer auditing, but I don't necessarily believe
divestiture is the answer,'' said Ronald Kopitowski, telecoms director at
the Metropolitan Transit Authority and president of the Communications
Managers Association.

   ``The user community wants good service in a stable environment,'' said
Henry Levine, partner with Morrison & Foerster, a Washington law firm that
represents several large communications users in the financial-services
industry. ``If divestiture would advance that, then users would give it
their support, but if it would retard that, they likely would not support
it.''

   In a related matter, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and
Nynex reached an agreement this month resolving FCC allegations that
Nynex's unregulated MECO unit had excessively charged the regulated New
York Telephone and New England Telephone & Telegraph Co. units for
equipment and services. The overcharging was alleged to have occurred from
1984 to 1988 as part of a scam to pad Nynex profits.

   The two Nynex operating units have agreed to cut interstate access rates by
$35.5 million and pay the U.S. Treasury $1.4 million. In return,
the commission will drop a proceeding against the two companies without
concluding that they violated FCC rules.

   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, which
regulates New England Telephone, will keep a close eye on the New York PSC
investigation, said Susan Tierney, a DPU commissioner. The DPU has ordered an
audit of transactions between New England Telephone and MECO.

HIGH-SPEED AHEAD FOR US SPRINT, MCI -- Carriers
Emphasize Data

    By ROBIN GAREISS

         SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA-Communications users with applications
that demand high-speed data transmission welcomed this month's
announcements by US Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications Corp.

   US Sprint is the first U.S. long distance carrier to disclose plans to
provide a frame-relay service, aimed at satisfying growing user demand
for high-speed packet switching.

   Meanwhile, rival MCI unveiled a family of high-speed data services
that initially will give users access to T1 and DS-3 circuits on an
as-needed basis.

   Both carriers made their announcements at the Tele-Communications
Association's conference in San Diego this month.

   US Sprint said it will offer a frame-relay service late next year. The
initial rollout will provide only data services.

   Frame relay-a faster method of packet switching-can transmit
information at the T1 speed of 1.544 megabits per second. But unlike X.25, it
does not offer error correction, switched virtual connections or access
control. X.25 switches at lower speeds, however.

   As a public network operator, US Sprint will provide the link for users
who want to build hybrid private-public networks. US Sprint's frame-relay
network is intended to complement the SprintNet X.25 packet switching data
network. Ultimately, frame relay will provide access to broadband network
services.

   ``Overall, Sprint is setting itself up in this bandwidth-on-demand
marketplace as a leader,'' said Berge Ayvazian, an analyst at The Yankee
Group, in Boston. He said he expects MCI to announce a frame-relay service
based on Northern Telecom Ltd. technology.

   Although specific pricing is not yet available, it is expected that US
Sprint will charge users a fixed rate with usage-based charges for peak
periods.

   US Sprint's fiber optic network and Telenet Processor/III 4900
packet switches will support the system. US Sprint will use Integrated Packet
Exchange switches from StrataCom Inc. and market them as US Sprint's
TP7900 packet-based multiplexers for future voice, video and data
applications.

   US Sprint officials said users have not demanded frame-relay voice
services, so the initial rollout will contain only data components. In later
phases of frame relay, US Sprint will offer voice and video services, said
Floyd Trogdon, senior vice president at US Sprint Data Group.

      The frame-relay service initially will be available in the United
States, Japan and the United Kingdom and later extended to other European
countries.

MCI OFFERING

   MCI's Initial Virtual Private Data Service offerings will let
users transmit data at switched T1 and DS-3 (45-mbps)
speeds.

   The service, which will not be generally available until mid-1991,
marks the first time switched T1 and switched DS-3 are available through
a high-speed, virtual private network, MCI officials said. MCI will
devote a portion of its public network to VPDS offerings.

   AT&T has not dedicated a portion of its network to its virtual
private data network, the Software Defined Data Network. And the highest speed
AT&T has committed to with SDDN is 384 kilobits per second.

   Many communications managers at the largest U.S. companies want switched T1
services, especially for cases where they transmit heavy amounts of digital
traffic on an irregular basis, such as for videoconferencing.

   ``We cannot afford the dedicated facilities to handle full-motion
video,'' said Ed Forhan, communications manager at The Walker Group, a
chain of retail stores based in Westminster, Colorado. ``Any service that
gives small companies the ability to have video service is a big
benefit.''

   MCI must still determine which switching and billing systems it will use
with the VPDS.

   Some analysts questioned the timing of the announcement because MCI could
not provide detailed plans for the service's implementation.

FCC Gets Input On PCN Proposals

    By KATHLEEN KILLETTE

         WASHINGTON-Personal communications services are natural
extensions of cellular technology and so the United States must let the
cellular industry take the lead in introducing them, according to many of the
comments submitted this month to the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission.

   The FCC began an inquiry in June into PCS-the American term for
personal communications network (PCN) services. In its inquiry, the
FCC sought comments on the amount of spectrum needed for PCS, the types of
technologies that should be given priority, the technical standards that
should govern PCS and the degree to which providers should be regulated.

   The FCC also proposed excluding telephone companies and cellular mobile
radio licensees from providing PCS in areas they already serve, to ensure that
the fledgling market is open to entrepreneurs.

   Telephone companies and mobile service providers disagreed with that
proposal. ``The exclusion of these qualified participants would
needlessly limit the availability of PCS,'' stated GTE
Service Corp.

   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association said the cellular
industry already offers efficient, affordable, lightweight, two-way
personal communications services via portable cellular phones, and that
several cellular companies are poised to initiate PCS trials.

   Those experiments, the CTIA stated, should lay the groundwork for the FCC
in measuring the need for PCS spectrum.

`DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL'

   Nynex Corp. agreed, adding that the FCC ``should recognize that
any distinction between cellular and PCS would be highly artificial and that
the success of the cellular operations in the 800- to 900-megahertz
range should not be `truncated' by allotting too many resources
to PCS development.''

   Nynex plans to introduce the first wireless Personal Telephone Service
early next year in New York City.

   Telocator, a Washington-based association that represents paging and
cellular companies, opposed the FCC's proposal to use spectrum now
reserved for advanced paging frequencies-in the 930- to 931-MHz
range-for PCS.

   Manufacturers also weighed in on the PCS issue. Northern Telecom Inc.
stated as top priorities the establishment of a common numbering plan,
fostering network interoperability and efficient bandwidth utilization, and
prevention of interference. It proposed an open standard-called personal
communications interface (PCI)-for low-power, wireless
PCS.

   PCI, based on the CT2 standards being considered in Canada, would rely on
two-way communications channels and separate common channels for call
setup signaling. This approach would use bandwidth more efficiently, and give
users faster call setups and longer battery life for portable cellular phones,
Northern said.

   Apple Computer Inc. noted that the PCS proposals presented to the FCC have
focused mainly on voice communications, and recommended the allocation of
spectrum to ``Data-PCS.''

   Apple proposed allocating frequencies in the 1.7- to 2.3-gigahertz band
to be used exclusively for high-speed data communications within office
buildings, linking laptop computers via low-power transmitters.

Fujitsu Boosting U.S. Switch Effort

    By ROBERT POE

         RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA-Fujitsu Ltd. is boosting efforts to
adapt its digital exchange to the U.S. network, in anticipation of the
$40 billion public switch changeout expected to take place in the
United States over the next 10 to 15 years.

   Fujitsu plans to increase the number of U.S. staffers in charge of selling
and engineering the Fetex-150 switch to 600 by 1994 from the current 100,
company officials in Tokyo said.

   The increase will shift development of sophisticated switch features to the
United States from Japan, said one observer familiar with the
Raleigh-based subsidiary.

   Officials at Fujitsu Network Switching of America Inc. disclosed few
details.

   Most of the current staff there are working on testing the performance and
network conformance of software developed in Japan, the observer said. With
the expansion, the subsidiary will take on responsibility for developing
functions and capabilities required by U.S. customers.

   The Fetex-150 is Fujitsu's export-model exchange switch, with more than
8.8 million lines installed or on order in 17 countries. None have been
sold in the United States, but the recently announced plans confirm
longstanding speculation that the Japanese manufacturer is planning a
major push into the U.S. market.

   When Fujitsu won a major switch tender in Singapore last autumn,
competitors complained the company was selling the equipment at cost to win a
prestigious contract that would serve as a stepping stone to the U.S.
market.

   Fujitsu said its switch has passed Phase 1 and 2 evaluations by Bell
Communications Research Inc., the research arm of the seven U.S. Bell
companies.

   Although the certification is considered essential to selling to the
Bells-which account for about 75 percent of U.S. telephone lines-it
may not be enough for Fujitsu to break into a market dominated by
AT&T and Northern Telecom Inc.

   The two manufacturers have more than 90 percent of the U.S. market. A share
like that, coupled with Bell company inertia in changing to new suppliers,
leaves foreign public switch manufacturers largely out in the cold, analysts
say.

   The U.S. subsidiaries of Siemens AG, L.M. Ericsson, NEC Corp. and GEC
Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. have found the U.S. market tough to crack,
though each has had limited success and are further along than Fujitsu.

   ``There's an inherent conservatism on the part of their [U.S.] customer
base,'' said Robert Rosenberg, director of analytical services at The
Eastern Management Group, in Parsippany, New Jersey. ``These are huge
companies with billions of dollars invested in their current equipment.

   ``Even if Fujitsu comes up with a switch that has all the bells
and whistles that an engineer could ever want, if all the support systems have
to be rebuilt in order to fit that switch into the network, his manager
won't let him install it,'' according to
Rosenberg.

First Telmex Bidders Step Forward

    By DAVID ROCKS

         MEXICO CITY-U.S. Bell company Nynex Corp. and
Canada's BCE Inc. have teamed with a Mexican partner to bid for
operating control of Mexico's telephone network.

   The two companies plan to join Casa de Bolsa Inverlat Associates, a Mexican
investment group, in their bid for Telefonos de Mexico SA.

   The Mexican government plans to sell its 20.4 percent controlling interest
in Telmex, with bids due 15 November. Although several groups are expected to
tender offers, the Nynex-BCE-Inverlat consortium is the first to go
public with its intentions.

   Telmex, with some 5.5 million access lines in a country of 88 million
people, is a highly profitable monopoly and is considered to have enormous
growth potential.

   The winning bidder will, however, face a daunting task in upgrading service
and modernizing the network, much of which dates to the 1960s.

   ``There is a lot of room for improvement in their service,'' said
Eugene LaBorne, a Nynex International official working in Mexico City to
put the bid together. For example, he said, some 1.2 million people are
waiting to have a telephone installed.

   Forty percent of Telmex stock consists of voting shares. The Mexican
government now controls 51 percent of those shares, while the rest of the
company is held by private investors.

OWNERSHIP DETAILS

   The government is seeking to sell its stake-20.4 percent of the
total-to an investment group controlled by Mexicans.

   Inverlat will control 51 percent of the consortium, while BCE and Nynex
will likely split the balance, LaBorne said.

   Representatives of BCE, the Canadian telecoms holding company that includes
Bell Canada and Northern Telecom Ltd., and Nynex, which provides New York and
New England with phone service, are in Mexico working out the details of the
bid, LaBorne said.

   The market value of Telmex stock is about $7 billion, so the 20.4
percent stake for sale should fetch about $1.4 billion.

   Laborne said the government's selection will likely hinge as much
on each bidder's service and network-improvement plan as on the
cash offered.

   As a U.S. Bell company, Nynex will face regulatory impediments should its
consortium be selected. The AT&T divestiture agreement prohibits the
Bells from carrying long distance phone traffic in the United States, which
means Nynex would not be allowed to handle U.S.-bound calls from
Telmex-the bulk of the company's international business.

   Nynex believes the problem is surmountable, LaBorne said.

   There is some precedent for a waiver of the rule. Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Ameritech, Bell companies that recently bought a stake in Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand, have been allowed to participate in Telecom's
U.S.-bound calling business.

UNIVERSITY PLOTS BROADBAND NET -- Fiber To
Cambridge

    By MALCOLM LAWS

         CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND

   Next summer the medieval architecture of Cambridge will be networked by
one of Europe's most advanced broadband fiber optic communications
systems, thanks to Cambridge University.

   The 2.5 million ($4.7 million) Granta Backbone Network will offer
voice, data, image and video transmission for staff and students at 79
sites, most of which comprise the 31 semi-autonomous colleges that make up
the university.

   Because the university is spread throughout the city, lacking a central
campus, it was granted a special telecoms license by the Department of Trade
and Industry that allows it to lay its own lines for private voice and data
communications.

   A forthcoming government telecoms duopoly review could open the way for
Cambridge to sell commercial services, but the university would not speculate
on what might be possible.

   The GBN is part of Project Granta, a fourfold computing strategy approved
by the colleges in October 1987. The strategy comprises the University
Network, the mainframe, distributed computing and personal computer
systems.

   The colleges agreed on an outline for the backbone network in early 1989.
Implementation will start next month and is due to be completed by June. STC
plc's cable products division is to build the network.

   The GBN has been designed with a mix of present and future industrial,
social and educational needs in mind, according to the university.
Although regulations limit GBN use to within the university and its
various agencies, such as the Cambridge University Press and the local
schools examination board, ``if it were legal, decent and honest, we'd do
anything,'' said David Hartley, director of the University Computing
Service for 20 years.

   In anticipation of new services GBN has ``sufficient spare
capacity for increased and new forms of communication traffic where
needed,'' Hartley said.

   A copper coaxial cable and three types of fiber-62.5-micron and
50-micron multimode and a very-high-capacity 8-micron
monomode-will be laid in one duct and there are two more empty ducts.

   The copper cable will replace the digital leased lines now used for the
university's private X.25 network, linking more than 100 Ethernet
segments and for the private PBX voice network. Hartley estimates the GBN will
immediately save the university 70,000 a year just in replacing the leased
lines used for data.

   Uses for the various fibers have been left open. At first the 62.5
micron U.S.-standard fiber may support the 100-megabit-per-second fiber
distributed data interface local network technology, shortly to be
ratified by the American National Standards Institute. The 50-micron fiber
will carry Ethernet.

   Both may later support 140-mbps dual queue, dual bus metropolitan area
networking, for voice, data and video, once the standard has been finalized.
The 50-micron fiber, standard in Europe and Japan, has been chosen to
support applications that are still being researched, at Cambridge and
elsewhere.

   The 10-gigahertz bandwidth of the 8-micron fiber is so great that
even high-quality video could not fill it, said Andy Lawrence, director
of project analysis at Cambridge consultancy Improcom Ltd., which helped
design GBN. It has been installed in anticipation of applications several
years away.

`ASKING FOR THE MOON'

   In the short term the GBN could be used to carry satellite TV signals
received by the audio-visual services department.

    Lawrence said that what the university wanted ``was a bit like asking
for the moon,'' since, in Hartley's words, it needed a ``low-tech,
low-risk, long-term'' infrastructure. The dark fiber itself is seen as low
technology; it is the networking technology running over it that is high
tech.

   To save money, the bulk of which will be spent simply on laying cable, the
university's network will share duct space with the Cambridge cable
TV company. However, regulations do not allow the two to share cables. As much
of the ducting as possible will run across university land.

   Hartley emphasized that Project Granta is different from such ventures as
Project Athena at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which aims to
develop computer systems themselves.

   Instead, Granta is an exercise in how to manage corporate information
systems. Its infrastructure will provide both general and specific
applications, from electronic mail to communications for advanced molecular
biology.

Stanford To Join Med Net

    Stanford University, of Palo Alto, California, has signaled its intention
to participate in a medical school network that will link a group of
universities using the ISDN primary rate interface. Stanford joins Duke
University, Johns Hopkins Health Systems and Harvard University, which have
been negotiating with a number of long distance companies to use ISDN to link
the medical schools of each campus.

   The North American primary rate interface specifies 23 bearer channels and
one signaling channel, all operating at 64 kilobits per second. It provides
bandwidth equivalent to the T1 speed of 1.544 megabits per second, giving the
institutions the flexibility to transmit data, image and video. Image
transmission appears to have the most potent application in the med school
network.

   ``There's a great need internally and externally for each institution
to move radiographic images back and forth'' between offices and storage,
said Norman Sefton, assistant business manager and director of
communications at Duke, in Durham, North Carolina.

   Managing the X-ray database is a tremendous physical problem, Sefton
said. ``It would be nice if we could handle them like a jukebox-just call
them up and share the stored image for consultations or other uses,'' he
said.

First Union Banks On VSATs

    First Union Corp. has replaced its leased-line network with a
multimillion-dollar Ku-band satellite network that the bank expects
will help it save $4 million in communications costs over the next five
years.

   The very small aperture terminal network includes 646 earth stations that
link 723 bank sites.

   The company, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has bank branches and
business offices in 36 U.S. states. The network will carry all the
bank's data communications traffic, including that generated by its
automated teller machines. First Union also runs its network security alarms
on the VSAT network.

   The bank's voice traffic will remain on virtual-network
circuits provided by US Sprint Communications Co. and AT&T, said
George Mattingly, vice president and director of telecommunications at First
Union.

Forecast Calls For Ethernet

    The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, in Reading,
England, is to install a high-capacity Ethernet local area network later
this year to increase the accurancy of its daily forecasts.

   The organization produces weather reports for 18 European countries, using
a numerical model of the atmosphere.

   The new local area network, to be supplied by Untra Network Technologies,
of San Jose, California, will add to the ECMWF's existing Cray
Research Inc. supercomputer and its IBM 3090 mainframe. The organization said
it needs 1-gigabit-per-second data traffic capacity to match
data files of gigabyte size with giga-flop processor performance in a
distributed environment.

Developer Lures Business With Fiber

    By DAWN BUSHAUS

         DAKOTA DUNES, SOUTH DAKOTA-A real estate developer is counting
on a fiber optic communications network, coupled with a buyers'
market and a scenic environment, to lure communications-intensive
businesses to the self-contained city it is developing in Dakota
Dunes.

   Many developers and telephone companies across the United States are
experimenting with deploying fiber to businesses and homes. Dozens of
fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-curb trials are under way, and
businesses are beginning to demand services, such as videoconferencing and
high-speed data transmission, that are delivered best over the medium.

   Dakota Dunes Development Co., a division of Midwest Capital Group Inc., of
Sioux City, Iowa, is developing this 2,000-acre community at the
convergence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers, near Sioux City. It will
feature 1,600 residential units, a 216-acre business park, an
18-hole golf course and a $1.8 million fiber network.

   The Dakota Dunes project, which originated two years ago, is expected to
take 15 years to complete. The developer is targeting credit card, insurance,
computer and other communications-intensive companies as potential new
businesses for the community, said Glenn Ivarsen, manager of economic
development at Dakota Dunes Development. About 5,000 jobs can be created in
the business complex, he said.

   U S West Inc., of Englewood, Colorado, soon will begin deploying the fiber
optic network that will provide telecommunications service to the businesses
and residences in Dakota Dunes.

FIBER IN EVERY BUILDING

   ``We will be bringing fiber to every corporate hub site in each
new building, and we will also be bringing fiber to the curb for the
residences,'' said Don Faber, service manager for large
business services at U S West. ``We'll be letting bids
soon because we have to have fiber in to serve the first business
customer.''

   That first customer, Financial Reserve Corp., an East Haven,
Connecticut-based credit card company that targets college markets, is
expected to set up shop early next year.

   Keith Eaton, vice president of management information systems at Financial
Reserve, said the fiber network, along with the tax breaks offered in South
Dakota, played a role in the company's decision to locate an office
in Dakota Dunes.

   The site will support customer-service and collection operations,
which will require heavy use of both voice and data communications, Eaton
said. The company has not yet signed up for any specific telecoms services,
however.

   U S West's Faber said he expects business customers to use the
fiber network for high-speed data services, such as integrated services
digital networks, and for videoconferencing.

   For residential customers, the company initially will offer only plain old
telephone service, he said. Services such as remote meter-reading or
security monitoring may be offered to residential customers in the
future.

Developing World Looks To OSI

    By DAVID ROCKS

         NEW YORK-Though behind in the drive for Open Systems
Interconnection, developing countries face fewer barriers to adopting the
protocols than their industrialized counterparts, some experts say.

   Nearly 20 years after users first began clamoring for interoperability,
products following OSI protocols are finally becoming widely
available-but not so much in the developing world.

   ``OSI products will come, but how soon, we will see,'' said S.
Ramakrishnam of India's Department of Electronics. ``It is important that
we build up momentum with significant involvement by industry and users.''

   Still, once they get around to adopting open systems, developing countries
may face fewer barriers than developed countries, according to Ramakrishnam
and others.

   There may be more resistance to change in Europe, Japan and the United
States, where businesses already have a substantial investment in systems,
than in developing countries, which generally do not have an installed
proprietary base, said Kathy Dally, an OSI consultant with Omnicom Inc., of
Vienna, Virginia.

   Developing countries ``don't have extensive networks,'' Dally said.
``So instead of buying proprietary operations, they would be more likely
to buy the OSI solution.''

CREATING BELIEVERS

   Ramakrishnam said no vendors in his country sell OSI products, although one
of the 11 computer networks in India plans to use OSI protocols.

   The system, called Ernet, is a national network using very small aperture
terminals to link universities and researchers nationwide. Funded by the
United Nations Development Program, one goal of the project was to spur
development of OSI standards in India.

   ``We want to clarify the environment to make it easier for people
to become believers,'' Ramakrishnam said.

    Lincoln Faurer, president of the Corporation for Open Systems
International, a not-for-profit group based in McLean, Virginia,
that advocates OSI solutions, said developing countries-indeed all
countries-could gain more in terms of open systems if they were to put
aside nationalistic goals in favor of internationalism.

   ``Every country wants to spend the money at home to solve the problem
[of interoperability], but they don't have the money to really put a dent
in it,'' Faurer said. Instead of trying to develop indigenous standards,
he said, nations should work with international agencies for a global
solution.

   Such a global solution is a key concern of developing countries,
Ramakrishnam said. With different regions developing their own conception
of OSI, countries that are not part of one region must make a decision
about which regional standard to adopt.

   ``We have to choose between the United States, Japan and Europe,
and we don't like it, so harmonization is very important to
us,'' he said.

   Ironically, because of the untested nature of OSI, if developing countries
lag in its adoption, they might actually come out ahead, said John McConnell,
a networking consultant based in Boulder, Colorado.

   ``Whether OSI is going to work or ever be a commercial success is
something that we won't know for another several
years,'' he said.

Unisys Unveils Open Architecture

    By KELLY JACKSON

         NEW YORK-Unisys Corp. has unveiled a computer architecture for
building distributed networks out of its own and other
manufacturers' products.

   Unisys, of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, assembled its top executives in New
York earlier this month to announce its long-awaited blueprint for
building enterprise networks (CommunicationsWeek International, 17
September).

   The Unisys Architecture unifies the computer manufacturer's
divergent product families and melds them with other vendors'
products using international and de facto networking standards.

   Users and industry analysts hailed the new direction as a milestone.

   ``Unisys' architecture is a real solution. It's tangible and it's going
to prove to be the best option'' for many users, said Dean Sutton,
president of CUBE Inc., of Detroit, a Unisys user group.

   The Unisys Architecture, which includes the spectrum of technologies needed
to construct a multivendor network, also addresses network management. Unisys
officials offered clues to the company's plans for that area.

   James Murtaugh, vice president and general manager at the
company's Information Networking Group, said Unisys has decided to
add Simple Network Management Protocol network management technology to its
future management software under the Unisys Architecture umbrella.

   Next year the company will unveil its software based on the OSI Common
Management Information Protocol, using OSI/Network Management Forum
specifications, he said.

   Unisys officials said the company's architecture emphasizes
standards, not proprietary networking protocols and operating systems.

   While IBM's Systems Application Architecture and Digital
Equipment Corp.'s Network Application Support rely on proprietary
systems as the core architecture, the Unisys architecture provides a clear
migration path from proprietary to open systems, analysts said.

FINANCIAL WOES

   Officials unveiled the architecture about a week after Unisys announced
it would eliminate its 25-cent-per-share dividend-news that sent the
company's stock price plummeting.

   James Unruh, Unisys president and chief executive officer, said the company
will likely show a loss in the third quarter, but return to profitability in
the fourth.

   For the full year, however, Unruh was less sanguine about whether Unisys
will post a profit. He said the volatility of the economy, worsened by the
tenuous situation in the Middle East, makes it impossible to forecast earnings
with any degree of accuracy.

   Financial analysts were wondering if the new architecture would be enough
to offset damage caused by the discontinuation of the company's
dividend.

   Charles Rothchild, an analyst with Pershing & Co., in New York,
said Wall Street greeted the elimination of the dividend with ``a
great deal of disappointment.''

   ``This is a company that has paid a dividend for 95 years,'' he noted.
One day after the 27 September announcement to eliminate dividend payment,
Unisys stock tumbled some 23 percent, to $5.375 per share.

   Candee Wilde contributed to this story.

Novell Offers AS/400 Link

    By Kella Knack

         PROVO, UTAH-Novell Inc. has introduced a token-ring connectivity
option for NetWare, its local area network operating system, that expands
support for IBM Application System/400 midrange computers on NetWare LANs.

   Novell is the first third-party vendor to offer a token-ring
option for IBM equipment. It is being provided in Version 1.3 of NetWare SNA
Gateway Server software and Version 1.2 of NetWare 3270 LAN Workstation client
software.

   Numerous users have asked Novell for connectivity options over the past two
years, said Gerry Machi, director of product marketing at Novell. According to
Bruce Robertson, with Interconnect Network Consulting Group, of Santa Monica,
California, ``people assumed if they had IBM they could not use
Novell.''

   The SNA gateway software turns an IBM Personal System/2 PC into a Systems
Network Architecture gateway server, letting users on a NetWare LAN share a
token-ring link with an IBM 2/3X or AS/400 host. It costs $2,995.
The NetWare 3270 LAN software gives 64 LAN workstations access to up to 64
concurrent terminal/printer sessions on an AS/400. It costs $995.

Business Looks To Video

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         LONDON-Videoconferencing is becoming a more viable business
tool with developing international standards, breakthroughs in microchip
technology and the prospect of falling prices.

   Companies have used videoconferencing primarily for internal meetings.
Products hit the market in the mid-1980s, and there are now about 2,000
corporate studios worldwide, mostly in the United States.

   Norman Gaut, president of videoconference equipment manufacturer PictureTel
Corp., of Peabody, Massachusetts, said the industry has been U.S.-based
mainly because of the comparative price and quality of public networks
elsewhere. But network improvements, including the more widespread
availability of international ISDN, will make the market more global, he
said.

   Trans-Atlantic videoconferences cost several hundred dollars an hour.
They are not even possible between many countries because of a lack of
international public circuit-switched
64-kilobit-per-second services.

   Market growth has also been impeded by a lack of equipment standards, the
high cost of equipment and the large amount of bandwidth required to use
it.

   The transmission of broadcast-quality, full-motion television
pictures in digital form requires bandwidth of about 5.5 megahertz for
transmission speeds of between 90 megabits per second and 100 mbps. But
ordinary public telephone networks are designed to carry relatively
low-quality voice signals, which need only 10 kilobits per second, or a
bandwidth of 3.5 MHz. Therefore, video transmission requires compression.

   Video signals are also analog, which means they must be converted to be
transmitted over digital leased phone lines. The process of converting and
then compressing pictures is carried out by computers called
coder-decoders, or codecs.

   Codecs compress signals to as low as 64 kbps and to the T1 and E1 speeds of
1.544 mbps and 2.048 mbps. As a rule, the greater the bandwidth, the better
the picture quality. But more bandwidth also costs the end user more
money.

   George Newman, an analyst at International Data Corp., in Framingham,
Massachusetts, expects an increasing number of products to operate at around
384 kbps as a compromise between price and quality.

STANDARDS MEAN ACCEPTANCE

   Meanwhile, equipment manufacturers and users alike say standards will help
further the acceptance of products. Current systems are proprietary,
preventing users of one product from communicating with those of another.

   The first step toward standardization should take place in November, when
the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee is due to
ratify the H.261 video compression standard. GEC Plessey Telecommunications
Ltd. and Video Telecom Corp. say they already have compliant products; other
suppliers, such as PictureTel, Harris Video Communication Systems Inc. and
Compression Labs Inc., plan to make their products compliant next year.

   Standards will be applied only in part. H.261 is the video compression
element of a broader Px64 standard, which recommends speech compression for
video transmission at 64 kbps.

   Using so much bandwidth for voice is a waste of bandwidth, and also impairs
video quality. Consequently, many products will compress speech to 16 kbps,
while adhering to the CCITT's video-compression standard.

   Suppliers ultimately want videoconferencing products to be as convenient as
using a simple telephone. Widespread ISDN, which provides dial-up
64-kbps speeds, would facilitate such connectivity, and allow users to
make a video call for the price of a normal phone call.

VIDEOCONFERENCING OVER PC

   Some observers say videoconferencing over personal computers will one day
supplant the need for expensive codecs. Instead of needing special screens and
cameras, conferencing could take place in a PC built with videoconferencing
chips, and a miniature camera mounted on top.

   In August, PictureTel and chip maker Intel Corp. began developing
microprocessors-which will be available to any PC manufacturer-to
allow videoconferencing at the desktop.

   Harris Corp. formed Harris Video Communications in July and rolled out its
PC-based Anamix Personal Communications system, which links to eight
people in different locations. Users are able to simultaneously watch
full-motion images, listen to conversation and share graphics. The APC
costs $85,000 for three units and $200,000 for eight.

   With the system, users need a PC, which can also be supplied by the
company, a camera mounted on the PC, and a microphone/speaker attachment. It
compresses to rates between 64 kbps and 1.544 mbps.

   PictureTel's Gaut said before high-quality PC videoconferencing becomes
a reality, a new generation of chips must be developed. Intel is working
on a chip capable of one billion operations per second, compared to 40
million per second possible with current chips, he said.

   IDC's Newman predicts a mass market for multimedia PCs, carrying
data, graphics, video and speech within five years. The market, he said, will
be spurred by increased PC memory capacity and the availability of more
bandwidth, brought about by extensive deployment of optical fiber in the
public network.

   Video Telecom, of Austin, Texas, claims to have the only videoconferencing
product that already carries graphics and data. Its Conference System, which
costs about $45,000 per user, operates at between 112 kbps and 768 kbps
and can retrieve data from an on-board hard disk so that photographs,
slides and documents can be used as part of a videoconference. VTC supplies
two monitors, one for video, and the other for data, and a tablet that allows
notes or changes to be made to a graphic, seen in real time on the other end
of the videoconference.

   Not all potential users are sold on the concept of videoconferencing over
PCs. Deborah Scholl, assistant vice president of financial services company
First Chicago Corp., maintains that PC screens are too small for large
business meetings.

CUTS TRAVEL EXPENSES

    First Chicago has been using videoconferencing for a year between offices
in Chicago, New York and London. Scholl said the company's 57
conferences have saved it more than $17,500 in travel expenses over the
last five months.

   First Chicago's conferences are transmitted over the public
network at 112 kbps. PictureTel equipment accesses two 56-kbps circuits.
Though most meetings are for internal business or training, the company has
regular conferences with one of its West Coast clients.

   Scholl hopes public operators will offer bridging facilities to allow three
meetings to be linked, currently not possible with its PictureTel equipment.
Conferences involving three or more rooms are possible, but the equipment is
more expensive.

   Many telecoms operators already offer public booths. British Telecom, for
instance, has 11 public videoconferencing centers across the United
Kingdom.

   PictureTel's U.K. distributor held the first videoconference
between the United Kingdom and Australia last month. The video ISDN link was
carried by OTC Ltd., which has just begun international ISDN service to the
United Kingdom.

   Most European telephone operators offer videoconferencing. The first to
offer switched international video services was BT, in conjunction with
Teleglobe Canada Inc. in 1984. BT now offers such services to 17 countries,
and estimates that about 200 U.K. companies use videoconferencing on private
networks.

   Videoconferencing is attracting more attention despite high entry costs for
suppliers, particularly for research. Six year-old PictureTel, for
instance, is a leader in low-bit rate systems but is still unprofitable.
Before long, users will be able to choose from an increasing number of less
expensive products.

   What is unclear, however, is exactly how users will apply video
conferencing-whether with conventional codec-based products or a new
generation of multi-media PCs.

IBM's European Mouthpiece

    By ANNE-MARIE ROUSSEL

         Corporate lobbying of European Commission representatives was an
activity limited to a handful of players only a few years ago-and, at
that time, IBM's Olivier de la Fouchardiere was already a member of
the club.

   Since then, the practice has widened. But because of cultural differences,
professional lobbying is still not as well received in Europe as it is in the
United States.

   ``Lobbying still has a negative connotation in Europe,'' la
Fouchardiere says. Whereas lobbyists are registered professionals in
Washington, they have a more nebulous status in Europe, where the
political clout of special-interest groups or corporations is not
appreciated.

   La Fouchardiere, however, combats the European attitude with bravado:
``I love being called a lobbyist, it's the fun part of my job,'' he says,
adding he likes to use the power behind Big Blue to help shape the course
of politics in Europe.

   ``Coming from IBM, I never had problems getting appointments with top
officials,'' he says. Such influence seems particularly useful, now that
there are signs that the European ways are changing, he says. These days,
when he goes to Brussels to present IBM's viewpoint, ``there are several
hundred lobbyists representing interest groups or corporations waiting to
see officials, where there was no one before.''

   La Fouchardiere has a long history of representing IBM-in various
capacities. After joining the computer manufacturer 25 years ago, the
50-year-old engineer alternated for years between the
company's French subsidiary and IBM Europe, both based in Paris.

   Since last year he has overseen IBM France's standards programs
and its external relations.

   In the standards area, la Fouchardiere directs IBM's research and
development team, located in the southern French town of La Gaude, which works
with such bodies as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI) to develop Europe-wide telecommunications products.

   As director of external relations, he oversees IBM France's
relationship with the French government and the European Community. He
keeps abreast of laws or directives that may affect IBM's business in the
region, and tries to influence the law-making process by lobbying the
right people.

   His current crusade is with the French regulatory body, the Direction a la
Reglementation Generale. The DRG has prepared a draft legislation-to be
debated by the French Parliament this month-to reform the telecoms market
in France (CommunicationsWeek International, 17 September).

   As a potential supplier to possible service providers, IBM would prefer the
market to be as wide-open as possible, la Fouchardiere says.

    But as he sees it, the DRG's proposal needs more work, so he
would like Parliament to amend it.

   ``It's too complicated,'' he says. ``It creates categories of services
that don't exist.''

   These categories, identified in the proposal as ``support services,''
include certain data communication services, such as those offered by
packet-switched network Transpac or the integrated services digital
network. These data services are grouped by the licensing procedure they
require-an arbitrary process, said la Fouchardiere.

   ``There is no objective determination of where the category starts or
ends,'' he says, ``so potential service providers can't know whether they
are within the limits or not.''

   In addition, private datacom operators-which he says should
theoretically compete on equal footing with France Telecom-are actually
not considered on par with the national operator. While the law clearly
defines what private operators can or cannot do, there is no such definition
for France Telecom, giving the impression that France Telecom faces no
restrictions.

   ``If I were a private operator, I would very much like to know what
France Telecom can do to gobble me up,'' la Fouchardiere says. ``If France
Telecom wants to be a competitive market, then it should be submitted to
the same rules as anybody else.''

   Another shortfall of the DRG's law proposal, he argues, is there
is no provision for service providers to be included in the
decision-making process.

-    If la Fouchardiere could achieve one goal in Europe, it would be
this: that pan-European voice and data communications networks
would no longer be subject to geographical barriers.

   ``National frontiers get in my way,'' he says.

IN THE NEWS

    By Malcolm Laws

         3Com Corp. has named Richard Joyce, former managing director of its
U.K. subsidiary, as the company's first European president of 3Com
Europe.

   Effective last week, the new job means the 34-year-old Joyce will
work from the Paris headquarters of 3Com Europe. The first day in his new role
was spent at a networking exhibition in the Soviet Union.

   Joyce, who helped set up the U.K. arm of Bridge Communications Inc. before
it merged with 3Com in 1987, takes over from senior international vice
president John Marman.

   Marman has returned to 3Com corporate headquarters in Santa Clara,
California, after a year spent overseeing the shift in the company's
European organization.

   The European reshuffle got under way in 1989, when a group of 3Com's
General Europe Area management left to form their own company. Soon
afterward, responsibility for the smaller European territories, Africa and
parts of the Middle East-all previously in GEA-passed to the two major
subsidiaries, the United Kingdom and France.

   The non-European countries now come under 3Com Intercontinental and
the smaller European territories have become independent.

   Joyce says one of his next tasks is to open Eastern Europe to
3Com's networking products, hence the early Soviet visit. Tom
Plymouth, recently hired from Digital Equipment Corp., will become the new
U.K. managing director.

International Users Take Command

    By David Gillick And Denis Gilhooly

         Europe's telecommunications administrations remain
oblivious to the fundamental needs of national and international
telecommunications users.

      Inadequate standards, low quality of service, over-regulation,
limited product offerings, inadequate network management, and poor customer
relations are stifling business development across industry sectors, according
to the 1990 CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group International
User Survey.

   But evidence is mounting that the balance of power is finally shifting in
favor of the customer.

   Not surprisingly, the survey finds that users want basic, reliable and
affordable services at competitive prices. What is surprising, however, is
that, increasingly, users regard electronic information exchange-and the
effective inter-networking to allow the exchange to occur-vital to
many of their operations.

   They expect the basics, but they want more.

   Users can no longer afford to be held captive by monopolies reinforced by
outmoded regulatory regimes. To be competitive in a global marketplace their
needs must come first. Otherwise, like users in the United States 10 years
ago, those in Europe will seek alternatives.

   Telecommunications is now the central nervous system of a
service-based global economy based increasingly on the exchange of
electronic information. Electronic information exchange is the commodity that
will fuel economic growth into the 21st century.

INCREASING CHOICE

   Today, the spread of competition in Europe's most liberalized
markets has resulted in increasing choice in equipment and service offerings.
This new-found freedom is leading users to articulate their needs and
shape the development of a free marketplace.

   The lumbering telecoms administrations, slow to wake to the realities of
the marketplace, are responding in piecemeal fashion. Offerings such as
one-stop shopping are emerging.

   But these are not enough.

   The regulatory impediments against pan-European networking and tariffs
that are too high are forcing users to implement alternative solutions.

   One such alternative is very small aperture terminal (VSAT)
satellite operations which are a proven means of bypassing the fixed-link
network. Others may be emerging mobile radio services or even competitive
fixed networks.

ASTONISHING CHANGES

   Since the 1989 International User Survey, astonishing changes have been
witnessed. The Iron Curtain has collapsed: Germany has united; new
European institutions are emerging and old ones are forced to change;
monopolies, cartels and trade barriers are crumbling; competition and foreign
investment are being welcomed, not resisted; privatization of public holdings
is more commonplace; new international agreements, regulatory liberalization
and competition are exerting a forceful downward pressure on tariffs.

   In short, there is no turning back.

   These changes have helped users assume control of their own destiny. No
longer will they accept having to adapt to the dictates of monopoly service
providers. Now it is the suppliers who must learn to adapt. They must offer
real choice in their product and service offerings at internationally
competitive prices.

   The 1990 Survey confirms that telecoms has finally entered the boardroom.
An overwhelming number of telecoms managers now report to board members or
information technology directors.

   Users don't believe they are getting value for their money. With
the exception of facsimile, the vast majority of respondents rated telecoms
administration services as mediocre, on a scale of 1 to 5.

   For international communications, users' catalog of complaints
range from the lack of international standards to the fact that their needs
were being misunderstood.

IMPLICATIONS UNKNOWN

   However, while users recognize the potentially devastating effects of
network failure, in almost all cases the survey shows the cost of network
failure has not been calculated by users. Consequently, the full implications
are not known.

   At the grassroots level, and despite the European Commission's
terminal equipment directive, users in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,
Spain and Germany remain concerned that regulatory restrictions on modem usage
are inhibiting their business.

   Increasingly, regulation covering mobile radio and satellite terminal
equipment is becoming a key concern.

   In terms of regulatory controls on service offerings, the biggest area of
concern among users is in the interconnection of private networks to the
public switched telephone network, an issue that is pointedly not addressed by
the Commission's framework for Open Network Provision across
Europe.

   This is closely followed by a desire to see a relaxation in the rules
governing the resale of spare capacity and satellite usage. Rules governing
cable television, mobile radio and electronic mail form a second tier of
concern.

   From the perspective of the service provider, the three areas that stand
out as being most affected by competition are mobile radio, leased circuits,
and packet switched data communications.

   In the burgeoning field of mobile communications, while almost 25 percent
of users are represented by high-level management, the survey found that
up to 30 percent of users of mobile communications are now employed in direct
sales. Cost remains the crucial issue in the uptake of mobile technology.

   Significantly, the survey revealed a decidedly low demand for international
roaming capability as embodied in the forthcoming pan-European digital
cellular radio network.

 TARIFFS MUST FALL

   Overall, though deregulation bodes well for a reduction in telecoms costs
it may be bad news for telecoms managers.

   The survey indicates an average salary level throughout Western Europe of
$40,000 a year. Switzerland again tops the salary poll, followed
closely by Spain and France-evidence perhaps that telecoms managers in
countries with a traditionally strong monopoly regime stand to gain the
most.

   In future, mobility and the ability to acquire new skills will be crucial
in the post-1992 deregulated market.
    The unmistakable message of the 1990 international user survey is that
telecoms tariffs must fall, and they must fall soon.

   More than 70 percent of respondents believe the move toward cost-based
pricing would have a major impact on their businesses. For voice, the
overwhelming demand is for cheaper international and long-distance calls.
For data, this criteria is matched only by the demand for lower usage
charges.

   For leased circuits, cheaper international and long distance charges is
matched only by demand for lower fixed costs. And for satellites, the general
desire is for cheaper tariffs and lower fixed costs.

   With a mounting downward pressure on international and long-distance
tariffs, what will determine the balance of power between the public telecoms
operators and users?

   And will that balance favor the use of public or private network
solutions?

   Clearly, the public/private network tradeoff for users will depend on that
user's volume of traffic and the concentration of traffic by route.
Increasingly, however, choice will be determined by the price of leased
circuits, in particular, relative to the public network and also by the value
assigned by the user to proprietary control, security, reliability,
availability, and response time.

   With tariffs falling, and leased circuits an increasingly attractive
option, the battlefield for the coming few years is therefore likely to be
over a relaxation of regulatory controls both on VSAT networks and for
private-to-public network interconnection.

How This Users Survey Was Conducted

    To compile the information for this study, CommunicationsWeek
International and PA Consulting Group sent out more than 5,700 questionnaires.
We received 317 responses, a healthy response rate of about 5 percent, upon
which we based our stories.

   Participants were asked to react to a series of questions by assigning
a numerical value from one to five, with one representing `not important'
and five representing `very important.'

   Marks in the range of two to four were most common, while extremes were
rare. In some cases, however, extreme marks came in waves as the
respondent unleashed a long line of `ones' for poor service or `fives' for
the desirability of cheaper tariffs and competition.

   The result, generally, is that users' desires appeared in shades of
grey.

   What we have tried to do is give meaning to those shades.

HOW IT BREAKS DOWN

   Generally, respondents used the questionnaire to comment on the things they
felt most strongly about-in some cases leaving other questions
unanswered. There is a striking consistency from country to country in the
completion rate for each major section in the questionnaire.

   Completion patterns fell into three broad categories:

   o People who tried to answer everything, failing only to evaluate those
services unavailable to them;

   o People who only answered the section which interested them
most-international telecommunications, security, encouragement of mobile
services and public service tariffing;

   o People who answered the minimum number of questions.

   The typical completion rates for the various survey sections were as
follows:

   o Management structure-60 percent;

   o Telecoms administration service/quality-10-45 percent;

   o International telecommunications-80 percent;

   o Security-90 percent;

   o Mobile services-55 percent;

   o Impact of national regulation-50 percent;

   o Telecoms administration concerns (telecoms administrations
only)-10 percent;

   o Impact of tariffs-55 percent;

   o Other factors-70 percent.

   THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SURVEY

   Working closely with the CommunicationsWeek International staff on this
project was PA Consulting Group, a leading international management and
technology consultancy based in London and with offices in 20 countries.

    As was the case with last year's survey, London-based John
Buckley, director, telecommunications, lead the PA team.

   The writers and researchers were David Gillick, manager, policy and
regulations, computers and telecommunications; Garry Garrard, manager, mobile
communications; Peter Jenner, business manager, security consultancy centre;
Michele Williamson, consultant, human resources; Michel Bensimhon, manager,
computers and telecommunications (France); Karl Schreiner, manager,
computers and telecommunications (Germany).

International Telecoms Needs -- Are Europe's
Users Ready To Go Global?

    By John Buckley

         Telecoms administrations and suppliers have a long way to go before
meeting European users' needs.

   Despite their efforts to improve their services, and despite the attempts
by international bodies to re-shape the regulatory and competitive
environment in Europe, the results of this year's survey by PA
Consulting Group, of London, and CommunicationsWeek International, like last
year's, show that users aren't feeling enough of an
impact.

   With high international tariffs also becoming a greater concern this year,
European users may find themselves losing out to competitors from other parts
of the world, particularly North America, where telecoms regulations are
flexible and the market is more competitive.

   PICKING UP THE PACE

      In the last 12 months, the member states of the European Community have
picked up the pace of establishing a truly pan-European market for
general goods and services.

   Not only are they completing preparations for the planned 1992 launch of
their internal market; they are also taking wider steps toward opening
cross-border trade with Eastern Europe.

   These moves, plus other developments in world trade, are extending the
horizons of European trading companies; many that had been content doing
strictly domestic business are now thinking of marketing on a global
basis.

   Not surprisingly, therefore, Europe's business community is finding
international telecommunications more and more important. After all, a
company's ability to communicate efficiently with customers, distributors
or subsidiaries in other countries can be crucial to its market
penetration, particularly in countries where it competes with local-based
companies enjoying shorter lines of communication.

   But are the international telecoms needs of these growing companies being
met?

   If not, what problems are they experiencing?

LACK OF STANDARDS CITED

   The 1990 survey shows that, despite the considerable efforts of
international bodies to develop common standards, European users consider the
lack of unifying standards to be the single largest obstacle to international
communications.  This was also the finding in last year's survey,
suggesting that whatever the progress on international standards, the impact
is not strong enough or fast enough for users.

   Close behind the complaints about standards comes criticism of the service
limitations of the telecoms administrations, with users in Spain and Poland
being the most critical, but with all European countries expressing
concern.

   Closely allied with this concern are complaints against regulatory
restrictions; feelings of users about telecoms administrations service
limitations and regulatory restrictions seem to be running stronger this year
than in last year's survey. This level of concern is due largely to
the fact that telecoms providers and regulators often do not keep pace with
accelerating advances in technology, thus competition from potential new
market entrants is often stifled.

    But it is also clear that users are becoming much better informed about
telecoms developments; they are increasingly aware of what is technologically
feasible and what is available in certain other countries, for instance in the
United States, but which may be denied to them through regulatory constraints
in their own country.

   An example is satellite communications, where European users have come up
against the inflexibility of certain administrations and other service
providers; whereas in North America similar problems can be solved by the
flexibility of two-way satellite services allowed under the very small
aperture terminal (VSAT) arrangements.

   Because of these types of difficulties, plus the globalization of their own
businesses, users feel a strong need for suppliers to offer serviceson a
global basis.

   Eastern European countries, of course, have a major task ahead of them
before they can offer good quality communications, either within their
countries or internationally, and already there is a great deal of activity on
this score in many of the countries concerned.

   The responses to the survey show that when European users were asked about
the quality of international communications, those in Eastern Europe tended to
be the most critical (though those in Yugoslavia were among the most
satisfied).

    Interestingly, the countries most dissatisfied with their international
telecoms also included Luxembourg, France, Finland and Switzerland.

   But whether in Eastern or Western Europe, the level of tariffs charged for
international telecoms is recognized as a major issue.

   When asked in the survey which kind of tariff reductions would affect the
way they used public telecoms services, users cited high international call
charges for both data and voice.

   With the changing face of Europe and the globalization of markets, the
European users' need for effective international telecommunications
is becoming increasingly crucial.

   And telecoms authorities have shown that they can bring change about
quickly when they really want to-for instance, in West and East Germany,
where administrations are working to integrate their services.

   As pressure mounts in Europe for improving the level of international
telecommunications, users clearly wish to see administrations, government
bodies and others bring these changes about quickly.

Price The Missing Element In Europe's Mobile
Market

    By Garry Garrard

         Although mobile communications service providers plan to offer an
increasingly wide range of new services and facilities in Europe in the next
two years, users say they would prefer lower prices.

   In fact, users in nearly every country surveyed by PA Consulting Group, of
London, and CommunicationsWeek International rate the prospect of lower
cellular costs more favorably than the industry's plans to introduce
GSM, PCN, Telepoint and DECT technologies.

   Lower equipment costs also outpolled such concerns as extended national
coverage, service quality, and provision of international roaming, data
services and smaller phone size.

   Cost was particularly an issue in the Benelux countries, Germany, Italy and
Spain, where competition and choice are limited and where prices are far
higher than the European average. But price was also a concern in Scandinavia,
where the mobile phone market has been liberalized for years.

   Only in the United Kingdom was equipment price not considered important,
but mobile phone equipment is often given away there, or sold at highly
discounted prices. U.K. users almost unanimously called for lower call
charges-even more so than German users, who pay more. This reflects high
penetration in the United Kingdom and the growing proportion of telecoms
budgets spent on mobile communications as usage seeps down to lower levels of
the company hierarchy.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

   There are more than three million cellular phone users in Europe, where the
market has grown nearly 60 percent in the past year, indicating buoyancy. But
clearly there is still room for growth in Europe's cellular market.
Will demand be spurred by the new services and improved facilities planned for
next year?

   These developments include GSM, a digital cellular service that will offer
integrated services digital network compatibility and international roaming;
personal communications networks, which will start in the United Kingdom in
1992, offering users new services, including some taking advantage of
smart-card technology; Telepoint, which is being adopted in many
countries using CT2 technology, and DECT, a new European standard for cordless
telephones which is currently in development.

   If the new technologies are to be successful, then use of mobile
communications must become more common. More than a third of the organizations
surveyed provide mobile phones only to senior management.

   Outside the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, most companies still regard a
cellular phone as a privilege or a status symbol, instead of a tool to
increase business efficiency or improve customer service. This attitude was
prevalent in the United Kingdom for some time after cellular was introduced,
but has now changed considerably.

EXTENDED COVERAGE

   A similar effect can be expected in other countries where penetration is
low, and there is limited awareness of the real benefits of mobile phones.

   Cellular networks usually start in major cities, with less populated areas
brought along gradually. The survey reflects the desire for national networks
to offer extended coverage, with users clearly refusing to accept
limitations.

   According to the survey, extending coverage was the top priority in France
and Italy, and an important issue in Spain. Even in Norway and Finland, where
population coverage is high, improvements would be welcomed, presumably in the
large, sparsely populated regions to the north.

   The speed of rollout of GSM coverage is specified in a memorandum of
understanding signed by all the European cellular operators. However, the
minimum requirements are modest compared even to that of current analog
services in France, Italy and Spain. It seems unlikely the GSM will be able to
compete seriously in the market unless the operators exceed their rollout
commitments considerably.

SERVICE QUALITY

   Service quality is another factor affecting basic mobile telephony that is
important to users, who find it frustrating when calls drop out or channels
aren't available when needed. Because U.K. cellular networks have
been heavily criticized for failing to provide adequate service, it was no
surprise to find that this is still an issue for U.K. users, even though
Cellnet, at least, has been publicizing that it is improving its
infrastructure.

   The strongest implied criticisms of service quality, however, come from
Sweden, where congestion in the Stockholm area can cause problems, as well as
Finland and Spain.

   The factors mentioned so far affect all basic telephony, but new features
or service upgrades were also investigated: International roaming, data
services and availability of smaller phones produced some unexpected
results.

   Conventional wisdom says demand for international roaming is small and
concentrated in the Benelux region. While the survey indeed shows a modest
requirement across Europe, only an average demand exists in Belgium and the
Netherlands. The strongest response came from Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Hungary!

   In Western Europe, Germany showed the highest level of interest, followed
by Portugal and Switzerland. Still, users rated roaming less significant than
price reductions.

   There is moderate interest in mobile data services everywhere, but
these receive low priority from most experienced users. Finland was the
only country with reasonable cellular penetration to highlight data as a
priority need. Other countries enthusiastic about data either had low
penetration (Spain, Italy and Portugal) or no service at all (Greece.)

   As cellular markets mature, and mobile telephones become widely accepted,
users recognize that most requirements are for simple telephony.

   The results of the survey have some clear messages for the success of GSM.
The pan-European digital cellular system has been developed with
comprehensive features.

COST TO USERS IMPORTANT

    Compatibility with ISDN, and the availability of international roaming,
are often quoted as the most significant features of the new system but
neither is likely to increase market growth to any great degree. Costs to
users will be far more important.

   It has been estimated that when the GSM system starts, infrastructure costs
will be 20 to 30 percent lower than for analog systems, and competition in
equipment supply can be expected to drive prices down even more as the system
matures.

    Operators will not be locked to a single manufacturer after they select
their initial supplier. If operators follow European Commission policy, and
relate tariffs directly to costs, users should gradually see the decrease in
network charges that they want, and the market will grow even faster.

   The complexity of GSM will make early phones large and expensive, compared
to analog versions. However, the survey showed that phone size was of little
concern, and in many countries GSM should have little problem competing with
analog mobiles-particularly in Germany, the largest potential market in
Europe.

   Reciprocal type approval, where a product approved for use in one country
will be accepted in other countries, allowing users to shop around, and volume
production will lead to rapid price reductions, and by 1993 or 1994, GSM
mobiles and hand-portables should be available throughout Europe at
reasonable prices.

   GSM has been seen as a triumph of technological cooperation. It is
undoubtedly true that great progress has been made, but it seems likely that
its real achievement will be political, by transferring the benefits of
competition and volume production to countries where it has been stoutly
resisted.

What Users Were Saying One Year Ago

    Users have found their voices.

   Increased competition throughout Europe, and the prospect of even further
liberalization, has empowered them-and with new and varied choices in
equipment and service offerings has come the leverage to make demands.

   This empowerment is clearly reflected in this year's
CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group survey.

   This year, users loudly articulated their needs-and their expectations
that these needs will be met.

   This is a change from last year, when survey respondents took a more
diffident approach, expressing their wishes from the position of the harried
professional left to contend with batches of problems foisted upon them by
manufacturers, telecoms administrators and even their own companies
(CommunicationsWeek International, 16 October, 1989).

   What follows is a summary of some of those wishes.

   o On spending:

   Users in all sectors surveyed foresaw greater outlays on communications,
with the service, transport and government sectors reporting an increase in
spending of more than 25 percent last year. In contrast, respondents from
finance companies expected to see only a 5 percent annual increase over
1988.

   Yet, even as overall spending was expected to rise, the proportion to be
spent on international communications was to grow, according to the survey.
Respondents predicted an average increase of 10 percent in international
communications spending between 1988 and 1989, with international
communications accounting for 35 percent of all spending in 1989.

   o On the telecommunications administrations:

   Users were generally content with the quality of service their telecoms
adminstrations provided. Switzerland, Finland and France were judged to have
the highest quality networks, while Italy was said to have the worst.

   Users did say they wanted standard international data network services with
quality network management and common tariffs-things that telecoms
administrations did not provide.

   o On facilities management:

   More than half of the telecoms professionals surveyed said they were likely
to adopt facilities management approaches for data communications by 1994.
There was also significant interest in outsourcing as a management tool for
voice networks.

   o On managed data network services:

   Last year's survey predicted that the importance of managed data
network service would grow 24 percent across Europe, with growth fastest in
the transport and manufacturing sectors in Norway, Sweden, Italy and the
United Kingdom.

   o On packet switching:

   The survey predicted that international public packet switching services
would become as important as international voice networks.

   o On public voice services:

   Public voice services were also expected to grow significantly in
importance while private voice networks remained at their 1989 levels of
importance.

   o On the integrated services digital network:

   Response to ISDN varied depending on where the question was asked. In the
United Kingdom, for instance, ISDN had lukewarm appeal, with only 46 percent
of the survey respondents saying they believe ISDN is critical to the
development of telecoms services and 46 percent saying it would be moderately
useful. In France, Belgium and West Germany, however, 70 percent of those
questioned saw ISDN as critical.

   o On electronic communications services:

   Respondents to last year's survey predicted that electronic
communications services would play an important role in their futures, with
public electronic mail, electronic data interchange and videoconferencing
rated as the fasted growing new technologies for international communications
users.

   o On open systems:

   Almost half of the users questioned last year predicted that Open Systems
Interconnection would oust IBM's proprietary SNA in the 1990s as the
most popular networking technology. Only 9 percent of the companies surveyed
felt that SNA would gain a dominant position.

   o On facsimile and telex technologies:

   Last year's survey showed that facsimile was as important to
companies as voice services, but demand was not expected to grow
significantly. As for telex, users predicted that it would soon become an
anachronism.

   o On barriers to international development:

   Lack of standards was deemed to be the single greatest barrier to
international development last year; this was closely followed by staff and
skill shortages, limitations of telecoms administration services, vendors not
understanding the needs of users, product limitations, regulatory
restrictions, inadequate network management and insufficient support for
business managers.

   o On human resources:

   Average salaries for telecoms staff in western Europe hovered around
$46,000; most managers in eastern European countries earned less than
$15,000 a year.

   Information systems managers were paid the least, averaging $39,000,
with network/operations managers earning only slightly more.

   The highest salary levels were found in the finance sector, with
respondents reporting an average of $53,000. Those in energy averaged
$46,000; transport, $45,000.

   Government salaries were said to be on a par with government, with averages
of $44,000.

   The biggest problem facing telecoms managers in private industry last year
was staff shortages. One-third of the respondents employed by governments
called staff shortages a major problem, while as many as 70 percent of the
respondents in other areas said there was a serious lack of workers.

   o Other points related by the human resources section of the 1989
survey include:

   Only one of every four managers reported to an information technology
director; telecoms managers were more likely to report to an operations
manager, administration manager or the finance department.

      Most telecoms professionals served more than 200 people, and about
$10,000 was spent each year on each person who uses telecoms
facilities.

Increasing User Anxiety Surrounds Data Security

    By By Peter Jenner

         With more and more businesses in Europe depending on third parties
to exchange information for them, data security is proving to be a significant
concern.

   This growing anxiety is reflected in results of the survey conducted by PA
Consulting Group, of London, and CommunicationsWeek International. Ninety
percent of the respondents answered the questions on security, easily the
highest response level for any of the subject areas the questionnaire covered.
(The next highest category was international telecommunications, with an
80 percent rate of response.)

    Probably the most significant outcome of the whole survey was the response
to the questions concerning availability. More than 80 percent of the
respondents admitted that they had no idea how much it would cost their
companies if their communications networks were to fail. Yet more than half of
those who had estimated the potential losses thought it would cost $1
million or more if the network collapsed.

   Such a result suggests that most managers still subscribe to the attitude
that ``it won't happen to me.''

   Confidentiality of information has always been the most prominent security
issue in the minds of managers and the survey confirms that this remains
so: Sixty-eight percent of the respondents said confidentiality was
their biggest headache.

CONFIDENTIALITY CRITICAL

   There are many cases where confidentiality is critical but an objective
analysis usually shows that they are in the minority. In most cases, an
objective assessment of risks to the business would clearly show that failure
to ensure the integrity of information, such as money transfers, or lack of
availability of data-for example, in process control-would cause
much more damage or direct losses than if someone were to feed at the
information.

   In other words, businesses are more worried about the hacker than they are
about maintaining and transmitting incorrect data.

    An example of the need for integrity in the finance sector was an
attempted 20 million fraud targeted at Mitsubishi International Finance
Corporation. The fraudsters tapped into EUCLID, the Eurobond information and
clearing service, using a home computer and modem and tried to divert funds to
a Swiss bank account. The attempt failed only because the staff at the bank
receiving the proceeds queried the transaction. A better-planned attempt
could have been more successful.

   One way of preventing this attempt would have been to check that the money
transfer request was valid, thus ensuring the integrity of the data.

   Concern over privacy has been growing over the past few years. Much of this
concern is directed towards the storage and processing of personal data in
computer systems.

GROWING CONCERN

   Each European country has a data protection law which, in spite of its
name, is intended to protect personal privacy and shield the public from what
is seen as an insidious threat, as vast banks of computer-held data
spread across the world. Such data might easily be incorrect or open to
abuse.

   The survey showed that companies in many sectors hear the message and are
giving the issue the attention it deserves.

   In the government, health and education sectors the most prominent concern
by far was confidentiality of personal and employment-record information.
But in some sectors-mostly retail and distribution-concern over
personal privacy was far lower, pointing to a lack of concern about
customers' information.

    Business managers do not seem to realize that data protection laws give
equal protection to the rights of the corporate individual as to the private
individual. Companies should recognize this deficiency and take care over who
holds information about them and their businesses.

   Conversely, despite the importance of confidentiality in the public
sectors, there was no recognition of the need to care about
customers' data, and in many cases no recognition of the existence
of customers.

NATURAL DISASTERS

   There are many stories of accidents and disasters that cripple
communications facilities and can cost millions. One of the more extreme was
the 17 October 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, which many businesses
survived without physical damage, but which made for very heavy financial
losses because their computers could not communicate with the outside world
long afterward.

    Less dramatically, many businesses realized how risky it is to depend on a
single supplier when British Telecom engineers went on strike in 1988.

   Another common cause of problems is bad capacity planning. An example of
this was the Companies Registration Office in the United Kingdom, which had 35
computing system breakdowns in seven months. Of these, two were due to loss of
power, two to operating system problems and 31 to network overload.

A Look At The Human Side Of Telecommunications

    By Michele Williamson

         Liberalization is not just about suppliers competing to provide the
best value equipment and services, it is also about jobs.

   As the market is freed across the continent, people, too, will compete for
better paying work with more status and improved working conditions.

   And as telecoms deregulation takes hold, and the European Community moves
toward economic unity, the job market will change. The post-1992 single
market will be as much about the freedom of movement of people as it will be
about goods and services.

    But Europe still consists of a patchwork of telecoms structures and
policies, from the centralized East to free-market West.

   And as such, the 1990 CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group
survey results confirm that there are vast differences in the perceived value,
importance and earnings of telecoms professionals from one country to the
next.

   Most telecoms departments are fairly small: Sixty-four percent
of survey respondents report fewer than 10 members and 81 percent are in
departments of fewer than 26. The vast majority-87 percent-report
directly to either an information technology director (45 percent)
or other board member (42 percent).

   Most of the 6 percent who belong to departments with 100 or more people,
work in the United Kingdom. That country, however, has more large companies
than most other Community states and this probably accounts for the
difference.

   Many senior telecoms managers and directors reached their position through
experience and not through formal education, starting their working careers as
juniors in telecoms or with the armed forces as radio operators, or with the
national telecoms administration.

   But this is changing. Formal training-in business as well as
technology-is becoming more important among the newer generation of
would-be managers. Developing more slowly, the world over, is higher
education in communications. Compared with the United States, which has
pioneered higher education in business and telecommunications, Europe can only
offer a handful of MBA-type courses.
    The survey found that the highest paid professionals are not found in the
most liberal regime, the United Kingdom, where the average telecoms
professional salary is under $40,000 a year, but in monopoly markets
such as France and, in particular, Switzerland, where the average salary is
more than $60,000. Switzerland, whose telecoms professionals are paid
three times as much as their Polish colleagues, also dominated last
year's salary league table.

COMPETITION PLAYS ROLE

   This, too, could well change as competition takes over. Although
competition is not the only factor that determines salary levels-pay
scales are consistently higher for all industry sectors in certain
countries-it could play a significant part in an open, mobile employment
market.

    Apart from differences in the telecoms markets themselves, the cost of
living varies enormously from one country to another, and there are different
national pay customs and cultural factors. In some countries, employees are
paid extra if they work outside normal business hours. Salaries vary not just
between countries but according to business sector.

   The tremendous salary range from one industry sector to another in the
United Kingdom, for instance, is clearly seen in the results of PA's
1990 Survey of Employment Trends in Telecoms. A network technician could earn
12,200 in the manufacturing sector, up to 17,300 in the financial industry; a
telecoms manager would make 25,600 in manufacturing and 31,000 in
finance.

   These variations reflect such factors as the employer's level of
investment in technology and the relative importance of telecoms in a
particular business.

THE CHALLENGE AHEAD

   Countries on the threshold of deregulation and new technology can
potentially reap the benefits of skills and solutions developed by the
pioneering countries. But countries that deregulate early face the prospect of
losing their valuable skills to these``developing'' countries.

   This is both a threat and an opportunity, and it will grow as 1992
approaches and as Eastern Europe opens up. For example, skilled U.K.
telecoms specialists, earning only around $40,000-an average sum by
European standards-may be well-placed for comparatively well-paid jobs in
newly liberalized regimes, provided they have the necessary language
skills and can adapt to a new country.

   On the other hand, telecoms professionals whose security may be threatened
by the coming deregulation must be prepared to welcome change and to work with
colleagues from other national backgrounds.

   Just how significant this movement of the skills base will be remains
to be seen. Some people now predict that as equipment becomes more
complex, but user friendly, user organizations will need smaller numbers
of better-qualified technical people and fewer low-level operators.

   The role of the European telecoms professional is on the verge of changing
along with the move to a new Europe. Since the nature of that change is
uncertain, posing a mix of both opportunity and threat, the chances that
personal and economic circumstances will be affected are enormous. The
question is, how much will inertia hinder the revolution?
