<P>An economical process for producing hydrogen (H<SUB>2</sub>), based on 
biological or chemical systems, would ideally be water- 
(H<sub>2</sub>O)-derived, solar-driven, highly efficient, durable, 
insensitive to H<SUB>2</sub> partial pressure, and inexpensive to build 
and operate.  Among the biological options, systems of intact cells of 
photosynthetic bacteria are the most advanced.  Unlike cyanobacteria or 
algae, photosynthetic bacteria do not oxidize H<sub>2</sub>O.  They do, 
however, evolve H<SUB>2</sub> from biomass (previously generated from 
sunlight, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub>).  These bacteria use 
several different enzymatic mechanisms with near-term commercial 
potential for biological H<SUB>2</sub> production from biomass.
<P>
We are working on producing a pure H<SUB>2</sub> stream  from thermally 
gasified biomass 
(synthesis gas) using a bacterial catalyst for gas conditioning.  A 
unique type of 
H<SUB>2</sub>-producing activity was found in a strain of photosynthetic 
bacteria that 
functioned only in darkness to shift CO (and H<SUB>2</sub>O) into 
H<SUB>2</sub>O 
(and CO<SUB>2</sub>).  We have isolated more than 400 strains of 
photosynthetic 
bacteria from local sites that perform this shift in the dark but also 
quantitatively assimilate CO into new cell mass in the light, which makes 
them easier to grow.  We have tested many of our strains for CO shift 
activity and growth with crude (water-
scrubbed only) synthesis gas (primarily CO and H<SUB>2</sub>) generated 
from thermally gasified wood chips.  In the light, the novel 
photosynthetic bacteria assimilate the CO and H<SUB>2</sub> components 
and a portion of the trace gases.  In the dark, all of the isolates 
respond similarly by shifting the CO into additional H<SUB>2</sub>, 
thereby leaving a product gas highly enriched in H<SUB>2</sub>.  No 
inhibitory effects of synthesis gas on long-term photosynthetic growth 
are noted.  At ambient temperature and pressure conditions, starting from 
20% CO in the gas phase, less than 18 ppm of CO (0.0018%) remain at 
equilibrium.
<P>
To determine the feasibility of using the biological catalysts for 
large-scale conditioning 
of synthesis gas, we need further information on the maximum activities 
and durabilities of the enzymes involved.  From an engineering 
standpoint, the rate-limiting step is in the mass transfer of the gaseous 
substrate into the aqueous phase of the bacteria.  This is being 
addressed by using reversibly immobilized bacteria in the absence of a 
bulk water phase.
<P>
A number of photosynthetic bacterial isolates were selected for 
O<sub>2</sub>-tolerant 
hydrogenase enzymes.  Genetic transfer, expression, and linkage of an 
O<sub>2</sub>-tolerant hydrogenase enzyme in a cyanobacterial or algal 
host will create a photobiological system that can conditionally evolve 
H<SUB>2</sub> from H<SUB>2</sub>O for extended periods of time.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>
<P>


The water-gas shift activity of <I>Rhodobacter sp. </I>CBS is

more fully expressed when the cells are exposed to 10% CO at elevated

pressures.  About a fivefold increase in activity from the entire

bacterial population was observed in going from one atmosphere

pressure to 10 atmospheres.  The culture readily utilizes 100%

CO at 2 atmospheres pressure but is inhibited by 7 atmospheres

of 100% CO.  Spontaneous mutants able to tolerate the latter conditions

are being examined.  In principle, their increased CO tolerance

should be due to further over-expression of the shift enzymes.

 The CBS-2 mutant strain was isolated by exposing a CBS culture

to 5% O<sub>2</sub> while growing on CO.  The mutant was selected 
probably

because it has 364% of the shift activity of its parent and could

better survive O<sub>2</sub>-inactivation of the sensitive proteins.

<P>

Further rounds of both mutant selection techniques are being performed

to significantly enhance shift activity.  Both are positive selection

techniques that permit a bacterium's selection in the 1 in 
10<sup>10</sup>

range.  Since these are gain-of-function mutants, they are potentially

useful in application schemes and will out-compete revertants

or invading wild-type bacteria in bioreactors.  This is absolutely

necessary since none of the application schemes utilizes sterile

conditions.  The mutant strains will be incorporated into bioreactor

designs that have shown enhanced mass transfer activity (principally

the hollow-fiber, trickle-filter, and bubble-train designs). 

The trickle-filter and bubble-train bioreactors can be pressurized

to about 10 atmospheres.  The combination of improved microbes

and enhanced mass transfer should significantly elevate H<sub>2</sub> 
production

rates.
