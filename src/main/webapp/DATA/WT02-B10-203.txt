<h3 align=center>Case Example #2</h3>
<p align=center>(names and details altered to prevent identification)</p>
<p>When Peggy was first evaluated for admission to an inpatient eating disorder program, she was a 
20-year-old woman who had difficulty supporting her 5'3&quot; body with a weight of only 67 pounds. 
She had begun to lose weight 4 years earlier, initially dieting to lose an unwanted 6 pounds. 
Encouraged by compliments on her new body, she proceeded to lose 8 more pounds. Over the 
next 2 years she continued to lose weight, increased her physical activity until her weight reached a 
low of 64 pounds, and stopped menstruating. She was admitted to a medical unit, treated for 
peptic ulcer disease, and discharged, only to he admitted 3 months thereafter to the psychiatric unit 
of a general hospital. During that 8-week hospitalization, she went from 84 pounds to 100 pounds. 
She did well until she went off to college, where, with increased academic and social demands, she 
again began to diet until she weighed only 67 pounds. Her eating habits were ritualized: she cut 
food into very small pieces, moved them around on the plate, and ate very slowly. She resisted 
eating foods with high fat and carbohydrate content. She was troubled by the changes in her body, 
and became increasingly anxious as her figure developed. She was forced to drop out of school 
and to accept another hospitalization . </p>
<p>Peggy was motivated to comply with treatment, but her fears of gaining weight and becoming obese 
affected her progress. She was expected to gain a minimum of 2 pounds every week, and she was 
restricted to bed rest if she failed to gain sufficient weight. In psychotherapy Peggy was gradually 
guided to discuss her feelings and to actually look at herself in the mirror. She was initially instructed 
to look at one part of her body for a minimum of 10 seconds, and the time was progressively 
increased until she could look at her whole body without any anxiety. Her menses returned at a 
weight of 93 pounds. After 7 months of individual and family treatment, she was discharged at a 
weight of 100 pounds. Peggy returned to college, worked part time, and lived with her parents. </p>

<h3 align=center>Discussion </h3>
<p>As is usually the case with Anorexia Nervosa, the characteristic signs and symptoms leave little 
doubt concerning the correct diagnosis. Peggy has all of the salient features, including refusal to 
maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height; intense fear of 
gaining weight or of becoming fat, even though underweight; disturbance in the way in which her 
body weight or shape is experienced (anxiety when viewing her body); and in postmenarchal 
females, amenorrhea. Because her method of losing weight has never involved purging 
(self-induced vomiting or use of laxatives or diuretics) or binge eating (consumption of large 
amounts of food with a sense of loss of control), the subtype is specified as Restricting Type. </p>
<p>Peggy exhibited compulsive ritualistic behavior with regard to food (e.g., cutting her food into very 
small pieces and moving it around on her plate before eating it), a feature commonly see in patients 
with Anorexia Nervosa. Although her compulsive eating behavior might suggest the possible 
additional diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, a separate diagnosis is not given as the 
compulsive behavior is accounted for by the diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa. </p>
<p>During the course of the Anorexia Nervosa, Peggy experienced depression and panic attacks. 
There is insufficient information about these symptoms to make a definitive diagnosis of a Mood or 
an Anxiety Disorder. However, the occurrence of these comorbid disorders is common in patients 
with Anorexia Nervosa. </p>
<p>Anorexia Nervosa is a serious and often life-threatening disorder. This case illustrates that with 
expert treatment, a good outcome is possible. </p>

<h3 align=center>Follow up </h3>
<p>Over the next 10 years, Peggy graduated from college with a degree in nutrition and was selected 
to do an internship with a major corporation. She has excelled in her work, receiving several 
promotions. She married, but the relationship deteriorated as her husband became physically 
abusive. She moved out, obtained a court order of protection, and eventually a divorce. Her most 
recent correspondence told of her return to graduate school (all expenses paid and full salary), a 
new romance, and success in a marathon (third place in a 26-mile race). She has maintained her 
weight at around 116 pounds and menstruates normally. She did seek counseling to sort out issues 
related to her broken marriage and her estrangement from her sister, which has since been 
resolved. She describes her life now as full and satisfying. </p>
