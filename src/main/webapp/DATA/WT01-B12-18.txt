<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VALUABLE LIPIDS (PUFA'S) </H2>

 <P>  In recent years, interest has matured regarding lipid compounds, which have evolved as valuable nutritional substances. One group of these are the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's). These fatty acids are named by identifying the number of carbon atoms in their molecule and indicating the number of double or unsaturated bonds. For instance, a PUFA with eighteen carbons and three double bonds would be called 18:3 by scientists.   Some well known sources of PUFA's are the unsaturated cooking oils such as sunflower and canola oils. Soybean oil is well known for its content of PUFA's. Fish oils, which have been researched for their ability to reduce cholesterol and improve health of the heart and circulatory system, also contain PUFA's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OMEGA 6 & OMEGA 3</H2>
 <P>  Two basic categories of PUFA's that have received a lot of attention relative to human nutrition are the Omega 6 and Omega 3's. Omega 6 PUFA's are contained in all vegetable oils. Omega 6's are almost totally made up of linoleic acid (18:2) and it's derivatives. Some of the Omega 6's are considered more valuable, such as GLA (gamma linolenic, 18:3) found in evening primrose and borage oils. Omega 3's are found to a limited degree in some plants but are contained in all fish and shellfish.  For instance, canola and flax oils contain alpha linolenic acid (18:3).  The Omega 3 PUFA's contained in fish are from five to ten times more powerful in their biological activity than those found in plants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TERMINOLOGY</H2>
 <P>  There are three known valuable Omega 3 PUFA's in fish. They are  EPA,  DHA  and  the  amazing  LYPRINOL.    EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), the most well known, is usually accompanied by DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Eicosa means 20, docosa means 22, pent means 5 and hex means 6. So then, eicosapentaenoic acid could be described as 20:5, and docosahexaenoic as 22:6. All this terminology is simply to bring us to a more detailed understanding for discussion purposes about LYPRINOL. We may call them "Super" Omega 3's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LYPRINOL</H2>
<P>   The most current research is now demonstrating a whole new group of related, but different PUFA's. Over twenty years of research has produced a better understanding of ETA (eicosaetraennoic acid). ETA is a 20:4, a twenty carbon molecule with four double bonds.  These newly found and isolated compounds have the greatest biological activity of all and show amazing promise for those who need to supplement with them.</P>
<P>  The most valuable ETA's have been extracted from the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel, Perna canaliculus. This unique mussel has been used as food for many years in that part of the world and seems to have added greatly to the health of those including it in their diet. One noticeable trait is that they seem to have a significant decrease in stiffness and joint swelling and discomfort as they age. This lead researchers to try to understand why this was so. Scientists have been conducting research on the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel now for over thirty years and have been learning some very important facts.</P>
<P>   It  is  acknowledged  by  many  scientists  and  government committees around the world that the western diet provides more Omega 6 PUFA's relative to Omega 3's. This leads to our cellular 
membranes becoming rich in the Omega 6's such as arachidonic acid, which is a precursor to certain molecules that can cause inflammatory processes associated with arthritis, psoriasis and asthma to name a few. Many studies have reported that certain lipids from fish and other marine sources can have a beneficial effect on our overall health when they are a part of the diet on a routine basis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PERNA CANALICULUS</H2>
<P>   Freeze-dried concentrated and encapsulated mussel tissue in it's raw state was used originally as a natural food supplement for the prevention of pain normally associated with older individuals experiencing joint and muscle discomfort.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POTENCY</H2>
<P>   There is no doubt among scientists who are aware of this state-of-the-art research that LYPRINOL has evolved as the most potent of all these "Super GLA's", regardless of their source. Independent studies carried out in Australia at the University of Queensland have shown LYPRINOL to be:  200 times more potent that Max EPA, 250 times more potent than Green-Lipped Mussel Extract, 350 times more potent than Evening Primrose Oil, 350 times more potent than Salmon Oil and 400 times more potent than Flax Oil.</P>
<P>   Following fifteen years of scientific research by independent scientists working closely with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), the goal was achieved with the identification of the principal components responsible for the extract's high potency. The compounds were patented and named LYPRINOL.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS</H2>
<P>   LYPRINOL has been exposed to critical review by researchers at the Universities of Adelaide and Queensland in Australia. Leukotrienes are formed in the body and are known to be responsible for initiating and prolonging the process of inflammation. These leukotrienes are formed by what researchers call the lipoxygenase pathway.   The concentrated ETA's (eicosatetraenoic acids) contained in LYPRINOL have been shown to be potent inhibitors of this lipoxygenase pathway and this is one reason it is believed that individuals with diets rich in ETA's seem to have less discomfort as they age. And, according to the University of Adelaide scientists, "the results were extraordinary" and "these compounds are really very potent nutritional inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LYPRINOL</H2>
<P>   Most people should begin with two capsules twice a day for one or two weeks. Some may try three times a day during this period. Then, decrease to one or two capsules once or twice a day as desired. The daily level needed to obtain maximum effect can vary for each individual. If your body requires less, temporary initial irritation of symptoms may occur with too high a dosage. If this occurs,  simply decrease the amount taken.   Some individuals with serious needs may not receive maximum benefit from LYPRINOL for four weeks, so it is important to not discontinue too soon.</P>


<BR><BR>
<P>Suggested Use: Two capsules twice a day for seven  to  ten  days,  then  decrease  to  one capsule once or twice a day as desired. More can be taken if needed.</P>
