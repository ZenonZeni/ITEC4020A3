<H3>Abstract. <br> <br> 
</H3>


Colloidal gas Aphrons (CGA's)  are suspensions of micron sized bubbles, 10-100mm in diameter created by rapid stirring of a surfactant solution. They are composed of a gaseous inner core, surrounded by a shell of surfactant molecules. It is thought that the inner surfactant shell of the aphron surrounds the gaseous phase, and a second, outer surfactant shell, encapsulates the inner shell with a water phase. That phase is separate from the bulk phase water. The aphrons have a high degree of stability conferred upon them by these shells, also, because of their small size, they also have a large surface to volume ratio. <br>

Creation of aphrons is achieved by stirring a surfactant solution at speeds of  5000-10000 rpm using a Silverson homogenizer with a high shear rate impeller. The disk is surrounded by a rigid baffles which serves to redirect waves, created by the spinning disk, into the water, creating small bubbles. Once rotating above the minimum speed, the CGA bubbles are produced very rapidly. <br>

CGA’s can be used for the purification of proteins by mixing of the aphron solution with a protein solution . Ionic interactions occur between charged groups on the protein, and charges on the surfactant molecules within the aphrons. These interactions can be optimized by adjusting the pH of the protein solution, which will alter the charge on the protein molecules, and by varying the type of surfactant used, e.g. anionic or cationic surfactants. <br>
The use of  ionic surfactants for purification of proteins in this manner may lead to damage or denaturation of the protein, and therefore may not be suitable for the purification of active peptides, and  therefore a non-ionic surfactants (Tween and Tergitol)  are used for protein purification. Non-Ionic surfactants interact with the protein mainly by hydrophobic interactions, and it is therefore hoped that purification of active proteins can be achieved in this way. Preliminary results will be presented for protein purification using this method. <br> <br> <br>
