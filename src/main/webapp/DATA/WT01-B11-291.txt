<H3>Eliza Nicole!</h3>
This is the only serious stuff on this page. The rest is pure sarcasm. :)<p>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza1.gif" ALT="eliza in the isolette">
Eliza Nicole Lawrence was born on July 22nd, 1995 at 8:09 AM, after only 3 contractions. Wendy had asked for and received the one thing she missed out on when she gave birth to our other daughter, Madison Erica, two and a half years earlier...an epidural.<br><br>4 hours later, the neonatologist informed us that they were transferring Eliza to St. Agnes' Neonatal ICU up in Baltimore. She was having problems regulating her glucose levels. Here she is in her isolette, leads and IV's everywhere.<br><br>What a trooper.

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza3.gif" ALT="daddy and eliza">
While Wendy was in the hospital over the weekend, I went to the NICU to visit Eliza. I was able to hold her hand through an access port in her isolette. The nurses and doctors and the NICU are terrific...they <b>told</b> us things, putting our minds at ease, whereas others in the process didn't.<br><br>It turns out that about 30% of infants born slightly premature and larger than normal have a bit of a problem adjusting their glucose levels. An IV drip that was lessened and eventually removed corrected this imbalance.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza2.gif" ALT="me and wendy and eliza">
We went to St. Agnes every day to feed her and watch the staff do there work. After every feeding, they'd do a "chem strip" test to make sure that Eliza was maintaining her glucose levels between accepted norms.<br><br>Once she was able to do that without the drip, she was started on heavier feedings, and eventually was able to go a full 24 hours without dropping below the minumum. We got a chance to hold her a lot, and the nurses kept telling us how great she was doing. This kept us from becoming basket cases. <br clear=left>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza4.gif" ALT="wendy and eliza">
<br><br>We finally got to bring her home three days after the ordeal began. Wendy got to ride in the back seat all the way home, scrunched between Eliza's car seat and Madison's.<br><br>Stitches and cramps and all, I don't think there's any place else she would have wanted to be.

<h3>OK...enough seriousness...</h3>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/newborn.gif" ALT="me as a baby">
Life began for me on September 20th, 1958 at 8:35 PM. I was born in the exact bed as my mother was 20 years earlier at Cleveland's famed Polyclinic Hospital, and I recall my mother complaining that they still hadn't changed the sheets. <br> <br> Here, my father pauses to admire my Fatty Arbuckle impression before heading down to Dermatology to have his hands surgically separated.

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/reading.gif" ALT="harold and me reading">
My brother and I loved to read. We especially like to read with 3D glasses on, even if the books weren't in 3D. I miss those incredible headaches to this day. <br> <br>I remember my mother placing me on the counter at the Tobin Page drug store on Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland, where I would show off and read the stock quotes from the Plain Dealer for lollipops and the occasional raw fish. <br> <br>If you look closely, you will see the very top of the National Lampoon tucked away inside our Mighty Mouse comic. Now, *that* kept our attention.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/familytv.gif" ALT="the yarnells">
The Yarnells were my parents best friends. They had a TV, and we had a basement that often flooded in those harsh Cleveland Heights springtime thaws. Dave Yarnell, may he rest in peace, was constantly at Thistledown, betting the trifecta, leaving Betty in charge of raising Brucie, Marcie, Tracie and Stacie. <br> <br>Years later, at Stacie's shotgun wedding, Brucie would approach me. "Anything you need, you let me or Anthony know." Anthony cautioned me not to refer to him as 'Brucie' any longer, if I valued being able to speak on the radio.

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/gasmask.gif" ALT="me and mom with gasmasks">
The air in Cleveland was OK, I guess. I never really found out. One morning, I took off on my tricycle from East 105th and Euclid and headed downtown. Got through Collinwood, Hough, and was almost to East 30th when a policeman stopped me.<br> <br> "I'm going to see my mom where she works at Sterling Lindner," I said brightly.<br> <br>He chided me for not wearing a mask so far from home, handed me a spare from the trunk of his cruiser, and patted my head. He then drove away. By the time I got to Sterling Lindner, it was past closing time. A kindly lady in a very short skirt was standing in front of the store. She and her supervisor, Mr. Smith, took time out of their busy work night to return me safely at home.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/newsboy.gif" ALT="delivering the press">
Harold and I had paper routes. He delivered the Plain Dealer, and I delivered the Press. Here is a rare shot of me actually selling the papers, as opposed to sitting on the top stairs of the apartment buildings on Mayfield Road. It was there that I would try my first Swisher Sweet cigar, and it was there that I would first throw up in public.<br> <br>I actually won a trip to Six Gun Territory in Orlando one year for increasing my route by 10 customers. The older carriers who would canvas the neighborhood for new customers, stealing them from the younger boys who actually had routes there, all became strangely ill after a party I held. Mom was right...after a hint or two that it was spiked, they *did* drink the special punch.

Cousin Donna.<br><br>I really don't want to talk about it here.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/theatre.gif" ALT="teen at the movies">
Growing up, the theater was always a big part of my life, especially the joy of standing in line for popcorn and Goobers. My mother used to take our family to the movies, and then sneak out in the middle of the first reel. After six or seven years of this, we all began to suspect that something was up. Here, my sister Elaine tries to stop my mother from sneaking out yet again.<br> <br> That's me in the upper right, hoping to hell that Raquel Welch's top falls off, *just* for a moment, in 3-D. This was taken several days befor my own hand separation surgery.

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/nun.gif" ALT="mary nachtman">
My very first girlfriend, Mary Nachtman. I brought her home to meet my parents, and there was my dad, sitting at the dining room table, shirtless, filling out his driving logs. "Want a sandwich or a beer?" he asked Mary.<br>"No, thank you," she replied.<br><br>"How about a punch in the mouth?" he joked.<br>"Take me home," she demanded.<br><br>She would later enter the convent, muttering all the while and claiming she was saying the Rosary whenever someone noticed.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/promnite.gif" ALT="mike curry and me">
Prom night, 1976. Mike Curry and his date, John Bailey and his date, and I and my date all board the bus to the Iron Gate for dinner. Surf and turf had just topped $15 and I was ready. The waitress kept calling me Toots. <br><br>I had an great time that night with my girlfriend, Fawn Archambault, and later, she would surprise me by spending time in my back seat with John Rego. And Milo Swanson. And every other boy in the senior class except Brian Uveges, since he wasn't there. She was too tired to go to Cedar Point the next day.

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/pantyrad.gif" ALT="fun at ohio state">
I went to Ohio State, and majored in both Computer and Information Science and Broadcast Communications. I also learned that the best friends you'll ever have are the ones you have when you're stealing underwear from the women. The Stadium Dorm is far and away the best place on campus to live, and if it wasn't for being caught in the Unit D utility room in a comprimising position with Arlene Wichter, I might have stayed there for longer than just one year.<br><br>Here, the boys of Unit V display the catch of the day.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/ax.gif" ALT="my first radio job">
My first program director, E. Karl, offering me some pointers. <br><br>At WNCI, they had unusual motivational techniques.

<hr>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/dancers.gif" ALT="dance competition">
Along with being on the radio, I also was the DJ at a swanky private nightclub in Upper Arlington called Whisper. We used to have incredibly exciting dance competitions, and the crowds (shown here) would clamor for a good seat.<br><br>It was here that my reputation as a club DJ led to the first of several Billboard DJ of the year awards, as well as several treatable communicable diseases.<br><br><br><br>I still have most of the 12 inch records from my nightclub career, and someday, I'll find a couple of Technics SL-MKII turntables, a GLI mixer, a JBL amp and some Klipsch speakers, and really piss off my neighbors.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/newlywed.gif" ALT="my first marriage">
Me and my first wife, Kim. We were married for one year to the day. It was just too hard to balance everything, so we just dropped it.

<hr>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/headgear.gif" ALT="my sister Elaine">
My sister Elaine is actually much prettier than it looks here. She always would come to the openings of the clubs I played at and the events that the radio stations would hold. She's a hair designer, and, as you can see, she's also a fairly competent HVAC engineer.<br><br>Unfortunately, this well-intentioned attempt at marrying the two passions in her life failed to gel properly.

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/rolderby.gif" ALT="roller derby">
If there was anything in life I wish I had done, it was to be a member of America's Dream Team, the LA Thunderbirds. In the world of Danny Reilly, Ronnie Rains and #747, Big Mama, the circular battlefield of roller derby is poised to make a comeback. You mark my words. And maybe, just maybe, <b>I'll</b> be the one wearing the helmet, getting whipped from the jam, screaming around the track and hipchecking my way to a clean score. And just as I touch my hands to my hips to signal the end of the jam, a chair will come flying through the air. They'll go to a commercial, then come back to see if I'm still alive. <br><br>Man, that's living.
