<H4>3. STANDARD PRACTICE AND RESEARCH EXCELLENCE</H4>
<BR>
If there are well defined standards, it places research and development
into context and protects it from being confused with operational production.
Research is needed in cases where the standard processing is inadequate,
where it does not solve the user's problems and also needed to create new
products which may eventually become standard processes. The important advance
for researchers in this situation is that when users ask researchers to
try new methods because the standard ones are inadequate it is they, and
not the researchers, who take on the risk that the result may not be any
better.<BR>
<BR>
Having a solid base of established standards also puts into context the
difficult issue of &quot;Best Practice&quot;. I think the name is the problem!
It is always better to use &quot;Best Current Practice&quot; and even better
just to say &quot;Standard Practice&quot;. I think that 'best practice'
is actually what the 'best people' do and always will be. It is impossible
to specify the 'best' or create it by documentation and imposition of measures
of success. What it is possible to specify is the currently acceptable standards
and it is in everyone's interest that these standards exist and provide
a measure against which new methods can prove their worth.<BR>
<BR>
The area where research lives is in the quest for the best but it may not
be that current research really is better. The measure of 'better' to the
user lies as much in repeatability and consistency as it does in the incorporation
of more 'realistic' components or complex physics. However, the researcher
needs to have room to explore and can move the horisons to create what may
be tommorrow's standards.<BR>
<BR>
An example of such a slow but sure process can be seen in evaporation methods
as practiced in Irrigation Engineering. In evaporation standard practice
the scientifically superior Penman-Monteith method has taken many years
(more than 30) to become included in the standard manuals. It has had to
be proven in operational practice to be simply applicable, reliable, consistent
and even conservative so that it could replace tried although maybe not
very true methods in use for many years in operational calculations of &quot;Consumptive&quot;
Water Use.<BR>
