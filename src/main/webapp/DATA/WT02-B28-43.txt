<B><FONT SIZE=4>Weekly Economic Commentary</FONT></B>
<P>
<I>For the week of December 2, 1996 <BR>
</I>
<P>
Bond yields fell and stock prices rose in response to mixed evidence
on economic growth, accompanied by continued good news on inflation.
Third quarter growth was revised downward, but with less inventory
accumulation going into the fourth quarter. Personal income was
unchanged in October, but consumer spending was stronger than
expected. Construction expenditures also rose strongly in October,
as strength in government and private nonresidential categories
more than offset weakness in residential. October new home sales
were down more than expected. The Purchasing Managers' Index rebounded
in November, showing a pick-up in the manufacturing sector, but
the prices paid index declined, indicating no build up of inflation
pressures.<BR>

<P>
<B>Downward revision in 3rd quarter growth</B> 
<P>
Real GDP growth for the third quarter was revised downward to
2.0 percent from a previously estimated 2.2 percent. The sharpest
downward revisions, however, were in net exports and the rate
of inventory accumulation -- a positive sign for the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending, capital investment, and government purchases
were revised upward.<BR>

<P>
<B>Personal income flat, consumer spending stronger</B>
<P>
Personal income was unchanged in October after rising 0.6 percent
in both August and September. Wage and salary income declined
as a decline in average weekly hours more than offset an increase
in employment. However, personal consumption expenditures rose
a stronger than expected 0.5 percent after an increase of only
0.1 percent the month before.<BR>

<P>
<B>Consumer confidence unchanged in November</B>
<P>
The Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence was 107.3
in November, the same relatively high level as in October. This
is good news for the holiday shopping season. <BR>

<P>
<B>Construction spending up sharply</B>
<P>
Total construction spending was up a stronger than expected 1.8
percent in October, following a rise of 1.2 percent the month
before. The increase was led by government and private nonresidential
spending. The residential construction category showed a decline.

<P>
<B>New home sales down again</B>
<P>
Sales of new single family homes fell a steeper than expected
8.7 percent in October. This follows a 4.5 percent decline in
September and leaves new home sales at their lowest level since
March.<BR>

<P>
<B>Purchasing managers report rebound in manufacturing growth</B>
<P>
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a higher than expected
52.7 percent in November after falling to 50.2 percent the month
before. Production, employment, new orders, vendor deliveries,
and inventories all contributed to the rise. Nevertheless, the
prices paid index declined from 47.1 percent to 45.9 percent,
indicating a faster rate of decline in prices.<BR>
