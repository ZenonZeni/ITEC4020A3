  <A NAME=hath>Can Hathaway Shirtmakers be Saved?</A>
</H1>
<P>
<B>One hundred and fifty-nine years ago C. F. Hathaway opened a shirt factory
in Waterville, Maine. It is the oldest shirt factory in the United States.
While it may be old on the outside, it is state-of-the art efficiency on
the inside.</B>
<P>
<B>In 1960 apparel conglomerate Warnaco bought Hathaway. Now, 49 year-old
Linda Wachner, CEO of the Warnaco, announced that Hathaway will be closed
down. It sounds like the same old story that we have heard time and time
again of ineffecient American plants being put out of business by foreign
competition.</B>
<P>
<B>But Hathaway is very efficient and has been getting more so. In January
of 1995 it cost Hathaway $124.53 to produce a dozen shirts, or a little more
than $10 each. Not bad for shirts that retail for $50 or more. However, Cornell
University Professor Peter Lazes worked with the plant to make it even more
efficient. And, as of March, 1996, the cost to make a dozen shirts fell to
$62.89, or $5.24 each. At the same time, with a slightly reduced work force,
the plant produced 36,612 shirts per week, up from 21,828 per week, and
astounding 68% increase in productivity.</B>
<P>
<B>Wachner visited the plant in January, 1995 and promised workers that she
would not close the plant if quality work continued and the cost of a shirt
came down. From our point of view, and from a legal perspective as well,
Wachner and Warnaco breached its agreement with the 500 workers at the Waterville
plant. They cut costs considerably and are now told that they are being cut
loose by the company.</B>
<P>
<B>Warnaco has refused to give details of the profitability of the plant.
It claims that Hathaway loses money, which it may, because Warnaco has not
advertised the Hathaway brand for six years. Remember those old eye-patch
commercials with celebrities wearing their Hathaway dress shirts?</B>
<P>
<B>At the same time that she is effectively firing 500 mostly female workers,
Mrs. Wachner is earning $10 million a year, unbelievably more than the entire
workforce at the Hathaway factory. The average employee in Waterville makes
about $15,000 per year.</B>
<P>
<B>Made in the USA Foundation is working to help the employees at Hathaway
buy the plant. It is working with union, financial, politicians and other
leaders to find the right combination to make Hathaway a viable company
again.</B>
<P>
<B>If Hathaway shirts were available at retail outlets, consumers would buy
them. Warnaco wounded Hathaway, but lets hope that it lets the plant continue
in business.</B>

  <B>Why Buy American Products?</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>Many of you are familiar with Made in the USA advertising and the importance
of buying goods produced by American workers. Not only does the Made in the
USA label ensure that jobs are kept in the United States, but it also has
proven an effective marketing strategy for businesses. </B>
<P>
<B>Buying American benefits both workers and corporations, instilling a pride
in U.S. citizens about our economy and our manufacturing processes. We at
the Made in the USA Foundation hope to raise public awareness about quality
American goods and the obstacles that our companies face competing in a global
economy.</B>
<P>
<H3>
</H3>
<H3>
  <B>What is the Made in the USA Foundation?</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>The Made in the USA Foundation (MUSA) was formed in 1989 by a coalition
of individuals, trade unions and corporations who were concerned about American
competitiveness and economic leadership. MUSA is now a 60,000 member independent
and non-partisan organization which has been approved by the Internal Revenue
Service as a non-profit foundation. Donations to MUSA are tax-deductible.</B>
<P>
<B>The basic premise of the Foundation is that strong and effective action
must be taken to reduce American reliance on imports, to increase purchases
of U.S. products domestically and overseas and to ensure that the standards
of fair trade are applied evenly around the world.</B>
<H3>
</H3>
<H3>
  <B>What Does the Foundation Stand For?</B>
</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>Consumers have a right to know where products are manufactured. This
    information should appear on product labels and in product advertising.</B>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>American environmental and worker safety laws should not be undermined
    by imports which do not meet these standards.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Reciprocity is the benchmark for all bilateral trade. We should not allow
    foreign countries to do in this country what our companies are prohibited
    from doing in theirs.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign companies that dump products in the United States below manufacturing
    costs should be dealt with firmly.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign government subsidies of manufactured and agricultural products
    should be aggressively opposed.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign products produced by child labor, slave or prison labor should
    be banned from the United States.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign barriers to American products should be attacked aggressively.</B>
</UL>
<P>
<B>The Foundation supports promoting American-made products in the USA and
abroad through advertising and public relations efforts.</B>

  <A NAME=home>The Homeless: Another Casualty in the Trade Wars</A>
</H1>
<P>
<B>The homeless are everywhere and nowhere. In a nation that prides itself
on keeping statistics about every conceivable economic activity, it is remarkable
that there is no reliable data on the extent of homelessness. </B>
<P>
<B>Everyone agrees that homelessness started a dramatic increase in the 1970s
and 1980s. Republican Jack Kemp, former chairman of the Interagency Council
on the Homeless said, "Today's homelessness started to become a highly visible
and recognized problem in many cities in the late 1970s and early 1980s."
In the 1950s and 1960s seeing a homeless person was indeed a rarity. Now
it seems you trip over them even in the best of neighborhoods. </B>
<P>
<B>Who are the homeless? Three-quarters of the homeless are single men. Nearly
half of them are veterans. Most of these vets were once productive blue-collar
workers who were laid off either by "downsizing" or because of the relocation
of plants overseas. </B>
<P>
<B>Homelessness is next to joblessness and both are caused by our massive
trade deficits. In the early 1970s we did not have a trade deficit&Aring;our
exports and imports were nearly equal. We also did not have a massive
homelessness problem. And then the floodgates opened. Until 1973 we did not
trade with China at all. We had a small trade deficit with Japan then as
the first waves of Toyotas, Hondas and Datsuns were invading our shores in
small battalions. </B>
<P>
<B>The vast rise in our trade deficit is mirrored by an alarming rise in
the homeless population. Now families are joining shelters where only males
used to flee. It used to be that an American with a high school degree could
get a decent job with a predictable future and buy a decent home. Now,
alarmingly, home ownership is declining for the first time in American history.
Many of us are only one paycheck away from poverty and from losing our homes
or apartments. Ten thousand Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure
every month and many times that number are thrown out onto the streets by
court-ordered evictions. </B>
<P>
<B>Homelessness is one of the hidden costs of the trade wars. When American
consumers buy cheap Chinese shoes, Malaysian clothing and Taiwanese electronics
we are also buying unemployment and homelessness in America. Besides losing
jobs and homes, we lose tax revenues and drain our unemployment funds. Why
do you think that we have had federal budget deficits for the last two decades?
Because we are losing our tax base. Incomes have not increased in twenty
years, they have actually declined. We are the only major nation to suffer
this fate, so I do not blame international trade alone. I blame the American
government and the trade negotiators for getting us bad trade agreements
and by failing to enforce our own trade and tariff laws. </B>
<P>
<B>For example, federal law provides that imported trucks are subject to
a 25% duty. Cars are subject to a duty of only 2.5%. The Japan lobby has
succeeded in having Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Izusu trucks and minivans
classified as cars for duty purposes, but as trucks for safety and other
purposes. The British-made Range Rover pulled the Shetland wool over somebody's
eyes when it convinced the feds that its $60,000 off-road vehicles were trucks
in order to escape the luxury tax, but were cars to escape the truck duty.
It should be the other way around- Rovers are certainly luxury vehicles and
should be taxed as such, and they are trucks for duty purposes. Each Rover
should bring the federal government $10,000 or more in revenues but brings
in only about $1,000. When Range Rovers cost a mere $40,000, Murphy Brown
said it made more sense to buy a Ford Explorer and strap $20,000 in cash
to the hood- you would get the same effect. </B>
<P>
<B>By circumventing import duties these imported trucks not only cost American
jobs they cost the U.S. treasury $1.2 billion dollars annually. I estimate
that we could build 30,000 homes for the homeless (at $40,000 each) with
these revenues. This in turn would create tens of thousands of jobs for plumbers,
carpenters, masons and others. </B>
<P>
<B>Foreign corporations have found countless ways for dodging American taxes.
Japanese and European corporations set up importing subsidiaries in this
country: Toyota of America, Mercedes Benz of North America and so forth.
Most of these foreign corporations pay little or no income tax in the United
States. They do this slight-of-hand trick by claiming that they make no income
here by overcharging their own subsidiaries. Their accountants miraculously
transfer profits back to Tokyo or Munich or London. The Internal Revenue
Service has tried unsuccessfully to go after these companies because many
Japanese parent corporations refuse to turn over documents to the U.S.
government. President Clinton promised to close this gaping loophole, but
has not done so thus far. This loophole costs American taxpayers tens of
billions of dollars every year, strengthens our trade opponents and makes
balancing the U.S. budget that much harder. </B>
<P>
<B>We should deny most favored nation status to China- it doesn't deserve
it and trading with China costs several hundred thousand jobs. The symptoms
of our trade deficits are everywhere to be found. Next time you see a homeless
person, let him inspire you to write your congressman or the president and
strengthen your desire to buy only American products. Most homeless people
are casualties of our trade wars and should be constant reminders that we
are in a battle for economic survival.</B>
<P>
<B>Without changing our laws, just by enforcing existing laws, we can turn
the trade war around. </B>

  <B><A NAME=child>We Are Aiding and Abetting Child Slavery</A></B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Recently you bought your son or daughter a new soccer ball. There is a
good chance that the ball was made by someone your child's age or even younger.
Fully half of the soccer balls sold in the United States are made in Pakistan
(some sold as Nike products), and every one of those soccer balls had an
assist from a child under 14 who toils 10 hours a day in subhuman sweatshops,
stitching the ball or cutting material used to make it.</B>
<P>
<B>This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children worldwide,
some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production line.
Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human rights
abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children between the ages of
10 and 14. </B>
<P>
<B>These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugs
and countless other products that are flooding the American market and driving
hard-working Americans out of jobs.</B>
<P>
<B>More than 60 years ago the United States banned child labor, sweatshops,
long workdays and workweeks. But now we are subsidizing, encouraging and
failing to criticize the enslavement of young people in the Third World.
The so-called 'Third Wave", boosted by President Clinton and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich in the form of GATT and the World Trade Organization prohibits
member nations like the United States from discriminating against the importation
of goods made by children.</B>
<P>
<B>Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much that they buy
them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or for the settlement
of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only four years
old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young son for
less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving loom most
of the time, tying tiny knots 10 hours a day. Carpetmakers like the young
weavers because their tiny fingers can make very tight knots, and also because
they are cheap to own and maintain. Masih was a free person by the age of
12 and crusaded against the horrors of child labor. In November 1994 Iqbal
spoke on the abysmal conditions in the sweat shops of Pakistan at the
international labor conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The next month, he was
given a Youth Action award in Boston. Shockingly, in March 1995 he was gunned
down in his village in Pakistan while riding his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman
of the Bonded Labor Front, a group fighting child labor, said, "We know his
death was a conspiracy by the carpet mafia." </B>
<P>
<B>While Pakistan has laws against child labor and slavery, the government
has taken very little action to combat it. Only a boycott by the United States
and other nations will have any impact on slave-based industries like the
rug manufacturers.</B>
<P>
<B>Nike similarly bases its operations on finding the lowest-cost labor to
make its athletic shoes. Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian sweatshops
70 hours a week making Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of glue. Blue
jeans and cheap clothing made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves of American
shops like K-Mart and Wal-Mart. The United States needs to take a leadership
role in eradicating child labor around the globe. If we are punished for
violating GATT for doing so, let us confront it head on. </B>
<P>
<B>Child labor is a human rights issue. What is more of a human right than
growing up a free person, attending school without being shackled to medieval
machinery?Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label that
says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia, that
a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed his
or her labor to that product. Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't
buy clothing and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator,
Congressman and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest
abuse of human rights: child labor. And then buy the American-made alternative.
</B>
<P>
<B>The Made in the USA Foundation is sponsoring a new effort to combat child
labor around the globe called CAUSE, Children Against Underage Servitude
and Employment. CAUSE is run by children in America. CAUSE will provide materials
for students and teachers explaining how children are exploited around the
world and deprived of a real childhood. You can write to CAUSE care of Made
in the USA Foundation, 1925 K Street, N.W. Suite 100, Washington, DC 20006.
Its a good cause and one that children can get excited about. Perhaps it
will take American children to make Congress take action against child slavery
around the world. </B><IMG SRC=bluebds.gif>

<H1>
  <B><A NAME=raise>Let's Give America A Raise</A></B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Neither the Democrat nor the Republican tax cut or minimum wage proposals
help make the U.S. economy more competitive. Neither plan helps small businesses.
I am proposing a tax reform plan that makes American companies more competitive,
reduces paperwork and helps those earning less than $30,000 per year. It
does all of these without increasing the budget deficit. At the same time
it also provides an increase in the minimum wage without increasing unemployment.
It may sound impossible, or even magical- I call it "trickle up economics."</B>
<P>
<B>My proposal is quite simple: modify the social security tax by creating
an exemption and eliminating the ceiling. Currently, social security taxes
(FICA and medicare) are the most regressive taxes we have. For someone earning
$15,000 per year the social security tax bite is a whopping $2,245, half
paid by the employee and half by the employer. I propose that the first $15,000
of income be exempt from social security and medicare taxes, for both workers
and employers. According to the Tax Foundation (a non-profit think tank that
studies taxation issues), this exemption will cost the U.S. treasury $40
billion, while pumping $20 billion into the hands of those needing it most,
plus another $20 billion into their employer's pockets. </B>
<P>
<B>Social security and medicare taxes currently are imposed only on the first
$60,600 of wages. Those earning one million dollars per year pay no more
in social security taxes than a taxpayer earning $75,000 annually. This tax
ceiling is illogical and unfair. These taxes are not based on benefits, they
are based on the ability to pay. And a multimillionaire can certainly afford
to pay more than a working man earning $75,000 a year. </B>
<P>
<B>Even Steve Forbes' flat tax did not have a ceiling. (My proposal is a
flat tax, and if Republicans like flat taxes they should endorse ending the
ceiling on social security taxes.) By eliminating the ceiling on wages subject
to social security taxes, the Tax Foundation estimates that we will raise
$64 billion in new revenues. This no doubt could be called Robin Hood tax
reform: taking from the rich and giving to the poor. The $24 billion surplus
can either be retained by the treasury to reduce the federal deficit, or
it can be spread around as a benefit to those earning less than $30,000 per
year.</B>
<P>
<B>This tax reform will also end the "nanny tax" problem for those employing
child-care workers at home: if a nanny is paid less than $15,000 per year
(and most are) she (or he) will get more take-home pay and her employer will
save money and not be required to file quarterly and annual tax forms.</B>
<P>
<B>In the real world, where American factories compete with those in Mexico
and Korea, this reform will make the United States much more competitive.
Take, for example, an assembly worker paid $7.50 to put electronic products
together. He or she now makes $15,000 in gross salary, and nets several thousand
dollars less because of taxes, including a substantial social security tax
bite of $1,122.50, nearly $100 a month. The employee will get an immediate
raise in take-home pay. At the same time, the employer will save an equal
amount for each employee. With 100 employees, a tidy $100,000 will be added
to the employer's bottom line. The employer will thus improve its profitability
and be more likely to keep its plant in the United States open for
business.</B>
<P>
<B>Who else will this reform benefit? Students are often paid under $7.50
per hour. Restaurant workers, many in the textile industry and in general
those in semi-skilled occupations will benefit. Those earning more than $60,000
per year will pay more social security taxes, but even the rich will benefit
by saving taxes (and paperwork) for their nannies, servants and chauffeurs.
And if they own a business, the rich will benefit from the new exemption.
This change will give America what it needs, a raise, at no cost to the
economy.</B>

  <A NAME=labels>Testimony on Country of Origin Labels</A>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Joel D. Joseph, Chairman of the Foundation was the first witness called
by the International Trade Commission on April 10 concerning the country
of origin labeling of products. Excerpts of his testimony:</B>
<P>
<B>There are many deceptive practices being used by companies trying to appear
to be U.S. manufacturers. The U.S. Lock Company, for example, does not make
locks in the United States. FloridaGold orange juice may come from Brazil:
The label states that the product conducts orange juice from Florida and/or
Brazil. But what is it? Florida juice or Brazilian juice? American consumers,
and consumers from around the world, have the right to know. </B>
<P>
<B>We don't want Florida orange juice to come from any other place. We want
Idaho potatoes from Idaho, Long Island duckling from Long Island and Vermont
maple syrup from Vermont. Maple Grove Farms of Vermont sells maple syrup
that may be from Vermont or may be from Canada. The label is clearly
deceptive.</B>
<P>
<B>There is a case pending before the courts in the United States about Swiss
Army knives that are made in China. I don't believe that the Swiss Army has
ever left that country, and most certainly never made it to China. The Made
in the USA Foundation supports the Swiss manufacturer in its claim that Swiss
Army knives can only be made in Switzerland. </B>
<P>
<B>Similarly, Americans and others would assume that Milwaukee tools are
made in Milwaukee, that Virginia hams come from Virginia and that Rockport
shoes come from Rockport. Milwaukee tools are indeed made in Wisconsin and
Virginia pigs are the source of Virginia hams, but Rockport shoes are made
elsewhere. Similarly L.A. Gear shoes are not made in Los Angeles, although
most consumers would believe that L.A. Gear products are made in Southern
California. American cities, states and regions deserve the same respect
as those in Europe- if a manufacturer wants to use an American geographical
name it must manufacture the product here. </B>

  <B><A NAME=bumper>New Bumper Stickers</A></B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Made in the USA Foundation has produced four new bumper stickers pictured
on this page and on the back cover. The actual size of the stickers is 3
x 11 inches. All of the stickers are white and blue and were made at a union
plant. We are selling the stickers for $1.00 each, a dozen for $10, 100 for
$75 and 1,000 for $500. Call us with your order at 800/USA-PRIDE or use the
order form on this page. The stickers can be used by companies or local unions
as a part of a "Buy American" campaign. Most Americans do not realize that
Nike uses child laborers to make its athletic shoes in Indonesia and to produce
soccer balls under its logo in Pakistan. These children are "paid" from six
to fourteen cents per hour. Some of these unfortunate children were sold
into slavery by their parents for $15 to $20. Do your part to oppose child
labor. </B>
<P>
<B>There is no charge for shipping and handling.</B>
