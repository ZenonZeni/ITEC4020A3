<h2>Correctional Populations in the United States 1980 - 1993 </h2>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics Executive Summary</b> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Office of Justice Programs</b> </p>

<p> The Nation's correctional population jumped more than 2 1/2
times from 1980 through 1993. During 1993 approximately 2.6% of
the U.S. population--4.9 million adults--were on parole, on
probation, or in jails or prisons, an increase of 3 million
people since 1980. More than 909,000 men and women were in the
custody of State and Federal prisons, 455,500 were in local
jails, 671,000 on parole, and 2.8 million on probation: </p>

<p> --More than two-thirds of the 4.9 million persons under
correctional supervision were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> --The Nation's parole population had the fastest rate of
growth, 205% from 1980 to 1993. </p>

<p> --During the 13 years between 1980 and 1993, the probation
population grew by more than 1.7 million, larger than the
increase in any other correctional population. </p>

<p> --In 1993 nearly 1.4 million offenders were in local jail and
State or Federal prison. </p>

<p> During the 1980-92 period, the percent of black State and
Federal prisoners increased from 46.5% to 50% at a time when the
percentage of blacks in the general population increased from
11.8% to 12.4%. The Hispanic prison population doubled from 7.7%
to 14.1%, while Hispanics in the general population increased
from 6.5% to 9.5%. </p>

<p> At yearend 1992, there were 4,094 black male inmates per
100,000 black adults in the U.S. population, compared to 502
white male inmates per 100,000 adult white residents. Among U.S.
adults who neither graduated from high school nor earned a
general equivalence degree (GED), almost 6% of blacks and 1% of
whites were in a Federal or State prison serving a sentence of a
year or more. </p>

<p> The number of convicted drug offenders increased ninefold
(from 19,000 to 172,300) from 1980 through 1992. The number of
violent offenders accounted for a larger share of the growth in
the total prison population (41%, compared to 32% for drug
offenders). The total number of violent offenders in State prison
increased by nearly 200,000 during the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The number of returned parole violators and newly admitted
probation violators soared between 1980 and 1992. Almost 1 in
every 3 offenders admitted to State prisons (142,000) in 1992
were probation or parole violators, compared to 1 in every 6
(27,000) in 1980. </p>

<p> Violent offenders were more likely to be sent to prison in
1992 than they were in 1980. Relative to the number of victims of
murder, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, the number of
violent offenders admitted to State prison increased during the
12-year period, from 18 admissions per 1,000 violent
victimizations to 27 per 1,000. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the rate of incarceration in State and
Federal prisons more than doubled, from 139 sentenced inmates
(inmates serving 1 year or more) per 100,000 U.S. residents to
332 per 100,000. In 1992 incarceration rates were nearly 19 times
higher among adult men than among adult women (883 per 100,000
compared to 47) and 8 times higher among adult black men than
among adult white men. </p>

<p> The data are from a 188-page book published by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) and listing the correctional populations
of each State and the Federal system. The book lists jail and
prison suicide statistics, correctional crowding, electronic
monitoring, sentence commutations, jail AIDS deaths and much
more. Single copie&quot;s of the publication, &quot;Correctional
Populations in the United States, 1992, (NCJ-146413), written by
BJS statistician Tracy L. Snell, may be obtained from the BJS
Clearinghouse, Box 179, Annapolis Junction, Maryland 20701-0179,
telephone 1-800-732-3277. Fax orders with name, address, title,
and NCJ </p>

<p> number to 410-792-4358. </p>

<p> Data from tables and graphs used in many BJS reports can be
obtained in spreadsheet files on 5. and 3. inch diskettes by
calling 202-307-0784. </p>

<p> Note: BJS expects to release population counts for prisoners
in State and Federal prisons at yearend 1994, Prisoners in 1994,
in early June. </p>
