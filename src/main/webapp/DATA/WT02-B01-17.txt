<h2>Pot (Drugs) are Dangerous - How to Deal with the Argument </h2>

<p> <strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p> You have heard the argument before: </p>

<p> <strong>Pot is dangerous. It causes cancer, auto accidents,
grows hair on your palms, and makes you go blind.</strong> </p>

<p> This is a guide on how to deal with this argument in all
sorts of easy ways. Some of these arguments were developed during
debates with doctors, so some of them assume that the opponent is
a doctor. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">General
Discussion </h3>

<p> First, it is generally pointless to get tied up in debating
the details of health issues or, in general, any supposed danger
of drugs. The reason is that you get so wound up in trading
scientific references that you never get to the real bottom line
-- prison. Dr. So-and-So (who the audience doesn't know anyway)
says X, Dr. Whositt, says Y -- so what? </p>

<p> Net result -- you convince nobody. Once you have won your
main point, and established that criminal punishment is not an
effective approach to the problem -- no matter what you have
assumed about the dangers -- then you can go back and, at your
leisure, knock down their health evidence as well. </p>

<p> My approach -- conceding all their evidence up front -- does
a complete end run. They expect me to argue that pot doesn't
cause cancer, etc. When I don't, and jump to the bottom line
policy issue (prison), they are completely disarmed. They really
don't know what to do. They never thought about their logical
non-sequitir (Because XXXXX is dangerous, therefore prison is the
solution) and are completely unprepared to deal with arguments
which address the logical disconnect. Once they are sitting there
with a stunned expression on their face -- knowing they have been
completely cut off -- then I come back with the mop up campaign
of addressing the health risks and comparing them with other
health risks for which we do not put people in jail. By that
time, they will be doing little but nodding their head and
agreeing. </p>

<p> I remember one debate in which my opponent showed up with a
whole stack of medical references on the harmful effects of
drugs. A few minutes into the debate he closed his folder and
never opened it again. Of course, as always, he conceded and
agreed with me. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">The
Specific Responses </h3>

<p> Now for the specific responses: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ok, you convinced me. Let's assume everything you say is
        true and it grows hair on your palms besides. How many
        millions of people do you suppose we ought to throw in
        prison for best results? </li>
    <li>Let's assume all the evidence you presented is 100
        percent accurate. The evidence you presented shows that
        pot is perhaps three times as carcinogenic as cigarettes.
        What does this mean in terms of policy? Does it mean that
        the penalties for pot should be three times the penalties
        for cigarettes? Then, of course, there should be even
        higher penalties for cigars and chewing tobacco, right? </li>
    <li>So the argument is XXXXXX causes cancer. Therefore, the
        law is really based on trying to prevent people from
        doing things which might give them cancer, right? Should
        we have laws against staying out in the sun too long,
        eating cheeseburgers, or smoking tobacco? </li>
    <li>The reasons you have stated never did have anything to do
        with why the laws were passed in the first place. Please
        answer two questions: Why were the drug laws passed in
        the first place? When did the concerns over cancer become
        the reason behind the laws? </li>
    <li>If your concern is really the carcinogens, then we can
        just require that the active ingredient be distributed in
        its pure form. Or what if someone only uses it by
        distilling the active ingredient (a simple process) and
        thereby takes no carcinogens? Shouldn't they be free from
        penalties? </li>
    <li>Gosh, you convinced me. Let's solve the problem right
        away. We will elect you King so you can do _anything_ you
        want. And ... every pot smoker in America is lined up
        outside your door with a bag of dope in one hand and a
        signed confession in the other. Now what? </li>
    <li>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prohibition
        only multiplied the bad effects which already exist with
        drugs. For example, overdoses become more likely because
        users don't know what they are getting; there are no
        standards for drug purity so there is greater harm from
        contaminants, addicts are less likely to receive
        effective treatment, etc. The more you assume about the
        harmful effects of drugs, the more imperative it becomes
        to address them in a non-criminal manner. </li>
    <li>Your evidence states that pot may be a problem while
        driving. Let's assume (for the sake of argument) that
        this is true. Do we attempt to solve the problem of drunk
        driving by throwing wine and beer drinkers in jail? Why
        not? (Can you say &quot;misapplication of
        resources&quot;?) </li>
    <li>The argument that pot was found in the bloodstreams of
        any group of people who died from any cause is not
        indicative of anything other than that they might have
        used pot some time within the last two months before they
        died. It does not say anything about all the people who
        may have pot in their bloodstreams and still be alive and
        well. It doesn't even say anything about _why_ they died.
        For comparison purposes, as any competent doctor knows,
        we need control groups. </li>
    <li>We must be wary of false comparisons (as any competent
        doctor should know). For example, we had one previous
        example in which large numbers of people were dying with
        pot in their bloodstreams. It was called Vietnam. Pot
        smokers had a high death rate, but it had nothing to do
        with pot. </li>
    <li>Pot causes cancer. Therefore, the best approach to the
        problem is to put millions of people in prison. This is
        the basic argument. Can you say &quot;non-sequitir&quot;?
        Where did you get the idea that if something is a health
        hazard, we ought to throw people in prison? </li>
    <li>Name all the other health problems for which prison is
        the recommended treatment. </li>
    <li>Please make a list of the comparable health problems
        caused by say, alcohol, and then match the health
        problems with the appropriate criminal penalties. </li>
    <li>Then maybe you can tell me why every major study of drug
        policy in the last fifty years recommended
        decriminalization. (See the list of Biggest Studies of
        Drug Policy on my web page.) </li>
    <li>You know, we can dispense with all the details and cut to
        the bottom line. Rather than argue the details of what it
        <strong>_might_</strong> cause, we can take a look at the
        actual stats on what it <strong>_does_</strong> cause.
        When we look at the official stats, such as deaths from
        any pot-related cause, the numbers are trivial in
        comparison with the damage done by alcohol and tobacco.
        We are spending 99 percent of our budget on one percent
        of the real drug problems. </li>
</ol>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">If Your
Opponent is a Doctor </h3>

<p> 16) Hey, Doc! What is the first rule of addressing a health
problem? First, do no harm. Right? Putting people in prison does
significant harm long before they are likely to get cancer. </p>

<p> If my opponent is a doctor I will hammer him on points just
like the one above. If he is really concerned about pot as a
health issue then, by God, he ought to be ready to address that
part of the problem as he would any other health issue. Would he
put people in prison for non-marital sex in order to prevent
venereal disease? Obviously he wouldn't. Hit him with his own
values and evidence. </p>

<p> And, if he is a doctor, I would hammer him repeatedly on the
fact that he really didn't know anything about the subject. Like:
</p>

<p> So tell me why the Consumers Union Report on Licit and
Illicit Drugs said that prohibition was the worst thing we could
do for drug-related health problems. You haven't read it have
you? The big problem here is ignorance, Doctor. It is one thing
to read some medical literature about the harm these things can
do and it is quite another to make the leap to an effective
public policy. Your problem, Doctor, is that you have read some
of the medical evidence but haven't read the evidence on drug
policy. Ignorance is a shameful thing in someone with as much
education as you have. </p>

<p> In short, if I am in a debate with a doctor, he will fall
before I am done -- because he is a doctor. I will goad him into
reading the CU Report by taunting him, calling him ignorant,
cajoling him, or anything else I have to do. I will force him to
either read what I have read or look like a public fool. Once
they read it, they always concede. For example, see my much
earlier post &quot;Cliff Converts Doc&quot;. It was written by a
doctor who fought me tooth and nail and then wound up telling
everyone that I was right. Excerpts of my debate with him are
posted on my web page. <br>
