<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>





The next major test of the mutual fund industry will probably come when the world economy enjoys such a prolonged boom that inflation revives to a level which compels the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by more than it did during 1994.  The Fed doubled the level of U.S. short-term interest rates two years ago but real interest rates did not exceed 3.0% and the economy slowed so abruptly in the months after the Mexican financial crisis that the Fed was able to ease interest rates during the summer of 1995.  If, by contrast, the economy had remained strong through 1995, short-term interest rates might have risen to 7.0-8.0% and provoked far larger redemptions in bond funds as well as a correction in the equity market large enough to encourage net redemptions of equity funds.

<P>

In the modern era, the primary channel through which monetary policy influenced the economy was the housing market.  In the era of Regulation Q ceilings on interest rates, monetary tightening would divert savings flows from thrift institutions and choke off  the supply of mortgage funds for housing.  After deregulation of the thrift industry, the Fed slowed the economy by pushing up interest rates to levels which depressed the demand for money in all sectors.  Such monetary tightening also sometimes encouraged dollar appreciation which increased the trade deficit.  As a result of the household sector's growing exposure to the stock and bond markets through mutual funds, changes in the value of household equity portfolios could emerge as a more important channel for monetary policy to influence the economy than in the past.  Most econometric research has shown a weak link between consumer spending and stock market fluctuations because of the heavy concentration of equity ownership in the top 10% of the population as measured by wealth, but the parameters of this relationship could gradually change if equities continue to expand as a share of household assets and ownership becomes more diffused throughout the population.  At present, the group which is probably most sensitive to the stock market driven changes in wealth is the households over the age of 65.  They own far more equity than any other group and have little wage and salary income.  In the past, they were referred to as fixed income people but as a result of the buoyant performance of financial markets compared to real wages during recent years, it is now people in their 20's and 30's, not senior citizens, who could be more accurately described as having fixed incomes.  Younger households can share in the wealth gains of the older generation through bequests but on the basis of current demographic tables only about 5.7% of corporate equity is bequeathed over a five year period compared to 24.4% over a fifteen year period.  During the past two year, households over the age of 65 have enjoyed an equity capital gain of about $250 billion compared to $125 billion for people in the age group 35-44 years and $196 billion for people in the age group 45-54 years.
Two months after Alan Greenspan became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987, the New York stock exchange experienced its largest one day correction since 1929 and the Dow fell by over 23%.  Since 1990, the New York market has enjoyed a seven year bull run without experiencing even the modest 5-10% corrections typical of past bull markets.  Mr. Greenspan's attempt to pursue a policy of monetary fine tuning rather than large and abrupt changes in the level of interest rates certainly has contributed to the market's good performance since 1990 but he has also enjoyed the benefits of a sustained period of global disinflation.  In the 1970's, by contrast, inflation shot up to double digit levels on two occasions because of oil price shocks, global crop failures, and the cost pass through pricing policies which characterized the U.S. corporate sector before the 1980's.

<P>

Not coincidentally, the global economic forces which have restrained inflation and boosted equity prices during recent years also have played a role in encouraging the economic anxieties about stagnant real wages and corporate restructuring which helped to produce victories for Patrick Buchanan in the early Republican primaries.  Many of the voters who have suffered from wage stagnation or job losses have not enjoyed compensating gains from rising equity prices despite the boom in mutual fund ownership.  At present, only 13% of U.S. workers belong to profit sharing plans and just 3% are enrolled in Employee Stock Ownership Plans.  There are even striking class divisions in the membership of 401-K plans.  About 46% of white collar workers belong to 401-K plans while only 26% of blue collar workers are enrolled in such plans.  The unequal sharing in the benefits of corporate rationalization and disinflation creates the risk of a political backlash against business and demands for more interventionist government policies to protect the interests of company stakeholders (employees, etc.), not just stockholders.  If the corporate sector wants to contain such political pressures, it should attempt to promote share ownership among the people who have not yet found their way into the equity market through mutual funds by promoting more widespread use of ESOP's.  In the past, trade unions opposed ESOP's and profit sharing but during the past decade some unions have turned to ESOP's in order to promote employee takeovers of troubled companies.  The major barriers to expanding ESOP membership in the 1990's have been the reluctance of workers to accept the double jeopardy of committing capital to the same firm where they work (they naturally prefer more diversification of risk), reduced tax benefits, and disagreements about how large a role workers should have in a company's management as their share of its equity expands.  More universal ownership of equity would not resolve all of the concerns about eroding real wages and job insecurity now plaguing America's labor force but it would at least help to contain the politics of envy now stirring in the U.S. presidential election campaign.  If envy emerges as a dominant theme in this year's election, the financial press will soon be carrying stories about the risks posed to the U.S. economy from household wealth losses in the stock market, not just stagnant real wages.
