<BODY>
We're planning a number of enhancements for your 1996 year-end
account statement to provide a more comprehensive overview of
the performance of your Kemper Funds investments.
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>If you have multiple accounts, the first part of your statement,
the portfolio summary, reports on your entire Kemper Funds portfolio.
 The summary will now include your initial investment amount*,
any subsequent purchases you've made, any amounts withdrawn and
the change in your account value as of December 31.  We'll also
include your investments' market value as of the beginning of
the statement period, allowing you to compare it to the current
market value.
<P>
<LI>Similar to the portfolio summary, for each of your accounts,
we will show your initial investment amount*, subsequent purchases
you've made, any amounts withdrawn and the change in your account
value as of December 31.
<P>
<LI>If you've held your account for two years or more, you'll
also receive a &quot;Personal Performance&quot; summary showing
the one-year total return on each of your accounts, as well as
their average annual total return since inception* and a graphic
illustration for each of your Kemper fund accounts.
<P>
<LI>The taxable income portion of your dividend summary will be
expanded to show ordinary income (which includes both your income
dividends and short-term capital gains) and long-term capital
gains.  
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>* For accounts established prior to December 31, 1989, the market value as of December 31, 1989, will be used in place of your initial investment amount and as a starting point for calculating your average annual total return.
<P>
For Kemper-Dreman accounts established after September 11, 1995, the market value as of September 11, 1995, will be used in place of your initial investment amount and as a starting point for calculating your average annual total return.
</FONT SIZE=1><P>
A detailed explanation of the enhanced year-end statement will
be in the next issue of <I>Kemper Fundamentals</I>.  You'll receive
it, along with your statement, in early January, 1997.
