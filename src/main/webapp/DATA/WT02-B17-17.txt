<b>Frank Lynch</b>
<p>
Franklin E. Lynch, president of Hydrogen Consultants, Inc. (HCI), has 
been

involved in alternative fuels development for 26 years.  He has been a 
"hands-on"

manager of HCI since 1978.  Since then, HCI has studied, developed, 
demonstrated,

and manufactured many hydrogen-based systems involving high-pressure 
gas,

cryogenics, and metal hydrides.
<p>
His involvement with hydrogen energy R&D goes back to 1970. Then an

undergraduate at UCLA, he led a team of students in the areas of metal 
hydride and

hydrogen-fueled engine development.  That work culminated in the team's 
award-

winning entry in the 1972 Urban Vehicle Design Competition.  From 1972 
to 1974, he

was vice president of Billings Energy Corp.
<p>
He has been a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers for 22 years,


serving as a national lecturer on hydrogen-powered mining vehicles and 
speaker on

hydrogen and hythane.  At present, he is vice chairman of the board of 
the National

Hydrogen Association.  As part of his activities as a member of the DOE 
Hydrogen

Technology Advisory Panel, Mr. Lynch has chaired a committee on surface 
vehicles. 

He also participates in the activities of the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District

Hydrogen Task Force and the International Standards Organization's 
Technical

Committee on Hydrogen.  He is a board member of Hydrogen 2000, a 
nonprofit

organization.  Mr. Lynch received his degree in engineering in 1971.
