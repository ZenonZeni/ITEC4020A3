<center><h3> The National Commercial Transportation of Horses to Slaughter Bill</h3></center>

<body>

<p><b>WHAT WAS PASSED?</b> - Authority was given to the USDA to  promulgate through "creating guidelines" for the transport of horses destined for  slaughter.  Provisions are however  "subject to the availability of appropriations".  And, no funds have been appropriated for the years 1996 or 1997. It will come up again for vote in 1998, but again, no appropriations, no enactment.  Final language was amended deleting the words "safe and humane" from the bill; regulation was replaced with mere guidelines; recommendations will be performance based (BAD) not engineering based;  and the final version took on industry studies. </p>

<p><b>BOTTOM LINE</b> - The horses did not get a thing.  They are still being transported in double decked cattle trucks with no water or rest without preloading veterinary inspections. </p>

<center><h3> VERY IMPORTANT</h3></center>


<p><b>AB3167 - By Assemblywoman Diane Martinez</b> - Amended to make it a crime to export out of this any pet or companion animal for the purpose of  slaughter and use as food. </p>


<p><b>STATUS:</b> On the Senate Floor on the Consent Calendar.  Expected to pass and onto the Governor's desk for signature. </p>

<p><b>ACTION:</b>   Please write:</p>
