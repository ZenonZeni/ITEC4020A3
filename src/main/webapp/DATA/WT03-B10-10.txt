EUROPEAN TV PRODUCTION TO GET FINANCIAL BOOST
More channels mean more content opportunities

     Increased channel capacity will lead to increased revenue
opportunities for European television production companies in 1996.
     "There are so many channels that you can't go on showing American
reruns forever," said Nicholas Littlewood, managing director of
London-based Communications Equity Associates International Ltd. 
"There is a thirst for new product, and we will see a number of new
television production finance companies coming into existence,
certainly in the U.K." 
     This does not necessarily mean the market will expand for
Hollywood-produced content.  Most European governments have been
trying to move away from Hollywood influences, opting to fund home-
grown projects instead:

     * Recently, the European Commission proposed a $265 million fund
for European film and television producers;
     * Proceeds from a U.K. lottery were used to encourage a domestic
film industry; and
     * The French government mandates that at least half of its
country's cable programming come from French producers.  French
producers make about 150 films each year.

     Indeed, the French government has been particularly hard on
American content.  For instance, it fought to keep Ted Turner's
Cartoon Network off the country's television screens before finally
relenting.
     This could open up a huge market for European film producers. 
While more channels are being created (and more distribution paths
such as cable and satellite), some European governments have vowed not
to fill the additional channels with programming from the United
States.
     "I don't see any radical changes," Littlewood said.  "So while
there is going to be more content in terms of channels, there are
still heavy restrictions on what is shown on specific French
channels."
     Other countries, however, appeared to have embraced American
programming.  Germany-based The Kersh Group admitted recently that it
was going to increase its American content dramatically.  Analysts
deemed this revelation a blow to the German television industry.

Consumer Wants

     While some European governments are looking to legislate
Hollywood out of their countries, consumers are sounding a different
note.
     "In terms of popularity, people by and large prefer American made
films," Littlewood said.  "They have a more universal appeal in Europe
than films coming from any one particular country within Europe."
     In France, for instance, U.S. films hold four of the top five
spots.  In Italy, U.S. films account for 75 percent of the market.
     Indeed, few European films have achieved international
popularity.  Recently, there have been some exceptions (the U.K.'s
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" and France's "Nikita" and "Cyrano" have
translated well to the United States) but the general rule of thumb is
that Hollywood films will play well in Europe.
     Some European producers see the trend changing.  With proper
funding, European films could compete with Hollywood.  And that
funding, as well as the unspoken Hollywood quotas, could lead to a
more competitive environment.

Convergence

     1996 could be the year of the takeover/merger in the United
Kingdom.  Many analysts predict consolidation in the cable industry
will continue.  Currently, the U.K. cable market is saturated, meaning
new alignments will be formed and companies will begin to sell off
their divisions.
     "The convergence between telephony and cable and interactive
services is undoubtedly happening," Littlewood said.
     The path is being smoothed somewhat by the British government,
which is considering legislation relaxing cross-ownership limits,
allowing more freedom for newspapers and broadcasters to be owned by
the same person.
     John Hall, managing director of U.S.-based John Hall & Co. Inc.
predicted cable finally will begin to make some inroads on the
satellite-dominated market.
     "European cable should do well this year in a market
traditionally dominated by the satellite companies," Hall said.

New Media

     The new 'new media' market will offer content providers a new
programming outlet, and everyone is looking for new areas of growth.
     Newspapers, such as The Financial Times, are expected to play
around with online services far more this year.  
     "There are a lot of exciting developments in interactive games,"
Littlewood said.  "Awareness of the Internet is surging."
     Hall agreed, predicting the Internet will hit a global market
this year.
     "There will be tremendous market opportunities for any company
that knows how to use the Internet," Hall said.   
     Interactive television, however, will not be much of a factor in
1996, analysts predicted.  The much-hyped technology still will be in
a testing phase for much of the year.
     "It hasn't taken off yet," Littlewood said.  "We are all waiting
to see what the results of that are."

COMPANIES TO WATCH IN 1996:

     * Pearson plc has transformed itself from a conglomerate into a
much more specific media company.  It has The Financial Times.  It is
looking very actively at new media.  It has reorganized a lot of its
old-fashioned publishing interests.
     * Reed Elsevier will be interesting.  It is moving into higher
margin businesses, discarding a lot of divisions, such as regional
newspapers and electronic book publishing.
     * Havas will be interesting.  The French economy is obviously
having a tough time at the moment, but I think they are in the process
of reorganization.

SEX SELLS: EUROPEAN MARKET READIES FOR ADULT-ORIENTED ONSLAUGHT
But don't look for X-rated material to stick around for long

     European consumers can expect an influx of adult-oriented
programming in the coming year if the development of the Internet
continues to follow current market trends.
     Indeed, many analysts are looking at X-rated movies and games as
the Infobahn's dirty little secret, saying they financially will drive
the digital highway's development to the tune of close to $1 billion.
     The international market for adult-oriented programming quickly
is filling up with companies looking for profits:

     * Playboy Entertainment increased its television presence from 17
countries three years ago to 130 territories today;
     * Graff Pay-Per-View Inc. adult programming is seen in Europe,
nine former Communist countries, parts of Africa, the Middle East,
Australia, Hong Kong and South America; and 
     * Graff's Home Video Channel boasted 200,000 U.K. subscribers at
the end of the second quarter.  Spice has about 20 million U.S.
households;
     * Penthouse formed a joint venture with Graff last fall to put
its content on European television, computer services and CD-ROMs.

     Analysts warn profits to be gained from adult-oriented material
are not necessarily limited to X-rated videos--even if they are one of
the most profitable pay-per-view applications has been adult movies.
     Adult-oriented games and gambling also are expected to make an
impact on the Infobahn's bottom line.  For instance, when the popular
Mortal Kombat II was released last year, it brought in $50 million in
the first week alone.

A Short Market

     Few industry observers, however, believe adult material will have
the drawing power to continue financing the digital highway.
     The same trends happened when the VCR was first released.  Adult
videos made up about 80 percent of the profits in the first year, but
they take in 10 percent now.
     "I don't think [X-rated movies] will be a major money maker in
the interactive business," said Jeff Bernstein, vice president of
programming for Request TV.
     While subscribers and revenues are up at many of the companies
peddling adult programs, so is the competition.  
     New adult satellite TV channels are launching in the United
Kingdom, across Europe and into the Far East.  Graff executives blame
Canada's more explicit adult services for the 8 percent drop in the
company's DTH satellite revenues.
     Adult programming has proved to be a risky venture for many
companies--such as U.K.-based Red Hot Television, which crashed and
burned in bankruptcy.  Even the genre's patriarch Playboy has had its
financial troubles over the years.
     "The true test will be in three years to see who's around and
thriving," Graff's Steve Saril told our sister publication
International Cable.

Graff's Financials

     The industry of sex is starting to be profitable for Graff, which
saw its second quarter 1995 consolidated revenues rise 6 percent to
$11.5 million.  The U.S.-based programmer owns the European-based Home
Video Channel, Erotica and The Adult Channel.  It also owns Spice,
Spice2 and Adam & Eve in the United States.
     For the first six months of 1995, revenues were up 15 percent to
$23.1 million.  Revenues for 1994 were $40.4 million, up 97 percent
over 1993.
     Graff executives point to Europe as their biggest growth area. 
The company entered the international market four years ago.  In that
time, it has had to learn to adapt to different foreign markets and
foreign regulatory regimes.
     To adapt, Graff tailors its programming to particular markets--
meaning it will show dressed (heavily edited) or undressed (unedited)
versions, said Christopher Yates, head of global expansion for Graff
programming.
     "We can tailor-make our service to a particular market," Yates
said.  "We have the largest library and we produce the most
programming.  We have all versions of all kinds of product.  We can
have four or five versions of a network if we need to."
     Playboy also offers different versions of its programming to
satisfy different markets, said Mary Herne, senior vice president,
international division for Playboy Entertainment Group.
     "Our programming works on both free TV and pay TV," Herne said.
     She noted a syndication deal was signed with Middle East TV
distributor Orbit to carry the non-nude version of Playboy's soap
opera "Eden."  It may be tame fare, comparatively, but it moves the
Playboy name and brand into the Middle East.
     In contrast, she said, there's Germany, "which has consistently
taken everything we've offered."
     Playboy produces about 22 feature-length movies and 26 half-hour
programs a year.

SIDEBAR

     The only countries that have been able to keep sex off TV have
been ones with either stringent conservative governments or a lack of
powerful satellite footprints.
     "There really isn't any sex on TV in China," said Randy Barbato,
director and producer of World of Wonder.
     In Africa, where Graff and Playboy are pushing to launch
channels, the sexiest show the directors found was a bathing suit
contest on broadcast TV.
     Middle East consumers circumvent their conservative government
with satellite dishes.
     A European trend in broadcast fare has been to put sex into game
shows.  Broadcast TV stations in Spain, Italy and Germany have prime
time shows that can be described as "Wheel of Fortune" with stripping.

BSKYB BEING INVESTIGATED

     The Office of Fair Trading in the UK is launching a wide-ranging
investigation into the programming supply arrangements of BSkyB
(British Sky Broadcasting), which could impact severely on the
satellite company's exclusive sports deals. The investigation will go
further than many in the industry expected and follows widespread
concern voice by a number of franchisees.  The Director General of
Fair Trading said the review "will be confined to the issues relating
to the supply in the United Kingdom of programming and related
services at wholesale level." The OFT is particularly concerned about
the length of BSkyB's sports contracts.  Exclusive sports contracts
have been a long-time feature of British terrestrial broadcasting, but
the OFT said that the market had changed over the last few years with
the growth of pay television.  The key deal in question is the five-
year agreement for soccer's Premier League, which includes a clause
enabling BSkyB to match rival broadcasters' bids for future rights.
The investigation will run in parallel with OFT's main six-month
review of the company's position in the pay-TV market.

NEW BIDDERS FOR PREMIER LEAGUE

     In the strongest indication yet that Nethold and DirecTV are to
challenge Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB in Europe, Channel 5's major
shareholders MAI and Pearson are understood to be planning a joint bid
with Nethold and Hughes Corp. (owner of digitally compressed DirecTV
package, which operates in the United States) for rights to the UK's
Premier League, which is coming toward the end of its joint contract
with BSkyB and the BBC.  Rumours that Nethold and DirecTV are to join
forces in Europe have recently been rife, with Nethold drawing in
experience staff from around Europe to its new television facility to
be based in the Netherlands.  BSkyB has already proved the vital role
football plays in driving up subscriptions and the purchase of
exclusive rights could prove to be the driving force in growing a
rival satellite package to challenge Murdoch.

KIRCH AND MMBG COME TOGETHER OVER MEDIABOX

     In a recent meeting at Deutsche Telekom office in Bonn, German
media magnate Leo Kirch finally agreed to cooperate fully with the
development of Mediabox, backed by MMBG's (Multimedia
Betreibergesellschaft), as a common standard for digital TV in Germany
and France, and ditching the development of its own unit D-Box.  The
decision has effectively managed to avert a standards war which could
have stalled the arrival of digital TV in Germany and seen Kirch-owned
pay movies channel Premiere's million or so subscribers equipped with
a totally incompatible system.  A spokesperson for the Kirch Group
commented, "It's in the best interests of customers if only one
decoder is needed."   MMBG will be restructuring its shareholding
following the arrival of Kirch, with the agreement possibly offering
some form of compensation to Kirch for costs incurred in developing
the D-Box.  MMBG's Mediabox looks set to become the standard in both
France and Germany and already has the backing of private cable
operator Veba, Deutsche Telekom, German state broadcasters ARD and
ZDF, French pay-TV broadcast Canal Plus, RTL, CLT and Bertelsmann.  So
far, a significant number of manufacturers have been signed up by the
MMBG, including Sony, Pioneer, Thomson, Philips and Sagem.  As we went
to press, the official accord was announced, with Veba said to be hold
to take a 25.1 percent state in MMBG.

OVUM ISSUES FINAL UPDATE ON ITV

     Ovum, the London-based market research company, has just issued
the fourth and final update to its report, "Interactive Television:
the Market Opportunity." The update contains a set of forecasts for
the interactive TV market to the year 2005. For the first time, the
forecasts include projections for key
countries in Asia-Pacifica--Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea,
New Zealand, and Singapore are covered.  John Matthews, principal
consultant with Ovum, said, "Interactive TV has been slow to take off,
but it offers significant opportunities in the medium and the long
term. According to Matthews the United States will be the first area
to become "cash positive" in interactive TV.  In 2002, Europe is
forecast to make a profit on capital monies
invested in the technology.  Ovum predicts that the Asia-Pacific
region will not become cash positive, even at 2005, the far range of
the report's coverage.
     Predictably, the United States will have about 26.4 million
households with cable access to interactive TV by the year 2005.  The
report also predicts that, by that year, revenues received by service
providers from advertising will be $780 million in the Asia-Pacific
region, $4.3 billion in Europe and $9 billion in the United States.

U.S. SOFTWARE COMPANIES LOOK TO GET LOCAL IN EUROPE
Developers invest in localizing their products

     U.S. software publishers are stepping up efforts to invade the
European market with foreign-language versions of their English-
language titles.
     The strategy in developing the international market sounds
simple: Developers need to read the markets they want to enter
properly.
     "Everything is a risk," said Hasbro Interactive Worldwide's Tom
Dusenberry.  "You have to hope you're betting on the right hardware
formats to go after.  You have to hope you're picking the right
product to make interactive.  That's something I lose sleep over."
     Developers looking to make money off of foreign-language versions
of their English-language titles need to determine which titles to
develop from the beginning of a production cycle.
     Developers also must account for how much memory various
characters or letters take up in different languages.  For example,
German takes up 50 percent more space than English.  Japanese also
requires a considerable amount of memory.
     Using this strategy, two companies, Interplay Productions Inc.
and Creative Wonders are hoping to increase revenues based on sales of
titles in Europe by 50 percent over the next year.

Peanuts In Europe

     Virgin Sound and Vision (VSV) also is channeling its enormous
financial resources into sought-after licensing deals and an
international launch strategy.
     "We're looking at products with  global appeal and global recoup
value, which allows us to put another hundred or hundred and fifty
thousand into the title," said Tom Turpin, VSV president and CEO.
     Virgin has inked deals with Softgold Gmbh in Germany and Hedarzi
in Israel to localize VSV title's for the developers' respective
markets.  The goal:  to create the same title in different languages
that reflects their respective idioms and nuances.
     "There's such a strong motivation (culturally) to get ahead in
those areas," Turpin said.
     Funded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, the content-focused
software company's first big title--Get Ready For School, Charlie
Brown--hit stores last fall and provides a window into the company's
philosophy.
     Sparing no expense, Virgin licensed characters from United
Features Syndicate and worked with Bill Melendez Studios, the firm
that created the animation for the Charlie Brown television specials,
to develop the title.

Big Bird in Europe

     Creative Wonders executives also are looking to popular
children's characters for profits, but they seem to have taken it a
step further.  Creative Wonders President Greg Bestick believes audio
elements have become a more important part of multimedia software, so
developers should secure authentic voices to reach discriminating
consumers.  
     The company dubbed in voices of local actresses and actors for
the characters in its line of Sesame Street titles.
     "We also focus on finding local voice content--new voices for the
different countries," Bestick said.
     One word of caution:  Keep the voice track separate from other
programming in a title.  "It's easier to localize if it's done that
way," Bestick said.

Interplay's Plans

     Localized products are more likely to sell if a publisher's
foreign release coincides with a domestic launch.  
     "Between 40 and 50 percent more products [sell] if the local
version comes out simultaneously with the U.S. release," Interplay's
Julie Roether said.
     If publishers release a U.S. version first, they risk losing out
on the sale of the foreign language version of a product.  
     If a German version of a product comes out much later than the
English version, it likely will have difficulty in the marketplace. 
Germans, who are very English literate, often will buy the first
version of a product even if it is in English.
     The biggest hurdle developers face in creating localized versions
of titles is making the commitment to do it.
     "The initial returns aren't there," said Bestick. "It's a leap of
faith."

PHILIPS PREPARES TO DEBUT DVD PLAYER IN ASIA
Company demonstrates prototype at MIP Asia

     As Philips Media prepares to distribute its high-density DVD
player in Asia, the media industry is standing up and taking notice.
     No other consumer electronics manufacturer has stated that it
will simultaneously deliver DVD as a peripheral for the PC and as an
accompaniment to the television.
     The company demonstrated for the first time its DVD player
prototype at  MIP Asia TV last week. Close to the new unified format
specifications, the two-hour video was in PAL on two widescreen TV
sets and was encoded in MPEG 2 in Eindhoven. It was stored on one
layer of a high density CD.
     While the quality of the picture can be improved, only members of
the Motion Pictures Experts Group could spot the flaws in the disc,
which showed the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral. Even so, the press
covering the event seemed impressed with the crispness of the picture
with the freeze-frame function.
     Market researchers predict 10 percent of consumers will but DVD
players by the year 2000.  
     Philips realizes the importance of backward compatibility of its
high- density player line in safeguarding the $120 trillion that
consumers worldwide have spent on CD-ROMs, said Peter Van der Poll,
general manager of Phillips Media Asia.
     Van der Poll stressed the interchangeability between applications
and played up the importance of the SD Alliance's acceptance of
Philips' modulation scheme last September.  When asked, Van der Poll
confirmed that with the purchase of an MPEG card, all Philips Video CD
products will work on a PC.
     Philips' officials declined to estimate the cost of the DVD
player, due to be launched in late 1997 or early 1998. 
     According to Van der Poll, Philips expects that the market for CD
drives will double in the next few years. The majority of the new
business will take the form of PC-based multimedia products.
     Philips set up its Asian operations in Hong Kong because the city
is the home of electronic publishing, film and music in the region. 
As in Europe, the company is promising local language products in
Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Malaysian, possibly Indonesian
and Tagalog.
     The company's hopes for the region are not limited to off-line
products.  Following the creation of United Philips Communications--
the joint venture with United International Holdings Ltd. that has
resulted in Europe's largest private cable multiple system operator--
Philips is weeks away from reaching agreements with three cable
operators in the region.
     The aim is to create more networks and develop three more cable
ventures over the next two years, said Van der Poll. 

Localizing Content

     As Philips tries to build up a CD catalogue, it will go to great
lengths to foster local content. "You need local content," Van der
Poll said.  "Up to 60 percent of our music business is based on local
content, local repertoire--we believe the same will be true for film,
for entertainment and definitely for education."
     The added benefit is that piracy will be reduced -- a problem
that in the past has been well documented in Asia, but which Van der
Poll said is slowly getting better. 
     Looking to the future, Van der Poll said that co-productions with
Beijing TV also are in the offing.  High-density CD-ROM will hit the
market by the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997.
     He would not venture to anticipate the price, but offered, "if
you want to be successful in a PC application, the price has to be,
after a year or so, the same as the standards we are with now.  It
will be of the same order of magnitude as the current CD." Rewriteable
CD is in the cards for 1998.

CZECH REPUBLIC

     The political and economic situation in Czech Republic has
stabilized.  No basic changes are expected in the political scene,
even after the Parliamentary elections in 1996.  Macro-economic signs
are very favorable, and it is widely presumed that Czech Republic has
gone through the difficult phase of transformation.
     The main reasons for foreign investment are the Czech Republic's
fast economic development and its stable political situation.  The
Czech consumer and the advertising market have almost reached the same
level as Western Europe.
     Nova TV, which began broadcasting Feb. 4, 1994, was the first
private national television channel in Central Europe.  The station
quickly had the biggest market share and the highest number of viewers
per day.
     State television reacted to the increasing ratings of Nova TV by
changing the programming, adapting the prices and becoming much more
flexible.
     There is only one private regional television station, Premiera,
which covers more than 50 percent of the Czech Republic.  It
concentrates on the economically strong areas--Prague and Central
Bohemia.

INTERACTIVE SERVICES CAUSE MILE-HIGH HEADACHES
1995 was the year of the bug; will 1996 be the year it hits big?

     A new, seemingly overlooked market is looming for film and
television producers looking to peddle their content: the airline
industry.
     Indeed, interactivity was the hottest buzzword in in-flight
entertainment in 1995, but the systems airlines hoped would give them
an edge over the competition were plagued with continued bugs and
delayed tests.
     Enthusiasm continues among major airlines, despite challenges.

     * Northwest was forced to shut down its test of an interactive
Hughes-Avicom international system last summer.  Even still, the
carrier began tests of a redesigned version of the Hughes system in
September.  
     * United Airlines abandoned interactive features on its GEC
Marconi-supplied IFE systems after problems surfaced on systems
installed onboard its new Boeing 777 aircraft.  
     * Tests of interactive IFE systems scheduled with British Airways
and American Airlines also were postponed because of technology
challenges.
     * Plus, In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) struggled with reliability
issues and scrambled to convince Continental, USAir and America West
not to cancel contracts.  IFPC began testing a new, debugged version
of its Flightlink IFE and communications system with Continental in
September.  

The Promise and the Glitches

     Even with the current problems, these advanced IFE systems hold
considerable promise.  
     * IFPC's Flightlink system, for example, is slated to begin live
multi-channel television and audio broadcasts via satellite by the
third quarter of 1997 and plans to have the capability to send faxes
to the ground from airline seats in the near future.
     * BE Aerospace, which has an IFE system boasts video-on-demand
capability, says it is hopeful its system (scheduled to be tested with
BA) will be ready for trials by March.  
     * Sony Trans Com teamed with Microsoft to develop a video-on-
demand product it hopes to be ready for customers by 1997.  
     * Matsushita Avionics Systems Corp., the vendor for the American
Airlines IFE program, hopes to have video-on-demand capability
available for that carrier's trial in the near future.
     * Cathay Pacific announced in August it would install two IFE
systems on its fleet, with plans to upgrade to interactive capability
by next year.         
     * In October, Alitalia went outside the pool of traditional
vendors to tap Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. (IFT) for a three-
month, 30-seat trial of its interactive video-on-demand system in its
recently revamped first class.  The system offers 22 video channels
with audio tracks in five languages. Videos played on the system are
completely under individual control and can be started, stopped, or
rewound by the passenger.
     If the trial meets with success, the carrier hopes to roll out
the system on seven more planes by mid-1996.
     "I still think there is a lot of smoke and mirrors out there,"
Dean Haehnel, president of the World Airline Entertainment Association
(WAEA), said about interactive IFE before the group's conference in
Amsterdam.  "There are a lot of companies demonstrating products that
have never flown, and there is still a lot of work to be done in the
area of interactive and video-on-demand. That is really the problem,
right now, the whole issue of reliability."

The Gambling Cure

     Another of the more promising---and unconventional---in-flight
innovations for carriers, vendors and passengers alike is in-flight
gambling.
     Finally, it seems, technology may have caught up with desire, as
Alitalia's IFE system premiered the capability for in-flight gambling,
though initially passengers will not play for money. 
     Also on the in-flight gambling front, Sky Games International
announced recently it had inked an agreement to provide its gambling
software for use with a major airline's in-flight entertainment
system. The software will be installed and ready for play as early as
next year.
     Sources say the contract was signed with Singapore Airlines, but
neither Sky Games nor the airline to date has confirmed this.
     Although in-flight gambling has raised a number of concerns,
industry studies suggest a single widebody jet equipped with
interactive IFE systems could generate up to $2 million a year -- half
of which would come from gambling.
