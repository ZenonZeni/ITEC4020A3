<i>Editor's Note:  From October 14 to October 20, Rhodes community members will have opportunities to learn about how alcohol impacts our culture.  A schedule of events is included at the end of this newsletter.  These programs are being held in conjunction with National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week.  We should all keep in mind, however, that alcohol awareness should be present every day...not just during this special week. -RAH</i>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's the situation:  A student begins drinking in his/her room prior to a party.  The student drinks a few beers, turns up the music and taps out the beat on a desk.  The student goes to the party where he/she has a few more beers.  He/she bumps into some people, spilling drinks and bumping one person's arm with a lit cigarette.  The student apologizes with a smile and moves to the dance floor.  After dancing a while, the student feels a little sick, goes to the bathroom, vomits, and goes back to the party for some more drinks. At the party he/she engages in some gossip conversation about a roommate.  The party gets a little dull, so the student decides to walk back to the residence hall, tearing some flyers off walls as he/she goes.  Once back at the dorm (it's now 1:30 a.m.) the student again cranks up some music, and wanders to the hall bathroom to clean up.  In the bathroom, he/she meets up with some friends and decides to leave with them to go get something to eat...forgetting the music is on in his/her room.  The student insists on driving to the restaurant, saying he/she is now sober again.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<li>What's wrong in the above hypothetical situation?  Can you find all of the secondary effects of this student's alcohol abuse?<p>
Many people shrug off drunken behavior thinking only the inebriated person is affected.  However, you only have to be around people abusing alcohol once to know that their behaviors impact many people.  Here are the secondary effects of the hypothetical situation:
<ul>
<li>Loud music affects those living around the person playing the music.
<li>"Tapping" a tune can be loud enough to disturb roomies and neighbors.
<li>Spilled drinks.
<li>Arm burned by lit cigarette.
<li>Vomit in the bathroom impacts all users until the mess is cleaned.
<li>Gossip/rumors damage relationships and reputations.
<li>Flyers improperly removed -- possible SRC violation.
<li>Once again, loud music.
<li>No way this student is sober yet...driving under the influence impacts all passengers in the car and all other drivers on the road.</ul><p>
Now do you think the student was the only one impacted by his/her behavior?
<p><p>
<center><H2>Alcohol/Drugs and Your Society</H2></center><p>
So maybe we are willing to admit that people living around us -- our friends, our families, our neighbors -- can be affected by our alcohol/drug misuse.  But it stops there, right?  I apologize to the people I've hurt and everything will be okay, right?<br>
<center>Think again....</center>
<ul>
<li>Male alcoholics take their own lives 11 times more frequently than other men.  Women alcoholics kill themselves 16 times more often than women who are not alcoholics. <i>Suicide is very costly to those who love you...emotionally, financially, and spiritually.</i>
<li>Drug users consume three times the medical benefits and are five times as likely to file workers compensation claims than their nonaddicted counterparts. <i>Think about this the next time you pay a medical bill or an insurance premium.</i>
<li>The cost of alcohol related car accidents, fires, and health care has been estimated at $136.3 billion for 1990 and is predicted to grow to $150 billion in 1995. <i>That's a lot of tuition money!  Not to mention valuable time spent by the people dealing with the accidents, fires, and health care...time that might have otherwise gone to serve you.</i>
<li>Drug abuse accounts for $46.9 billion a year in direct and indirect costs to business and economy. <i>Once again, a lot of tuition and pizza money...wasted!  Not to mention your time spent calling back for customer service when a rep is out due to drug abuse.</i>
<li>Over 7% of all 1991 college freshmen (120,000) in the U.S. became drop-outs for alcohol-related reasons.  They will lose $33 in lifetime earnings. <i>Meaning you can't pay your rent, utilities, charge bills, etc....</i>
<li>If you have a blood alcohol level (BAL) of 0.08 (about 2 drinks for a 150 pound person), your relative risk of being involved in a fatal automobile accident is 3 times greater than that of a sober person.  You risk is about 15 times as great with a BAL of 0.12 (about 3 to 4 drinks for a 150 pound person). <i>Traffic accidents affect everyone through insurance rates, loss of loved ones, etc.</i>
<li>The use of alcohol/drugs is a factor present in many sexual assaults that occur in college-aged populations. <i>Jail time, court costs, emotional turmoil, AIDS, STDs..need we say more?</i>
<li>The use of alcohol/drugs is a factor present in numerous arguments, physical fights, batterings, child abuse, and more. <i>Family turmoil, lost relationships, bad reputations, criminal acts....and so on.</i><p></ul>

<center><H2>Cultures' Differing Alcohol Attitudes</H2></center>
<p>
Looking around campus on a Friday night around 11 p.m., one might think that the only cool thing to do is to be off-campus drinking.  That's interesting, because many cultures do not place such an emphasis on alcohol and other drug use.
<li>In Italy, wine is served with food and is given, watered down, to children at family meals.  
<li>In most Mormon, Adventist, and Muslim households in the U.S., alcohol is not served because it is prohibited by their religions.
<li>Nahuatl Indians drink only in prescribed social contexts and drunkenness is largely confined to community of family fiestas.  In this community, displays of aggression or hostility toward a fellow drinker are not tolerated.
<li>The Chinese regard drinking as immoral, but do not feel very strongly about it.  There is no real moral code against moderate drinking, little concern with drinking or alcoholism as a problem, and little guilt or hostility attendant upon drinking, provided the rules and procedures are followed.
<li>In Buganda, Abekinywi always drink together and share mwenge whenever they have it.  If one partner is not present a special gourd is set aside in the event he might actually arrive and/or to imply he is there in spirit.
<li>Food for thought:  How has the American culture changed in respect to alcohol use over the past 40 years?
