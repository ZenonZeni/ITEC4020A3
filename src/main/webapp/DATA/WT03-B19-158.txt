<FONT SIZE="+2">
<B>Country Victoria - Australia's most fertile and compact location - is
one of the world's best investment opportunities. It has enormous
energy reserves, natural advantages and excellent transport facilities
that link it closely to Melbourne, Australia's manufacturing centre.
The water and power infrastructure, world-class telecommunications
and proximity to markets have helped spawn a dynamic mix of industries.
Country
Victoria boasts strengths in agriculture, fishing, forestry and
mining, the full range of manufacturing industries, university
education, tourism and a diverse range of service industries.

<H2>How to use this guide</H2>
This guide offers practical advice
to potential investors on critical issues - investment opportunities,
the economic strengths of each region within country Victoria,
support for business, the available infrastructure and the outstanding
quality of life in country Victoria.
Five sections 
paint a comprehensive picture of Victorian industry; its
strengths and opportunities, its people and resources.
Each section
concentrates on a different region and the districts within it,
the distinctive features of their economies and the investment
opportunities they offer.
For information on a particular industry,
you should simply consult the industry index at the end of
each section. 
The index demonstrates the depth and complexity of country Victoria's
existing industry.
<H3>Country Victoria: the Business Environment</H3> 
Because Australia
is located in the Asia Pacific, Australian businesses have experience
working across both western and eastern business cultures. As
one of the world's oldest democracies, Australia enjoys economic
and political stability. The country has an excellent telecommunications
system, at more competitive rates than in most other countries
of the Asia Pacific. Moreover, Australia occupies the same time
zone as East Asia.Victoria is well located in relation to Australian
markets and suppliers. As the most densely populated state, Victoria
is at the centre of a notional triangle that accounts for 70 per
cent of Australia's population. With only 2.9 per cent of the
land mass, Victoria is Australia's smallest mainland state, yet
it accounts for roughly 25 per cent of Australia's 17.7 million
people.
<H2>Country Victoria's competitive advantages</H2>
An independent study by KPMG rated Victoria cost competitive
in: 
<UL>
<LI>industrial land;
<LI>senior management labour costs;
<LI>air and sea freight;
<LI>telecommunications;
<LI>high voltage electricity; and
<LI>gas.
</UL>
<P>
For example, senior management costs are 25 per cent more
expensive in Singapore than in Victoria, and 10 per cent more
expensive in Los Angeles. International telecommunications are
80 per cent higher in Singapore, 15 per cent higher in Los Angeles
and more than 100 per cent higher in Bangkok than the prices charged
in Victoria. The data indicates that regional Victoria is an ideal
place for industry to achieve and maintain world cost competitiveness.
<P>
Victoria has a dedicated, well trained workforce and a supportive
business environment. Melbourne, Australia's pre-eminent port
and the busiest port in the Southern Hemisphere, is easily accessible
to regional Victoria. Geelong and Portland, both in the west of
the state, offer excellent port facilities, and it is anticipated
that by 1998 a private sector funded general cargo berth will
operate at Hastings, Victoria's deepest port. Most of country
Victoria has excellent access to international air freight and
passenger facilities at Melbourne's Tullamarine, Australia's only
24-hour airport.
<P>
The major cities of Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra are well
within reach of all regional centres in country Victoria. The
state is also conveniently located for trading with all of the
industrial centres and markets of Australia, New Zealand and the
Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest growing region.
<P>
Victoria's road network is the best in the country and is
continually being upgraded. In recent years, Victorian roads have
become the world's safest. In much of the state, rail freight
is a viable option for transporting bulk products within Victoria
and interstate. Victoria's location at the hub of the new standard
gauge national rail network gives the state another advantage.
<P>
Victoria's energy resources are outstanding. The reserves
of natural gas are estimated to be sufficient for at least forty
years at current consumption rates. The supply network of Bass
Strait natural gas to country Victoria is already extensive and
was recently extended to regional centres in south-west Victoria.
<P>
Reserves of brown coal are estimated at 200,000 million tonnes,
sufficient for hundreds of years at current consumption rates.
Most of this coal has a low ash content, making it suitable for
the chemical industry and power generation. The coal has a low
sulphur content, and emissions are controlled.
<P>
Eighty per cent of Victoria's electricity is produced by brown-coal-fired
power stations on the coal fields. The balance is generated by
hydro and natural gas-fired plants. Large scale industry (around
10 mega watts), can have its electricity supplied at well below industrial
prices effective elsewhere. For example, electricity prices in
country Victoria are less than half those of Los Angeles and Singapore,
and nearly three times cheaper than Bangkok's prices.
<P>
Victoria's oil fields help make Australia largely self sufficient
in oil. Geothermal power is becoming an important energy source
along the west coast and in Gippsland, and solar energy is widely
used in the north.
<P>
In virtually all regional centres of country Victoria, suitably
located and zoned industrial land is available, at some of the
most competitive prices in the Asia Pacific. Regions will cooperate
with potential investors to develop fully serviced industrial
land for specific purpose industrial development, if current provision
is not entirely suitable.
<P>
Victoria's river and water storage systems offer reliable
water supplies to all the regional centres, and agriculture is
supplied with water by elaborate irrigation systems in the drier
areas. Some regions, such as Colac, have abundant supplies of
high quality water, and Victoria is well supplied by Australian
standards.
<P>
Country communities are very supportive of locally-based industries,
and the workforce of country Victoria is well known for reliability
and dedication. Training and industrial reforms have increased
the productivity, flexibility and skills of the workforce.
<H2>Industries prosper in country Victoria</H2>
<P>
Food processing and forestry products are the mainstays of manufacturing
in country Victoria.  Strengths in dairy processing (82 per cent
of Australian production) and in processed fruit and vegetables
(52 per cent of Australian production) have contributed to a heavy
concentration of the packaging industry in the state.
<P>
Major dairy manufacturers such as Snow Brand, Nestle, Kraft, Bonlac
and Murray Goulburn are expanding production for Japan and other
export markets.  Similarly, fishing operations are exporting speciality
fin-fish, abalone, eels and yabbies to Europe and Asia.
<P>
Thriving wine markets, particularly in Holland, Britain and Scandinavia,
create prospects for enormous growth of the wine industry.  The
establishment of the French wine maker, Domaine Chandon, in the
Yarra Valley demonstrates international interest in Victoria's
wine.
<P>
Increasingly, firms are investing across country Victoria in order
to manufacture non-food products.  The manufacturers locating
within country Victoria generally have an export focus, they apply
sophisticated technology and they employ the skills, flexibility
and enthusiasm of their employees.  Aircraft, aluminium smelting,
wool processing, cement, petrochemicals and computer hardware
are examples of the diverse products being manufactured in country
Victoria.
<P>
Avalon, near Geelong, is rapidly developing as a centre for the
aviation and aerospace industries.  Victoria is ideally placed
to capture demand from the Asia-Pacific region for product, systems
and services related to the aerospace industry and the emerging
markets for specialist products such as the GA200 agricultural
aircraft, which is built in Gippsland.
<P>
Australia's automotive industry has a strong presence in Geelong,
Ballarat and Bendigo, and specialist automobile components are
manufactured in other country centres.
<P>
Gold provided the impetus for Victoria's growth in the mid-nineteenth
century, and minerals continue to be important to today's economy.
 Coal, copper, limestone, mineral sands, clay, granite, slate,
diatomite and bentonite are mined and quarried throughout the
state.
<P>
Country Victoria offers excellent opportunities for processing,
particularly in dairy, quality meat products (beef, sheep, pork
and poultry) fruit and vegetables, wine, cereal products and confectionery.
<H2>Non-traditional industries taking off</H2>
<P>
In addition to traditional foods, new prima products such as green
tea, native flowers, bison, emu and ostrich, sheep milk, deer,
game, mulberry silk, krill and shell fish, speciality hardwoods,
llama, berries, peppermint and spearmint offer great potential
for new industries.
<P>
Downstream processing of the Wimmera's vast mineral sands is considered
practically and economically feasible, and processing of kaolin
deposits in the Ballarat district could be expanded.  Vast deposits
of china and ball clays offer the opportunity for development
of the ceramics porcelain tableware industry.
<P>
Central Victoria's high grade silicon-based quartz and gold also
present investment opportunities, as do magnesium reserves for
diecasting and alloying.
<P>
Victoria's beauty and variety are major tourism strengths and
offer investment opportunities in service industries. Tourism
Victoria's research shows that a large proportion of Australians
intend to visit Victoria's snow fields, Sovereign Hill, the Phillip
Island fairy penguins, the Twelve Apostles and other attractions.
International tourism is expected to grow due to forthcoming major
events such as the Melbourne Grand Prix and the Sydney Olympics.
<H2>Outstanding quality of life </H2>
<P>
Country Victoria offers its citizens an excellent quality of life.
Generally, country Victoria enjoys a pleasant Mediterranean climate
conducive to outdoor activities. Each region experiences four
distinct seasons, and only the duration of each differs from one
region to the next. Mildura and Swan Hill on the Murray River
in the State's north, for example, enjoy more annual sunshine
than Surfers Paradise in Queensland!
<P>
Recreational facilities include outstanding golf courses, gold
heritage areas and superb natural environments that are ideal
for horse riding and bush walking. Every town in country Victoria
has tennis courts, picnic grounds and swimming pools. Water sports
are a speciality of many regions, and winter activities include
snow sports and Australian Rules football.
<P>
Many regional centres have notable art galleries and performing
arts centres. If required, the magnificent cultural, sporting,
educational and other facilities of Melbourne, judged the world's
most liveable city by the Washington-based Population Crisis Committee,
are nearby and
easily accessible.
<P>
Good quality housing is available at low cost in all country regions,
and country people throughout Victoria are seeking investment
in their communities. They will welcome you, your family and your
investment.
<H2>Practical Government assistance</H2>
<P>
The Victorian Government's <EM>Investing in Country Victoria</EM> program
provides practical Government support. The program offers:
<UL>
<LI>Grants and facilitation assistance to investors locating or
expanding in country Victoria;
<LI>Support for local development organisations to promote and
assist development opportunities within their regions; and
<LI>Business advice for regional firms.
</UL>
<P>
The Victorian Government is committed to cooperating with local
communities, regional bodies and investors to identify energy,
water, transport and other requirements, and to matching investment
proposals to regions with appropriate infrastructure.
<P>
Business Victoria offers a 'one-stop' facilitation
service for investment projects that build on the advantages of
country Victoria.
