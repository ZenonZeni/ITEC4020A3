<H3>Assesslng and Promoting the Intangible Personal Qualities Relating
to Social Adjustment and Quality of Life </H3>

<P><B>Luanne Adams Knight, Ph.D.</B>, The Lab School, Washington, DC </P>

<P>“What can we do to help this child grow up to be a happy, well-adjusted
person who has friends, feels successful and enjoys life?” This question
is of primary concern to parents and educators raising children with learning
disabilities. The focus here is those seemingly “intangible qualities”
such as motivation, persistence, optimism, empathy, social skills, frustration,
tolerance, and problem solving; qualities that fall under the broad heading
of “personality”. This session will focus on how these qualities can be
defined and assessed in order to guide intervention, with illustrative
material from a multidisciplinary project directed toward promoting development
of these qualities in elementary school students with severe social disabilities.
