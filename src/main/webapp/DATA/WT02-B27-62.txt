There are three identifiable instructional structures most often employed in classrooms: individualistic, competitive, and cooperative. Each one is defined by the behaviors of students and teachers, and by the instructional objectives. In the cooperative structure, students work collectively to achieve a common goal. Situations are contrived that enable students to rely on one another to accomplish a goal. The teacher's role in cooperative learning is multidimensional. Thus, this section will specifically deal with several aspects of cooperative learning (see below) as it relates to <A HREF="../Teach">effective teaching</A>. In other words, the different sections will discuss how cooperative learning can effectively be incorporated in our classes, and how can students get the most out of this experience. The literature review and previous research has shown the <A HREF="CoopAdvan">benefits</A> that implementing cooperative learning can offer. Through working together to learn complex conceptual information and master knowledge and skills, students' achievement is increased creating positive relationships among the students, students have more fun, and develop many other skills, such as learning how to work with one another.<BR>
