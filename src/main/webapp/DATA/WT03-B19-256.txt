<i>Electricity</i>
<P>
Victoria's system is based upon the vast brown coal resources in the Latrobe Valley, about 150 kilometres east of Melbourne. These proven reserves can provide for the States electricity needs into the next century and beyond.
<p>
International comparison indicates that Victoria has a well established record as a supplier of low priced electricity.
<p>
Efficient and secure supply will be even further enhanced by a planned national electricity grid that will connect Victoria and other States.
<p>
<i>Victoria's electricity price structure</i>
<P>
Victoria's electricity supply industry has undergone significant restructure to ensure that its international competitiveness will be further strengthened. The entry of private sector companies has increased competition in the industry leading to lower prices to consumers.
<p>
The State continues to offer the lowest electricity prices to industry and commerce in Australia.
<p>
According to the annual survey of Australian electricity prices by energy analysts, NUS International, Melbourne consumers pay 5.74 cents per Kilowatt hour, well below the second lowest price of 6.69 cents per kWh in Adelaide.
<p>
NUS bases its survey on a customer model with a 1,000 kW demand using 450,000 kWh in a 12 month period to April 1995.

<i>Natural gas</i>
<br>
Victoria is well endowed with natural gas from offshore reserves in Bass 
Strait. The gas is reticulated throughout the State by the Gas and Fuel 
Corporation of Victoria. Prices for individual users vary according to a 
number of factors including the usage pattern and seasonality. The table below 
shows that, internationally, Victoria continues to be a very competitive 
supplier of natural gas for industrial consumers.

<i>Source: Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria</i><p>
 Tariff 21 applies to small to medium users (consuming approximately 420 GJ per annum).  Tariff 22 typically covers medium to larger users (consuming in the order of 6,840 GJ per annum).
<p>
<i>Large industrial and commercial users</i>
<p>
A competitive contract tariff is available to customers who consume more than 10 ,550 GJ of gas per year. The minimum bill is determined separately for each customer on the basis of annual load and load factors. At present, an industrial or commercial contract customer in Victoria with a steady load profile can expect to pay under $A3.50 per GJ for natural gas.
<p>
The Gas and Fuel Corporation operates the Energy Management Centre, which provides advice to customers on energy use in industry and commerce. Services include energy audits, process analyses, tariff analyses, energy management systems, co-generation, new plant energy systems, alternative energy options and energy management training courses.
<p>
<i>Water and sewerage</i>
<p>
Prior to 31 December 1994, Melbourne Water provided and billed customers for water, sewerage, drainage and parks services.  
<p>
On 1 January 1995, three government-owned regionally-based companies were given responsibility for providing water and sewerage service to customers.
<p>
Responsibility for metropolitan parks was transferred to a new statutory authority -Melbourne Parks and Waterways.
<p>
Melbourne Water continues as a statutory authority with responsibility for:
<UL>
<LI>Water catchments, storage and bulk supply of water to the three retail companies;
<LI>Acceptance of sewerage from the retailers, its treatment and disposal of effluent; and
<LI>Main drainage, waterways and flood prevention.
</UL>
Each of the three retail companies bills its customers for the four charges (water, sewerage, drainage and parks). The moneys collected for drainage and parks are remitted to the two authorities responsible for these services.
<p>
The water and sewerage charges shown below are fixed until 1 January 1997.
<p>
<i>Water, sewerage, drainage and planning charges</i>
<p>
Based on the Net Annual Value (NAV) of property as determined by the local municipal authority:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Non-domestic water consumption: Charge is 65 cents per 1,000 litres per annum, less the amount paid in annual rates, equivalent to 2.585 cents in $ of NAV, with a minimum of $102.50.
<LI>Sewerage: 4.216 cents in $ of NAV. Minimum charge $146.40.
<LI>Drainage: 0.615 cents in $ of NAV. Minimum charge $44.00.
<LI>Parks: 0.258 cents in $ of NAV. Minimum charge $41.00.
</UL>
<i>Trade waste</i>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Category 1: If Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and/or suspended solids (SS) discharges are less than 1,000 kilolitres per annum, and the BOD and SS concentration is less than 600 mg/l, the charge is a flat rate of $353.00 per year.
<LI>Category 2: If BOD and SS concentration is less than 600 mg/L and discharge is greater than 1,000 kilolitres per annum, the charge is 48.50 cents per 1,000 litres discharge.
<LI>Category 3: If BOD and SS concentration is greater than 600 mg/L, the charge is 29.3 cents per kilolitre discharge plus 31.3 cents per kilogram of BOD and/or 15.4 cents per kilogram of SS.
</UL>
Charges also apply for colour of the waste, oxidised sulphur content and nitrogen content. These are in addition to category charges.
