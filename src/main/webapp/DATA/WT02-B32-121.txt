<font size=+2>Low GIC Rates...What's An Investor To Do?</font><p>

</center>

<blockquote>

As RRSP season quickly approaches, many are wondering what to do with this years contribution with GIC rates at the lowest point in several decades. Others have GIC's coming due shortly and don't want to simply roll them over at these low rates. What to do...what to do? There are excellent alternatives to low rate GIC's, but which one is for you?<p>

If you took a poll of everyone who every purchased a GIC and asked them the purpose for which they invested that money you could divide their responses into two categories. Those who bought them to save for longer-term goals such as retirement and those who bought them to produce immediate income.<p>

First, if you're setting this money aside for the long term (5 years or more) GIC's have not historically been the best place to put your money. Far from it. If you invested $1,000 each year for the last ten years in 5 year GIC's (and reinvested the money in new 5 year GIC's as they matured) you would have averaged approximately 8.60% (as at the end of November 1996). Remember also that we had double digit rates in the late 80's (a far cry from today's low single digit rates). If instead you invested that same $1,000 each year in the TSE 300 Index you would have averaged 12.47%. Yes, the TSE had it's ups and downs over that time, but remember you're investing for the long term. The point is, choose a well balanced portfolio of investments that match your ultimate objective. Stay focused on that objective and don't allow yourself to be distracted! You can build a moderately conservative portfolio and still achieve significantly higher returns than GIC's can offer.<p>

If instead you invested in GIC's to provide you with an income (perhaps your retired) you have several options. Ultimately, we are concerned with how much money we have in our pocket to spend. There are two factors which affect this. One is our nominal rate of return and the other is how much of this return the tax man graciously allows us to share with him. One option is to consider dividend mutual funds. These invest predominately in shares of large blue chip companies, such as the banks, that have a solid record for paying dividends. The advantage of dividend income over the interest income that GIC's earn is that you pay far less tax. Below is a table that illustrates the marginal rate of tax paid on different types of income by an Ontario residents.

Another option to consider is investing in a growth oriented portfolio and then set up a systematic withdrawal plan to provide you with the money you need. Such a portfolio would consist significantly of growth equity mutual funds and balanced funds. Although these types of investments would produce primarily capital gains on which the marginal tax rate is slightly higher than on dividends (but still far below that on interest) you can expect that over time your rate of return will be significantly higher than on a dividend fund thus more than compensating you for the slightly higher amount of tax. This approach is most suited to those situations where the income will need to continue for quite some time (e.g. you've retired early and are in good health) because it offers you the best protection against inflation. Trimark Mutual Funds has illustrated this approach using their Canadian Fund. They assumed you invested $100,000 on Sept. 1, 1981 and withdrew $825 each month to Sept. 30, 1996. Over that time you would have withdrawn a total of $148,500 and your remaining investment in the Trimark Canadian Fund would still be worth over $233,000.<p>

The preceding has touched on several alternatives to low rate GIC's. Speak with your financial advisor to discuss which approach best meets your individual needs.
