After six months in detention without charge, Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of Nigeria's independent <CITE>Tell</CITE>&nbsp;magazine, was set free on June 24. <P>

But his release has not brought him relief, Igiebor told colleagues, because he is still at risk of rearrest. The day he was freed, he said, a director of the State Security Service (SSS) advised him that "adversary journalism" helps no one. And, when he got out of prison, he found that his phone lines at home and at work were cut.<P>

In a letter to CPJ, Igiebor, a 1993 recipient of the Committee's International Press Freedom Award, wrote that his release "would not have been possible without the relentless international press battle waged on my behalf by the Committee to Protect Journalists."<P>

Igiebor's release coincided with talks in London between Nigeria and the 56-member Commonwealth. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth following the November 1995 execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight fellow activists for the Ogoni people. <P>

Awalu Yadudu, the legal adviser to Nigeria's military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said that Igiebor's release was granted in deference to the United Nations. A U.N. mission went to Nigeria in April, and, at CPJ's urging, met with Igiebor in prison and with Nigerian authorities to discuss government attacks on the press. The mission's report condemned Decree 2, under which Igiebor was detained. The decree allows for detention without trial for "acts prejudicial to state security." <P>

<H3>Russian journalist released from prison in Samara</H3>


In what was believed to be a face-saving gesture by authorities, Valery Yerofeyev, a Russian journalist in Samara who was on trial for allegedly "pandering," was released from prison on July 29. Pressure from CPJ and other press freedom organizations are credited with securing   his release.<P>

Yerofeyev, editor of the weekly <CITE>Vremya-Iks</CITE>, was arrested on Sept. 25, 1995,  after publishing a series of critical articles entitled "People on the Sidewalks" about prostitution and police corruption. Although the prosecutor asked for the maximum sentence of five years in labor camp, Yerofeyev was sentenced to 10 months in prison, exactly the term he had already served in pre-trial detention.<br><p> -- By Catherine Fitzpatrick<P>

<H3>Independent Guatemalan editor target of grenade attack</H3>


Guatemala's J&oacute;se Rub&eacute;n Zamora Marroquin, former editor in chief of the independent daily <CITE>Siglo Veintiuno</CITE> and a recipient of CPJ's 1995 International Press Freedom Award, was dining at a Guatemala City restaurant on May 15 when three unidentified assailants in a moving vehicle threw two grenades at his car, which was parked out front. One exploded, damaging the car. The assailants escaped. <P>

Two days prior to the attack, Zamora had resigned as editor in chief of Siglo Veintiuno over conflicts with the board of directors. Zamora told CPJ that he believes the attack was intended to deter him from launching another newspaper in Guatemala. He also believes that the attack was a warning to his yet-to-be-named successor at<CITE> Siglo Veintiuno.</CITE><br><p>--By Mira Gajevic<P>                <P>

<H3>'Press Assassination Law' repealed in Egypt</H3>


After a yearlong struggle, Egyptian journalists have successfully fended off government efforts to radically curtail press freedoms. On June 17, the People's Assembly of Egypt approved new press legislation that repealed the notorious Law 93 of 1995.<P>

Law 93, dubbed the "Press Assassination Law" by journalists, assigned stiff prison sentences and heavy fines to offenses such as libel and abolished a previous law proscribing the preventive arrest or administrative detention of journalists under investigation for their work.<P>

Faced with vehement opposition from press freedom supporters, including many journalists writing for official papers, the government agreed to form a committee to draft a new press law. Despite official promises to the contrary, however, Law 93 remained in effect as the committee of 34--which included only four opposition journalists--slowly worked on a new draft. As a result, at least 20 journalists were tried or prosecuted under the draconian measure, and dozens more were placed under investigation.<P>

The government's "compromise" bill, passed by the upper house of parliament on June 9, reduced some of the punishments mandated by Law 93, but maintained the prolonged prison sentences and heavy fines  for crimes of publication. It also included articles that prohibit publishing news that "abuses public officials," "insults the parliament, the army, courts, authorities, or public agencies," "vilifies foreign heads of state," "insults the president of the republic," or "damages the nation's reputation."<P>

Journalists responded with a sit-in at Egypt's Press Syndicate and threatened a strike, prompting the personal intervention of President Hosni Mubarak. The government then introduced new legislation in the lower house of parliament that revoked Law 93, thereby restoring press freedoms in Egypt to the status quo of just over a year ago--a situation that is far from ideal. Yet the repeal must be considered a victory for Egyptian journalists, who showed remarkable solidarity and persistence in fighting the Law 93 restrictions.<br><p>-- By Avner Gidron<P>  <P>

<H3>Censorship looms in Hong Kong: China to prohibit journalists from 'advocating action'</H3>

In a May 31 interview on CNN, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China's State Council, said that Hong Kong's media would not be allowed to advocate independence for Taiwan or for Hong Kong after China assumes sovereignty over the colony in July 1997.<P>

In a speech at Japan's National Press Club on June 5, Lu said press freedom would be guaranteed after the handover. But he drew a distinction between reporting news and advocating action, saying that "advocating itself is not press freedom and is different from objective reporting."<P>

Lu's remarks generated widespread alarm in the Hong Kong press, with many journalists questioning China's commitment to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which contains a guarantee of press freedom. The document was negotiated by China and Great Britain for governance of Hong Kong after the handover.<P>

China's Information Minister, Zheng Jianhui, echoed Lu in a July 11 interview with the <CITE>Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE> and suggested that Hong Kong journalists follow the example of their mainland counterparts: "If [Taiwanese President] Lee Teng-hui stands up and says something, you can report it--just like we do. As long as someone else says it, that's okay."<br><p> -- By James Bucknell<P><P>
