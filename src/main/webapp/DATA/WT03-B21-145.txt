<P><CENTER><B>KASSANDRA MINES UPDATE</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, December 2, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to provide an update on the current status of its drilling campaigns being conducted by its wholly-owned Greek subsidiary, TVX Hellas, at its three existing mines at the Kassandra mines project in Greece and, to announce the initial results of the exploration program at the Skouries copper-gold porphyry deposit, which is part of the Kassandra mines concessions.  

<P>At the Madem Lakkos mine, which is currently being mined and provides mill feed to the Stratoni mill, a total of 12,102 metres of drilling has been completed to date with assays averaging 8.2% Pb, 13% Zn and 120 g/t Ag.  At the Mavres Petres mine, also located near the Stratoni mill, 3,146 metres of drilling have been completed with results to date averaging 7.4% Pb, 9.5% Zn, 213 g/t Ag and 5.1 g/t Au.

<P>At the Olympias mine, all work is continuing normally including ore definition drilling being conducted both underground and from surface.  The main purpose of this drilling is to provide a complete understanding of the nature of the existing Olympias orebody to assist in preparing the optimal future mine plan.  This information is the basis for the finalization of the design of the process recovery flowsheet to recover lead, zinc, silver and gold from the Olympias ore.  At Olympias, 166 drill holes totaling 3,235 metres of infill drilling at the main western orebody have been completed.  The assay results to date are confirming average grades of 5.5% Pb, 7.7% Zn and 10.4 g/t Au.  At the eastern part of the Olympias orebody, approximately 952 metres of drilling has been completed, however, only one assay result is available to date which showed similar base metal and gold values.

<P>TVX Hellas commenced drilling of the Skouries deposit in August 1996.  It is located within the southwestern portion of the Kassandra Mines claims, approximately 10 kilometres from the Aegean coast, in a sparsely populated area.  The exploration program was designed to reassess previous information regarding the deposit and to get a better understanding of the full extent of the mineralization.  Detailed exploration work was conducted in the 1960's by Nippon Mining and Placer Development Ltd. and in the mid-1970's by the previous Kassandra mines owners.  The information resulting from this previous work formed part of the Kassandra assets.  This work included 16,000 metres of drilling and 600 metres of drifting and was concentrated on the central part of the deposit.  Initial assessment demonstrated that the deposit extended to a depth of approximately 400 metres.  However, a few deeper holes showed interesting potential at greater depth.  

<P>The current drilling program extends to greater depth than previously explored, going to 1,000 metres in depth, as well as testing lateral extensions.  

<P>TVX Hellas expects to complete approximately 22 drill holes, totaling 15,000 metres of drilling by mid-December 1996.  As of December 1, approximately 90% of the drilling has been completed, while assay results are currently available on the first seven drill holes and parts of the subsequent two.  

<P>Initial Skouries results are contained in the attached table.

<P>The average grade of all assays is 0.64% Cu and 1.17 g/t Au.  Excluding approximately 15% of the samples by cutting at < 0.25% Cu and 0.25 g/t Au, the grades increased to 0.75% Cu and 1.36 g/t Au.

<P>Results to date reconfirm Skouries as a classic pipe shaped copper-gold porphyry.  Drilling shows exceptionally continuous ore grade mineralization over 800 metres in central parts of the pipe; while laterally to the pipe mineralization in schist wallrocks increases from surface to depth from 80,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> to 200,000 m<SUP>2</SUP>.

<P>It appears that the deposit consists of two higher grade zones: a near surface zone of approximately 0.8% Cu and 1.5 g/t Au and a high grade core zone at depth of approximately 1.1% Cu and 2.2 g/t Au.

<P>Complete assay results and an initial resource estimate for Skouries are expected to be available by the end of January, 1997.

<P>To date, a total of approximately 35,000 metres of drilling has been conducted on the Kassandra Mines concessions.  The results to date are confirming the previous ore reserve information provided by the Greek government and the high quality of the orebodies.
