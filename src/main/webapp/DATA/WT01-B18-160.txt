<title>Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Create Jobs</title>

<H2><i>C. </I>Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Create Jobs</H2>

Energy efficiency cuts costs, increases productivity, and reduces 
pollution - while saving and often creating jobs. Implementing 
efficiency measures that are cost effective on a life-cycle basis leads to 
more jobs, higher personal incomes, and a higher GDP for the United 
States.<a href="#58" name="r58"> [ 58 ] </a>A number of case studies demonstrate how companies have 
benefited economically - and in some cases have even been turned 
around, by investing in energy efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="SouthwireCompany,The">Southwire Company <a>.</B></I> 
The Southwire Company, 
headquartered at Carrollton, Georgia, is a large manufacturer of copper 
rod, cable and wire. Southwire had soaring energy costs in the early 
1980s, when its energy bills reached 20 percent of overhead and were 
rising. Profit margins were dropping, and the company had to lay off 1,000 
of its 4,000 workers.<a href="#59" name="r59"> [ 59 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      Between 1981 and 1988, however, a comprehensive efficiency 
program saved Southwire $40 million in energy costs. Efficiency measures 
included a particularly successful motor efficiency program. The program 
focused on the life-cycle costs of motors, comparing the costs of 
rewinding older motors with the costs of buying new, high-efficiency 
motors. Southwire purchased high-efficiency motors whenever the net 
present value of the energy savings over five years exceeded the financing 
costs. To minimize downtime, the company then stocked the motors in 
preparation for their replacement. In addition, plant operators shut off 
many motors during peak demand times to avoid excess energy costs. The $40 
million in energy savings cut overhead from 20 to 13 percent and turned 
Southwire into a profitable company.<a href="#60" name="r60"> [ 60 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     The <A NAME="KellyCompany,The">Kelly Company <a>.</B></I> As a leading manufacturer of 
injection molded and structural foam parts for the paint and hardware 
industries, The Kelly Company of Clinton, Massachusetts was a productive 
and profitable player in its industry for many years. But in the 
mid-1980s, the national recession and international competition brought 
the manufacturer to the brink of financial disaster and jeopardized the 
livelihoods of its 65 employees.<a href="#61" name="r61"> [ 61 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      Seeking to cut costs without cutting jobs, the company focused 
on reducing electricity costs, its third largest operating expense. With 
the assistance of <B><I><A NAME="MassachusettsElectricCompany">Massachusetts Electric Company<a></B></I> and the 
Massachusetts Industrial Services Program, Kelly installed variable-speed 
drives on injection molding machines, process cooling system improvements 
that included new high-efficiency pumps, and premium efficient grinders to 
reuse waste material generated by the injection molding machines. Kelly's 
electricity costs dropped 20 percent, saving $83,000 per year and enabling 
the company to expand product lines and add personnel. The efficiency 
improvements cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 7 metric tons and carbon 
dioxide emissions by 659 metric tons annually.<a href="#62" name="r62"> [ 62 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="CraneValves">Crane Valves</a>.</B></I> In the face of strong foreign 
competition undercutting the foundry business, Crane Valves of Washington, 
Iowa needed to cut manufacturing costs to save jobs. Assisted by the Metal 
Casting Center at the University of Northern Iowa, Crane-Washington 
implemented a "total assessment audit" of its plant. The audit brought in 
six public- and private-sector organizations with expertise in energy 
efficiency, productivity improvement, and waste reduction. The audit 
catalyzed a total quality management program that delineated a host of 
capital and non-capital improvement initiatives - all of which focused 
on energy-use efficiencies, productivity improvements, and process 
management. The audit assessed energy use in all process cycles, including 
the materials, equipment, and tooling cycles of foundry operations. <BR>
<p>    <p>      With funding from the <B><I><A NAME="IowaEnergyCenter">Iowa Energy Center <a></B></I> in Ames, 
Crane-Washington launched a demonstration project at its facility that 
could serve as a model for the entire foundry industry. The results are 
striking: kilowatt-hours per ton of materials were slashed by 29 percent; 
scrap was cut by 39 percent; error rates dropped by 28 percent; and the 
number of labor-hours per ton of poured materials fell 27 percent. All 
this while productivity soared: the average tons per day of materials 
poured increased an astounding 78 percent, while the number of good molds 
poured daily increased 42 percent. To top it off, new jobs increased by 30 
percent from November 1993 through October 1994.<a href="#63" name="r63"> [ 63 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="DowChemical">Dow Chemical<a>. </B></I>Often the best efficiency 
investments begin with employee suggestions, which, when implemented 
systematically, can bolster productivity and expand the company, creating 
jobs. Dow Chemical's Louisiana Division, whose 2,400 employees in more 
than 20 plants produce chemicals like propylene, began a yearly contest in 
1982 to find energy-saving projects that paid for themselves in one year 
(a return on investment of more than 100 percent) and that required a 
capital investment of less than $200,000.<a href="#64" name="r64"> [ 64 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      The first year, the program had 27 winning projects that 
required a total capital investment of $1.7 million with an average return 
on investment of 173 percent. Dow's energy manager, Kenneth Nelson, 
reported that after the first 27 projects "many people felt there couldn't 
be others with such high returns." The skeptics were wrong. The 1983 
contest had 32 winners. The projects they suggested required a total 
capital investment of $2.2 million and provided a 340 percent return on 
investment - producing savings for the company of $7.5 million in the 
first year and every year after that.<a href="#65" name="r65"> [ 65 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      The yearly contest was so successful that Dow eliminated the 
$200,000 limit and included savings from all kinds of waste reduction, not 
just energy. Winning suggestions included more efficient pumps and 
installation of heat exchangers to salvage waste heat. Others involved 
sophisticated process redesign. An ethic of "continuous process 
improvement" began to pervade the company. Employees received engraved 
plaques in a formal awards ceremony, and in addition, were often rewarded 
by their supervisors through job performance raises. <BR>
<p>    <p>      For 575 projects throughout the 1980s, the average return was 
204 percent (audited). After ten years and nearly 700 projects, the 1992 
contest had 109 winning projects with an average return of 305 percent, 
and the 1993 contest had 140 projects with an average return of 298 
percent.<a href="#66" name="r66"> [ 66 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="58"  HREF="#r58">58.</a> The positive employment and income results of efficiency 
investments are due primarily to the relatively low number of jobs in the 
energy sectors (coal, oil, and gas extraction, fuel refining, and electric 
and gas utilities) compared to the economy as a whole. Conserving energy 
reduces the energy bills paid by consumers and businesses, thereby 
enabling greater purchases of non-energy goods, equipment, and services. 
The result is a shift of economic activity away from energy supply 
industries and towards sectors of the economy that employ more workers per 
dollar received.<BR>
<p>     Less than 10 percent of the net jobs created are associated with 
direct investment in efficiency measures while more than 90 percent are 
associated with re-spending energy bill savings. The largest absolute 
increase in jobs is in the construction, retail trade and services 
industries, as these sectors install energy-efficiency measures and gain 
new business orders from the re-spending of energy bill savings.<BR>
<p>     Productivity improvements in the oil and gas extraction industries 
are likely to lead to a reduction of 200,000 jobs in this sector by 2010. 
Individual companies in the fossil-fuel sector may be able to reduce 
adverse jobs impacts by diversifying into the energy efficiency and 
renewable energy fields. Geller, H., DeCicco, J., and Laitner, S.,
