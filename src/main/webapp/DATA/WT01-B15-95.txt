Indeed, in absolute numbers we have seen some of the biggest declines of the century. In percentage terms, however, it's been the approximate equivalent of a trader's "bad hair day". Always treat those newspaper reports with skepticism. Headlines that scream "One of the ten worst market days of the century" are out to sell newspapers-not sound investment advice. I remarked last month that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was operating in a multi-month trading range. On July 16th, the Dow had a daily high-to-low fluctuation of 270 points or 4.8%. The Dow dipped through the bottom of the trading range, but closed back <i>inside</i> the trading range and above the previous days close! Oh, so what! You might say. Here's a bit of "traders rules." When a market drops on high volume then recovers later in the day to close above the previous day's close, traders refer to this as a "Reversal Day" and regard this as a bullish signal. Why? Because after the sellers dropped the market precipitously, there were still plenty of buyers willing to step in and drive prices all the way back up. Tremendous buying power is needed to reverse such a powerful downtrend. Incidentally, this "Reversal Day" happened twice, the second time nearly a week later on July 24th. It's as if large amounts of money are lurking out there waiting to buy back in. That's Institutional Money by the way, not retail fund investors like you and me. Oh, and guess who panicked and caused those few big drops over the last few weeks? The Institutions again!<p>Last month I mentioned that the US indices were heading for an oversold condition that could set the stage for a multi-month tradable rally. Well, the US markets are clearly oversold. Even volatile indices like the Nasdaq and the CBOE Biotech Index seem to have had most of the previous price excesses blown out of their indices. Keep an eye out for prices to reverse to the upside again. When? We'll have to wait until the markets show us the time to buy by changing to a positive trend.<p>By the way, while we wait to catch the next investment wave, why not try to invent something? Mr. Bill Killiam of Philadelphia has invented a type of lawn ornament (bunnies, gnomes and skunks) that speaks to visitors and takes messages. Activated by a motion detector, "The Lawn Buddy" will recite a brief message from the homeowner and take messages from visitors. Mr. Killiam says that "Everybody needs a Buddy", which probably explains why he's now working on a line of Home Buddies and Room Buddies. Don't laugh, dear readers. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a><a href="charts/cboebiot.gif">CBOE Biotech<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>28</center></body></html>
