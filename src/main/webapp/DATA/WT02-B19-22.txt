<h1>Chancellor's Industry Scholarships in Engineering (CISE)</h1>
Chancellor's Scholarships in Engineering are open to final year high
school students who expect to achieve a TER of at least 96.00 in the
HSC or interstate equivalent. They are highly competitive and many
applications are received each year for the limited number of places
available.
<P>
The Scholarships are worth $10250 in 1995. This is paid in fortnightly
instalments for the four years' duration of the normal undergraduate
course, subject to continued satisfactory academic performance.<P>
Chancellor's Scholars attend site visits to the sponsoring companies
as well as functions at the University designed to promote good
relations and personal interaction between the students and the
organisations supporting the CISE program.
<P>
During the long vacations between first, second and third year, each
Scholar is allotted to a sponsoring organisation for industrial
education placement (IEP). Unlike other engineering undergraduates who
have only one industrial placement during their time at the University,
Chancellor's Scholars have the opportunity to gain experience working
in various aspects of industry. Every Scholar works for three different
companies and every sponsor sees three different students over the four
years of the undergraduate course.
<P>
Most scholars expect to, and do join one of the sponsors on
graduation, but there is no formal obligation either way.
<P>
The CISE Program is controlled by a Steering Committee and administered
by the Faculty of Engineering.
