If you are a health professional with a special interest in alcohol and drugs, APSAD is an organisation you should consider joining. Membership is drawn from a wide variety of disciplines including biochemists and nurses, pharmacologists and health education teachers, social workers and psychologists, physicians, general practitioners and psychiatrists, nutritionists and administrators, with a common interest in drug-related problems. <p>

Principal activities of the Society include:<p>





<h2><a name="alcohol hbk The Drug and Alcohol Review"><a name="alcohol hbk app7 the drug">The Drug and Alcohol Review</h2><p>

This high quality journal is published quarterly and contains a variety of original papers and reviews and is used to a substantial extent by Australian researchers as a vehicle for publishing their research findings. All members of APSAD receive the journal as part of their subscription. In addition APSAD produces a newsletter which informs its membership of issues, initiatives and a wide range of activities that relate to alcohol and drugs.<p>





<h2><a name="alcohol hbk Postgraduate medical training"><a name="alcohol hbk app7 postgrad">Postgraduate medical training</h2><p>

APSAD has pioneered the development in Australia of a postgraduate training program for medical practitioners wishing to increase their knowledge or specialise in the area of alcohol and drugs. A Board of Censors has been established which determines and maintains appropriate examination procedures and standards. Already some trainees have completed training and others are in the process of completing their training. A number of these come from general practice.<p>





<h2><a name="alcohol hbk Methadone training"><a name="alcohol hbk app7 methadone">Methadone training</h2><p>

APSAD is presently launching a Methadone Prescribers Accreditation Course, in association with the NSW Drug and Alcohol Directorate. The goal of the program is to equip doctors with the competence required to provide methadone maintenance.<p>





<h2><a name="alcohol hbk Development of alcohol and drug policy"><a name="alcohol hbk app7 development">Development of alcohol and drug policy</h2><p>

Many APSAD members individually and collectively have been involved in advising Government on a variety of alcohol and drug policy issues.<p>





<h2><a name="alcohol hbk Conferences"><a name="alcohol hbk app7 conferences">Conferences</h2><p>

An annual conference is held in a different State each year and regional conferences are held in response to demand. APSAD arranges its workshops focusing on areas of special interest such as the management of alcohol-related brain damage, the development of hospital-based units, cocaine and cannabis use.<p>
