<h1 align=center>Former San Jose Police Chief 
<br>Joseph&nbsp;McNamara Says Yes on Proposition 215</h1>

<p><b>By Joseph D. McNamara 
<br>October 20, 1996</b></p>

<p>I SPENT 35 years as a police officer and always believed that the majority
of cops cared about people and saw their jobs as a way to protect citizens
from harm and help them when they needed assistance. Thus, it saddens me
to see some cops in a knee-jerk response oppose letting doctors prescribe
medical marijuana for patients in agony from chemotherapy, glaucoma, or
a number of other illnesses for which marijuana seems to help. </p>

<p>Allowing doctors instead of cops to decide what is appropriate medicine
is logical. Under the present law, sick people or their families are forced
to become criminals in order to get a drug that can help them. In some
cases patients simply give up and lose the will to live. </p>

<p>Recently, I met Steve Kubby. Twenty years ago, doctors told him he had
cancer and could expect to die within four or five months. But Steve Kubby
is a fighter. He went into intensive treatment only to find that it made
him desperately ill and sapped his desire to live. He then began smoking
marijuana and now at age 48 is a successful businessman with a zest for
life. He still has cancer but marijuana helps him cope with the side-effects
of treatment. There are many such people. </p>

<p>If marijuana had not been made illegal in 1937, medical research could
have been done to determine just how useful it can be as medicine. </p>

<p>Because I became a policeman when I was 21, I never tried marijuana
and still haven't. But I see no reason to be hypocritical. It does not
turn users into demons. </p>

<p>Both President Clinton and Newt Gingrich tried marijuana without going
on to harder drugs and lives of crime. Indeed, most of the police officers
I hired during my 18 years as police chief admitted in their pre-employment
interviews that they had tried marijuana. It didn't keep them from becoming
fine police officers. </p>

<p>I do not advocate using marijuana, but it is not a drug that always
leads to violence or other crime. More than 70 million Americans have tried
marijuana and very few became habitual users or career criminals. Nor has
anyone ever died from using marijuana, unlike aspirin, alcohol, nicotine
and many other legal drugs. </p>

<p>Passage of Proposition 215 will not send a message leading more teenagers
to use marijuana. In the Netherlands, marijuana is freely available, and
the per capita teenage use of the drug is less than it is in the United
States. However, passing Proposition 215 will send a message that Californians
care about helping people cope with illnesses and don't want to turn them
into criminals because some police officer disapproves of their medicine.
