<h1>The Dollar Cost of Punishment </h1>

<hr>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">In 1990 an estimated $74.2 billion was spent on
police, the courts and corrections. In 1991 state and federal </p>

<p>governments planned $6.8 billion in new prison construction,
at an average cost of $53,100 per cell. </p>

Reduction Policy, 1992)</b> </p>

height="22">It costs $32,000 a year to jail juvenile offenders,
but $4,200 to educate a student in K-12 schools. </p>

Alternatives)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">The collective operating expenditure of local police
departments during fiscal year 1990 was $20.6 billion </p>

<p>(employing 460,000 full-time people). This was 20 percent more
than in 1987, when local police expenditures were $17.2 billion. <b>(LEMAS
program, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Department of Justice,
1992)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">Law Enforcement Expenditures increased from $80
million in 1938, to more than $3 billion in 1982, and to more
than $41.5 billion by 1990. Police share of total city budgets
increased from 8 percent (1940) to 14 percent (1980). <b>(Unequal

<h2>The Human Cost of Punishment: People of Color Bear the Brunt </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">If incarceration trends continue, we will have 7.5
million people in prison before the turn of the century. Of
those, four million will be Black. There are only 5.5 million
Black men between 18 and 39 in the nation. </p>

<p><b>(National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Crime Reduction
Policy, 1992)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">23 percent of all Black men are caught up in the
criminal justice system: in prison, on probation or on parole.
There are more Black men in prison today than in college. For
every Latino male with a college degree, there are 24 behind
bars. 60 percent of inmates are either Black or Latino. (<b>Washington
Post, 11/23/93)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">Where mandatory minimums apply, Black offenders were
21 percent more likely and Latinos 28 percent more likely than
whites to receive at least the mandatory minimum prison term. <b>(Federal
Judicial Center, 1992)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">47 percent of state prisoners in 1990 were Black and
12 percent were Latino; 61 percent of state prison inmates in
1986 had not completed high school; 35 percent of jail inmates in
1989 were unemployed prior to entering jail; 39 percent of jail
inmates in 1989 free for at least one year prior to their arrest
had incomes under $5,000.<b> (Facts About Prisons and Prisoners,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, June 1992)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">In analyzing police brutality cases from January 1990
to May 1992, In These Times found out that 97 percent of victims
were African Americans or Latinos, and that white police officers
were centrally involved in 93 percent of these assaults. <b>Social

<h2>Imprisonment and Crime </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">The states with the lowest crime rates have the
lowest imprisonment rates, and states with the highest crime
rates have the highest imprisonment rates There is no evidence
that imprisonment reduces crime. <b>(James Austin and Marc Mauer,
USA Today, January 27, 1994</b>) </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">San Diego and Dallas have about the same rate of
police-to-population ratio, yet Dallas has twice as much crime
reported to the police. Cleveland and San Diego, meanwhile, have
comparable crime rates even though Cleveland has twice as many
police per capita. Moreover, Washington, D.C., has both the
highest murder rate and the most police per square foot of any
city in the Western world. There doesnt seem to be any direct
relationship between the amount of police and the crime rate. </p>

<p>Even if the nation's police forces were doubled from 1 to 2
million, we could still expect, at best, only a modest decrease
in crimes. My conclusion is that there is no law enforcement
solution to the crime problem. The factors that affect crime age,
sex, race, social class, poverty, unemployment rates,
illegitimacy, AFDC all those kinds of things are really beyond
the reach of a law enforcement community. And, therefore, crime
cannot really be materially affected by the use of law
enforcement, or even correctional strategies. <b>(Richard Moran,
Professor of Criminology, Mount Holyoke College, in an interview
with NPR)</b> <br>
