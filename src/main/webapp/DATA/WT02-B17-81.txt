<p> 
<p>
<p><b>Will we ever find inexpensive ways to produce energy and fuel 
without harming

the environment?</b><p>Let's find out, in this imaginary journey to the 
future ...
<p>
Our first stop is the year 2005.  We're in the middle of a large, busy 
city on the

U.S. West Coast. We can hear the familiar roar of internal combustion 
engines all

around us, but there are almost no toxic emissions coming from all these 
cars, trucks,

and buses; most of them emit little more than harmless water vapor.
<p>
The next stop is the year 2050.  Now we're in a more agricultural 
setting, in the

middle of the Great Plains.  On the horizon, we spot some large solar 
and wind energy

systems; they are helping to produce a new source of electricity and 
transportation fuel

without spewing tons of harmful gases or particulates into the air.
<p>

     We zoom ahead to the year 2150, to a lush, green park in the middle 
of a large

but uncrowded metropolitan area on the East Coast that's unlike anything 
we've ever

seen before.  No electric power lines are visible anywhere, the sky is a 
bright blue, and

the air smells fresh and clean.  On the horizon we can see a row of 
large storage tanks

on slender pipes that poke like tree roots into the ground.  These tanks 
store hydrogen,

which is piped into the city and used for transportation, heating, 
cooling, and electric

power by all those who live and work there.


<p>Mere fantasies?  Perhaps not--especially if we keep finding new and 
better ways

to produce and use hydrogen for our energy and fuel needs.  Researchers 
funded by

the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at our national laboratories have 
already joined

with experts at universities and in industry to explore promising new 
hydrogen

production, storage, and use technologies.  These new technologies 
should allow us to

put nature's most basic element to work for us as a versatile energy 
carrier and a clean

fuel.


<p>DOE researchers are exploring new ways to produce hydrogen for energy 
and

fuel from water, plant materials, and other sources, such as fossil 
fuels, using three

main technical approaches:  photolysis, electrolysis, and thermal 
processes.  Photolytic

research includes the investigation of photelectrochemical processes 
(which make use

of light and chemical reactions to produce hydrogen) and photobiological 
processes (in

which living things, such as plants and bacteria, use light to produce 
hydrogen).  In

electrolysis research, we are investigating novel ways to electrolyze 
water at higher

temperatures, which "splits" the water into hydrogen and oxygen.  
Research in new

thermal processes includes investigations of advanced gasification and 
pyrolysis

systems; biomass (grasses, trees, and agricultural residues) and 
municipal solid waste

are the target feedstocks (starting materials) for these thermal 
processes.


<p>In some photoelectrochemical processes, sunlight striking a 
semiconductor

immersed in water produces high-purity hydrogen gas. These processes 
make use of

the photovoltaic effect, in which semiconductors made of silicon and 
other materials

convert light directly to electricity to split water into hydrogen and 
oxygen.


<p>Solar cells similar to the ones used in space can be used to 
electrolyze the

water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. DOE-funded researchers have 
already been

able to convert 8% of the energy in solar radiation to hydrogen, as they 
work toward a

maximum theoretical efficiency of more than 20%. The goal is to reach 
15% conversion

efficiency by the year 2000 and begin commercial production of hydrogen 
with this

technique by 2010.


<p>The primary challenge is to find an appropriate semiconductor. Most

semiconductors do not generate enough voltage for this process, and they 
corrode in

water. Researchers are investigating new materials, changes in device 
surfaces, and

protective coatings on solar cells to overcome these problems. They are 
also

investigating the use of tandem cells with high voltages and different 
metal catalysts;

this is important because today's best hydrogen-producing catalysts are 
expensive.


<p>In photobiological processes, photosynthetic microorganisms -- 
bacteria and

algae, for example --  produce hydrogen directly from sewage or 
food-processing

waste.  Photosynthetic algae can generate hydrogen directly from water.  
Several

teams of researchers have already isolated a number of photosynthetic 
microorganisms

that use light to generate hydrogen.  


<p>In sunlight, without oxygen, some of these bacteria produce hydrogen 
efficiently

from soluble organic acids, such as those found in sewage or waste 
materials from

food-processing plants.  Other photosynthetic bacteria, when denied both 
light and air,

convert carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This 
makes it

possible to turn various thermal (heat-based) processes for generating 
synthesis gas

(primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into hydrogen-production 
processes. The

bacteria are so efficient that they can remove 99.99% of the carbon 
monoxide from

their surroundings while producing hydrogen at 20 times their own volume 
per minute.


<p>Exciting recent discoveries in this research program have resulted in 
the

isolation of photosynthetic microorganisms that can generate hydrogen 
even in the

presence of oxygen. This opens the door to the possibility of developing 
an industrial

process for splitting water photobiologically.  


<p>Using thermal processes such as fast pyrolysis allows us to vaporize 
biomass at

moderately high temperatures without oxygen; these vapors are then 
catalytically

reformed to produce hydrogen.  Researchers are currently investigating 
the possibility

of producing hydrogen from biomass in a fast-pyrolysis reactor. 


<p>Any of these new production technologies could develop into an 
efficient,

economical means of producing hydrogen.  And any of them could be 
combined with a

number of promising storage and utilization technologies to help 
hydrogen fulfill its

potential as the "ultimate fuel"--one that DOE predicts will join 
electricity as a primary

energy carrier in the not-too-distant future.
