Dave Ledward graduated from the University of Leeds, UK with an 
honours degree in chemistry, a MSc in Physical Chemistry and a PhD in 
Food Science.  Since graduation he has researched extensively in the 
area of macromolecular chemistry, primarily proteins and 
polysaccharide, as related to food quality.  He has published over 
120 research papers and 30 review papers in this and related areas in 
addition to editing 4 books.  this work was carried out at CSIRO, 
Australia and the Universities of London, Nottingham, Belfast and 
Reading.  Though primarily interested in the fundamental chemistry of 
these systems he has, over many years, acted as a consultant to 
several companies in the Food area, primarily companies associated 
with the Meat and Poultry Industries.  His current research interests 
include the effect of high pressure treatments on food quality, an 
area in which Reading is an acknowledge international centre.  He is 
currently a member of the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and 
Processes (ACNFP), Chairman of the Food Commodities and Ingredients 
Group of the Society of Chemical Industry, Chief Examiner for the 
Institute of Food Science and Technology and Associate Editor of Meat 
Science.  Recent publications include:
