Hot Topic -- Assisted Suicide

<h2>Dr. Death Strikes Again</h2>

<p>
A 58-year-old woman with Multiple Sclerosis is helped to
die by Jack Kevorkian in Michigan. Did she have to die? Is
Kevorkian the vangard for society to quietly dispose of people
with disabilities who might seem to be a burden? People and their
families who don't understand disability and the opportunities for
living a full invigorating life? Are people choosing death because 
they don't understand the possibilities of life?

Two points:</h3>
<p>
1.IF it is allowed, who is given the authority to decide -- that is
the 
question? Whom do you give that power of choice to.
<p>
2.It is up to the individual so kill yiurself unassisted.
Take your own responsibility--let someone else do it, like the
state and you get a Hitler whom was praised by all the
psychiatrists before he became politically incorrect.

<h3>Havy issue</h3>
<p>
The ending of one's life is heavy, HEAVY moral issue.  I think we
live in a
very enlightened society where the right to make that decision is
part of
our moral code.  Only one person can make that decision about
themselves.
No one else can, and to do so is murder.  Witness the sentence
dealt to
Robert Latimer.  For those of you unfamiliar with circumstances
surrounding
this case, he was the father of the 12 year old he carried to his
vehicle
and gassed. He has been portrayed in the media as a loving father
who
terminated his daughter's life on compassionate grounds.  I have
little
doubt the media portrayal is accurate, but mercy killing is still
murder and
my heart refuses to bleed for him.
<p>
I launched into the proceeding discussion only to illustrate my
thinking on
the distinct difference between mercy killing and the voluntary
termination
of one's own life.  Having reached approximately half of my
actuarial life
span I can emphatically say that I have no plans to avail myself of
the Dr.
Kervokians of the world. But my thinking may change as I age and
the
degenerative nervous condition I have worsens.  That brings me full
circle
to an earlier statement "where the right to make that decision is
part of
our moral code".

<h3>Some questions ...</h3>
The Assisted Suicide issue LOOKS LIKE a pretty clear cut issue of
personal freedom, choice, and dignity UNTIL one considers the
political
and systemic implications of legalizing euthanasia.  
<p>
Here are some questions to ponder...
<p>
If we legalize euthenasia, will parents who feel inconvenienced by
their
child's disability sbe allowed to simply administer a lethal
injection
and state it was for merciful reasons.  What legal recourse will we
have?
<p>
How will we protect the lives of those in nursing homes. Coercive
staff
could use the threat of death to force submission and compliance. 
Or
worse, there would be a quick legal and easy way for health care
professionals to decide who should take up beds.
<p>
Disability Rights lobbyists are struggling again a huge
conservative
fiscal-oriented government to gain access to adequate medical
treatment.  Their case is based upon the fundamental principal THAT
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE TO THE END THEIR
LIVES
AND EQUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ALL AVAILABLE MEDICAL TREATMENT. 
<p>
Conservative opponents have argued that there needs to be a
cost/benefit
expense ceiling and have thus put a price tag on the life of a
person
with a disability.  The legitmate RIGHT TO DIE arguments are now
being
used as BETTER OFF DEAD rationalizations.
<p>
Many of the respondents seem to be afraid of being forced to live
a
painful life.  I'm afraid of being GIVEN NO CHOICE BUT TO DIE.  
<p>
The right to die proponents seem to put a huge amount of faith that
that
the legalized death option would never be  misused.  I do not share
their confidence.  In fact, I see scads of evidence to the contrary
all
around me: 
<p>
- medical recommendations to abort children with disabilities; 
<p>
- hospitals routinely assigning DNR (Do Not Ressussitate) orders on
patients with a disabilities; 
<p>
- vital organ transplants being denied to people with disabilities,
even
when a suitable organ is available.
<p>
Right to die proponents maintain that "safe-guards" be put in place
to
guard against misuse.
<p>
Now let me get this straight...  Currently, it is illegal to kill
a
person with  a disability in any way and yet many people with
disabilities are literally fighting for their lives.  Right to die
proponents are suggesting that we make it conditionally legal to
kill
people with disabilities and suggest that people with disabilities
will
be safe and their lives will be protected.
<p>
Sorry guys.....your logic escapes me. Talk of safeguards doesn't
reassure me at all.
<p>
It comes down to this. If we legalize assisted suicide, then a
non-disabled person blowing his
head off with a shotgun remains an irrational and illegal act.  But
a
person with a disaability asking for a lethal dose of morphine
becomes a
rational and legal act.
<p>
Hmmm... Sounds like devalued status to  me.
<p>
If we legalize euthenasia, then a parent who kills their
non-disabled
child is charged with murder, but a parent who kills their disabled
child is set free.
<p>
Hmmm... Sounds like devalued status to  me.
<p>
If we legalize euthenasia, then a doctor is legally bound to use
any
means at his/her disposal to keep a non-disabled person alive, but
has
the right to withold treatment if the person has a disability
<p>
Hmmm... Sounds like devalued status to  me.
<p>
The Right to die proponents are so fixated on this idea of automous
choice, that they seem to be oblivious (intentionally?) to the fact
that
their actions are systematically undermining the safety and status
of
people with disabilities.
Worse than that, they seem not to care.

<h3>Another choice</h3>
We, as human beings, make a great deal of personal choices for 
ourselves every day. What we will wear to work, What we have for
lunch,
and even the way we drive to work. Shouldn't we be able to decide
when 
and where we end our lives?  After all, it is the most personal 
decision we can make.

<h3>Free choice</h3>
<p>
If you had just found out that you would die of a painful disease, 
would you not want to end you life before you had to go through it?  I 
Sure would and so does a million others.  Just because one person 
dosen't agree with it shouldn't mean that one person should have the 
right to decide for the rest of us.

<h3>My decision</h3>
<p>

I think that every person should have the right to determine their
own fate.  I cannot speak as to if I would use the doctor's tactics
 but I know that that decision would be 
mine and mine alone if I ever found myself in such a state. Death
 scares most people, 
and terrifies the rest of us.  Why should human beings deal with
 the "endless" suffering 
if we allow suffering pets to be "put to sleep"?

<h3>Pet analogy</h3>
<p>
The analogy of putting an animal to sleep is often used and, at first,
 can seem to be a persuasive argument. However much we may love our 
pets,though, I think intellectual honesty would lead us to admit that 
euthanasizing a pet is generally done when the pet's life seems too 
burdensome for us -- not the pet -- to bear.  (And, by the way, the pet 
has no choice in it.)
<p>
In fact, last week on CNBC's "Charles Grodin Show," George DeLury 
used the animal argument when he was making his case for assisted suicide, 
yet his actions bear out the fact that it was he who had the most 
difficult time dealing with his wife's disaility.
<p> 
Delury (who "assisted" his wife who had multiple sclerosis to the grave) 
had made it clear to his wife that she was a burden.  
<p>
Other comments of Delury on the same show indicate that assisted suicide 
is for the benefit of others -- not the person who would be "assisted."  
He stated, "People have to think about it in advance and be prepared to 
act to save their families a great deal of distress..."  (For more on 
Delury who "assisted" his wife's death, see Wall Street Journal 
"Euthanasia Chic" May 1,1996 and letter to the editor of WSJ from May 17.)

<h3>Remember Hitler</h3>
<p>
While it is tempting to tout Kevorkian as a crusader for the
individual's right to determine his/her own lifespan, I find the
whole concept of "assisted suicide" for persons with a "poor
quality of life" very reminiscent of Hitler's attempt, in the '30s
and '40s, to legitimize the "euthenasia" of those poor, crippled,
elderly, or feeble-minded folk that were "useless eaters," i.e., an
unwanted drain on the resources of their families and der
Vaterland. If Kevorkian and his supporters, no matter how
high-minded, win their crusade, it will not be long before [crips,
gimps, handicappers, disabled, the physically, mentally,
aesthetically challenged, you, I](pick one or more) become fodder
for a new Auschwitz. The world should not fear the physically
disabled living in our midst, but we should all look out for the
morally and spiritually disabled.

<h3>I can decide</h3>
<p>
I have always looked at suicide in terms of putting an animal to
sleep. I know that that may sound strange or odd....but I have
always found it strange that we care so very much for our pets or
some strange animal that we don't know at all that we would take
the time to make sure that they are not in pain. I had my 18-year-
old cat put to sleep (this was many years ago) because she was in
kidney failure. If she had been human I would probably been
encouraged to put her through hospitalization/medication/treatment
regiments, etc. She had led a wonderful life, she was very dear to
me and she deserved to be out of pain.
<p>
Why am I, a human being, deserving of any less humane treatment?
<p>
Why should I suffer, physically, psychically, emotionally - in any
way whatsoever. When I have reached the point where I can no longer
"take any more" why shouldn't I have the right to end my life.
<p>
Because you (the collective you) would feel too guilty. Guilty that
you didn't do anything to help someone with a mental disability.
Guilty that you didn't understand. Guilty that you were too self
absorbed to notice that there was a problem until I decided to take
my life's control into my own hands. Then, of course, because of my
diagnosis you have to rail at the moon and rally behind the cause
and say....oh, she doesn't know what is best for her....we must
take care of her and protect her from herself.
<p>
Not so, I am capable of making my decisions for myself. You just
don't happen to like most of them......that is your problem!
<p>
It is too painful for the majority of people in this country to
look at death. It is too difficult to see that there are just some
of us who view death as a release from too much pain and
suffering...be we people of physical or mental dis-eases or
dis-abilities.
<p>
Having run on too much....I will stop at that.

<h3>Why force anyone</h3>
<p>
Why would anyone want to force a TERMINALLY ILL person SUFFER when
they don't want to is beyond me. If a person who is GOING TO DIE
wants to do it a little sooner then whoever wants to FORCE them to
live and suffer LONGER is the sick one. I know people are worried
about the religious implications but that's THEIR soul, not yours.

<p>
First of all, let's be sure we refer to the issue as "the right
to be killed" rather than the "right to die".
<p>
Wanting control and asking for the most expedient way out are two
different things. Larry McAfee was a good example of this. McAfee
sued for the right to have the means to shut his respirator
off, thus giving him the same opportunity as anyone else to end
his life if he chose. He did not want to make it easy or have 
someone else do it - he simply wanted to ability to do it.
<p>
I think anyone with links to the disability community would be
well advised to monitor the publications of "right to be killed" 
organizations. They have automatically defended any self-proclaimed
"mercy killing" of a child with a disability. Peter Singer, an 
author and "bioethicist" is also popular in "right to be killed" 
publications. One of Singer's more interesting suggestions is
to give parents of newborns that have conditions such as Down
syndrome a 30 day period in which they would have the right to
order the medically supervised killing of the infant.
<p>
So... Is this movement dangeous to people with disabilties? Yes -
and it's easy to tell if you start to explore beyond the soundbites
and press releases.

<h3>Personal choice</h3>
<p>
I believe it is wrong to kill myself. However it is not up to me
or anyone else to decide for the world. I feel it is a personl 
choice whether or not to take your own life, and if the decision 
is made to end it, then help by someone who knows what they are 
doing is good to have.

<h3>
Right to choose</h3>
<p>
"Did she have to die?" That is your question. No. Does 
she have a right to determine when to die? I think so!
<p>
Having a degenerative disease is a bit different from 
just having a disability. To watch ones body slowly 
deteriorate until you can't even swallow your food 
anymore is not a life that I don't think anybody would 
want to endure. And I don't think that you would want to 
sit back and watch your loved ones suffer a long slow 
death. Would you?
<p>
Having watched a friend of mine die from Lou Gehrig's 
disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), I think that a 
person has the right to decide when they've had enough.
<p>
In the last stages of his life, when his speech could 
barely be understood, he would beg to be killed so that 
he would not have to endure this life that he was being 
forced to suffer in. He wanted to die, but this was in 
1980 when dying with dignity was not discussed openly. 
Death was inevitable, but unfortunately so was his 
prolonged suffering.
<p>
For six more months after he had thrown in the towel, he 
suffered. He gasped for breath, and choked on every 
mouthful of food until they kept him alive by feeding 
him by tube. The last six months of his life cost him 
everything that he had saved. So instead of leaving 
something for his two young daughters to grow up on, he 
left them in debt. The doctors and the caretakers ended 
up with his life savings and he paid it all to them to 
keep him alive in a life that he no longer wanted to be 
a part of.
<p>
So your ending question "Are people choosing death 
because they don't understand the possibilities of life? 
No, I think they are choosing death because they 
understand all too well the possibilities of THEIR OWN 
LIFE!

<h3>Always a loss</h3>
<p>
People should have control over their own destinies/lives.
If an individual with a disability or not wishes to extinguish
their life they should be able to do so. However, it is
always a loss and a shame when a life is lost.
