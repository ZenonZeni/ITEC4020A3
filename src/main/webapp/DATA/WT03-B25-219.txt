<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</A> the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation, is Australia's largest R&amp;D body. CSIRO
is a statutory organisation, operating under the <I>Science and Industry
Research Act of 1949. </I>The organisation is non-profit and is primarily
funded by the Commonwealth government. <BR>
<BR>
After a detailed examination of international space activities and Australian
opportunities for space-related R&amp;D, CSIRO established COSSA in 1984
as the focal point of its space activities, which total some $AUS27m per
year. COSSA's mission and strategy are described below: <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Objective</I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>To maximise the environmental, social and economic benefits to Australia
arising from research and development in space-related science and engineering.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Strategy</I></B> <BR>
<BR>
Australian contributions to international space programs continue to complement
our access to Earth Observation data for high priority programs such as
the investigation of climate change and the sustainable management of the
nation's natural resources. With stringent financial constraints upon the
world's space agencies, increased attention is being focused on the contribution
of emerging and non-space faring nations. In this context, CSIRO's important
role in international Earth Observation programs helps to maintain Australia's
profile in global space and earth science and to achieve access to valuable
data for scientific purposes. <BR>
<BR>
Provide an effective source of information, analysis and advice on global
space science and technology. <BR>
<BR>
Promote co-operation and the development of a common space science and technology
infrastructure in Australia. <BR>
<BR>
Strengthen Earth Observation research, development and demonstration activities.
<BR>
<BR>
Enhance relationships within CSIRO, between CSIRO and international space
agencies, and between CSIRO and other space science and technology stakeholders.
<BR>
<BR>
Collaborate with agencies using Earth Observation data to enhance Australia's
space activities and international profile. <BR>
<BR>
Enhance national competitiveness through the transfer of technology to Australian
space industries. <BR>
<BR>
Promote and champion CSIRO's strengths in space science technology. <BR>
<BR>
Broker and contribute to the management of complex earth Observation programs.
<BR>
<BR>
Acquire and allocate resources for space science and technology, including
the management of CSIRO's access to research aircraft facilities, within
an agreed and open set of priorities and criteria. <BR>
<BR>
Make the most effective use of the skills and resources available within
COSSA. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Specific Objectives and Planned Outcomes</I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Strengthen the ability of CSIRO's space-related research and development
to contribute to the sustainable management of Australia's natural resources.
