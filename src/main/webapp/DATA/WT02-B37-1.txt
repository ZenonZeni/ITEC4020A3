Group Says Agriculture Helped by RFG Increases

A correlation between increased ethanol usage and the reformulated 
gasoline (RFG) program is clearly shown in the most recent gasoline
utilization numbers made available by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation.

States where RFG rules have been in effect show that the market 
percentage for ethanol blends has increased compared to the same
period in 1994, said Gary Goldberg, American Corn Growers 
Association president.

In traditional farm states, demand for ethanol has dropped, but it
has increased in midwestern states that are part of the RFG program.
While usage has dropped in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, 
Ohio and a whopping 46 percent in Oklahoma, it has increased by even 
larger amounts in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Nationally, RFG use is credited for a nine percent increase in
ethanol demand.  Said Goldberg, "To those in the ethanol industry
that have tried to downplay the importance of the Reformulated 
Gasoline program, these numbers speak for themselves...[and] clearly 
show that increased demand for ethanol and increased market 
penetration is driven by access to the RFG program."

Earlier in the year, the Energy Information Agency predicted that
yearly ethanol demand will increase from 1.6 billion gallons today
to 3.03 billion gallons by the year 2010.  The increase could mean a 
700 million bushel increase in yearly corn use.  But the increase 
will only occur if RFG programs remain in place, ACGA predicts.

Goldberg said different ways are suggested to expand ethanol's role,
but it is clear that "the RFG program is the most logical and
cost-effective means to grow the market."

Higher Speeds May Increase Smog Potential in CA

With increased speed limits in California -- from 55 mph to 65 mph 
-- the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is predicting that 
increased tailpipe emissions will cause the amount of ozone forming 
pollutants in the air to rise from one percent to three percent 
almost immediately.

But stronger regulations appear unlikely, since "We already have the 
nation's most effective motor- vehicle control," according to Jerry 
Martin, air board spokesman.  He agreed new regulations were 
possible, but were not being planned at the moment.

Worst hit would be the Los Angeles basin, which ironically had just
celebrated the cleanest air in more than two decades.  Two key
pollutants -- volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides 
-- are expected to create the increase in ground level ozone.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) said it
expects that between 12 and 18 tons of VOCs will be addded daily to
the 588 tons projected for 1996, and that nitrogen oxides would add 
14 tons daily to the projected 466 tons.

In the state capital, Sacramento, itself a bastion of bad air,
discussions are under way on whether the state will drop its
requirement that all cars sold in the state in 1998 be 
zero-emissions (electric) vehicles.  Another 14 tons could be added 
to pollutants if the requirement is dropped, the Coalition for Clean 
Air lamented.

All of the estimates, however, are based on the premise that all
drivers will ratchet up the speed they drive.  The California 
Highway Patrol (CHP) reports that since the new limits went into 
effect people continue to drive much as they had before -- at around 
70 mph.  A "creep" may manifest itself in time, CHP concedes.

Europe Reduces Duty on Imported Methanol

A recent European Union (EU) announcement said the first million 
metric tons of methanol to come through customs in EU countries will
only require duty of less than half the normal amount.

Not much impact is expected on the amount of methanol imported, nor 
on exporting countries, industry analysts say.

Users of methanol in the industrial sector wanted a duty-free quota
for methanol, as was permitted last year, but the EU chose instead
to cut the tariff to four percent rather than 8.1 percent on the 
first million metric tons.

Judith Speed, international methanol manager for ICI Industrial
Products, Inc., a European methanol producer, said that "Duty-free
and reduced duty quotas were designed to work in specific, abnormal 
situations."  She added that "If quotas are continually allowed, 
they set a precedent and then you may as well have them all of the 
time."

Speed said that last year's quota was regarded by European methanol
producers as "quite reasonable," but noted that by the time the
quota went into effect, prices had begun to drop and "there really 
wasn't any need for the duty-free shipments."

One methanol producer who ships to Europe said "A four percent
reduction in the European duty is not enough for us to divert our
normal export patterns."

Added Jim Thomas, vice president of market analysis for Houston's
Bonner & Moore Associates, "You can get all the methanol you want in
Europe right now."

Speed says that European producers are not worried about the quota,
but nonetheless the European Methanol Producers Association is
asking for an investigation into the quota on principle because 
"There is a lot of 'horse-trading' going on between countries, and 
we think that should be looked into," said Speed.
