<p align="center"><b>State Looks Into Filing Tax Violations
Against Marijuana Club Proprietors</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
State officials are probing into whether proprietors of the San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club may have violated federal and
state tax laws by failing to report club revenue to the
IRS.&nbsp; Failing to report income, including income generated
through illegal activities, is against the law.&nbsp; The
allegation is the latest in a series of accusations made by state
law enforcement officials since the club was raided on August
4.&nbsp; To date, no individuals have been arrested in connection
with the club, nor have any formal charges been filed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California Bureau of Narcotics Chief Joe Doane said that the
issue of possible tax evasion arose because agents found no
documents related to the withholding of salary for Social
Security, state and federal taxes and workers' compensation for
employees of the club.&nbsp; &quot;That indicates [that club
founder Dennis Peron] was not following state and federal laws
regarding payment of taxes on salaries and benefits,&quot; argued
state attorney general's office spokesman Steve Telliano. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dennis Peron told United Press International that standard
business practices were not followed at the club because of the
underground nature of supplying medical marijuana to those who
needed it.&nbsp; &quot;Until we change the law, you have to
realize that what we are doing is illegal.&nbsp; We've had to do things
a certain way to protect the people whose lives we were trying to
help.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Californians for Compassionate Use treasurer John Entwistle
called the state's latest allegation &quot;another red
herring&quot; and reiterated that all profits were distributed
back into the club.&nbsp; &quot;If we had bought big houses, then
we'd be ashamed,&quot; he remarked.&nbsp; &quot;But we didn't;
we've all taken vows of poverty.&nbsp; There is no hidden
money.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officials report that criminal charges involving both the tax
issue as well as other facets of the club's activities may be
filed in three to four weeks. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Governor Signs Law Reinvigorating State
Medical Marijuana Research Program</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August, 1996, Boston, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
Gov. William Weld signed into law legislation (H. 2170) that
would reinvigorate the state marijuana therapeutic research
program and eventually provide for a medical necessity legal
defense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As amended by the state legislature, H. 2170 will direct the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to pass rules and
regulations within 180 days for the establishment of a marijuana
medical research program.&nbsp; Like many states, Massachusetts
had previously adopted legislation allowing for such a program,
but had never addressed the issues of funding, regulations, or viable
sources for marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation was proposed by Rep. Pat Jehlen (D-Somerville)
after communicating with a constituent who used marijuana as a
therapeutic agent to combat severe nausea.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
Legal Committee member Michael Cutler, Esq. helped draft the
legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact attorney Michael Cutler @

<p align="center"><b>Cincinnati Buyers' Club Founder Pleads
Guilty To Reduced Marijuana Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 20, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Buyers' Club,
plead guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge of trafficking in
marijuana under eight ounces and was sentenced to serve 29 days in
county jail.&nbsp; Evans will begin his sentence in
September.&nbsp; Evans had been facing three felony counts of
trafficking in marijuana within 1,000 yards of a school following
a February raid by law enforcement officers on the club's headquarters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I was facing a total of 15 years in prison; they were
offering 29 days in county jail,&quot; Evans said after he
entered his guilty plea in Kenton Circuit Court.&nbsp; Initially,
Evans had considered battling the charges on constitutional
grounds. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prosecutors agreed to reduce the charges against Evans after
conceding that his actions &quot;were not done as part of a
commercial enterprise [or] ... for purposes of
profit.&quot;&nbsp; Evans told <b>NORML</b> that the judge in the
case remarked that she believed that marijuana for medical
purposes would eventually be legal in America, but noted that
individuals have to abide by the law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked whether he would continue to operate the buyers' club
once he completes his jail term, Evans responded that it wouldn't
be &quot;in this country.&quot;&nbsp; However, he added that,
&quot;There's plenty of people lined up to take over.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans called the judgment a &quot;partial victory&quot; and told <b>NORML</b>
that a short stay in jail was a fair price for the large amount
of publicity his case generated.</p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Files Complaint<br>
After Voters Strike Down Ballot Proposal To Decriminalize
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a city ballot initiative to decriminalize marijuana
possession have filed a complaint with the Secretary of State
alleging that opponents of the measure violated state campaign
finance laws.&nbsp; The proposal was rejected by voters by a 58
to 42 percent vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaint, spearheaded by Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance,
maintains that Traverse City Police Chief Ralph Soffredine, Prosecutor
Dennis LaBelle, and others acted as a political committee but
failed to file any papers with the county clerk as required under
the Michigan Campaign Finance Acts.&nbsp; The complaint also
alleges that opponents sent out a biased flyer against the
proposal using the tax-funded mailing permit of Traverse
City.&nbsp; Bustance is demanding a new election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We've had two successful initiatory petitions filed and if
these claims [prove] substantial then we at least deserve one
fair election,&quot; Bustance said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Traverse City officials admit that the city paid to send out over
9,400 flyers in a one-time mailing, but deny that the mailing was
an attempt to influence voters against the ballot proposal.&nbsp; The
flyer was titled &quot;Marijuana: Facts to Consider.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Michigan law, a person who knowingly violates
campaign finance rules could be punished by up to a year in jail
or a $2,000 fine.&nbsp; An organization that does so may receive
up to a $20,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot had been a rocky one for marijuana
activists. Chapter organizers' 1994 initiative drive was rejected
by the city commission despite having well over the required
number of signatures, because it allegedly conflicted with state
law.&nbsp; This year's petition was devoid of legal problems, but faced
severe opposition from city commissioners who in December unanimously passed
a resolution asking residents not to sign the petition.&nbsp; The commission
later passed a resolution encouraging voters to vote against the proposal. <br>

City NORML @ (616) 264-9565.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Dutch Cities Get Into The Marijuana Business</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1996, Delfzijl, Netherlands:</b>&nbsp;
For two decades, Dutch officials have tolerated the sale of
marijuana and hashish in coffee shops; now some are going into
business for themselves. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Authorities in the town of Delfzijl are spending $294,117 to open
a coffee shop on September 1, reports the Associated Press.&nbsp;
It is modeled on a similar project in the town of Bussum, outside Amsterdam.&nbsp;
Profits from the store will fund education campaigns on drug use,
and the store will be staffed with counselors and youth workers
offering free health information on drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Of course we don't want people to use drugs, but that's not
realistic,&quot; said Delfzijl City Hall spokeswoman Marjon
Edzes.&nbsp; &quot;This is a healthier solution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite their policy of tolerating the sale of marijuana and
hashish, the number of Dutch adolescents who have ever used
marijuana is far lower than in America.&nbsp; Dutch politicians
maintain that their policy discourages hard drug use by
separating the illicit drug markets. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on comparisons between illicit drug use
rates among Dutch and American adolescents, please contact </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>

<p align="center"><b>Dole Calls For Larger Military Presence In
Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 25, Palos Park, Ill:</b>&nbsp;
Responding to figures of rising illicit drug use among
adolescents, Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole vowed to
greatly increase the role of the military in combating drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We will make drug interdiction a priority for our
intelligence services, beefing up not just technical operations
but also human intelligence operations,&quot; said Dole during a
recent campaign speech.&nbsp; &quot;We will expand the use of
military technology, including reconnaissance and satellites and area
surveillance and listening posts to track drug movements toward
our borders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole also advocated using the National Guard in domestic drug
interdiction efforts.&nbsp; &quot;Working with the governors, we
will create designated National Guard units with appropriate
training and equipment to provide a rapid response
capability.&nbsp; If we need the National Guard to move in, they'll
have the training.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Dole's proposals are nothing new,&quot; commented <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Increasing the use
of military technology to interdict drugs began under the Bush
administration at the cost of millions of taxpayers' dollars, yet
yielded few tangible results.&nbsp; Also, the National Guard has
been utilized in domestic drug enforcement -- generally marijuana
eradication -- since Congress authorized its use in 1988 by
sidestepping the Posse Comitatus Act of 1879 that forbids the use
of federal troops in civilian law enforcement.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole defended his proposals by alleging that the threat of drugs,
like the threat of terrorism from abroad, was an area where the
military had a proper role. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>

<p align="center"><b>America's Prison Population More Than
Doubles In A Decade</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
There were approximately 1.6 million men and women in the
nation's jails and prisons last year, reported the Department of
Justice.&nbsp; This figure is a 113 percent increase since 1985
and equates to one out of every 167 U.S. residents in jail or
prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since 1980 -- when the number of inmates in state or federal
prisons or in local jails stood at just over 500,000 --
incarceration growth in the United States has ballooned over 200
percent.&nbsp; According to federal statistics, the most
significant factor for this dramatic increase is drug
arrests.&nbsp; Drug offenders now comprise more than 25 percent
of all U.S. inmates, up from less than ten percent in the
mid-1980s. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While Congress and politicians are calling for tougher
sentencing and tougher judges, they are conveniently neglecting
the fact that America already incarcerates a larger percentage of
its population than any other country; this is a direct result of
the drug war,&quot; said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately, after listening to recent
campaign speeches by both the Dole and Clinton camps, it appears
this trend is far from over.&quot; <br>
