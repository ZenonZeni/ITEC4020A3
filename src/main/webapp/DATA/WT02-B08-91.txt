<H1>MARIJUANA SYMPOSIUM<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
AT THE CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacolgicum) World
Congress in Melbourne today eminent psychiatrists from around the world
discussed the issue of the legalisation of marijuana.<BR>
The symposium was chaired by Professor Bruce Singh, head of the department
of psychiatry, Melbourne University/Royal Melbourne Hospital.<BR>
<BR>
Differing views were expressed, but several times speakers made the point
that similar data was open to various interpretations.<BR>
<BR>
The American experience was outlined by Professor Fred Goodwin, director
of the Centre of Neuroscience, Medical Progress and Society, Washington
DC, and a former Director of the National Institutes of Mental Health and
the Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration in the US. He said
evidence showed that marijuana was a toxic substance. THC, the major component,
attached itself to the brain and stayed there indefinitely.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Goodwin said because of this it was false to make an analogy between
alcohol and marijuana. Alcohol was metabolised completely and was not of
the same nature as marijuana. <BR>
<BR>
Professor Jorge Costa e Silva [repeat Costa e Silva], director of mental
health and prevention of substance abuse for the World Health Organisation,
highlighted the international problems of dealing with marijuana, nicotine
and other addictive substances. <BR>
<BR>
There was general opinion in favour of preventing the use of them, but the
issue of criminalisation and legalisation was subject to a variety of political,
social, and economic pressures. <BR>
<BR>
Professor Costa e Silva said there was a planned WHO meeting later this
year, at which experts from a number of countries would evaluate the research
data and based on this would make a final report and recommendations on
an approach to member countries.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Singh said there was general consensus at the symposium that to
make the occasional use of marijuana, particularly by the young, a crime
needed to be looked at more closely.<BR>
<BR>
The danger of labelling these people criminals was far greater than the
danger of occasional marijuana use.<BR>
The issue of chronic severe use was reported from a Columbia University,
New York, study that showed a mental deterioration in the marijuana-smoking
group compared with a group of non-smokers. The smoking group had a decrease
in motivation, drive, volition and productivity on a number of neuro-psychological
parameters. <BR>
<BR>
Professor Graham Burrows, a member of the Addiction Research Institute and
head of psychiatry at Melbourne University/Austin and Repatriation Medical
Centre, said the Victorian Government should be given credit for its stance
against decriminalisation until further research is completed and welcomes
the funds provided for a strong education and research program.<BR>
<BR>
But, he added, the scientific study of drug use needed greater elaboration,
including the development of methodology to measure the effects of marijuana.<BR>
<BR>
A MEDIA conference will be held in the Press Room (2nd floor, World Congress
Centre) at 4pm tomorrow (Tuesday, 25 June).<BR>
<BR>
Topics to be discussed at the conference include Alzheimer's disease; phobias;
compulsive behaviour; eating disorders; depression; post-natal depression;
alcoholism; gender differences in mental health (why some disorders, though
not apparently hormonally related, are more prevalent among women or among
men); alternatives to drug therapy in the treatment of mental health problems
such as panic attacks and anxiety disorders.<BR>
<BR>
Those taking part in the conference will include Dr Phillippe Robert, the
Memory Centre (department of psychiatry), Nice University; Dr Murray Stein,
the University of California at San Diego; Dr Carol Nadelson, professor
of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and president of the American Psychiatric
Press; Professor James Ballenger; Professor Colin Masters, head of the pathology
department, Melbourne University; Dr Keith Wesnes; Dr Zachary Stowe, school
of medicine, Emory University, USA; Professor Uriel Halbreich, State University
of New York at Buffalo; Professor Lorraine Dennerstein; Dr Ellen Freeman,
Pennsylvania University medical centre.<BR>
