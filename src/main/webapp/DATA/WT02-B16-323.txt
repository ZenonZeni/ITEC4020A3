<B>Annex 11 -- Integrated Systems</B>
<P>
The objective of this International Energy Agency annex is to develop a 
tool to assist in 
the design and evaluation of potential hydrogen demonstration projects as 
well as in the 
refinement of existing projects.  The emphasis will be on integrated 
systems and cover all 
components, from input energy to end use.  Activities will focus on 
near-term and mid-term 
applications, with some consideration of the transition to sustainable 
hydrogen energy 
systems.
<P>
For hydrogen to become a competitive energy carrier, experience and 
operating data 
need to be generated and collected through demonstration projects.  
Hydrogen technologies 
must advance beyond the proof-of-concept stage before people will make 
significant investment in changing the infrastructure.  Using hydrogen 
for energy and fuel has potential environmental and efficiency advantages 
over continuing to use conventional fossil fuels.  However, technical and 
cost issues may prevent widespread use unless we construct a framework 
encompassing scientific principles, technical expertise, and analytical 
evaluation and assessment.  Existing and proposed demonstrations of 
hydrogen energy systems typically demonstrate technologies at different 
levels of development.  Combining data collection, demonstration case 
studies, component simulation, and integrated systems modeling can assist 
us in developing design guidelines for future demonstrations.
<P>
Countries participating in this effort include Canada, Italy, Japan, the 
Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States (Operating Agent).

<I>Recent Activities</I>:
<P>
Following the Subtask Leaders meeting on July 17-18, 1995, the revised 
work plan and schedule were distributed to members from the participating 

countries for review and approval.  After all approvals were received, 
work began in 
September 1995.  Initial data collection is under way, and a survey has 
been 
distributed to the participating countries to identify and characterize 
existing or 
historic hydrogen demonstration projects.
