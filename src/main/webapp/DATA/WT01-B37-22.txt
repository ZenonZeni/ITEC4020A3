<p><font size="5">The National Guard is not a police force<br>
</font><font size="2"></font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara<br>
<strong>San Jose Mercury News</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>November 5, 1993<br>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Let's get real. Calling out the National Guard
to police cities will not stop crime and violence any more than
chiding Hollywood about violent programming will we need to talk
about race and inner city culture and stop chasing diversions.
Even in the United States, we have to be constantly vigilant
against creeping totalitarianism.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sharon Pratt Kelly, the mayor of Washington,
recently sought authority to call out the National Guard to help
stop the killings in the nation's capital. Fortunately, President
Clinton denied the request.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">While the Guard has recently been used in
Puerto Rico and Sumter, S.C., for policing, my own experience as
a police officer in New York's Harlem during the 1960s riots and,
later, as a police chief is that the National Guard isn't even
that efficient in its traditional role of quelling disorder.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Guardsmen panicked at Kent State University in
1970 and fired into a crowd of demonstrating students, killing
four. During the urban riots of the 1960s, the Guard's record was
even worse. In Detroit, nervous Guardsmen fired at imaginary
snipers and 40 people died while the disorder continued for days.
More recently, in Los Angeles after the first verdict in the
Rodney King beating case, the Guard, after being alerted well in
advance, took the field only after the game was over and smoke
from the burning city closed Los Angeles Airport for three days.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">This is not to fault individual Guardsmen - who
get only a few weeks training a year in military combat. Policing
simply isn't their job. We should remember what Gen. Colin L
Powell said: &quot;A soldier's duty is to kill the enemy.&quot;
But the duty of a police officer is something far different: to
protect life and property and to arrest criminals within due
process of law.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Under our democratic system, military personnel
have no legal or traditional basis for doing routine policing For
so many years, that was the image of Iron Curtain nations, who
needed to clamp down on their own people.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Just as it is unrealistic to expect the police
to stop violence flowing from the decay of inner-city
neighborhoods, it is silly to think that rifle-toting Guardsmen,
riding around in jeeps with no idea of what they are expected to
do, will make people safer. After the initial shock, the presence
of troops wears off. Street criminals quickly realize the Guard
can't use their military weaponry any more than cops are allowed
to shoot without cause. In addition, soldiers are too
inexperienced to make arrests with the same savvy cops have.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The truth America shirks from is that the
national rate of violence is high, but it is about the same as it
was 20 years ago. However, violence is much worse in poor,
minority neighborhoods. The No. I cause of death for young, black
men is homicide. While a few racists may think that
African-Americans are predisposed to violence, the overwhelming
majority of people know this a foolish idea. This means we should
look for root causes of violence in the culture of inner cities.
It is clear that the curse of slavery and subsequent
discrimination, along with unwise government policies on welfare,
housing and education, encouraged the development of an urban
underclass that commits much - but certainly not all - of today's
troubling violence.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This is not to excuse such conduct. For
everyone's safety, violent criminals need to be quickly and
firmly punished and separated from society. However, it is far
better to avoid having innocent people victimized in the first
place. That means we must do a better job in understanding the
culture that produces so many young people with no respect for
the life and property of others.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Declarations of wars against crime and drugs by
politicians will not be any more effective than former Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates threats against gang leaders.
The sweep arrests accompanying such rhetoric get thrown out of
court and petty arrests take scarce police officers off the
streets. Worse still, such police tactics undermine what does
work - partnerships between local people and the police to clean
up the neighborhoods.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the long run, it will be neighborhood people
who change the negative values leading kids to destructive
behavior. The government should cheer such local leadership and
empower neighborhoods to change things. We tried the
law-and-order model for the past decade - quadrupling the number
of people behind bars - but the crime rate is about the same.
It's time to stop doing more of what hasn't worked.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A couple of immediate suggestions that would
help are to let local neighborhoods ban guns. Not only would it
prevent senseless violence, it would repudiate the macho
mentality that causes so many assaults. In addition, we should
stop continually asking for more police than we can afford and
pay more attention to police-operations that take cops off the
street. Many departments still have lots of cops doing clerical
tasks that would be better accomplished by non-sworn personnel</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, such simple solutions do not satisfy
the political craving to. show voters you are &quot;tougher&quot;
on crime than your opponents. On the other hand, if elected
officials really want to do something about crime, they have to
replace the hot air with cold logic.<br>
