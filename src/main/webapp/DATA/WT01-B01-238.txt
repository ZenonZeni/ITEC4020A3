SEA Experience is an intensive, five-week, summer seminar in marine
sciences for K-12 teachers. Through
combined study ashore and practical experience at sea and conducting
oceanographic research, SEA Experience enables teachers to develop:
<UL>
<LI>new ideas for field, laboratory and classroom work;
<LI>multidisciplinary ocean curriculum development ideas;
<LI>activities that help students discover and understand fundamental
concepts in science;
<LI>knowledge of the interrelationships between oceans, atmosphere
and land;
<LI>a professional support network of teachers across the country.
<BR>

</UL>

<P>The Shore 
Component is a rigorous and progressive three-week period.
Its focus is to introduce concepts in oceanography in lectures,
group discussions, laboratories, activities and field excursions</A>.
Supplementary lectures and discussions and hands-on workshops
cover selected topics in nautical science -- to prepare teachers
for their time at sea handling a research vessel under sail, and
in maritime studies -- to provide a historical and literary perspective
to ocean study.
<P>
During the ten-day Sea Component, teachers go to sea aboard the
Sailing School Vessels <I>Westward </I>and <I>Corwith Cramer</I>
and test the theories introduced on shore in a hands-on setting
while conducting oceanographic research projects. In lectures
and daily shipboard laboratory work, teachers are instructed in
the operation of basic oceanographic data, and in the attendant
operations of sailing a research vessel.
<P>
During the research cruise, a 24-hour watch schedule is maintained.
Individual and small group instruction takes place during watch
standing. Each participant stands two watches a day, usually one
on deck and one in the laboratory. The Swedish watch system (two
six hour watches during the day and three four-hour watches at
night) gives each participant the opportunity to perform all tasks,
including engine room and galley duty, at various times of the
day.
<P>
Upon completion of the program, teachers are expected to hold
two in-service workshops using SEA Experience as their base. If they 
choose to pay the optional $270 fee, participating teachers in SEA Experience 
earn 5 graduate credits from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
<P>
SEA has received generous funding for SEA Experience from the
National Science Foundation (NSF) and The William H. Donner Foundation, Inc.
These grants cover tuition and living expenses throughout the
program for up to 46 teachers.  Participants receive a total stipend of 
$2,200 to help defray the estimated costs of $850 (not including the
$270 fee to UMass).  In addition, teachers' school or districts are 
responsible for payment of $750 toward SEA Experience.<HR>
