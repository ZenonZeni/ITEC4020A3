Lake Obabika North Old-growth Forest

</B></CENTER><P><BR>
Temagami's Lake Obabika North area served to focus attention in Ontario on old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems.  In June 1996, the Minister of Natural Resources confirmed that the government is adding a 3,520-hectare area to Obabika River Provincial Park, to protect the old-growth forest red and white pine site.<P>

Protection of the Lake Obabika North old-growth site is part of a provincial conservation strategy for old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems being implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR).  This conservation strategy will ensure that all generations continue to enjoy these important resources.<P>

The province will accomplish its conservation goals by setting aside selected old-growth red and white pine areas for protection, and by managing others to enable them to retain their old-growth characteristics during sustainable forest management.<P><BR>

<B>A Valuable Resource</B><P>

The Lake Obabika North old-growth red and white pine forest is located on an upland, broken-sandy-till plain landform.  The site is the best representative old-growth red and white pine-dominated conifer and mixed forest on this landform in the Temagami area.  The forest was first identified in the Iles report of 1990, which detailed the results of a study designed to provide an inventory of old-growth red and white pine stands in the area.<P>

The Lake Obabika North old-growth site contains trees that are 130 to 300 years old.  Tree height and diameter varies over the site, with a maximum height of 30 metres and diameter of 75 centimetres.  Typical characteristics of old-growth forests include large live trees, standing dead tree snags and fallen logs on the forest floor.  Other notable features include large live trees with old fire scars, and younger seedlings and sapling pine that indicate the ecological role of recurring forest fires in maintaining conditions for the regeneration of the forest.  Much of the Lake Obabika North pine forest shows no sign of having ever been disturbed.
 The Lake Obabika North old-growth red and white pine forest supports a healthy mix of other tree species -- as well as the Temagami area's highest concentration of old-growth red and white pine -- and is important to the Aboriginal people living in the area.<P>

The forest landscape is quite distinctive, with extensive cliff and talus slopes, cold seepage springs and bogs.  The high relief associated with the area and the undisturbed old pine landscape of the ridges and hillsides contribute to its aesthetic quality.  Much of the area selected for protection has been identified as a provincially significant Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI).<P><BR>

<B>Size and Location</B><P>

Obabika River Provincial Park's original area was about 17,000 hectares.  In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding 3,520 hectares to the park, specifically to protect the Lake Obabika North old-growth site, which occupies parts of Shelburne and Delhi Townships, at the north end of Obabika Lake, and extends west from the lake along the Obabika River, north to Wakimika Lake, and east to Bob Lake.<P><BR>


<B>Allowable Activities/Access</B><P>

A range of recreation- and tourism-oriented activities will be allowed in this provincially protected old-growth area.  Such activities can include wildlife viewing, fishing, hunting and camping, as well as other forms of low-impact recreation.  Scientific research, environmental monitoring and outdoor education will also be encouraged.<P>

To ensure that the area's natural values are protected, commercial timber harvesting, mining and mineral exploration, hydroelectric development, new road construction and other industrial activities will not be allowed.  Access to the site, which is on one of Ontario's most popular canoe routes, will generally be by canoe or boat.<P>

Detailed planning for the Lake Obabika North old-growth area will be done as part of the development of the provincial park management plan.<P>
