<H3>1. California DSM Successes<BR>
<BR></H3>

DSM programs in California provided net life-cycle benefits of $2.2 
billion during the period 1990 to 1994.<a href="#79" name="r79"> [ 79 ] </a>In 1994, the average cost of 
saved kilowatt-hours was less than two cents per kilowatt-hour.<a href="#80" name="r80"> [ 80 ] </a>By 1994, 
California DSM programs were saving   1 percent of system consumption each 
year - and companies and residences were not even touching the limits 
of their efficiency capacity.<a href="#81" name="r81"> [ 81 ] </a><P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><I> <p>     Pacific Gas and Electric</I>.</B> Pacific Gas and 
Electric (PG&E), California's largest utility, was one of the first in the 
country to implement utility efficiency programs. PG&E's Direct Assistance 
programs, over their ten-year history, have weatherized more than 600,000 
low-income homes with attic insulation, weather stripping, shower heads, 
caulking, water heater blankets, and duct wraps, at a total program cost 
of $245 million.<a href="#82" name="r82"> [ 82 ] </a>In addition, since 1987, the program has replaced more 
than 90,000 appliances - primarily refrigerators that exceed federal 
appliance efficiency standards, but also furnaces, evaporative coolers, 
and water heaters - with energy-efficient models at no charge to 
low-income customers. It also installed more than 70,000 compact 
fluorescent lamps. In 1992, the programs saved 16,283 megawatt-hours of 
electricity, which prevented 5,585 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions. Over their life-cycle, however, the efficiency installations 
from 1987 through 1992 saved 1,901 gigawatt-hours, resulting in a 
cumulative reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 652,000 metric 
tons.<a href="#83" name="r83"> [ 83 ] </a>
<p>         PG&E's Model Energy Communities Pilot Project targeted the 
Antioch/Brentwood area northeast of Oakland, California, which was slated 
for construction of a new substation to handle a spike in demand when 
homeowners concurrently switched on air conditioners at the end of summer 
workdays. PG&E installed innovative demand-side management technologies 
that targeted this specific community, including compact fluorescent 
bulbs, low-flow shower heads, shell improvements, duct repair, insulation, 
sun screens, and air-conditioner tune-ups. PG&E also downsized 
air-conditioner units to better fit room conditions.<a href="#84" name="r84"> [ 84 ] </a>At a cost of $8.9 
million, PG&E saved 4,322 megawatt-hours of electricity between 1991 and 
1993, which prevented 1,482 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Over 
the life-cycle of the energy saving installations, 86.4 gigawatt-hours are 
expected to be saved, corresponding to a cumulative carbon dioxide 
reduction of nearly 30,000 metric tons.<a href="#85" name="r85"> [ 85 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="SouthernCaliforniaEdison">Southern California Edison<a></I>.</B> Southern California 
Edison (SCE) created one of the more innovative lighting DSM programs when 
it awarded compact fluorescent lamp manufacturers wholesale rebates of $5 
per unit, creating a "downstream" price reduction at the retail level. 
Because retailers traditionally double or treble their wholesale costs, 
customer rebates reached as high as $15 with each $5-per-bulb 
manufacturer's rebate. The wholesale rebates spurred manufacturer 
participation, while bulk rebates allowed SCE to stipulate performance 
specifications during manufacturing, including minimum efficiency 
requirements for each bulb. SCE achieved high participation by both 
residential and commercial consumers, while transforming the market away 
from old, inefficient incandescent lighting.<a href="#86" name="r86"> [ 86 ] </a>Residences saved 101,057 
megawatt-hours of electricity annually because of the program, a reduction 
in demand that cut carbon dioxide emissions by 34,650 metric tons each 
year. Carbon dioxide reductions over the life-cycle of the new bulbs will 
total 225,300 metric tons. Commercial customers saved 118,979 
megawatt-hours per year, with annual carbon dioxide reductions of 40,800 
metric tons and life-cycle reductions of 265,250 metric tons.<a href="#87" name="r87"> [ 87 ] </a>The 
combined cost of the residential and commercial programs from 1992 through 
1994 was $14,425,429. <P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="SacramentoMunicipalUtilityDistrict">Sacramento Municipal Utility District<a></I>.</B> The 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) is a case study of an 
impressive utility turnaround. On the heels of a voter referendum to shut 
down its Rancho Seco nuclear power plant in the late 1980s, SMUD closed 
the plant and ushered in a new era at the utility. SMUD set out to secure 
800 megawatts from DSM programs and 400 megawatts from renewable energy 
sources. Under the leadership of David Freeman, SMUD boosted its DSM 
budget from $3.8 million to $38 million in 1991.<BR>
<p>    <p>      By 1993, SMUD's Energy-Efficient Refrigerators program, for 
example, had resulted in purchases of more than 70,000 energy-efficient 
refrigerators while 63,000 old, inefficient refrigerators were collected 
and recycled. SMUD's Direct Investment Program has provided electric-heat 
customers with almost 15,000 energy-efficiency measures for free. 
Participants in the Residential Peak Corps Program, SMUD's leading 
load-management program, have installed 96,130 air-conditioning cyclers. 
Participants in the Shade Tree Program have planted 109,000 trees, and 
1,200 solar water heaters have been installed through the Solar Domestic 
Water Heater Program, which SMUD has expanded to promote rooftop solar 
photovoltaics. Equally impressive results have accrued from SMUD's 
commercial and industrial retrofit programs.<a href="#88" name="r88"> [ 88 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      These programs saved, in 1993, 96.4 gigawatt-hours of 
electricity - which avoided 33,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions in that year. During the life-cycle of SMUD's DSM and 
renewable-energy programs, including all efficiency installations made 
between 1978 and 1993, 4,039 gigawatt-hours will be saved, including 309 
megawatts of capacity savings, at a total cost of $196 million. That 
represents a reduction of 1.38 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions.<a href="#89" name="r89"> [ 89 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      SMUD helped one of its industrial customers, <B><I><A NAME="BlueDiamondAlmonds">Blue Diamond Almonds</a>,</B></I> become significantly more energy efficient. Blue Diamond 
installed energy-efficient lighting in its warehouses and offices, saving 
$52,000 annually. Heating equipment upgrades added another $18,000 in 
annual energy savings. A similar SMUD-supported energy-efficiency program 
for <B><I><A NAME="Intel">Intel<a>, </B></I>the large semi-conductor manufacturer, convinced 
the company to expand its operations in Sacramento, adding 250 jobs.<a href="#90" name="r90"> [ 90 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     California Energy Commission</B></I>. The California 
Energy Commission (CEC) seeks to cut the energy demand of local government 
facilities through its "Energy Partnership Program," which provides 
technical and financial assistance for energy upgrades at city and county 
facilities throughout California. The program has supplied technical 
assistance to existing public facilities, providing efficiency upgrades 
(compact fluorescent lamps, ballasts, occupancy sensors, thermostat 
controls, energy management systems, variable frequency drives, HVAC 
improvements) to city halls, administration buildings, libraries, fire and 
police departments, jails, hospitals, and wastewater treatment plants. CEC 
facilitates project financing through its own revolving loan fund, federal 
funds, utility assistance, energy service companies, or other outside 
funding sources.<a href="#91" name="r91"> [ 91 ] </a>The Energy Partnership Program has been a dramatic 
success, saving 15.7 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 1992 at a cost of 
$6.5 million, while preventing 5,385 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions. Cumulative savings include 165.9 gigawatt-hours from upgrades 
installed from 1989 through 1993, avoiding 56,900 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide emissions at a total cost of $17.3 million.<a href="#92" name="r92"> [ 92 ] </a>
