<H2>MH CONSUMERS:  WELCOME TO NAMI</H2>

<HR>
<strong>If you are a consumer of mental health services,</strong>
<P>
<strong>Welcome to NAMI!</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>"We care, because we've been there."</blockquote>

<strong>NAMI Consumer Council</strong>
<P>
Thank you for contacting NAMI, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  We hope the enclosed information is helpful to you.
<P>
NAMI is people:  people who care, people who understand, and people who are working to improve the lives of all of us who are affected by serious mental illnesses.  We know what it's like to struggle with symptoms of mental illness and the challenges that go with them because we have the same problems.  
<P>
If you are someone who has difficulties with depression, anxiety, disordered thoughts, or other psychiatric symptoms that have a biological basis, we are glad to hear from you.  We hope you will find help and hope with us.
<P>
<strong>What is NAMI?</strong>
<P>
We're a national network of people working to improve the lives of all of us affected by serious mental illnesses (such as depression, bipolar disorder or manic depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder).  Our goal is to enable each individual who has one of these illnesses to live the best life possible.
<P>
Most of us have a relative who has an illness or we have an illness ourselves.  We educate ourselves and the public, promote better treatment and support services, and advocate for research into the causes and treatments of these medical illnesses.  Through these means, we are making progress toward that goal.
<P>
<strong>What is Mental Illness?</strong>
<P>
Serious mental illnesses are biological brain diseases.  As diabetes is a disease of the pancreas, mental illnesses are diseases of the brain that disrupt a person's thinking, feeling, moods, and ability to relate to others.  Scientific research has shown biochemical imbalances or other functional problems that interfere with normal brain processes.  
<P>
The causes are not yet completely understood.  Since these disorders often run in families, genetic factors may be involved, creating a predisposition in some individuals.  Stressful life events such as job, financial, or marital problems may then trigger the onset of symptoms.  Mental illnesses are not the result of personal weakness, lack of character, or poor upbringing.  No one is to blame.
<P>
Fortunately, many effective treatments are available.  As a diabetic takes insulin, most of us with serious mental illnesses need medications to help control symptoms.  Supportive counseling and self-help groups assist in managing our day-to-day lives.  Housing, vocational rehabilitation, income assistance and other community services can provide support and stability so we can focus on recovery.
<P>
Although living with these disorders is challenging, many of us have learned to lead productive, satisfying lives. By educating yourself, learning from, and helping others affected by these illnesses, we're confident that you can too.  That's where NAMI can help.
<P>
<strong>How Can NAMI Help Me Learn about My Illness?</strong>
<P>
We have many resources for people living with mental illnesses:<br>

<UL>
<LI>Brochures and fact sheets.  Up-to-date scientific information on different illnesses, medications, and treatments.  (Single copies are free through our 800 Helpline.)

<LI>A resource catalog of books, tapes, and posters. (Also available through the Helpline if one is not enclosed.)

<LI>A network of local and state affiliates (AMIs) that offer educational meetings, family support groups, advocacy, and information about local services.  Some affiliates sponsor consumer self-help groups or can refer you to the closest one.  

<LI>A bimonthly newsletter, the NAMI Advocate, full of timely, practical information:  legal and legislative updates, research findings, book reviews, fact sheets, and more.  (Sample copy free; subscription comes with membership.)

<LI>Annual convention.  Consumers and family members from around the country meet together to network, hear the latest developments in scientific research and community services, and renew their enthusiasm for advocacy.  Consumer scholarships are often available through local affiliates.
</UL>
<P>
<strong>What are the Opportunities for Consumers in NAMI?</strong>
<P>
 Consumers participate in all levels of the NAMI organization:<br>
<UL>
<LI>We belong to local affiliates, and attend educational meetings and support groups  to learn to manage our illnesses better.

<LI>We participate in advocacy activities to improve mental health services. 

<LI>We serve as support group leaders, public speakers, board members, and Helpline volunteers.  

<LI>We testify at congressional hearings and speak to the media about our experiences.  
</UL>
<P>
In other words, if NAMI's doing it, consumers are a part of it!
<P>
NAMI's Consumer Council brings consumers together to share concerns and to promote positive consumer involvement in NAMI and in society.  
<P>
Each state selects a representative and alternate to the Consumer Council.  Every three years the Council elects a representative to serve on the NAMI Board of Directors.
<P>
The Consumer Council meets annually at the NAMI convention to share news and handle business.  We encourge all consumers to attend the convention and participate in the meeting.  
<P>
<strong>How Can I Get Involved?</strong>
<P>
The local AMI affiliate in your area is a place to meet and learn from others, and to let others learn from you.  Call for a schedule of activities, and attend those of interest to you.  Educational meetings present information about illnesses, treatments and services.  Advocacy and public education activities offer opportunities to develop new skills.  Volunteer your time and assistance.  There is always plenty to do for those willing to help.
<P>
Call the Consumer Council representative in your state for information about consumer activities.
<P>
Attend the NAMI annual convention, or your state AMI's annual convention.
<P>
(A list of affiliates in your state and the name and address of your state's Consumer Council representative is included with this brochure, or you may call the NAMI Helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI.)
<P>
<strong>How Can I Join NAMI?</strong>
<P>
You can become part of NAMI by either joining the local and/or state affiliate or by joining NAMI directly.  Local and state groups set their own membership dues; many have a low-income or consumer rate.  If you choose to join at the national level, the annual dues are $25.  Low-income consumers are invited to join by paying whatever they can (minimum of $1).
<P>
<strong>A Few Words from Two of Our Consumer Members</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>"NAMI gave me a lot of support as I worked through my recovery from mental illness.  Through consumers and family members working together in partnership, NAMI has been in the forefront of legislative efforts around the country on behalf of people with mental illness."

-- Bryce Miller, Topeka, Kansas (Treasurer of Kansas AMI and member of NAMI Board of Directors)</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>"Support and education from the local Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AMI) group is so therapeutic and helpful.  As an AMI volunteer you begin to help other people, and that is a great leap toward recovery.  It's fun to go to meetings to see people who have become friends, to feel camaraderie and mutual respect, and to share a mission with them.  When I went to the NAMI convention in San Antonio, I felt like I had come home."

-- Donna Orrin, Ann Arbor, Michigan
(Board Member and Public Relations Chair, AMI of Washtenaw County) </blockquote>
