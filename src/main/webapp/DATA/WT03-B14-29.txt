Finding quality information covering the events that shape the culture in third world countries can be a difficult task, especially if you rely solely on the American news media.  Dr.  William Close discovered the value, timeliness and breadth of NewsNet's international newswires in finding exactly this type of information.  For many years, Dr.  Close has relied on NewsNet to help keep him informed on the current happenings in Zaire, where he lived and worked for 16 years, as well as several other Central African Countries.<P>

Dr.  Close, who first went to live in Zaire in 1960, has extensive experience with third world countries.  He served as the personal physician to the President of Zaire, the chief doctor for the Congolese army, and as manager of a 2,000-bed hospital.  When the first Ebola epidemic struck in Zaire in 1976, he ran logistics for the team of international scientists who dealt with the epidemic.<P>

Since his return to the U.S.  in 1976, Dr.  Close has maintained regular contact with his associates in Zaire and helps to facilitate medical relief by acting as an unofficial liaison between the Center for Disease Control and the Zairian government.  Dr.  Close, has become a regular NewsNet user in order to stay current with news and events taking place in Zaire and other countries, and finds that the international newswire services provide the best coverage for his needs.<P>

One topic he monitors regularly on NewsNet is the Ebola virus.  Drawing on his experiences living in Africa, Dr.  Close wrote a documentary novel this year titled "Ebola," published by Ballantine/Ivy.  The book deals with events in the tropical rain forests before the arrival of the scientists.  It is the story of people involved in a terrifying intrusion seen through the eyes of a Flemish nun.<P>

Dr.  Close is an avid NewsFlash user, he finds it to be particularly useful while he's traveling.  "With NewsFlash," he said, "I can keep up to date with what's going on all over the world."  Too many people today are misinformed about third world countries, according to Dr.  Close, and keeping up to date with the help of NewsNet and NewsFlash is one way individuals can combat this problem for themselves.  "If you have NewsNet," he related, "you can download tailored information in order to be well informed in the areas relating to your particular interests."<P>
