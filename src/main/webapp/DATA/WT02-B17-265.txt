<P>Tips for efficient use of heating and cooling systems:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>During Both Heating and Cooling Seasons, clean or replace furnace and air conditioner filters regularly.  
<LI>Keep outside units free from leaves or debris that may clog vents.  
<LI>Close off unoccupied rooms and shut their heat or air-conditioning vents; or turn off  room air conditioners.  (This does not apply if you have a heat pump system, since shutting vents could harm a heat pump).  
<LI>Use kitchen, bath and other ventilating fans wisely.  In just one hour, these fans can blow away a house full of warmed or cooled air.  Turn them off just as soon as they have done their job.
