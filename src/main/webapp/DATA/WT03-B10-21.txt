BARCLAYS LAUNCHES SHARE DEALING BY VIDEO

Barclays Bank has unveiled the BarclayZone interactive sharedealing and
information service, a prototype version of which went live on Monday
in three branches, Fenchurch Street, City of London, Crawley, West
Sussex, and Maidstone, Kent.

The system, developed by Barclays Multimedia, the bank's interactive
technology unit, has no keyboard, and customers operate the terminal by
touching the screen. The menu of options includes simple tutorials
about financial topics such as the stock market. For #2.50, paid by
credit card, users can obtain investment opinions on any of 100 FTSE
and a further 25 popular stocks from a printer built into the system.
It also offers a real-time account of City news via a MarketEye screen.

Unlike the touchscreen PC-based sharedealing service which National
Westminster Bank has operated in its high street network since 1986,
BarclayZone includes a videoconferencing link to an adviser at Barclays
Stockbrokers' head office in Glasgow. This is used for buying and
selling shares, with dealing costs starting at #15, the same as dealing
by telephone.

The same video technology could allow Barclays, subject to customer
acceptance, to offer a broad range of financial services such as
insurance, tax services and mortgage advice through computer screens in
bank branches or kiosks in public places. Last year, it set up
BarclaySquare, an Internet-based electronic shopping mall, as well as
an interactive information service for its customers on the Internet.

SILICON GRAPHICS EXPERIENCES REVENUE SLOWDOWN

Silicon Graphics, the US graphics workstation vendor, warned that
earnings per share for its second quarter to 31 December 1995 would be
around 30 cents, down from 34 cents a year earlier. It also said
revenues would rise by only 23% to $675m from $550m in the same quarter
of 1994.

Analysts had predicted 43 cents a share and a 40-45% increase in
revenues for Silicon Graphics' second quarter. Following the profit
warning, which led to an immediate 16% drop in Silicon Graphics' share
price, analysts cut their earnings estimates for the financial year to
30 June 1996 by 15-20%.

Chairman Edward McCracken said revenue growth in Europe and North
America had not met the company's expectations, due to a slowdown in
sales to the US government as a result of federal budget uncertainties
and also to economic slowdowns in the UK, France and Germany. Sales via
third party channels were below expectations, he added. Revenues were
also affected by customers who decided to wait for a new range of high-
performance Silicon Graphics computers due to be launched this month
based on the new R1000 microprocessor.

Silicon Graphics has been experiencing annual revenue growth of 45-50%
over the last few years, more than double the growth rate for the
entire workstation market. Capitalising on demand for graphical
workstations in fast-growing markets such as video editing, Web site
design and computer game development, Silicon Graphics is now number
three behind Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.

Analysts said that although Silicon Graphics faces a threat from
aggressive price cuts by Sun Microsystems and the new breed of high-
specification multimedia PCs, it does not face any long-term problems.
Its 23% second quarter growth rate is above the industry average, for
example, and its new Indigo2 Impact workstation, launched in the second
quarter, has received an "outstanding" response from customers.

EPIC RECEIVES 3I CASH INJECTION

Brighton-based Epic Multimedia Group has received #1m in funding from
venture capitalists 3i.

EMG, which was set up in 1985 as a multimedia production company
working for corporate clients such as the BBC, National Westminster
Bank and BT, will use the funding to expand its consumer game and
educational CD-ROM publishing activities. "We are looking to develop
our own content with reduced involvement from large publishing co-
funders", says managing director Jim Brathwaite.

EMG is also preparing for a flotation sometime next year, says newly-
appointed finance director Andrew Duncan. However, Mr Duncan stresses
that the timing and access route for a public offering have yet to be
determined. The options under review include joining London's new
Alternative Investment Market for smaller stocks or a full listing on
the Stock Exchange. New York's Nasdaq is also a possibility, given the
importance of the US market to EMG, Mr Duncan says.

EMG, which in November 1995 completed a #1m private placing of
convertible loanstock with Henry Cooke Lumsden, has quadrupled in size
over the last two years and now has a staff of around 150. In May 1994
it raised #1.5m from UK venture capitalists Quester and from Dutch-
based Atlas Venture.

In an interview published in the Financial Times management report
Financing Multimedia in Europe by Janet Robson, Gerard Montanus of
Atlas Venture said that Atlas sees multimedia as a specific niche
market within IT. Multimedia companies such as EMG are currently
regarded and valued more like IT businesses than as publishing
businesses, Mr Montanus suggested. Atlas typically invests in companies
for four to six years, normally structuring its deals as equity and
subsequently putting in follow-on capital.

Publishing partnerships

EMG's publishing division has four separate units - Learning,
Entertainment, Medical & Healthcare, and Lifestyle. It develops CD-ROM
and CD-i titles in association with major international companies, but
retains significant intellectual property rights. Its $3.6m three-year
development funding and publishing deal with Time Warner Interactive
provides EMG with marketing and distribution channels for releases such
as Thumbelina, a children's title based on an animated Warner Bros
feature film by Don Bluth of the Hans Andersen story.

EMG Publishing is involved in three multimedia development operations -
the Spice Factory joint venture with film producers Jason Piette and
Michael Cowen specialising in fantasy/adventure games as well as films
and TV programmes; Eagle Peak, a collaboration with independent
producer New Media Vision specialising in interactive comic books and
encyclopaedias; and children's and educational publisher Labyrinth.

EMG provides all the funding for each of these companies but gives the
individual developers an equity stake in their own venture in addition
to considerable creative independence.

Eagle Peak is developing the Takeru series of CD-ROM titles based on
the highly-popular Japanese-language comic books of the same name.
Labyrinth is working on a number of CD-ROM titles funded by Time Warner
Interactive such as the multimillion pound project Drowned God
(previously given the code name Iron Horse), tipped as TWI's lead for
its Christmas 1996 release schedule.

The Spice Factory is developing a CD-ROM game jointly funded by EMG
Publishing and film company Pachyderm (a subsidiary of Goldcrest Films)
based on the science fiction film Space Truckers. The game is being pre-
sold country by country with the film. Spice Factory is also due to
release its first feature film, The Killer Tongue, this year.

Although 50-60% of EMG's business comes from its long-established
corporate communications work, it sees most of its future growth coming
from consumer multimedia publishing. In addition, EMG has set up a team
to design user interfaces for interactive TV networks such as BT's East
Anglian trial for which EMG also produced National Westminster Bank's
interactive banking interface.

Another significant growth area for EMG is likely to be the Internet.
Just before Christmas, Scotland Online, a joint venture between
Scottish Telecom and cartoon publisher D.C. Thompson, went live with
Web pages designed by EMG Interactive, EMG's corporate communications
division. In addition to the corporate Web site market, EMG sees great
potential for its intellectual properties in consumer Internet
publishing and games-on-demand.

1996 is likely to be an exciting year for EMG's CD-ROM publishing
division, with the launch of the first fruits of its three publishing
joint ventures. In addition, several major new titles are expected by
December which will eventually be available over the Internet, says Jim
Brathwaite. He also promises a deal with an unspecified UK partner to
produce a CD-ROM and hard copy tie-in.

INNER WORKINGS INTERIM SALES AHEAD

Inner Workings plc, the Glasgow-based CD-ROM developer, reported sales
of #186,911 for the six months to 30 September 1995, compared to
#24,142 a year earlier.

The loss on ordinary activities widened to #115,736 from #65,983 last
time, reflecting the company's investment in production facilities and
staff outlined in its prospectus at  its Alternative Investment Market
flotation last August. Inner Workings raised #1m net of costs to fund
expansion through its share placing.

Alistair King of London stockbrokers Charles Stanley predicts that
Inner Workings will become profitable in 1997 and suggests that it
might be acquired by a larger concern interested in its skilled staff.

Last year the company completed the first two titles in a range of four
children's CD-ROMs for Oxford University Press, The Fish Who Could Wish
and A Christmas Story. Eight foreign language versions of these titles
are under active negotiation, with the first of these due for delivery
to the European market by spring 1996. The remaining two OUP children's
titles, Winnie the Witch and Dragons, will be launched in May.

Chairman Lesley Keen says Inner Workings has established the
foundations of an advanced software engineering facility which is
intended to be used to produce the company's own educational and games
software. The first "own brand" title is planned to go into production
in late spring 1996.

The first product in a three-title CD-ROM deal with Reed Consumer Books
is expected to be released for the Christmas 1997 market, says Ms Keen.


Inner Workings is close to signing a co-production deal with a major
global publisher on a children's activity game title for the Christmas
1996 market, and is entering the prototype development phase on a CD-
ROM title for Philips Media for the US market.

APPLE, REPRISE RECORDS IN NEW MEDIA PARTNERSHIP

Apple Computer is to work together with Warner Music label Reprise
Records to promote Reprise artists in tandem with Apple new media
technology and software. The collaboration will include joint
promotions, co-launching products such as enhanced CDs and cross-
promoting Web sites.

Apple is already working with UK-based record company EMI's new
multimedia division to produce enhanced CDs, soundcarriers which can be
played like ordinary audio CDs or run on a CD-ROM drive to view the
text and video they contain. In December Apple and EMI opened the Abbey
Road Interactive multimedia studio in London.

Reprise already has a reputation for innovative use of Apple technology
in its recording studios. Its Web site, which runs on an Apple server
and features e-mail access to artists such as Neil Young, Morrissey and
Enya, receives around 20,000 hits a day. In addition, the label plans
to release its first three enhanced CDs in first quarter 1996.

POLYGRAM ISSUES PROFIT WARNING, BUYS GOLDWYN LIBRARY

PolyGram, the Philips-owned entertainment group, warned last month that
profits for 1995 would be static against 1994, following a poor second
half. In the six months to June 1995, PolyGram, which has achieved a
20% compound annual growth rate in net income since 1990, saw profits
rise 15%.

In 1994 PolyGram recorded pre-tax profits of Fl 1.08bn (#436m) on sales
of Fl 8.6bn. Chairman Alain Levy said the group would return to profit
growth this year, due to an improved album release schedule including
new work from artists such as Sting, U2 and the Cranberries. He blamed
1995's poor performance on a below-par release schedule in the second
half, delays in the delivery of big albums, the lack of a major film
hit and the strength of the guilder.

In a bid to expand its four-year-old film business, PolyGram agreed
last month to buy the film and TV library of The Samuel Goldwyn
Company, the financially troubled US film group, for $62m (#39m) in
cash. Goldwyn, which has been seeking capital to reduce its debts, sold
the rights to 850 feature films including recent productions such as
The Madness of King George and Much Ado About Nothing as well as
several TV series.

The deal follows PolyGram's $156m purchase last January of Los Angeles-
based ITC Entertainment which owns the rights to 350 feature films and
vintage TV series in addition to running a programming distribution
business. Last year PolyGram entered the video CD market with a batch
of releases including its 1994 movie hit Four Weddings and a Funeral
and titles from rock bands such as Wet Wet Wet, Abba and The Who.

For Alain Levy, the key word is "leverage" - squeezing more revenue
from PolyGram's copyright material by leveraging it across multiple
distribution channels. This explains PolyGram's interest in
establishing more TV channels along the lines of its music video
channel collaboration with Viacom subsidiary MTV, a customer for much
of its music. It hopes to sell Goldwyn's film back catalogue as a
package to cable and TV channels with new films from its PolyGram
Filmed Entertainment unit.

However, although Mr Levy has abandoned his initial scepticism about
the information highway and his company is actively setting up
promotional Web sites, he believes that electronic distribution of
music via the Internet will never replace physical retailing. "Buying
music is a social experience, and the packaging of a product is very
important", he says.

ELECTRONIC SHOPPING

According to a report by retail property consultants Healey & Baker,
Where People Shop, by 1997, 5% of all retail spending in England,
Scotland and Wales will be done over the Internet, amounting to over
#7.5bn of business. The report says that a fifth of shoppers are
interested in shopping electronically.

Harmsworth Broadcasting, the multimedia arm of The Daily Mail and
General Trust, has bought British Pathe, owner of the historic Pathe
News archive, for #6m. Harmsworth's chairman Sir David English, who is
also responsible for DGMT's two existing cable TV channels, wants to
use the archive to launch a history channel.

DGMT's Channel One London 24-hours news channel will use the archive to
produce programmes on social history. The archive will also provide
material for a CD-ROM on 20th century history currently being produced
by the Daily Mail.

TOTAL CD-ROM UNIT SALES UP 125% IN 1995

The seventh edition of US consultancy InfoTech's Optical Industry
Publishing Assessment predicts that total 1995 worldwide unit sales of
CD-ROM titles rose by 125% to 206m from 91.8m in 1994. The reports
covers all categories of CD-ROM titles.

Worldwide CD-ROM title revenue rose by only 70% to $18.1bn from
$10.7bn, due to the rapid expansion of the consumer sector where steep
discounting prevails because of intense competition for shelfspace and
widespread bundling.

In 1994, just over 20% of total worldwide CD-ROM revenues were derived
from consumer sales, with the remainder coming from the professional,
corporate and educational markets. The number of consumer CD-ROM titles
in print doubled to over 3,000 in 1994 and is expected to have doubled
again in 1995.

InfoTech predicts that in 1995 the consumer sector grew to 24% of the
total CD-ROM market. Led by strong sales of multimedia home PCs, the
worldwide installed base of CD-ROM drives for both PCs (all platforms)
and TV set-top systems such as CD-i, Sega and 3DO grew to 26.9m in
1994, and is forecast to rise by over 80% to 49.5m in 1995.

In 1995, for the first time, more CD-ROM drives were sold in new PCs
than in multimedia upgrade kits, by a margin of more than 2 to 1.
Preliminary research for 1995 suggests that around 35% of notebooks
sold worldwide were CD-ROM equipped, InfoTech says. By the year 2000,
more than 80% of all desktop PCs will have a CD-ROM drive and at least
50% of all TV set-top systems will have a CD-ROM drive instead of or in
addition to a cartridge player.

APPLE WARNS OF CHRISTMAS QUARTER LOSS

Apple Computer warned that it would post a loss for its first quarter
ending 31 December 1995, stunning analysts who had predicted net
profits for the quarter of around $87m. Apple has traditionally enjoyed
big sales in the run-up to Christmas and in the quarter to December
1994 posted net profits of $188m.

Apple said that an aggressive price-cutting campaign begun in August
had failed to stimulate expected demand for its Macintosh computers in
its key markets of Japan and the US, leaving it with unsold inventory.
Analysts now expect Apple to drastically streamline its operations
through up to 2,000 job losses and speculate that it will seek a merger
partner or put itself up for sale. Speculation centres on IBM, Sony or
Oracle as the most likely buyers. Oracle is believed to have made an
offer for Apple's Newton personal digital assistant unit to support its
own mobile computing ambitions.

In the quarter to 30 September 1995 Apple regained lost market share
and its position as the largest PC manufacturer in the US market.
However, this was due mainly to existing Apple users upgrading their
systems. Apple's latest financial results suggest that it has failed to
persuade new purchasers that the Macintosh is better than its Intel-
Microsoft equivalent.

APPLE'S MARKET SHARE IN GERMANY

Apple had around 4.4% of the German PC market in 1995, according to its
central European general manager Jan Gesmar-Larsen. He aims to sell
250,000 Apple computers in Germany in the fiscal year to 30 September
1996, 7% of the total market.

In the year to 30 September 1995, Apple's central European division
sold 220,000 computers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and eastern
Europe, generating a 21% rise in revenues to $573m. This year it is
looking for revenues of $800m in the region.

APPLE TARGETS 3D GRAPHICS MARKET

Apple hopes to exploit the relative confusion in the Intel-Microsoft
camp with regard to multimedia standards to provide a clear lead in the
low-cost 3D graphics market.

In November Apple launched the QuickDraw 3D graphics accelerator,
which, coupled with its QuickDraw 3D software, is claimed to increase
the speed of 3D rendering by up to 12 times. Plugging into the PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) slot on a Power Macintosh, the
graphics board costs #299.

Apple claims that a high-specification PowerMac equipped with the
QuickDraw board and software offers professional designers and
developers a low-cost alternative to a 3D graphics workstation from
market leader Silicon Graphics.

CIRRUS LOGIC DELAYS OFFERING AFTER PROFIT WARNING

Cirrus Logic, the US audio, video and graphics chip manufacturer, said
last month that it expects earnings of about 13-19 cents a share in its
third quarter to 31 December 1995, well below the consensus forecast of
44 cents. In the quarter to December 1994, Cirrus earned $14.5m net, or
46 cents a share.

Following a sharp drop in its share price in response to the profit
warning, Cirrus said it would delay a planned offering of 6m common
shares and $500m in convertible subordinated notes. It also said it
would reduce fiscal 1997 and 1998 capital expenditure by over $600m,
although it still intends to expand its manufacturing capacity during
1997-1999.

Cirrus has expanded over the last few years due to the growth in demand
for multimedia PCs. In the year to April 1995 it posted net profits of
$61.4m on sales of $889m, compared to net profits of $45.4m on sales of
$557.3m in 1994.

The company said results in the quarter to December had suffered from
softer than anticipated conditions in Taiwan and slower than expected
growth in the home PC market. Sales for the quarter ending March 1996
would depend on the success of several new graphics and audio products,
it added.

In November 1995, Cirrus warned that third quarter revenue growth would
be hit by reductions in orders for its multimedia chips from a major
customer, believed to be Intel. Analysts said Intel had cut its orders
because US computer manufacturer Packard Bell had stocked too many PC
motherboards containing a 32-bit Cirrus chip and had lost sales to 64-
bit versions from rival vendors such as Compaq. Packard Bell has also
suffered from overstocking of 75MHz Pentium-based PCs at a time when
consumers are opting for faster, competitively-priced PCs from other
vendors.

Tom Rigoli, vice president of corporate communications at Cirrus, said
that several customers are now seeking to have their advance chip
orders fulfilled sooner, suggesting a potential recovery in home PC
sales. Nevertheless, several key US analysts lowered their estimates of
Cirrus' earnings in fiscal 1997. Drew Peck of Cowen & Co, for example,
cut his forecast from $2.72 a share to $2.22.

AMSTRAD CUTS BACK CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ARM

Amstrad has announced a restructuring of its lossmaking Ace division
which produces a range of audio, video and satellite TV equipment for
the fiercely competitive consumer electronics market.

The decision to scale back Ace - once the core of Amstrad's empire -
and concentrate on Amstrad's higher-margin activities in direct PC
sales, modems and mobile telephones led to the resignation last month
of chief executive David Rogers, half way through a three-year
contract.

According to the Financial Times, an internal strategy paper was
presented to Amstrad's board last month warning that Ace could not be
revitalised and would not break even in the year to June 1996. In the
year ending 30 June 1995 Amstrad posted a pre-tax profit of #3.06m
after three years of losses and despite continuing losses at Ace
(Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/2/7).

ESCOM HIT BY PC PRICE WAR

Escom, the German PC manufacturer and retailer, says losses in calendar
1995 are expected to reach DM45m (#20.2m), due to the costs of its
rapid European expansion, weak fourth quarter sales and fierce price
cutting in the consumer market.

Sales rose from DM2.15bn in 1994 to only DM2.35bn last year, following
an "unsatisfactory" second half. In 1994 Escom posted profits of
DM11.1m.

Last May Escom bought over 200 Rumbelows stores in the UK, which it
expects to make "a considerable contribution to profits" in 1996.
Escom, which is the second largest PC vendor in Germany behind Vobis,
says it has completed its European expansion programme. It now has 455
European outlets compared to 268 at the end of 1994.

TIMETABLE FOR GERMAN TELECOM BILL AGREED

The German government and the main opposition party, the Social
Democratic Party, have agreed on a firm timetable for legislation to
liberalise the telecom market and end Deutsche Telekom's monopoly by 1
January 1998. A consensus on the main terms of the deregulation bill
had already been reached in November (Multimedia Business Analyst,
2/4/4).

This latest deal is important in ensuring that the legislation passes
both houses of parliament - the lower house (Bundestag) controlled by
the governing Christian Democrat/Free Democrat coalition and the upper
house (Bundesrat) controlled by the Social Democrats. It will go before
the Bonn cabinet on 24 January and parliamentary debate will begin next
month. With all-party consent, the new telecom bill is expected to
become law this summer.

This month, the Finance Ministry will hold a meeting to finally resolve
the political deadlock over the role of the telecom industry regulator
which will need to be set up prior to deregulation. It is thought
likely that the Finance Ministry will be responsible for the
government's stake in Deutsche Telekom after its partial privatisation
in late 1996 through a DM15bn share issue.

The bill will open up the DM75bn German telecom market, the third
largest in the world after the US and Japan, from 1998, while
preventing companies from abusing dominant positions. It will also pave
the way for an influx of investment by international telecom operators
such as BT, AT&T and Cable & Wireless, building on alliances they have
already formed with German companies.

The content of the bill will be largely as agreed by the political
parties in November. As well as paving the way for large operators to
offer nationwide services, the bill foresees a role for smaller and
medium-sized companies providing services. It will allow frequencies to
be made available locally to promote more competition through wireless
links.

The bill will also include an obligation on the government to ensure
the universal provision of affordable, high-standard telephone services
to all users. Telecom Minister Wolfgang Botsch says voice services
should have "advanced digital characteristics", ensuring that any
customer wanting ISDN services can expect to have them.

Providers of universal services - comprising standard home or office
services, pay telephones, directory enquiries and access to emergency
services - will be obliged to keep up with the latest technological
developments.

Indonesia's international telecom operator PT Indosat is planning to
offer cable TV services and has budgeted $11.92m to carry out an
evaluation for a possible entry into the sector, reports Asia-Pacific
Telecoms Analyst.

Indosat is believed to have acquired a small interest in Japanese cable
TV operator Suginami in a move said to be directly linked to plans to
set up a cable TV network in Indonesia this year or in 1997. Indosat
would probably carry out the cable TV project with PT Indocitra
Grahabawana, two of whose controlling shareholders also control one of
Indonesia's five private TV stations, PTR Surya Citra Televisi.

EC PASSES MOBILE TELEPHONE DEREGULATION DIRECTIVE

The EC announced before Christmas that a directive on mobile and
personal telecoms will come into effect from the beginning of January.
The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive and
special rights in the mobile communications sector for monopoly
operators and to establish fair and open licensing procedures.

Operators holding licences for one mobile service will be able to apply
to run all digital mobile services such as GSM, DCS 1800 minicell and
DECT cordless. Member states may not refuse to allocate licences for
public access/Telepoint applications using the DECT short-range system
or, from 1998, licences for mobile systems on the DCS 1800 standard.
Moreover, they may not restrict combinations of mobile technologies.
The directive also gives mobile operators the right to build their own
infrastructure or to make use of alternative telecom infrastructures
run by railways and utilities.

AT&T AND BROADBAND ANNOUNCE LOW-COST ATM BREAKTHROUGH

North Carolina-based BroadBand Technologies and AT&T Microelectronics
have developed a low-cost chipset which they claim will enable
affordable ATM broadband services to be transmitted directly over
ordinary copper telephone wire to homes and businesses.

Kris Nasta, vice president of BroadBand's European operations, says the
chips will deliver the full functionality of fibre-to-the-home networks
but at costs approaching that of a normal telephone service.
The Multipoint Broadband Access (MBA) chipset offers 52Mbps ATM
transmission and incorporates Broadband's switched digital video (SDV)
technology and AT&T's 16-CAP (carrierless amplitude and phase
modulation) encoding and compression system. BroadBand's FLX (FibreLoop
Access) SDV System transmits bi-directional interactive multimedia over
fibre-to-the-curb networks to groups of 20-30 houses via an Optical
Network Unit (ONU). Because of its use of 16-CAP, FLX can carry
analogue cable TV signals as well as interactive services into the home
over the same coax wire using a diplexer.

16-CAP allows the re-use of existing Category 3 unshielded twisted pair
(UTP) copper wiring, the standard for kerbside-to-home installation,
for digital ATM and telephony traffic. It eliminates the need for the
complex modulation schemes, adaptive equalisation, high-frequency
analogue tuning and forward error correction required by competing
encoding/modulation technologies, Mr Nasta says.

The MBA chips are already being implemented as part of planned
deployments of BroadBand's FLX SDV System by France Telecom and of AT&T
Network Systems' SLC-2000 Access with FLX SDV System by Southwestern
Bell and Disney's Celebration Community, a test-bed for interactive
communications being built in Orlando, Florida.

TELECOM COMPETITION SPURS MULTIMEDIA GROWTH

The liberalisation of voice telecommunications across the European
Union from 1998 will lead to the growth of new services, including
multimedia, as operators look for new sources of income, says a report
from Cambridge-based Analysys Publications.

Existing telecom players - cable TV companies, managed network service
providers and telecom operators (TOs) - are all looking to secure
advantage. New players such as rail and power companies, entrants
backed by industrial consortia and start-ups based on advanced
technologies are already breaking into the lucrative ECU129bn telecom
market which is growing at a rate of 7% per annum, says Paul Knott,
author of New Network Operators in Europe.

Many of the new entrants look set to pursue niche market strategies,
targeting their price and new services at particular groups of
customers, in contrast with the broader marketing strategies pursued by
the incumbents, says Mr Knott. As they are not hampered by legacy
infrastructure, new entrants are busy investing in modern network
technologies such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SDH
(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). SDH is a prerequisite for ATM and both
technologies are important in the delivery of multimedia services. The
table on page 9 summarises current and planned deployment of of ATM and
SDH by a range of regional and national licensed TOs, managed network
service providers and infrastructure suppliers.

To date, most new operators are concentrating on building an initial
market position with modern technology, but with a fairly basic range
of services. Unless they choose to compete solely on price, a strategy
at which only one operator can be successful, they will need to develop
new services to maintain their revenues in the longer term.

"While modern technologies can help new players avoid many of the
legacy issues which affect the incumbents, they would be wrong to
assume that it necessarily gives them a competitive advantage", says Mr
Knott. "New operators will have to translate technology capabilities
into end-user services such as LAN interconnection, Internet access,
business video and interactive multimedia services, if they want to
maximise the value of their investment."

Incumbent TOs will need to respond to these attacks across all of their
markets. The report contends that their best strategy for confronting
the new operators may be to force the pace of competition by
aggressively introducing new services. With entrants busy investing in
expanding infrastructure and coverage, incumbents could use their
financial strength to fund the development of a broader range of
intelligent network services, multimedia and personal mobility
functions. However, new entrants or established managed network
services providers will also need to provide intelligent network-based
voice services.

The new entrants' initial infrastructure roll-out provides a ready made
market for new SDH, ATM and fibre optic systems, and the desire to
launch services as quickly as possible after 1998 means that many
operators will want off-the-shelf products. Although new deployment of
broadband infrastructure will provide growth in the short term, the
major opportunity for technology suppliers will be in developing and
enhancing products which support innovative new services.

Investment

Investment by utilities and other industrial companies has been a
feature of new network development, says Mr Knott, with a  third of the
total investment being contributed by them. Surprisingly, the finance
sector has contributed only around 15% of all direct investment,
although this figure excludes loans and other funding arrangements with
the companies making the investment in infrastructure. The chart on
page 10 estimates the spread of sources of finance for new UK
infrastructure covering the period 1991-1996.

A similar range of investors is already evident across the rest of
Europe, although a lack of data makes it impossible to assess the
relative financial contributions of each group. Major groups of
corporate investors include investment banks and similar institutions
(Telenet Vlaanderen, ISIS Multimedia), public and private sector
utilities (Telivo, EnterTel, etc.) and parent industrial companies
(Thyssen Telecom, Tele2, etc.).

North American investment is widespread across Europe. The initial wave
coincided with the licensing of independent mobile network operators.
This was followed by several regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs)
taking stakes in the cable TV sector in France, Spain and Scandinavia,
following their move into the UK cable market.  More recently this has
been followed by a wave of alliances with European partners seeking to
enter voice telephony markets, an example of this being the
collaboration between BellSouth and Thyssen.

STREAM "FLOUTS" ITALIAN CABLE TV RULES

Stream, the multimedia division of Italian state telecom holding
company Stet and its subsidiary Telecom Italia, has announced plans to
provide TV programming services over the broadband fibre-optic network
under construction by Telecom Italia, reports New Media Markets.

However, Stream's plans may be thwarted by the Italian government's
draft cable TV legislation which aims to prevent Telecom Italia
becoming a direct provider of broadcast-type TV services (Multimedia
Business Analyst, 1/23/3 and 2/1/1).

Stream hopes to begin offering a package of TV programming from
September over the hybrid fibre optic/coaxial cable network being
deployed by Telecom Italia. It plans to provide four cable TV channels,
two premium pay-per-view channels and a home shopping service.
Programming will cover films, music, documentaries and sport.
Stream claims to be an independent programming distributor and says
that, although initially it will provide programming over Telecom
Italia's broadband network, it will consider using other operators'
infrastructure - such as Videostrada, the Olivetti-US West joint
venture - when this becomes available. However, analysts are dubious
about the legal validity of Stream's argument, given that it is
assuming responsibility for packaging, pricing and marketing and that
Stream and Telecom Italia are part of the same organisation. Telecom
Italia is seen as trying to get round the proposed ban on its providing
entertainment services by using Stream.

By the autumn, when Stream's programming service will start, Telecom
Italia's broadband network should have reached 14 major cities, with
optical fibre in the trunk network and coaxial fibre running to the
home. By mid-1997 coverage should have been extended to 25-30 cities.
Assuming that optical fibre costs fall sufficiently over the next three
years, Telecom Italia hopes to start laying optical fibre to the home
by the end of 1998. It originally planned to deploy optical fibre to
10m homes by late 1998, but merchant bankers Robert Fleming Securities
says that it will achieve only a third of this number.

Stream launches VOD trial

Stream and Telecom Italia launched a commercial trial of VOD services
at the end of last month to 1,000 homes in Milan and Rome. The
Videomagic service runs over Telecom Italia infrastructure, initially
providing entertainment programmes, children's TV, local information
services and home shopping. Stream plans to launch the service
commercially in early 1997, making it available to Telecom Italia and
other broadband network operators.

Despite Telecom Italia's new policy of only using optical fibre for
multimedia services, Stream is using asymmetric digital subscriber line
(ADSL) technology in the Videomagic trial. Bell Atlantic is providing
equipment for the pilot, which follows a technical trial starting in
December 1994.

ITALIAN BANKS TO INVEST IN MEDIASET

Six Italian banks led by credit institute IMI have agreed to take a
combined 5.49% stake - worth L370bn ($233m) - in Mediaset, the newly-
formed TV and advertising arm of former Italian premier Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest media group. The banks also agreed to help with
the subsequent flotation of part of Mediaset with a preliminary
commitment to underwrite L1,025bn worth of shares.

Mr Berlusconi plans to reduce his family's stake in Mediaset to under
50% through public offerings on the Milan, London and New York stock
exchanges beginning in mid-1996.

State-owned BNL is considering becoming the seventh bank to invest in
Mediaset via its Albacom telecom joint venture with UK carrier BT.
Mediaset is known to be seeking a telecom company as a partner.
However, should BT consent to Albacom making this proposed L70bn
investment, it is unclear how it would affect rival Cable & Wireless
Europe's negotiations to use Fininvest's Italian TV transmission
network for fixed and wireless telecoms (Multimedia Business Analyst,
2/3/3).

A consortium of foreign investors including German media magnate Leo
Kirch, Prince al-Waheed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and a group
controlled by South African financier Johan Rupert already owns around
18% of Mediaset.

TWO WAY TV RAISES FUNDS FOR NATIONAL SERVICE

Two Way TV, the London-based company which launched a terrestrial
interactive TV service in Birmingham in November, is in the process of
raising #30m-#40m in new capital. It hopes to launch throughout the
Central Television area in the Midlands this spring followed by a
nationwide rollout during 1996.

Investors so far include Electra, Mercury Asset Management, Murray
Johnstone and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Multimedia
Business Analyst, 2/3/2). The Two Way TV system broadcasts data and
graphics to accompany TV programmes via spare capacity on conventional
TV frequencies in the same way as teletext. Subscribers receive four
infra-red handsets and a Motorola set-top box equipped with a modem
which communicates their answers to interactive TV quizzes via a free
telephone connection to Two Way TV's server.
Two Way TV has reached agreement with all the UK's broadcasters to use
their programmes and receive copies in advance so that additional game
formats can be added by its staff.

Executive chairman Bill Andrewes, a former chairman of Granada's rental
and leisure divisions, says that initial market research suggests
consumers find the Two Way TV system attractive and that it increases
viewing in homes which subscribe. He is encouraged by the service's 8%
take-up rate in the Birmingham area, particularly as a planned TV
advertising campaign has yet to start.

NTT CLAIMS INFRARED PUBLISHING BREAKTHROUGH

Japanese telecom operator NTT has formed a strategic partnership with
TV Interactive Corp of the US to develop multimedia communications
services using infrared ray technology.

The TVIQ system enables television viewers to access online shopping
and other interactive TV services by touching text and graphics in
printed publications such as home-shopping catalogues, claims its
developer, Silicon Valley-based TV Interactive.

TV screens will display videos and music chosen by the user when a TV
set-top box, containing CD-based information, responds to infrared rays
emitted from chips embedded in the publication. The system is
particularly intended for consumers such as old people or housewives
who are unfamiliar or apprehensive about interactive technology.

NTT and TV Interactive plan to make their infrared technology an
industry standard by presenting it at a US meeting early this year of
IrDa, the infrared standards body. IrDa has recently standardised
infrared technology for short-distance communications between PCs and
peripherals such as printers, but has yet to begin research into
technology for longer-distance communications such as the TVIQ system.

NEW UK ELECTRONIC SHOPPING TRIAL PLANNED

This April sees the launch of Project SUMMON, an electronic shopping
trial involving 40 major UK retailers and service providers and managed
by Rickmansworth-based start-up Virtual Precincts Ltd.

Project SUMMON (Sales Using MultiMedia On Networks) will site a series
of multimedia kiosks in public places in west and north west London
during 1996. Each kiosk will house a virtual shopping mall in which the
trial participants will offer their wares for purchase by credit or
debit card. Around 100,000 members of the public are expected to use
the system during the lifetime of the trial.

Virtual Precincts' managing director Alan Leibert says that the mall is
not a 100% replica of a standard high street in order to reflect the
participation of mail order and direct-to-market companies as well as
local authorities.

London-based cable TV operator Videotron is supplying the 10Mbps
connections linking the kiosks to SUMMON's server. Data is delivered in
real-time from the central database, allowing the system to be used to
sell cinema, theatre and travel tickets. Towards the end of 1996,
Virtual Precincts intends to offer SUMMON over coax cable TV links to
set-top boxes in subscribers' homes, and is currently talking to a
number of possible equipment suppliers such as games console
manufacturers.

Mr Leibert says that unlike Cambridge Cable and BT's trials of
interactive TV-based shopping, SUMMON is based on open standards,
allowing participating retailers to reuse their "shops" on other
interactive systems. SUMMON's use of the Internet's TCP/IP protocol and
HTML language also means that, once sufficient bandwidth becomes
available, the service could be offered over the Internet, says Mr
Leibert.

Illustra, the US software company taken over by database giant Informix
just before Christmas, is supplying the multimedia relational database
technology for SUMMON. As the Illustra system is based on independent
data types, it is able to assemble HTML pages of information requested
by users "on the fly", says Mr Leibert.

Cambridge-based smart card specialist General Information Systems is
providing the secure payment environment, based on a secure "pipe"
running from each kiosk to a payment server sited alongside the main
server but in a physically secure area. The payment server is connected
to the acquirer and authorisation networks operated by the various card
companies participating in the trial. Once a purchase transaction is
completed, the kiosk prints a receipt for the customer.

Suppliers participating in the project can either set up electronic
links to their own fulfilment systems or take advantage of SUMMON's
fulfilment service.

Other technology companies involved in SUMMON include Glenlake which
designed the virtual mall environment; Point 4 Consulting which
supplied the Access/Register system to track activity at the kiosks;
ICL's kiosk manufacturing unit; and Silicon Graphics which supplied the
central server.

Mr Leibert, a veteran of the smart card industry, says that Virtual
Precincts has decided not to seek finance from the City because of the
short-term approach taken by many investors. Instead, it is seeking
long-term backing, possibly from an international network operator or
from one of its technology partners.

EUROPEAN TELCOS AND UNIVERSITIES LAUNCH AMUSE

A consortium of four universities and 18 telecom operators, equipment
and content vendors including Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia,
Siemens, GPT, Videotime and Online Media has launched a project to
carry out trials of residential digital multimedia services at sites
across Europe. These comprise Milan, Munich, Mons (Belgium), Cambridge,
Aveiro (Portugal), Iceland and Basel (Switzerland).

The AMUSE (Advanced Multimedia Services for Residential Users) project
is under the banner of the ACTS Programme, part of the EC's Fourth
Framework R&D initiative. Each organisation will contribute its own
expertise to the project which will embrace all aspects of multimedia
delivery including set-top boxes, video servers, ATM switches, core and
access networks as well as content creation and service provision.

In addition to testing alternative access network technologies such as
hybrid-fibre-coax (HFC), passive optical networks (PON) and asymmetric
digital subscriber line (ADSL), AMUSE will examine the possibility of
delivering interactive services via broadband ISDN. It will also look
at issues such as delivery platform interoperability and user interface
design.

AMUSE's first phase will provide services such as video- and news-on-
demand, tele-travel agency and Internet access, followed by additional
services in its second phase such as home shopping and tele-games.
Prior to the start of the second phase, the performance of the delivery
platform will be upgraded to improve the picture quality of material
displayed on users' TV screens.

OECD CONFERENCE SEEKS ENCRYPTION COMPROMISE

International business and government representatives meeting in Paris
on 20 December reached a compromise which may lead to formal global
policy guidelines on the encryption of online networks being prepared
by the summer.

The meeting discussed the conditions under which governments seeking to
track illicit activity should be empowered to decode encrypted computer
transmissions, an issue of major concern to private and business
computer users and law enforcement agencies.

Although it had no formal legal authority, the forum, sponsored by the
International Chamber of Commerce and the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development, marked the first occasion that a large
number of delegates from governments, businesses and the IT industry
have gathered to discuss developments in encryption.

The forum agreed that controls should be kept to a minimum, consistent
with the requirements of law enforcement and national security. The
next step will be for governments to formulate guidelines for national
policies with a further joint business-governmental session to provide
private sector input scheduled for the first half of 1996.

The development of a global electronic commerce market on the Internet
potentially worth over $300bn has led to calls from computer companies
such as Microsoft and banks for the US government's strict controls
over the export of encryption algorithms to be relaxed.

Currently, only businesses based in the US have access to high-level
(128-bit) versions of Internet encryption software from companies such
as Netscape and Microsoft (Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/1/9-10). The
universal nature of the Internet means that any encryption software
governed by export regulations cannot legally be distributed online as
it risks being downloaded by users outside the US.

Law enforcement agencies are concerned that if highly secure encryption
technology is exported, it may fall into the hands of money launderers,
drug dealers and terrorists. They have therefore demanded the right to
hack into computer transmissions for counter-intelligence and criminal
investigation work in the same way that they are already able to tap
telephone conversations.

A significant feature of the Paris meeting was that business delegates
agreed in principle to allow such official access to take place as long
as sufficient safeguards are in place and "electronic search warrants"
are issued under due legal process. A number of governments appear
willing to permit relaxation of export controls on high-level
encryption devices as long as these safeguards are in place.

Among the issues which experts on both sides need to resolve are the
ways in which private software "keys" allowing computer transmissions
to be decoded would be handled. The US government's proposed solution -
the Clipper chip which would give its agencies "backdoor" access to
private keys while unauthorised keys would be outlawed - has been hotly
contested by both US computer users and industry players such as Apple,
AT&T, IBM and Microsoft.

The Council of Europe's similar proposal, dubbed Euro-Clipper, has been
rejected by major commercial users, such as investment bank J.P.
Morgan, which said they would take legal action against any move to
force them to use only approved encryption technologies.

However, a number of business organisations have backed the European
Commission's proposal to license trusted third-party escrow
organisations, which would be independent of government, would hold the
keys and would hand them over to government investigators when their
demands were justified. These could be telecom operators, postal
authorities or financial organisations with transaction expertise.

According to CommunicationsWeek International, the EC expects to adopt
a directive backing the use of trusted third parties for encryption in
the first quarter of 1996.

However, a number of critical issues need to be resolved such as how
such custodians could be made legally liable for any unauthorised
access to encrypted information and for the costs of its misuse. In the
hands of a totalitarian government, the legal power to hack into online
networks or to read encrypted data contained on computers or smart
cards could have very serious consequences.

Analysts warn that if governments do not ensure secure communications
in their countries and reasonable safeguards against unjustifed
official intrusion, international companies are likely to transfer
their operations elsewhere.

Moreover, a global solution to encryption is seen as essential.
Businesses view the prospect of a patchwork of different national legal
regimes governing encryption as highly undesirable, as this would
severely delay the advance of international electronic commerce over
the Internet.

NTT DEVELOPS SECURE E-CASH SYSTEM

NTT has developed a secure electronic cash system for smart cards and
Internet-based transactions, reports Reuter. Using very secure
encryption algorithms, the system allows users to transfer cash from
their bank accounts to smart cards after verification by the issuing
bank.

NTT researcher Mikio Suzuki said the Japanese telecom operator plans to
begin trials of the system with a number of major city banks in the
near future. These are expected to include Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank.

SEGA AND NISSHO IWAI ANNOUNCE ONLINE GAMES VENTURE

Video game console manufacturer Sega Enterprises and trading firm
Nissho Iwai Corp are to jointly launch an online video game service in
Japan this April. The service will allow users in different locations
to play the same game against each other using Sega's 32-bit consoles.

Sega will supply the game software, while Nissho will set up a host
computer and provide subscribers with modems. Last month, Nissho set up
a joint venture together with NTT and three other Japanese companies to
market modems for the new service. These will be sourced from US-based
Catapult Entertainment Inc, in which Nissho owns a small equity stake.
A spokesman said Nissho expects to sell 500,000 modems in Japan by the
end of 1996.

COMPUSERVE SUSPENDS ACCESS TO INTERNET NEWSGROUPS

CompuServe has temporarily suspended access to over 200 Internet
newsgroups following a threat of legal action by the German authorities
over illegal pornographic material available on some of the user
forums.

The move follows a raid on CompuServe's German offices during which
federal investigators examined computer equipment. It is believed to be
the first time an online service provider has restricted access to
newsgroups in response to threatened legal action.

A CompuServe spokesman said that the online service provider, which now
has 4m subscribers worldwide including 500,000 in Europe, has to comply
with the laws of the countries in which it operates. "However, laws in
different countries are often in conflict, and this creates challenges
unique to the online industry." CompuServe is now investigating ways in
which it can restrict user access to specific newsgroups by
geographical location, a capability which, like other service
providers, it currently lacks.

As an Internet access provider, CompuServe is not responsible for the
origination or nature of content on the Internet over which it has no
creative or editorial control, the spokesman stressed. Nevertheless,
its move to block access to certain newsgroups won it plaudits from
users, pressure groups and legislators concerned about the largely
unregulated content available on the Internet.

QUOTES FROM THE WAY AHEAD BY BILL GATES (VIKING)

* The benefits and problems arising from this upcoming communications
revolution will be much greater than those brought about by the PC
revolution.

* The information highway will extend the electronic marketplace and
make it the ultimate go-between, the universal middleman....This will
carry us into a new world of low-friction, low overhead, in which
market information will be plentiful and transaction costs low.  It
will be a shopper's heaven.

* Microsoft is investing more than $100m a year on research and
development for the highway.  It will almost certainly take five years
or more of this kind of investing before the results of the R&D bring
in enough revenue to make the money back, so we're making a $500m bet.
It could prove to be a half-billion dollar losing bet.

* The experience of poker strategising - and the money - were helpful
when I got into business....

* The building of the highway will be a learning process, and some
companies will lose their shirts....Gold rushes tend to encourage
impetuous investments.  A few will pay off, but when the frenzy is
behind us, we will look back incredulously at the wreckage of failed
ventures and wonder, "who funded those companies?  What was going on in
their minds?  Was that just mania at work?"

* Beware!  Mergers that are attempts to bring all aspects of highway
expertise into one organisation should be viewed
skeptically....Companies merging, or failing to merge, is no indication
of progress or the lack of it.

* Success is a lousy teacher.  It seduces smart people into thinking
they can't lose.  And it's an unreliable guide to the future.

* I used to date a woman who lived in a different city.  We spent a lot
of time together on e-mail....In the future this sort of "virtual
dating" could be better because the movie watching could be combined
with videoconferencing.

* First thing, as you come in(to my house), you'll be presented with an
electronic pin to clip to your clothes.  The electronic pin you wear
will tell the house who and where you are....Someday, instead of
needing the pin, it might be possible to have a camera system with
visual-recognition capabilities....The house will remember everything
it learns about your preferences.

* Some governments may insist that each (safe and encrypted) mailbox
have a second door with a separate key that the government keeps, but
we'll ignore that political consideration for now and concentrate on
the security that software will provide.

* What today seems like big brother might one day become the norm if
the alternative is being left to the mercy of terrorists and criminals.
 I am not advocating either position - technology will enable society
to make a political decision.

EUROPE ONLINE TO OFFER ACCESS TO T-ONLINE USERS

Europe Online finally launched its multilingual online service on 15
December, although teething problems meant potential subscribers had to
wait to this month for full access. In November it jettisoned AT&T's
proprietary Interchange platform in favour of open Internet standards
and Netscape Navigator.

The Luxembourg-based venture also announced a tie-up with Deutsche
Telekom which will provide the 1m subscribers to the telco's T-Online
German-language online service with "easy" access to Europe Online. T-
Online users subscribing to Europe Online will be also billed by
Deutsche Telekom.

Subject to approval by the EC and by Germany's cartel office, Deutsche
Telekom also plans to invest in the rival online service launched in
late November by America Online and Bertelsmann (Multimedia Business
Analyst, 2/5/3). By allying itself with Europe Online in addition to
AOL/Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom hopes to fend off any anti-trust
investigations.

GLOBAL MULTI-MEDIA INVESTMENT TRUST

London stockbrokers Raphael Zorn Hemsley in partnership with media
consultant John Scaife has announced a media fund investing exclusively
in film, TV, print publishing and multimedia stocks. First Media
Investment Trust plc will focus on companies creating, owning,
distributing or exploiting media assets and intellectual property. It
will however not invest in hardware companies or directly in media
titles. According to NatWest Securities, media stocks have been the
third-fastest-growing sector of the UK stock market since 1973.

To be floated on the Stock Exchange at the end of January, First Media
aims to place between 40m and 100m #1 ordinary shares, with warrants
attached, which will be used to buy stakes in quoted and unquoted media
companies around the world. Mr Scaife, a former head of the European
media and telecom team at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, expects
the trust to raise more than #50m at flotation, given the commitments
he has already received from a number of institutional investors. The
UK already has another specialist media investment trust, Herald
Investment Trust plc. Set up two years ago by Rutherford Asset
Management to handle smaller quoted companies with market
capitalisations under #300m, Herald raised #65m at flotation from 120
institutional investors (Multimedia Business Analyst, 1/14/12-13).
First Media, by contrast, is seeking to invest 30% of its assets in
unquoted companies within a two-year period. It is targeting
institutional investors, although small investors will be able to own
shares at the outset.

Initially, 40% of First Media's portfolio will be in the US, with the
remainder spread throughout Europe, although it may expand into
emerging markets. It will invest 35% of its portfolio in computer games
and interactive multimedia stocks; 25% in cable and broadcast TV
companies including listed conglomerates such as Viacom and Pearson;
15% in film and TV producers; 10% in multimedia publishing support
services such as 3D graphics; 5% in book and print publishing,
particularly with CD-ROM tie-ups; and 10% in Internet companies,
expected to be the growth stocks of the next century.

The initial net asset value of the trust will be 97% of net proceeds. A
1.5% annual management fee will apply, plus a 0.5% premium on dealings
in unquoted stocks. For details, contact Michael Rosenberg on +44
(0)171 628 4000.
