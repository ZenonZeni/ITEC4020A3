<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Energy Management Controller<p>
Performing Organization:  Delco Electronics </B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Dr. Larry Wnuk, (310) 517-5748</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>Delco Electronics, based in Torrance California, will develop and Energy Management Controller (EMC) for electric and hybrid electric vehicles (E/HEV) including buses.  The overall goal of the effort is to significantly increase the efficiency of energy use in an E/HEV through system level control.  The EMC will perform as a system controller, able to monitor status signals and provide control signals to E/HEV subsystems such as auxiliary power unit (APU), battery pack monitor/battery management devices, traction motor controller and drive unit, high and low voltage distribution boxes as well as chargeport.  Performance gains and efficiency gains are expected from improved control of power sources and loads.  Improved control is expected to reduce stresses on the battery resulting in extended cycle life and lower operating costs.  Ultimately,  the development and implementation of algorithms is expected to reduce net emissions for HEVs through improved control of the APU.</P>
	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>By mid-1996, Delco Electronics will design the prototype energy management controller.  By year's end, Delco Electronics will test the controller on a CALSTART hybrid electric bus.</P>
