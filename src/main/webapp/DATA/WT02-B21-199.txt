<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>Jury were race biased,low education level.
<LI>The issues were more fame and wealth than race or justice
<LI>  
<LI>The trial was a joke and has exposed the gaping holes in the American Legal System.
<LI>I THINK (I'm not pointing any fingers) that the jury was paid off. Even if they hadn't been, the fact that OJ is black would have led them to a verdict of "not guilty" anyway.
<LI>I still have a hard time believing that this media circus pushed real news right out of the way.
<LI>Reasonable doubt was why O.J. was found not guilty
<LI>Waste of money and time.
<LI>Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy freedom
<LI> there was never sufficient evidence to arrest oj the entire episode was a slap in the face of the american people
<LI>Trail went to long, maybe the taxpayers of California can sue the Lawyers for misue of taxpayers funds.
<LI>I stopped even caring after the first month
<LI>O.J. COULD HAVE WON WITH A PUBLIC DEFENDER, BLACK BIAS
<LI>GUILTY!  GUILTY!  GUILTY!
<LI>I cried with Mr. Goldman and felt shocked upon hearing the final verdict.
<LI>I think O.J. should rott in hell with barry schef
<LI>The greatest travesty of justice ever perpetrated
<LI>It took too damn long!
<LI>The outcome of this trial was predictable.  I believe O.J. probably did kill Nicole, but there wasn't enough hard evidence to convict him, and what evidence there was seemed at lest partially tainted and/or planted, which is what really blew the prosecution's case in my opinion.
<LI>Jury system = a failure: Go to a system w a panel of judges
<LI>THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OJ DID IT, OR THAT THE JURY AQUITTED BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK
<LI>I probably would have voted not guilty as a juror because I think the LAPD broke the chain of evidence in many places. Shredded it would be a better way of putting it. I suspect OJ did the murders, but the LAPD's evidence is suspect enough to make me doub
<LI>GIVE AN OSCAR TO OJ AND SEND HIM TO BOSNIA!
<LI>This case was too hyped up by the media
<LI>The Justice Department should take special emphasis on jury selection: that is, a jury that will serve the interest of the nation as a whole, not for a particular group of people or race.
<LI>I use to think that native American Indians were the most useless race on the planet, but after seeing OJ and Cockrane sniveling all the time, I must say that the niggers are sure giving them a 'race' for their money.
<LI>If you saw and heard it all, you had to go along w/ jury.
<LI>The murders were crimes of passion and should have been prosecuted as such!
<LI>It saddened me deeply that the women jurors thought of themselves first as black and second as women, rather than first as women.
<LI>I think the people who say OJ is guilty are crazy
<LI>OJ is a dirty bastard who will rot in hell
<LI>No one saw O.J Simpson kill Nicole Brown or Ron Goldman and though alot of evidence pointed towards O.J. Simpson the jury found him innocent because the prosecution did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.  I am not saying that O.J Simpson is guity or innocent because none of us was there to see it.  The only people that do know is Ron, Nicole,O.J and God!  O.J wasn't even caught on video camera and the whole world assumes that he is guity but when those police officers beat Rodney King's as
 and the whole world was there to see it they still got off, so I don't want to hear about justice not being served in the O.J trial because justice wasn't served in other areas and I didn't see the world go into convulsions on the verdict of those police officers.
<LI>it sucked 
<LI>I WONDER IF THE TRIAL AFFECTED O.J.'S GOLF GAME.
<LI>The case just proved that the so-called Justice System is broken and all stupid "victims's Rights" laws shoud be removed from the books.  Buy a weapon and get training and to hell with the justice system.
<LI>He did and got away with it and is laughing his ass off now...
<LI>He did and got away with it and is laughing his ass off now...
<LI>very frustrating verdict
<LI>TO ALL OF THE WHITE PEOPLE WHO HAVE  MADE EXTREMELY RACIST REMARKS, I REALLY PITTY YOU.  YOU ACCUSE US OF WRONGFULLY CRYING "RACISM" EVERY TIME SOMETHING GOES WRONGE, YET YOU SIT BACK AND  CALL US NIGGERS AND  PEICES  OF SHIT AND EXPECT US NOT  TO  THINK  THAT YOU FEEL HATRED  TOWARDS US?   YOU EXPECT US  NOT  TO BE DEFENSIVE?   FACE IT, YOU ARE THE ONESWHO ARE  UNEDUCATED IF YOU THINK THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY ONES COMMITTING CRIMES IN YOUR COUNTRY!   IN THE WORST PARTS OF THE U.S,  (where all of
this  black violenc is comming from)  WHO  DO YOU THINK BUILT A LIQUIR  STORE ON EVERY CORNER?  AND ALL THE GUN SHOPS?  THAT WAS YOU.   HOPING WE WOULD DESTROY OURSELVES.  IT'S  WORKING TOO, BUT BOY DO YOU GET PERTERBED WHEN A BLACK IS SUCCESSFUL, RICH, AND INTELLIGENT!  IF WE'RE SUCH A PROBLEM FOR YOU THEN I'M GLAD, IT WAS YOU WHO  BROUGHT  US HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO GET USED TO IT CAUSE IT'S  TOO  LATE TO TAKE US BACK NOW!!
<LI>It's a sad commentary on both the media and the U.S. public, that this this trial received so much attentioon.   /
<LI>the only race lines were those that the media created.
<LI>Unfortuntely reading from the internet, alot of white americans still do not understand how it is to be a black human being.  We are still treated unfairly through the justice system, why? Economics. White americans do not get pulled over for no reason. White americans do not get beat up by the police as much as miniorities and obviously alot of you still think O.J. is guilty, get a grip! Leave the man alone. The only fault I have against him is beating Nicole! and trust me I as an African female can r
late.
<LI>The jury did not have access to all info the public did so you can't say why they ruled the way they did.  From what I saw (which wasn't everything by a long shot) I was under the impression OJ did it.  There was some doubt but then what is "reasonable" doubt.
<LI>He should have fried.
<LI>Short-term victory.  Eternity in hell for other reasons probably awaits O.J.
<LI>Not Guilty verdict was just showing black power, like getting even with people like Mark Furhman instead of thinking of the mudered victims.
<LI>It was a huge waste of time and iI don't really care what the verdict is/was etc.
<LI>Blacks deserve whatever they get in their neighborhoods
<LI>The lawyers should be taken out into the street and executed!
<LI>I THINK THE VERDICT WAS GREAT!  WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF IS ALL THE RACIST COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN ON HERE.  WE'RE NOT ADULTS BUT WE THINK SOME OF THE ADULTS OUT THERE WHO ARE WRITING ALL THOSE RACIST COMMENTS SHOULD LOOK AT YOUR OWN LIFE BEFORE YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLES AND JUDGE THEM UPON THEIR RACE.  IT'S NOT FAIR IF YOU DO NOT KNOW EVERY SINGLE PERSON PERSONALLY FROM EVERY DIFFERENT RACE; TO JUDGE THEM.  I THINK SOME OF YOU SHOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR ONCE AND A WHILE AND SEE IF YOU LIKE I
.  IF SOME OF THE AUTHORS OF THOSE RACIST COMMENTS LIKE WHAT THEY SEE IN THE MIRROR AND LIKE WHO THEY ARE THIS WORLD IS GETTING SADDER BY THE SECOND AND ALL THE RACISTS OUT THERE AREN'T HELPING TO MAKE THIS WORLD ANY BETTER.  SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ALL THE CRIMES, EVERY CRIME IS COMITTED BY A VARITEY OF DIFFERENT RACES AND RELIGIONS.  BLAMING ANOTHER RACE IS JUST TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT AND BEING A COWARD.  WE CAN'T SURVIVE IN A WORLD LIKE THIS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM NOW !  
 THINK O.J IS NOT GUILTY BASED UPON ALL THE EVIDENCE(((( THE REAL EVIDENCE NOT RACE)))) THAT IS OUR OPINION IT'S NOT YOUR'S AND YOU ARE INTITLED TO YOUR OWN OPINION.  EXCEPT IT'S PRETTY SAD IF IT'S BASED ON RACE.  THIS IS FROM TWO FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CANADIAN GIRLS WHO WERE APALLED BY THE RACIST COMMENTS THAT ARE PRETTY FREAKY IF YOU ASK US!   
<LI>Is Mark Furhman single 'cause I want him baaaaaaaaaaad !!!!
<LI>The trial as a whole was a big joke.  Justice was not served in the courts, but it will be served when God gets his chance to deal with OJ.
<LI>I have lost my faith in all humanity.  OJ did it!!  The verdict was sickening!!!!!!!!!
<LI>We have finally achieved true equality in this nation -- if you're rich you can get off regardless of your race
<LI>OVER KILL
<LI>if you have money you can get awat withmurder!
<LI>So OJ's actually going to sit down for a no-holds bar interview eh? Why bother? He's only going to lie his black ass off (how un-like a negro). He's obviously doing this in a desperate attempt to gain sympathy before the Civil Suit goes to trial. I think he knows that this jury will probably find him GUILTY (which we all know he is) and he's simply getting desperate. And so he should be. He's not going to have that mother fucker Cockrane on his team this time, whining about racism. This time, he HAS to
answer some questions that were nicely avoided at the criminal trial. Like why he fled, why he a a disguise, cash and his passport with him, why he has no alibi, why he refused to take a lie detector test, and why he never took the stand in his own defense. I hope the Goldmans and the Browns sue his ass off and leave him pennyless...that way he can live in the gutter, which is where he belongs.
<LI>A real circus!
<LI>I'm waiting for LA to fall off into the ocean. I will neither go there or do business there.
<LI>It's sad that the issue became racial
<LI>if O.J's wife was black, the media would not have made an issue about the situation.
<LI>If Charles Manson had Cochran as his lawyer, he walks.
<LI>Too much Media Coverage
<LI>It's not that OJ didn't do it, but that the evidence presented at the trial was so badly handled that it couldn't be PROVED that he did it. Race politics aside, the jury was only doing what juries are supposed to do, look for "reasonable doubt."
<LI>Who else would have had a motive to kill them? OJ was so jealous that Nicole was dating someone else, he went psycho and killed them.  Plus, he beat Nicole even while they were married. What kind of loving husband would do that?  OJ MURDERED BOTH OF THEM. HE IS GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>As a Canadian, I releaze Canadian has a better legal system!
<LI>Sad example of how American "justice" works
<LI>Jury sysyem must be changed.
<LI>MARK FURHMAN:SAD EXCUSE FOR A POLICE OFFICER!!!!!!!.
<LI>O.J. Rules and he is innocent
<LI>Are you kidding me?  He is so guilty.  This could be the worst case of misjustice in the history of the world.
<LI>A black jury acquited a black criminal, What else is new?
<LI>It's digusting that a brutal murderer was set free.  
<LI>The DA's Office and the LAPD blew it!  OJ was guilty.  Defense was sleazy enough to place resonable doubt, but jury was affected by race and punished the LAPD and DA instead of OJ
<LI>This trial represented a deeper rooted problem that we have in our society, and that's the status in which we give the rich and famous in our society.  People keep saying, "If OJ was a normal black or white man, he would be on deathrow."  Of course he would.  We as a society are just as guilty because we act as if these people are saints, when in fact they are some the most disfunctional people in the world.  When OJ was abusing Nicole, and she tried to get help, I'm sure that friends, family members,a
d even clergy advised her to somehow try to make the relationship work.  People probably thought, "Oh that nice, charismatic man, and ex-professional football star can't possibly be abusing his wife."  America depicts people like OJ to be perfect and flawless, when in fact we don't know these people at all.  For those of you who were left with hate and bitterness because of this trial, try to bring about some sort of peace, but don't condemn others for their views, as this is America.  Isn't it supposed to
work for everyone?
<LI>O J was proven not-guilty by the court of law, and still this.  Tell me, if a whiteman was to be on trial for the killing of his wife and another man, where would all the hype be?  Everyday, ever before O J, rich whitemen buy the best defense team their money can afford them.  And they walk free; everyday.  It is kinda funny that a blackman, in this time, can now do the same thing(Ha, Ha!).  Also, there's a general opinion(among whitepeople) that blacks are violent.  Hhaa!  the African race is thee mos
 humanistic living beings on this planet.  Look back, thoughout history death and destruction has been from the hands of whitemen.  If O J did do it, think about where he got the idea from?  Last, if you call us niggers, your holding all the race-cards; and their JOKERS!!!
<LI>White America just can't believe that a black man could get off with killing two white people.  If the two people were black, it wouldn't even have made the news.  All of a sudden when white's don't get their way, the judicial system needs to be reformed, or they have lost their belief in the system.  Wake Up America and realize how deeply ingrained your racism is!
<LI>The only reason he wasnt found guilty is because he had money and he was black. If it had been a poor man that would be all it would take.

<LI>OJ's son did it - OJ helped and took the heat because of his status in the community and because of race.
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin!!
<LI>Fine example of what is wrong with the current "need no warent" system we have today.
<LI>What a grievous shame it was.
<LI>Why isn't there an appeal by the prosecution? Jury selection needs to be re-defined.
<LI>Cartesian doubt is not reasonable doubt.
<LI>The prosecution did what was expected of them, a not guilty verdict.
<LI>Very Very sad at the outcome, guilty man went free!!!
<LI>The jury did their job.  I wish people would stop this notion of how the jury did something wrong.  The make up of the jury by race had nothing to do with it.  I sincerely believe that if the jury had been all white, the verdict would have come out exactl
<LI>Johnny Cochran served no purpose other than to re-enforce the beliefs of Louis FaraKKKahn and other racist black "leaders" that every woe any black ever had was the result of a white man's racism
<LI>It is pretty sad that people automatically thought that OJ was guilty. There was an illigel search of his homestead which certainly doesn't make me feel very secure as a US citizen.  Amazing.  The general public spends all of there time cluck-clucking about how a murderer got off and they don't even realize what is happening to the justice system, as far as our rights as citizens.  They don't even give it a second thought.  They just obediently believe whatever is in the press and whatever the family o
 the victims say in their grief.  Scary stuff.  The police are scary, the media is scary, and the public in general are scary.
<LI>Garcetti and Clark are total failures.
<LI>It proved that if you're rich, you can get away with anything.
<LI>If it doesn't fit you must acquit!
<LI>He is guilty
<LI>The whole thing was a gisgus
<LI>when prosecuters present evidence and testimony from police officers prone to lying under oath, and later they are found to have perjured themselves then the public has to realize that the prosecutions whole case has to be tainted!!!!!!!......period
<LI>It was foolish for the media to add so many false facts about this case.
<LI>TO BE GUILTY,JOIN THE LA PD
<LI>IT SUCKED
<LI>in short, it was a long, meaningless case that could have been handled better.
<LI>I will protest any profit OJ attempts to make from this!!!
<LI>Guilty as home made sin. With this jury it was lost from day one.
<LI>What a farce--it seems Nicole's worst fears came true
<LI>The whole trial was simply a horrible thing.
<LI>THERE WAS SO MUCH EVIDENCE THE JURY MUST BE BLIND
<LI>Man what's wrong with you people! OJ IS GUILTY.  You know it I don't know why people have to think he's innocent just because he was a football player.  He didn't give you anything except entertainment.  He really doesnt even give a shit about you!  And for Johnny Chacran he can stick his deck of race cards up his butt.  I think if he wouldn't have kept dealing the 'race card' the outcome of the trail would have been different.  That really sucks, just because a man is black like you then he's automati
ally innocent.  If he was whit and more than half of of the Jury was white and he got off then the black people would have shouted racisim.  You know it!  I give credit to the prosecution for doing a fine job.  OJ knows he is guilty! He knew it the day of the verdict! So did Johnny Chocrane!  Please these people that think Oj is innocent are due for a reality check!  LOOK AT THE EVIdENCE!  who else would have the motive to kill them?  Drug dealers? YEAH RIGHT!!
<LI>THE DEFENCE WAS ABLE TO GET THIER JURY SEATED AND THAT WAS THE END OF JUSTICE.IF YOU SEAT UNEDUCATED PEOPLE TO HEAR HIGHLY TECHNICAL EVIDENCE YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO GRASP WHAT IS PRESENTED.THE PROSECTION FAILED IN NOT CHALLENGING JUROR'S WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE.IT'S AS IF IN ORDER NOT TO APPEAR TO PLAY THE RACE CARD AND EXECPT ANY JUROR THEY DID'NT UNDERSTAND THIER OWN CASE.
<LI>A travesty of justice.
<LI>Fuck the defence and OJ!
<LI>THe trial was OK, but the verdict SUCKED!
<LI>How could anyone not watch it--it's entertainment
<LI>in our legal system, the issue is not guilty or innocent. It is who presented the better case. In this particular trial, it was definately the defense. Wether or not OJ committed the murders is between OJ and God
<LI>goes to show that money can get you ANYWHERE
<LI>This was the blggest bull-shit trial of the century.  The jury cared about one thing, and that was that a black man was on trial.  There was no true interest in justice. 
<LI>OJ's a lyin' sack of brown nigger shit. So is Johnnie Cockrane. They better both be lookin' over their shoulders the rest of their lives...cause someone's gonna get them.
<LI>The Verdict demonstates an additude of blacks towards whites
<LI>Too much of the evidence was deamed inadmissable. Hang OJ
<LI>verdict says nothing about sexual harassment
<LI>if you didn't watch,then your opinion doesn't count!
<LI>This was the biggest obstruction of justice that has ever been seen.  OJ is as guilty as he is alive and black people today are living in a fantasy land to think that he did not do it and that the LAPD set him up.  That's rediculous!
<LI>OJ did it but it doesn't matter if he's convicted because he won't do it again.
<LI>nooooooooooooooo
<LI>I think OJ had something to do with the murders but he didnt do the actual murders.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>What a load of shit!!! So, how's OJ's 'investigation' going? Has he lifted a finger to "find the real killers"?  Actually, all he'd have to do is look in the mirror and he'd see the fucking killer. I'm so sick of the blacks screaming "racism" every time a black person is arrested by a white cop. Have they stopped to think that maybe if they didn't commit the fucking crime, they WOULDN'T get arrested? The negro race has turned out to be completely useless. I also have a comment for the gentleman who cla
med that the African Negro has contributed nothing to our Society. That's not true. Because of them we have more welfare, more prisons, more lawyers, more drug dealers, more law-enformcent officers, and last but not least, more GUNS. What is really ironic, is that it's only the uneducated black who supports OJ. Why they support a guy who has done less that NOTHING for them (he only hangs around white people and only dates white women)is beyond normal thinking. OJ doesn't give a shit about you!!!
<LI>this case added to my distrust of law enforcement officials
<LI>longest trial
<LI>The trial shiuld not have been about race or celebrity 
<LI>it was big waste of time
<LI>If You have enough money you can buy justice in this country!
<LI>Justice was served. Yeah right! Pigs can fly out my ass too!
<LI>He is fucking guilty
<LI>the trial was sorry
<LI>There were too many cracks in the case to convict, but there will always be that nagging feeling that he did do it!
<LI>Money talks & justice walks.  The one who has the gold, makes the rules
<LI>I think the defense was the sleaziest bunch of lawyers I have ever seen.  NOT A GREAT JOB!! They are a disgrace to the legal system in this country... or perhaps it shows what a disgrace the legal sustem in this country is!
<LI>IT SUCKED! DOWN WITH COURT-TV!!
<LI>Personally I believe O.J. did it, but his defense team did their job by showing a reasonable doubt...I often wonder why O.J. has been so subdued since his acquital.  One would think he would be mad and hell about spending so much time behind bars for a crime he says he didn't commit.  So far he hasn't let out so much as a whimper.  What happended to the "bag" taken away by his lawyer friend?  Where was O.J. for the unaccountable hours?  Why did he have large amouts of cash, checks, a passport, etc. wit
 him during his highway ride?  One thing is for sure, O.J. will answer for what he has done in the end at the final judgement place we will all report to!!!
<LI>What a travesty of justice-anybody else would have been hung.
<LI>We sho watched should have not been so entertained by the murder of two people and the people who made money off of it.
<LI>Remember Nicole & Ron.........
<LI>oj is guilty of the crime of murder and should be hung, shot, lethally injected and electocuted
<LI>It's a sad statement that most blacks just really don't care about crime and have little morals.  That statement makes me a racist I guess but its true.  If anyone thinks otherwise just take a walk in any black neigborhood in any major city late at night and see otherwise.  It's time to stop using racism as an excuse for crime. 
<LI>If you have money you can even buy "innocence"
<LI>O.J. can bite me!!!
<LI>It was considered entertainment by the majority of the public when it should have been taken more seriously.  People lost their lives and the media exploited the incident just because someone famous was involved.
<LI>oj is a sick man. If he wasn't black justice would have prevailed.
<LI>It's not over yet:  "Vengence is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."
<LI>There was reasonable doubt, and LAPD did a appalling job.
<LI>If the glove had fit, defense would've had a shit!!!!
<LI>The fact that the defense could get away with the large-scale use of ``fake science'' and racist agitation, in addition to the use of focus groups and controlled jury selection, strikes me as a failure of the worst order of the American justice system.
<LI>When are they going to re-open the other cases Mark Furman testified and help convict?  Why is that the Los Angeles distric Attorneys offic can break constitutional rules with no recourse, and finaly Will Gil Garceti have the heart to run for re-election?
<LI>I think that trial was a mockery of the criminal courts systems in the U.S.  The things that went on were both childish and unethical
<LI>it is a crying shame that the two families had to go through such an incredible mess only to be left without knowing exactly who is to blame for these murders.  i think that oj did commit the murders but because of the fact that the weapon was never found and that there were no eye witnesses it makes it hard to eliminate the reasonalbe doubt factor.  However, he still has to make it through the civil suits.
<LI>It sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>OJ may not be known for throwing a football but he is sure hell known for throwing a knife!!!!
<LI>I hope the Brown and Goldman families finally get justice in the civil action. OJ did it.
<LI>The trial was much too long.
<LI>The American Judicial system is designed to product the black minority and white establishment - If OJ was white he would have been convicted.
<LI>Just goes to show you what can be done with MONEY MONEY MONEY
<LI>to long
<LI>Nothing to do with the trial really....I was just thinking of a script for "The Simpsons" and how to tie in OJ. Whadaya think of this: One Homer's ancestors, (say, his great-great-great-great grandmother) was a Southern slut who banged one of the slaves on the plantation her daddy owned. Just trace both sides down to our day, and what do you have?! Give me Homer or Bart anyday over OJ!  Pretty cool idea eh?  I'm wasted at my job here....what the hell AM I doing here any way?
<LI>It's all crap. It was popular just because he is famous!
<LI>whether or not he is guilty, there is reasonable doubt
<LI>the whole thing made me sick!!!
<LI>He did it and only a racist cop and a shrewed lawter made the difference.  I just feel let down by the system.
<LI>Juistice does not exist in America.  If you're rich and/or black, you obviosly can get away with murder!
<LI>The whole circus made me sick
<LI>As long as our judicial system is based on reasonable, I don't believe that a single person should be dissatisfied with the verdict.  There were too many questionable things about this case.  The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable do
<LI>Now that it is over with, forget it!
<LI>it sucked
<LI>I belive that race played a big part in the case. I also think that Mark is a liar and a races cop I think they just framed O.J. because of his race and that they put Mark on the case because he is a races COP!!! 
<LI>I think OJ's son and Kato did it.  OJ's son, because of the close DNA.  Kato, because nobody could REALLY be that stupid.
<LI>What a crock
<LI>Americans are sad, if the likes of OJ make prime time.
<LI>I think your mother should get them!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I feel that Kato Kaelin has some knowledge of who dunnit, if he didn't do it himself.
<LI>Although I answered These ?'s --I am pretty sick of hearing about them!
<LI>Too complicated for jurors
<LI>I think they should leave him alone,he deserved to win,and they keep spying on him
<LI>If you want to kill someone do it in LA
<LI>i think the ``trial of the century'' was not only an embarrassment to America, but proved how low our entertainment level has sunk.  the majority of americans, it seems, can watch anything.
<LI>We will avenge the murder of Ron Goldman,an innocent Jew killed by a black nigger. We are the Jewish Defense League and will not tolerate this killing. OJ. You best watch your step. NEVER AGAIN!
<LI>They should investigate OJ for the JFK assasination.Maybe he was involved
<LI>A tragedy.
<LI>Where the hell do I view the poles that were already taken?
<LI>It was about 9 months too long.
<LI>Marcia was unappreciated and overmanaged,  The commentators waffled with each days' news, though Geraldo--God bless him--did the best job of creating an exciting and (generally) knowledgeable exchange on the subject.  Ito should have shut Cochrane down ea
<LI>Too much tv coverage made it very boring
<LI>It was a waste of time because he was innocent.
<LI>Who cares?
<LI>This trial proves the corrupt LAPD and something drastic must be done to ensure justice is not burdened by a police system which is unreliable.
<LI>I think it's very possible OJ did commit murder, however the LAPD screwed up so much that so much reasonable doubt was created. I would have found him not guilty, however I would not have found him "innocent"
<LI>It sucked!
<LI>Guilty as Sin. Why didn't you cross-tab these results by race?
<LI>Celebrity justice is injustice for the rest of society.
<LI>It shows money can buy freedom.
<LI>i dont know whether he is innocent or not, so he is free
<LI>Trial was a travesty; and media coverage, dull as dirt.
<LI>GUILTY!!
<LI>oj should have died!!!!!
<LI>money talks!
<LI>Really, was anyone surprised by the results of this circus, er, trial? O.J. had the cash, he bought the most effective (not necessarily "best") defense, which pulled out all the stops. This clogged the proceedings, the jury of nitwits got bored because they were missing out on "Who's the Boss?" reruns, and conveiniently render a verdict based on "reasonable doubt". Then people who are totally ignorant base everything on race (regardless of their own). All in all, a sorry waste of time and brain matter.
<LI>Pros. did not do their job. Too much doubt and mishandlng of Evidence. The media convicted him before the trial and mis-informed public of what was said in the trial.
<LI>Too higly publicised, take a pill and lie dowm
<LI>Justice will be served when O.J.s children grow up and realize that he killed their mother and they do the same to him!
<LI>He's guilty, the jury musta been stoned
<LI>OJ got away with murder!
<LI>Do not uderstand why so much damning evidence, i.e. Bronco chase, was not presented.
<LI>A bloody mess, and a sure sign of how culturally dumb we are.
<LI>I hope somebody shoots the bastard
<LI>I have lost a lot of faith that I had in the judicial system and in race related problems.
<LI>O.J. Simpson is guity but they didn't prove O.J. did it
<LI>The whole event was a sad sight to see!
<LI>THERE WAS RESONABLE DOUBT, THEREFORE THEY MUST AQUIT!
<LI>I sure was irritated by the jurors who appeared on the talk shows after the verdict. They are so...dim.
<LI>JURY SHOULD BE COMPRISED OF 4 PEOPLE FROM EACH RACE
<LI>The bastard is guilty as hell and walking the streets a free man because of the color of his skin.
<LI>every one involved was for themselves and their own prestige, the victims were forgotten.
<LI>oj got away with murder. i hope he pays some other way!
<LI>A travesty
<LI>Gave ne a better sense of empathy with rioters after the Rodney King verdict!
<LI>I think the race issue was created by the Media.  The only people they interviewed who agreed with the verdict were black and the only people they interviewed who disagreed with the verdict were white.  If anyone had an opinion that did not conform to those race lines, they were never heard.
<LI>O.J. Simpson is the most Guiltiest Son of a Bitch I have ever seen!
<LI>What a disgrace! This was a murder trial, but the prosecution successfully introduced the extraneous matters of race, Mark Fuhrmann, the LAPD.  The jury ought to be indicted for stupidity.  Maybe at least we'll learn a few things from this trial, like: Don't sequester juries.  Require trials to be concluded in a reasonable time period. Johnnie Cochran is a sleazy lawyer in a $700 suit who has, unfortunately, become a celebrity in some quarters.
<LI>not on the trial--but correct spellings are PERJURY AND EMBARRASSMENT
<LI>It was a waste of time.
<LI>I think this trial just goes to show that racism aginst blacks and I think importantly against whites is still very much alive in this country!
<LI>it was very very long!!!
<LI>too long
<LI>as it has been asked...if not oj,then who? he did it!
<LI>I feel that the jury had no evidence of convicting OJ.  Who do you know who where's a sweat suit with fine leather Italian shoes, wouldn't tennis shoes have been more practical??????????? 
<LI>To answer question four fairly you would have to understand the way the judicual system works and
<LI>FURMAN'S PURGERY RUINED THE PROSECUTION
<LI>i didn't actually watch any of it. (what a freak, huh?)
<LI>The American society in a microcosm.
<LI>There was a lot of evidence in the case that we as the public did not get to see or hear...  That makes it difficult to judge how the trial went.
<LI>THE KIDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE WITH O J AND THE BROWN FAMILY WITHOUT A LOT OF HASSEL AND ARGUING.  BOTH SIDES LOVE THEM VERY MUCH AND I'M SURE THE KIDS FEEL THE SAME.  THIS NEEDS TO BE A CONCERTED EFFORT ON BOTH SIDES FOR THE SAKE OF SIDNEY AND JUSTIN.
<LI>The message  is  clear  :   money     talks.
<LI>The trial was one of the biggest jokes in the world .th
<LI>The only people (generally) who seem to think that he's innocent, are poor blacks with very limited intelligence. I am so sick of blacks using racism as an excuse for everything. They've been in the U.S. longer than any other "visible miniority" by about 300 years, and yet, even with all the laws forcing businesses and schools to hire them (giving them the edge, in fact), after they can apply for government grants like anyone else, they STILL have not progressed. They generally live in squalor, they ha
e the highest rate of unwed mothers (who naturally go on welfare as they probably don't even know who the father was), and their children learn how to steal cars and sell drugs before they can walk.  As a nation, they are complete losers.
<LI>It is over...  Keep it that way!
<LI>I THINK THERE WAS TOO MUCH HIPE ABOUT THE TRIAL
<LI>it was a sham
<LI>We don't know how he did it but he has there blood on him.
<LI>it was a boring show of crap and i hope i never see it again
<LI>He's guilty as sin!! Burn, oj! Burn!
<LI>the ampunt of money spent on the trial would have kept a third world country fed for a year.....
<LI>Big Damn Joke
<LI>I always knew he was innocent!
<LI>Its a sorry thing that 2 murders had to influence our lives like this..
<LI>What a crock! The entire trial was a joke. OJ is guilty as sin and everyone knows it.
<LI>guilty but let off because of the oppression of the past
<LI>it deeply repulsed me .I felt very ill afterwards .
<LI>the trial sucked!!!!!
<LI>LA law enforcement leaves something to desire.
<LI>SICK, SICK, SICK!
<LI>I think he got away with murder.
<LI>This trial was a total JOKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>This trial shows that race will always be a factor in everything in America.
<LI>We have a faulty judicial system.
<LI>RACISM DOES NOT PAY! ELIMINATE RACISM NOW! LAPD SMARTEN UP!
<LI>The jurors were too stupid to see the facts through their own ignorance!
<LI>he was guilty,but there was reasonable doubt.
<LI>i wish all concerned were caught in a nuclear holocaust!!!!!
<LI>I bet Macia Clark thinks Chris Darden is still doing a good job on her!!!
<LI>THIS SURVEY SUCKS
<LI>glad it's over!
<LI>I think strongly feel that he didn't commit the murders
<LI>OJ got off for many reasons..great defense, prosecution errors in detecting and caring for evidence, racism everywhere, especially in the law enforcement, I think evidence was planted, or totally not taken care of correctly, and the trial was so lengthy the jury also wanted to just go home. I believe OJ was not alone in this and that we will never find out who he protected, altho I have an idea, either way..he got away with it..but for what price..for the rest of his life..I hope! Two people are dead..
e is a free man..I hope he pays for this for the rest of his life.
<LI>Our System is now a BIG JOKE!!!let all of the convicts go free'they let O.J. go free!!!
<LI>defense attys. need more restrictions  
<LI>OJ should fry.
<LI>I think leaving domestic violence evidence out of the trial severly hurt the outcome.  People don't understand the systemic disease and how it can affect even the best of us..
<LI>Nice mole for Marcia.  GOD will try and convict OJ.  Remember that.
<LI>Know the difference between O.J. & Christopher Reeve? O.J. walked!
<LI>There was too much media coverage. I feel that the only reason the media made such a big deal about this case was because OJ was a rich black man and Nicole Simpson was white. Susan Smith drwoned her own children yet her trial was not turned into a media 
<LI>Black jurars will not convict a black celeberty
<LI>O.J. was a wife beater, what's to say he isn't a wife killer!
<LI>I thought it was a disgrace to the United States.  The jury voted not guilty, because he was black & they wanted to make a statement- but in the meatime, they let a murderer free.  They should have made a statement in a positive way, not a negative way.
<LI>He WILL be found guilty in the civil trials!
<LI>hip hip horray
<LI>The fact that a murderer like OJ Simpson is free to walk among us, is a crime in itself.  This has put the black community back another few steps.
<LI>The trial changed me - no longer a liberal.
<LI>WAKE UP WHITE FOLKS, YOU GUYS HAD HIM, DON'T BE MAD AT OJ, IF YOU WERE IN HIS SHOES YOU WOULD DO THE SAME THING, YOU THINK OJ CARES WHAT YOU THINK?  i WOULDN'T, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT YOUR SYSTEM AND M MAKE CHANGESES FROM THE TOP OF YOUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
<LI>Not racial, it was the jury rules.......reasonable doubt!!!
<LI>Perhaps White America will wake up !
<LI>This verdict made me want to kill somebody
<LI>The trail was a total disgrace.  OJ did it and he got off because he had a whole bunch of money.  He should have been sentenced to the highest form of punishment
<LI>OJ needs todo Naked Gun 4!
<LI>I think that the main reason there were so many problems with this trial is because of all the media coverage.  Also there is no reason that the trial should have taken as long as it did. If it had been anyone besides a celebrity like O.J the trial would have been over and done with before you had the chance to blink!!
<LI>I sincerely hope that future jurors will have to take IQ tests to see if anything is rattling around upstairs.  To hear statements from that big fat black juror stating that wife beating had nothing to do with this murder shows how limited her intelligence must be. Over half of the women who are murdered in the States every year, are murdered BY THEIR SPOUSES OR FORMER SPOUSES!! To say that wife beating is not related to this murder, is like saying that smoking has nothing to do with lung cancer.
<LI>mother always said"What goes around, comes around"
<LI>prosecution did a great job.  the defense did their job, blew smoke over the prosecutions case, BUT they did not disprove anything.
<LI>NO new taxes; NO more OJ!!
<LI>Went out of my way to avoid watching the trial so could not really rate the lawyers other than to say they must of been doing their job.  It's too bad you didn't put OJ's friend Al Crowley on the list of suspects.  He is high on my list as a possible suspect. (Prime suspect for a Murder Mystery <grin>
<LI>it was the biggest farce of the century
<LI>IF YOU WANT JUSTICE YOU NEED TO HAVE PLENTY OF $$$$$$$
<LI>Bull shit,people...money can buy you a freedom...
<LI>Now, if he'd have been poor, he would have been found guilty. Its not so much a race issue as a class issue.
<LI>I think that the total case was based upon fucking race card from the begining: note to O.J. kiss my ass, you killer
<LI>Now what am I supposed to watch on TV???
<LI>To much time spent on racecial issues. DNA validity most people are not qualified to understand even the lawyers didn't
<LI>Only in the United States... makes me happy to be Canadian.
<LI>He was acqitted to prevent race riots in LA
<LI>ITS A SAD DAY IN AMERICA WHEN SOMEONE CAN GET AWAY WITH A DOUBLE MURDER!
<LI>I believe tha they should look at other possible people who may have had a reason for seeing Nicole and Ron dead and for giving a lot of greif to OJ.  One of the most prominent that I can think of is KATO .  I have asked a few people I know, including some psychics.  All of them think that he is a good suspect.  Why doen`t the LAPD pursue this
<LI>Thank God it's over!!
<LI>OJ has his own right to protest from his wife from doing drugs dealing or whore.
<LI>Total waste of Tax Payer's $$,$$$,$$$,$$$
<LI>satan rules and oj is gay
<LI>O.J. is as guilty as sin!
<LI>The whole system was a joke, as a black woman, I felt violated by the whole thing.  It was a sad day.
<LI>It sure blows my image of trials being like Perry Mason!! If your gonna kill someone you'd better be rich!
<LI>greatly disappointed
<LI>It destroyed the system of American Justice, and was nothing but a Circus.  It looked like Washington, District of Crooks
<LI>It's an extreme case. It doesn't say anything in terms of this country's legal system.
<LI>It sucked!
<LI>nordberg should burn in HELL!!!
<LI>If there's enough money, anything can be bought...including justice.
<LI>if the media hadn't gotten involved it would of been a much fairer trial. But that's America for you.
<LI>It's surprising how people are found guilty before innocent
<LI>Whatever happened to Al Cowlings?
<LI>Why did he flee in the Bronco if he was not guilty?!?!
<LI>This trial was a joke.  It just reaffirms that money CAN buy everything!
<LI>A lack of solid evident and sloppy work proved him innocent. 
<LI>Lawers exist in a moral vacuum.  Truth and justice had nothing to do with this trial.  Two people died and a cottage industry was created.  All that is ugly in human nature was on full display.
<LI>The trial took too long, they were presenting too much stuff that was not relevant to the case. 
<LI>My faith has never been in the police, but in our citizens
<LI>THE VERDICT WAS A SAD COMMENTARY BOTH IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.  THAT THE JURY WOULD TOTALLY DISMISS THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON THE BASIS OF A RIDICULOUS ACCUSATION OF EVIDENCE TAMPERING IS BEYOND ME.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>It was a total waste of tv air time
<LI>you all are a bunch of cornballs.
<LI>Jury system sucks shit
<LI>Cochran in a pig who always brings race into a non-racial case! He should be shot!
<LI>This was a racist jury If OJ was white he would be guilty
<LI>It was a travesty.
<LI>The trial sucks big time!
<LI>He was obviously guilty, but the prosecution screwed up
<LI>All said and done, whether OJ was guilty is now irrelevant. The state failed to provide enough evidence (and much of that they did provide was of a questionable nature) and in the end, that was Marcia Clark's resxponsibility. She should never have gone to trial knowing that her case was built on lies if she really believed he was guilty. Miscarriage of justice it might have been, but the jury only acted within their remit. As for money - of course OJ bought the Not Guilty verdict *because he could affo
d a top of the range legal team*. There are no laws against having the best money can buy. But the guy was found not guilty, so leave him alone, and sort out the real problems with the country - namely those of race relations.
<LI>who cares anymore??
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!
<LI>Rush to judgement prevented proving anyone guilty.
<LI>To bad Milk could not be the juice ? Then we could have said what trial? THIS IS ALL PART OF THE PLAN. MY ARIAN BROTHERS WE  MUST ASK OURSELVES  NOT TO BE SO JUDGEMENTAL OF THE BLACK. AFTER ALL WE FOOLE THEM FOR ALL THIS TIME. THEY WERE PRAYING TO A VERSI
<LI>If OJ was a White person there would not have been so much publicity! 
<LI>it was a pathetic excuse for a trial
<LI>We all would like to have the juices money! Because man he sure get's a lot of white putane!
<LI>Having been on juries in serious cases, all I can say is that the prosecution *MUST* prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt - if they do not, the only possible vote for the jury members is 'not guilty' even if they think the person is.
<LI>National Crisis
<LI>oj should have been hung with piano wire
<LI>I think America is a racist society that needs some serious 
<LI>ATHLETES DO NO WRONG
<LI>UM HELLO DNA DOESN'T LIE
<LI>Johhnie Cockran, like him or not, is a credit to the legal system.  He did what he was paid to do.  The LAPD & DA's Office got the messages they need to "reconsttruct". Finally, I think the American people are smarter than one would imagine. Conclusion, let's face it---"They all performed for the media.""
<LI>It's FINALLY over.
<LI>All jurors say they think he's innocent, none of them claimed reasonable doubt
<LI>I believe that the prosecution flubbed it, and that the jury was influenced by race, purgery, tired of serving, and protesting the LAPD all in one.
<LI>OJ Sucks
<LI>Help the Browns recover and maintain custody of minors involved.
<LI>The Justice system has not kept pace with Society.
<LI>The primary factor which helped O.J. be acquitted of his crimes was his social and financial status.  Had any other man of lower social stature been accused of committing these crimes, be him black or white, he would have been sentenced to death.  
<LI>The more important issue is not race, but money. If OJ had been a poor black or a poor white, he would probably have been found guilty, but if he had been a rich white, he would have been found innocent. Wealth can and does pervert justice.
<LI>dissapointed at the outcome
<LI>The jurors wanted the fame and fortune for serving in the OJ trial.
<LI>Only in Californa, the land of fruits & nuts could such a travesty of justice occur.  The whole thing made a mockary of the criminal justice system.
<LI>GUITLTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>The O.J. Simpson trial was a public hanging. It was a statement on the bastard white folks that run this damned country.
<LI>It was important that overall mistrust in the Police Department were raised, however it was at the expense of the victim's lives.
<LI>The world is laughing at America -Again...
<LI>This trial was over publisised, too long, and it had a bad conclution.
<LI>I dont believe there was any way a black jury would convict O J 
<LI>I think this whole black white thing has got to end!  The Nation of Islam can go to HELL.  If it had been a white man accused  of murdering two blacks and the Arian Nation was standing behind him waiting for the verdict there would of been WW3 here in the USA.  Wake up people deal with your ansestors trial and tribulations and stop trying to punish this generation  for things we never did or could never concive!
<LI>THE BLACK HAS NO INTENTION OF BECOMING PART OF THIS SOCIETY. I'LL SAY THIS TO ALL THE BLACKS OUT THERE, YOU ARE MAKING FOOLS OF YOURSELF BY BLAMING ALL YOUR PROBLEMS ON THE WHITES. IT IS YOU THAT TRASHED THE INTER-CITIES OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS YOU THAT HAS RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM. IT IS YOU THAT ARE KILLING EACH OTHER THROUGH YOUR GANG VIOLENCE AND THE LIKE. MOST OF THE BLACKS HAVE NO INTENTION OF GETTING OUT OF THE GUTTER. BY NATURE, THE BLACK CANNOT LIVE IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY, LOOK AT AFRICA AND HA
TI !
<LI>It don't think the jurors were a bunch of racists. They were tired, The DNA sampling and analytical protocols  appeared to overwhelm them.
<LI>The jury was ignorant and demonstates one of our society's major problem: lack of education
<LI>OJ is guilty as Hell and the only reason he got off was because he was black and so was the whole damn jury.  I don't mean this to sound racial.  No offense implied.
<LI>I think that the "statement on the issue of race" that the jury made has done much more harm than good...it's divided the classes and races of the American public.
<LI>This is a sad commentary on American SOCIETY.
<LI>He should appear on Letterman
<LI>Justice was not served w/the verdict.
<LI>Money buys freedom.
<LI>OJ was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Maybe there was some doubt, but no reasonable doubt.
<LI>I believe race was a factor in the verdict because it WAS a factor in Mark Furman's purgery.  However, I believe the verdict was a statement of the people that whenever possible, heavyhanded governments agents will be rendered impotent to destroy a person
<LI>sad state of affairs on the current state of this country
<LI>Don't blame the jury sloppy work on all sides of justice 
<LI>Everyone who was invovled in the trial has no private life right now.
<LI>oj is a piece of shit
<LI>O.J. is Gulity
<LI>It sucked.
<LI>Shakespeare was right; if you want injustice, kill all the lawyers.
<LI>Not Guilty!!!
<LI>If the Butcher of Brentwood didn't do it then Monkeys will fly out of my BUTT!!
<LI>Orenthal James Simpson is proof that money is the only thing that counts in todays world.
<LI>Jury made the right decision, even though he was guilty.
<LI>I think that there was reasonable doubt.  We will never know if he really did it, but he was acquitted, so people need to let it go.  That show has been CANCELED!!!
<LI>O.J. was guily as @#$&!  Racism was a big part.
<LI>A complete joke, I wish it was never televised.
<LI>I wish the mediadidn' made out to be as big a deal as it was.
<LI>O.J. Simpson had a knife
<LI>I personnaly thought there was too much covery and it interupted a lot television showa here in Canada
<LI>I am considering moving to another country. Guilty Uncle Tom.
<LI>I think that O.J. is completely innocent but I don't think he actually killed them.  
<LI>The evidence was there.  LAPD self-destructed.  Furhman is a poor use of protoplasm.
<LI>Missed my soaps
<LI>god, why do so many people care about this OJ thing?  i'm only answering this survey because i'm bored while FTP'ing stuff...
<LI>OJ is guilty as SIN!!!
<LI>O.J is the only suspect in this trial, if he's innocent... then who did it?
<LI>According to the media, no one wants OJ around.....he's welcome to come live near us!
<LI>The US of A on its way down the drain. So long.
<LI>OJ and Nicole had no race issue, why should we? The jury did
<LI>O.j. Simpson will end up dead sometime, Goldberg's father will not let this rest. Simpson is a criminal and should be an emmbarrassment to the black community!
<LI>HOPE THEY THROW THE MURDERER OUT WHEN HE COMES TO A.C. NJ
<LI>The trial was over-publicised, and the prosecution screwed it up beyond help! Marcia Clark to me, was a whiny bitch! She needs to regroup!
<LI>Travesty!
<LI>OJ is just a nigger who got away with murder.
<LI>disgusting
<LI>i would like to eat o.j. poop
<LI>If the jurors understood DNA, guilty verdict.
<LI>Mark Furhmen wanted to fuck O.J. Simpson.  You could see it in his eyes!!
<LI>California Circus
<LI>Can't buy me love, but can buy me justice
<LI>I think he did it, doesn't matter what his colour was He's a piece of shit !
<LI>If anyone hires "OJ" in his life,I will actively picket and boycott them. He should exile himself to another country.
<LI>The media think they own the world
<LI>Virginia hasn't learned a thing from this trial.
<LI>oj simpson is no longer a her
<LI>I still can't believe the jury did not find enoughmevidence to find him guilty?????
<LI>The defense, especially Cochran, is SLEEZE and RACIST!
<LI>I am a white middle class male.  I live in Kansas City, and have never met the LAPD or anyone else in LA.  Yet, after seeing the evidence, I find reasonable doubt.  Not because of race, but because of the facts.  By the way, check out Steven Emerson's new (and old) books.  The inside word on terrorism and the middle East.  (Also read his frequent guest columns in the New York Times.  He's my favorite journalist!!)
<LI>if OJ is a Killer, he WILL FRY IN HELL..
<LI>THis is just the latest in a string of disastrous failures for the LAPD and the LA prosecutors.   Remember the McMartin preschool trial, in which all of the defendants were acquitted because all of that satan worship evidence was a load of *BULLSHIT?*  That was another famous Gil Carcetti performance.  The police and prosecutors in LA have pissed away all of their credibility.
<LI>whata a joke of a trial
<LI>THANK GOD IT IS OVER!!
<LI>it was a very long, drawn out process. Even though he was found not guilty, I feel that if he didn't do it, who did?  The children should be put into his custody, however, because there is no reason for him to not be with his children.  He was found not guilty.
<LI>O.J. was aquitted,live with the verdict and let him get on with his life.
<LI>He was a wife-beater, and he is scum for that; but that had _nothing_ to do with killing Ron and Nichole, and should not have been evidence. The entire trial was a travesty.
<LI>I think that the worst part about the whole think is that Sidney and Justin have to grow up without their mommy, and know that she was murdered.  The children always suffer the most.
<LI>No truth and no justice... If you have the money.
<LI>the justice system has long been a mess --people know that now. This could be good eventually if it leads to reforms
<LI>Justice is blind, and a man is innocent until PROVEN guilty
<LI>Fair coverage since the trial shouldn't have been on TV
<LI>People are very pig headed.  They can't the not guilty  verdict.....Well Tough!
<LI>MONEY TALKS AND BULLSHIT WALKS!!
<LI>I THINK IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A SIDE-SHOW CIRCUS!
<LI>I am an Indian and I came to U.S.A to do my Masters in computer science.  I am not a O.J fan nor do I know anything about football.  Only a couple of years back I came to your country.  The trial was a good exposure of the American Justice system.  I have that gut feeling that OJ did commit those murders but the prosecution was a total failure.  They just did not prove their case.  The bottom line is the American Justice system did work.  OJ was not convicted b'coz of miserable failures of the law enfo
cers namely the LAPD and the prosecutors.
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY. But of course he was let go "to make a statement on racism." [a.k.a. disregard the evidence]. But what did you expect?
<LI>If OJ did it, why wasn't there more blood in the bronco?
<LI>If you assume that the evidence wasn't ALL fabricated, then the only thing that makes sense is that OJ did it.
<LI>Send OJ lots of mirrors to help him in his search for the murderer
<LI>THE OJ SIMPSON TRIAL SHOWS HOW HIPOCRITICAL THE BLACK ARE AND HOW THEY ARE THE TRUE RACISTS. OJ GOT OFF NOT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS INNOCENT BUT BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.  NOW YOU HEAR ALL THESE BLACKS DENIYING IT, BUT REALLY STOP IT CAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE
<LI>those who picked the jury should be looking for new jobs.
<LI>it is a sad statement of affairs media wise, political wise and justice wise
<LI>The jury eduation was saddenly laking resulting in a not guilty. 
<LI>I hope Ron Goldman's dad kills O.J.!
<LI>I am sick and tired about hearing O.J. all the time
<LI>I think it is absolutely sick that a obviosly guilty man was set free because the jury was practically illiterate and O.J. is famous!!!!
<LI>THEY TRASH OUR INTER-CITIES, THEY RAPE OUR WELFARE SYSTEM, THEIR CRY BABY TACTICS HAVE CAUSED LIBERIAL AMERICA TO FOLLOW THEIR DESTRUCTIVE WAKE. LETS FACE IT THE BLACK DOES NOT WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS SOCIETY, NEVER HAS, NEVER WILL. I', GLAD THE SIMPSONS JURIES FINALLY BROUGHT THE WAKE UP CALL TO AMERICA. BLACKS HAVE BEEN AND ARE RACIST !!!!
<LI>Here is an example of how a GUILTY SCUMBAG can buy a not guilty p verdict.  It is significant that the decision did not find that simpson did not commit the murders,simply that the jury could not findd the gumption to send him to the chair given the poor case presented but fuhrmann and some others. SIMPSON IS GUILTY AND EVERYONE KNOWS THATT  ESPECIALLY SIMPSON AND COCHRANE.
<LI>I think it was a downfall for our jusyice system and I'm outraged
<LI>OJ SHOULD BE HUNG RIGHT ALONG SIDE MARK FUHRMAN AS WELL AS THE JURORS AND THE DEFENSE TEAM
<LI>justice was not served!!
<LI>A distressing statement of how bad race relations are in the US.
<LI>Said from the beginning HE DIDN'T DO IT !!!
<LI>keep it off TV in the future
<LI>Too much publicity.  Too much time elapse because of junk brought in.
<LI>He is guilty !!! There should be reason to retry him. Possibly investigate the Jury's quick deliberation.
<LI>What happened to the wife  abuse allegations. I think that the whole crime happened due to the escalation of O.J. 's jealousy and obsession with Nicole and that should have been concentrated on more than the "race issue" which apparently was not an issue for Nicole and O.J. at all!
<LI>The only reason OJ was aquitted is because he is BLACK
<LI>OJ is hot on the trail of the murder/s and does not believe there on any golf courses in Fl.
<LI>The jurors apparently thought they were judging a debate, rather than addressing the central question, did he do it.   
<LI>The jury was far too black.
<LI>I'm glad it's over
<LI>O.J. is filthy sleaza and being a celebrity in this country should not mean that you are allowed to commit a double murder and then not be found guilty by a jury whos race is bearly O.J.'s own.  If you want a jury of his peers lets find his old, white, go
