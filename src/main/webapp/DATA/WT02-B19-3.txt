Vetlife, Inc. President and CEO, Rich Shuler announced today that
under an agreement with Elanco Animal Health, a Division of Eli
Lilly and Company, Vetlife will become the exclusive U.S. supplier
of Compudose Cattle Growth Implants, effective October 1, 1996.
 Controlled-release Compudose will be the first of a complete
range of growth-promoting implant products sold by Vetlife, Inc.,
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:

Shuler commented, “We're excited about our agreement
with Elanco because it enhances our commitment to provide each
cattle producer with the best possible implant program to meet
production goals.” Shuler is the former Vice President
and General Manager of Syntex Animal Health.  <BR>

<P>
Effective January 1, 1997, Vetlife will also be the exclusive

growth implants, manufactured by Ivy Laboratories, Inc. of Overland,
Kansas.  Ivy, under the direction of CEO James Sollins, is a leading
manufacturer of cattle growth implants which are currently distributed
by the Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company.

<P>
When you combine Elanco's Compudose product, Ivy's
high quality line of implants and Vetlife's implant marketing
and technical expertise, beef producers will soon have access
to the most complete package of implant products and services
in the U.S.,” added Shuler.  

<P>
Vetlife, Inc. based in Atlanta, Georgia is engaged in the development,
licensing and marketing of technologies to improve the value of
