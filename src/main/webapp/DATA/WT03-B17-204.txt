        <STRONG><H2> If you Eliminate the Cause,
          You Eliminate it's Effects.</H2></STRONG>
     When dealing with diseases, it's the cause which you must control,
or  cure,  rather  then the effect (disease). I  will  not  attempt  to
describe  each  type of disease for you in this book.  There  are  many
books  out  which do just that, instead I will point you in  the  right
direction  since it has been my experience that you need not  know  the
name  of  the  disease to treat it. Remember, all diseases are  treated
basically  the  same way. As long as you treat the cause,  the  effects
will  disappear. If the disease is persistent after following the below
steps then proceed on to the organic disease control section.

<STRONG><H2>  Always key into Nutrition First.</H2></STRONG>
     What are you feeding your plants and soil?  Tell me the truth now,
really,  what are you feeding it?  If you say "nothing" then your  just
as bad as the person who says "I'm feeding it something I bought at the
nursery"! There is nothing like proper nutrition for proper health! For
as in  humans so it is with plants.

     <STRONG><H2> Always Seek Balance,
     When things are out of balance,
      Infestation and Disease occurs.</H2></STRONG>

     Balance is as important to the soil and plants as it is to humans.
When  things are in balance,  stress is reduced and all things function
accordingly.

 <STRONG><H2> The Good Guys and the Bad Guys
      don't live in the same place.</H2></STRONG>

  Bad  bacteria and good bacteria do not share the same  soil.  Dead
soil  is  not  actually dead but instead contains the presence  of  bad
bacteria or fungi or any number of disease sources.

    <STRONG><H2> Avoid High Nitrogen Fertilizers.</H2></STRONG>

    The  continual  use  of chemicals in the soil eventually  destroys
both  the  bacteriological and biological balance  of  the  soil.  Also
present  are the salt deposits of the various fertilizers,  etc.,  used
through  out the years. This causes major changes in the ph  levels  of
the soil effecting nutritional absorption by the plants. This will lead
to  higher  stress levels in all things associated with this soil.  The
application  of not only high nitrogen fertilizers but the  application
of  any  type  of fertilizer is very bad for the soil, the plants,  the
insects,  the animals, the birds and all humans involved. High nitrogen
also  promotes  the  various diseases found in the  garden.  Why?  High
nitrogen causes stress & imbalance in the soil & plants, the same way a
high  sugar diet does in humans. The more natural the sources the  more
acceptable the supply.

   <STRONG><H2> Poor health and high stress of
      plants are due to improper
               nutrition.
   </H2></STRONG>
  The  stronger the plant the less the disease will affect it. Avoid
using  any chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, etc.  Chemical
fertilizers are not complete foods. They provide only a small amount of
the  total  diet  required for healthy plant growth.  NPK  does  not  a
complete dinner for plants make!

<STRONG><H2> Stressed Out Plants..</H2></STRONG>

   The  same  rules  of pest control apply to disease  controls,  the
higher  the stress, the greater the problem associated with it and  the
harder it will be to control.

 <STRONG><H2>Dead or Water Soaked Soil.</H2></STRONG>

  Amend with compost, rock dust and animal manure if available.  You
should  have  plenty  of earthworms. Dead water soaked  soils  have  no
earthworms. Compost and mulching will increase organic matter  to  soil
allowing  bacterial  and nutritional resources  to  increase.  Increase
drainage.    Practice soil rotation if possible. Rotation of  crops  is
suggested whenever possible. If a raised bed is used allow the  bed  to
go fallow for one season.

<STRONG><H2> Some Diseases are introduced
                 by Viruses.</H2></STRONG>

    Destroy  diseased plants. Throw away in the trash. Do not  compost
since  most  backyard gardeners do not compost in big enough  piles  in
which  the  temperature  is  high enough  to  kill  the  fungi.   Avoid
spreading  the  disease by cleaning your tools with alcohol  in-between
cuttings..   Do not use chemical fungicides. They only will cause  more
problems both to your health and the soils health1. Use Compost tea.

 <STRONG><H2>Some Diseases are introduced
                 by Weeds.</H2></STRONG>

  Use  disease free seedlings and plants. Many diseases are  carried
from  one  plant  to  another  by humans, insects,  animals,  etc..  Be
especially  careful when bring potted plants with soil into  the  home.
Certain weeds are hosts to pests which carry the disease from one plant
to  another.,  therefore weed control of some type is important.  Weeds
can also provide homes for many beneficial  so choose carefully.

<STRONG><H2> Some Diseases are spread by Insects.</H2></STRONG>

  Many  diseases  are carried around by insects  such  as  the  ant.
Control the insect populations in your areas. Learn what insects spread
what disease.

   <STRONG><H2> Improper Varieties Planted.</H2></STRONG>

  Proper placement of variety is important. Choose a location  which
gets  as much light as needed by the plant for proper growth. Make sure
the  plant(s)  will  grow  normally in your area.  Choose  the  correct
variety for your area. Heirloom varieties are stronger and more  suited
for  organic gardening. Write to Abundant Life Foundation or  Seeds  of
Change.  See Resources Directory for their address. Use Trap  crops  in
addition  to various types of traps which attracts the pests away  from
the garden.

<STRONG><H2> Improper Planting Time.</H2></STRONG>

     Observe  the  correct planting dates on vegetables, etc  for  best
results. Planting during the wrong time of year also exposes plants  to
insects  that  would not normally effect your plants if they  had  been
planted  at  the  right  time. Also temp and amount  of  day  light  is
important.

   <STRONG><H2> Improper Watering  Techniques.</H2></STRONG>

    Avoid  overhead  watering. Use a soaker hose or  a  drip  system
  when ever possible.

<STRONG><H2>How Important is it to Identify the Disease?</H2></STRONG>

    Diseases in different plants may have the same name but will  show
different  symptoms  thus  making Identifying  very  difficult  if  not
impossible.    While  I encourage you to try and Identify  the  disease
that  is  attacking  your plant(s), you must remember  that  the  basic
treatment(s) remains the same regardless of the disease. This book  was
not  designed  to help you to identify the pest or disease.  There  are
many books out there that are good for that purpose.

          It doesn't take magic to
          control diseases naturally!</H1></STRONG>
