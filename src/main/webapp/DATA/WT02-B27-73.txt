Metacognition is generally defined as including one or more of the following: active monitoring, conscious control, or executive regulation of mental processes.<BR>
<BR>
Metacognition has been linked to a wide variety of positive academic outcomes for students, such as better grades and performance on tests of intelligence. There has been some suggestion that gifted students use more metacognitive strategies than non-gifted students. There has also been research suggesting that learning disabled students can benefit from using these strategies. So, it is important for teachers to be aware of metacognition. There are also ways teachers can encourage metacognition.<BR>

<LI> <A HREF="MetaDef">What is metacognition, anyway?</A>.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF="MetaHist">Historical perspectives on metacognition</A>.  Metacognition isn't just a recent psychological idea. Similar concepts have been discussed since William James and Vygotsky, although these concepts were not really fully integrated into teaching and education.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF="MetaCur">Current perspectives on metacognition</A>.  Metacognition has really taken off since Flavell's 1976 and 1979 articles. What's being said about it currently, and how does it relate to teaching and learning as we face the 21st century?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF="MetaMarg">Metacognition and marginal students</A>.  Lots of research has focused on learning-disabled and gifted students. How does metacognition relate to these concepts, and what does it do for classrooms<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF="MetaTeach">Teaching for metacognition</A>.   OK, so metacognition seems to help students. There are several simple things teachers can incorporate into their classes to help your students become more metacognitive.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF="MetaIssues">Issues of which to be aware</A>.  Is knowing which strategy to use to solve a math problem truly metacognition? What about knowing how to read Shakespeare? What about knowing that you study better in a brightly lit room? And how does one assess metacognition? There are lots of issues to deal with as this field grows into its own.<BR>
