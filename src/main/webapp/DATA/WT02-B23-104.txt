<HR>
<CENTER><H2>ASSOCIATION POLITICAL AGENDA</H2></CENTER>

Among the items that the Association intends to address in 1995 are the 
following. It is expected that this list is a 'living' document, which 
will be expanded to include other federal and state issues as they arise.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Telecom Reform</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The renewed push for telecommunications reform legislation is vitally 
important to all segments of our industry.  Some issues that this 
legislation address include:  1) Should local phone companies be allowed – 
through a manufacturing subsidiary – to manufacture equipment that 
connects to a phone jack (PC, fax, modem), including the software that 
runs such equipment?;  2) Should the manufacturing subsidiary be allowed 
to use the phone company's abundant information on customers to target, 
advertise, sell, install, network, and maintain such equipment in direct 
competition with the computer reseller channel?;  3) Should cable companies 
retain a monopoly on the sale, lease, and distribution of set-top boxes?; 
and  4) Should electronic content be afforded the same 1st amendment 
protections as printed speech or should criminal penalties be assessed on 
individuals who "make available potentially lewd, indecent or harassing" 
communications?<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  The Association will lobby the Congress on these 
issues, arguing that open competition is desirable to the extent that the 
transition from a regulated, monopolistic environment does not unfairly 
affect the already hyper-competitive microcomputer industry.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>FCC Certification</STRONG><BR><BR>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a formal Notice of 
Proposed Rule Making on February 7, 1995.  Proposing that 
personal computers and personal computer peripherals be certified based on 
the manufacturer's or supplier's declaration of compliance, eliminating 
much of the bureaucratic red tap that often stymies or delays getting new 
products to market. Further, the FCC proposed that if individual components 
in computer equipment (CPU, power supply and case) are certified, additional 
testing of the completed assembly is not required.<BR>
<STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  After considerably study by the Public Policy 
Committee and its Technical Subcommittee, the Association submitted formal 
comments to the FCC supporting the general concept of streamlining the
authorization process.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Mail Order Issue</STRONG><BR><BR>
For the past several years, the Association has supported legislation that 
would authorize states to require mail order companies to collect and 
remit sales tax to the state to which product is delivered.  Testifying 
before the Senate Small Business Committee, the Association argued that 
the competitive advantage of mail order companies that do not collect sales 
tax is at least equal to the state's sales tax. The Association also 
argued that leveling the playing field would make the industry more 
competitive.<BR>
<STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  Senator Dale Bumpers (D-AR) has reintroduced a 
bill that would authorize states to require mail order companies to collect 
and remit sales tax to the state to which merchandise is ultimately 
delivered. Because of the bill's bipartisan support last year, the 
Association expects the bill will be considered by Committee although 
enactment is not guaranteed.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>National Information Infrastructure (NII)</STRONG><BR><BR>
The NII, or Information Superhighway, is a seamless web of communications 
networks piping information via various means (phone, cable, cellular, 
satellite, broadcast, electric power grid) utilizing various information 
appliances (PC, TV, PDA, notebook, cellular phone, fax). With the 
convergence of technologies comes the convergence of competing industries,
making involvement by federal and state government all but inevitable. A 
key question that the Association must address concerns the modern concept 
of "universal service."  For the past 60 years, universal service has meant 
that businesses and urban dwellers would subsidize phone service to rural 
areas where the cost of providing such services is higher. In the 21st 
century, what services are so essential to all Americans that the government 
has an affirmative responsibility to declare that all Americans must 
possess or have access to the services? To paraphrase a recent column in 
the Wall Street Journal, "Do Americans have an inalienable right to a 
computer, modem and the Internet?"
<BR><STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  A concept paper on the NII is being prepared 
by the Public Policy office of CompTIA.  Once approved, this concept paper 
will serve as the basis for the Association's political positions and 
strategies with respect to the NII.<BR><BR>

CTIA’s Weinberger Tells House Subcommittee</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Certain non-profit companies– in particular, 
college bookstores – are using their tax exempt status to gain an 
unfair advantage in selling computers, Alan Weinberger, Public Policy 
Committee Chairman of the Computing Technology Industry Association, 
told the House Small Business Subcommittee on Procurement, Taxation 
and Tourism. The 12-year-old Association represents more than 3,000 
companies from all segments of the computer and information technology 
industries.

Weinberger recently testified before the House Subcommittee because, 
he said, “Exempt from certain taxes, these non-profit companies can 
sell computers and computer-related equipment for less than what a 
for-profit reseller can purchase the same equipment at wholesale.”  
Except for their tax-exempt status, a for-profit computer reseller and 
a college bookstore are often exactly the same, Weinberger declared.  
“And, we at CTIA believe, that if it walks like a duck and quacks like 
a duck, then it probably is a duck.  We also believe that all ducks 
should be taxed the same.”  Weinberger is Chairman and CEO of The 
ASCII Group, Inc., a Bethesda, MD-based chain of independent computer 
resellers.

A long time member of the Computing Technology Industry Association, 
Weinberger had been authorized by the Board of Directors of the 
Association to address the impact of unfair competition on for-profit 
computer resellers.  He stressed that an open market is essential in 
the computer industry, which reinvents itself about every 18 months 
with new products, technologies, upgrades and services.

Weinberger went on to note that bookstores that sell computers often 
argue that they provide a unique and valuable service to students.  
But Weinberger asserted that it doesn’t stop there.  “Sales of 
computers are not limited to just students.  Faculty and staff are 
permitted to purchase the computers, as well.  And, in many cases,” 
Weinberger continued, “ a business that employs a student on a 
part-time basis can also purchase a computer through this indirect 
channel.  In essence, nearly anyone can buy a computer from a 
bookstore.”

In his testimony, Weinberger gave the House Subcommittee several 
concrete examples of the impact of unfair competition because of the 
tax code loophole. According to Weinberger, one for profit computer 
reseller in Ann Arbor, MI, has been closed out of the retail market 
because of pricing pressures from the University of Michigan 
bookstore. Unable to compete with the bookstore, which is defacto the 
largest computer dealer in the area, the Ann Arbor reseller was forced 
to change its focus and now concentrates on sales and service to 
businesses and no longer maintains a storefront.

In another example cited by Weinberger in his testimony, a computer 
reseller saw sales plummet over 90% when the neighboring University of 
Kansas bookstore began selling computers.  Of the five resellers 
originally located near the University, only two remain in business.  
“With their price advantage,” Weinberger stated, “bookstores can 
effectively eliminate competition and control the market.  That is 
certainly not good news for the consumer.”  And, he went on to say, 
“Every sale of a computer or computer-related equipment by a tax 
exempt bookstore reduces the income tax revenue stream from the for- 
profit businesses.”

The hearings were called by Representative James Bilbray (D-Nevada), 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, to examine issues related to unfair 
competition. Although no specific legislation has yet been introduced 
to deal with this issue, CTIA’s Director of Public Policy, Andrew W. 
Dod, noted that it is important for the computer industry that “the 
Subcommittee continue to explore the issues related to unfair 
competition, in order to draft a possible legislative solution later 
this year.”

Technology Industry Association, contact Andrew Dod at (704) 845-8422.

Adds Voice to Digital Telephony Issue; Will Not Oppose New, Less 
Intrusive Legislation</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill. — In recognition of the legitimate needs of law 
enforcement agencies, the Computing Technology Industry Association 
(CompTIA) has indicated that it will not oppose the new, less 
intrusive Digital Telephony legislation introduced by Sen. Patrick 
Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.).  Historically, the 
computer industry has a strong record of cooperation with such 
agencies.  Support for this bill, however, hinges on the current 
limitations and privacy protections included in the present version 
remaining in tact as the legislation proceeds through the Congress, 
according to Andrew Dod, CompTIA’s Director of Public Policy.

Originally, Dod explained, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) 
had sought to require all communications and computer systems, 
including private networks, to be re-engineered and redesigned to 
facilitate interception of private messages (in an authorized, lawful 
wiretap).  The FBI’s proposal would have required the redesign or 
expensive alteration of: all PCs; local area networks in all 
businesses; public e-mail systems; all telephone switches; PBXs; high 
speed networks; and radio-based and cellular communications, as well 
as several other types of communications equipment.

Of particular importance, Dod stressed, is that the costs for the 
redesign and alteration would have been borne by those impacted by the 
legislation, not by the government. CompTIA’s Director of Public 
Policy also noted that previous drafts of the Digital Telephony 
legislation were vigorously opposed by the Association. In addition to 
the security and privacy issues raised by the original version of the 
bill, CompTIA was concerned about the adverse impact that such 
legislation would have on international trade.  It is likely, Dod 
declared, that consumers would have doubts about purchasing U.S.-made 
equipment that essentially contained a “trap door” through which the 
FBI could easily enter.

According to Dod, the Leahy/Edwards bill is more narrow in scope than 
the previous FBI proposals.  For example, it does not apply to online 
communication and information services such as Internet providers, 
CompuServe, AOL, Prodigy and BBSs.  And, it also excludes private 
networks, PBXs and facilities that only interconnect 
telecommunications carriers or private networks.  In this way, Dod 
said, the bill satisfies CompTIA’s concerns about the impact on 
manufacturers of PCs and others who maintain and operate private 
networks, as well as the likely adverse impact on international trade.

Further, the Leahy/Edwards bill includes four important provisions and 
several new privacy protections that were not in previous 
FBI-sponsored proposals.  The new bill would:  a) allow the public to 
have access to information relating to the implementation of the bill; 
b) let industry define technical requirements and standards rather 
than the Attorney General; c) recognize that certain services may be 
untappable regardless of efforts to accommodate surveillance needs; 
and d) authorize $500 million to reimburse telecommunications carriers 
for bringing their networks into compliance with the bill. New privacy 
protections include: 1) expanded protection for transactional records; 
2) new protection for location-specific information available in 
cellular, PCS and other advanced networks; 3) no preclusion against 
the use of encryption; 4) law enforcement is precluded from having 
automated remote surveillance capability; and 5) wiretap access 
methods adopted must protect the privacy and security of each user’s 
communication.

During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, the 
FBI digital telephony bill, tax fairness, fair competition, and the 
Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure that 
the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

Fairness in Interstate Sales</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Computing Technology Industry Association, 
whose members recorded $50.5 billion in combined sales last year, has 
declared its support for the “Tax Fairness for Main Street Business 
Act of 1994.” Introduced by Senator Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), the bill 
would authorize states to require any mail order business doing more 
than $3 million in annual sales or whose sales into any given state 
exceed $100,000 to collect and remit sales taxes to the state that is 
the final location to which the seller ships or delivers merchandise.

Currently, computer resellers and other ‘main street’ businesses are 
at a competitive disadvantage because they are required to collect 
taxes on the goods they sell – while mail order companies are not 
required to do so. For example, Andrew Dod, CTIA’s Director of Public 
Policy, points out, “if a state sales tax rate is 7 percent, computer 
resellers are automatically at a 7 percent price disadvantage when 
compared to mail order companies. Passage of the Bumpers Bill would 
ensure a more level playing field for computer resellers and other 
‘main street’ businesses.”

Senator Bumpers noted in his introductory statement that the bill does 
not impose any new taxes, but instead improves the collection of 
existing state and local taxes. Dod noted that, according to a 1992 
report in State Tax Notes, the estimated uncollected taxes on 
interstate mail order sales for 1992 could have added $3.3 billion to 
state coffers.

Representative of the strong support that the bill has in the computer 
reseller community is Kenneth Krich, President and CEO of 
ComputerWare, which employs 160 people in nine stores in Northern 
California. Says Krich, “Profit margins in the highly competitive 
computer reseller business are razor thin. Mail order companies have 
garnered significant market share, in part, because they are not 
required to collect sales taxes from their out of state customers. As 
new technologies proliferate and more computer purchases are made via 
the telephone, television or computer modem, the inequality of the 
current system will worsen. An eroding retail customer base ultimately 
means less revenues to states to pay for education, roads and crime 
prevention.”

The Bumpers Bill, which has bipartisan support, is in the Senate 
Finance Committee. The Senate Small Business Committee is scheduled to 
hold a hearing on the Bumpers Bill on April 13, 1994.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill. — With a longstanding history of championing 
professionalism and ethical business practices, the Computing 
Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) has announced its support 
for a rating system for all forms of interactive software games, 
including video games and computer-based software games.  The 
Association believes that all parents and other consumers should be 
accurately advised of the content of the games they intend to 
purchase.

“The rewards of taking the lead in this area far outnumber those of 
plodding along with the crowd,” commented CompTIA’s Director of Public 
Policy, Andrew Dod.  “Unless we in the computer industry take a 
leadership role and regulate ourselves, it is likely that certain 
members of the Congress will pursue legislation and impose a rating 
system on us.” Dod noted that Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and 
Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) held several hearings over the past year that 
focused on the rights of parents and other consumers to be informed 
about a game’s content.  The Senators made their intentions clear and 
requested that a rating system be operational by the 1994 holiday 
season.

Toward that end, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) helped form 
the Computer Games Rating Working Group (CGR Working Group), a 
coalition of companies and associations that represents nearly 3,000 
developers and distributors of personal computer software.  This past 
July, the CGR Working Group proposed a rating system  based on the 
policy outlines of Sens. Lieberman and Kohl.  However, at the same 
time, several video game companies separately created the Interactive 
Digital Software Association (IDSA) and proposed a second, different 
rating system.

Despite good faith efforts by both groups, no agreement to combine the 
different rating systems has been reached, CompTIA’s Public Policy 
Director Andrew Dod stated.  At issue, Dod explained, is IDSA’s 
intention to retain ownership of the trademarks of the ratings icons 
and the process by which ratings are determined.  For any rating 
system to be effective, CompTIA believes that it must be managed by an 
independent body, which is not controlled by any particular industry 
association.

Because a trade association exists to serve its members’ interests, 
Dod noted, merely “insulating” the ratings body within a group would 
undermine the validity of the rating system, create the appearance of 
favoritism, and potentially jeopardize its acceptance by consumers.  
For these reasons, Dod said, CompTIA favored the CGR Working Group’s 
establishment of a separate corporation, called the Recreational 
Software Advisory Council (RSAC), to manage the rating system.

Dod went on to say that there are also concerns about the manner in 
which the IDSA would collect information from software publishers and 
on which the ratings would be based.  IDSA’s plan calls for using 
selected story boards, chosen by software publishers. RSAC’s process 
includes a detailed questionnaire that addresses the entire content of 
the game, as well as a disclosure statement that attests to the 
truthfulness of the answers and acknowledges penalties for misleading 
answers.

While CompTIA believes that the process spelled out by the RSAC is 
objective and will result in more accurate ratings on games, the 
Association understands that resellers will have to deal with two 
different sets of ratings icons.  “In any case, the Association 
encourages its reseller members to sell only games that carry a rating 
and to comply fully with CompTIA’s Code of Ethics,” Dod declared.

RSAC has developed the following ratings categories for video and 
computer-based software games:  violence, nudity/sex and language. 
During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues, such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, a 
software ratings system, tax fairness, fair competition, and the 
Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure that 
the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Computing Technology Industry Association 
announced its support of pending legislation that would amend the 
Export Administration Act (EAA) and relax export controls on software 
with encryption capabilities. According to Andrew Dod, CTIA’s Director 
of Public Policy, current controls threaten the market position of 
computer hardware and software manufacturers internationally. “Prompt 
action is needed so that U.S. companies can effectively compete with 
computer vendors in foreign countries that have less restrictive 
export controls,” Dod said. The market for software with encryption 
capabilities – which protects computer data against unauthorized 
disclosure, theft or alteration – is estimated at between $6 billion 
and $9 billion annually.

Nathan Morton, Chairman of the Board of CTIA and President of 
Dallas-based Open Environment, commented, “A realistic analysis of the 
current situation clearly demonstrates how U.S. companies are being 
locked out of competing in this specific, but growing, market not by 
artificial trade barriers of foreign countries but by artificial 
barriers in the U.S. CTIA supports Rep. Cantwell’s efforts because of 
the balanced and reasoned approach she has taken to promote trade 
while still protecting the national security.”

Introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), H.R. 3627 would amend the 
EAA by eliminating the need for export licenses for mass marketed 
software programs with encryption capabilities, except for those 
programs specifically designed for military use. In addition, the bill 
allows the government to deny an export license for any software if 
there is substantial evidence that it will be diverted or modified for 
military use or by terrorists or re-exported without the necessary 
U.S. authorization. Controls will  remain in effect on embargoed 
countries and on countries in which there are concerns about terrorist 
activities.

National security concerns prompted the enactment of export controls 
on software with encryption capabilities shortly after World War II; 
and they continued into the Cold War era. However, in today’s global 
economy, those concerns have nearly vanished. Further, the export 
controls have not been effective in restricting the availability of 
encryption abroad. In more than 20 countries, more than 200 mass 
market foreign commercial programs and products that offer encryption 
are being marketed. And, software with encryption capabilities can be 
purchased from most resellers in the U.S. These programs could be 
easily transferred abroad without being detected by the government.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of 3,000 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, software 
publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission is to

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Lombard, Ill. — In its ongoing efforts to monitor and take positions 
on public policy issues that critically affect the health of the 
computer industry or its various segments, The Computing Technology 
Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer Industry 
Association) announced that it actively supports the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). As an association representing more than 
3,000 leading companies from all sectors of the computer industry, 
CTIA believes that NAFTA will significantly benefit the industry in 
several ways, including the areas of tariffs, intellectual property, 
investment and services. Therefore, CTIA strongly urges Congress to 
approve NAFTA.

Tariffs 

NAFTA focuses on reducing the high Mexican tariffs now being 
collected on computers and computer parts. Computers and computer 
parts are currently subject to Mexican tariffs of 10%, 15%, and 20%, 
while the U.S. tariffs on the same products are 0% and 3.9%. 
Elimination of these tariffs will help to level the business playing 
field and open up the Mexican market. This can increase the flow of 
exports to Mexico and allow our industry to compete even more 
successfully in Mexico, our nation’s third largest trading partner.

Intellectual Property 

In addition, NAFTA codifies and solidifies significant improvements to 
Mexican law that protect intellectual property, such as patents, 
trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Protecting intellectual 
property – which is of critical importance to the computer industry – 
is essential to our industry’s ability to compete internationally. The 
computer industry spends billions of dollars each year on research and 
development for new products and services. NAFTA would substantially 
curtail the misappropriation of intellectual property in Mexico.

Investment

In the investment arena, NAFTA removes significant barriers and 
prohibits discrimination against U.S. companies. It was only a few 
years ago that Mexico closed its borders to computer imports and 
required local manufacturing for access to the Mexican computer 
market. Further, the companies that chose to manufacture in Mexico 
were required to export from Mexico and to obtain minimum “local 
content” in manufacturing those products. NAFTA would prohibit import 
restrictions altogether, providing assurances of future market access 
for U.S. exports.

Services

Further, NAFTA expands on initiatives in the U.S./Canada Free Trade 
Agreement and the Uruguay Round discussions of GATT that provide for 
establishing rules governing trade in services. A significant portion 
of the computer industry’s revenues are dependent on the export of 
services. NAFTA will open up more opportunities for the export of 
telecommunications and data processing services, in particular.

In other news, John Venator, CTIA Executive Vice President and CEO, 
announced the appointment of Andrew Dod as the Association’s Director 
of Public Policy. Dod will represent CTIA before the U.S. Congress, 
state legislatures, and regulatory bodies. In addition, Dod is 
responsible for monitoring public policy issues, developing

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Lombard, Ill. — A Michigan reseller and CTIA member told the U.S. 
Senate Small Business Committee that current federal law, which 
effectively exempts mail-order companies from collecting sales taxes 
on sales to out-of-state residents, is unfair to both ‘main street’ 
businesses and state and local governments.

Jerry K. Engle, President of Computer Products and Resources, Inc., a 
MicroAge franchise in Grand Rapids, said, “Competition between ‘main 
street’ businesses, like mine, and mail-order companies is not on a 
level playing field.  My company is required by law to collect 4 
percent (Michigan) sales tax on products we sell.  Out of state 
mail-order companies are not. One need not be a mathematician to 
conclude that ‘main street’ businesses in Michigan are at a 4 percent 
price disadvantage to out-of-state mail-order companies right from the 
start.”

Engle was recently invited to testify by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), 
Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee and author of S. 1825, 
‘The Tax Fairness for Main Street Business Act of 1994.’ The bill 
would authorize states to require any mail-order company doing more 
than $3 million in annual sales or whose sales into any given state 
exceed $100,000 to collect and remit sales taxes to the state to which 
the merchandise is finally delivered.

State governments feel the pinch from the mail-order company 
exemption, too, Engle said. He estimated that his company had lost 
more than $2 million in large transaction sales to mail-order firms 
over the past three years.  If his company had closed those sales, 
Engle said, the State of Michigan would have collected approximately 
$80,000 in additional sales taxes.  In 1992, Michigan lost an 
estimated $93.9 million in uncollected sales tax revenue because of 
mail-order sales, Engle stated.  He pegged the potential lost revenue 
for all states in 1992 at approximately $3.3 billion.

“From that lost revenue, not one single textbook will be purchased.  
Not one teacher will be hired.  And, at the risk of sounding 
self-serving, not one public school classroom or library computer 
system will be installed to hook into the often discussed information 
superhighway,” Engle told the Senate Committee.  “Nor will any of that 
lost revenue ever be allocated to hire another police officer to work 
the beat; to fund a substance abuse prevention program; or to initiate 
any early intervention programs for at-risk youth.”

Engle is a member of the Computing Technology Industry Association, 
which has lobbied in support of the proposed bill.  The Computing 
Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer 
Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit association of

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill. — In an effort to counteract any negative impact on the 
computer industry, the Computing Technology Industry Association 
(CompTIA) today filed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief 
with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of a petition for the court to 
hear the case of Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC) vs. 
Instructional Systems, Inc. (ISI) and Deborah T. Poritz, Attorney 
General of the State of New Jersey.  The case before the Court 
addresses a Commerce Clause issue, relating to the power of states to 
regulate interstate commerce.  CompTIA is a national not-for-profit 
trade association representing more than 6,150 companies from all 
segments of the computer industry, including manufacturers, 
distributors, resellers and service companies.

In filing the brief, the Association urged the U.S. Supreme Court to 
hear this particular New Jersey  case because of its immediate impact 
on interstate commerce and computer industry distribution issues.  At 
stake is a particular Commerce Clause issue; whether or not a state 
may apply its franchise laws to prohibit commercial transactions that 
occur wholly outside the state's borders and prevent out-of-state 
suppliers, potentially forever, from changing their distribution 
practices in other states.  Explains CompTIA’s Director of Public 
Policy Andrew Dod, “The case addresses whether New Jersey should have 
the authority to regulate the distribution practices of a California 
company in states outside of New Jersey.”  (A summary of the details 
of the case is attached to this release.)

Speaking on behalf of the Association, Barbara Faucett, CompTIA's 
Chairman said, “Our Association believes that to allow the Third 
Circuit Court’s decision to stand could have a significant and lasting 
negative impact on our entire industry.”  Faucett went on to say, “The 
relevance of the case to our members centers on whether one state can 
have the power to dictate, regulate or control the distribution and 
selling practices of suppliers located in other states.”  Faucett is 
Executive Director of LMB Microcomputers in Indianapolis, IN, a 
solutions-oriented computer reseller that specializes in desktop 
consulting and support services, training, graphics and media 
integration, as well as hardware, software and networking sales.

Echoing these remarks, Robert Powell, a member of CompTIA's Board and 
the Public Policy Committee that brought this case to the Board's 
attention, said, “If the lower court's decision stands, my filing 
cabinet may be full of contracts that mean something totally different 
than what parties think they mean.  That's not good for the industry.” 
Powell continued, “When we looked at the facts in this case and the 
law as it has been interpreted by the courts, we quickly reached 
consensus that to file the brief was in the best interests of the 
entire channel.”  Powell is Vice President of Complete Computing, a 
MicroAge affiliate in Little Rock, AR.

Dennis Hayes, Chairman of CompTIA's Public Policy Committee and 
President of Hayes Microcomputer Products in Atlanta, GA, said, “The 
channel demands flexibility from manufacturers, distributors and 
resellers.  We are all driven by new technologies that often require 
changes in distribution practices.  For one state to hold suppliers 
and vendors in other states hostage promotes the type of inefficiency 
of distribution that is in direct opposition to the efficient and 
profitable workings of our channel.”

Specifically, the brief focuses on the extraterritorial application of 
the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act.  Director of Public Policy Dod 
said, “Our brief was narrowly drafted to address only the power of New 
Jersey to apply its franchise statute on companies doing business in 
other states.  We did not feel it was appropriate to address any other 
issue relating to the existence or lack of existence of a franchise in 
this particular case.”

Faucett, stressing the value of an effective public policy effort 
within the Association  said, “CompTIA has and will continue to 
monitor the political landscape to address issues that affect our 
industry.  Whether it is testifying before Congress, consulting with 
regulatory agencies or filing a brief with the Supreme Court, CompTIA 
will strive – on behalf of its entire membership – to be a strong and 
active voice heard by all levels of government.”

During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues, such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, a 
software ratings system, the FBI digital telephony bill, tax fairness, 
fair competition, and the Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, 
CompTIA has helped ensure that the effects of such legislation and 
regulations on computer industry manufacturers, distributors and 
resellers is well known.

Curiae Brief, please contact Andrew Dod, CompTIA’s Director of Public

Details of the Case
INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS, INC. 
V. COMPUTER CURRICULUM CORPORATION
and DEBORAH T. PORITZ, ATTORNEY GENERAL
OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC) is a Delaware corporation 
headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.  It produces and markets an integrated 
learning system that uses computer technology to teach and monitor a 
student's progress in subjects such as math, reading, language and 
computer science education.

From 1974 to 1989, Instructional Systems, Inc. (ISI), a New Jersey 
corporation with its primary place of business in New Jersey, served 
as the exclusive distributor of products sold by CCC in the Northeast, 
this pursuant to a series of written agreements between the parties.

In 1984, the parties signed a "Reseller Agreement."  Under the 
contract, CCC appointed ISI as the exclusive "reseller" of CCC 
products to certain categories of customers in the following states:  
CT, DE, ME, MD, MA, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VT, and the District of Columbia.  
The contract provided that the agreement shall remain in effect until 
1989.

In 1988, ISI proposed to CCC that they extend the agreement for one 
more year.  CCC declined to do so on the grounds that CCC believed 
that ISI was spending a disproportionate amount of time selling in 
only three states: NJ, NY, and MA.  CCC believed that ISI was ignoring 
the other states.

Instead of allowing the 1984 Reseller Agreement to lapse when it 
expired, CCC offered ISI a new two year contract for the three states 
in which ISI had its major sales activity: NJ, NY, and MA.  CCC 
decided to take over the marketing of its products in the former ISI 
territory.

In August 1989, the parties agreed to a contract in which ISI would 
continue to sell in NJ, NY, and MA and CCC would begin to sell in the 
remaining states.  The same day that ISI executed the contract with 
CCC, ISI filed suit against CCC.  The complaint argued that the 1984 
Reseller Agreement contemplated renewal, that CCC had coerced ISI into 
signing the new contract, and that CCC had violated the New Jersey 
Franchise Practices Act (Act) by imposing unreasonable standards of 
performance on ISI.

CCC's response argued that if the Act could be used to enjoin it from 
terminating ISI's purported franchise in states other than NJ, the Act 
would violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  CCC 
argued that New Jersey has an interest in regulating only those 
franchise terminations that occur within it borders and has no 
jurisdiction in applying its law to other states.

New Jersey courts found that its law could be applied in this case, 
concluding that the state in which the franchisee is located has a 
significant policy interest in governing the relations between the 
parties.  The New Jersey courts also determined that the law of New 
Jersey would apply rather than the contractually agreed state law of 
California.

Washington</H1></CENTER><PRE>


For many within the channel, Washington is a place where insignificant 
issues are debated and faceless “bureaucrats” enforce burdensome 
regulations.  But, more often than we dare to admit, many of the 
issues Congress addresses will have a direct impact on future market 
opportunities. 

The most recent victory for our industry may, over the next several 
years, be worth $80 billion in new consumer spending. Lobbying by 
members of the Association’s Public Policy Committee and CompTIA’s 
Director of Public Policy, Andrew Dod, helped win passage of the 
Bryant Amendment, as part of the telecommunications deregulation 
legislation.  

Notes Dod, the question at issue is:  should the seven Baby Bells 
(Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs) — without first having 
to establish a separate arm’s-length affiliate — be allowed to offer 
information services and become vertical VARs; be allowed to 
manufacture, distribute and resell telecommunications-related computer 
equipment; and be permitted to compete head-to-head with the reseller 
channel? Dod consulted with a variety of industry executives and 
lobbyists about the absence of “separate affiliate” language in the 
House telecom bill.  

Without this language, Dod explained, an RBOC could compete 
head-to-head with the reseller channel in both products and services, 
as well as subsidize its efforts with financial, information and 
technology resources.  The channel would have a difficult time 
competing on such on an unlevel playing field, Dod states. On May 20, 
CompTIA executives and members of the Georgia High Tech Alliance met 
with Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, for a briefing on his vision 
for renewing America. Following that meeting, Dennis Hayes, chairman 
and CEO of Hayes Microcomputer Products (Atlanta) and Chairman of 
CompTIA’s Public Policy Committee, asked why the House 
telecommunications legislation did not include any “separate 
affiliate” language.  

Gingrich responded that he was not aware that the affiliate language 
was so important and requested that a one-page position outline be 
prepared by May 22, for delivery to the Commerce Committee leadership. 
On behalf of the Association, Dod and Hayes presented a simple 
argument to Gingrich: “Because of their unique market position, the 
RBOCs could engage in potentially anti- competitive conduct in three 
particular areas if “separate affiliate” requirements are not included 
in the final legislation.  

Because of the RBOCs unique position, the areas of concern are:  
Financial Subsidies, Information Subsidies and Technology Subsidies. 
According to Dod, the concern centers around protecting CompTIA 
members from the cross-subsidization of resources from the phone 
holding company to one of the RBOCs new competitive business ventures. 
Rep. John Bryant (D-TX), a Commerce Committee member, authored the 
“separate affiliate” amendment which, after intense lobbying and 
several changed Republican votes, won by a vote of 29-15. 

What did the Association and the industry win  and where do we go now? 
Assuming that both the full House and Senate pass their bills, the 
Conference Committee will be charged with ironing out the details and 
a final compromise, says Dod. In the shifting political sands of 
Washington, Dod explains, the Association and the industry have won 
the right to fight again for this issue in the Conference Committee. 
Sums up Dod, “It’s a modified, limited, temporary victory on one vote 
on one provision in one bill in one House on one day in May.  And, 
more than $80 billion was at stake.” 

The mechanics of lobbying in Washington rarely excite the passions of 
non-political professionals within the channel in the computer 
industry.  With legislation that will determine where and how some $80 
billion will be spent, however, Dod suspects that this will change. To 
join the fight for a level playing field for the channel, call

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill. — With a longstanding history of championing 
professionalism and ethical business practices, the Computing 
Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) has announced its support 
for a rating system for all forms of interactive software games, 
including video games and computer-based software games.  The 
Association believes that all parents and other consumers should be 
accurately advised of the content of the games they intend to 
purchase.

“The rewards of taking the lead in this area far outnumber those of 
plodding along with the crowd,” commented CompTIA’s Director of Public 
Policy, Andrew Dod.  “Unless we in the computer industry take a 
leadership role and regulate ourselves, it is likely that certain 
members of the Congress will pursue legislation and impose a rating 
system on us.” Dod noted that Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and 
Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) held several hearings over the past year that 
focused on the rights of parents and other consumers to be informed 
about a game’s content.  The Senators made their intentions clear and 
requested that a rating system be operational by the 1994 holiday 
season.

Toward that end, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) helped form 
the Computer Games Rating Working Group (CGR Working Group), a 
coalition of companies and associations that represents nearly 3,000 
developers and distributors of personal computer software.  This past 
July, the CGR Working Group proposed a rating system  based on the 
policy outlines of Sens. Lieberman and Kohl.  However, at the same 
time, several video game companies separately created the Interactive 
Digital Software Association (IDSA) and proposed a second, different 
rating system.

Despite good faith efforts by both groups, no agreement to combine the 
different rating systems has been reached, CompTIA’s Public Policy 
Director Andrew Dod stated.  At issue, Dod explained, is IDSA’s 
intention to retain ownership of the trademarks of the ratings icons 
and the process by which ratings are determined.  For any rating 
system to be effective, CompTIA believes that it must be managed by an 
independent body, which is not controlled by any particular industry 
association.

Because a trade association exists to serve its members’ interests, 
Dod noted, merely “insulating” the ratings body within a group would 
undermine the validity of the rating system, create the appearance of 
favoritism, and potentially jeopardize its acceptance by consumers.  
For these reasons, Dod said, CompTIA favored the CGR Working Group’s 
establishment of a separate corporation, called the Recreational 
Software Advisory Council (RSAC), to manage the rating system.

Dod went on to say that there are also concerns about the manner in 
which the IDSA would collect information from software publishers and 
on which the ratings would be based.  IDSA’s plan calls for using 
selected story boards, chosen by software publishers. RSAC’s process 
includes a detailed questionnaire that addresses the entire content of 
the game, as well as a disclosure statement that attests to the 
truthfulness of the answers and acknowledges penalties for misleading 
answers.

While CompTIA believes that the process spelled out by the RSAC is 
objective and will result in more accurate ratings on games, the 
Association understands that resellers will have to deal with two 
different sets of ratings icons.  “In any case, the Association 
encourages its reseller members to sell only games that carry a rating 
and to comply fully with CompTIA’s Code of Ethics,” Dod declared.

RSAC has developed the following ratings categories for video and 
computer-based software games:  violence, nudity/sex and language. 
During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues, such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, a 
software ratings system, tax fairness, fair competition, and the 
Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure that 
the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Computing Technology Industry Association 
announced its support of pending legislation that would amend the 
Export Administration Act (EAA) and relax export controls on software 
with encryption capabilities. According to Andrew Dod, CTIA’s Director 
of Public Policy, current controls threaten the market position of 
computer hardware and software manufacturers internationally. “Prompt 
action is needed so that U.S. companies can effectively compete with 
computer vendors in foreign countries that have less restrictive 
export controls,” Dod said. The market for software with encryption 
capabilities – which protects computer data against unauthorized 
disclosure, theft or alteration – is estimated at between $6 billion 
and $9 billion annually.

Nathan Morton, Chairman of the Board of CTIA and President of 
Dallas-based Open Environment, commented, “A realistic analysis of the 
current situation clearly demonstrates how U.S. companies are being 
locked out of competing in this specific, but growing, market not by 
artificial trade barriers of foreign countries but by artificial 
barriers in the U.S. CTIA supports Rep. Cantwell’s efforts because of 
the balanced and reasoned approach she has taken to promote trade 
while still protecting the national security.”

Introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), H.R. 3627 would amend the EAA by 
eliminating the need for export licenses for mass marketed software 
programs with encryption capabilities, except for those programs 
specifically designed for military use. In addition, the bill allows 
the government to deny an export license for any software if there is 
substantial evidence that it will be diverted or modified for military 
use or by terrorists or re-exported without the necessary U.S. 
authorization. Controls will  remain in effect on embargoed countries 
and on countries in which there are concerns about terrorist 
activities.

National security concerns prompted the enactment of export controls 
on software with encryption capabilities shortly after World War II; 
and they continued into the Cold War era. However, in today’s global 
economy, those concerns have nearly vanished. Further, the export 
controls have not been effective in restricting the availability of 
encryption abroad. In more than 20 countries, more than 200 mass 
market foreign commercial programs and products that offer encryption 
are being marketed. And, software with encryption capabilities can be 
purchased from most resellers in the U.S. These programs could be 
easily transferred abroad without being detected by the government.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of 3,000 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, software 
publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission is to 
foster high levels of professional competence and business ethics

members reached $50.5 billion in 1993. Total microcomputer sales in
