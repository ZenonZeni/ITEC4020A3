<h1>Hydrogen Energy</h1><p>
<p>
Hydrogen, as an energy carrier, is anticipated to join electricity to 
become
the foundation for a national sustainable energy system using renewable 
energy.
Hydrogen can be made safe, environmentally friendly, and versatile, and 
it has
many potential energy uses, including powering nonpolluting vehicles, 
heating
homes and offices, and fueling aircraft.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Energy from renewable sources--sunlight, wind, hydropower, and 
biomass--must be
stored and transported so it is available when and where it is needed.
Hydrogen potentially could be produced using renewable sources, then 
stored and
used later in homes, factories, businesses, vehicles, and airplanes.<p>

Hydrogen can be produced from water using electricity, in a process 
called
electrolysis. Production is also possible from direct sunlight acting on 
water
or biological organisms and from organisms that create hydrogen in the 
dark
from carbon monoxide and water.  These processes are all subjects of 
current
research and development programs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Most of the domestic hydrogen used today is produced from fossil 
fuels--natural
gas or petroleum derivatives.  The major markets for hydrogen are in the
petrochemical and fertilizer industries.<p>

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration uses hydrogen to propel 
its
space shuttles into orbit and to provide all of the shuttles' electric 
power
from on-board fuel cells.  Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to 
generate
electricity; the fuel cells' exhaust--pure water--is used for drinking 
water by
the crew.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages and Opportunities</h2>
The production of hydrogen from renewable electricity and from biomass 
could
reduce our dependence on imported petroleum.  If the U.S. Department of 
Energy
(DOE) reaches its goal of hydrogen energy providing 10% of the total U.S.

energy consumption by 2025, our dependence on oil imports could be cut in

half.<p>

Hydrogen can be combined with gasoline, ethanol, methanol, or natural 
gas; just
adding 5% hydrogen to the gasoline-air mixture in an internal combustion 
engine
(ICE) could reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 30% to 40%.  An ICE 
converted to
burn pure hydrogen produces only water and minor amounts of nitrogen 
oxides as
exhaust.<p>

California's new "zero-emission" standard for passenger
cars--requiring that 2% of new cars sold in the state be nonpolluting by
1998--could be met by electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells, 
or
hybrids powered by hydrogen-fueled ICEs and batteries or flywheels.
Manufacturing fuel cells to meet the potential demand could add 70,000 
new jobs
to the state.<p>

Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of renewable sources and has many 
uses
in our economy.  Because of the versatility of production methods and end 
use,
wide-spread hydrogen energy use will create significant benefits to the
agricultural, manufacturing, transportation, and service sectors of the 
U.S.
economy.<p>
<p>
<h2>DOE Projects and Initiatives</h2>
Large-scale use of renewable hydrogen energy requires advances in 
production,
storage, and utilization technologies.  Improvements in stationary and 
on-board
hydrogen storage technologies are necessary to meet mass market energy 
demands;
transportation requires special tanks or pipelines; and some advances are 
still
required to make vehicles powered by fuel cells practical.  Research and
development programs encouraged by DOE are concentrating in all of these 
key
areas.<p>
