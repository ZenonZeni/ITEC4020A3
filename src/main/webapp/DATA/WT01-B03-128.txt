<h3><a href="Oct_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Relative Strength of Benham 2020"><b>Relative Strength of
Benham 2020</b> </a></h3>

<p>Last month our insert mentioned the weakening of the overall
stock market as indicated by the <i>Relative Strength Index. </i>This
month I would like to tell you a little about how this index
works. There are at least two methods of calculating
&#147;Relative Strength&#148;. The first type is a more literal
approach to the term Relative Strength in that it compares the
performance of one stock or fund with the performance of another
stock, fund or index. This comparison gives you its Relative
Strength (i.e. which fund is stronger). This is not the Relative
Strength about which I am speaking. </p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) I am using was developed by
J. Welles Wilder, Jr. primarily for use in trading options but
has been adapted for use in Mutual Funds. It is called a momentum
index and it is calculated by determining an exponential moving
average of upticks versus an average of the downticks. Generally,
this is calculated over a relatively short period of time like 14
days. When graphed this index is plotted on a range of zero to
100% with lines at the 30%, 50%, and 70% marks. When the index
crosses above the 70% line it is said to be overbought (i.e. too
high) and when it crosses below the 30% mark it is oversold (i.e.
too low). </p>

<p>In the Benham 2020 chart we have the price chart on top and
the corresponding Relative Strength chart below. As we can see
from this chart occasionally a fund can remain in the overbought
range for quite some time as indicated by the &#147;A&#148;. Just
prior to the &#147;A&#148; circle corresponds with the buy signal
generated by the MIP for May of this year. Technically, we
wouldn't count this as a sell signal until it dropped out of the
high strength area in early June. </p>

<p>Although the MIP generates its signals approximately six to
twelve months in advance the Relative Strength index works in
days rather than months. </p>

<p>Prior to the &#147;A&#148; zone the RSI never really generated
a good buy signal at all. It simply stayed in the upper half,
although the MIP had generated a buy. At point &#147;B&#148; I
published our first issue and issued a buy signal for 2020 since
the MIP still had a couple of months to go. I didn't expect the
all out buy generated at point &#147;C&#148; since BTTTX had been
in the upper half all year. &#147;C&#148; occurred so quickly
that a monthly newsletter is unable to work with it at all. At
point &#147;D&#148; both the MIP and the RSI generated a sell for
2020 and a strong confirmation has occurred at &#147;E&#148; (by
crossing above and then below the 70% line). So although 2020 has
moved above our sell point, it is in the high risk zone and not
worth the risk for such a few points. It is much too high to
warrant remaining in Bonds. </p>

<h3><a href="Oct_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Relative Strength of Invesco Strategic Gold"><b>Relative
Strength of Invesco Strategic Gold</b> </a></h3>

<p><img src="../images/Oct_952.gif"
alt="Invesco Strategic Gold RSI" align="bottom" width="455"
height="368"></p>

<p>Now let us look at the Gold side of the equation. On the
Invesco Strategic Gold Chart we see a strong buy signal in early
February at point &#147;A&#148;. The MIP was flat through March
and issued a small buy signal for the period of March through
May. By combining the two signals (MIP &amp; RSI) we would have
bought at the end of February. The tricky part comes when we get
a sell signal at the end of March. Although we have seen a nice
gain the MIP says we still have a month to go. Once again the MIP
proves correct and we get another sell at the end of April at
point &#147;B&#148; as it crosses below the 70% line. This
corresponds with the MIP sell and the Benham 2020 Bond price
explosion on the previous chart. Line &#147;C&#148; is in a sharp
rise which is not confirmed by the RSI in circle &#147;B&#148;.
Another confirmation of the sell signal. At point I was writing
the August issue trying to estimate the best switch point and
expecting the drop to point &#147;E&#148; to occur much more
quickly. </p>

<p>So, although subsequently September saw a sell signal for
Bonds, the Buy signal for Gold did not occur until early October
with a confirming Sell in Bonds. As I said in the August issue
when I issued the switch signal, I would prefer to be a little
early rather than a little late. </p>

<p>Although, It may be a little nerve racking at first until the
rise materializes often the first leg up is the most explosive
and has the biggest gain (as we saw last month in my currency
article and as we can see in the May price of BTTTX). We now have
confirmation that we are on the right track, so just hold on (or
for you procrastinators, jump aboard) for the ride. At this point
Bonds are still a sell and Gold is still a Buy. At this point the
best buy will occur as the Relative Strength turns up again.
Which I hope, for the sake of all our ulcers, will occur before
you receive this. </p>

<p>This difficulty in timing illustrates the need for more up to
the minute advice , such as a weekly hotline. I am currently torn
between resisting the extra work, expense and time limitations
involved and the need to provide more timely advice. </p>

<h2><a href="Oct_95.htm#In This Issue . . ." name="RSI Microsoft"><strong>RSI
Microsoft</strong></a></h2>

<h3><img src="../images/Oct_953.gif" alt="Microsoft RSI"
align="bottom" width="564" height="432"></h3>

<h3><b>Relative Strength of Microsoft</b> </h3>

<p>Microsoft has shown great strength this year by remaining in
the upper half. The closest thing to a buy signal occurred at
point &#147;A&#148; in late January and another one now in
October at point &#147;B&#148;. Unfortunately, if we were using
strictly Relative Strength we would not get many good signals for
Microsoft. The blow off in July was signaled by being in the
overbought range but so was March, April, and May . If the rise
in October - November does not exceed the peaks in August and
September that would be a bad signal. So we need a close above
the 99 3/8 close of 8/22 or at least above 97 5/8 to keep the
rally alive and preferably above the July high of 109. Today
10/24 the close was 97 1/2 if it retreats from here without
closing above 97 5/8 that will be a bad sign and we will close
our MSFT position. If, however, as we expect, it closes above 99
3/8, all systems are go we would continue to hold on until the
Relative Strength crosses above 70% and then turns below. </p>

<h2><a href="Oct_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Figures Don't Lie?">Figures Don't Lie?</a></h2>

<p>There is an old saying, &#147;Figures don't lie but Liars
figure&#148;. Most of us have come to the conclusion at one time
or another that statistics can be made to say most anything we
want them to. Simply by presenting the numbers in the right light
or by looking at the right portion of the data we can skew the
results. This is one reason that it is very important for us to
be sure that the source of our CPI data is accurate. A couple of
months ago, we noted that the government was reporting a .2% rise
in the &#147;seasonally adjusted&#148; CPI data while the actual
data was telling us there was a .2% decline. </p>

<p>Now, according to the October 2nd <i>Wall Street Journal, </i>congress
is coming to the conclusion that &#147;<i>The consumer price
index... overstates the true increase of the cost of
living.&#148;</i> My personal guess would be that the opposite is
probably true since they are constantly tinkering here and there.
But if the above is any indication, the seasonal adjustments may
be the problem. </p>

<p><b>Congress is coming to the conclusion that </b><b><i>&#147;The
consumer price index... overstates the true increase of the cost
of living.&#148;</i></b> </p>

<p>However, Congress has its own reasons for wanting to lower the
CPI index, i.e. for every percent that the CPI drops it saves
billions in &#147;cost of living adjustments&#148; that are tied
into almost everything. With this in mind I sincerely doubt that
accuracy in reporting is their primary concern. I believe they
will probably vote to fudge the numbers as a much easier way to
cut the budget than cutting Social Security. Although CPI
adjustment will have the same effect, most people won't realize
it until they find their checks aren't going as far as they used
to. In addition CPI adjustment will also cut wage increases for
union and non-union workers whose contracts are tied to the CPI. </p>

<p>How this will affect our MIP calculations is uncertain at this
point. Probably, it will only create a temporary dislocation when
the change is actually put into effect. But if they phase it in
the dislocation could last longer. At this point I do not know
how they arrived at the conclusion that the CPI is off by 1% or
how they plan to correct it. Will they just subtract 1% from the
actual number? I doubt it. They probably will change the
composition of the index. Again! </p>

<p>I have heard it said that the only way we can get a true feel
for how much our cost of living is increasing is to keep track of
our own personal index. If I buy bread, milk, premium gasoline,
steak and lobster every week and you buy potato chips, beer,
regular gas, hamburger and cigarettes we have different costs of
living. But in addition to having different costs of living, our
cost of living may change at different rates. Generally speaking
our &#147;true cost of living&#148; is based upon what we buy
every month, i.e. food, gas, heat or A/C, rent or mortgage, etc.
While food and gas can change quite rapidly, generally,
electricity and our mortgage are quite stable (unless we move).
So our personal price index should be relatively stable but it
would be interesting to see how well it correlates to the
government's numbers. </p>

<p>An advisor once suggested that people should actually track
their personal CPI. We could make a list of items we buy
regularly and track their price monthly. I would be interested in
hearing from anyone who is doing that currently to see how it
relates to the government's CPI index. </p>

<p>Last month I warned you that the stock market looked weak and
that we should expect a flat to slightly down trend for the
September CPI numbers. Both have proven correct. The MIP is at
rock bottom. We are looking for a sharp upturn in the October
numbers due to be released Mid-November. Hopefully, gold will
begin it's upturn before then but it may wait for the CPI
release. I think these numbers will be a surprise to most
analysts who have begun to expect the steady decline we have seen
over the last several months. This up tick should last through
December-January and provide a nice profit in Gold, Gold Stocks
and Precious Metals Mutual Funds. This uptick may also correspond
with the lackluster performance in the overall stock market. If
that is the case, then we should expect the stock market to
rebound beginning in early 1996. However, these sharp increases
and declines should prove profitable for our switching portfolio
no matter which way the overall stock market goes.<b>CPI-U

<p>This Section is a new feature designed to give some basic
information about the Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) and the
overall market climate to New Investors or simply a quick
overview for you seasoned investors. Also this feature will tell
you what to do with any &#147;New Money&#148; you may have just
freed up. </p>

<p><b>Disaster Insurance-</b> A portion of your total portfolio
should be held in tangible assets not in paper. These should be
in your possession, well hidden, for times of emergency. These
are not for speculation and should be purchased during buy
signals for Gold Stocks and Gold Mutual Funds. Between Ten
percent (10%) of your total portfolio and one year's living
expenses should be in Gold and Silver coin. This is insurance
against personal and large scale disasters and bears a certain
cost (as does any insurance). In this case the cost is loss of
interest. If you fear possible Government confiscation (again)
you should hold collectable quality Gold coins (MS-60 or above),
preferably sealed and graded by PCGS. </p>

<p><b>The Basic Portfolio-</b> For simplicity this portfolio will
stay with the Benham Family. We have chosen Benham for two
reasons. 1) It has a good Gold Fund. 2) It has a long term Bond
Fund that is usually the most volatile (i.e. provides the
greatest upside potential during up moves) 3) It has several
alternatives for parking funds during periods of uncertainty. See
the following article for information on how to set up an account

<p><img src="../images/Oct_955.gif" alt="&quot;A&quot; Block"
align="bottom" width="112" height="110"> </p>

<p><b>Account.</b> The first step in the type of investing we are
recommending is opening up an account with The Benham Group. To
open an account you must complete and sign an application. To
receive an application you may call 1-800-331-8331 or
1-415-965-4274. If you prefer they can fill out your application
over the telephone and mail it to you for your signature. You may
not redeem shares until they have your completed application on
file. Benham Group representatives are available weekdays from
5:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. </p>

<p>To mail your application overnight and by special delivery
(e.g., Federal Express, Express Mail, Priority mail) mail should
be sent to their street address: 1665 Charleston Road, Mountain
View, California 94043. </p>

<p><img src="../images/Oct_956.gif" alt="&quot;B&quot; Block"
align="bottom" width="112" height="109"></p>

<p><b>Buy Shares.</b> The second step in our investment ABC's is
to buy shares. To buy shares by check you must have a minimum
initial investment of $1,000 with a minimum additional investment
of $100. Make your investment check payable to The Benham Group
and mail the check with your completed application to The Benham
Group, P.O. Box 7730, San Francisco, CA 94120-9853. </p>

<p>They will also accept checks drawn on foreign banks or foreign
branches of domestic banks and checks that are not drawn in U.S.
dollars (U.S. $100 minimum). The cost of collecting payment on
such checks will be yours. These costs can be great and time
consuming. </p>

<p>You may also buy shares by bank wire. If you wish to open an
account by bank wire, call 1-800-321-8321 or 1-415-965-4222 for
more information and an account number. </p>

<p>You may also set up an IRA with Benham. The minimum initial
investment is $1000 with additional minimum investments again
being $100. There is no maintenance fee. </p>

<p>You may also make periodic investments to your accounts by
automatic bank deposit. The minimum in this case is $25. Speak to
your representative to set up this authorized transferal. </p>

<p><img src="../images/Oct_957.gif" alt="&quot;C&quot; Block"
align="bottom" width="112" height="109"> </p>

<p><b>Change funds. </b>Up to four times a year you may need to
call Benham to exchange funds. You will need a minimum of $1000
in your account. You simply tell them, for example, that you wish
to exchange from Benham 2020 to the Benham Gold Equity Index
Fund. They will set up your account immediately for you over the
phone if you have not used the destination fund before. Right now
you should be in Gold Funds. Specifically for the basic fund this
would be Benham Gold Equity Index Fund. </p>

<p>By following the advice in Financial Trend Forecaster you can
make as much as 40% per year on your money&#151;maybe even more! </p>

<h3><b>Editor's Notes</b>: </h3>

<p>Another Positive Signal for Gold and Silver is their crossing
above their Moving Average Lines. As we can see in the
accompanying charts. </p>

<p>I know the last month has been difficult (I follow my own
advice) but don't panic out at the bottom! We are getting many
combined positive signals. </p>

<p>I have committed additional funds to buying at this point! </p>

<p>Remember, when it takes the most courage to buy is when you
ought to be buying! </p>

<p>Best wishes! I believe if you hang in there you will be
rewarded. </p>
