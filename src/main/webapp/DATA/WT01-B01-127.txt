<h2>CPJ staffer testifies on Cuba before Congress</h2>
<P>
As a result of CPJ&#146;s two-year campaign to help foster a free press in Cuba, Americas program coordinator Suzanne Bilello was asked to <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../../../news/cubtest.6.27.html">testify</A> before a June 27 Congressional hearing on human rights violations in Cuba.<P>

Bilello had just returned from Havana, where she was <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../../../news/cub6.21.html">interrogated and deported</A> after four days of meetings with representatives of the country&#146;s five independent news agencies. <P>

"These are journalists whose sole aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media and yet a comfortable distance from organized factions at home and abroad," she told members of the Congressional subcommittees on international relations and the Western hemisphere. "[They] face significant internal obstacles, including a lack of the most rudimentary supplies, inadequate financial resources and virtually no exposure to the workings of independent media. In addition, fax machines and modems are illegal unless authorized by the state."<P>

Bilello herself experienced some of the government&#146;s intimidation tactics when she was arrested in her Havana hotel room and interrogated by Cuban Interior Ministry and Immigration officials on June 19. "During the eight hours I was detained, I got a taste of the Kafkaesque ordeal that many independent journalists have experienced," Bilello told Congressional representatives. "All of my personal notebooks, phone lists, business cards, and personal letters the journalists had given to me to mail in the United States were confiscated." <P>

On June 20, Bilello was expelled from Cuba on charges of <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../../../news/cub6.21.html#fomenting rebellion">"fomenting rebellion" </A>--for meeting with independent Cuban journalists and bringing them modest gifts of supplies, such as pens and notebooks, and small donations for their news-gathering efforts from U.S. news organizations and other private sources.<P>

At the end of her testimony, Bilello submitted for the record a CPJ report on the plight of Cuba&#146;s independent journalists and a list of CPJ recommendations for U.S. policy toward Cuba.<P>
