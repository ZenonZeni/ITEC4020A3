Dole Says `Enough Is Enough,' Urges 7 To 10-Day CR

      Contending that "enough is enough," Senate Majority Leader
Dole today said Congress should pass a seven- to 10-day
continuing resolution to reopen the entire federal government. "I
think we've made our point," Dole told reporters, saying the
House and Senate should pass a "clean" CR lasting up to a week
and a half, while budget negotiations continue. "There are not
too many wealthy people working for the federal government," Dole
said, referring to employees who are not being paid. He said he
also is concerned that without immediate legislation, various
"expiring provisions" of federal law will prohibit some states
from providing certain services. He said, for example, some
states may not be able to send out unemployment checks.

      Dole said he would discuss the CR proposal with House
Speaker Gingrich later today. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader
Daschle said this afternoon Democrats would again attempt to
offer a clean CR in the Senate later today and that given Dole's
support, he hoped Gingrich would go along with the proposal. But
House members are likely to stick to their position that a CR
should only be passed as part of an overall budget deal, House
Appropriations Chairman Livingston told CongressDaily. "I
honestly don't believe that a straight CR would pass over here,"
he said, adding that he sympathizes with Dole's position. "I want
to get the government going," he said. A House Republican
leadership aide said, "The last time we gave [President Clinton]
a CR, he didn't even come to the table for a month, so it doesn't
give us much incentive to do it again."

      The aide said tonight's White House budget meeting is
expected to be the first time the negotiators try to resolve the
larger issues. "We'll see how serious they are," the aide said,
adding that decisions on whether the House tries to override
presidential vetoes of the Commerce-Justice-State, VA-HUD and
Interior appropriations bills depends -- in part -- on whether
the Clinton administration bargains in good faith. Livingston
agreed, saying, "The shape and content of the discussion will
have great bearing on what we do over the next few days." Clinton
early today met for two hours with his budget advisers to discuss
strategy for today's negotiating sessions, which could go late
into the evening, Press Secretary Michael McCurry said. When
asked if the president would support a CR that sends all federal
employees back to work without pay, McCurry said, "It's better
than nothing, but not much better than nothing."

      On a related front, the administration has barely started
to piece together the FY97 budget the president is supposed to
present to Congress by Feb. 5 because the final form of the FY96
budget is unknown. An administration official said the president
normally would be making final decisions on the FY97 budget this
time of the year if an FY96 budget were in place. Administration
budget officials need to know final figures for FY96
appropriations and any planned changes in entitlement spending
formulas before they can craft a new budget, the official said.

GOP Leaders To Meet Wed. On Proposed Telco Changes

      At a joint House and Senate leadership meeting scheduled
for Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Dole and House
Speaker Gingrich are expected to try to iron out a final
compromise on four or five outstanding issues in
telecommunications reform legislation, sources said today. The
issues include foreign ownership, price regulation, and broadcast
ownership. Spectrum sales, an issue Dole brought up again last
week, may also be raised, sources said. Optimistically, if the
leadership can settle these issues, the telecommunications
conference agreement could go to the House floor Thursday. It
could then be brought to a vote in the Senate on Friday or early
next week, sources said, while cautioning, "But we've all heard
that before."

      The most recent version of an agreement put together by the
four conference leaders dropped a provision that would have
relaxed foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. communications
firms. House Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee
Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, is working to reinstate the
provision, strongly opposed by Senate Commerce ranking member
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. The regional Bell operating companies
have sought "price regulation" of their services to replace the
current system of "rate of return" regulation, which caps the
amount of profits the RBOCs can earn. Also, some conferees want
to loosen broadcast ownership restrictions for the number of
properties held by one owner. And Dole has sought to charge
broadcasters for the purchase of spectrum as a revenue raiser.

House Panels Seeking Superfund Financing Alternatives

      With a rebate to private parties for Superfund cleanups a
target of fierce political attacks, the House Commerce and
Transportation and Infrastructure panels are seeking alternatives
for financing the program, panel sources said. Among the
proposals are further exemptions from liability for new classes
of Superfund sites, a Transportation and Infrastructure source
added. Transportation and Infrastructure Water Resources and
Environment Subcommittee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., last
month said the rebate -- called the retroactive liability
discount -- will be dropped from the Superfund reform legislation
he is sponsoring with Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. "There is general
agreement that it won't survive," Boehlert said.

      Democrats and environmental groups derided the RLD plan as
a "pay-the-polluter" giveaway and a costly new entitlement.
Boehlert said Democrats were able to target the RLD to portray
the Superfund legislation as an attack on the environment. As
approved by Oxley's subcommittee in November, the RLD would cover
50 percent of the cleanup cost at Superfund sites and would be
paid out of the Superfund trust fund. Bill sponsors proposed the
RLD as an alternative to exempting from cleanup liability
altogether sites polluted before the Superfund law went into
effect in 1980. Oxley said repealing retroactive liability would
be too expensive, and that the RLD would reduce liability
litigation and get more money into cleanups.

      To replace the RLD, the committees are considering
exempting more multi-party sites from cleanup liability, the
Transportation source said. Cleanup would be financed directly
from the Superfund trust fund. The source contended adding new
exemptions for multi-party sites to the current plan would reduce
litigation costs and increase money going to cleanup by one-third
to one-half over the amount spent under current law. The bill
already would exempt municipal landfills and private oil
recycling facilities.

Sources: Osprey Exhibits Problems During Shock Tests

      The Navy's troubled efforts to improve its historically
weak ability to counter anti-ship mines suffered another setback
recently, when the first of a new type of mine-hunting ships came
unglued during simulated combat tests. During explosive shock
trials in late October, some of the interior bulkheads and
equipment platforms and decking of the coastal mine hunter Osprey
became separated from the ship's hull, according to sources
familiar with the tests. The problem appears to be a failure of
the bonding that is supposed to hold together the interior
structures and the hull, all of which are made of a special
plastic material, the sources said. One source said the problems
revealed in the Osprey could require extensive modifications that
also would have to be retrofitted, at additional cost, to the 11
other ships in the class, all of which are completed or nearly
finished.

      The damage to the Osprey is just the latest problem with a
project that ran years behind schedule and well above expected
cost. And it continues a rash of difficulties plaguing the Navy's
entire program to eliminate a war-fighting weakness that
handicapped operations in the Persian Gulf. Capt. Gordon
Peterson, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that the Osprey experienced
some damage during the trials but declined to specify how
extensive it was, citing security concerns. Peterson noted some
damage is expected during shock trials and said that "the ship
maintained the ability to maneuver, navigate and perform its war
fighting missions" at the completion of the tests. But one source
said he was told "they suffered significantly more damage than
they expected."

      Another source said the test was stopped after five
explosions, instead of the planned six shots, and repairs had to
be made between the fourth and fifth explosions. Peterson
confirmed repairs were made and the test cut short, explaining
that Navy experts decided "sufficient data was obtained" in five
shots. A government source said the Navy now is struggling over
how to correct the problems revealed in the shock trials.

House, Senate Schedule For This Week

      Both the House and Senate will adjourn momentarily at noon
Wednesday to fulfill the constitutional requirement of ending the
first session of the 104th Congress Jan. 3. When the House
returns Wednesday, it is expected to take up an override of
President Clinton's veto of the defense authorization bill.
Depending on budget negotiations, the House also may try to
override vetoes of the Interior, Commerce-Justice-State and VA-
HUD appropriations bills later this week. A bill to permit states
to operate national parks at their own expense during the
shutdown also may be brought to the floor. The Senate schedule
also will continue to reflect the negotiations.

Talks On Banking Issues Pushed Back; State Fees Still Problematic

      Budget talks on banking issues have been pushed back and
not yet rescheduled, and the issue of state bank fees is still on
the table, sources said today. At a meeting last week of House
Banking and Budget committee staff, Banking aides did not oppose
a revenue-raising provision that would require federal regulators
to collect fees for their examinations of state-chartered banks,
sources said. Staff took a more "objective" stance, saying the
committee "has never approved of a position" to collect the fees,
according to a source. In contrast, on the issue of whether to
raise the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration loans, "staff
does not recommend this as an option," one source said. State
banks already pay examination fees to state regulators, and
Banking Chairman Leach wrote to the Budget Committee last month
urging budget negotiators not to accept the fee provision,
included in the administration's budget proposal.

Union Asks Congress To Contribute Pay To Furloughed Workers

      The National Treasury Employees Union is asking members of
Congress to donate pay they receive during the partial government
shutdown to furloughed federal workers through the Federal
Employee Education and Assistance Fund. In a letter to Congress
Friday, the NTEU called it an "outrage" that Congress, "who
caused this shutdown crisis by not passing the necessary
appropriations bills on time, have been on vacation for the
holiday and will receive no reduction in pay due to the
furlough." The union also said it will file a temporary
restraining order with a federal court asking that the law
requiring federal employees to work without pay be declared
unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C., offered
Saturday to make available about $10,000 a month from his own pay
for emergency, no-interest loans to furloughed federal workers,
the Associated Press reported. "I know I can't help everyone, but
at least I can get some people through the crisis times," Taylor
said.

Gingrich Admits Mistakes In First Year As Speaker

      Looking back at his first year as speaker of the House and
leader of the Republican revolution, House Speaker Gingrich
acknowledged Saturday that he has made some mistakes and will try
to correct them by confining himself to doing only his job. The
jump from back bench bomb-thrower to key policy decision-maker
caused some errors of inexperience, Gingrich said. "Nobody could
go from being minority whip of the House to the speaker of the
House in one jump and go from being in the opposition party to
working with [Senate Majority Leader] Dole and being really the
dominant agenda-setting force in the country [...] and not make
mistakes," Gingrich said on CNN's "Evans and Novak."

      Among the errors Gingrich noted was linking his treatment
on Air Force One to taking a hard line with President Clinton on
shutting down the government. "There's no question that there are
times, as I've described it, where it's like throwing an
interception straight into the other team's defense. And on
several occasions, and that's one, I did things that weren't
right," Gingrich said. The controversy surrounding his original
acceptance of a $4.5 million book advance also could have been
avoided, he added, by taking advice from people "who understood
being a national figure in the way I frankly didn't understand."

      Gingrich said a major way of avoiding self-inflicted wounds
this year will be to keep to his job as speaker and stop
freelancing as social commentator. Several times in the last year
and a half Gingrich has linked breaking news stories -- like
Susan Smith's murder of her two children in South Carolina -- to
a breakdown of civilization caused by liberal policies. "You
know, I'm speaker of the House. I'm not an assistant professor of
history. I'm not an analyst. I'm not a commentator. And I think
at times I've tried to play other roles, and it's almost always
been wrong," Gingrich said. "I've got to be the speaker of the
House and leader of the House Republican Party and stay inside
that particular box to be effective." Gingrich, however, has said
debate and teaching are the only ways to achieve the broad
cultural goals of conservatives.

      Gingrich also attributed his low poll ratings to how he is
covered by the media. "If I were the person who was seeing seven-
second sound bites, I wouldn't like me either," he said. But he
added that over time, "as people see more of what we're really
doing [...] my ratings will go up." Gingrich also made something
of a New Year's resolution to engage more with individual
reporters and editors in an effort to improve the Republican
revolution. "I'm going to work harder at interacting with
individual editors and reporters to see if we can't get our story
through if by no other means than just embarrassing them into
being professional," he said.

Washington Pundits

   Some observations by Washington experts and pundits on the
ongoing budget battle, as quoted late last week by Reuters:
    "Everyone thought Congress wouldn't leave town for Christmas
with the government shut down because it would look terrible. We
were wrong."

       -- Stanley Collender, a former Hill aide who is now the
in-house budget expert at Price Waterhouse.

       "You have a conflict of issues more fundamental than most
people think. This isn't just children squabbling. This is a real
difference between the way the Republicans in Congress and
Clinton want to take the country."

       -- Stephen Moore, budget analyst at the Cato Institute,
who said the standoff "will probably be ended in the next few
weeks [...] but it could last several months."

       "Custer presumably thought he would win at Little Big
Horn, too."

       -- Political analyst Kevin Phillips -- suggesting that the
Republicans had trapped themselves rhetorically, but are yet to
realize it.
