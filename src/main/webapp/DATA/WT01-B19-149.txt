IV.  THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION 

     The establishment clause prohibits both the state and federal 

government from passing laws which prefer one religion over another. 

[footnote 141]  Whether one adheres to the &quot;broad&quot; interpretation of the 

establishment clause or the &quot;narrower&quot; interpretation, all scholars agree 

that the establishment clause was meant by the framers to prevent the 

government from bestowing a preference on one religion; [footnote 142] 

and, as such, to protect the &quot;small, new, or unpopular denominations&quot; 

[footnote 143] from &quot;subtle departures from neutrality, 'religious 

gerrymanders,' as well as

&quot;denominational preference&quot; is conferred by governmental action.  Amicus 
Certiorari Petition, Dec. 13, 1989, at 9-14 (citing Larson v. Valente, 
456 U.S. 228 (1982)).  Moreover, Amicus argued that confusion surrounding 
the definition of &quot;denominational preference&quot; was arising, and courts 
needed guidance on when strict scrutiny should be applied.  Id. at 15-22. 
     In response, the government asserted that no free exercise, 
establishment, or equal protection rights had been violated because 
&quot;DEA's exemption for religious peyote use in 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1307.31 applies 
equally to all bona fide religious groups.&quot;  Respondent's Opposition To 
Petition For Writ Of Certiorari, Feb. 1990, at 9.  As a result, no 
denominational preference was created and the Lemon test as opposed to 
strict scrutiny was applicable.  Id. at 10.  Moreover, the government 
argued that the DEA's &quot;considered professional judgment&quot; concerning the 
burden of monitoring the exemption should not be questioned.  Id. at 12.

obvious abuses. [footnote 144]  The EZCC is small, new to this country, 

and unpopular. [footnote 145]  As a result, the EZCC has been denied even 

the narrowest exemption for its sacrament while the NAC enjoys an 

unlimited exemption for peyote. 

     A.  Comparing The Two Exemptions 

     The majority stated that Olsen had proposed an exemption identical 

to the one accorded to the NAC. [footnote 146]  This is not true. 

Olsen's proposed exemption is very narrow, restricting the sacramental 

use of marijuana to three hours, one day per week. [footnote 147]  The 

exemption states that once the three hour worship service has finished, 

members may not leave the place where the ceremony was conducted for 

eight additional hours.  The exemption specifically prohibits members 

from driving or going out in public during that post-worship period. 

Only EZCC members who are of the age of majority may participate in the 

service and &quot;membership&quot; is

(citations omitted). 

     [footnote 145]  The total denial of an exemption to the EZCC has had 
tragic results for the members.  The EZCC has publicly stated: 
     Through ... the police force, the church has been 
     severely harassed, victimized and discriminated 
     against.  Our members have passed through several acts 
     of police brutality, our legal properties maliciously 
     destroyed, members falsely imprisoned, divine services 
     broken up, and all these atrocities performed upon the 
     Church, under the name of political laws and their 
     justice. 
1 The Coptic World, Dec. 19, 1987, at 8.  As the Court in Larson 
explained, the free exercise clause and the establishment clause work in 
close conjunction, the guarantees of one reinforcing the guarantees of 
the other.  Larson, 456 U.S. at 244-45.

strictly construed. [footnote 148] 

     While the majority described the NAC exemption as &quot;tightly-cabined,&quot; 

[footnote 149] nothing could be further from the truth.  The NAC 

exemption is unlimited; it states that &quot;Schedule I does not apply to the 

nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native 

American Church.&quot; [footnote 150]  The only benefit strictly limited to 

&quot;members&quot; is a waiver of the registration requirement if the member 

manufactures or distributes peyote to the NAC. [footnote 151]  Other than 

that, the exemption does not limit participation in the peyote ceremony 

to church members or people of majority, nor does it restrict driving or 

even suggest a detoxification period.  Given the lack of any consensus on 

the meaning of &quot;Native American Church,&quot; either among Native Americans or 

by those outside of the Church, and the widely diverging views on how the 

religious ceremony is to be conducted, [footnote 152] the peyote 

exemption is very broad, indeed. 

     The majority was quite concerned with how rigidly membership was 

enforced in the EZCC and whether membership was required before one was 

allowed to participate in the sacrament. [footnote 153]  But the majority 

failed to note that the NAC exemption is not limited

there any consensus within the NAC as to what even constitutes a member. 

[footnote 154] 

     B.  Comparing the Law Enforcement Problems 

     The majority stated that it based its &quot;decision on the immensity of 

the marijuana control problem.&quot; [footnote 155]  But under a strict 

scrutiny analysis, this statement becomes less persuasive. [footnote 156] 

Thirty-three states have enacted some type of legislation which 

recognizes that marijuana has valid medicinal uses. [footnote 157]  These 

states have not found that an immense &quot;marijuana control problem&quot; 

presents any barrier to creating limited marijuana exemptions.  In light 

of the fact that the federal

government dispenses marijuana for medical uses, [footnote 158] and that 

five people in America have federal permission to use marijuana to help 

with chronic ailments, [footnote 159] the arguments that marijuana poses 

serious health risks and has no acceptable safety use are highly suspect. 

[footnote 160]  Moreover, the majority accepted without question the DEA 

data about abuse, availability, and demand instead of examining marijuana 

in terms of current trends. 

     The DEA set forth statistics regarding the amounts of marijuana 

seized between 1980-1987. [footnote 161]  Yet a breakdown of these 

statistics year by year establishes that the use of marijuana has been 

steadily decreasing since 1979.  Many people assert that both production 

and consumption of marijuana in the country is on the decrease, [footnote 

163] and that any threat posed by marijuana is

waning. [footnote 164]  Indeed, when casual possession of marijuana was 

decriminalized in California in 1976 (those caught with an ounce or less 

paid fines similar to that of a traffic ticket), marijuana &quot;fell out of 

fashion....  Polls taken over the last 10 years show marijuana use down 

as much as 50 percent.&quot; [footnote 165]  The fact that Alaska, the only 

state where marijuana possession was legal, recently voted to re-

criminalize it and other similar trends, [footnote 166]  calls into 

question the continued vitality of marijuana's allure.  Whether marijuana

about marijuana make &quot;the job of law enforcement so much easier,&quot;

monitoring burden the DEA states would accompany the EZCC exemption.  In 

addition, it simply defies logic that a church with a membership of 

250,000 to 300,000 people would be easier to monitor than a church with a 

membership of one-hundred to two-hundred people.  Olsen agreed to provide 

a list of member names and places of worship.  Under the NAC exemption, 

however, the DEA has no idea where or when ceremonies will take place or 

who will be participating.  This would appear to make monitoring 

exponentially more difficult.  Nonetheless, monitoring the NAC exemption, 

apparently, has not imposed a burden on the DEA.  Nor does it seem likely 

that monitoring the limited EZCC exemption would be significant. 

     C.  Comparing the Churches' Rituals 

     The NAC ritual which involves an all night service perhaps once a 

week, [footnote 168] is more acceptable in the court's view than the EZCC 

ritual which traditionally is a daily observance.  The majority's concern 

about the EZCC's regular use of its sacrament seems to state a clear 

preference for religions that engage sparingly in the use of their 

sacrament. [footnote 169]  The Catholic Church offers the holy sacrament 

for ingestion at every worship service (mass), and members are free to 

engage in worship on a daily

basis, if not more. [footnote 170]  On the other hand, many Protestant 

denominations offer the holy sacrament once a month, or less. [footnote 

171]  Speaking in terms of one's religious tradition, how often one 

partakes of holy communion should not be a basis upon which one church 

receives an exemption and another church does not.  The EZCC ritual is 

more akin to the lifestyle of a religious order living in community where 

communion might be celebrated at various times throughout the day.  The 

majority found it significant that EZCC members were allowed to ingest 

their sacrament outside of the confines of the church facility.

[footnote 172]  This concern again seems to be placing an unfair premium 

on certain types of rituals.  The Protestant and Catholic Churches of 

America celebrate and distribute their sacrament in shopping malls, 

[footnote 173] parking lots, [footnote 174] buses, [footnote 175] 

hospitals, [footnote 176] parks, [footnote 177] homes; [footnote 178] in

the sacrament cannot be celebrated.  Furthermore, finding it significant 

that ingestion of the sacrament be limited to the confines of a &quot;church 

facility&quot; appears suspect when it is not at all clear that the NAC even 

has the functional equivalent of a &quot;church facility.&quot; [footnote 179] 

     The majority dispensed with Olsen's proposed exemption by stating 

that &quot;'narrow' use, concededly, is not his religion's tradition.&quot; 

[footnote 180]  The court cannot in good faith use the tradition of the 

EZCC as a basis for suggesting that the exemption will not be adhered to. 

Whether an exemption tracks a religious tradition or not is irrelevant, 

has never been the law, and should not be used to circumvent a religious 

group's proposal to compromise.  Accepting the EZCC's offer to modify its 

traditions rather than resorting to total ban on the religion's sacrament 

would seem to serve the government's best interest.  Given the choice 

between an unlimited drug exemption for a church which is loosely knit 

together with few checks on behavior [footnote 181] and a narrowly drawn 

exemption which incorporates many checks on behavior for a church that 

nonetheless has not traditionally restricted its sacrament, the latter 

seems preferable.

     The majority noted &quot;further distinctions&quot; between the rituals of the 

two religions: 

     1) the peyote exemption was accorded for a traditional, 
     precisely circumscribed ritual; 

     2) peyote is an object of worship; 

     3) for the NAC, use of peyote outside of the ritual is 
     sacrilegious; and 

     4) the NAC, for all practical purposes, &quot;reinforces&quot; 
     the state's prohibition. [footnote 182] 

First, marijuana is a traditional ritual for the EZCC. [footnote 183] 

Moreover, the NAC's &quot;precisely circumscribed ritual&quot; lasts at least 

twelve hours, while the EZCC proposal would limit the service to three 

hours. [footnote 184]  The peyote ceremony has myriad manifestations, and 

there is no prohibition on how often one might participate in a NAC 

ceremony--while Olsen has limited participation in the EZCC sacrament to 

one night per week, and it is always the same night. [footnote 185] 

Second, the DEA has conceded in its briefs that marijuana for the EZCC is 

an object of worship. [footnote 186]  Third, for the EZCC, use of 

marijuana outside of the ritual is sacrilegious: &quot;The

Church believes that [recreational use] of marijuana, by members or 

nonmembers, constitutes sacrilegious behavior.&quot; [footnote 187]  Even 

during the ceremony, those ingesting marijuana do not inhale the smoke 

into their lungs; they avoid its intoxicating effects by taking it into 

their mouths and exhaling it from their noses.&quot; [footnote 188]  Finally, 

the EZCC religion, for all practical purposes, reinforces the state's 

prohibitions.  The members of the EZCC do not approve of drug abuse in 

any form, and alcohol is strictly forbidden.&quot; [footnote 189]  Indeed, all 

aspects of conduct are strictly regulated by a literal interpretation of 

the Old Testament. [footnote 190]  Thus, the differences noted by the 

majority are instead distinct similarities between the two churches. 

     D.  Comparison of the Drugs 

     Both peyote and marijuana are Schedule I drugs which means that they 

both: 1) have a high potential for abuse; 2) have no currently accepted 

medical use in treatment; and 3) lack of accepted safety for use under 

medical supervision. [footnote 191]  The only argument that can be made 

that these drugs are not similarly situated in terms of the government's 

definition regarding dangerous drugs, is that marijuana does not even 

meet the second

Young, found that &quot;[m]arijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest 
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot;  In re Marijuana 
Rescheduling Petition, No. 86-22 at 58-59 (Sept. 6, 1988) (&quot;In strict 
medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly 
consume.&quot;).  The Judge stated further that &quot;[a] smoker would 
theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within 
about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.&quot;  Id. at 57-58.  Based 
on his findings, after two years of testimony, Judge Young recommended 
that marijuana be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.  Id. at 67-
68.  It is interesting to note that Olsen was a party to this suit.  Id. 
at 4, 6.

Native American culture, including the native religion, is federal 

policy. [footnote 198]  That the American people show a sympathy and 

romantic affinity for the Native Americans is clear and is explicitly 

understood to be part of Congress' agenda: 

     [T]he country is now sympathetic to the cultural needs 
     of Indians.  The American Indian Religious Freedom Act 
     of 1978 ... is evidence of this concern.  If we took 
     steps to revoke the [NAC] Exemption, Congress, the 
     Indians and the public would be &quot;on our backs.&quot; 
     [footnote 199] 

It is not inappropriate to suggest that a church originating in Africa, 

coming to America via Jamaica would meet with much less sympathy. 

Indeed, the EZCC denial may stem from racial animus where the general 

perception equates blacks with drugs and crime. [footnote 200]  Moreover, 

the specter of xenophobia cannot be dismissed.  If Native Americans have 

a much higher level of political and popular support, this is exactly the 

type of case that should trigger the protections of the establishment

V.   CONCLUSION 

     Congress and the DEA have accorded a sacramental drug exemption to 

Native Americans regarding peyote. [footnote 202]  The EZCC has tried for 

years to obtain a similar exemption regarding marijuana. [footnote 203] 

This past June, the Supreme Court denied certiorari to the District of 

Columbia Court of Appeals decision denying the EZCC a sacramental drug 

exemption similar to that held by the NAC. [footnote 204] 

     The court of appeals decision to deny an exemption to the EZCC 

violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. [footnote 

205]  The court's reliance on the DEA's statement that it has greater law 

enforcement control problems with marijuana will not satisfy an 

application of strict scrutiny.  The DEA must explain why a very narrow 

exemption extended to one-hundred to two-hundred people would undermine 

its interest in preventing drug abuse when an unlimited exemption for 

peyote extended to 300,000 to 400,000 people does not. [footnote 206] 

Additionally, there must be a forthright analysis of the current trends 

regarding the public's abuse of marijuana and the growing body of

information concerning marijuana's use for medicinal purposes. [footnote 

207] 

     The court set forth various aspects of the NAC which made it 

particularly well suited for an exemption, and then failed to recognize 

that the EZCC has demonstrated significant similarity to the NAC 

regarding these aspects. [footnote 208]  For example, the EZCC views the 

recreational use of its sacrament as sacrilegious, has much stricter 

controls on its membership, and regards marijuana as a deity as does the 

NAC concerning peyote. [footnote 209]  Additionally, as a result of its 

proposed exemption, the EZCC would exercise much greater control over its 

ceremony than the NAC. [footnote 210] 

     The EZCC is being denied a benefit accorded to another church 

because of its ritual, its traditions, because it is not indigenous, and 

because of the abuse of its sacrament by others.  The EZCC has proposed 

to modify its tradition and ritual, to adhere to practices which are much 

more restrictive than those of the NAC, and to help with monitoring 

problems, to no avail. [footnote 211]  The reasons for the denial appear 

to flow from the fact that the EZCC is a relatively new religion to this 

country, of black origins, small, and unpopular. [footnote 212]  The 

establishment clause was specifically written to protect these very types 

of religions
