<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>THE FLAWED FINNISH FOLLY</CENTER></H3>

<HR>
<P>
        It was the lead article in the April 14, 1994 issue of our prestigious medical magazine,
the
<I>
New England Journal of Medicine.  
</I>
        If your physician missed that particular issue, not to worry; the information became
front-page news and the message blared forth from every radio and TV news broadcast. Not
just the medical community, but every American was privy to the premature conclusions of
this amazing study, rushed out for political convenience: The researchers found no reduction
in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary
supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the
possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects.

<P>
Within hours, 
<I>
Citizens for Health 
</I>
countered via fax and phone with the following information:

<UL>
        <LI>The media has given enormous coverage to a single badly flawed Finnish study which
        supposedly showed negative results. The Finnish study appeared in a publication that is
                heavily dependent on pharmaceutical advertising support and shows a bias against vitamin
                supplementation.
        <LI>The researchers used only 1/8th to 1/40th the dosage of vitamin E shown by more than 20
                previous studies to lower risk of lung cancer.
        <LI>Researchers used only 1/10th the dosage of beta carotene recommended for the prevention
                of lung cancer in smokers. The more potent vitamin C was curiously absent from the study.
        <LI>Researchers used as subjects the people from Finland, despite the fact that Finland is
                one of the worst countries in the world for cancer/nutrition studies for several reasons. Among them:
</UL>

Finns have one of the world's highest rates of per capita alcohol consumption by
smokers, and alcohol interferes with the utilization of vitamin E and beta carotene.
<P>
        Finland has an extremely low level of the essential mineral selenium in the soil. 
Selenium acts in connection with vitamin E in promoting cancer prevention. This
highly-questionable study was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), using tax
dollars provided by the American public.  The NCI must answer to Congress and the American
people: Why was such an inappropriate study supported?

<BR>
WAS RUSHED OUT FOR POLITICAL
<BR>
CONVENIENCE.</CENTER></H3>
<HR>
<P>
The National Health Federation added additional information:

<UL>
        <LI>Even the authors of the study admit that the report may be subject to chance and error.
        <LI>The dietary intake of the water-soluble nutrients vitamin C, folic acid, and
        B vitamins is extremely low in Finland. The molecular mechanisms by which beta
        carotene and vitamin E protect against lung cancer in smokers depends on
        adequate levels of water-soluble nutrients.
        
        <LI>Men who had adequate levels of beta carotene or vitamin E were intentionally
        excluded from the Finnish study, which meant that only men with very high risk
        factors for developing lung cancer (that is, poor diets and heavy smoking) were
        allowed to participate. This distorted the real value of proper nutrition for
        cancer prevention.
        <LI>A study published in the British Journal of Cancer (1992, 66:1164) showed
        that beta carotene reduced pre-cancerous DNA damage to smoker's lungs by 47
        percent within a relatively short period of time.

        <BR><B>Editor's Note:</B> It has also been suggested that a carcinogenic dye had been
used in the coating of the beta carotene used in the study.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>MORE OLDER PEOPLE SURVIVING
HEART ATTACKS</CENTER></H3>
<HR>

<P>A report in a journal revered by conventional practitioners informs that
mortality rates at 30 days and at one year after a heart attack fell 10 percent
between 19 87 and 1990. The reasons given?  Quicker arrival at the hospital,
clot-dissolving drugs, and greater use of angioplasty and bypass surgery!

<I>Source:</I> Johns Hopkins Medical Letter, <I>Health After 50,</I> June 1994.

        <BR><B>Editor's note:</B>  Although accurate in part, the information errs by omission.
 No credit was given to increased interest in exercise and other lifestyle
changes.  One way to counteract misleading conclusions is to send your physician
a gift of the Alternative Medicine Digest.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>SHOP AROUND FOR BEST DRUG PRICES</CENTER></H3>

        If you take the time to shop around, you'll find that price differences in
drugs are almost unbelievable.  A little investigative Journalism showed that
the same quantity varied from a low $62.58 to a high of $122.40. Some prices
quoted with "discounts" were higher than undiscounted prices from those who
offered no discounts.

THE POLITICAL ARENA</CENTER></H3>

<CENTER>VITAMIN COMPANY FOUND NOT GUILTY </CENTER>

<P>Not unlike the attack on Dr. Jonathan Wright's Clinic, the FDA raided the
offices of Tierra Marketing in Albuquerque. On June 17th, however, the Federal
District Court cleared Tierra Marketing of I of 15 counts, the jury failing to
reach agreement on four counts. The judge stated that the case was "...an issue
of government overreaching"

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>OKLAHOMA PASSES ALTERNATIVE
HEALTH CARE BIL</CENTER></H3>L

        We sincerely hope that Oklahoma is setting an example for the rest of the
country. It is now legal to practice healing arts based on religious,
philosophical, and cultural beliefs in that state. This Alternative Health Care
Services and Products Bill protects Americans' freedom of choice. The original
bill would have granted the medical board the right to request any patient's
file and the right to charge anyone who administered a "drug"(generic
definition) with a felony Grass roots organizations helped to change that bill.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>HOW TO INFLUENCE
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM</CENTER></H3>

        <I>Citizens for Health,</I> the excellent newsletter that keeps America informed
about essential political health issues, implores everyone to get involved with
any of the over 150 local and state chapters in this country that are working
together to educate the public and influence state legislatures and Congress. 
Alexander Schauss, executive director of Citizens for Health, states, "The power
of citizens working together to improve the health care system and reform the
sickcare industry of this country is immense."

        <P>We encourage you to be part of that power. You can start by joining <I>Citizens
for Health.</I> Tacoma, WA. 1-800-357-221 1.
