<B>Alcoholism</B> is a disease that affects not only the addicted person, but his/her family as well.  Many children grow up in homes where one or both parents are alcoholics or abuse alcohol.  Sometimes children of alcoholics are also physically, sexually, and emotionally abused.  But even if no overt abuse takes place, the child growing up in an alcoholic family suffers damage.  
<br>
<B>Adult Children of Alcoholics</B> often experience some of the following:
<ul>
<li> they also abuse alcohol or have problems with alcohol use
<li> problems with interpersonal relationships
<li> trouble with anger management
<li> low self-esteem
<li> inability to trust
<li> feelings of guilt
<li> depression
</ul>
<P>
<H3>Facts and Figures for Children of Alcoholics:</H3>
<ul>
<li>Alcoholics are more likely than nonalcoholics to have an alcoholic father, mother, sibling, or other relative.  In addition, <U>children of alcoholics (COAs) are more likely than non-COAs to marry into families in which alcoholism is prevalent.</U>
<li>Roughly 1 in 8 American adults is alcoholic or experiences problems due to the use of alcohol.
<li>It is estimated that there are 28.6 million COAs in the U.S.; 6.6 million are under the age of 18.
<li>COAs are 2 to 4 times more likely than non-COAs to develop alcoholism.
<li> Physiological and environmental factors appear to place COAs at greater risk of becoming alcoholic.
<li>COAs are at increased risk for other drug use, <U>especially as they approach late adolescence.</U>
<li>COAs often believe that they will be failures even if they do well academically.  They do not see themselves as successful.
