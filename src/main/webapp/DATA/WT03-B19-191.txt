<h1>Standard of Living and Price Competitiveness</h1>
<p>
While Victoria is a very cost-competitive location for international 
business, it also enjoys a high standard of living. The Big Mac Index 
published in The Economist is a measure of relative purchasing 
power 
in each of the countries surveyed, based on the price of a Big Mac 
relative 
to average per capita income in these countries. The index reveals 
that 
on this measure Australia, shown as base 100 in table 40, has the 
fourth highest per capita income amongst the twenty-one countries 
which 
were surveyed.
