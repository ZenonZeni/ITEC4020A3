Differences Among Similar Sector Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

Sector mutual funds--those that concentrate in an industry or a few related industries--not surprisingly tend to mirror the performance of their sector. Industries covered range from defense and aerospace to leisure, with sectors focusing on regional banks and air transportation in between.<p>


But investing in these funds is not as easy as simply picking the right sector.<p>


Risk is an important consideration. Sector funds tend to concentrate their investments on fewer stocks within their industry than an average common stock mutual fund. The result? Sector funds can be extremely volatile, and while individual firm risk is reduced through diversification, industry risk is magnified.<p>


Beyond the challenge of deciding which sector to go into is deciding on which fund among all those that, at least by name, are in the same sector. The challenge is that not all funds in the same sector are similar.<p>


For one, portfolio managers sometimes have very different viewpoints of what constitutes a sector. For example, health-related sector funds may or may not include pharmaceutical companies, medical technology, or even biotechnology.<p>


In addition, many sector funds operating in what on the surface may appear to be a less diverse sector, such as utilities, still have a wide latitude of action in portfolio composition and structure. Stock/cash allocations, sector segment weights, top stock holdings, and number of securities are just as likely not to match as match within the same sector fund designation. <p>


Sector funds often populate both the tops and bottoms of performance lists. So how should you play them: Go with what is hot, be a contrarian and buy the bottom, or throw up your hands and buy them all?<p>


None of those strategies is likely to be consistently effective over the long term. One strategy that may prove useful is to shade your portfolio toward a sector that you have some knowledge of (through your work experience or education, for example) and that you feel has positive long-term prospects but that you do not feel qualified or have time to follow and pick enough individual stocks to diversify within the industry.<p>


Despite their differences, there are certain points to keep in mind when considering any investment in any sector fund:<p>

<ul>
<li> Sector funds can be very volatile.<p>


<li> While sector funds are usually diversified by company, reducing company risk, they are not diversified by industry, which adds to risk.<p>


 <li>Funds that are in the same sector, and even those with essentially the same name, can have portfolios that are vastly different and management strategies that are polar.<p>


<li> Funds within the same sector can produce dramatically different yield and total return numbers.<p>
</ul>

Before investing in a sector fund, get the prospectus and annual report of at least a few funds with five-year records in the same sector; be sure to compare industry weightings, top holdings, expense ratios, yield and total return for one, three, and five years.<p>


And remember, picking the fund is going to be a lot easier than picking the sector.<p>
