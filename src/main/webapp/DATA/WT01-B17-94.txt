<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Normally, as you age your body runs low on a crucial brain-secreted hormone, 
but now injections of Human Growth Hormone can turn the aging process around 
and put youth back into your life.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>By Elmer M. Cranton, M.D. and James P. Frackelton, M.D.  &copy;1995</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P>
Are aging and physical decline inevitable? No, says alternative medicine, and here
are two examples to prove it.

<P>H.T., a 64-year-old businessman, has been giving himself daily injections of Human
Growth Hormone for the past 4 years.  Here are the results in his own words: &quot;My
energy, stamina and sex drive are like those of a 30 year-old. Muscle tone is
fantastically improved. My waist went from 42 inches to 34 and my body fat went from
29 to 12% of body weight. The palsy in my hand is gone, I discarded my bifocal
glasses, and my skin has changed from tissue-thin to youthful. I look in the mirror
in the morning and can't believe this guy is me. It looks like me when I was 30.&quot;

<P>J.H., a 40-year-old businesswoman, suffered for many years with chronic fatigue and
constant pain in her jaw and head from degeneration in the temporal mandibular joints
(TMJ syndrome). After taking daily growth hormone injections, she states: &quot;I was a
40-year-old woman with a 60-year-old body. On growth-hormone therapy, my TMJ pain is
gone completely; my energy and stamina are increased, fat is decreased, and I feel
much more alive, blossoming inside, almost euphoric.&quot;

<P>This is an indication of what human growth hormone replacement therapy can do to
reverse or slow the age-related symptoms of physical and mental decline.

<P>To appreciate the merits of human growth hormone, first it's necessary to understand
hormones and their role in health. Hormones are tiny chemical messengers continuously
secreted into the blood stream by the endocrine glands (pituitary, pineal, thyroid,
thymus, adrenal) to regulate the activities of vital organs. Hormones stimulate a
multitude of life-giving processes throughout the body, which, in turn, maintain
health, harmony, growth, healing and repair. Probably the best known hormone is
insulin, produced in the pancreas.  When insulin production declines or ceases,
diabetes results.
<A NAME="HGH"> </A>
<P>Growth hormone, naturally secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain, is a small
protein-like hormone similar to insulin. Commonly referred to as Human Growth
Hormone, or HGH, it is secreted in very brief pulses during the early hours of sleep
and remains in circulation for only a few minutes.  It is quickly taken into 
the liver and converted into  somatomedin-C, another small hormone (also known as
insulin-like growth factor-one, or IGF-I). Somatomedin-C is responsible for most of
the activity of growth hormone in the body.  

<P>During adolescence, when growth is most rapid, production of HGH is  high. That is
why it was named &quot;growth hormone&quot;-it seems to contain the secret of growth itself. 
Even after growth stops, growth hormone must continue to be present (at somewhat
lower levels) throughout life to maintain physical and mental health and well-being. 

<P>Tissue repair, healing, cell replacement, organ integrity, bone strength, brain
function, enzyme production, and the integrity of hair, nails, and skin also require
the ongoing availability of adequate growth hormone.  Learning, memory and
intelligence all depend on adequate growth hormone.  As growth hormone levels decline
with age, the functions of all vital organs decrease.

<P>After age 20, growth hormone production declines progressively, at an average rate of
about 14% per decade.  By age 60, it is not uncommon to measure a growth hormone loss
of 75% or more.  Physical decline with age correlates directly with decreased
secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. This also suggests that if you
can prevent your body's supply of HGH from dropping to as low as 75% of its original
supply, you can conceivably start to reverse the aging process itself. 

<P>Like insulin, growth hormone is given by injection. A small syringe with a tiny
needle is used to give self-administered injections just under the skin, usually 4
days each week. Benefits occur slowly during the first few months of therapy. 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>IMPORTANT!</FONT> As tissue repair, healing, and cell replacement are speeded up by growth hormone
replacement, the need for nutrients of all types increases. This means if your body
is deficient or borderline in essential nutrients, an increase in cell growth,
produced by HGH, can at the same time aggravate or create deficiencies. 

<P>For that reason, it is wise to seek out a physician skilled in clinical nutrition and
preventive medicine when you start growth hormone therapy. You will need to assess
and replace other deficient hormones (such as thyroid and DHEA) and free-radical
antioxidants for optimum results. 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTION!</FONT>  At recommended dosages, HGH appears to be safe. Side effects reported in medical
research, such as overgrowth of body parts (called acromegaly) are mostly associated
with very large doses. Doses of growth hormone given as part of research are as much
as eight times the amount normally produced by the pituitary gland. Such deliberate
overdosage has caused carpal tunnel syndrome, decreased glucose tolerance (increased
tendency to diabetes), breast enlargement (even in males), and fluid retention.
 
 <P>However, we can confidently state that low-dose growth hormone therapy (4 to 8 units
per week) is now known to be clinically effective and free of significant side
effects.  Side effects that do occur, such as mild fluid retention, usually pass
within a few weeks as the body readjusts to a more youthful metabolic rate.

<P>The present treatment cost of approximately $13,000 per year per patient remains
expensive for many, and most medical insurance will reimburse only for HGH treatment
of dwarfism in children. It is helpful that the costs of HGH therapy (FDA approved
for treating under-active pituitary glands) are tax deductible. We hope the cost will
come down in the future as generic versions of HGH become available and as usage
increases.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Benefits of Growth Hormone Therapy</CENTER></H3>

Benefits from growth hormone replacement as reported in the scientific literature
include increased muscle mass, improved physical strength, reduced fatigue, decreased
fat (especially abdominal fat), increased bone strength, and revitalization of liver,
kidney, spleen, and brain functions. Skin regains a more youthful appearance with
fewer wrinkles and sexual function improves.  Cholesterol decreases and cartilage in
joints becomes stronger.  Osteoporosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease are
improved. 

<P>HGH replacement also leads to increased exercise capacity, strong kidney blood flow
and efficiency, improved cardiac function and reduced risk from cardiovascular
problems, and a general enhancement in one's sense of well-being. A markedly better
quality of life has also resulted for AIDs patients receiving growth hormone.
Another important benefit from growth hormone replacement is that it strengthens the
immune system. The incidence of infections decreases, recovery from illness is aided,
allergies improve, and immune-related diseases such as arthritis become less
bothersome.  Although it has been speculated that growth hormone might speed the
spread of cancer, that has not been seen in clinical practice. In fact, improved
immunity might logically be expected to reduce the risk of malignancy and speed
healing of a treated cancer.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>A BRIEF HISTORY OF GROWTH HORMONE</CENTER></H3>


<P>Originally, growth hormone, which consists of 191 amino acids (protein
building blocks), was synthesized in the early 1980s to correct
disturbances in normal growth. Children who develop a pituitary deficiency
of growth hormone at a young age will never grow normally and are destined
to become dwarfs as adults if untreated. Initially, supplies were very
limited, expensive, and sometimes contaminated-nor was there enough growth
hon-none available to treat all the children who needed it. Thanks to the
marketing zeal of drug companies, HGH can be overprescribed for
short-stature children as only 50% of the 15,000 American children
currently receiving HGH for supposedly stunted growth are deficient in
growth hormone.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>IMPORTANT!</FONT> But with the development of recombinant 
DNA technology, human growth
hormone has, since the late 1980s, become more available and in pure form
although it is expensive. Still, the increasing availability of growth
hormone now provides a new dimension in health care.
<P>It was a physician named Daniel Rudman, M.D., of the Medical College of
Wisconsin in Milwaukee, who first asked the crucial question. &quot;Do
hormone levels control the aging process? If they do, then does replacing
them to the youthful range in humans reverve the effects of aging?&quot; To
find out, Dr. Rudman conducted a groundbreaking scientific research project
in 1991 giving growth hormone injections to 21 men, between the ages of 61
and 8 1. Dr. Rudman stated in an interview, &quot;We reversed 10 to 20
years of the aging process ... fat diminished, muscle tissue
increased.&quot;
