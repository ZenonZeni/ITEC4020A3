<h2><strong><u>Who we are</u></strong></h2>
<p>When Roses Only began operating in North America, we were the
only company to fly roses from our own gardens in Ecuador
directly to our shops. More than a million customers later, that
distinction is still ours- and it's a very important one for you.
What you get are the freshest, most beautiful roses you've ever
seen.</p>
<p>Perhaps the big surprise is price. Because we handle every
stage in the process ourselves, we are able to sell you the
highest quality roses at incredibly low prices. That's no
one-time marketing gimmick either, but a genuine commitment that
has guided Roses Only since Day One.</p>
<p>And because we want you to become a regular Roses Only
customer for many years, we take pride in the professional staff
we've developed. We want your experience with us to be pleasant
and completely to your satisfaction. Call any of our <a
href="rosesloc.htm">locations</a> and we will be glad to discuss
how best to meet your regular floral needs. Of course, corporate
accounts are available for your convenience.</p>
<p>We look forward to the beginning of a long-lasting
relationship.</p>
<p>And now, with special pricing available, the cost of making
someone smile with roses is now affordable. You can send 1 dozen
of our best roses to anyone, anywhere in the United States,
delivered overnight for only <strong>$39.99</strong>. Contact our
stores for more details and availability of colors or you can <a
