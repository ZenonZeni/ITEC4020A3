OF POWER AND RIGHT is a &quot;dual biography&quot; of Justices Hugo Black
and William O. Douglas. One might wonder whether such a book is necessary.
After all, we hardly lack material on Black. In addition to Black's own
works, we possess studies by Tinsley Yarbrough (1988), Mark Silverstein
(1984), James Magee (1980), and Gerald Dunne (1977). The literature on Douglas
is no less voluminous. Douglas wrote three autobiographies, and there are,
among others, fine studies by James Simon (1980) and Vern Coun- tryman (1974).
Nor do we lack histories of the Courts on which they served.<BR>
<BR>
So why read OF POWER AND RIGHT? Ball and Cooper tell us how two markedly
different men came to &quot;share a partnership and a contest.&quot; In
recounting the story, they promise us a unique perspective on the Supreme
Court as an institution. OF POWER AND RIGHT also promises us an education
in the fundamental conflict of American constitutional life, the tension
between a democratic conception of political power and the protection of
individual liberty.<BR>
<BR>
In many ways, OF POWER AND RIGHT is a success. Its discus- sion of the relationship
between Black and Douglas is discerning. Ball and Cooper capture the essential
differences between the two men, differences that traced their origins,
as Ball and Cooper so vividly demonstrate, to their personal and professional
lives before they were appointed to the Court. The authors deserve special
praise for their decision to include a chapter on the New Deal backgrounds
of Black and Douglas, in which they detail Hugo- to-Hell Black's stormy
career in the Senate and Douglas's contro- versial years at the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Their political backgrounds, the authors argue,
contributed to Black and Douglas's harsh criticism of the Court before Roosevelt
put their names in nomination.<BR>
<BR>
The book also realizes its attempt to tell us something of the Court as
institution. Drawing extensively on the private papers of several justices,
Ball and Cooper chronicle the inter- nal dynamics of the post-New Deal Court
as it struggled to find its place in America's constitutional revolution.
Ball and Cooper picture a Court sensitive to law, politics, and sometimes
personality. Their treatment of the very public dispute between Justices
Black and Jackson, for example, is measured and fair, as is their discussion
of the antagonism between Justices Douglas and Frankfurter. The book is
especially moving when it chroni- cles Black's departure from the Court
and Douglas's reaction to the loss of his colleague and friend.<BR>

Unfortunately, the book is less successful in its other purpose: to tell
us something about the constitutional tension between democratic power and
individual right. Scattered summa- ries of Black's and Douglas's constitutional
philosophies appear throughout the book; they feature most prominently in
the chap- ters that address specific areas of constitutional law. In general,
however, these treatments are far too brief and mislead- ingly simple. The
problem is partly reflected in Ball and Cooper's decision to associate Black
with power, and Douglas with right. <BR>
<BR>
Unadorned, constitutional positivism is, as Ball and Cooper suggest, a theory
of the constitutional order that emphasizes the power of the people to govern.
Similarly, a commitment to the priority of individual liberty, is, in its
simplest forms, a theory of the constitutional order that emphasizes not
power but right. As held by Black and Douglas, however, these philosophies
are profoundly complex. Theories of constitutional interpreta- tion premised
upon power or right, for example, necessarily imply somewhat different attitudes
toward the proper use of judicial power and somewhat different approaches
to constitutional inter- pretation.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout much of their career together, Black and Douglas could work together
despite differences in their understanding of constitutional government,
for only occasionally did they lead to disparate decisions. In the last
decade of their time together, however, the Court began to address issues,
notably concerning privacy and equality, in which implicit differences became
manifest. Black and Douglas increasingly found themselves on separate sides
in important cases, such as Griswold v. Connecti- cut (1965). <BR>
<BR>
Ball and Cooper tell us about the parting and that it sprang, ultimately,
from differences in constitutional philoso- phy. But because their discussions
of constitutional philosophy largely proceed piecemeal, only readers already
familiar with the intricacies of constitutional interpretation are likely
to appreciate fully how theories of power and right figured both in contests
over constitutional interpretation and over the proper extent of federal
judicial power. The complexities of their constitutional theories, then,
no less than Black and Douglas's political experiences in the Senate and
the SEC, warrant a separate chapter early in the book. <BR>
<BR>
Notwithstanding this omission, OF POWER AND RIGHT is an impressive study
of a friendship that endured three decades and conquered formidable differences
in style, temperament, and, finally, constitutional philosophy. Comprehensive,
engaging, and sometimes moving, this is a book all students of the Court
should read.<BR>
