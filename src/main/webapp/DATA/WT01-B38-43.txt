<h1><font color="#000000"><b>Fiorella LaGuardia on Prohibition</b></font></h1>

<hr>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>Fiorella H. LaGuardia</b> was a
prominent New York city politician who served several terms in
the House of Representatives. An outspoken critic of prohibition,
he testified to the policy's failure. <i>The National Prohibition
Law</i>, Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.
Senate, 69th Congress, 1st Session (1926): 649-52 </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is impossible to tell whether
prohibition is a good thing or a bad thing. It has never been
enforced in this country. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">There may not be as much liquor in
quantity consumed to-day as there was before prohibition, but
there is just as much alcohol. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">At least 1,000,000 quarts of liquor is
consumed each day in the United States. In my opinion such an
enormous traffic in liquor could not be carried on without the
knowledge, if not the connivance of the officials entrusted with
the enforcement of the law. ... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I believe that the percentage of whisky
drinkers in the United States now is greater than in any other
country of the world. Prohibition is responsible for that. ... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">At least $1,000,000,000 a year is lost
to the National Government and the several States and counties in
excise taxes. The liquor traffic is going on just the same. This
amount goes into the pockets of bootleggers and in the pockets of
the public officials in the shape of graft.... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I will concede that the saloon was odius
but now we have delicatessen stores, pool rooms, drug stores,
millinery shops, private parlors, and 57 other varieties of
speak-easies selling liquor and flourishing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I have heard of $2,000 a year
prohibition agents who run their own cars with liveried
chauffeurs. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is common talk in my part of the
country that from $7.50 to $12 a case is paid in graft from the
time the liquor leaves the 12-mile limit until it reaches the
ultimate consumer. There seems to be a varying market price for
this service created by the degree of vigilance or the degree of
greed of the public officials in charge. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is my calculation that at least a
million dollars a day is paid in graft and corruption to Federal,
State, and local officers. Such a condition is not only
intolerable, but it is demoralizing and dangerous to organized
government. ... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The Government even goes to the trouble
to facilitate the financing end of the bootlegging industry. In
1925, $286,950,000 more of $10,000 bills were issued than in 1920
and $25,000,000 more of $5,000 bills were issued. What honest
business man deals in $10,000 bills? Surely these bills were not
used to pay the salaries of ministers. The bootlegging industry
has created a demand for bills of large denominations, and the
Treasury Department accommodates them. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The drys seemingly are afraid of the
truth. Why not take inventory and ascertain the true conditions.
Let us not leave it to the charge of an antiprohibition
organization, or to any other private association, let us have an
official survey and let the American people know what is going
on. A complete and honest and impartial survey would reveal
incredible conditions, corruption, crime, and an organized system
of illicit traffic such as the world has never seen. ... </font></p>
