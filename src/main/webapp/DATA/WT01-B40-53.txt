<h1>EVIDENCE FOUND OF ANCIENT MARIJUANA USE </h1>

<p>Albany (NY) Times Union, 20 May 1993 </p>

<p>(attributed to Newsday) </p>

<hr>

<p>The first physical evidence that marijuana was used as a
medicine in the ancient Mideast was reported Wednesday by Israeli
scientists who found residue of the drug with the skeleton of a
girl who apparently died in childbirth 1,600 years ago. </p>

<p>The researchers said the marijuana probably was used by a
mid-wife trying to speed the birth, as well as ease the pain.
Until now, the researchers wrote in a letter to the journal
Nature, &quot;physical evidence of cannabis (marijuana) use in
the ancient Middle East has not yet been obtained.&quot; </p>

<p>The seven researchers -- from Hebrew University, the Israel
Antiquities Authority and the National Police Headquarters
forensic division -- said references to marijuana as a medicine
are seen as far back as 1,600 B.C. in Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek
and Roman writings. But physical evidence that the hemp weed,
cannabis sativa, was used for that purpose has been missing. </p>

<p>The researchers' examination of an undisturbed family tomb
near Jerusalem dating to the fourth century AD indicated the
girl, about 14, died because her pelvis was too small to permit
normal birth. <br>
