SPOT image of an area along the New South Wales&shyp;Queensland border near
the town of Goondiwindi, taken on 26 January 1996 during flooding of the
Barwon River. This is an agricultural region in which cotton is a major
crop. The smaller image on the next page shows the same area captured by
SPOT during normal flow of the river in October  1994.  <BR>
