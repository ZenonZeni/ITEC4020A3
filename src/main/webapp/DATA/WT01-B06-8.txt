		    United States District Court for the Western District of

	908 F. Supp. 640<br>
	1996

	<P>
	<STRONG> BARBARA B. CRABB</STRONG>, District Judge


	<P>
	   This is a civil action for injunctive and monetary relief brought
	pursuant to the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html"> 
	Copyright Act,</a> 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101 -
	1010, the <a href="/wisc.compcrim.html">
	Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act,</a> Wis. Stat. &#167; 943.70, and
	Wisconsin contract and tort law. The facts are not in
	dispute. Defendants Matthew Zeidenberg and Silken Mountain Web
	Services, Inc., a one-person corporation formed by Zeidenberg,
	purchased copies of plaintiff's Select Phone TM CD-ROM software
	program, downloaded telephone listings stored on the CD-ROM discs to
	Zeidenberg's computer and made the listings available to Internet
	users by placing the data onto an Internet host computer.  Plaintiff
	contends that defendants' actions constitute copyright infringement,
	breach of the express terms of the parties' software licensing
	agreement, a violation of Wisconsin's Computer Crimes Act,
	misappropriation and unfair competition. Defendants argue that the
	data they downloaded from plaintiff's Select Phone TM program were not
	protected by copyright, that defendants did not use Select Phone TM in
	a manner inconsistent with plaintiff's copyright, that they are not
	bound by the software licensing agreement and that plaintiff's state
	law claims are preempted by federal copyright law.

	<P>
	   The case is before the court on the parties' cross motions for
	summary judgment. Jurisdiction is present under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331,
	because plaintiff's copyright claim arises under federal law, and
	under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, because there is complete diversity of
	citizenship among the parties and more than $ 50,000 is at issue.

	<P>
	   I conclude that defendants are entitled to summary judgment in
	their favor.  First, defendants did not infringe plaintiff's
	copyright. Although the software plaintiff developed for its Select
	Phone TM program is protected by copyright, that protection does not
	extend to the telephone listings included on the CD-ROM discs. Second,
	defendants used the protected software for their own individual
	purposes, consistent with plaintiff's copyright, and distributed only
	unprotected data. Defendants never assented to the license agreement
	included in the Select Phone TM user guide and are not bound by
	it. Even if defendants had assented, the license agreement is
	preempted by federal copyright law to the extent plaintiff intended it
	to apply to uncopyrightable data. Finally, plaintiff's remaining state
	law claims are preempted by the Copyright Act because they are
	attempts to avoid federal copyright law.

	<P>
	   From the facts proposed by the parties, I find that the following
	facts are not in dispute.

	<P>
	<STRONG>UNDISPUTED FACTS</STRONG>

	<P>
	   Plaintiff ProCD, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its principal
	place of business in Danvers, Massachusetts. Defendant Matthew
	Zeidenberg is a Wisconsin citizen residing in Madison, Wisconsin, and
	working on a Ph.D. in computer science. Defendant Silken Mountain Web
	Services, Inc., is a Wisconsin corporation incorporated by defendant
	Zeidenberg on April 27, 1995, with himself as president and sole
	shareholder.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff spent millions of dollars creating a comprehensive,
	national directory of residential and business listings. Plaintiff
	compiled over 95,000,000 residential and commercial listings from
	approximately 3,000 publicly available telephone books. The listings
	include full names, street addresses, telephone numbers, zip codes and
	industry or "SIC" codes where appropriate.  Plaintiff sells these
	listings on CD-ROM discs under the trademark "Select Phone TM," as
	well as under other trade names and trademarks.

	<P>
	   Each of plaintiff's CD-ROM discs contains both telephone listings
	and a software program used to access, retrieve and download the
	data. Plaintiff sells Select Phone TM in boxes containing a set of
	discs and a user guide. The user guide includes a series of terms
	entitled, "Single User License Agreement."  The agreement states in
	its opening paragraph:
	 
	<P>
	<blockquote>
	Please read this license carefully before using the software or
	accessing the listings contained on the discs. By using the discs and
	the listings licensed to you, you agree to be bound by the terms of
	this License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License,
	promptly return all copies of the software, listings that may have
	been exported, the discs and the User Guide to the place where you
	obtained it.
	</blockquote>
	 
	<P>
	The license informs the user that plaintiff's software is copyrighted
	and that copying the software is authorized only for particular
	purposes and uses. Once the product is installed on the user's
	computer, the computer screens remind users that use of the product
	and the data is subject to the Single User License Agreement and that
	the products are licensed for authorized use only. Before a user can
	access the listings a field appears on the computer screen, stating:
	 
	<blockquote>
	The listings contained within this product are subject to a License
	Agreement.  Please refer to the Help menu or to the User Guide.
	 </blockquote>

	<P>
	In addition, most screens contain the following warning:
	<blockquote>
	   The listings on this product are licensed for authorized users
	only. 
	</blockquote>
	The user agreement provides that copying of the software and the data
	may be done only for individual or personal use and that distribution,
	sublicense or lease of the software or the data is prohibited. The
	agreement provides expressly that:

	<blockquote>
	You will not make the Software or the Listings in whole or in part
	available to any other user in any networked or time-shared
	environment, or transfer the Listings in whole or in part to any
	computer other than the computer used to access the Listings.
	</blockquote>

	<P>
	   The Select Phone TM box mentions the agreement in one place in
	small print.  The box does not detail the specific terms of the
	license.

	<P>
	   In late 1994, defendant Zeidenberg purchased a copy of Select Phone
	TM at a local retail store. In February or March 1995, defendant
	Zeidenberg decided he could download data from Select Phone TM and
	make it available to third parties over the Internet for commercial
	purposes. Zeidenberg purchased an updated version of Select Phone TM
	in March 1995 and in April 1995, incorporated Silken Mountain Web
	Services, Inc. for the purpose of making a database of telephone
	listings available over the Internet. In April and May 1995, after
	incorporation, Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., began assembling
	its own telephone listings database, part of which contained data from
	Select Phone TM and part of which involved data from another company's
	product. Defendants were aware of the computer screen warning message
	notifying them that Select Phone TM was subject to the agreement
	contained in the user guide. Defendants disregarded the screen
	warnings because they did not believe the license to be binding.

	<P>
	   Defendant Zeidenberg is the sole shareholder, sole employee and
	sole officer of defendant Silken Mountain Web Services,
	Inc. Defendants compiled their database by installing Select Phone TM
	on Zeidenberg's personal computer, thereby making a copy of the
	software onto Zeidenberg's computer's hard drive.  Defendants used the
	software on this hard disk copy to download data from the Select Phone
	TM discs to contribute to the corporation's own database.  Every time
	defendants downloaded data from the discs, an additional copy of
	Select Phone TM software was copied into the random access memory
	(RAM) of Zeidenberg's computer.

	<P>
	   Defendant Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., wrote its own
	computer program to allow users to search its database. No person who
	accessed the Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc. home page used or
	copied plaintiff's Select Phone TM software. The software that
	defendants created permits searches based only on name or standard
	industrial code while plaintiff's software can search a number of
	"fields," such as name, address, telephone number, area code, zip
	code, or any combination of the above.

	<P>
	   In May 1995, defendants entered into a contract with Branch
	Information Systems pursuant to which Branch provided defendants with
	access to the Internet. Defendants uploaded their database onto Branch
	Information Systems' computer and provided access to the database to
	third parties via the Internet.  Plaintiff discovered this activity
	and demanded that defendants discontinue their actions
	immediately. Zeidenberg wrote to plaintiff and admitted downloading
	listings from Select Phone TM and making some of those listings
	available over the Internet but explained that he would continue his
	project.
	<P>
	   After learning of plaintiff's displeasure, Branch Information
	Services stopped doing business with defendants. In August 1995,
	defendants entered into a contract with Ivory Tower Information
	Services for Internet access. The parties contemplated that plaintiff
	would complain and they provided in the contract that Ivory Tower
	Information Services was required to continue providing defendants
	Internet access until ordered by a court to stop.

	<P>
	   Pursuant to this contract, defendants made their database available
	over the Internet until this court issued a preliminary injunction on
	September 22, 1995.  Prior to entry of the preliminary injunction,
	defendants' database was receiving approximately 20,000 "hits" per day
	on the Internet. (A hit occurs each time a new screen is displayed on
	a user's computer screen during a search of the database. Each search
	tends to generate multiple hits.) For each search of defendants'
	database, users are permitted to extract up to 1,000 listings.
	Because the public could access defendants' database for free,
	plaintiff believed its ability to sell Select Phone TM was
	jeopardized.

	<P>
	<STRONG>OPINION    </STRONG>

	<P>
	   Plaintiff commenced this law suit in September 1995 and immediately
	sought a preliminary injunction barring defendants from distributing
	Select Phone TM telephone listings over the Internet. At the hearing
	on its motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiff's arguments for
	protection of its entrepreneurial effort were sufficiently compelling
	to secure the injunction.  Nonetheless, it was dear then, as it is
	now, that plaintiff had no valid claim to federal copyright protection
	for the raw data contained on its Select Phone TM CD-ROM discs. Now,
	after the parties have briefed the issues more fully, it has become
	evident that plaintiff cannot prevail on its copyright claim even with
	respect to its protected software and that its state law claims are
	similarly unavailing. Plaintiff's arguments boil down to the
	proposition that it is unfair and commercially destructive to allow
	defendants to take the information plaintiff assembled with a
	significant investment of time, effort and money and use it for
	commercial purposes without paying any compensation to
	plaintiff. Although the proposition has substantial equitable appeal,
	it is one that the United States Supreme Court rejected specifically
	in a nearly identical context four years ago. In <i>Feist
	Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.</i>, 499
	U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282 (1991), the court held
	that telephone listings are not protected by copyright law and denied
	the claim of a telephone company that sought to prevent competitors
	from using the data it had compiled and published in its
	directories. If this result seems perverse, the remedy lies with
	Congress. See Maureen A. O'Rourke, 41 Fed. B. News &amp; J. 511 (1994)
	(rapidly expanding Internet use will force Congress to address
	difficult question of appropriate level of protection for on-line
	fact-based databases); Jane C. Ginsburg, <i>No "Sweat"?  Copyright and
	Other Protection of Works of Information after Feist v. Rural
	Telephone</i>, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 338 (suggesting a federal
	misappropriation statute to prevent commercial copying of
	non-copyrightable databases by other compilers if public access to
	information were assured through collective licensing).

	<P>
	   It is not surprising that the recent explosive growth of the
	Internet would give rise to lawsuits concerning the ownership of the
	data available through that system. See Jane C. Ginsburg, <i>Putting
	Cars on the "Information Superhighway": Authors, Exploiters, and
	Copyright in Cyberspace,</i> 95 Colum. L.  Rev. 1466 (1995). Defendant
	Zeidenberg is not the first computer student to find himself involved
	in a legal dispute after downloading information and offering it over
	the Internet. In <i>United States v. LaMacchia</i>, 871 F. Supp. 535
	(D. Mass. 1994), a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student set
	up a computer bulletin board and encouraged his correspondents to
	upload copyrighted software that other users could download for
	free. The United States charged the student with criminal copyright
	infringement under the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167;
	1343. The district court noted the impropriety of the defendant's
	actions but held that his conduct was not punishable under the wire
	fraud statute; copyright law provided the full range of penalties for
	criminal infringement actions and copyright law did not cover
	defendant's noncommercial activities. <i>Id.</i> at 544-45. The LaMacchia
	decision appears to have generated congressional interest. On August
	4, 1995, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a bill (S. 1122) to ensure
	better copyright protection for creative works available on line. Bill
	to Stiffen Criminal Penalties for Copyright Infringement Introduced, 7
	Journal of Proprietary Rights 26 (1995). The executive branch is also
	well aware of these problems. A presidential study group formed in
	1993 recently released a report entitled, "Intellectual Property and
	the National Information Infrastructure."  The report suggests that
	the Internet will not flourish if significant protection against theft
	and copyright abuse is not offered. Guy Alvarez, <i>New Legal Issues
	on the Net</i>, Am. Law. 28, 29 (Dec. Supp.  1995). Against this
	background, I will take up plaintiff's federal copyright claim.

	<p>
	  <h2> A. Copyright Infringement</h2>

	<P>
	   Select Phone TM is comprised of two elements: 1) the software that
	allows users to access and retrieve the data contained on the CD-ROM
	discs; and 2) the data itself. The difference between these two
	elements is critical. Plaintiff contends that defendants infringed
	plaintiff's copyright when they copied and used Select Phone TM for
	purposes of commercially distributing the listings on the Internet
	because copyright protection extends to both the telephone listings
	and to its software. Defendants argue that the Select Phone TM data is
	not copyrightable but acknowledge that plaintiff has a valid copyright
	in the Select Phone TM software. Nonetheless, defendants contend,
	copyright law permits them to make a copy of the program as long as it
	is essential to their personal use of the program and is not used in a
	manner inconsistent with plaintiff's copyright.
	 
	<p>
	  <h3> 1. Select Phone TM data</h3>

	<P>
	   In <i>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service
	Co. Inc.</i>, 499 U.S.  340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282, the
	Supreme Court held that a telephone company's white pages were not
	entitled to copyright protection because the raw data contained in the
	listings were not arranged in an original manner and lacked the
	minimal degree of creativity necessary to constitute a copyrightable
	compilation of facts. <i>Id.</i> at 362. As the Court noted, <i>Feist</i>
	concerned "the interaction of two well-established propositions. The
	first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other, that
	compilations of facts generally are." <i>Id.</i> at 344. Even a modicum of
	originality may suffice to make a compilation of fact copyrightable,
	but the alphabetical listing of telephone subscriber addresses and
	telephone numbers does not achieve even this minimal degree of
	creativity. <i>Id.</i> at 345. To the argument that it was unfair for the
	publishing company to use the fruits of the telephone company's labor
	without compensating it, the Court gave short shrift. "The primary
	objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but 'to
	promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts.'" <i>Id.</i> at 349 (citing
	U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 8). In reaching this conclusion, the
	Court rejected a line of cases applying a "sweat of the brow" theory
	that offered copyright protection to factual compilations as a reward
	for the hard work that goes into compiling facts. <i>Id.</i> at 352. The
	Court explained that the 1976 Copyright Act overruled the "sweat of
	the brow" cases. <i>Id.</i> at 354-55. The Court's overruling of the sweat of
	the brow" theory can be viewed as implementation of Congressional
	intent with respect to federal copyright law.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff does not suggest that the phone listings contained in
	Select Phone are any different from those in <i>Feist</i> for purposes
	of copyright protection. As a collection of facts arranged in a
	commonplace, non-original fashion, the Select Phone TM listings
	themselves are not copyrightable. Without originality, time and effort
	do not factor into the copyright equation. <i>Feist</i>'s result may
	well serve as a disincentive to companies considering the compilation
	of factual databases, see Philip H. Miller, <i>Note, Life after Feist:
	Facts, the First Amendment and the Copyright Status of Automated
	Databases</i>, 60 Fordham L.  Rev. 507, 521-23 (1991) (<i>Feist</i>
	chills incentive to create databases), but <i>Feist</i> struck the
	"careful balance" between fact and expression in copyright law by
	allowing facts to be copied at will in order to advance the
	development of science and art. That disincentives might result was
	not considered important.
	 
	<P>
	<h3>2. Select Phone TM software</h3>

	<P>
	   Although the Select Phone TM data are not protected by federal
	copyright law, the protection attaches to the software component,
	which does represent original expression and creativity. The question
	is whether defendants infringed this copyright by copying the Select
	Phone TM software to Zeidenberg's computer's hard drive for the
	purpose of offering the telephone listings over the Internet. If, as
	defendants argue, they copied the software only for personal use and
	never distributed the software to third parties, they may be entitled
	to the exception from infringement set out in 17 U.S.C. &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   Section 501 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 501, proscribes
	any unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work. A claim for copyright
	infringement requires proof of 1) plaintiff's ownership of a valid
	copyright; and 2) defendant's copying of original elements of
	plaintiff's work. <i>Wildlife Express Corp. v. Carol Wright Sales,
	Inc.</i>, 18 F.3d 502, 507 (7th Cir. 1994). Section 117 of the
	Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 117, offers an important exception to
	restrictions on copying protected computer software. It provides, in
	relevant part:
	 
	<P>
	It is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer
	program to make.  . . another copy or adaptation of that computer
	program provided: (1) that such new copy or adaptation is created as
	an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in
	conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner.

	<P>
	   Congress passed &#167; 117 in 1980 in recognition of the fact that
	computer users might need to make copies of computer software in order
	to utilize that software. <i>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula Int'l,
	Inc.</i>, 594 F. Supp.  617, 621 (C.D. Cal.), <i>aff'd</i>, 725 F.2d 521 (9th
	Cir. 1984). Although legislative history surrounding the passage of
	&#167; 117 is sparse, it appears that Congress sought to implement the
	recommendations of CONTU, the National Commission on New Technological
	Uses of Copyright Works. <i>Aymes v. Bonelli</i>, 47 F.3d 23, 26 (2d
	Cir. 1995) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. I, at
	23 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6460, 6482). CONTU suggested
	that:
	 
	<blockquote>
	The intent of that section [117] is to provide a legitimate holder of
	a computer program with permission to do that copying of the program
	which is necessary for him to be able to use it in his computer
	without running afoul of possible infringement actions.
	</blockquote>
	<i>Apple Computer</i>, 594 F. Supp. at 621 (citing CONTU Meeting
	No. 19 at 98-99 (Jan.  1978)).

	<P>
	   The parties' dispute focuses on the scope and meaning of the term,
	"essential step." Plaintiff would interpret it as not extending to the
	copying of Select Phone TM onto a computer's hard drive. Plaintiff
	contends that making a copy of Select Phone TM on a hard drive was not
	"essential" to defendants' use of the program: they could have
	utilized the program by booting it into RAM memory every time they
	desired to use it. According to plaintiff, hard drive copies are not
	protected under &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory and represents that part
	of a computer's memory in which data and computer programs can be
	recorded temporarily. When a computer is turned off, the information
	stored in RAM is lost. See <i>Apple Computer</i>, 594 F. Supp. at
	622. A number of courts have determined that RAM copies of a computer
	program are copies for the purposes of &#167; 117. See <i>MAI
	Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.</i>, 991 F.2d 511, 518 (9th Cir.
	1993), <i>cert. denied</i>, 126 L. Ed. 2d 640, 114 S. Ct. 671 (1994);
	<i>Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc., v. MAI
	Sys. Corp.</i>, 845 F. Supp. 356, 363, 364 n.9 (E.D. Va. 1994)
	(collecting cases); <i>Apple Computer</i>, 594 F. Supp. at 622.
	However, none of these courts has held that hard drive copies made for
	an owner's individual use are not equally "essential" under the rubric
	of &#167; 117.  Plaintiff's logic would lead to the conclusion that
	any copying of a computer program onto the owner's hard drive would
	constitute copyright infringement unless the program developer gave
	the owner specific authorization to make a hard drive copy. This
	conclusion conflicts with both basic patterns of computer use in the
	1990s and the spirit of &#167; 117. The day has passed when it was
	necessary to insert a floppy disk in a disk drive any time a user
	wanted access to a particular program. Today, computer users store
	many of their programs on hard drives and access them from that part
	of the computer's permanent memory. Programs on CD-ROM can be used
	more efficiently by installing the program software on a hard drive
	and then using that hard drive copy in conjunction with a disc
	inserted in the CD-ROM disc drive. Limiting those copies that are
	considered "essential" under &#167; 117 to RAM copies would limit the
	use of computer hard drive copies, flout the purposes of &#167; 117
	and diminish the sales appeal of any new program that took advantage
	of such protection. See Robert A.  Kreiss, <i>Section 117 of the
	Copyright Act</i>, 1991 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 1497, 1524-26 (1991) (contending
	that position that hard drive copies are not "essential" for purposes
	of &#167; 117 would create incredible frustration by requiring the
	continual swapping of floppy disks and should be rejected as "rather
	ridiculous").
	  

	<P>
	   Section 117 is intended to allow persons in rightful possession of
	copies of a program to use them freely without fear of exposure to
	copyright liability.  <i>Aymes</i>, 47 F.3d at 26 (citing CONTU Final
	Report at 31 (1978)). If copyright law prevented computer users from
	making hard drive copies, they would not be able to use their
	purchased programs without fear of infringement. RAM copies may be
	essential copies of a computer program but hard drive copies are just
	as essential for the effective use of today's computer software.

	<P>
	   Copies permitted by &#167; 117 must be made only for an owner's
	personal use, <i>Aymes</i>, 47 F.3d at 26. Odd as it may seem, given
	defendants' subsequent commercial use of the telephone data, the
	undisputed fact is that defendants made no copies of plaintiff's
	software except for their own personal use.  Defendants did not use
	the software in an unauthorized fashion as suggested by plaintiffs'
	citations to <i>Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp.</i>, 983 F.2d 824 (8th
	Cir. 1992) and <i>Major League Baseball Promotion Corp. v. Colour-Tex,
	Inc.</i>, 729 F. Supp. 1035 (D. N.J. 1990). They used the
	copyrightable software portion of the product only to access and
	download the telephone listings data. Defendants did not offer this
	software over the Internet. Instead, they created a new search program
	to allow Internet users to access the data. In distributing only the
	uncopyrightable data over the Internet, defendants did not disqualify
	themselves from the infringement exception contained in &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   In reaching the conclusion that defendants did not misuse the
	copyrightable component of the Select Phone TM program, it is not
	necessary to adopt the broad proposition asserted by the defendant in
	<i>Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.</i>, 847 F.2d 255, 261 (5th
	Cir. 1988), that software purchasers are free under &#167; 117 to make
	copies of copyrighted software for purposes not intended by the
	copyright owner. In <i>Vault</i>, the defendant used the plaintiff's
	software diskettes, designed to prevent the unauthorized duplication
	of programs placed on them, for the express purpose of devising a
	means to defeat the diskettes' protective function, rather than for
	their intended protective purposes. <i>Id.</i> The plaintiff asserted that
	the phrase "and that it is used in no other manner" in &#167; 117
	means that the statute's protection should not extend to copies made
	for purposes other than those for which the program was
	intended. <i>Id.</i> The court held that the defendant did not infringe the
	plaintiff's copyright, finding that &#167; 117 contains no language to
	suggest that the copy it permits must be put to the use intended by
	the copyright owner and that no dear congressional intent existed to
	the contrary. <i>Id.</i> Here, defendants used Select Phone TM exactly as
	plaintiff intended: to access and download data. There is no obvious
	reason not to extend the &#167; 117 exception to parties who copy a
	copyrighted software program for its intended purpose and use it in
	that manner.

	<P>
	   Although plaintiff acknowledges the distinction between the
	copyrighted and noncopyrighted portions of Select Phone TM, it
	disregards that distinction to some extent. For example, plaintiff
	argues that defendants' actions are tantamount to downloading all of
	Lexis's judicial opinions and offering them for free over the
	Internet. Plaintiff fails to recognize that although federal cases are
	not copyrightable, at least one court has held that legal database
	companies like Lexis may arrange those opinions in such a manner as to
	receive copyright protection. See <i>West Publication Co. v. Mead Data
	Central, Inc.</i>, 799 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir. 1986), <i>cert. denied</i>, 479
	U.S. 1070, 93 L. Ed. 2d 1010, 107 S. Ct. 962 (1987) (West's
	arrangement of legal decisions entails enough intellectual labor and
	originality to receive copyright protection); but see Craig Joyce and
	L. Ray Patterson, <i>Monopolizing the Law: The Scope of Copyright
	Protection for Law Reports and Statutory Compilations</i>, 36 UCLA
	L. Rev. 719 (1989) (criticizing the West decision). Unlike West's
	arrangement of judicial opinions, plaintiff's arrangement of telephone
	listings lacks the minimal level of creativity necessary to gamer
	copyright protection. See Feist 499 U.S.  at 362. Although plaintiff's
	software is protected by copyright law, its compiled data are
	not. Because defendants used the software only to download and access
	the data and did not further distribute this copyrightable
	information, their actions are protected by &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   Defendants contend that the fair use doctrine of 17 U.S.C. &#167;
	107 provides them the right to make an intermediate copy of a
	protected work in order to get at the uncopyrighted parts of a
	work. See <i>Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.</i>, 977 F.2d
	1510, 1520 (9th Cir. 1992); <i>Atari Games Corp. v.  Nintendo of
	America, Inc.</i>, 975 F.2d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The fair use
	doctrine establishes a defense to an otherwise valid copyright
	infringement claim. <i>Sega</i>, 977 F.2d at 1521. Because I have
	determined that defendants are protected from a copyright infringement
	claim by &#167; 117, it is unnecessary to consider whether they should
	receive &#167; 107 protection as well.

	<P>
	   <h2>B. Software License Agreement</h2>

	<P>
	   Before marketing Select Phone TM, plaintiff recognized the
	potential limitations of copyright law and included an agreement in
	the software package that sought to impose limitations concerning the
	distribution and use of the telephone listings. Plaintiff is not the
	first software producer to seek to protect itself in this
	fashion. Software companies have included such agreements, commonly
	known as "shrinkwrap licenses," with their products since the advent
	of mass market software. (The term "shrinkwrap" refers to the
	transparent plastic in which mass market software is encased. Mark
	A. Lemley, <i>Intellectual Property and Shrinkwrap Licenses</i>, 68
	S. Cal. L. Rev. 1239, 1241 (1995)). Shrinkwrap licenses are intended
	to take the place of any bargains or agreements between mass market
	software producers and users, because the typical software transaction
	does not involve bargained agreements concerning use limitations, but
	a purchase made by a computer user at a retail store or through the
	mail, with little discussion or bargaining between the producer and
	the user. In placing a shrinkwrap license provision on its software
	product, the producer seeks to 1) prohibit unauthorized copies; 2)
	prohibit software rental; 3) prohibit reverse engineering and
	modifications to the software; 4) limit the use of software to one
	central processing unit; 5) disclaim warranties; and 6) limit
	liability. Lloyd L. Rich, <i>Mass Market Software and the Shrinkwrap
	License</i>, 23 Colo. Law. 1321 (1994).

	<P>
	   The widespread use of shrinkwrap licenses has generated intense
	interest in academic and intellectual property fields, but
	surprisingly little litigation.  See <i>Step-Saver Data Sys.,
	Inc. v. Wyse Technology</i>, 939 F.2d 91 (3d Cir. 1991); <i>Vault
	Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.</i>, 847 F.2d 255; <i>Arizona Retail
	Sys., Inc. v.  Software Link, Inc.</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759
	(D. Ariz. 1993). Most commentators view shrinkwrap licenses as being
	of questionable validity, primarily because software users do not have
	an opportunity to bargain over their terms.  See Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68
	S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1263 n. 107 (citing articles). In addition to
	raising issues of enforceability, shrinkwrap licenses also pose
	important questions about the extent to which individual contract
	provisions can supplement or expand federal copyright protection. It
	is important to analyze these licenses carefully, not only to
	determine their validity but also to ascertain whether they are
	preempted by the Copyright Act.

	<p> 
	  <h3> 1. The user agreement</h3>
	<p>
	   In addressing shrinkwrap licenses, the starting point is how to
	treat a sale of software: as a sale of goods under Article II of the
	Uniform Commercial Code or as a "license" to the user. Most courts
	have chosen the first route and have applied the U.C.C. to mass market
	software transactions. Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68 S.  Cal. L. Rev. at 1244 n.23
	(citing numerous federal and state law cases); but see <i>Microsoft
	Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics, Inc.</i>, 846
	F. Supp. 208 (E.D. N.Y. 1994). Commentators agree that the
	U.C.C. should apply to computer software transactions. See Bonna Lynn
	Horovitz, <i>Note, Computer Software as a Good Under the Uniform
	Commercial Code: Taking a Byte out of the Intangibility Myth</i>, 65
	B.U.L. Rev. 129 (1985); Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev.  at 1244
	n.23. I will not address this issue in detail but note only that there
	are sound reasons for treating a software transaction as a sale of
	goods under the U.C.C. rather than as a license: purchasers of mass
	market software do not make periodic payments but instead pay a single
	purchase price, the software company does not retain title for the
	purpose of a security interest and no set expiration date exists for
	the "licensed" right. See Gary W. Hamilton &amp; Jeffrey C. Hood,
	<i>The Shrink-Wrap License--Is It Really Necessary?</i>, 10 Computer
	Law 16 (1993). Plaintiff cites only <i>Microsoft Corp.</i>, 846
	F. Supp. 208, in support of its characterization of the transaction as
	a license. The opinion is not persuasive. The court did not address
	the applicability of the U.C.C. in holding that Microsoft licenses
	rather than sells its products. <i>Id.</i> at 213. Plaintiff is no more
	convincing when it argues that the courts have applied the U.C.C. to
	software transactions only when a sale of hardware is involved. See,
	e.g., <i>Advent Sys. Ltd. v. Unisys Corp.</i>, 925 F.2d 670, 676 (3d
	Cir. 1991)(".  . . we hold that software is a "good" within the
	definition in the Code). In analyzing the parties' transaction, I will
	apply the U.C.C., as adopted by Wisconsin. (For ease of uniform
	reference, I will cite the relevant U.C.C.  provisions, pointing out
	the specific Wisconsin statutory provisions where necessary.)

	<P>
	   Before examining the application of the U.C.C. to plaintiff's user
	agreement, I note two cases that plaintiff cites in support of its
	argument that its user agreement is binding on
	defendants. <i>Barazzotto v. Intelligent Sys., Inc.</i>, 40 Ohio
	App. 3d 117, 532 N.E.2d 148 (1987); <i>McCrimmon v. Tandy Corp.</i>,
	202 Ga. App.  233, 414 S.E.2d 15 (1991), <i>cert. denied</i>, 1992 Ga. LEXIS
	88 (Feb. 4, 1992).  <i>Barazzotto</i> and <i>McCrimmon</i> deserve
	only passing mention because neither addresses the issues of this case
	directly. In <i>Barazzotto</i>, the court held that a manufacturer's
	disclaimer of liability appearing on software packaging was not
	binding as to the retail seller. <i>Id.</i> at 120, 532 N.E.2d at 151. The
	court did not address whether that disclaimer was valid as to the
	software manufacturer.  In <i>McCrimmon</i>, the court enforced a
	limited warranty included by a retail seller on the back of a sales
	receipt when the warranty was available for customer inspection prior
	to purchase, noting that it was the customer's responsibility to read
	the receipt when it was tendered to him at the time of
	purchase. <i>Id.</i> at 236, 414 S.E.2d at 18.

	<P>
	   Defendants did not have the opportunity to inspect the user
	agreement before purchasing Select Phone TM because it was inside the
	packaging box and accordingly, they cannot be held to the same
	standards as those applied in McCrimmon. Plaintiff's argument that
	defendants had the opportunity to inspect the Select Phone TM user
	agreement after their first purchase and thus should be held to their
	knowledge of the agreement on their second and third purchases will be
	addressed later.
	<P>
	   The parties dispute how their transaction should be analyzed under
	Article II of the U.C.C. and suggest three possibilities. The
	agreement could be considered an offer subject to the right of
	inspection under &#167; 2-206, a written confirmation of a previously
	established contract under &#167; 2-207, or a proposed modification of
	a contract under &#167; 2-209. Plaintiff argues that &#167; 2-206
	should apply, contending that acceptance did not occur at the moment
	of payment but was subject to defendants' right of inspection and
	revocation that they did not exercise. In defendants' view, the
	contract for the sale of Select Phone TM was completed at the time of
	sale and the license represents additional terms to which they cannot
	be bound under either &#167; 2-207 or &#167; 2-209.
	 <p>
	  <h4> a. Section 2-206</h4>

	<P>
	   Section 2-206, Wis. Stat. &#167; 402.206, sets forth basic notions
	of offer and acceptance. Under &#167; 2-206, the placement of a
	product such as Select Phone on a store shelf constitutes an
	offer. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Barker v. Allied Supermarket</i>, 596 P.2d 870
	(Okla. 1979). Acceptance occurs in any manner reasonable under the
	circumstances. &#167; 2-206(1)(a). Defendants accepted plaintiff's
	offer to sell Select Phone TM in a reasonable manner at the moment
	they purchased the product by exchanging money for the
	program. <i>Peeters v. State</i>, 154 Wis. 111, 142 N.W.  181 (1913)
	(sales contract results when customer pays purchase price and departs
	with item). Paying for a software program is a reasonable manner of
	accepting the offer implicit in the program's display on a store
	shelf. Defendants' payment for the program constitutes conduct
	sufficient to create a contract under &#167; 2-204, Wis. Stat. &#167;
	402.204, the U.C.C. provision governing initial contract formation,
	which states that:
	 
	<blockquote>
	A contract for the sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient
	to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes
	the existence of such a contract.
	 </blockquote>
	<P>
	Plaintiff cannot reasonably expect that further action from defendants
	would be required to make that sales contract binding. The purchase of
	the product was sufficient to show agreement between the parties.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff argues that defendants' acceptance of the software was
	contingent upon their rights of inspection, rejection or revocation,
	but &#167;&#167; 2-204 and 2-206 do not mention any such
	rights. Sections 2-602 and 2-608, Wis. Stat. &#167;&#167; 402.602 and
	402.608, offer such rights, yet these sections do not apply in this
	context.  Section 2-602 grants buyers receiving a tender or delivery
	of goods an opportunity to inspect the goods before accepting. It
	guarantees that buyers will not be saddled with goods that have been
	damaged or are otherwise unsatisfactory upon arrival, but it does not
	create a right to inspect additional written contractual
	terms. Inspection of new contractual terms is covered under other
	sections of the U.C.C. See U.C.C. &#167;&#167; 2-207 and
	2-209. Section 2-608 allows a purchaser to revoke his acceptance when
	the goods' nonconformity with the contract substantially impairs their
	value. <i>H.B. Fuller Co. v. Kinetic Sys., Inc.</i>, 932 F.2d 681 (7th
	Cir. 1991). Again, the provision exists to offer buyers some form of
	protection when purchased items do not serve their intended purpose.

	<P>
	   Defendants do not contend that the Select Phone TM product failed
	to work as they thought it would. Rather, their dispute concerns the
	manner in which the contract limits their use of the product and, as
	such, is more appropriately viewed under &#167; 2-207 or &#167;
	2-209. Plaintiff cites one case in support of its argument that &#167;
	2-206 should apply, <i>Sherkate Sahami Khass Rapol v. Henry R. Jahn
	&amp; Son, Inc.</I>, 531 F. Supp. 1048, 1054-1055 (S.D. N.Y. 1982),
	rev'd on other grounds, 701 F.2d 1049 (2d Cir. 1983), but the case
	does not bolster its argument. <i>Sherkate</i> only reiterates the
	language of the U.C.C. as it applies to shipments of goods and does
	not suggest that these provisions should apply to the inspection of
	contractual terms.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>b. Sections 2-207 and 2-209</h4>

	<P>
	   The application of sections 2-207 and 2-209,
	Wis. Stat. &#167;&#167; 402.207 and 402.209, is best analyzed by
	examining <i>Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc.</i>, 939 F.2d 91, and
	<i>Arizona Retail Sys., Inc.</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the two leading
	cases on the enforceability of shrinkwrap licenses. Neither case
	involved the type of transaction between a computer user and a
	software producer that took place in this case when defendants
	purchased mass market software at a retail outlet.  Nonetheless, in
	both cases, the courts reached the conclusion that the shrinkwrap
	licenses at issue should be invalidated. The cases provide insight
	into the application of the U.C.C. to the Select Phone TM user
	agreement.

	<P>
	   The facts of <i>Step-Saver</i> and <i>Arizona Retail</i> are quite
	similar. Each case involved a series of transactions between retail
	computer stores and a software company named <i>The Software Link,
	Inc.</i> In <i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, the retail store
	telephoned The Software Link and offered to purchase a specific
	software program. The Software Link accepted the offers over the
	telephone and agreed to ship copies of the program. During these
	discussions, The Software Link never mentioned any additional terms of
	the sales contract beyond the agreement to ship the software in
	exchange for monetary consideration.  <i>Id.</i> at 96. However, when the
	software packages arrived they were wrapped in shrinkwrap plastic upon
	which was affixed a box-top license setting out a number of terms
	purporting to disclaim warranties and limit remedies. Problems arose
	with the program and Step-Saver sued to recover damages.

	<P>
	   The factual background of <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759,
	differs only in the initial transaction between the retail store,
	Arizona Retail, and The Software Link. After Arizona Retail first
	telephoned to inquire about a specific software program, The Software
	Link sent two copies of the software, an evaluative copy and a "live"
	copy. Arizona Retail spent two hours using the evaluative copy,
	determined it wanted to purchase the program, and then opened the live
	copy upon which was attached the box-top license. <i>Id.</i> at 761.
	Subsequently, Arizona Retail purchased additional copies of the
	software through telephone transactions virtually identical to those
	in <i>Step Saver</i>. The court considered the initial transaction
	separately from the subsequent transactions, explaining that the
	initial offer took place when The Software Link sent a live copy of
	the software with the evaluation diskette. <i>Id.</i> at 764.  The live copy
	was sealed in an envelope upon which was added the statement that a
	user acknowledges "acceptance of this product, and [consents] to all
	the provisions [of] the Limited Use License Agreement" by opening the
	envelope. The court held that Arizona Retail had accepted The Software
	Link's offer and a contract was formed when it opened the
	envelope. <i>Id.</i> The terms of the box-top license were incorporated into
	that contract because they were visible on the outside of the envelope
	and Arizona Retail had been exposed to them before the contract was
	formed. <i>Id.</i> at 763.
	<P>
	   The court distinguished this situation from the subsequent
	transactions in that case and from the transactions in
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, in all of which a contract was formed
	and complete at the moment the parties agreed to order and ship
	goods. In the subsequent transactions, the agreement was formed before
	Arizona Retail became aware of The Software Link's insistence on the
	terms of the box-top license and thus those terms could not be
	considered part of the initial offer. 831 F. Supp. at 763-66. Even
	though Arizona Retail knew that The Software Link had imposed box-top
	license provisions in the first sale, the court held that the store
	did not know that The Software Link would impose box-top license
	provisions when it placed subsequent orders because The Software Link
	did not mention any such terms in the parties' telephone
	conversations. <i>Id.</i>  at 764. The court's holding accorded with the
	holding of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d at 105-06, that the box-top license terms
	could not be considered part of The Software Link's initial offer
	because Step-Saver was not apprised of those terms before the
	agreement to order and ship software.

	<P>
	   Because the box-top licenses were not part of the agreements to
	order and ship software, both the <i>Arizona Retail</i> and
	<i>Step-Saver</i> courts considered other methods of analyzing the
	application of the licenses' terms to the parties' contracts. In
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, the court analyzed the terms under &#167; 2-207,
	<i>id.</i> at 98 in <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court
	determined that &#167; 2-209 was a better fit. <i>Id.</i>  at 765.

	<P>
	   <i>Step-Saver</i> and <i>Arizona Retail</i> suggest two
	possibilities for analyzing the alleged contract between plaintiff and
	defendants. One view is that the terms of the user agreement were
	incorporated into plaintiff's sales offer by the reference on the
	outside of the Select Phone TM package. If this is the case, then
	defendants are bound to the terms of the agreement because they opened
	and used the product, just as Arizona Retail was bound initially to
	the terms of The Software Link's box-top license. The other view is
	that the user agreement was not included in plaintiff's sales offer
	and represents either a proposed modification to the sales agreement
	under &#167; 2-209 or a written confirmation of a previously
	established contract under &#167; 2-207. Section 2-207 governs
	situations in which parties have reached a general agreement but have
	yet to agree on specific terms desired by one of the
	parties. <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. at 763. Section 2-209
	controls the modification of contracts after their formation.  <i>Id.</i>

	<P>
	    In <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court considered
	the terms of the box-top license binding on Arizona Retail in the
	initial transaction because those terms were visible to Arizona Retail
	before it opened the software envelope. It is evident from the court's
	citation to <i>McCrimmon v. Tandy Corporation</i>, 202 Ga. App. 233,
	414 S.E.2d 15, in which a purchaser was held to a warranty disclaimer
	he had the opportunity to read before making his purchase, that the
	court believed that the terms must be made apparent before contract
	formation. 831 F. Supp. at 764, 765 n.3 (warranty disclaimers in
	<i>McCrimmon</i> made apparent to buyer at time of acceptance rather
	than afterwards). In <i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, the court
	acknowledged the importance of exposure to specific terms when it
	noted the "well-established distinction between conspicuous
	disclaimers made available before the contract is formed and
	disclaimers made available only after the contract is formed." <i>Id.</i> at
	104-105, n. 45.
	<P>
	   The terms of the Select Phone TM user agreement were not presented
	to defendants at the time of sale. The sole reference to the user
	agreement was a disclosure in small print at the bottom of the
	package, stating that defendants were subject to the terms and
	conditions of the enclosed license agreement.  Defendants did not
	receive the Opportunity to inspect or consider those terms. Mere
	reference to the terms at the time of initial contract formation does
	not present buyers an adequate opportunity to decide whether they are
	acceptable. They must be able to read and consider the terms in their
	entirety.  The potential incorporation of the terms can occur only
	after the purchaser opens the package and has a reasonable opportunity
	to inspect the user agreement. Sections 2-207 or 2-209 control that
	incorporation.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff argues that even if the user agreement was not
	incorporated into its initial sales offer, defendants should have
	known about the user agreement after the initial purchase and should
	be subject to its terms in subsequent purchases. In <i>Step-Saver</i>,
	939 F.2d at 104, the court rejected this argument, recognizing that
	exposure to proposed terms in previous transactions did not change the
	fact that these terms were not agreed to at the time of subsequent
	contract formations. The court explained that it would be unjust to
	allow a seller that failed in its attempt to incorporate certain terms
	into an initial contract to hold the buyer to the same terms in
	subsequent transactions without first receiving the buyer's express
	assent. The court held that it was reasonable for Step-Saver to
	believe from The Software Link's shipment of software without any
	mention of terms that the manufacturer had agreed to do business
	without the box-top license terms. <i>Id.</i> Surprisingly, in <i>Arizona
	Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court did not confront the
	significance of Arizona Retail's knowledge of the box-top license
	terms as applied to the subsequent software transactions although it
	had drawn a distinction between the initial and subsequent
	transactions. Nonetheless, the court's opinion makes apparent its
	belief that express assent is required to terms that are not
	specifically made part of an agreement. <i>Id.</i> at 766.

	<P>
	   The decision on this issue is a dose call. Defendants may have
	known the exact terms of the user agreement at the time of their
	second and third purchases of Select Phone TM. In that case, I would
	not find it inherently "unjust," as did the court in
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, to hold a party to the terms a seller incorporates
	into a standard form contract. However, I would agree with that court
	that it is unwise to hold a buyer to those terms when software
	companies are free to change the terms of their shrinkwrap licenses
	between initial and later versions of their products. Like any other
	parties to a contract, computer users should be given the opportunity
	to review the terms to which they will be bound each and every time
	they contract. Although not all users will read the terms anew each
	time under such circumstances, it does not follow that they should not
	be given this opportunity. Defendants cannot be held to the user
	agreement included with the second and third copies of Select Phone TM
	they purchased merely because they were aware of the terms included
	with the initial version. Each software purchase creates a new
	contract. Computer users should be given a fresh opportunity to review
	any terms to which those contracts will bind them.

	<P>
	   It is unnecessary to consider in detail the distinctions between
	&#167;&#167; 2-207 and 2-209 because the terms of the user agreement
	are not binding on defendants regardless which section is applied. See
	<i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. at 766 (Arizona Retail not bound
	by license agreement under either &#167; 2-207 or &#167; 2-209). The
	court determined that the license agreement was best seen as a
	proposed modification of the parties' sales contract under &#167;
	2-209 and ruled that the terms of that agreement were not effective
	because Arizona Retail had never assented to them. <i>Id.</i> at 765. Section
	2-209 requires the express assent of a party to any proposed
	contractual modifications. Assent cannot be inferred from a party's
	conduct in continuing with an agreement. <i>Id.</i>  at 759;
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d at 98-99. In this case, defendants did not
	assent expressly to the terms of the user agreement. Their continued
	use of the Select Phone TM product has no bearing on whether they
	accepted the user agreement.  Under these circumstances, &#167; 2-209
	does not warrant the incorporation of the user agreement into the
	parties' initial sales agreement.

	<P>
	   In <i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, the court discussed at length
	the application of &#167; 2-207 to the software transactions between
	Step-Saver and The Software Link, noting that &#167; 2-207 was
	intended to end a "battle of forms" between merchants that took place
	under common law because a party was bound to the terms of the last
	sent form if it proceeded to perform the contract after receiving that
	form. <i>Id.</i> at 99. Under &#167; 2-207(2), the terms proposed in such
	forms are to be considered proposals for addition to the contract.
	These terms become binding on merchants unless certain important
	conditions are met. Section 2-207 is silent on how additional terms
	should be construed in a transaction between a merchant and a
	consumer. Keeping in mind the legislative goal behind &#167; 2-207, it
	is improbable to think that the drafters wanted consumers to be held
	to additional proposed terms in situations in which merchants were
	given protection. Because &#167; 2-207 is concerned primarily with
	contract wars between merchants, it is preferable to analyze the
	Select Phone TM user agreement under &#167; 2-209. Nonetheless,
	applying &#167; 2-207 to the consumer transaction in this case still
	leads to the conclusion that the user agreement was not binding on
	defendants because they never agreed to it expressly and it never
	became part of the agreement between the parties.

	<P>
	   I conclude that because defendants did not have the opportunity to
	bargain or object to the proposed user agreement or even review it
	before purchase and they did not assent to the terms explicitly after
	they learned of them, they are not bound by the user agreement.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>c. Draft section 2-2203</h4>

	<P>
	   The American Law Institute, drafters of proposed new
	U.C.C. provisions,
	   has suggested a provision, &#167; 2-2203, that would make standard form
	licenses enforceable if:
	 
	<blockquote>
	<P>
	(a) . . . prior to or within a reasonable time after beginning to use
	the intangible pursuant to an agreement, the party
	 
	<P>
	(1) signs or otherwise by its behavior manifests assent to a standard
	form license; and
	 
	<P>
	(2) had an opportunity to review the terms of the license before
	manifesting assent, whether or not it actually reviewed the terms.
	 </blockquote>
	</p>
	<P>
	Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1293. This proposal is evidence
	that the American Law Institute views current law as insufficient to
	guarantee the enforcement of standard form contracts such as
	shrinkwrap licenses. The draft provision appears to introduce a &#167;
	2-206 type of inspection, rejection and revocation element into
	shrinkwrap contracts and thereby place significant responsibility on
	buyers to actively reject those terms by returning the goods if they
	find the terms unacceptable. Louisiana and Illinois enacted similar
	legislative schemes in the 1980s but they are no longer in
	effect. David A.  Rice, <i>Public Goods, Private Contract and Public
	Policy: Federal Preemption of Software License Prohibitions Against
	Reverse Engineering</i>, 53 U.  Pitt. L. Rev. 543, 565 (1992). The
	Louisiana statute was partially invalidated by the Court of Appeals
	for the Fifth Circuit on federal preemption grounds, <i>Vault
	Corp.</i>, 847 F.2d at 270, and Illinois repealed its law. <i>Id.</i> If the
	draft provision gains substantial acceptance among the states, the
	application of the U.C.C. to shrinkwrap licenses may no longer require
	detailed consideration. In that event, federal preemption concerns
	will become even more prominent. I turn next to that issue.

	<P>
	   <h2>C. Preemption of State Law Claims</h2>

	<P>
	   Section 301 governs preemption of state law claims that conflict
	with the federal copyright policies embedded in the federal Copyright
	Act. 17 U.S.C. &#167; 301. It comes into play only if both of two
	conditions are satisfied: 1) the work in which the state law right is
	asserted comes within the "subject matter" of copyright, as specified
	in 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 102 or 103; and 2) the state law right
	asserted is equivalent to any of the rights specified in 17
	U.S.C. &#167; 106.  <i>Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball
	Players</i>, 805 F.2d 663, 674 (7th Cir.  1986).
	 
	<p>
	  <h3> 1. Subject matter of copyright</h3>

	<P>
	   Plaintiff begins with the proposition that if defendants are
	correct in arguing that the Select Phone TM data compilation cannot be
	copyrighted, it follows as a matter of course that the data are
	outside the subject matter of the federal copyright law. The line is
	not so clear as plaintiff would draw it.  Section 102 of the Copyright
	Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102, extends copyright protection to original
	works of authorship including literary, musical, dramatic and a number
	of other types of works. Factual compilations are included within the
	subject matter of copyright by 17 U.S.C. &#167; 103 and are defined
	elsewhere in the act as a collection of data or materials arranged in
	such a way as to constitute an original work of authorship. 17
	U.S.C. &#167; 101.

	<P>
	   The law in this circuit is that the "subject matter of copyright"
	includes works that fit within the general subject matter of
	&#167;&#167; 102 and 103, whether or not the works qualify for actual
	protection. See <i>Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball
	Players</i>. 805 F.2d 663. The question in the <i>Baltimore
	Orioles</i> case was whether major league baseball clubs owned
	exclusive rights to the televised performances of the players during
	major league baseball games. <i>Id.</i> at 665. The players argued that they
	had a state law right of publicity in their performances; the clubs
	contended that federal copyright law preempted this state law
	right. The court rejected the players' argument that because their
	performances lacked sufficient creativity and were not copyrightable,
	they fell outside the subject matter of copyright. In concluding that
	a work can fall within the subject matter of copyright even if it
	lacks any creativity or originality, the court relied on a House of
	Representatives report: "As long as a work fits within one of the
	general subject matter categories of section 102 and
	103,. . . [section 301(a)] prevents the States from protecting it even
	if it fails to achieve Federal copyright because it is too minimal or
	lacking in originality to qualify." <i>Id.</i> at 676 (citing
	H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 51 (1976), reprinted in 1976
	U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5747).

	<P>
	   Other courts have ruled similarly. See <i>Harper &amp; Row
	Publishers, Inc. v.  Nation Enterprises</i>, 723 F.2d 195, 201 (2d
	Cir. 1983), <i>rev'd on other grounds</i>, 471 U.S. 539, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588,
	105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985) (accepting opposite position would allow states
	to "expand the perimeters of copyright protection to their own liking"
	and would "run directly afoul of one of the Copyright Act's central
	purposes, to 'avoid the development of any vague borderline areas
	between State and Federal protection.'" (citing H.R. Rep. No.  1476,
	1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5746)); <i>Ehat v. Tanner</i>, 780 F.2d 876, 877
	(10th Cir.  1985), <i>cert. denied</i> 479 U.S. 820, 93 L. Ed. 2d 39, 107
	S. Ct. 86 (1986) (Congress stated expressly that &#167; 301 is
	intended to prevent "the States from protecting . . . [a work] even if
	it fails to achieve Federal statutory copyright because it is too
	minimal or lacking in originality to qualify") (citing
	H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5747). See also <i>Nash
	v. CBS, Inc.</i>, 704 F. Supp. 823, 832 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (state law
	claims do not avoid preemption simply because they are based upon
	improper use of uncopyrightable material contained in works properly
	subject to copyright).

	<P>
	    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit touched on this issue
	in <i>United States Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, Inc.</i>,
	665 F.2d 781 (7th Cir.  1981). The court held that a misappropriation
	claim was not preempted because it did not fall within the realm of
	federal copyright law. <i>Id.</i> at 786 n.6.  Although the Court of Appeals
	for the Seventh Circuit did not mention <i>United States Trotting
	Ass'n</i> in <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, its decision in the latter case
	seems to overrule any suggestion in <i>United States Trotting
	Ass'n</i> that uncopyrightable material cannot fall within the subject
	matter of copyright law.

	<P>
	   In <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d 663, the court muted the full
	impact of its holding by noting that regardless of the originality of
	the players' performances, the recordings of the games were original
	enough to come within the scope of copyright law because of the
	creative contributions of the announcers. <i>Id.</i> at 676. Plaintiff would
	like this court to believe that by hedging its decision in this
	manner, the court left open the question whether uncopyrightable
	material can fall within the subject matter of copyright. Its argument
	is unpersuasive in light of the court's reliance on explicit
	congressional intent and the holdings of the other circuits.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff notes that the Nimmer treatise criticizes the court's
	holding in <i>Baltimore Orioles</i> on this issue, proposing that it
	was confused over which works fall within the subject matter of
	copyright. David Nimmer &amp; Melville B.  Nimmer, Nimmer on
	Copyright, &#167; 1.01[B] at 1-24, n.101 (1995). The Nimmers' views
	notwithstanding, <i>Baltimore Orioles</i> is still good case law in
	this circuit and I am bound to apply it.

	<P>
	   The telephone listings on the Select Phone TM CD-ROM discs are a
	compilation of facts that would qualify for copyright protection under
	&#167; 103 if they were sufficiently original; that they lack the
	necessary originality does not affect their status as coming within
	the subject matter of copyright. Baltimore Orioles compels the
	conclusion that plaintiff's uncopyrightable compilation of telephone
	data satisfies the first prong of the preemption test.
	 
	<P>
	<h3>2. Equivalency of asserted rights to rights specified in &#167;
	106</h3>

	<P>
	   A right is equivalent to one of the rights set forth in &#167; 106
	if it "is infringed by the mere act of reproduction, performance,
	distribution or display." <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 677
	(citing Nimmer, <i>supra</i>, &#167; 1.01[B][1]). To avoid preemption, a
	cause of action defined by state law must incorporate an "extra
	element" beyond those necessary to prove copyright
	infringement. <i>Trandes Corp. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co.</i>, 996 F.2d
	655, 659 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 126 L. Ed. 2d 377, 114 S. Ct. 443
	(1993). Section 106 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 106, grants
	the owner of a copyright exclusive rights of reproduction and
	distribution. The causes of action on which plaintiff's state law
	claims are based are designed to protect these same reproduction and
	distribution rights. As such, plaintiff's asserted state law rights
	are equivalent to rights provided by &#167; 106 and its state law
	claims are preempted under &#167; 301.
	 
	<p>
	  <h4> a. Contract claim</h4>

	<P>
	   Several federal courts have held that breach of contract claims are
	not preempted by &#167; 301 of the Copyright Act because breach of
	contract is not a cause of action "equivalent" to a copyright
	infringement claim. <i>National Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Computer
	Associates Int'l Inc.</i>, 991 F.2d 426, 433 (8th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>,
	126 L. Ed. 2d 136, 114 S. Ct. 176 (1993); <i>Taquino v.  Teledyne
	Monarch Rubber</i>, 893 F.2d 1488, 1501 (5th Cir. 1990); <i>Acorn
	Structures, Inc. v. Swantz</i>, 846 F.2d 923, 926 (4th Cir. 1988);
	<i>Trenton v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp.</i>, 865 F. Supp. 1416, 1429
	(C.D. Cal. 1994). Plaintiff argues that the contractual restriction
	imposed in its user agreement established an "extra element" that
	makes its breach of contract claim different from its copyright
	infringement claim but, in reality, its breach of contract claim is
	nothing more than an effort to prevent defendants from copying and
	distributing its data, exactly what it sought to bar defendants from
	doing under copyright law. See <i>Ehat</i>, 780 F.2d at 878. The
	"extra element" test used to determine whether a state law right is
	equivalent to a right protected by copyright law requires more than
	the mere existence of an extra element in the state law claim. It
	requires an extra element that makes the state law claim qualitatively
	different from the underlying copyright claim. See <i>Data General
	Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp.</i>, 36 F.3d 1147, 1164 (1st
	Car. 1994) ("Not every 'extra element' of a state claim will establish
	a qualitative variance between the rights protected by federal
	copyright law and those protected by state law"); <i>Harper &amp; Row
	Publishers</i>, 723 F.2d at 201 (additional elements did not establish
	a fundamental nonequivalence between state and federal rights
	implicated); Rice, <i>supra</i>, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev. at 616 (Section 301
	concerned with effects, not form).

	<P>
	   Each of the breach of contract cases plaintiff cites involved the
	assertion of rights significantly different from the reproduction and
	distribution rights protected under copyright law. In <i>National Car
	Rental</i>, 991 F.2d 426, the plaintiff licensed the defendant to use
	its software for internal operations and for the processing of the
	defendant's data. When the defendant used the software to process the
	data of a third party, the plaintiff sued, contending that the
	defendant used the software in a manner outside the bounds of the
	contract. <i>Id.</i>  at 428. The court found that the agreement created a
	right that did not exist under copyright law, an "extra element" that
	made the breach of contract claim qualitatively different from a
	copyright infringement claim. <i>Id.</i> at 433. The plaintiff did not claim
	that the defendant had improperly reproduced, distributed or displayed
	the software, all of which would be claims that would have to brought
	under federal copyright law. <i>Taquino</i>, 893 F.2d 1488, and
	<i>Trenton</i>, 865 F. Supp. 1416, contain reasoning similar to that
	in <i>National Car Rental</i>. In <i>Taquino</i>, the court held that
	the provisions in a covenant not to compete were valid and that the
	rights the plaintiff sought to protect by enforcing the contract were
	sufficiently distinct from reproduction and distribution rights as not
	to be preempted by the federal Copyright Act. 893 F.2d at 1501. In
	<i>Trenton</i>, the court found a breach of contract claim not
	preempted by federal copyright law because "the contract-based causes
	of action do allege more than the unauthorized use of a copyrighted
	work. They also claim that there has been a breach of an underlying
	contract. . ." <i>Trenton</i>, 865 F.  Supp. at 1429. The court did
	not elaborate further on its reasoning. In <i>Acorn</i>, 846 F.2d 923,
	a Suit brought by an architect against a prospective customer who used
	the architect's plans to build his house without fulfilling his
	obligation to pay for them, the court viewed the architect's contract
	claim as a separate and distinct cause of action that did not arise
	out of the subject matter of copyright. <i>Id.</i> at 926.

	<P>
	   To the extent that <i>National Car Rental, Taquino, Trenton</i> and
	<i>Acorn</i> support the proposition that a copyright infringement
	claim is not equivalent to a contract claim merely because the
	contract claim requires a plaintiff to show the additional element of
	breach, I disagree respectfully with their conclusions. Contracts that
	seek to protect reproduction and distribution rights step into
	territory already covered by copyright law. It would alter the
	"delicate balance" of copyright law to allow parties to avoid
	copyright law by contracting around it.

	<P>
	   <i>National Car Rental, Taquino, Trenton,</i> and <i>Acorn</i> do
	show that contract claims are not preempted automatically by federal
	copyright law. Contracts that are consistent with the copyright law's
	goals of self-protection should be upheld.  Rightful owners should be
	able to define the limits of permissible copying or modification of
	their works. Thomas Lee Hazen, <i>Contract Principles as a Guide for
	Protecting Intellectual Property Rights in Computer Software: The
	Limits of Copyright Protection, the Evolving Concept of Derivative
	Works, and the Proper Limits of Licensing Arrangements</i>, 20
	U.C. Davis. L. Rev. 105, 142 (1986). It is only when a contract erects
	a barrier on access to information that under copyright law should be
	accessible that &#167; 301 Operates to protect copyright law from
	individually crafted evasions of that law. See Rice, <i>supra</i>, 53 U.
	Pitt. L. Rev. at 614 ("The far-reaching public policy Section 301
	implements clearly requires preemption of contract-based protection of
	expression as expression where the effect is to secure rights in that
	expression which are greater than, equal to, or supplemental of those
	which Section 106 secures); Hazen, <i>supra</i>, 20 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 129
	("Courts should invalidate contracts attempting to expand the
	intellectual property's protection too far beyond the parameters of
	copyright law on the grounds of statutory preemption, or as against
	public policy"); Christopher Celentino et al., <i>Vault Corp. v. Quaid
	Software Ltd.: Invalidating Shrink-Wrap Licenses?</i>, 2 J.L. &amp;
	Tech. 151, 162 (1987) (<i>Vault</i> opinion has merit if it means that
	contracts providing rights greater than or equivalent to those under
	copyright law are preempted).

	<P>
	   Plaintiff's license agreement is an attempt to avoid the confines
	of copyright law and of <i>Feist</i>, 499 U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358,
	111 S. Ct. 1282.  Its prohibition on the distribution of public
	information cannot be squared with the purposes of copyright law or
	with plaintiff's own compilation of data.  Had each of the compilers
	of the 3,000 directories that plaintiff used to put together its
	database attached a set of terms prohibiting further distribution of
	the information included in its directories, plaintiff would not have
	been able to create Select Phone TM without negotiating with and
	compensating each compiler for use of its data. The Supreme Court's
	decision in <i>Feist</i> allowed plaintiff to avoid these problems and
	create its database without any fear of copyright infringement. It is
	ironic that after plaintiff has attained the benefits of copyright
	law, it wants to prevent others from receiving that same
	protection. Unfortunately for plaintiff, the rules of the game have
	not changed. Just as plaintiff had public access to the telephone
	listings, so do defendants. Plaintiff cannot use a standard form
	contract to make an end run around copyright law. Its contract claim
	is preempted by &#167; 301.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>b. Misappropriation claim</h4>

	<P>
	   I note first that plaintfff set forth an unfair competition claim
	in its complaint but did not develop the claim in its summary judgment
	briefs. Because of the close relationship between the torts of unfair
	competition and misappropriation, I will treat plaintiff's unfair
	competition claim as part and parcel of its misappropriation claim.

	<P>
	   At an early stage, the House of Representatives bill that
	eventually became &#167; 301 included misappropriation in a list of
	torts that were considered not equivalent to copyright
	infringement. <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 676-77 n.25. That
	list was deleted from the bill shortly before passage. As enacted, 301
	of the Copyright Act does not provide any explicit guidance on the
	preemption of misappropriation claims by copyright law. Plaintiff
	cites extensive language from the House Report detailing why
	misappropriation is not necessarily synonymous with copyright
	infringement:

	<blockquote>
	   ". . . [A] cause of action labeled as 'misappropriation' is not
	preempted if it is in fact based neither on a right within the general
	scope of copyright as specified by Section 106 nor on a right
	equivalent thereto. For example, state law should have the flexibility
	to afford a remedy (under traditional principles of equity) against a
	consistent pattern of unauthorized appropriation by a competitor of
	the facts (i.e., not the literary expression) constituting 'hot' news,
	whether in the traditional mold of International News
	Serv. v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215, 63 L. Ed. 211, 39 S. Ct. 68
	(1918), or in the newer form of updates from scientific, business or
	other financial databases.  Likewise, a person having no trust or
	other relationship with the proprietor of a computerized database
	should not be immunized from sanctions against electronically or
	cryptographically breaching the proprietor's security arrangements and
	accessing the proprietor's data . . ."</blockquote>
	 
	H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5748. I hesitate to place too
	much weight on these statements because the Court of Appeals for the
	Seventh Circuit has determined that the deletion of the list from the
	bill should be given little weight in determining whether a particular
	right is equivalent to copyright, stating, "almost any interpretation
	of the concept of equivalent rights can be inferred from the
	legislative history." <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 676-77
	n.25; see also Nimmer, <i>supra</i>, &#167; 1.01[B] at 1-30 (in view of
	ambiguous legislative history, it is best to ignore the significance
	of the earlier explicit mention and later deletion of the word
	"misappropriation").  In addition, the discussion of misappropriation
	in the House Report seems to run counter to the discussion elsewhere
	in the report that "in the clearest and most unequivocal language
	possible. . ." &#167; 301 is intended to "avoid the development of any
	vague borderline areas between State and Federal Protection."
	H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5746.

	<P>
	   The majority of federal courts addressing this issue have found
	misappropriation claims preempted. See Nimmer, <i>supra</i>, &#167; 1.01[B]
	at 1-35 n. 156 ("misappropriation is but another label for
	reproduction and as such, is a preempted right 'within the general
	scope of copyright' under Section 301(a)") (collecting approximately
	twenty appellate and district court cases holding misappropriation
	claims preempted); <i>Universal City Studios v. T-Shirt Gallery,
	Ltd.</i>, 634 F. Supp. 1468, 1476 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (New York's
	misappropriation tort preempted); <i>Mayer v. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons,
	Ltd.</i>, 601 F. Supp. 1523, 1535 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (New York's
	misappropriation tort preempted); <i>Videotronics, Inc.  v. Bend
	Elecs.</i>, 564 F. Supp. 1471 (D. Nev. 1983) (where intellectual
	property subject to copyright law, applying state doctrine of
	misappropriation to protect it would create an unacceptable conflict
	with federal policy).

	<P>
	   Courts reaching the opposite conclusion have analyzed
	misappropriation claims different in nature from the one at hand and
	have looked more to the "extra element" that must be proven under the
	state law claims in finding that Congress did not intend to preempt
	the cause of action at issue. The cases plaintiff cites make this
	apparent. <i>Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp.</i>, 36
	F.3d 1147; <i>Princess Fabrics, Inc. v. CHF, Inc.</i>, 922 F.2d 99 (2d
	Cir. 1990); <i>Wilson v. Mr. Tee's</i>, 855 F. Supp. 679
	(D. N.J. 1994); <i>CSM Investors Inc. v.  Everest Development,
	Ltd.</i>, 840 F. Supp. 1304 (D. Minn. 1994); <i>Rubin v.  Brooks/Cole
	Pub. Co.</i>, 836 F. Supp. 909 (D. Mass. 1993). None of these cases
	involved a misappropriation claim based solely on improper copying and
	distribution. Rather, the cases involved trade secrets claims
	requiring plaintiff to show a breach of confidentiality, <i>Data
	General</i>, 36 F.3d at 1165, or "palming off" claims necessitating a
	showing that the public is misled about the origin of the
	product. <i>Princess Fabrics</i>, 922 F.2d at 104 (misappropriation
	claim is preempted but states may still prohibit palming off); <i>Wilson</i>,
	855 F. Supp. at 684 (palming off claims not preempted); <i>CSM
	Investors</i>, 840 F. Supp. at 1314 (neither unfair competition
	involving palming off nor unjust enrichment claims involving illegal
	benefit from another are preempted); <i>Rubin</i>, 836 F.  Supp. at
	924 (extra elements of misrepresentation and deceit qualitatively
	different from reproduction).

	<P>
	   The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has not addressed the
	preemption issue as it relates to misappropriation claims, although it
	affirmed a district court holding to that effect. See <i>Nash v. CBS,
	Inc.</i>, 899 F.2d 1537 (7th Cir.  1990), <i>aff'g on other grounds</i> 704
	F. Supp. 823, 835 (N.D. Ill. 1989). In <i>Nash</i>, 704 F. Supp. at
	834, the district court noted that, "The goal underlying copyright law
	is the same as that driving the tort of misappropriation: balancing
	the need to provide economic incentives for authorship against the
	preservation of the freedom to imitate." However, the district court
	did not go so far as to hold that &#167; 301 always preempts the tort
	of misappropriation. It found that the statements in the House
	Judiciary Committee Report on the 1976 Amendments to the Copyright Act
	reflected a legislative intent to keep available certain
	misappropriation claims. <i>Id.</i>

	<p> The elements of the tort of misappropriation in Wisconsin are "(1)
	time, labor and money expended in the creation of the thing
	misappropriated; (2) competition; and (3) commercial damage to the
	plaintiff." <i>Mercury Record Productions, Inc., v. Economic
	Consultants, Inc.</i>, 64 Wis. 2d 163, 174, 218 N.W.2d 705, 709
	(1974), <i>cert. denied</i>, 420 U.S. 914, 43 L. Ed. 2d 386, 95 S. Ct.  1107
	(1975). At first blush, the second and third factors of the Mercury
	Record test appear to constitute extra elements that would exempt
	Wisconsin's misappropriation tort from preemption. However, as
	discussed above, the mere presence of extra elements does not indicate
	that the underlying right is not equivalent to rights protected under
	&#167; 106 of the Copyright Act. When the purposes of copyright and
	misappropriation law are compared with respect to plaintiff's claim,
	it is evident that misappropriation does not serve any qualitatively
	different purposes from copyright law. Copyright law seeks to
	encourage individuals to create new works by offering them the
	security that those works will be rewarded with a limited
	monopoly. <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 678.  Thus it protects
	authors from those who seek to usurp the copyright owner's creative
	efforts by copying. The tort of misappropriation offers the same type
	of protection. Adding competition and commercial damage does not
	differentiate the underlying protected right. In fact, these elements
	are subsumed in a party's decision to bring a copyright infringement
	claim.  Without some form of competition and commercial damage, a
	party would not have the financial incentive to sue for copyright
	infringement. I conclude that because plaintiff's misappropriation
	claim is not qualitatively different from a copyright infringement
	claim, the underlying rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate are
	equivalent to federal rights and are preempted by the Copyright Act.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>c. Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act claim</h4>

	<P>
	   The Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act makes it unlawful to modify,
	destroy, access, take, or copy computer data willfully, knowingly and
	without authorization. Wis. Stat. &#167; 943.70(2)(a). Under the
	statute, "data" are property and include representations of
	information, knowledge or facts prepared in formalized manners and
	intended to be processed in a computer system. Wis. Stat &#167;
	943.70(1)(f).  Under the act, the Select Phone TM telephone listings
	qualify as data and defendants' distribution of that data is made
	unlawful.

	<P>
	   Again, the question is whether federal copyright law preempts the
	statute as it applies to defendants' actions. Plaintiff points to a
	recent Wisconsin appellate court decision in which the court held that
	the law was not preempted by the Copyright Act. In <i>State
	v. Corcoran</i>, 186 Wis. 2d 616, 522 N.W.2d 226 (Ct.  App.), 
	<i>review denied</i>,
	527 N.W.2d 335 (1994), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld a
	conviction under the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act of a computer
	software programmer who destroyed data stored on the computer of his
	former employer by inserting "booby traps into programs he had written
	for the employer. <i>Id.</i> at 620, 522 N.W.2d at 228. The court explained
	that it did not need to consider the defendant's argument that federal
	copyright law preempted the Wisconsin act because the data the
	defendant was accused of destroying could not be protected by
	copyright. <i>Id.</i> at 628, 522 N.W.2d at 231 ("Therefore, we need not
	decide if the federal Copyrights [<i>sic</i>] Act preempts the enforcement of
	the WCCA; Corcoran was properly convicted of destroying facts that
	cannot be protected by copyright"). The court said that "If [it] were
	to address the question of. . .preemption," it would apply the "extra
	element" test. <i>Id.</i> at 628 n.11, 522 N.W.2d at 231 n11.
	<P>
	   Plaintiff argues that the court reached its holding in
	<i>Corcoran</i> because the destroyed data were not copyrightable and
	therefore did not meet the first requirement of the preemption test,
	that the material fall within the subject matter of copyright. This is
	a reasonable interpretation of the court's holding, but not the only
	one. The court of appeals did not hold explicitly that such data does
	not "fall within the subject matter of copyright["] for purposes of
	preemption analysis. In fact, the court's footnote seems to indicate
	that the court's understanding of the preemption test focused solely
	on the second, or "extra element prong["] of the analysis. See 186
	Wis. 2d at 628 n.11, 522 N.W.2d at 231 n.11 ("The analysis applied by
	the federal courts requires a determination if the state-created cause
	of action contains an 'extra element' in addition to the acts of
	reproduction or distribution"). The court's discussion of the issue
	lacks specific mention of the subject matter test. As seen in
	<i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d 663, an inquiry into the subject
	matter of copyright requires more than just determining whether given
	material is a proper recipient of copyright protection. It is unlikely
	that the court's single sentence mention of subject matter in Corcoran
	was meant to foreclose future application of a more comprehensive
	subject matter test.

	<P>
	   Applying the preemption test to plaintiff's claim that defendants
	violated the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act, it becomes evident that
	the claim should be preempted for the same reasons as plaintiff's
	breach of contract and misappropriation claims. The first prong is
	satisfied because the telephone listings fall within the subject
	matter of copyright and the second is met because plaintiff seeks
	merely to prohibit the copying and distribution that it could not
	prevent under federal copyright law. In reaching this conclusion that
	federal law preempts plaintiff's claim under the Wisconsin Computer
	Crimes Act, I do not hold or intend to imply that the Wisconsin
	Computer Crimes Act is preempted in all instances. Preemption would
	not occur in a Corcoran-like situation when an individual destroys
	another's data purposefully. In those situations, the right sought to
	be enforced differs greatly from the copying and distribution rights
	covered by copyright law. What this conclusion does mean is that
	plaintiff cannot succeed on its underlying copyright claim by dressing
	it in other clothing. Plaintiff's efforts to establish a right under
	the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act conflicts directly with the federal
	copyright law's directive to keep unoriginal factual compilations in
	the public domain. It would undermine the public access to facts and
	ideas if states could block such access with their own legislation.
