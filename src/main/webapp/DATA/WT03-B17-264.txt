<PRE><STRONG><H2>Shopping for Rock Dust</H2></STRONG>
     Some things to look for in a good quality rock dust: You'll want a
very  fine dust, approx. 200 mesh. This is important because the  finer
the  dust  the  more  rapidly it is available to  the  plants  and  the
microbes which have to eat it. The location where it is mined is important
as this gives us a clue as to the forces that went into making it.  High
energy  always makes high energy. Ask for a lab report. What PH is  it?
Don't  use cement for construction use. Tell them what you want  to  do
with it. Don't use any rock dust that has any type of chemical added to
it.
<STRONG><H2>The Test</H2></STRONG>
     A  good  test is to fill a clear glass half full with your  sample
and  cover  it  with 3 inches of water. Shake it up  and  allow  it  to
settle.  The  dust,  silt  and sand will settle  into  three  different
layers,  with  the  dust  settling on  top.  This  will  give  you  the
percentage of how much of each you have. The finer the grind the easier
the  bacteria can get at it. However I have also found it  to  be  true
that  small  chunks, less than 1/4 inch, are good for the soil  as  other
creatures  will  eat it also. Another thing is that these  chunks  will
break apart later providing additional food.
<STRONG><H2>Another Test</H2></STRONG>
     Take any magnet and place on rock dust.  If it clings to the magnet
it is of the right energy polarity.
<STRONG><H2>Making Rock Dust Milk</H2></STRONG>
     Slowly  add  water  to  a  cup of rock  dust.  Stir  slowly  until
dissolved.  Add  to  1  gallon water, allow to sit,  then  strain  into
sprayer. This makes the food instantly available to plants sprayed.
<STRONG><H2>Types of Rock Dust</H2></STRONG>
     Rado  Rock comes from Canada straight from the glaciers.  Planters
II  comes  from the Colorado Rockies. Earth Wealth comes from  the  San
Gabriel Mountains in southern California. Azomite comes from Utah. Rock
Phosphate is a well known rock dust, excellent when finely ground.  New
Jersey Greensand is also a very nice rock dust but can be expensive  to
buy depending on where you live in the USA.

<STRONG><H2>Some Sources of Rock Dust</H2></STRONG>
     Contact  your  local state farming organization or  local  organic
grower for local sources of rock dust.
