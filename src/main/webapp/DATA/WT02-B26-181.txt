<H2>Welcome to the Center for Transportation Research</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Mission</B>
<P>
The Center for Transportation Research (CTR) evaluates the effects of federal transportation policies and examines the prospects for new transportation technologies.  Economic modeling and engineering are the foundation of the Center's work.  The Center plays a prominent role in the national laboratories' technical support for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.  Other current projects include the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Testing the feasibility of alternative-fueled vehicles (ethanol, methanol, and natural gas),</LI>
<LI>Investigating the potential for oxygen enrichment for both diesel and spark-ignition engines,</LI>
<LI>Conducting experiments on novel methods for controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx),</LI>
<LI>Developing engineering research competitions for university students to build hybrid-electric vehicles,</LI>
<LI>Conducting assessments of lightweight materials in automobiles, and</LI>
<LI>Evaluating the energy and environmental implications of a renewable oxygenate standard for reformulated gasoline. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
The Center is organized into three sections:  
<UL>
<LI>Technology Engineering
<LI>Environmental and Economic Assessments
<LI>Advanced Systems.
</UL>
The Socio-Economic Research Program is also featured in this summary. 
<P>
<P>
<B>BACKGROUND AND MISSION</B>
<P>
The transportation research program operates with a well-defined mission:  to provide the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and others with an independent evaluation of the impacts of technological change in the transportation sector and, where appropriate, provide research and development to overcome technical obstacles.  The transportation research staff conducts fuels and engine research; economic and environmental assessments, for instance, of lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium, and composites; and analyses and experimental research on advanced transportation concepts (such as magnetic levitation).  
<P>
The Center for Transportation Research has extensive experience in analyzing both passenger and freight transportation systems and the impacts of new technologies and changes in government policies.  To aid in this analysis, Center staff have developed computer models, with extensive peer review, to project transportation energy use and pollutant emissions for all transport modes.
<P>
Transportation energy use is particularly important for the following reasons:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Transportation is almost entirely dependent on oil,
<LI>Almost two-thirds of all oil is used for transportation, and
<LI>Petroleum use in the transportation sector alone now exceeds domestic oil production.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Exploring new ways to improve transportation energy efficiency is not only beneficial because of the dwindling supply of U.S. oil resources and the balance-of-payments effects of imported oil, but is always critical when world oil supplies are unexpectedly interrupted.  
<P>
The staff consists of researchers in such fields as mechanical and chemical engineering, physics, environmental sciences, geography, and economics.  Augmenting the regular staff are special term appointees (from universities and the private sector) who work on an as-needed basis, as well as staff from other sections/teams in the Energy Systems Division and other divisions at Argonne.  In addition, when the research project's objective is to ensure technology development capability within industry, the Center will contract a substantial portion of the research to the private sector.<BR>
