&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What makes a great expedition itinerary?  This is a question which we are constantly asking ourselves as we prepare our future Travel Calendar.  When we introduce a new expedition in our newsletter, we wait eagerly to get the first response from clients.  If the phones are ringing and available space on the departure is rapidly shrinking we know that we have a winner.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was certainly the case with our 1996 Across the Top of Australia and Australia’s Kimberley expeditions.  While we have always been fascinated with this area - about which so little is known - we knew our hunch was right when Australian travel agents began to call us in order to book their clients on this expedition!<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another indication that our Australia expeditions were truly compelling was the reaction of the crew and officers of the Coral Princess.  This 42-passenger vessel normally travels along the Great Barrier Reef, and I think the crew were almost as excited as the passengers to have the opportunity to see this little-visited part of their country.  The captain and officers even used their seniority status to be assigned to our charters!  The owner of the vessel was aboard for one voyage and, upon disembarking, thanked expedition leaders Mike and Sonja for showing him his own country!<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While we thrive on the encouraging enthusiasm of both ship staff and clients, there is also a lot of behind-the-scenes preparation that goes into developing a new expedition destination.  As a result of our research and scouting, we decided to build a specially designed excursion boat, the ZOE Explorer, whose shallow draft and powerful engines allow safe exploration along the shoreline and up the shallow rivers of northwestern Australia’s convoluted coast.  In addition, we developed plans to charter helicopters for flightseeing excursions in order to give passengers an idea of the interior of the country, as well as to ferry them to scenic Mitchell Falls and other areas of interest not accessible from the shore.  We hired a jet boat for a day to allow an excursion up the mighty Ord River, and chartered small planes to fly over Lake Argyle and the Bungle Bungles, two extraordinary regions not to be missed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that our first Australian season is over, we can report that it was a great success!  Lots of happy people disembarked at the end of each voyage, and we have heard many enthusiastic comments from both staff and clients.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the interest of "spreading the word" about Australia’s northwestern coast, we have allotted a generous amount of space in this newsletter to the topic.  You can find below several interesting items of Aussie "Trivia," and inside is Lisa King’s article about her experiences in the land of "Aus". Finally, turn to the back of the Response Card in this issue to read some of what passengers had to say! <BR>
