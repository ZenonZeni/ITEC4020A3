<strong>Clampdown in Addis<br>
Ethiopia's Journalists at Risk</strong><br>
<br>
by Kakuna Kerina<br>
<br>
After centuries of feudal rule, 17 years of communist dictatorship, almost<br>
three decades of civil war, and no tradition of an independent press before 1992, Ethiopia is<br>
at a crossroads. <br>
<br>
As one of the African continent's youngest exercises in democracy, Ethiopia can serve as an </dt>
<dt>example of a true democracy--one that does not sacrifice freedom of expression and human </dt>
<dt>rights as its leaders establish order. Or, it can join the ranks of neighbors whose leaders</dt>
<dt>assumed office promising respect for press freedom and other civil rights, but who have </dt>
</dl>
<dt>since broken these and other pledges.<br>
<br>
As things stand today, Ethiopia's independent journalists and the government of Meles Zenawi, </dt>
<dt>the country's first freely elected prime minister, eye each other with mutual suspicion and </dt>
<dt>distrust. Journalists labor under a restrictive press law and penal code, and, as a result, more </dt>
<dt>journalists have been jailed in Ethiopia in the past three years than in any other African country. </dt>
<dt>The Committee to Protect Journalists embarked on a fact-finding mission to Ethiopia in May </dt>
<dt>1996 to better understand how and why the press law and other legal measures are used </dt>
<dt>against journalists.</dt>
<dl>
<dt><br>
Following the fall of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam's communist regime in 1991 and encouraged </dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>by assurances of press freedom by the newly installed Transitional Government of Ethiopia </dt>
<dt>(TGE), a vociferous independent media exploded into existence, signaling what many hoped </dt>
<dt>would be the end of tight government control over information. <br>
<br>
One of the first acts of the TGE, led by then-President Meles*, was passage of the Press </dt>
<dt>Proclamation No. 34/1992 in October 1992. The law quickly put an end to the euphoria </dt>
<dt>that fueled the country's new era of free speech as journalists realized how vulnerable they</dt>
<dt>were under the proclamation, which is both restrictive and contradictory. The legislation </dt>
<dt>prohibits, among other things, the dissemination of information the government deems </dt>
<dt>dangerous, and requires the licensing of all journalists. Moreover, it classifies libel as both a </dt>
<dt>criminal and civil offense, demanding penalties of payment in the amount of twice the value of<br>
a publisher's assets.<br>
<br>
Criminal libel laws or indeed any statutes intended or used to insulate government officials<br>
from press criticism through the application of civil or criminal penalties have no place in<br>
democratic societies. The right to speak freely without fear of government<br>
reprisal is a core principle of democracy, and critical reporting must be tolerated and<br>
protected, not criminalized.<br>
<br>
In late 1993, reeling from criticism from a growing number of newspapers and magazines </dt>
<dt>about state policies and the political transition under way, the government cracked down on </dt>
<dt>the press, starting with the detention of Tefera Asmare, editor of the independent newspaper </dt>
<dt>Etiopis. In connection with an article titled &quot;There's War in Gondar,&quot; Tefera was charged </dt>
<dt>with &quot;inciting people against the government&quot; and &quot;disseminating false rumors,&quot; under Article </dt>
<dt>10, Section 2 of the Press Proclamation. Tefera was later charged with 11 counts of libel</dt>
<dt>under the press law; five counts were for the same story carried in different editions of </dt>
<dt>Etiopis. In March 1994, he was convicted of all charges and sentenced to a two-year prison </dt>
<dt>term. He was released on Sept. 27, 1995.<br>
<br>
The irony of Tefera's arrest was that he was legally carrying out his responsibilities as a </dt>
<dt>journalist according to the Press Proclamation's Art. 4, Sec. 2, which states that &quot;the press</dt>
<dt>gathers and disseminates news; expresses opinions on various issues; forwards criticisms on </dt>
<dt>various issues; participates in forming public opinion by employing various other methods;</dt>
<dt>[and] undertakes other activities necessary for the accomplishment of its purposes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tefera's case is emblematic of the double bind imposed on independent Ethiopian<br>
journalists--he is one of more than 50 who have been imprisoned for their work since 1993.</dt>
<dt>By simultaneously using ambiguous articles of the Press Proclamation and provisions of the </dt>
<dt>civil, penal, and criminal codes, many of which were created in the 1950s, the Meles </dt>
<dt>government has put the media on notice that it will not hesitate to manipulate the laws to </dt>
<dt>suit its own ends.<br>
<br>
Ethiopia, which is a signatory to several regional and international charters guaranteeing press</dt>
<dt>freedom, such as the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and the International </dt>
<dt>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has rapidly become a country where reality </dt>
<dt>belies the government's public proclamations about the need for a free press. Contradictory</dt>
<dt>statements by government officials illuminate this gap between rhetoric and policy. &quot;A free </dt>
<dt>press is an essential ingredient of any democratic exercise [because it provides] information </dt>
<dt>to the public so they can make informed decisions,&quot; Prime Minister Meles told CPJ's mission. </dt>
<dt>During the same meeting, however, he also said that the government has to impose restrictions </dt>
<dt>on the media to stave off ethnic strife and threats to national security. <br>
<br>
The stance that Prime Minister Meles' administration chooses to adopt toward the<br>
independent press in the coming years will have significant repercussions.<br>
The existence of a free press in Ethiopia is dependent upon a clear commitment from the<br>
government to support the development of private media and to lift restrictions on reporting </dt>
<dt>and private-sector competition. Ethiopia cannot claim to be a genuine democracy, nor should </dt>
<dt>it be treated as one by Western donors such as the United States, unless the Meles government<br>
ceases its practice of subjecting independent journalists to repeated arrests, detention without </dt>
<dt>trial, and excessive fines.<br>
