<p><strong>Balance-of-System Components</strong>
<P>
In addition to PV cells and modules, all PV systems must have other components that help to convert, deliver, and store electricity. Today, <a href="balance.html">balance-of-system (BOS)</a> components represent about half the cost of a PV system, but they are responsible for 99% of system repair problems. Another problem is that about 15% of the electricity generated by PV modules is lost during conversion and transmission through BOS components. 
<P>
BOS components include charge controllers, batteries, control systems, mounting hardware, tracking systems, wiring, and power-conditioning hardware such as inverters. Failures of inverters, which convert the direct current (dc) from PV modules to alternating current (ac), are the number-one cause of PV system problems. Recent tests at Sandia's Power Processing Laboratory have shown that most of today's inverters exceed accepted levels of acoustic noise and radio-frequency interference (RFI). Cooperative R&D contracts support the development of quieter, more reliable inverters that can be mass-produced for the PV industry. We also plan to test and improve trackers, control units, charge controllers, and batteries.

<BR CLEAR=all>
Through this work, we expect to bring down the cost of BOS components and improve their performance. Many of today's systems are one-of-a-kind; they incur very high costs for design and installation, which should be reduced when the systems are mass-produced. Also, few designs for mechanical or electronic BOS components have been optimized for PV systems. So, their cost and performance should improve as system designs improve. Rapid advances in power electronics for a variety of applications will also improve the performance and reduce the cost of entire PV systems. 
<P>
Our goals are to keep the cost of BOS components to less than 50% of the total PV system cost, improve their reliability, and increase their efficiency. For inverters, we intend to increase their efficiency to 98% and the mean time between failures to at least 5 years.  ("Mean time between failures" refers to the average amount of time that passes between equipment failures.)
