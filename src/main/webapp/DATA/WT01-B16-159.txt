Obesity</FONT></FONT>
<P>We at Kind Care Medical Center believe that obesity is often a result
of chronic reactive hypoglycemia. A cycle develops when someone consumes
foods that are high in sugar or carbohydrates that metabolize rapidly to
sugar. This concentrated sugar stimulates the pancreas to release insulin
into the blood. Insulin causes the sugar to be removed from the blood. Often
an excessive amount of insulin is released and this causes low blood sugar.
The brain needs a constant supply of sugar to function. When it senses blood
sugars are dropping certain symptoms develop. These symptoms include severe
hunger and craving sweets. The individual then over eats and eats foods that
provide quick sugar. This becomes an endless cycle that causes obesity. We
use medication and a hypoglycemic diet to reverse this pattern.
<P>
<P>Dr. Seale Harris first discovered hypoglycemia in 1924. He was an
Endocrinologist who noticed a similarity between his patients that took too
much insulin and some of his other patients. He published an artical in the
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
<P>
<P>Sugar and caffeine are prime causes of pancreatic overactivity and consequent
chronic low blood sugar. We are eating an abnormal diet. The average American
eats 1 teaspoon of sugar every 35 minutes, 24 hours a day. Ancient man did
not have concentrated starch or sugar. His body used small amounts with great
efficiency. It manufactured small amounts at a time from other types of food.
Modern man, programmed to use only a little starch or sugar with great
effeciency, is trying to cope with more than 250 pounds of highly concentrated
sugar, flour, and cereals a year.
<P>
<P>Another name for hypoglycemia is hyperinsulinism. The pancreas is over
responsive to sugar. Chronic over stimulation of the pancrease can cause
exhaustion and diabetes. The pancreas may also be fooled into responding
to the sweet taste of sugar substitutes. Proteins do not pull the insulin
trigger like sugar and starch do. The diet should be low in sugar and starch.
<P>
