<p><strong>Technology Development</strong>
<P>
To translate laboratory innovations into technical improvements for commercial products, our
researchers are investigating three areas: manufacturing technology, module development, and
<a href="balance.html">balance-of-system (BOS)</a> components. 
<P>
Manufacturing Technology
<P>
Through collaborations, we have worked with industry to reduce module production costs by as
much as 50% during the last 5 years, and hope to decrease them by another factor of 2 during the
next 5 years. We intend to achieve this goal by increasing throughput; by modifying laboratory
techniques for production; by assessing new manufacturing processes and finding better ways to
scale up manufacturing processes; by measuring, analyzing, and characterizing PV materials and
devices; and by simplifying PV systems and incorporating the most durable, cost-effective
components available. 
<P>
Most of this work is performed under the auspices of the PV Manufacturing Technology
(PVMaT) initiative.  It addresses manufacturing R&D for crystalline silicon, concentrators, and
various thin-film technologies.

Module Development
<P>
Through measurements, analysis, accelerated testing, and collaborative R&D, we intend to
produce better, stronger encapsulants and improve the performance, durability, and lifetime of
PV modules.

Balance-of-System Components
<P>
Although BOS components (such as inverters, batteries, support structures, junction boxes, and
control systems) represent just half the cost of PV systems, they are responsible for as much as
99% of system failure and repair problems. The goal here is to increase the efficiency of these
components, increase their reliability through optimized designs, and reduce their costs through
mass production.
