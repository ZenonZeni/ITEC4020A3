<P>In the last year we at Kind Care Medical Clinic have been seriously studying
the causes and medical treatment of obesity. We have treated over 1000 patients
so far using the phentermin and fenfluramine combination of medication. We
have used it ourselves. We closely observed our feelings and behaviors. We
intensly studied our patient's diets, feelings, and weight loss. Observations
lead us to search the medical liturature and even out-of-the-ordinary sources
to try and understand better this disease. Our think tank includes Karin
Healy RN, Ingrid Iwaszko RN, and myself.
<P>
<P>Gradually we made some discoveries that are contradictory to what we have
traditionally been taught about diet and weight loss. First we noticed that
our patients were complaining of feeling tired, dizzy, having headaches,
shaky, hungry, and craving sweets. At first we thought these were side effects
of the medication. But then it struck us that this sounds like hypoglycemia.
These are the effects of low blood sugar on the nervous system. We started
recommending that our patients eat more often. To eat six times per day instead
of three. This seemed to help the symptoms and lead us to do further research
on hypoglycemia.
<P>
<P>We are most familiar with hypoglycemia in diabetics that have taken too
much insulin or have not eaten at their regular time. We became interested
in the role of insulin in metabolism, especially in people suffering from
obesity. 
<P>
<P>We know that insulin is needed for us to use and store sugar for energy.
But insulin has some effects that are not desirable. It converts glucose
and protein to fat and converts fat we eat to stored fat in our body. It
increases the body's production of cholesterol. It makes the kidneys retain
more fluid. It thickens the walls of arteries.
<P>
<P>Too much insulin makes you gain weight. It makes your cholesterol and
your blood pressure rise. There is another hormone in the body that balances
insulin called glucagon. It raises blood sugar and causes some desirable
effects. It makes our body burn fat and decreases the body's production of
cholesterol. It makes the kidneys release excess water and opens the thickened
arterial walls.
<P>
<P>We have been told to eat low fat diets. That usually means you will be
eating a low protein diet also. This is because most protein comes from animals
and comes with fat. That leaves only carbohydrates for us to eat. But a high
carbohydrate diet stimulates the pancrease to release a large amount of insulin
and very little glucagon. Protein stimulates a only a modest amount of insulin
release and stimulates more glucagon release. Fat has very little effect
on insulin or glucagon.
<P>
<P>Gradually our cells become more and more resistant to insulin on a high
carbohydrate diet. The pancrease has to release more to have the same effect
on sugar levels. This results in a state of hyperinsulinemia.
<P>
<P>Hyperinsulinemia exagerates all the undesirable effects of &nbsp;insulin.
It leads to diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and high cholesterol. And these
diseases usually terminate in cardiovascular related deaths from stroke or
heart attack.
<P>
<P>Our search for a cure for obesity has lead us to a discovery that could
help reduce the other main chronic deseases of our time. This discovery is
that instead of eating a low fat, high carbohydrate diet, we should be eating
a high protein, low carbohydrate diet. The emphesis is on low carbohydrates.
The nutrition we need to sustain us should come mostly from protein. The
fat that is associated with most proteins is not a major problem.
<P>
<P>The concept we use now in our weight control program is to use the medications
phentermine and fenfluramine to remove cravings for carbohydrates. The medication
seems to make people more consious of what they eat. This gives us the
opportunity to reprogram a person's eating behavior. Now we have a better
idea of how the new program should be designed.
<P>
<P>Now protein is king and carbohydrates are the enemy. This is a simple
concept and very logical. It is however the opposite of what we are used
to hearing. This new paradigm, I believe, &nbsp;is a major step towards
preventing and reversing obesity and many of the other chronic diseases of
our time.
<P>
<P>We at Kind Care Medical Center will continue our research and seek to
steadily improve our treatments for obesity and other preventitive measures.
<P>
<P>Sincerely,
<P>
