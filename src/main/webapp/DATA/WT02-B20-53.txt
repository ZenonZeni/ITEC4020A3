There are many students with high native abilities that remain underdeveloped because of inadequate opportunity, practice, and motivation. Although genetics significantly affects development of various intelligences, environment (including cultural values) and sequential experiences help crystallize native abilities. Schools must organize and institutionalize equal opportunities and experiences for talented students, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic origin.(12 references) (MLH)<BR>

This report on gifted education is based on surveys returned by central education agencies in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The first section contains informational charts which provide a broad overview of state level services for gifted students. Included are data on the level of personnel support for the program, whether or not the state has a mandate and what the mandate requires, the number of students served by the program, and the level of financial support for these services. The second part of the report contains narrative information from state and trust territories on topics related to school reform. This section shows the impact that issues such as middle grade reform, site-based decisionmaking, and state education agency reorganization have had and are having on services to gifted students. Finally, the third section contains the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contact persons at state education agencies and state associations. (DB)<BR>

This report presents a model state legislative bill to provide for the special needs of gifted and talented students. The model bill utilizes a "best practices" framework and attempts to be fiscally responsible and provide maximum flexibility while meeting the needs of gifted and talented students.  The model legislation itself begins with a statement of purpose followed by a section defining the population of gifted and talented students and stating a policy of nondiscrimination. A section on supervision of gifted and talented programs covers the Office of State Coordinator, the duties of the Office of State Coordinator, and collaboration with the State Advisory Board. The section on the State Advisory Board for Gifted and Talented Education includes guidelines for Board establishment, Board membership, and Board duties.  Specific program responsibilities and criteria are presented in the section on gifted and talented programs. In addition, a definition and nondiscrimination policy statement are offered on the issue of traditionally underserved populations. The final section makes appropriation recommendations. Following the model legislation, analysis is provided for each of the Bill's sections.  (DB)<BR>

This paper, commissioned for the development of the national report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent," examines current state policies, regulations, and legislation concerning education programs for gifted and talented students. The paper also looks at other state policies which have a direct influence on the nature and scope of local programs for gifted and talented students. Recent policies to restructure education are considered in the context of their effects on programs for gifted and talented students. Specific principles are recommended for shaping the reform agenda in the areas of curriculum and instruction, accountability, and governance. For each principle, examples of actions and potential impact on gifted and talented students are discussed. In addition, approaches taken by states to the following traditional issues are considered: (1) whether gifted and talented education policies should be linked with special education policies; (2) how the state should define and demarcate the gifted and talented population; (3) whether the state should mandate services for gifted and talented students; and (4) how the state can provide fiscal incentives to districts for gifted and talented education programs. The paper concludes with a checklist for states in policy development and recommendations for federal leadership. (DB)<BR>

This study analyzed state policies on the identification and education of gifted students as reflected in legislation, regulations, rules, recommendations, and guidelines provided by 49 states. The elements examined include: (1) state mandated services, (2) district plans for the gifted, (3) gifted education as part of special education, (4) philosophy or rationale, (5) definitions of gifted and talented, (6) identification procedures, (7) programs for the gifted, (8) differentiated curriculum and instruction, (9) counseling and other support services, (10) parent involvement, (11) program evaluation, (12) teacher education and certification, and (13) state funding for the gifted. The analysis indicated that all states have formulated policies that support education of the gifted and talented but that considerable variability among states exists with respect to specific components. Major recommendations are made in the following areas: establishing challenging curriculum standards; providing high-level learning opportunities; ensuring access to early childhood education; offering extended opportunities for economically disadvantaged and minority children; providing teacher training and technical assistance; and matching the high performance of similar students throughout the world.
