<H2>Chemotherapy and the Gerson Patient</H2>
<H4>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson
Institute</H4>
<P>During the mid-fifties, just as <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> was demonstrating some of his most dramatic
results with a nutritional treatment for cancer, chemotherapy
started to be used by establishment medicine. The reason was
the general disillusion with the results of surgery and
radiation in the treatment of cancer patients. The
chemotherapeutic drugs were supposed to stop the fast
reproduction of tumor cells - and thus stop cancer.
Originally, these highly toxic agents were based on the
mustard gas of warfare of which there was a huge remaining
supply after the end of World War II. When these drugs soon
were found to be too toxic and at best only temporarily
effective, new combinations were compounded all supposedly
stopping or slowing the multiplication of fast growing
tissue. But since there are various tissues in the human body
which must multiply rapidly (bone marrow producing red and
white blood corpuscles which constitute a large part of the
immune system) other very serious side-effects were always
present with the chemotherapy treatments: damage to bone
marrow; poisoning of the liver and often destruction of the
kidneys, not to speak of damage also to the heart. </P>
<P>In spite of over 30 years of use of chemotherapy in the
treatment of cancer patients, and in spite of its status as a
'proven' cancer treatment, these drugs have never been
officially accepted nor do they have the full approval of
FDA. Chemotherapy is still an &quot;experimental&quot;
treatment, largely because it has never undergone 'double
blind' studies. Why not? </P>
<P>Chemotherapy was just being introduced toward the end of
<A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A>'s practice in New York, shortly before he
died. He talks about his experience with Johnny Gunther in
Appendix II of A Cancer Therapy Results of 50 Cases, p. 415.
(See also John Gunther's book, Death Be Not Proud) Johnny was
possibly the only patient <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> treated after he had been given chemotherapy.
The book describes the terrible response, the swollen arm,
the severe bone marrow depression and the doctor's
expectation that Johnny would quickly die. Nobody suspected
that <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> could reverse some of the damage. But <A
href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> could not have known what the Gerson doctors
in Mexico have discovered after years of working with cancer
patients who had previously been given chemotherapy, namely
that these heavy drugs are released back into the system and
cause the prior poisoning symptoms to show up once more. This
generally happens after some six months on the Gerson
Therapy. That was also Dr. Gerson's experience with Johnny
Gunther - but he did not know that it was due to the prior
chemotherapy treatment. He took the blame for Johnny's death,
assuming that the only cause was the treatment with hormones
which he had applied. </P>
<P>Oncologists using chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of
their cancer patients are told that the body, in time,
excretes these drugs, and that the damage is thus overcome.
It is true that many patients grow hair again after they have
lost it; that their blood count comes back up to near normal
and their mucous membranes heal after breaking down with
ulcers due to the chemotherapy treatments. They overcome the
terrible nausea and vomiting caused by the toxic drugs, the
weakness and depression, etc. (Of course if they suffer also
the loss of kidney function due to the chemotherapeutic
drugs, this does not reverse. The kidneys, once destroyed, do
not recover.) But overcoming the immediate toxicity does not
prove that all the toxic materials have left the body. On the
contrary, the Gerson doctors' experience with patients who
have had prior treatment with chemotherapy gives an entirely
different picture. </P>
<P>When the first Gerson Therapy treatment facility in
Mexico (La Gloria) was started in 1977, we went as closely as
possible by <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A>'s directions in his book, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy </A> . But since <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> didn't have any experience with chemotherapy
patients, his book contains no special directions regarding
such patients. No special adjustments were made by the Gerson
doctors for such patients. Our first serious shock came when,
at almost the same time, two patients with previous
chemotherapy treatments were admitted and started on the
Therapy. They received the full intensive treatment,
including the starting medications, five coffee enemas a day,
and the castor oil treatment every other day. As the bodies
of these two patients detoxified intensively, they had all
the symptoms of a chemotherapy overdose. Of course the Gerson
physicians had given none of these drugs. So the only
conclusion was that the drugs still remaining in the body
from treatments many months earlier, were being released
rapidly, in large amounts, poisoning these patients a second
time! They landed in intensive care, they were so ill. The
Gerson doctors were shocked into the realization that
chemotherapy patients could not be treated with the same
protocols as those who had received none of these toxic
drugs. It must also be understood that patients treated with
chemotherapeutic agents often had recurrences which caused
them to seek alternative therapies. </P>
<P>At one point, the results of the Gerson Therapy in
patients with previous chemotherapy treatments were so poor
that we refused to accept such patients. However, in time,
some patients begged to be allowed to come. Others, after
chemotherapy, felt that the Gerson Therapy was so logical and
basic that they tried the Gerson Therapy at home on their own
and, to our great surprise, succeeded! So, it became clear
that it could be done. </P>
<P>With this empirical evidence in hand, the Gerson Therapy
physicians began to treat patients who had received prior
chemotherapy. These patients were given less intensive
medications; they were given only two or three coffee enemas
daily instead of the regular five. They were not given castor
oil treatments, in order to avoid sudden and intensive
detoxification and they improved. It was now a question
whether this less intensive treatment would work fast enough
and well enough to stop the advance of the cancer, yet not so
fast as to cause an overdose of the chemotherapeutic
chemicals being pushed out of their systems. In many cases,
it worked. Admittedly, the results in cases where patients
had received prior chemotherapy were sharply reduced compared
to those who received no such toxic drugs. But, in many
cases, we were still able to obtain recoveries. </P>
<P>We did find out, however, that certain cancers do not
respond after chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer, which shows
excellent results on the Gerson Therapy, does not respond
after the patient had received chemotherapy. The same goes
for cancers that have extensively metastasized (spread) into
the liver. Leukemias, after heavy chemotherapy, are also
difficult to reverse with the Gerson Therapy. Brain tumors
fall into the same category. Melanomas, which usually respond
exceptionally well to the Gerson Therapy, do relatively
poorly after chemotherapy. All types of lymphomas do
relatively well on the Gerson Therapy despite chemotherapy;
the same goes for ovarian cancers. Of course, all types of
cancer respond much better with no prior toxic drug
treatments. </P>
<P>According to various sources, after the administration of
chemotherapy, the patient's body excretes somewhere between
35% and 50% of the drugs given. The problem for a researcher
is to prove this statement. Unfortunately, there are no true
tests for toxicity in the system. I personally feel that the
remaining toxic drugs could be lodged in the connective or
fatty tissues. They cannot possibly remain in the liver; this
essential organ would be poisoned beyond function. But all
drug tests are performed on serum or blood samples, not solid
tissues. Fluids do not show positive for these agents simply
because the drugs are not circulating, but are lodged in some
tissue. </P>
<P>The reason we feel so certain that poisons remain in the
body after chemotherapy treatments, even up to two years
later, is that we see the patients excreting them. In the
course of the Gerson Therapy, patients typically go through
healing crises, or &quot;Flare-Ups,&quot; described by <A
href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> in <A href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy </A> , pp. 201-203. During these flare-ups
we see that the patient's body excretes many accumulated
toxins. Often, these toxins are readily identifiable by their
odors. When patients who had prior chemo go through these
detoxifying 'flare-up' days, they experience the same
symptoms they originally felt while they were receiving the
chemotherapeutic agents: they feel nauseous, taste the
chemicals, smell the drugs in their stool, have some loss of
hair, mouth ulcers, and temporarily depressed red and white
blood cell counts. Since we have learned to treat and
detoxify these patients cautiously, we find that the heavy
chemotherapy drug releases can happen at about six months
into the Gerson Therapy. At that time the patient either
recovers or goes into decline. </P>
<P>Since our experience with patients who have had prior
chemotherapy is always questionable, we have often refused to
admit patients who had received a &quot;bone marrow
transplant.&quot; These patients are treated extremely
heavily with chemotherapeutic chemicals, after their bone
marrow is removed. The marrow is then returned, on the theory
that since it has remained free of the toxic drugs, it will
continue to function. In fact, that does not happen, since
the drugs continue to circulate in the body and, of course,
soon contaminate the 'clean' bone marrow. </P>
<P>One patient, suffering from ovarian cancer, and showing
poor results after several courses of chemotherapy, was given
a bone marrow transplant at a cost upward of $150,000.00.
This treatment did not control her cancer, which continued to
spread. She then called us and wished to be admitted to the
<A href="center.html">
hospital </A> for the Gerson Therapy. However, while she
admitted to being heavily treated with chemotherapy, she did
not tell the Gerson physicians about receiving a bone marrow
transplant. So, with a warning that chemotherapy patients do
not respond as well as those who have not been pretreated,
she was accepted for the Gerson Therapy. She was given the
less intensive therapy, developed specifically for patients
who have had prior chemotherapy, and responded quite well.
Her symptoms and blood counts improved. However, as expected,
after six months from the start of the Gerson Therapy, she
went into a heavy 'healing reaction'. In her case, this
consisted of abscesses breaking out all over her body. These
boils released pus, and, of course, she was very
uncomfortable during a few weeks. Nevertheless, she worked
through it - and after it was over, was much better. We have
to assume that, in her case, much of the heavy poisoning was
excreted through the skin. </P>
<P>There are more and more reports by establishment
oncologists doubting the value of chemotherapy, even to the
point of rejecting it outright. One of these, cancer
biostatistician Dr. Ulrich Abel, of Heidelberg, Germany,
issued a monograph titled Chemotherapy of Advanced Epithelial
Cancer in 1990. (See Healing Journal, No. 1-2, Vol.7 of the
Gerson Institute.) Epithelial cancers comprise the most
common forms of adenocarcinoma: lung, breast, prostate,
colon, etc. After ten years as a statistician in clinical
oncology, Abel became increasingly uneasy. &quot;A sober and
unprejudiced analysis of the literature,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;has rarely revealed any therapeutic success by the
regimens in question in treating advanced epithelial
cancer.&quot; While chemotherapy is being used more and more
extensively, more than a million people die worldwide of
these cancers annually - and a majority have received some
form of chemotherapy before dying. Abel further concluded,
after polling hundreds of cancer doctors, &quot;The personal
view of many oncologists seems to be in striking contrast to
communications intended for the public.&quot; Abel cited
studies that have shown &quot;that many oncologists would not
take chemotherapy themselves if they had cancer.&quot; (The
Cancer Chronicles, December, 1990.) &quot;Even though toxic
drugs often do effect a response, a partial or complete
shrinkage of the tumor, this reduction does not prolong
expected survival,&quot; Abel finds. &quot;Sometimes, in
fact, the cancer returns more aggressively than before, since
the chemo fosters the growth of resistant cell lines.&quot;
Besides, the chemo has severely damaged the body's own
defenses, the immune system and often the kidneys as well as
the liver. </P>
<P>In an especially dramatic table, Dr. Abel displays the
results of chemotherapy in patients with various types of
cancers, as the improvement of survival rates, compared to
untreated patients. </P>
<P>This table shows:</P>
<UL><LI>In colorectal cancer: no evidence survival is
improved. </LI>
<LI>Gastric cancer: no clear evidence. </LI>
<LI>Pancreatic cancer: Study completely negative. Longer
survival in control (untreated) group. </LI>
<LI>Bladder: no clinical trial done. </LI>
<LI>Breast cancer: No direct evidence that chemotherapy
prolongs survival; its use is &quot;ethically
questionable.&quot; (That is particularly newsworthy, since
all breast cancer patients, before or after surgery, are
given chemotherapy drugs.) </LI>
<LI>Ovarian cancer: no direct evidence. </LI>
<LI>Cervix and uterus: No improved survival. </LI>
<LI>Head and neck: no survival benefit but occasional
shrinkage of tumors. </LI>
</UL>
<P>More recently, the Nov. 17, 1994 Wall Street Journal, in
a front page article on political pressure being exerted for
insurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants in
advanced breast cancer, experts give a totally negative
report on this approach. The procedure, called ABMT
(Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant) involves temporarily
removing some of the patient's bone marrow, applying a
potentially lethal dose of chemotherapy, then returning the
marrow to the patient's body. The cost of this procedure is
in excess of $100,000.00 . </P>
<P>The University of Colorado's Dr. Jones, continues the
Journal, claims that, with conventional chemotherapy, not
more than 2% of patients with spreading breast cancer get a
positive response. A non-profit independent technology
assessment agency, the Emergency Care Research Institute
(ECRI), says that for the average woman with the most
advanced form of breast cancer, the high dose ABMT procedure
is not only worthless, but also likely to shorten her life.
This report by the ECRI is based on an analysis of 40 studies
of ABMT and similar procedures involving a total of 1,017
patients, and 61 studies covering 4,852 patients who had
conventional chemotherapy. Dr. Nelson Erlick, the project's
lead analyst, concluded that &quot;many patients are led to
believe that this (ABMT) is a successful therapy. We found no
evidence whatsoever that it provides any benefit.&quot; </P>
<P>Since the Gerson Therapy is often described by orthodox
oncologists as 'quackery', we'd like our readers to consider
this: If quackery describes an expensive treatment that the
technician knows ahead of time to be ineffective (or even
harmful), what is ABMT (bone marrow transplant)? Yet health
plan providers are being ordered to pay for it by the Office
of Personnel Management, a federal agency. </P>
