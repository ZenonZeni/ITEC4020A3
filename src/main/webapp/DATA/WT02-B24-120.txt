The Honorable William F. Winter, Chairman<br>
U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations<br>
600 K Street, N W<br>
Suite 450 South Building<br>
Washington, DC 20575<br>
<p>
Dear Governor Winter:
<p>
LDA, the Learning Disabilities Association of America, is a national, 
non-profit volunteer organization whose membership is approximately 60,000. 
Our membership is comprised of individuals with learning disabilities, their 
families and friends, and the professionals who serve them and is dedicated to 
improving the lives of individuals with learning disabilities. Over half of the
children served under IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
are identified as learning disabled. The effectiveness of IDEA in preparing 
these children to be productive citizens is demonstrated by the increasing 
number of students with learning disabilities who go on to college or into 
competitive employment.
<p>
LDA is very concerned about the recommendations regarding IDEA which appear in 
the revised draft of the  ACIR (Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental 
Relations) report to Congress for the  following reasons:
<ul>
<li>
The ACIR, which was created by the Unfunded Mandates Law of 1995, has no 
authority to make recommendations about IDEA because that legislation 
specifically pointed out that IDEA is NOT an unfunded mandate.<br>
<li>
States clearly have the responsibility to provide an education to all their 
children. Children with disabilities are entitled to the same educational 
opportunities as their non-disabled peers. The funding provided by IDEA is 
intended to help the states to provide those opportunities. The "prescriptive 
administrative and record keeping requirements" of the law are intended to 
ensure that federal funds are spent wisely for the purposes for which they were 
intended.<br>
<li>
The report perpetuates the myth that IDEA is not a litigious law. LDA has no 
objection to the use of mediation as an alternative to due process because it 
benefits both children with learning disabilities and the school systems which 
serve them. However, children with disabilities and their families must retain 
the right to redress wrongs under the law.
</ul>
<p>
Because IDEA is clearly exempt from the Unfunded Mandates LAW and because the 
reauthorization of IDEA now being considered by Congress addresses some of the 
concerns expressed in the ACIR report, LDA urges you to remove all reference to 
the IDEA in your final report.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Sandra Britt<br>
President, LDA
