<H2>4. EOC SCIENCE PROJECTS PLAN<BR>
<HR></H2>
The EOC Science Plan has been based on the recommendations of the Simpson
Report (Simpson <I>et al</I>., 1995), the Draft Science Plan Discussion
Document (Graetz <I>et al</I>., 1995), and a document supporting the appointment
of the Science Program Leader (Jupp, 1995). These have lead to the formulation
of the EOC Strategic Science Plan. The Science Projects Plan has also been
based on the document supporting the common software initiative (Prata,
1996) and incorporates ideas presented in a document presented at the AVHRR
Working Group at the 8th Australasian Remote Sensing Conference on the implementation
of standards (Jupp, 1996b, McVicar, 1996). All of these documents may be
accessed at the EOC WWW site (http://www.eoc.csiro.au).<BR>
<BR>
Some EOC Tasks exist already and others have already progressed through
the Working Group phase and are initial Tasks for the EOC to address. The
most pressing of these is in the area of AVHRR processing which can be classed
as forming an Implementation Team to resolve the problem of there being
no accepted CSIRO standard of processing. It is therefore proposed that
a primary initial new EOC task be defined to address the AVHRR processing
issue and that proposals for Working Groups be invited to develop the project
portfolio for the EOC. The AVHRR area has already been examined by a Working
Group (Prata <I>et al</I>., 1996) and its recommendations form a basis for
the steps outlined below. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15458863"></A>4.1 Existing Projects</H3>
The existing projects and special budget items are: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Global change<BR>
2. Global 1km data archive<BR>
3. Support for international project &amp; working group activities<BR>
4. Support for TERSS &amp; WASTAC<BR>
5. Data acquisition &amp; Networks<BR>
6. Information Products<BR>
7. Information Management Systems<BR>
8. CIGSN<BR>
9. GMS Pathfinder<BR>
10. EOC Calibration and Spectral Laboratory Development<BR>
11. Various small applications projects</BLOCKQUOTE>
CIGSN will be invited to merge with the new developments in CalVal, GMS
Pathfinder will merge with the generic studies and CalVal and the small
applications will be invited to refine their activities in the light of
EOC objectives and activities.<BR>
<BR>
The area of Data Acquisition and Networks will be reviewed after an EOC/DIT
Working Group has examined possible utilisation of the DHPC CRC data network.
The Information Management Systems may be reviewed after the CEOS Plenary.<BR>
<BR>
Funds will continue to support attendance at PI/AO or other scientific meetings,
CEOS &amp; MODIS Working Groups, support an EOC Fellow and provide contributions
to various data collection enterprises. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15459543"></A>4.2 AVHRR Processing Implementation</H3>
As a result of recommendations by the COSSA Steering Committee, the operations
in AVHRR data acquisition and processing at Aspendale and Hobart have been
assessed to increase effectiveness and maximise the benefits of the work
that has been done at the two sites for the benefit of the respective Divisions
and CSIRO.<BR>
<BR>
As initial steps in this process, it was decided to phase out data acquisition
at Aspendale and data are now supplied from the facility at Hobart. Data
from Hobart, Townsville, Darwin, Manila and Casey are also being supplied
to and archived through the Global One-kilometre data project in Canberra.
However, it is clear that the process has further to go and must involve
a development of a common base of software (Prata, 1996) and the definition
and incorporation of best practice algorithms. This will provide a proving
ground for CSIRO's approach to the data archiving and dissemination it needs
and to the development of a strong and complementary relationship between
CSIRO research and the operational data management activities of the Bureau
of Meteorology.<BR>
<BR>
As an initial project focus that builds on the established base of the COSSA/MDP19/EOC
progression and to meet the urgent user driven need to develop consistent
and high quality standards in AVHRR processing it is proposed to: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Decide on the operation of the Hobart AVHRR receiving facility,
including possible EOC management and relationship with Aspendale. Review
cost structures and establish a cost effective source for raw data until
it can be provided by a Bureau of Meteorology based data supply which is
suitable for CSIRO researchers.<BR>
2. With the Bureau of Meteorology and other data users and suppliers, implement
and support the established new common data format. This has been established
by cooperation between CSIRO and BoM.<BR>
3. Establish a focused Science Team to specify in detail actions will support
the short and long term common software and software engineering and developmental
environment (CAPS) which has been proposed in the AVHRR Working Group (Prata,
1996). The result will be an ATBD including algorithms specified in an industry
standard Algorithm Description Language.<BR>
4. Establish and demonstrate a base processing capability which consistently
and measurably achieves 1km Root Mean Square (RMS) navigation errors and
5% RMS calibration error levels. This will form the standard Base Product
which has been developed as one which (if consistently produced to a certifiable
standard) will satisfy a major class of end users.<BR>
5. Actively promote the standards set with other data suppliers. In particular,
AIMS, BoM and WASTAC. The achievement of these standards may not be by use
of CSIRO common software although this is a desirable option.<BR>
6. Establish and demonstrate the best CSIRO recommended options for cloud
masking and removal of cloud and cloud shadow contaminated pixels. Establish
and demonstrate the options available for NDVI image generation. Actively
promote these with other data suppliers.<BR>
7. Establish the CSIRO recommended advanced algorithms, publish them in
an ATBD in the Algorithm Description Language and implement selected products
in the CAPS system.<BR>
8. Interact closely with AVHRR product suppliers, standards organisations
and end users to define the best and most practical validation procedures
currently available for AVHRR products.<BR>
9. Establish the set of measurable standards for base and advanced processing
and establish the sites and tools to demonstrate the benefits of following
well defined standards to Australian and other users.<BR>
10. Develop the One-kilometer data set as an Australian continent and Extended
Economic Zone (EEZ) wide base data set to the established consistent base
standard in the new format. Promote the eventual operation and management
of the facility as an Agency responsibility provided the time series remains
accessible to CSIRO researchers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Activities 4, 6, 7 and 10 will be developed in the Canberra EOC Headquarters
with collocated staff from Hobart, Aspendale and Canberra. Activity 9 will
be done in conjunction with the EOC calibration &amp; validation activity.
The common software base for product development will be available to the
participating groups for future work in AVHRR applications meeting the client
needs of the Divisions and the make-up of the advanced algorithm set will
be defined with close cooperation and participation of CSIRO Divisions and
other contributing groups.<BR>
<BR>
The lack of a consistent base standard in Australia is a national problem
that CSIRO can show leadership to resolve. It will provide an underpinning
base for the advanced CSIRO products and the advanced end user oriented
product development that will meet the needs of CSIRO Sector clients.<BR>
The plan for this activity is to satisfy the immediate needs by setting
a small group to work within an adequate but short timeframe to complete
and demonstrate the base processing software standards within the first
year of full EOC operation (1996/97). The goals can be achieved with a critical
mass of scientists and support staff that currently exist at the EOC and
in Divisions and are engaged at least partially in this activity. The advanced
algorithms will be implemented in the second year. At present as described
in the Simpson Report (Simpson <I>et al</I>., 1995), AVHRR processing activity
is variable, research fragmented and the products not fully effective. This
is especially the case with software where the existence and operation of
widely varying software suites (sometimes evolving from the same initial
base) has created many problems.<BR>
