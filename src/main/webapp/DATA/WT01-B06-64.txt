Mutual Funds: To Sell, or Not to Sell?</H2><P>
<HR>

The need to ultimately sell a mutual fund should be kept in mind whenever you're selecting a new fund. It's good to at least have a general idea of how long you'll want to remain invested.<p>


But broadly speaking, aside from adjustments dictated by a market timing or asset allocation strategy, or changes in personal circumstances, the main reason for contemplating a sale is that a fund is not living up to your expectations. <p>


Everyone should be prepared to jettison investments that aren't living up to expectations. When making this decision, you re-evaluate the same factors you considered when buying. Fund prospectuses and profiles in mutual fund guidebooks should be studied at least once a year to keep abreast of changing fundamentals.<p>


The reasons for becoming dissatisfied fall into several categories.<p>

<blockquote><strong>Performance: </strong>For most people this should be the single most important consideration. If a value-oriented, large-cap stock fund has lagged its peers for perhaps two years, it might be time to switch. You should also check to see how the portfolio has fared relative to an appropriate index. You can, for example, compare a growth and income fund against the S&P 500, a small stock portfolio with the Russell 2000, an international fund with the Europe, Australia, Far East (EAFE) index, and a junk bond fund with the Salomon high-yield corporate bond index.<p>


<strong>Expenses, portfolio turnover and size: </strong>These are not primary considerations, but you should monitor them in your funds. An expense ratio that is climbing noticeably should be a cause for concern, since expenses drag down performance. A change in the portfolio turnover rate could reflect a change in management style. And size can be important if it could hurt performance--for instance, a small company growth fund that has become so big that its character has changed might be a candidate for selling.<p>


<strong>Services: </strong>This is typically not a critical factor, since most fund complexes try hard to deliver good service. But if your company's services aren't what you want them to be you should look elsewhere.<p>


<strong>Management:</strong> A change in management may or may not be a concern. You need to find out the explanation for the move and the background and qualifications of the person taking the helm.<p>


<strong>Mergers:</strong> A typical merger involves a small, poor-performing fund that is absorbed by a larger, better-performing fund within the same family--fund companies like to take the opportunity to erase the bad records of their losers. If you're a shareholder of the fund to be merged and you elect to stay, you would generally receive shares of the acquiring fund in what is normally a tax-free exchange. The objectives and track record of the acquiring fund are major considerations in the decision whether or not to sell.<p>
</blockquote>

You may be better off not selling in many situations. Here are some "don'ts" to consider.<p>

<ul>
<li>Don't sell too soon. The fact that a fund has performed so well for so long does not mean that it's going to have to do poorly in the future. There will always be a select group of funds, such as those on Forbes honor roll, that outperform the market for remarkably long spans.<p>


<li>Don't sell just after a big plunge, as on October 19, 1987. This is panic-selling, and many who sold at that time undoubtedly regretted it after they witnessed the subsequent, relatively speedy recovery. You never know exactly when the market and your fund might rebound. <p>


<li>Don't set mental "stop-loss" sell prices. Some people might want to bail out if their fund falls below, say, 5% or 10% of the present price, or what they paid for most of their shares. But, unlike some stocks, funds should not be sold just because their prices are declining. However, volatile sector and single-country funds, which often act like stocks, should be treated differently.<p>


<li>Think twice about selling a fund on which you have a large unrealized gain. Selling can give rise to an unnecessary tax liability if your fund is in a taxable account. Your pretax return is reduced by the amount of any taxes paid on realized gains.<p>


<li>Think twice before selling one of your funds to invest in another that was recommended to you. The recommended fund may already have had a good run-up in price. But if you feel the suggestion has merit, do your own investigation before making any moves.<p>
</ul>

The sell decision is often more difficult than the initial decision to buy. That's why you should have a well thought-out investment plan that you follow consistently over the years. By sticking with the plan, you are less likely to be swayed by short-term market developments. However, remember that "forever" is not a meaningful time horizon for any investor.<p>
