<P>
Weeds are Australia's greatest pest, costing about $3.3 billion a year in lost production, decreased quality and control measures. The CRC for Weed Management Systems was established in July 1995 to conduct and co-ordinate innovative research resulting in practical,integrated weed management systems.
These will increase productivity and product quality, decrease costs, enhance sustainability and conserve biodiversity in natural and agricultural ecosystems.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Participants have expertise in education, weed-management extension, agricultural economics, weed-management policy, weed biology and ecology, weed-population dynamics and modelling, biological control, crop and pasture agronomy, herbicide biochemistry and herbicide-formulation technology.
Industry participants represent the major agricultural industries and the environment protection industry. Resources include state-of-the-art facilities for biological control (in Australia and overseas), herbicide technology laboratories, plant research laboratories, greenhouses, insect-rearing facilities and training facilities.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Most of the work of the CRC will be carried out for public good. Commercial products will be developed: print and electronic advice, support publications, training courses, transgenic crop and pasture cultivars and, possibly, mycoherbicides and new herbicide formulations.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The CRC for Weed Management Systems is headquartered in South Australia. The Victorian partner is the Keith Turnbull Research Institute (Department of Conservation and Natural Resources). It is a key participant in the CRC because of its extensive experience and resources in the integrated management of weeds in temperate Australia.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Training is a very important role of the CRC. A suite of weed science and weed-management programs is being implemented to offer for the first time in Australia a co-ordinated approach to educating undergraduates, postgraduates, professional land and natural resource managers, and the community.
The Communication and Adoption Program aims to interact with researchers and land managers, to communicate the results of weed research and foster the adoption of resulting weed-management strategies.
