<B>MURDERING JOURNALISTS WITH IMPUNITY</B><p>

<B>Assassinations, Disappearances, and Attacks 
Related to Coverage of Chechnya</B><p>

Skirmishes between the national media and the candidates in Moscow have distracted international attention from the most egregious attacks on press freedom in the pre-election season: the killing of journalists in Chechnya, particularly two recent and appalling execution-style murders of women journalists.<p>

<ul><li><CITE>Obshchaya Gazeta</CITE>  correspondent <B>Nadezhda Chaikova</B> was found murdered execution-style on March 30, 1996, in the village of Gekhi, about 20 kilometers outside Grozny. In a follow-up to a conversation in early May, Chaikova's colleagues reiterated to CPJ on June 11 that the federal Russian prosecutor's office still has not opened an investigation into her death and that the local Chechen village prosecutor who originally took up the case is unlikely to get far because of limited resources. The editors of <CITE>Obshchaya Gazeta</CITE>,  a respected weekly with a circulation of about 10,000, have mounted their own investigation and have sent reporters to the scene to check various hypotheses of her murder.<p> 

A statement by a local official and a note by Chaikova point to federal troops as the suspects. But other clues indicate that Chechen leaders themselves may have ordered her death, believing that she was a spy and perhaps acting on rumors spread by the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB). No firm allegation can be made because no central Russian investigation has been opened.<p>

Chaikova was seen in Sernovodsk on March 19 by Jaromir Stetin of the Czech news agency Epicenter, when she filed her report from the blockaded village, and on March 20 by <CITE>Komsomolskaya Pravda</CITE>  reporter Alexander Yevtushenko. They reported that Chaikova was headed for Samashki and had plans to disguise herself as a Chechen peasant woman in order to cover the news there. She was often known to dress in a kerchief and long black skirt to appear "just like a local," according to <CITE>Obshchaya Gazeta</CITE>  correspondent Alexander Trushin.<p>

Trushin and colleagues from the Russian wire services ITAR-TASS and Postfactum went to Chechnya in early April to look for Chaikova after she had been missing for more than 10 days and had failed to make a scheduled phone call to the newspaper's editorial offices in Moscow. The journalists started their search in Grozny, showing crowds of demonstrators Chaikova's picture, then worked their way through Chechen villages, some recently bombed by federal troops, interviewing residents there and placing ads about her disappearance on local commercial television stations. <p>

In Samashki, a local government official reported that Chaikova had spent the night of March 20-21 in his village, then had left with refugees through a safe corridor made by the Russian military and was reportedly headed toward Zakan-Yurt-Kulary. "Go look for her at the federals' [Russian federal troops' base]," the official instructed Trushin. "She had a camera and photographed everything they committed here." At the time, Russian troops were surrounding Samashki while they completed mop-up operations, detaining many civilians suspected of harboring guerrillas. <p>
Chechen fighters then told Trushin and his colleagues that an unidentified woman had been buried in a neighboring village and advised them to inquire at the Urus-Martanovsky District prosecutor's office. There the reporters discovered photographs that clearly indicated that Chaikova had been beaten, blindfolded, forced into a kneeling position, and shot in the back of the head. The prosecutor explained that her body had been discovered on the outskirts of Gekhi near a sewage pipe, but that a forensic examination indicated that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dumped outside the village. Villagers buried her in their local cemetery in a Muslim ceremony. The body was exhumed April 12, and the Moscow correspondents made a positive identification.<p>

 

<li><B>Nina Yefimova,</B> a 25-year-old Russian reporter who resided in Chechnya, was found dead on May 9, 1996, from a pistol shot to the back of the head. According to ITAR-TASS, both Nina and her mother were abducted from their apartment on the outskirts of Grozny on the night of May 8. Yefimova's body was found the following morning in Grozny's Leninsky District, while her 73-year-old mother was found dead on the night of May 9 in a deserted canned food factory in Grozny. A local law enforcement official who declined to give reporters his name claimed that Yefimova's murder was committed "for private reasons," but journalists in Grozny and Moscow believe that her assassination was related to stories she had published on crime in Chechnya. On May 10, the deputy interior minister of Chechnya told the radio station Ekho Moskvy that an investigation was opened and that suspects had been identified.<p>

Yefimova was a contributor to <CITE>Vozrozhdeniye </CITE> [Revival], a Russian-language newspaper distributed in Chechnya. Although owned by the Moscow-installed government of Doku Zavgayev, <CITE>Vozrozhdeniye</CITE>  was described as relatively independent by the Glasnost Defense Foundation (GDF), a Moscow-based media watchdog group. <p>

<li>On March 11, 1996, <B>Viktor Pimenov,</B> a cameraman for Vaynakh, the national Chechen television station controlled by the pro-Moscow government, was killed in Grozny. ITAR-TASS reported that day that "Pimenov was shot in the back by a sniper hiding on the roof of a 16-floor building on Lenin Street." He was killed while filming the aftermath of the Chechen insurgents' raid on Grozny from March 6 to March 9, during which Russian military officials kept all journalists out of the city.</ul><p>

Throughout the war, Russian soldiers have been known to fire on vehicles duly identified as carrying journalists. One such incident had a deadly outcome.<p>

<ul><li>On June 17, 1995, <B>Natalya Alyakina,</B> a free-lance correspondent of dual German-Russian citizenship who worked for the German radio news service RUFA and the weekly magazine <CITE>Focus,</CITE>  was shot dead by a Russian soldier just minutes after being waved past a Russian checkpoint outside the city of Budyonnovsk at the height of the hostage crisis. Her driver was seriously injured. Sergei Fedotov, the soldier who fired the shot, claimed it was an accident, but circumstances suggest that it was not, and serious blunders were made in the official re-enactment of the crime during the investigation. On Feb. 13, 1996, the investigation was closed and the case was handed to a military judge in Stavropol to try the soldier on the minor charge of "misuse of a weapon." Eyewitnesses, including Alyakina's husband, Gisbert Mrozek, a German correspondent for RUFA, have repeatedly protested to Russian officials the slow and inept handling of the case. Last year, information released to Mrozek and a colleague by Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Medvedev, indicated that a different soldier may have been the perpetrator, or that two soldiers may have been involved. Currently the judge is postponing any examination of this latest hypothesis. And only through the strenuous efforts of his lawyer has Mrozek himself been called as a witness in the trial. He had been sitting next to his wife in the car when she was shot.<p>

The military court in Stavropol announced that the trial would open in May, but the hearing was cancelled when some of the state's witnesses failed to appear. The next session has been postponed until after the June 16 elections. </ul><p>

Currently four correspondents, including one American photojournalist from Pennsylvania, are missing and presumed dead in Chechnya.<p>

<ul><li><B>Maxim Shabalin,</B> the assistant political editor of the St. Petersburg daily <CITE>Nevskoye Vremya</CITE>,  and <B>Felix Titov,</B> a photographer for the paper, have been missing in Chechnya for more than a year and are presumed dead. The two experienced war correspondents had left Nazran on Feb. 27, 1995, for their sixth trip to Chechnya since the fighting began. According to <CITE>Nevskoye Vremya's</CITE> editor in chief, the journalists were due back on March 4 but were never heard from again. Colleagues at <CITE>Nevskoye Vremya</CITE>  received word in September that the bodies of two journalists were found in February in the Achoy region of the republic. But there were no documents or photographs to confirm the identities of the bodies.<p>

<li><CITE>Nevskoye Vremya</CITE>   reporter <B>Sergei Ivanov</B> traveled to Chechnya on June 16, 1995, to look for Shabalin and Titov, but he never returned, and no trace of him has been found. In recent months the newspaper's correspondents have repeatedly queried high-ranking Russian and Chechen officials about their three lost colleagues but have not been given any concrete information about their fate. One top Russian official commented to a reporter, "We know everything, but we are not telling." The newspaper has since stopped its on-site coverage of Chechnya.<p>

<li><B>Andrew Shumack,</B> an American free-lance journalist from Pocono Pines, Pa., was last seen on July 28, 1995, when he left the Chechen capital of Grozny and headed toward the surrounding mountainous area. <CITE>The St. Petersburg Press,</CITE>  an English-language newspaper, had provided Shumack with a letter of introduction on July 20 to help him obtain press credentials. In return, Shumack was to provide them with photographs and stories for three months. He is feared dead because no one from the newspaper has heard from him since, and U.S. Embassy officials have not been able to locate him, despite repeated trips to the region, where they have circulated a flyer with his photograph to humanitarian organizations.</ul><p>

In addition to the murders and disappearances of journalists covering the Chechen war, there was one recent failed attempt on the life of <B>Alexander Minkin,</B> a <CITE>Moskovsky Komsomolets</CITE>  commentator known for his bitter satirical accounts of Yeltsin, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, and the government's actions in Chechnya.<p>

<ul><li>On Feb. 20, 1996, at 4:20 a.m., Minkin and his wife were awakened by the sound of breaking glass from the balcony of their second-story apartment. As two pipe-wielding masked intruders stumbled over television wires and a crate of apples near the doorway, the Minkins were able to escape and call the police. This was the second attack on Minkin; in September 1995, he suffered a fractured nose in a beating by unknown assailants near his home. On March 18, 1996, <CITE>The Los Angeles Times</CITE>  quoted Minkin as saying: "Everyone is afraid because it is obvious who is behind this. Who else besides the leadership could be interested in killing me?"</ul><p>

At least two journalists are known to be imprisoned in Chechnya for attempting to enter the region:<p>

<ul><li><B>Ali Tekin,</B> managing editor of the Turkish Islamic weekly Selam, and <B>Talip Ozcelik,</B> a reporter with the paper, were arrested on Nov. 2, 1995, while trying to enter Chechnya. Russian authorities told the journalists' colleagues that they were detained for "illegal entry." The pair were first held in Derbent and are now believed to be detained in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. According to the Anatolia News Agency, on April 10, 1996, a court in Dagestan sentenced Tekin and Ozcelik under Article 83 of the Russian Penal Code to three years in prison--the maximum sentence permitted under the law--for illegal border-crossing.</ul><p>

<CITE>Reporting Conditions in Chechnya*</CITE><p>

In general, reporting conditions in Chechnya have been dangerous--at least four journalists have been killed by cross fire--and difficult. Correspondents must file stories from poorly working, government-controlled phone lines; and foreigners who attempt to get around this obstacle must rent costly satellite telephones. In order to obtain accreditation and permission to move around in the area, reporters are heavily dependent on the good graces of the Moscow-installed Chechen government and the Russian federal troops. Those who disobey the rules are vulnerable to attack.<p>

<ul><li>In January 1996, journalists attempting to follow the Chechen hostage crisis that spilled over into neighboring Dagestan were held at bay, attacked by guard dogs, shot at, detained, and fed misinformation by Russian soldiers and officials. Initially, on Jan. 10, officials only allowed crews from state-controlled television and a small, arbitrarily chosen group of reporters access to the site of the hostage seizure in the village of Pervomayskoye. On Jan. 16, Peter Ford of the Christian Science Monitor encountered a road block five miles outside of the village, and when he attempted to ask a militiaman a question, the militiaman let loose a German shepherd, who bit Ford, seriously wounding him above his right knee. An ABC correspondent and cameraman were also attacked by guard dogs. When a New York Times reporter attempted to drive by a checkpoint, his car was fired upon by soldiers in a Russian military jeep. On the previous day, a Worldwide Television News agency producer and cameraman gained entry into Pervomayskoye, but authorities detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. Russian officials repeatedly told journalists that the reason for the attack on the village was that two policemen had been hanged; this turned out to be untrue.</ul>

In May, prosecutors sent a terse reply to CPJ's letter protesting these incidents. They wrote that the investigation had been discontinued because no perpetrators were able to be identified.

<B><H3>Contract Killings in Moscow and the Provinces</H3></B>

In addition to the slayings and attacks related to the war in Chechnya, CPJ is gravely concerned about the unsolved murders of eight journalists who were killed for their reporting in Moscow and the provinces. These have had a chilling effect on the behavior of Russian journalists and have left the stage open for future attacks. Whether or not the Yeltsin government is involved, through their inaction, Russian authorities are tacitly signaling would-be attackers that they can murder journalists with impunity.<p>

As David Satter, a former Moscow correspondent for the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> and a former CPJ program coordinator, wrote in CPJ's <CITE><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../attacks95/att95index.html">Attacks on the Press in 1995:</A></CITE> "[Russian journalists] risk their lives if they report on organized crime or corruption in the armed forces or if the financial interests of their media organization bring them into conflict with a corrupt group. ... More unsettling than the killings themselves, however, has been the attitude of the Russian authorities. Despite the fact that a number of the murdered journalists have been national celebrities, there has been little effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Instead, after a journalist is murdered, an investigation begins, sometimes with considerable fanfare, and the effort then fades amid signs that investigators are being hampered by interference at a high official level."<p>

When CPJ or domestic press freedom groups raise the issue with Russian officials, we are told that law enforcement offices are overwhelmed in general by the wave of organized crime in the country. A widely cited government report claims that 80 to 90 percent of private business in Russia is controlled by or forced to pay extortion money to organized crime groups. According to ITAR-TASS, Valery Serebryakov of the Chief Directorate for Organized Crime reported that there were 5,000 criminal gangs in Russia with 32,000 members, and that of those 5,000 gangs, 100 have international ties.<p>

According to a Reuter dispatch on April 12, 1996, Interfax quoted Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov as saying that 35 percent of crimes that took place in 1995 have not been investigated, including 8,000 murders. Skuratov told the lower house of parliament in a hearing that investigators, overloaded with work and underpaid, even fail to register two out of every three crimes. The newspaper <CITE>Trud</CITE> reported on May 18 that of the nation's murders, some 500 were identified as contract killings, of which only 61 were solved. Skuratov has met with the Russian media watchdog group Glasnost Defense Foundation to discuss the cases, and his subordinates have politely--but not substantively--replied to CPJ's letters of concern.<p>

CPJ, which conducted a fact-finding mission to Russia in November 1995, notes that in most of the murder cases it has documented, the journalists appear to have been writing about the very issue the government is trying to cope with--the underworld and its heavy influence on Russian business and politics. Investigative journalism is clearly needed in Russia, but it can be lethal to carry out. In May, yet another journalist was killed in a gangland-style hit:<p>

<ul><li><B>Viktor Mikhailov</B>, a reporter for a leading daily regional newspaper, <CITE>Zabaikalsky Rabochy</CITE> [Trans-Baikal Worker], was killed in Chita, a city in southeastern Siberia. His mutilated body was found on May 13, 1996. According to Interfax and AP dispatches on May 13, Mikhailov covered law enforcement and crime agencies in Siberia.</ul> <p>

 Some of the cases still not brought to trial are as follows:<p>

<ul><li>On Oct. 17, 1994, <B>Dmitry Kholodov,</B> 27, an investigative reporter for Moscow's largest daily <CITE>Moskovsky Komsomolets,</CITE> was killed in his office when he opened a briefcase that exploded and shattered the lower part of his body. He had picked up the attach&eacute; case at Kazan Station after receiving an anonymous telephone tip about a story he was working on involving corruption in the armed forces. Yeltsin said he would personally supervise the investigation, but Pavel Gusev, editor of the paper, told CPJ in November 1995 that the investigation was "running in place." Gusev and his colleagues have conducted their own investigation and said they would print their allegations if they became completely convinced that the official inquiry was going nowhere. Seven months later, the official investigation has not progressed, and Gusev has not made any public statements, a fact that has drawn criticism from journalists outside the newspaper.<p>

<li>On March 1, 1995, <B>Vladislav Listyev,</B> the executive director of Russian Public Television (ORT), was shot dead as he entered his apartment block. The murder was apparently connected to his role in the reorganization of the state-owned Ostankino television company as ORT, a joint stock venture. One of Listyev's first actions after assuming his position was to suspend all advertising at the station in order to re-examine the station's controversial and corrupt dealings with mafia-controlled intermediary firms selling advertising time at inflated prices. It is widely believed that an Ostankino advertising syndicate contracted Listyev's killing, but even with such obvious leads, no real progress has been made. The investigation has been riddled with personnel changes, infighting between the prosecutor's office and the Federal Security Service (FSB), claims that suspects already in custody from other investigations are related to the case, and periodic rumors released to the press from "competent sources" stating falsely that arrests have been made. <p>

Boris Berezovsky, owner of the Logovaz group, has a large share of the investment in the partially private stations ORT and TV-6 and in two leading independent periodicals, the newspaper <CITE>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</CITE> and the magazine <CITE>Ogonyok</CITE>. He himself was the victim of an attack in 1994 that forced him to seek medical treatment and temporary refuge abroad. In an April 8, 1996, interview with the Moscow bureau of the Russian emigr&eacute; daily <CITE>Novoye Russk
