Mike Nelson claims to be mystified at the Washington Post's
statement that the White House has retained the right to restrict
encryption technology. That statement comes from the White House's own
background papers distributed at the NIST announcement. The statement,
delivered in question-and answer form, asked whether the administration
would restrict access to encryption technology if it could not get what
it needed from the just-announced Clipper plan. The answer was that these
are fundamental issues and are still under consideration--not a "no"
answer. <p>

I hope this clears up the misunderstanding.
