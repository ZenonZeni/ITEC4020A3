JAPAN:  MITI LINKS WITH VISA ON INTERNET

IN AN EFFORT to develop a global platform for electronic commerce,
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), recently
launched the "Smart Commerce Japan" project, which will allow Japanese
consumers to use a Visa card to pay for goods found in the virtual
shopping malls of the Internet. This forms part of the MITI's overall
strategy to promote a wider range of applications for electronic
commerce.

According to Visa, the pilot of the Smart Commerce Japan project will
involve the distribution of 35,000 chip cards which will conform to the
EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) specifications, together with
compact stored-value card readers, to current Visa cardholders who have
experience using the Internet.

A source at Visa Japan told SCB that other Internet projects are also
being conceived by the ministry. Following the test of Smart Commerce
Japan, it is expected the MITI will develop other electronic data
interchange (EDI) type systems for the Internet.

Other systems being envisioned will facilitate the exchange of
trade-related information between individuals and corporations on the
Internet, with later systems allowing similar exchanges between
corporations.

The Smart Commerce Japan project is slated for a pilot debut in the
first quarter of 1997. It is believed to be the world's first system to
combine the EMV-compatible integrated chip card for electronic
commerce. Other payment systems available on the Internet are based on
conventional magnetic stripe technology.

The project will allow Visa cardholders to use their card not only for
credit and debit transactions but also for stored-value transactions on
the Internet. Cardholders might even be able to load up their
reloadable stored-value cards on special terminals in their homes.

Team leader of Smart Commerce Japan, Toshiba Corporation, said the
project will promote electronic shopping and put powerful chip cards
into the hands of thousands of Japanese consumers.

The project is undertaken by a consortium headed by Toshiba and will
also involve international credit card association, Visa International,
Daiei Group, Japan's largest retailer and the Hankyu Toho Group, a
diversified entertainment, retail and transportation group.

A spokesperson for Toshiba said the company's role in the project will
involve the provision of system integration from the EMV compatible
chip card and related devices to back-end servers.

According to Visa, the lack of security for financial transactions over
open networks has hampered the development of electronic commerce. To
overcome this constraint, Toshiba and Visa have revealed that they will
be working to develop hardware applications to facilitate secure
payment over the Internet. It is expected that when the pilot commences
in the first quarter of 1997, a common application standard will
already be in place.

Visa International had earlier partnered software giant, Microsoft, to
develop Secure Transaction Technology (STT), an open standard for
security and payment applications. Visa would not confirm whether
Microsoft are involved in the Japanese project.

A source at MasterCard, the other international card association
currently developing a standard for secured Internet payment
transactions, said: "It is perplexing that for Internet transactions,
which are global in nature, it is necessary to create a Japanese
standard for secured payment. We will certainly be watching this
project with interest."

The source at Visa, however, said there is no intention to create a
Japanese standard for secured transactions. "The objective is not to
create a de facto standard, if another standard comes out and is well
accepted, we will use that. But what we do want to create is
international operability. There will eventually be a commonality of
standards between what Visa and MasterCard are attempting to do."

A spokesman for Toshiba said: "We will adopt a world-standard security
technology, which is compatible with the settlement system for
EMV-based IC cards."

It is understood that Toshiba will co-operate with Netscape
Communications Corporation, a leading Internet-related software
provider, to develop the Internet platform for the project. It will
also develop the system for EMV chip transactions over the Internet, as
well as the Sun Microsystems' Java-based interface software between the
EMV chip card and the transaction system.

Visa said that, during the pilot, experiments will be conducted to find
ways to deliver the convenience of shopping in cyberspace to those who
do not own a home PC, such as the construction of"Virtual Mall Kiosks"
placed in convenient locations. Several credit card issuers, major
retailers and Japan's leading banks will be involved in the pilot.

MONDEX HIRES EXEC FOR AMERICAN EXPANSION

MONDEX International has hired a US-based executive as another effort
by the NatWest-led smart card project to build franchises throughout
North and South America.

Timothy Stewart, who worked for AT&T's corporate strategy and business
development office, will be a US-based liaison to Mondex International.
Stewart formally begins work this month, out of his New Jersey
residence, according to Tim Jones, Mondex International's chief
executive.

Jones introduced Stewart to bankers during the BAI Retail Delivery Show
in Atlanta. According to Jones, Stewart will be a "relationship manager
for all of the Americas", with Canada, the US and other national
subsidiaries reporting through his office.

"We'd like to get Canada and the US operational on an integrated basis
and then expand southward," to Latin America, Stewart told SCB in a
recent interview. Stewart has a business as well as technical
background from his days with AT&T's Bell Laboratories, where he was
involved with research and development.

"If you're dealing with North American corporations, it's important to
have someone on the ground, in the same time zone, available for
meetings at short notice. He'll sweep the whole load of issues. We have
more people wanting to talk to us than we can cope with at the moment,"
Jones said, though he declined to identify the banks involved.

In the US, to date, Mondex has encountered heavy resistance and has not
yet been embraced. Detractors claim that US regulators will never
authorise Mondex because it is harder to audit and control centrally.

Mondex is the only electronic purse scheme that proposes card-to-card
transfers between users without requiring that transactions be routed
through a central clearing mechanism. This will only encourage tax
evasion and money laundering, critics have said.

But Stewart said he was optimistic that regulators at the office for
Comptroller of the Currency and the federal Reserve Board would be
convinced of security and integrity of the Mondex scheme.

In mid-1995, Mondex got its first foothold in the US at Wells Fargo
Bank, which initiated a test among fewer than 100 employees. Jones said
he hopes the $50 billion-asset San Francisco bank will roll out the
system and become a charter member of the Mondex USA franchise.

Elsewhere, according to an industry observer, NationsBank and NBD
Michigan (National Bank of Detroit) are said to be in discussions with
Mondex. Spokesmen from the two banks declined to comment.

There is also speculation that Midland Marine Bank of Buffalo will
participate, since it is owned by the UK Midland Bank, the other
founder of Mondex.

In another significant development last month, National Westminster
Group, which created Mondex in conjunction with Midland Group, sold New
Jersey-based subsidiary NatWest Bancorp.

The bank, which owns retail branches in the New York City area and a
credit card bank based in Delaware, was purchased by Fleet Financial
Group of Boston in a cash deal worth $3.26 billion. Jones said it had
been pretty obvious that NatWest USA would be an important part of
Mondex USA, but that discussions have already begun with Fleet.

PORTUGUESE KEEN ON PURSE

PORTUGAL'S SOCIEDADE Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) says it is
holding talks with a number of countries over the transfer of
technology and know-how of its Porta Moedas electronic purse, which was
launched in Portugal last year.

"The talks taking place are on two levels", explains Dra Carmo Alvim,
SIBS's head of marketing. "On the one hand, we are helping our Spanish
counterparts to actually set up their own electronic purse and, on the
other hand, we are providing, on a more general level, basic know-how
and information to countries as diverse as Israel, Brazil, the UK,
France and Canada".

She added that the Spanish electronic purse project should be up and
running by mid-1996."Both SIBS and the Spanish banking sector are keen
to make the two systems mutually acceptable, which means the Portuguese
will be able to use their electronic purse in Spain, and vice versa.

SIBS says the number of electronic purses in circulation is rising
faster than had been expected. Luis Cid, head of SIBS, recently told
journalists that Portugal issued in the month of October alone what it
took the Danish three years to achieve.

However, he conceded that the numbers are still well below the 10
million cards SIBS expects to be in circulation within the next five
years.

SIBS has already sold around 360,000 cards to the country's banks.
Until October 1995, over 100,000 cards were in circulation, with a
total loaded value of Esc174 million ($1.16 million). In the same
period, there were 7,028 POS terminals in operation, 4,343 of which
were off-line terminals exclusively for the electronic purse. Of this
number, 43 had been integrated into vending machines of various kinds.

The value of the average payment transaction (of which there were over
685,000 in the first nine months of the electronic purse's career) is
Esc370 ($2.5), which substitute for petty cash payments.

SIBS also says that the upgrading of the country's ATMs to accept
electronic purse loading facilities is virtually completed and that the
electronic purse will be usable nationwide within two years.

CARTE BLEUE BANKS GO LIVE WITH PURCHASING

THE FRENCH banks belonging to Groupement Carte Bleue have finally gone
live with the purchasing card service on their range of chip-based
products.

This information and payment system is now on offer to large
corporations that process small-value purchases by the "blue" banks,
that is, Societe Generale, Banque National de Paris and Credit
Lyonnais.

The average transaction value of items processed by these corporations
is estimated by Carte Bleue to be about Fr2,500 ($500). At the moment,
these purchases are carried out from a distance (by telephone, fax,
minitel or ordinary mail) in 90 percent of cases.

Every Carte Bleue member bank will be able to market the purchasing
service, and to personalise it, should it wish to do so, in order to
satisfy the requirements of its client companies.

The purchasing system, as it is defined today, will work from a common
operational core, which will have to evolve in order to become richer
as its market develops both nationally and internationally.

In 1994, the Groupement Carte Bleue conducted two studies of the way
potential customer firms viewed the service. What emerged from them was
that 38 percent of those surveyed expressed an interest in the service.

A study carried out in 1994 by Andersen Consulting evaluated the French
potential for service purchasing to be more than Fr110 billion, but
only took into account the market involving the country's 500 largest
firms in terms of turnover.

Jean-Marc Bornet, the chief executive of Carte Bleue, told CI that he
had great confidence in the future of the purchasing service: "The
question arose as to whether the purchasing service would be
experimented jointly once it had appeared in the Carte Bleue catalogue,
but the Groupement finally decided against this.

"French banks will, in fact, start off with the new product at their
own individual pace. It should be remembered that a large number of
telematic services are already offered to companies by French banks,
and the role of the purchasing service is to enrich the services
already available".

AUSTRALIA GEARS UP FOR SMART REVOLUTION

RECENTLY IDENTIFIED as one of the smart card centres of the world,
Australian consumers are expected to embrace chip technology with
enthusiasm. However, central bank regulators in the country have
expressed reservations about a possible loss of revenue if stored-value
cards (SVC) take off.

According to a report published by Visa International, called Payments
2001, the number of chip-based cards in Australia will swell to 27
million by the year 2001. Meanwhile, the number of consumers holding
cards is expected to rise to 2.8 million by the same year.

One of the greatest breakthroughs that will be facilitated by smart
cards is the ability to load funds on to the card at home. This could
be the catalyst for a massive increase in the use of home banking
services, said the report.

The Australian market also has the benefit of a sophisticated
telecommunications infrastructure. "The hurdles to connectivity are
already coming down. One fundamental is the broad band cable which is
being laid through Australian suburbs and which will not only provide
Australians with Pay TV but also all the utility of two-way data
communication in cyberspace."

In a survey conducted by Visa, Australian consumers were asked to
evaluate three stored-value options - a disposable card, a stand-alone
reloadable card and a multifunction card. The survey found that 72
percent of respondents favoured some form of stored-value function. Of
that figure, 44 percent want the chip embedded on their existing
credit/debit/ATM card. However, a substantial 37 percent preferred a
disposable card, while the remaining 19 percent opted for a reloadable
card.

Interestingly, disposable cards were preferred by those consumers who
thought of buying the cards for family and friends as gifts. "Almost 50
percent of Australian consumers would buy disposable cards for someone
else, and 40 percent would buy stand-alone reloadable cards for
others."

Another finding of the report was that 88 percent of consumers wanted
the capability to reload value onto their SVC at any ATM or eftpos
device and about 46 percent wanted the option of reloading the card at
home through a special device.

Identifying and signing the right merchants was given as an essential
requirement for the success of stored-value cards. Petrol stations were
highlighted as the most important, with 61 percent saying they wanted
to use their card there. Meanwhile, 60 percent identified grocery
stores, 40 percent pointed to payphones, 34 percent buses and trains,
and 29 percent mentioned post offices.

One issue which has not been resolved is the reaction of regulators to
a potentially radical shift in the means of payments. At the moment,
central banks earn money from issuing notes and coins, called
seigniorage.

According to Ray Jones, assistant secretary of the business finance and
superannuation branch of the Australian Federal Reserve: "The fiscal
impact of stored value cards will depend upon the speed and extent of
their market penetration. A sudden loss of a substantial revenue stream
would naturally have some public finance implications, but whether this
is a likely outcome is by no means clear at the moment."

According to Ian Harper in an article in The Australian Financial
Review, "they [stored-value] represent the first real threat to the use
of currency notes and coins in everyday payments. The bank and the
Treasury fear this may at last be about to change. And they have much
to lose."

However, he went on to say "there does not appear to be any significant
downward trend in seigniorage earned by the banks", but he attributed
this to the fact that stored-value cards are in their infancy.

Harper predicts that the Reserve Bank will not allow this revenue
stream disappear if stored-value does take off. "The bank also earns
seigniorage by obliging banks to hold compulsory reserves with it and
paying them low rates of interest or none at all. The trouble is that
banks might not be the main players in stored-value cards.

"The real worry for the Reserve Bank and the Treasury is the prospect
of multiple issuers which have no connection with the banking system at
all and no reason to pay seigniorage to the Reserve Bank," said Harper.
