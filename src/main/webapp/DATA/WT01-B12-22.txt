 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMPORTANT NUTRIENT </H2>

<P>   Next to Vitamin C, Vitamin E has probably received the most attention from researchers and is probably the next most important vitamin. Doctors Wilfred and Evan Shute were the first to show, years ago, that Vitamin E saved lives from myocardial infraction, which is the most common type of heart attack. They also gave Vitamin E to women who were pregnant to help them avoid complications. They found Vitamin E to be of great value in preventing miscarriages.</P>
<P>  The best food source of Vitamin E is whole grains, especially wheat. However, most individuals use white flour which has been stripped of all its Vitamin E. Vegetable oils are our next best source. However, most of the vegetable oils that are available commercially have been exposed to radiation, so free radicals have formed in them. This even increases our need for Vitamin E. In addition, the processing of the oils removes most of their Vitamin E, leaving an oil that gives no protection against the free radicals it easily forms.</P>
<P>   A National Institutes of Health study has revealed that the average dietary intake of Vitamin E is about 14 international units. They have also established an RDA of 30 units. It is easy to see from these figures that the average person receives less than half of the RDA for Vitamin E.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANT</H2>
<P>   Vitamin E is one of the best antioxidants known. One of its roles is to see that the oxygen in our bodies is not used on harmful or useless substances before it reaches the cells. Having adequate amounts of Vitamin E is more important today than ever before, because we are exposed to so many pollutants that interfere with healthy oxygen metabolism. Vitamin E is especially valuable for tissues that require lots of oxygen, such as the heart, brain and sex glands.</P>
<P>   Without adequate amounts of Vitamin E in the blood, our red blood cells break open and are destroyed. This condition is  referred  to  as  hemolytic  anemia  and  is  common  in newborn babies, especially those born prematurely. In the late 1960's astronauts on the Gemini mission developed this condition because their Vitamin E was quickly used up in the atmosphere they lived in. Since Vitamin E helps prevent anemia by protecting red blood cells from being destroyed by peroxides, it has been given to all astronauts since 1969 and this condition is no longer a problem.</P>
<P>  Breathing the air around some major cities can be hazardous to your health because of industrial and automotive pollution. The FDA has determined that a level as low as .05 parts per million of ozone is dangerous. They have shown that the toxicity of ozone is comparable to phosgene, a gas used in warfare. In Los Angeles, the ozone capital of the world, a typical concentration in the air is about 10 to 20 times the danger level.  Vitamin E blocks the damaging oxidation of healthy cells by ozone and is therefore a natural defense.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PREVENTION</H2>
<P>  Vitamin E helps to develop new veins between the existing ones. This helps the blood get from congested veins or varicose veins to more healthy ones. This is referred to as developing collateral circulation so the blood can circulate back to the heart.  Vitamin E can also help prevent intermittent claudication or lameness. Individuals with this condition can only walk short distances without developing severe leg cramps and pain.</P>
<P>  The estrogen related hormones in birth control pills neutralize Vitamin E and reduces its level in the blood stream.  Because Vitamin E naturally dissolves fibrin, the protein that organizes the formation of blood clots, women on "the pill" are known to be more prone to develop clots because Vitamin E levels are low. They should supplement with Vitamin E.</P>
<P>  Research has shown that reasonable levels of both Vitamin E and Selenium are necessary for either one of them to benefit our bodies. Unfortunately, the soils in certain areas of the U.S. are very deficient in selenium. Interestingly, the citizens of Rapid City, South Dakota have the highest blood levels of selenium and the lowest cancer rate in the U.S. On the other hand, Lima, Ohio has the highest rate of cancer and the lowest level of Selenium in the blood of its citizens. It is a good idea to make sure that your selenium levels are up to par as well. Selenium is included in <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>  and <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>. It is intentionally not included in VITA-E-PLUS 400 to guard against over supplementing with selenium.</P>
<P>  Most Vitamin E supplements are gelatin capsules containing oil.  Some of their Vitamin E is used up as an antioxidant protecting the oil. This is great for the oil, but it leaves less available for you. The natural d-alpha tocopherol succinate form of Vitamin E used in VITA-E-PLUS 400 is stable to oxidation, which ensures full potency. In addition, it is water soluble so it is more readily absorbed into the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   VITA-E-PLUS 400 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty   natural  concentrates  of  numerous   valuable phytonutrients from plants.   When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>
