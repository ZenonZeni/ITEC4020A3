Nissho Iwai to develop coal mines in Australia+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Nissho Iwai Corp., a major trading house, said Monday it will
develop a group of coal mines in Australia's New South Wales state,
with total output estimated to reach 10 million tons after the year
2000.
     Nissho Iwai has established a joint venture company with South
Korea's state-run electric power corporation, its largest steelmaker
Pohang Iron and Steel Co., and nine other South Korean firms as well
as with Coal Operations Australia Ltd. (COAL), a Sydney-based mining
company.
     The joint firm is 48% owned by the South Korean group, 42% by
COAL and 10% by Nissho Iwai.
     The joint company has obtained from the state government of New
South Wales the right to explore coal deposits at the Wyong coal
mine -- made up of a 190-square-kilometer northwestern area and a
60-sq.-km eastern area, Nissho Iwai said.  Total deposits are
estimated at 1.6 billion tons.
     It will also double annual coal production capacity at a group
of mines in Wallarah adjacent to the Wyong mine to 3 million tons by
1998 at a cost of 67 million Australian dollars, or about 5.1 billion
yen, it said.
     The joint firm will conduct a feasibility study for the Wyong
mine next year at a cost of 18 million Australian dollars, or about
1.4 billion yen, and intends to launch commercial production as early
as 1999, Nissho Iwai said.  Output is expected to top 6 million tons
after the year 2000.

Casio Computer to jointly make pagers in India+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Casio Computer Co. will set up a joint venture in India next
February with Japanese trading firm Mitsui and Co. and India's
Bharti Telecom Ltd. to manufacture and sell pagers in the country, a
Casio official said Monday.
     Casio Bharti Mobile Communications Ltd. will be established in
New Delhi with capital of 200 million rupees (about 630 million yen),
the official said.
     Casio will own a 51% stake in the company, while Bharti Telecom
will hold a 40% share and Mitsui the remaining 9%, he said.
     In fiscal 1996, the company hopes to sell around 26,000 pagers
valued at some 3 billion yen.  By fiscal 1996, production is targeted
at around 600,000 pagers a year, the official said.
     The paging service that began in India in May this year has
proved highly popular and the market there is expected to grow to
about 1.5 million pagers a year by fiscal 1996, he said.
     Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands and Motorola Inc. of
the United States have already begun local production in India, he
added.

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Dentifrice and synthetic detergent maker Lion Corp. will launch
a feasibility study in the Vietnamese market early next year, a
company official said Monday.

Asian mainland, and currently makes detergents and other products in
six Asian countries, including China, the official said.

Japan to provide food aid to N. Korea+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan plans to provide food aid to North Korea after consulting
with the United Nations and South Korea, a top government spokesman
said Monday.
     ''We cannot overlook a neighboring country's trouble,'' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference.
     He referred to a prediction recently released by a South Korean
government think tank that says North Korea will face its worst food
crisis ever around June or July next year.
     North Korea will see a grain supply shortfall of some 3.5
million tons, and there even is a possibility of people being
displaced and fleeing to neighboring countries, according to the
report.
     A U.N. report recently said that people in many parts of North
Korea are facing starvation.
     Floods this year devastated much of the country's farmland,
causing a serious food shortage.

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Shin Dai-Ichi Vinyl Corp. is planning to offer technology on
the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to Indonesia-based P.T.
Siam Maspion Polymers, a company official said Monday.
     The Japanese company was chosen from eight polyvinyl chloride
makers which bid to give technology to the firm, set up jointly by
Thai company Siam TPC Singapore and Indonesian firm P.T. Maspion, the
official said.
     Siam Maspion Polymers plans to construct a plant under the

     To be completed by the end of 1997 at a cost of around 60
million dollars, the plant will have an annual production capacity of
120,000 tons.
     Shin Dai-Ichi Vinyl is considering building a polyvinyl chloride
factory in Indonesia in the future, the company official said.
     The company was established in July from the integration of the
polyvinyl chloride departments of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Nippon Zeon
Co. and Tokuyama Corp.
     The Indonesian polyvivyl chloride market is predicted to expand
to 282,000 tons in 1995 and 422,000 tons in 2000 from 260,000 tons in
1994.

Star TV plans to enter the Japanese market+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Hong Kong's Satellite Television Asian Region Ltd. (Star TV)
plans to enter the Japanese market in April, industry sources said
Monday.
     The move comes after Japan's Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry earlier decided to allow international broadcasting via

hotels, schools and cable TV stations in Japan, the sources said.
     Star TV will begin broadcasting a program specially produced for
the market using the Japanese language, they said.
     Star TV began offering international broadcasting services via
satellite in 1991 to the Asian and Middle East countries, and
currently provides 24-hour news, sports and entertainment broadcasts
in English and other languages on five channels reaching more than 50
countries.
     The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) is broadcasting its programs
via satellite to other countries in the region as well.

Marubeni signs multimillion dlr power deal in Vietnam+

HANOI, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     An international consortium including Japan's Marubeni Corp.
has entered into a contract with the Vietnam Power Corp. to build a
286-megawatt gas turbine power plant in a southern province,
official media reported Monday.
     The daily Vietnam News said the contract for the 101 million
dollar turnkey project, to be funded by the World Bank, was signed on
Saturday.
     The consortium formed between Marubeni and the Swedish power
company ABB Generation beat eight other competitors, including
Mitsubishi Corp. with Itochu Corp., Mitsui and Co. with the Britain's
John Brown and Sumitomo Corp. with General Electric of the United
States.
     The project calls for construction of the Phu My 2 power plant
in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, 60 kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh
City.
     The plant, to be powered by natural gas tapped and transported
from fields off the Ba Ria-Vung Tau coast, will have two gas turbine
generators in the first phase, which are scheduled to become
operational by early 1997.
     In the second stage of the project, generating capacity will be
increased to 600 megawatts.
     The report said electricity demand in Vietnam is projected to
rise around 15% a year from now through the next 10 or 20 years.  It
said Vietnam plans to meet this demand by boosting generation to as
much as 26-29 billion kilowatt hours by 2010.

Seikosha to make time clocks in Thailand+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Seikosha Co. plans to begin making time clocks in Thailand next
summer to respond to strong demand in Southeast Asia, a company
spokesman said Tuesday.
     The company's subsidiary in Thailand, Seikosha (Thailand) Co.,
will produce about 15,000 time clocks worth some 300 million yen in
fiscal 1996, he said.
     It is the first time for a time clock manufacturer in Japan to
shift production overseas, he added.
     Seikosha of the Seiko group currently manufactures and markets
about 50,000 time clocks annually in Japan, with sales at around 1.5
billion yen.
     Roughly 90% of the products are ordinary time clocks and
Seikosha is planning to transfer production of all of these to its
Thailand subsidiary by the end of fiscal 1998, the spokesman said.
     In the future, it will be boosting production in Japan of
''intelligent'' time clocks that can be connected to personal
computers and hold information such as on workers' salaries, he said.

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Asahi Glass Co. is planning to boost its production of flat

Chiyoda to offer plan to develop Myanmar's 2nd city+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Chiyoda Corp. will propose a development plan for the city of
Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, a company official said
Tuesday.
     Under the plan, the plant engineering company will propose
about 60 projects with priority orders as well as infrastructure
improvement projects in a 150-page report submitted to city
authorities, the official said.
     The plan aims to develop Mandalay into a larger city with a
population of 3.5 million by 2020, almost three times its current
population, he said.
     The proposal includes construction of oil pipelines from the
Bay of Bengal to the central Myanmar city and improvement in the
network of roads between Mandalay and the neighboring Yunnan
Province of China, the official said.
     Chiyoda sent three experts to Mandalay for a preparatory study
in September and began to make the plan voluntarily, the official
said.
     Since then, Chiyoda has submitted to the city authorities
several interim reports on how to develop Mandalay according to the
authorities' requests, the official said.
     Chiyoda hopes to receive orders from the city government for the
pipeline and other related projects proposed in the plan, he said.

Foreign investment in Vietnam tops 18 bil. dlr mark+

HANOI, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Cumulative foreign direct investment in Vietnam up to 1995 has
exceeded the 18 billion dollar mark, a Vietnamese business daily
reported Tuesday.
     The Saigon Times Daily attributed the information to Ministry of
Planning and Investment sources.
     It said the 18 billion dollar mark was surpassed after a record
6.08 billion dollars was invested in Vietnam from the beginning of
the year up to Dec. 20.
     That 1995 figure is almost double the 3.5 billion dollars
invested in 1994.
     The report said the cumulative total, which includes a legal
capital of 9 billion dollars, has been invested since Jan. 1988, when
Vietnam first opened its economy to foreign investors.
     The report said Taiwan retained its lead with 3.01 billion
dollars worth of investments, while Japan rose up the ladder to
secure second place with 1.78 billion dollars.
     Closely trailing Japan were Hong Kong with 1.74 billion dollars
and Singapore with 1.73 billion dollars.
     Filling out the top 10 list were South Korea (1.48 billion
dollars), the British Virgin Islands (1.14 billion dollars), Malaysia
(840 million dollars), Australia (760 million dollars), the United
States (690 million dollars) and France (600 million dollars).

said.
     The plant's annual capacity will be raised to 100,000 kiloliters
by 1998 and to 200,000 kl by 2005 from the present 30,000 kl, the
company said.
     The agreement also calls for the joint venture to upgrade
production technology to produce beer for sale under the Suntory
label in the future, the company said.
     Total investment is estimated at 5 billion yen, it said.
     Suntory entered China's beer market in 1984 by setting up a
joint venture in Jiangsu Province.  The project, China Jiangsu
Suntory Food Co., has already emerged as the top beer company in the
province, the company said.
     The company said Shanghai Suntory Brewery will give Suntory an
overwhelming share of the beer market in the Shanghai area.
     The company said it has also agreed with Shanghai Maling Food
Co. to establish a joint soft drink venture.
     The new firm, Shanghai Suntory-Maling Foods Co., will start
producing Suntory-brand soft drinks in the fall of 1996.
     Initially, the new company will produce oolong tea and an orange
drink both in cans and heat-resistant PET bottles.
     It will mark the first appearance of heat-resistant PET bottled
soft drinks in the city, the company said.
     Annual sales are forecast at one million cases in fiscal 1997,
rising to 3.8 million cases by 2001, it said.

Japan unlikely to resume Iran yen loans by end of '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan is unlikely to lift a freeze on official loans to Iran
before the U.S. presidential election is over in November next year,
a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
     The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japan
cannot resume extension of its low-interest official credits unless
Iran tries more seriously to improve its relations with other
countries, especially the United States.
     The Japanese stance is apparently intended to ward off possible
criticism from abroad of its policy on Iran, which the U.S. and many
other countries view as a major backer of international terrorism.
     It is feared that Japan's resumption of yen-denominated lending
to Iran now would make U.S. policy toward Japan a major issue in the
presidential campaign and strain ties between Tokyo and Washington.
     At stake is the second installment of 48.5 billion yen in
Japan's yen credit package for the construction of a hydroelectric
power plant on the River Karun in southern Iran.
     Tokyo has suspended its provision of yen loans to Tehran since
May 1993, when it supplied 38.6 billion yen in the first installment
of finance for the project.

Philippines to cut tariffs on 155 products in '96+

MANILA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Philippines will lower import tariffs on some 155 products
next year as part of an accelerated program to create a free trade
market in Southeast Asia by 2003, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) documents said Tuesday.
     According to the documents, the 155 items are among 717 products
in Manila's temporary exclusion list to be included in the Common
Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme over the next five years.
     The CEPT is the vehicle for creating a free trade area within
the ASEAN region, home of the world's fastest growing economies.
     ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
     Throughout ASEAN, about 687 tariff lines will be lowered in
1996 and 2,496 others in the next four years.  Average tariff rates
will subsequently be brought down from 7.73% in 1996 to 4.03% by
2000 and 2.90% by 2003.
     ASEAN member economies vowed at the end of the fifth leaders'
summit in Bangkok on Dec. 15 to speed up the realization of an ASEAN
Free Trade Area even before the target date year of 2003 by
maximizing the number of items whose tariffs can be reduced to 0-5%
by the year 2000, as well as expanding the number of products whose
tariffs can be reduced to zero percent by the same year.

Beijing public transport facing 300% fare hike+

BEIJING, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Beijing subway riders will see a 300% rise in ticket prices
Jan. 1 as the municipal government aims to reduce rising public
transport subsidies and a heavily overburdened subway system, state
press reported Tuesday.
     Ticket prices will rise to 2 yuan (0.24 dollars) from the
present 0.5 yuan (0.06 dollars), while monthly passes will rise 120%
from the present 18 yuan (2.16 dollars) to 40 yuan (4.80 dollars),
the China Economic Times reported.
     The fare hikes are expected to help offset growing government
subsidies which amounted to 250 million yuan (30 million dollars) in
1994 and are expected to top 400 million yuan (48 million dollars)
for the current year, the paper said.
     Beijing's two-line 42-kilometer subway system has become
increasingly overcrowded as rapid urbanization has increased the
number of commuters and the growth in automobile traffic has snarled
the streets of the capital and rendered the once dependable public
bus system increasingly hit-and-miss.
     Bus tickets are expected to rise from an average 0.2 yuan to 0.5
yuan, it said.
     Last year, Beijing commuters made 530 million subway trips, and
the system's 180-people subway carriages were strained to as much as
50% beyond nominal capacity during peak hours, making travel
uncomfortable and dangerous.
     The Beijing government, fearful of worsening inflation, has
previously refused to approve the subway price hikes, leaving subway
managers no choice but to limit monthly passes and control ticket
sales during peak hours.

2 Toyota affiliates set up joint ventures in China+

NAGOYA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Two major affiliates of Toyota Motor Corp. announced Tuesday
the establishment of joint ventures with the affiliates of a major
Chinese carmaker to manufacture auto parts in Tianjin, southeast of
Beijing.
     The Chinese carmaker is Tianjin Automotive Industrial (Group)
Co., with which Toyota Motor is now negotiating to set up a joint
venture to produce passenger cars.
     Nippondenso Co., a major maker of electronic car parts, said it
has set up Tianjin Denso Engine Electrical Products Co., in
conjunction with Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Generator and
Starter Factory.
     The joint venture, capitalized at 1.66 billion yen, will be
owned 55% by Tianjin Internal Combustion and the remainder by
Nippondenso and the Toyota group's trading house, Toyota Tsusho
Corp., the company said.
     The new joint venture will produce starters and alternators for
use in automobiles to be made by Tianjin Automotive Industrial, it
said.
     In a related development, Toyoda Gosei Co. established Tianjin
Toyoda Gosei Automobile Hose Co. in conjunction with a Chinese
business partner that also belongs to the group of companies led by
Tianjin Automotive Industrial, the company said.
     The joint venture, capitalized at 384 million yen, is owned
64.4% by Toyoda Gosei, 5% by Toyota Tsusho and the remainder by the
Chinese partner.
     The joint venture will produce brake hoses for use in
automobiles to be built by Tianjin Automotive Industrial.
     If the Chinese government approves a Toyota application to set
up a joint venture with Tianjing Automotive Industrial, the two
Toyota affiliates want to supply parts to be made by their new joint
ventures to Toyota's own joint venture with Tianjin Automotive too,
the pair said.
     Toyota is offering to produce passenger car engines with Tianjin
Automotive Industrial in view of the possible Chinese partner's plan
to introduce a new car model, Toyota officials said.

IHI gets order to build 3 blast furnaces in Taiwan+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. (IHI) announced
Thursday it has signed a deal with a major Taiwanese steelmaker to
construct three blast furnaces in Taiwan for about 40 billion yen.
     The steelmaker, Taiwan Steel Co., plans to build the furnaces at
a new plant near the city of Tainan, southwestern Taiwan, which will
start up in the year 2000 with an annual steel production capacity of
7.5 million tons, the Japanese comprehensive heavy machinery maker
said.
     The construction of the first blast furnace will be completed by
the end of 1999, and the Taiwanese firm plans to start operations in
June 2000, IHI said.
     The other furnaces will begin working by June 2002, IHI said.
     Each of the three furnaces has an internal volume of 3,800 cubic
meters, it said.
     With the new plant, Taiwan Steel intends to increase its share
of the domestic market where imports, mostly from Japan and South
Korea, currently account for about half the market, an IHI official
said.

Sumitomo to take stake in Indonesian chemical maker+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Sumitomo Corp. said Thursday it will purchase 25 million
dollars worth of convertible bonds to be issued in January by an
Indonesian chemical maker belonging to the Salim group, the largest
financial group in Indonesia.
     The Japanese general trading house will convert the bonds into
stocks after the redemption term matures in four years, meaning it
will take some stake in the equity of the chemical maker, PT Sulfindo
Ajiusaha, a Sumitomo official said.
     Sumitomo will also buy the chemical maker's debentures of the
same amount in January, the official said.
     The Indonesian maker plans to issue in January 100 million
dollars worth of bonds, half of which are convertible bonds, in order
to double its chlorine production for polyvinyl chloride resin, he
said.
     The remaining half of the bonds will be purchased by the Salim
group, he said.
     Sumitomo and the Salim group earlier set up two joint ventures
in Indonesia to produce polyvinyl chloride resin, and chlorine to be
made at the facilities will be used in the resin production, the
official said.

Nissan to expand ties with S. Korea's Samsung Motor+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Nissan Motor Co. plans to exand its strategical ties with
Samsung Motor Inc. of South Korea to cover business cooperation in
the Asian market, officials of Japan's No. 2 automaker said Thursday.
     The proposed expansion calls for the partners to produce and
market passenger cars in each other's country, they said.
     Details of the business cooperation will be ironed out by the two
companies, they said.
     ''Cooperative relations will be strengthened to help Samsung
develop into a powerful friend,'' an executive of Nissan said.
     Possible capital cooperation is under study, said the
high-ranking official, who declined to be named.
     Under plans reviewed by Nissan, Pusan-headquartered Samsung will
market Nissan cars in South Korea under its own brand names while
Nissan will sell Samsung cars under the Nissan brand.
     Both partners will strengthen cooperation to produce cars
competitive in the respective countries, the officials said.
     The two companies will produce cars in Southeast Asia under a
burden-sharing scheme and cooperate in developing vehicles to boost
their productivity, they said.
     They also plan to standardize components and parts to be used
in their vehicles.
     Nissan has been providing technological assistance to Samsung
Motor in plant construction and production of components since April
last year.
     More than 100 Nissan officials now are assigned to assist the
South Korean automaker, which plans to start producing passenger cars
at a newly completed assembly plant in Pusan in January 1998, the
officials said.

foreign automakers has intensified in the fast-growing auto markets
in Southeast Asian countries.
     ''South Korean cars have great growth potential in Southeast
Asia as they are sold at prices nearly 20% below those of
their Japanese counterparts,'' an industry official said.
     Japanese automakers have taken a dominant share of the Asian
auto market but their hegemony has shown signs of declining in recent
years in the face of the strong yen and a powerful sales drive by
South Korean competitors, industry sources said.
     For instance, they said, the market share held by Japanese
makers in Thailand dropped from 90% to 68% in 1994 in
the face of rising competition from U.S., European and South Korean
rivals.
     Nissan lagged behind the forerunners there because the company
focused on expanding its markets in North America and Europe, they
said.
     Nissan will strengthen its partnership with Samsung in Southeast
Asia to catch up with its rivals there, a company official said.

4.3 mil. tourists visit Indonesia in '95+

JAKARTA, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     About 4.3 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia in 1995,
bringing in estimated revenues of 5.21 billion dollars, local
newspapers reported Thursday.
     ''The total number of foreign tourists entering Indonesia
through seven main gates as of December 1995 is estimated to have
reached 4.3 million,'' Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Minister
Joop Ave was quoted as saying Wednesday.
     Joop said the projected revenues represent an increase of 10.8%
from 4.7 billion dollars in 1994, though the number of tourist
arrivals rose only 7.3% from last year's level of slightly above
four million.
     According to a five-year development plan, the government
expected 4.5 million foreign tourists to visit Indonesia this year,
bringing revenues of at least 6 billion dollars.
     The number of tourist arrivals is projected to rise to between
five million and 5.4 million in 1996, bringing revenues of 6.91
billion dollars.
     Indonesia is targeting the tourist industry as a major foreign
exchange earner by 2005, when it expects to attract 11.1 million
visitors who will spend a total of 15 billion dollars in the country.
     The promotion of the country's tourist industry was hampered
early this year when the Japanese press reported that dozens of
Japanese tourists had become ill with cholera after returning from
the resort island of Bali.
     Japan, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Germany are major
sources of tourists for Indonesia.  In 1994 more than half of all
tourists, 56.83%, came from these five countries.

China aims to attract foreign investment in real estate+

BEIJING, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     China is trying to make its real estate sector more attractive
to foreigners, mainly in the area of low-cost, mass-market housing.
     There has been a boom in construction of office blocks, luxury
condominiums, villas and hotels in the past few years, mainly funded
by foreign investors seeking high profits through leasing or selling.
     But the government has now applied the brakes with a mixture of
the carrot and the stick to force foreign funds into sectors of
perceived greater need.
     It has issued new regulations lifting the previous exemption on
import duties and other taxes for materials and equipment brought in
from overseas for the construction of virtually any type of real
estate project.
     Currently, there are restrictions on the approval of land
available for such projects as well as a value-added tax for real
estate.
     A Circular on Strict Control of the Development of Luxury Real
Estate Projects was also introduced in late 1995 and the regulation
speaks for itself in indicating government determination to control
what it reckoned was the main reason the construction sector
overheated in the early 1990s, leading to runaway inflation.
     At the same time, foreign companies willing to cooperate with
the government in a massive urban renewal plan scheduled for the next
decade -- razing entire low-rise residential districts in many cities
and replacing them with high-rise apartment blocks -- will be given
preferential treatment as well as a guaranteed rate of return on
their investments.
     According to Minister of Construction Hou Jie, the government's
efforts to bring the real estate sector under tighter control are
beginning to pay off.
     In 1992, for example, investment in building construction
projects rose 117% over the previous year.  By 1994, growth had been
reduced to a 41.3%, and Hou anticipated an even lower increase this
year.
     ''There are four million urban families facing severe housing
problems.  The per capita urban housing space in at least half the
country is below the national average and 40 million square meters of
urban housing are dangerous and in urgent need of repair or
replacement,'' he said.
     Hou is trying to persuade potential foreign investors that the
development of low-cost housing, while yielding lower profits,
actually involves less risk and will represent the chief investment
trend in Chinese real estate in the foreseeable future.
     According to the minister, it takes one year to organize a
contract for a major hotel and at least three years to build it.  It
then takes eight or nine years to recover investments and reap
profits.
     On the other hand, the construction of an ordinary housing
project requires only six months for the entire cycle.  Two cycles
per year can be completed in south China but only one in north China
due to the inclement weather.
     ''The great demand for housing continues to offer foreign
investors excellent prospects for earning good returns.  Foreign
businesses investing in real estate can earn higher profits than the
current international level in developed countries,'' Hou said.
     ''Internationally, average profits for real estate range from 6
to 8%, with the rate in some countries dropping to 2%. In China,
average profit seldom falls below 30%,'' he said.
     Taking the lead in this area is the Shanghai municipal
government, which is counting on new preferential policies to help
overcome the resistance of foreign construction companies to becoming
involved in the city's ambitious urban housing redevelopment program.
     Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment will be limited to
15%, but the main sweetener is new policies designed to reduce the
risks and red tape involved in building cheap apartments for
residents forced out by urban projects.
     According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the
Shanghai municipal government, regulations allowing foreign
investment in domestic housing projects were actually issued at the
end of 1993 but did not find any takers.
     ''Potential investors were discouraged by the huge outlays for
demolition of old buildings, relocation of residents and the
provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out of
prospective profits,'' he said.
     Foreign developers also had to team up with local parties to buy
a plot of land for redevelopment, and also pay a transfer fee for the
rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.
     To overcome resistance, Huang said, ''We have come up with new
policies which we estimate will save overseas investors much of their
expense if they put their money into housing projects for domestic
sale rather than for overseas buyers.''
     The new approach, which applies to all foreign-invested projects
in areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses,
calls for the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese
partner in a joint venture, with the foreign side providing the
financing.
     The Shanghai municipal government has pledged to buy the entire
housing project when completed and be responsible for its eventual
sale.  The profits reaped by the foreign investor can be remitted
overseas free of the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.
     The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipal
authorities.  Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering a
similar package of financial incentives with a guaranteed return of
18%.

Cambodia counts on foreign funds for 45% of revenue+

PHNOM PENH, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Cambodia still depends on foreign aid and borrowings from
multilateral aid institutions for 45.1% of its budgeted revenue for
fiscal 1996 which begins April, according to the state budget
approved Thursday by the National Assembly.
     The parliament endorsed the government's overall budget proposal
totaling 1.45 trillion riels (5.66 million dollars) for fiscal 1996.
     The budget size represented an increase of 13.2% over a year
earlier.
     Although the budgetary dependency on foreign money declined
from the preceding year's 45.9%, the rate is still alarmingly high,
analysts say.
     In breaking down the budgeted expenditures in percentage terms,
defense accounted for the biggest chunk at 34.9%, down from the
preceding year's 38.9%.
     The budget for the Interior Ministry ranked second at 15.2%,
down from the preceding year's 16.8%.
     These defense and security expenditures shrank somewhat as the
security threat from the Khmer Rouge guerrillas eased.
     The Cambodian government budgeted a 111% increase in
tourism-related expenditures, a 65% increase in welfare outlays and
a 36% raise for royal family-related outlays.

Daiichi Pharmaceutical opens development unit in China+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. has established a wholly owned
clinical drug development subsidiary in Beijing, a Daiichi spokesman
said Friday.
     The subsidiary will conduct clinical tests of new, promising
drugs concurrently in both Japan and China.
     The subsidiary will enable Daiichi to move quickly in new areas,
giving it an advantage over its competitors, the spokesman said.
     He said the new subsidiary, Daiichi Pharmaceutical (China) Co.,
is capitalized at 5 million dollars.
     It will start clinical tests of the synthetic antibacterial drug
Cravit and the cerebral neurotransmission improvement drug Translon
at a Beijing hospital from March, the spokesman said.  Tests of other
drugs will begin gradually.
     Daiichi expects to obtain Chinese government approval for Cravit
and Translon in 1998, he said.
     The subsidiary will then establish a joint production and sales
company for the drugs with a local pharmaceutical firm, and Daiichi
will invest some 3 billion yen on facility construction, the
spokesman said.
     Daiichi aims to raise its annual sales in China to 10 billion
yen by 2000, he said.

Japan moves on economic sea zone could spark rows: paper+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The government is moving toward ratifying the international
ocean treaty and creating a 200-mile exclusive economic zone that
will likely inflame territorial disputes with China and South Korea,
the Tokyo Shimbun reported Friday.
     The daily said in a front-page article that the government hopes
to ratify the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea during the
upcoming regular Diet session and establish the exclusive economic
zone.
     The convention, which went into force in November last year,
obliges all signatories to recognize an exclusive 200-mile economic
zone off a nation's coasts.
     Within their zones, states have the exclusive right to fish or
to exploit natural resources such as oil, reclaim land or construct
artificial islands.
     In question will be Japan's dispute with China over the Senkaku
Islands, known in Chinese as the Diaoyutai Islands, in the East China
Sea.
     Tokyo also disputes South Korea's claim to Takeshima Island,
known as Tokto in Korea, in the Sea of Japan.
     The Senkaku Islands, located some 150 kilometers northeast of
the northern tip of Taiwan, are also claimed by Taipei.
     China has said it plans to ratify the sea convention next
summer.  South Korea has already ratified the treaty.
     Some Foreign Ministry officials said earlier this month Japan
should delineate a 200-mile zone with the Senkaku Islands as a
base of reference, arguing that refraining from doing so could be
interpreted by the Chinese as a lack of interest in the territory.

Japanese help Indonesian village improve iron casting+

URAWA, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The Japanese city of Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture, bordering
Tokyo, famous for its cast-iron pots and pans, is helping an
Indonesian village bring its metal-casting technology up to date by
introducing modern cupola furnaces.
     Six makers of cast-iron products in Kawaguchi have founded the
Kasia metal-casting technology exchange cooperative hoping to help
realize a model factory in Ceper, a village on Java, by the middle of
next year, said Kenichi Masuda, head of the cooperative.
     Because of the strong yen, the Kawaguchi makers have suffered
from sluggish demand, even for products made from new materials such
as ceramics.  They have embarked on the project in a bid to overcome
the mood of the recession, he said.
     The name ''Kasia'' is a contraction of Kawaguchi and Asia.
Ceper has some 300 metal casters who make their products in
hand-shaped sand molds.
     ''Their technological level equals that of Japan in the Edo
period (1615-1868), with rejects sometimes amounting to almost 80%
of production,'' Masuda said.
     The idea for the project was born when the head of a
metal-casting cooperative from Ceper requested technological
assistance after inspecting Masuda's factory during a visit to Japan
in 1991.
     The village is providing the site and the factory free of
charge.  Kawaguchi workers skilled in the latest metal-casting
techniques will serve as instructors at the Ceber model factory and
bring the know-how of some 20 local metalworkers up to date.
     Also planned are a library and a metal-casting contest.
     Indonesia relies heavily on imports for cast-iron products,
particularly machine parts.
     Japanese makers producing in Indonesia are not able to keep up
with demand.  Masuda, though, said he does not expect the model
factory to make profits right from the start.
     ''We are ready to live with a deficit in the first few years.
For us, the project is significant in giving new impetus to Japan's
metal-casting industry which is in a fix.''

Steelmakers face price-cut pressure for exports to Asia+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Japanese steelmakers are under growing pressure to cut prices
of Asia-bound steel products due to a glut in the market, steel
companies officials said Friday.
     They said China's restraint on economic expansion, including a
switch to a tight credit policy, is primarily responsible for the
glut.
     The Chinese government has ordered domestic steelmakers to limit
their production to reduce large inventories resulting from
overproduction in 1994, they said.
     China's crude steel output was estimated at 90 million tons in
1994.
     Japanese steel producers recently bowed to a Chinese demand for
a price cut of about 8.0% for their steel shipments in the
February-July period.
     The officials said Japanese steel companies already face growing
calls for price cuts from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.
     Prices of steel products bound for India and the Middle East
have also declined by about 10% from the July-September level of
this year.
     Trading houses said some Japanese steelmakers have offered
price cuts of up to 15% to secure export volume.

     Thailand will have 59.71 million -- 29.84 million males and
29.87 million females -- as of Jan. 1, 1996, according to the
quarterly Mahidol Population Gazette released by the institute.
     It said the urban and rural populations are now 18.86 million
and 40.85 million respectively.  Bangkok has 7.85 million people.

China to cut tariffs, spell out new rules+

BEIJING, Dec 29 Kyodo

     China will cut import tariffs on 4,000 items by an average 35%
beginning April 1, 1996, while preferential policies for foreign
investment projects already approved will enjoy a transition period,
state press reported Friday.
     In a bid to level the playing field among China's backward
inland regions and its booming special economic zones, and to offer
foreign enterprises the same treatment as domestic one, the State
Council has issued a circular calling for the reduction of the
general tariff rate to 23%.
     It also called for an end to the duty-free benefits enjoyed by
the special economic zones, the Economic Daily said.
     The circular conforms with the tariff cuts promised by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at the Osaka informal summit meeting of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in October and is seen
as a significant step toward China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
     No information was provided on the precise size of reductions or
which products would have their import duties cut.
     However, regulations were set out regarding a transition period
for preferential tax policies and duty-free benefits for foreign
investment projects legally approved before the publication of the
circular.
     Foreign investment projects worth more than 30 million dollars
and approved before Dec. 28 would continue to enjoy their reduced and
duty-free tariffs and preferential import taxes on imported equipment
and raw materials until Dec. 31, 1997, it said, while such projects
valued under 30 million dollars could extend the previous policy
until Dec. 31, 1996.
     Equipment for technological transformation approved for import
before the issuance of the circular would also continue to enjoy
previous preferential import policies during the transition period,
it said.
     If equipment and resources are not imported within the specified
transition periods, enterprises could ask the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation or the State Economic and Trade
Commission for an extension from the State Council, it said.

China breaks another grain output record in '95+

BEIJING, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Chinese farmers harvested a record 466 million tons of grain in
1995, up 21 million tons over last year and nearly 10 million tons
over the previous record harvest in 1993, Xinhua News Agency
reported Friday.
     The record output came, though several grain growing areas were
plagued by natural disaster during the year and rising costs for
fertilizer and pesticides threatened to keep farmers off the land.
     ''With the rise in grain prices mainly blamed for last year's
high inflation rate, the 1995 increase in output is a great help in
the nation's efforts at curbing inflation and easing the strained
grain market,'' analysts said, according to Xinhua.
     Government officials have set a grain production target of 500
million tons for the year 2000, as China's rising living standard is
expected to increase grain consumption, especially of feed grains.
     According to the Hong Kong-based China Agribusiness Review 1995,
following trends in the first half of the year, China is expected to
become a net grain importer this year after being a significant
exporter over the last two years.

Ramos signs 394.8 bil. peso budget for '96+

MANILA, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     President Fidel Ramos signed into law Friday a 394.8 billion
peso (about 15 billion U.S. dollar) budget for 1996, with education
getting the biggest chunk of the funds, presidential palace and
Congress officials announced.
     The budget also earmarked large outlays to public works,
defense and assistance to local governments, House Speaker Jose de
Venecia said.
     It also reflects a doubled budget for agriculture to help the
sector cope with the immediate effects of tariff and subsidy cuts
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and includes a 4
billion peso (about 15 million dollar) fund for poverty alleviation,
de Venecia said.
     The budget department said that while general appropriations
come to 394.8 billion pesos, the total obligatory budget approved by
Congress was 415.6 billion pesos (about 16 billion dollars),
including 25.3 billion pesos (97 million dollars) for automatic debt
service payments.
     Congress initially wanted to include debt-service funds in the
general appropriations, but Ramos vetoed the move, noting that the
Supreme Court has already ruled that funds for debt servicing are
automatically appropriated and need not be included in the yearly
budget.

Remitted funds from Asian contract workers top ODA+

MANILA, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The aggregate sum of remittances to home countries from
overseas contract workers from nine Asian countries has shot up to
dwarf the annual total of official development assistance (ODA) to
the nine, an Asian Development Bank investigation shows.
     Remittances from such workers to the nine countries totaled 75
billion dollars in 1993, exceeding their aggregate ODA of 54 billion
dollars from industrialized countries, including Japan, the survey
shows.
     The survey covered the Philippines, Thailand, India, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China and South Korea.
     In the Philippines and Indonesia, the ratio of contract workers'
annual remittances to the nations' gross domestic product (GDP) is on
the rise, according to figures collated by the Manila-based regional
lending institution.
     In a period from 1987 to 1993, the aggregate of remittances home
from Indonesian contract workers abroad quadrupled from 86 million
dollars to 346 million dollars, while that of Filipino workers showed
a 2.4-fold jump from 1.02 billion dollars to 2.54 million dollars,
the survey showed.
     In contrast, the aggregate home remittances from Thai and South
Korean workers saw much slower growth ratios over similar periods.
     Aggregate remittances from South Korean workers increased
nearly 50% from 418 million dollars to 605 million dollars from 1987
to 1993, while those from Thai workers grew 40% from 784 million
dollars to 1.13 billion dollars in a period from 1987 to 1992,
according to the bank figures.
     This could imply that a nation's dependence on such remittance
eases as its economy prospers, alleviating the need for contract
workers to go abroad and send money home, analysts said.
