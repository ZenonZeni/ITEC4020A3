  A national survey of 133 secondary vocational educators examined practices

respondents included a competency-based grading component, believed that 
student effort should be used to determine grades, and had never been involved 
in their students' Individualized Education Program development.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

inservice teacher preparation for grading; and (4) the developmental process of 
gradually changing grading practices.  (DB)<BR>

  Two studies of third- through sixth-grade low-achievers (N=83) and 26 third-
graders (some receiving special education services) compared traditional 
standardized achievement tests and alternative curriculum-based measures.  
Results indicated that curriculum-based measures were more sensitive in 
assessing student progress in reading and writing and related more consistently 
to a criterion measure of student growth.  (Author/CB)<BR>

  Grading Mainstreamed Handicapped Students. Position Paper.<BR>

  Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
  The position paper of the Grand Island, Nebraska, schools supports the 
assumption that when a pupil's handicap affects his ability to learn and 
perform, appropriate special education should include guidelines for special 
grading.  The paper identifies grading obstacles such as differing perceptions 
of various participants in the grading process.  Three grading philosophies 
(criterion-referenced, self-referenced, and norm-referenced) are explained.  
General grading practices (e.g., use of a multiple grading system to serve 
diverse functions) are recommended.  Also noted are grading practices for 
handicapped and remedial students grouped into categories based on standards, 
grading vehicles, or logistics.  Elements of the grading process supported by 
this paper include performance criteria, the grading decision, and reporting 
systems.  Physical, cognitive, emotional, and sensory handicapping factors are 
described as they relate to grading practices.  Problems that regular educators 
have with adjusting grading practices for handicapped pupils are noted.  Ten 
grading policy recommendations include grading by the subject teacher, 
designation of "alternative assignment" when adaptive grading is applied, 
reporting to parents in the form of a written progress report as well as a 
standard grade, and failure only in extreme and well-documented cases.  
Questions to help a teacher determine whether alternative grading is necessary 
for a mainstreamed student are offered.  A sample matrix of grading messages 
and receivers, a grading contract, a multicategory system of grading 
mainstreamed handicapped students, and a three-page reference list conclude the 
document.  (DB)<BR>

  Grading Handicapped Students in Vocational Education Programs.<BR>
  Squires, Sandra K.<BR>

  EDRS Price - MF01/PC01 Plus Postage.<BR>
  Language: English<BR>
  Document Type: NON-CLASSROOM MATERIAL (055)<BR>

  Journal Announcement: RIEFEB86<BR>
  Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
  The paper examines several basic grading procedures, noting the advantages 
and disadvantages of each procedure for handicapped students.  Eight 
alternatives to grading are mentioned; of these, four are considered: (1) 
contract grading, (2) pass-fail grading, (3) the mastery learning approach, and 
(4) written evaluations (including checklists).  It is suggested that a more 
appropriate approach than any of these commonly found practices must be worked 
out on a building level.  Samples of grading proposals are provided which may 
be useful to vocational teachers, including a pass-fail system based on 
competency achievement for a post-secondary program with suggested time 
parameters of 6, 9, and 12 months; a proposal combining grading with a 
weighting system; and a framework consisting of a set of assumptions and a 
single learner progress chart.  (CL)<BR>

  Contending that traditional grading practices victimize the mainstreamed 
handicapped student, this essay analyzes the uses of grades and recommends a 
flexible grading system based on the use of grades to assist mainstreamed 
students to achieve a sense of competence.  (MJL)<BR>
