SOUNDCARRIER GROWTH SLOWS DRAMATICALLY IN MAJOR MARKETS

Music & Copyright estimates that the combined sound-carrier sales of
the four largest markets in the world grew by only 6% in 1995. These
territories together represent almost two thirds of the world's
soundcarrier market.

However, apart from the decline of the MC format in all territories and
the recovery of the sale of singles outside the US, no overall pattern
emerges for the US, Japan, Germany and the UK. Japan and the UK
experienced double digit growth over the year, but there was little
growth in either the US or Germany. The table below shows Music &
Copyright's estimated individual growth rates for the world's top four
soundcarrier markets plus a combined growth rate for all four
territories weighted to account for the relative size of each market.

In 1994 there was a 16.5% increase in value of the world soundcarrier
market, according to record industry trade association IFPI. In the 30
national markets which represented over 90% of global soundcarrier
sales this fell to 14% in the first half of 1995 (see M&C 76/3). The
major cause of this was a decline in the growth of CD unit sales which
slowed down from 25% in 1994 to 19% for the first six months of 1995.
This decline continued into the second half of 1995.

According to US trade paper Billboard, SoundScan, which collects sales
data from music retailers, reported that 409.5m CDs and 245.7m MCs were
sold in the US in 1995. This represented a rise of 11.2% in CD sales
from 1994 and a 16.2% drop in MC sales.

Bearing in mind the higher price of CDs, in value terms, these figures
mean that the US market has hardly had any growth. Although the unit
figures of SoundScan and the US trade association RIAA are very
different, because one tracks sales and the other trade shipments,
their percentage figures for growth and decline have generally been
close.

Certainly SoundScan's percentage changes are close to the trade
shipments reported by the RIAA for the first half of 1995, which were
plus 13% for CDs and minus 15% for MCs. These contrast dramatically
with 1994 when the RIAA reported a 34% growth in CD trade shipments and
a 2% growth in MC shipments.

Moreover, US soundcarrier sales over the Christmas period,
traditionally the biggest sales period of the year, were flat.
According to SoundScan, unit sales were down 0.03% in December 1995
compared to the same period in 1994 and the growth rate for CD sales at
12.4% was lower than for the year as a whole. The International Council
of Shopping Centers, which tracks sales at 400 regional malls in the
US, reported that music and related home entertainment sales were down
0.3% on Christmas 1994 in contrast to a 4.7% rise in mall sales
generally.

Accordingly, most observers are predicting minimal growth in the value
of the US soundcarrier market in 1995. Some even predict that total
soundcarrier revenues will hardly top 1994's $11.84bn. They give two
main reasons: poor sales by superstar albums and increased competition
from computer software.

Although Hootie and the Blowfish sold an unprecedented 11m units of
their debut album Cracked View Mirror in the US, as a whole there were
fewer big-selling albums there in 1995 than in 1994. Only 278 albums
sold over 500,000 units each, compared with 340 titles in 1994. Among
the top acts whose albums did not meet expectations were Elton John,
Rod Stewart, Paula Abdul, the Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt and Michael
Jackson, whose HIStory only sold 2m units in the US.

In addition, video and computer games now compete for the dollars that
were traditionally spent on music. In the first half of 1995 software
sales grew by 12% (compared with 8% for soundcarriers) and in the last
quarter of 1995 several computer chains reported an average 40%
increase in sales of personal computers, with 30 of the US' 64 major
computer retailers reporting better than expected sales. Only 11
reported sales below expectations.

Soundcarrier sales in Japan totalled $5.43bn in 1994. Whereas there was
20% growth in the US soundcarrier market in 1994, sales grew by only 1%
in Japan that year. But sales of music in Japan grew by at least 10% in
1995. Western compilations were increasingly successful in Japan in
1995 (see M&C 79/3). CD titles of international repertoire manufactured
inside the country in the first 11 months of the year represented 39%
of the market, or 95.2m units. Shipments of international repertoire
grew by 19%, compared to 8% growth for domestic repertoire. However,
figures compiled by the Japanese trade association RIAJ, which show an
11% growth rate by value in the year to November, may underestimate the
situation. They do not include albums imported by Western-owned
retailers (such as Tower) and Japanese record companies, which
increased greatly in 1995. In the first six months CD imports rose 24%
by value to $193.4m and 40% by units to 32.7m (see M&C 74/6). Sales of
singles in Japan have also continued to rise. In the first 11 months of
1995 sales grew 22% in units and 18% in value.

Earlier in the year, observers predicted that Germany, which posted 3%
growth in value in 1994 and 12% growth in the first six months of 1995
according to IFPI, would have a 6% plus growth rate for 1995. However,
in the light of a disappointing summer, poor Christmas sales and fewer
major releases than expected, most have revised this figure downward.
The most dramatic fall in growth was of CD shipments, which fell to 7%
for the first nine months of 1995 after being in double figures
throughout the 1990s. In view of this and the 15% fall in MC shipments,
Music & Copyright estimates that in value terms the German soundcarrier
market will grow at between 1% and 2%. Taking account of inflation,
this figure represents hardly any growth at all in real terms (see
story on page 8 for more detail on the German soundcarrier market).

Huge Christmas sales, the continued revival of the singles market and
the Britpop phenomenon, which had a noticeable effect on album sales in
the second half of the year, combined to create double digit growth for
the UK soundcarrier market in 1995. Most observers predict the UK
market will grow by more in 1995 than the 17.4% increase seen in 1994
and the 18% growth reported for the first six months of 1995.

UK sales in the fourth quarter alone were over 20% higher than in the
same period of 1994. Almost 50m albums were sold, with just under 15m
sold in the two week Christmas holiday period. Of these sales some 2m
(or 4%) were accounted for by Robson & Jerome's eponymous debut album.
This was in addition to the sales of 2.8m copies of the duo's first two
singles. The Britpop effect can be seen in the Top 100 selling singles
of the year. In 1994, 39 of these were by British acts; in 1995, 49,
the highest ever number in the 1990s since 1991.

SHORTAGE OF SUPERSTARS BRINGS DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN CONCERT GROSSES

The value of concert tickets sold in North America fell by almost 33%
in 1995 to $950m, according to trade paper Pollstar. Nonetheless,
ticket sales in 1995 were the third largest in the history of the US
and Canadian concert industry. The top 50 grossing tours accounted for
78% of the total with combined ticket sales of $742.7m.

The two significant trends of 1995 were the decline in the number of
superstars touring and the emergence of a number of new headline acts.
In 1994 the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd together took $225m, which
was just over 16% of the $1.4bn raised by ticket sales in that year. In
1994-1995 the Eagles, whose Hell Freezes Over was the most successful
reunion tour ever, grossed $142.7m in total, of which $63.3m was earned
in 1995, representing almost 7% of the year's ticket sales.

However, few other superstar acts toured apart from R.E.M., Boyz II
Men, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page and the Grateful Dead. The Dead
cancelled their autumn tour following the death of group leader Jerry
Garcia and have since said they will no longer perform live.

Among the new acts who toured successfully were Hootie and the
Blowfish, who translated the 11m sales of their debut album Cracked
View Mirror into $8.8m in concert ticket sales. Other new acts which
grossed high figures on tour included the Dave Matthews Band ($9m from
130 shows), Jodeci and Mary J. Blige ($7.7m from 30 shows) and Phish
($15.7m from 79 shows). In the country field, Mary Chapin Carpenter and
John Michael Montgomery had large-grossing tours for the first time.

Several acts earned more from touring than their record sales might
have suggested. Among these were Page/Plant ($33.4m), Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers ($27.5m) and Elton John ($22.5m). More in line with their
record sales were the touring revenues of two country acts, Reba
McIntire ($27.4m) and George Strait ($15.2m). Strait's 49-show tour
helped his MCA box-set sell far better than expected.

Another reason for the decline in 1995 concert revenues was that acts
tended to play smaller venues. Whereas in 1994 three football stadiums
shared first place for mounting the biggest shows, no football stadiums
were among the leading venues of 1995. Similarly, whereas 17 concerts
grossed over $5m in 1994, none did in 1995.

However, as the table below shows, if 1994's exceptional figures are
excluded, the 1995 figures show a modest return to growth. This
moderate increase in ticket receipts is expected to continue into 1996.
U2 looks set to be the biggest tour of 1996, (although the group has
not yet announced dates). The Rolling Stones and the Eagles are
expected to continue their ongoing tours, but not in North America.
Bruce Springsteen's solo acoustic tour will probably include as many
bars as concert halls and accordingly will not be among the year's
largest grossing tours.

EMI MUSIC WINS RIGHTS TO LIFE FOR MRSE

UK Mechanical Collection Society MCPS has accepted EMI Music's claim
that the 10 works on Simply Red's Life album were not registered with
MCPS. This acceptance was reached at an MCPS board meeting before
Christmas and frees EMI Music to collect the phono-mechanical rights
due from Life directly from Simply Red's record company Warner Music
Europe. EMI Music intends to do this through Mechanical Rights Society
Europe (MRSE), a collection society it specifically set up for this
purpose (see M&C 80/5).

EMI says it wants to do this because of excessive delays in receiving
monies through the GEMA-Warner Music Europe central licensing deal and
the high rebate GEMA gives Warner. Prior to this, GEMA argued that the
works had entered the European copyright system through MCPS and that
EMI Music could not withdraw them. GEMA has now written to EMI Music
saying it accepts that the phono-mechanical rights in the works are
registered with MRSE.

Music & Copyright understands that EMI still intends to divide the
mechanical rights in the works between MRSE (phono-mechanical rights)
and MCPS (non phono-mechanical mechanical rights) which it expects GEMA
to collect on its behalf (see M&C 78/5). In response to the argument
that this will inevitably drive up the costs of rights collection,
because the revenues (roughly 20% of mechanical revenues) are more
costly to collect than phono-mechanicals, EMI points out that higher
commission rates for the various mechanical rights are already in
place. GEMA's response to this is as yet unknown.

However, there is growing evidence that despite having set up MRSE,
which had its inaugural board meeting two weeks ago, EMI is more
concerned to get GEMA to reduce its rebate and speed up payment than to
make extensive use of MRSE.

Music & Copyright understands that these were the main topics discussed
at a meeting between EMI Music and GEMA, the first between the leading
executives of both organisations, at London's Heathrow airport last
week. Although EMI Music says it has other projects that it is
considering putting through MRSE, including at least one act that
records for EMI Records, it seems far more interested in resolving the
problem within the existing operating structure of the European
collecting societies. A further meeting between GEMA and EMI Music is
scheduled to take place at MIDEM on January 22.

ITALIAN ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING FALLS 4%

Spending on entertainment in Italy in the first six months of 1995 fell
4.3% in real terms to L2,164bn ($1.37bn), according to Italian authors'
rights society SIAE. Because SIAE collects entertainment taxes on
behalf of the Italian government it is well placed to see changes and
developments in the amount of money spent on entertainment in Italy.

According to SIAE, for the first half of 1995 attendances at pop music
concerts and popular arts events rose 16% to 2.9m, although the total
number of events was almost unchanged at 8,300. Receipts rose 16.6% to
$40m and average ticket prices rose by 0.6% to $13.75. Receipts from
classical music concerts over the six month period rose 9.3% to $22.2m,
mostly because of higher ticket prices which rose to an average $10.75
each. Unit ticket sales only rose by 0.7% to 2.1m for 9,000 concerts, a
similar number to the first half of 1993.

There were 1,000 fewer cinema screenings over the period: down from
285,000 to 284,000. Ticket sale receipts dropped by 2.9% to $240m and
the number of cinema-goers fell by 7.1% to 44.3m. Average cinema ticket
prices rose from $5.18 to $5.42. Theatre fared better than most forms
of entertainment. Box office receipts totalled $105m, a 10.5% increase.
Average ticket prices rose by 3.5% to $11.40.

Spending on sport dropped by 7% to $229.5m, SIAE said, although
receipts rose by 4.6% to $141m. Over the six months a total of 7.1m
tickets were sold for top class football matches, an increase of 1.1%
over January-June 1994.

U2-PRS CASE NEAR SETTLEMENT

Irish group U2 has won at least part of its battle with European
collection societies to reduce the deductions made from performance
royalties and the speed of payment. French authors' society SACEM has
reached an agreement in principle with the group and its publishers.
SACEM has agreed to reduce its administration costs and the cultural
deductions it makes and to pay performance revenues within 28 days.

U2 issued a writ against UK authors' society PRS in February 1994 after
a two year dispute with the society over the methods of collecting and
distributing public performance royalties for songs performed on large-
scale international tours (see M&C 35/2). Music & Copyright estimates
the gross performance royalties earned by U2 on its 1992-1993 European
tour at a little over $1m. U2 said it received less than 50% of this
and wanted to establish a system whereby the group itself collected the
money, which is calculated as a percentage of gate receipts. When PRS
refused to give the group back its performance rights U2 issued a writ
demanding their return. Nine European collecting societies were co-
joined to the writ in June 1994 (see M&C 44/1). This was because the
group needed the return of rights from each national society in order
to negotiate fees with individual promoters in Europe.

As a result of the agreement with SACEM, the French society will be
dropped from the writ. If, as is expected, it is followed by similar
agreements with other continental societies, they too will be dropped
from the writ. However, before these agreements can be made, U2 and PRS
must formalise their arrangements. The two have resumed talks after a
considerable time and an announcement of a resolution of the matter is
expected at the MIDEM trade fair later this month.

UK COPYRIGHT GOES TO 70 YEARS PMA

The harmonisation of copyright legislation within Europe came a step
closer January 1 with the adoption in the UK of a law meeting the
European Union (EU) directive of October 29 1993 on the issue. Member
states had officially been required to bring the directive into force
by July 1 1995. The most dramatic effect of the harmonisation in the UK
is to end the disparity whereby copyright ended 50 years after the
author's death, 20 years less than the EU term. The law applies to all
composers from European Economic Area states, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Iceland, Ireland,
Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
the UK.

Publishers contacted by Music & Copyright had not seen the bill, which
was only finally published last week, so several key points, which the
EU directive left up to individual member states to decide, were still
unknown. A key issue is whether or not the bill stipulates reciprocity
with other non EEA countries, which would especially affect US authors.
The UK authors' society PRS thought an immediate rise in licensing
income unlikely since it issues blanket licenses to venues and
broadcasters. However some classical venues may now have to apply for a
licence. This would create extra income.

Publishers say that renegotiation of fees will have to take place with
broadcasters since some, notably Classic FM radio, currently pay PRS a
low fee because much or most of their output is out of copyright. Among
composers coming back into copyright will be Elgar, Holst and Arthur
Sullivan.

Among issues PRS would like to see clarified are third party rights,
for example the rights of the arrangers of works now returning to
copyright protection. Also at issue is how revenues will now be
collected globally, particularly from US collection societies, since
most US protection is for less than 70 years. Mechanical rights society
MCPS has provided members with notes to ascertain whether works are
covered by the EEA term or whether they revert to country of origin.

Identifying the works that have gone out of copyright will create
initial costs. Moreover UK publishers feel that, at first, the new
legislation will lead to only a small increase in their revenues.
However, they expect to eventually see a considerable increase in
income, both from copyright material coming back into copyright and
from existing copyright material, which will earn money for longer.

France is now the only main European market which has not introduced a
new law to comply with the directive. French authors' society SACEM
says legislation was not presented to parliament in time for January 1
and is scheduled to be enacted in the spring. French law has afforded
authors of musical works 70 years protection and neighbouring rights'
holders 50 years protection since January 1 1986. For several months it
has been remitting funds to European collection societies in other EU
states on a national basis. SACEM says that this was done after the
October 1993 Phil Collins ruling.

CHINA CLOSES SIX PIRATE CD FACTORIES

International record industry body IFPI has won two important successes
in the fight against piracy in China. Five CD plants have been closed
in south China and the trading licence of a further plant has been
withdrawn by the authorities. In a separate action, IFPI and 23 members
were awarded $800,000 in damages by a court in Shanghai, China. The
court declared that in 1993 Taiwanese Shi Hua-Lek had illegally
produced over 95,000 copies of 31 albums containing 306 sound
recordings. Shi was also fined $43,000, ordered to pay costs and pay
for a public apology in China Daily.

The fine is huge by Chinese standards, but nonetheless IFPI was only
awarded damages. In Taiwan following a successful High Court appeal Shi
was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. No criminal case has yet to
be brought against a copyright infringer in China, which with sales of
256m pirate units is the largest pirate market in the world.

The Chinese authorities have been generally more willing to bring civil
cases to court than to try to stop pirate production at source. From
this perspective the steps taken by the authorities in Hainan and
Guangdon provinces late in December are highly significant. They
ordered the stoppage of production at four CD plants - the Zhuhai
Jiwellian CD Production Company, the Chazhou Xinle Laser Disc Company,
the Chailing Sound Production Company and the Hainan Anmei Laser
Production Company - which were manufacturing pirate CDs, CD-ROMs and
pornographic video-CDs. They also withdrew another plant's trading
licence after complaints by IFPI and seized moulds and pressing
equipment from a sixth plant, whose senior management was also
arrested.

All six plants are currently under investigation and IFPI is reasonably
confident that within a month further plants will be identified as the
source of pirate and pornographic CDs and CD-derivatives. Despite this
action, IFPI has made no moves to re-open its office in Canton which it
closed after death threats against its staff (see M&C 80/4).

In a further move, China's State Copyright Bureau and Press and
Publication Administration issued a circular on December 7 requiring
that two inspectors from the State Copyright office be based at all 270
registered manufacturing plants of audio and visual products from the
beginning of 1996. The inspectors will check that a Source
Identification Code is present on all CDs pressed and that Title
Verification has been established. They will be paid from local
government funds and will be barred from receiving gifts in money or in
kind from the factories at which they are based. The move was welcomed
by US officials at a meeting on December 20.

In addition, a new consumer law in China is having some effect against
piracy. Under the terms of the law customers can return fake and pirate
goods to stores where they were bought and get back double the money
they paid if the store cannot prove the items are genuine. In turn the
store can get double what it paid from its supplier, which in turn can
get double what it paid the manufacturer. US trade officials have
welcomed the law, although they point out that it is less useful in
dealing with copyright piracy than with piracy of high fashion items.

These moves come just before the anniversary of the Memorandum of
Understanding, signed last February between China and the US, which set
out a detailed timetable for China to introduce measures of
intellectual copyright protection. But, since signing the Memorandum,
China has made no significant progress in intellectual property
protection. New talks between the US and Chinese authorities are due
soon.

Commentary: PolyGram was the market leader in both album and singles
chart shares in Europe in 1995, according to European trade paper Music
& Media. The table above shows that PolyGram had a 20.7% share of Music
& Media's European Top 100 album charts and a 25% share of its
Eurochart Hot 100 singles chart.

PolyGram's success came despite the fact that its most successful album
label, Mercury, was only the fourth most successful with a 4.9% chart
share. The most successful labels were Columbia (8.1%), EMI (5.15%) and
Virgin (4.9%). Similarly PolyGram's most successful single label, A&M,
was only the ninth most successful label with a 2.5% share. The leading
singles labels were Virgin (5%), RCA (3.8%) and Iceberg (3.5%).

PolyGram's most successful album acts were The Cranberries, whose
Island album No Need To Argue accounted for 4.2% of the company's chart
share, and Bon Jovi whose Mercury album Cross Road was the third best
selling album in Europe. The greatest successes of second place Sony
were Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, French singing
Francis Cabrel and Michael Jackson. Because the figures are only
calculated from the first 48 weeks of the year, third-placed EMI's
share does not include most of the chart points due from The Beatles
Anthology and Queen's Made In Heaven. If they were included EMI would
probably be in second place. The company's most successful acts were
Pink Floyd and Simple Minds.

Sony had the most successful single of the year, Michael Jackson's You
Are Not Alone, but was only the fourth-placed company. Second to
PolyGram was EMI with hits from Shaggy, Meat Loaf, The Connells and
Edwyn Collins. Almost a third of the chart points of third-placed BMG
came from the two hit singles of Scatman John and Take That's Back For
Good.

In 1994 a number of mainland European acts such as Eros Ramazzotti,
Snap and Patrick Bruel had European-wide hits. In 1995 there were fewer
such acts. Only Danish-based Scatman John and the Dutch-based Rednex
had any significant European success.

The figures in brackets are the percentage changes on the corresponding
period in the previous year.

The value figure for Canada is wholesale; for Japan retail.

Commentary: Shipments of all soundcarrier formats in Canada apart from
CDs were lower in November than in the same month of 1994. This is
hardly any better than the situation in October 1995 when shipments of
all formats were lower than in October 1994. Despite these poor
results, the year-to-date shows the value of the market was 11% above
that in the comparable period in 1994. However the unit growth is far
lower at 4%. For additional comment see story on page 1.

SLOWER GROWTH IN 1995 FOR THE GERMAN SOUNDCARRIER MARKET

An unusually hot summer, a dearth of major releases and a disappointing
Christmas depressed soundcarrier sales in Germany in 1995. Early
industry estimates of a 6% growth rate have been revised downwards to
nearer 2% growth in value terms, but taking account of inflation, this
represents a stalling of the soundcarrier market in real terms. Total
record sales in 1994 were valued at DM5.68bn ($3.95bn). Of this 83%
came from BPW affiliated companies, 8.5% from non-members, 6.5% from
direct imports, and 2% from pirate product.

Figures from BPW, the German record industry's trade association,
showed a continued decline in cassette and vinyl sales and a 7%
increase in CD sales for the first nine months of 1995 compared with
the same period in 1994. However, the increase in the number of CDs
sold is unlikely to translate into the same growth in value because
many of the year's best selling albums were special offer compilations.

Unit sales of MCs and vinyl LPs fell by 15.4% and 40% respectively in
the first three quarters of 1995, continuing the trend of the last
three years. Growth in the singles market also slowed. Although sales
of CD singles continued to grow, up 9.3% to 30.6m units in the first
nine months of the year, (compensating for the 41.7% decline in vinyl
single sales to 700,000 units over the same period), January-September
unit sales growth in singles was of 7.2%, compared with 15% in the same
period in 1994. Overall, soundcarrier unit growth to end September was
3.2%. There was mounting industry concern that the CD singles market
was growing at the expense of CD albums, since many CD singles contain
as many as six tracks. A maxi-single typically retails at just under $9
compared with a long play format CD at around $21 or more.

The Virgin-McDonald's CDs

Soundcarrier sales in July and August were down 17% from the same
months in 1994, blamed largely on the long hot spell, which affected
most of Europe. Full 1995 sales figures have not yet been compiled by
BPW, but after the summer lull sales fluctuated considerably. September
was a good month, largely because of sales of the Virgin-produced Rock
Superstars Vol. 1 compilation. This was marketed through McDonald's
outlets at just $6.92 and sold 2.7m units in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland. Sales in October were up 10% compared with the same month
of 1994, but then rose only 3% in November, despite key releases such
as the Beatles Anthology and new product from Queen and the Kelly
Family.

December saw the release of Rock Superstars Vol. 2, again marketed
through McDonald's, this time with a $3.5m advertising campaign. The 14-
track album sold virtually the same number of units as Vol. 1 at the
same price. Market research showed one in six buyers of the first
compilation had never bought a soundcarrier before and that of those
first-time buyers, half made a second CD purchase before the end of the
year. World of Music, Germany's largest music retailer, reported a
lacklustre Christmas; December sales, which normally account for 18% of
annual turnover, were only 16% and only four albums were big sellers:
Queen's Made in Heaven, Michael Jackson's HIStory, Beatles Anthology
and Pur's Abenteuerland. Sales of this last were 50% below Queen's.

If, as expected, the final figures show that album market unit sales
rose by 3% in unit terms to about 211m units in 1995, the two Virgin
compilations will represent almost 2.4% of album sales overall and
almost 3% of all CD sales in the year, although less in value terms
because of their low price. Other budget CDs also contributed to unit
sales increases, according to IFPI members' reports of sales to clubs
and dealers. Budget CD sales rose 22.3% in the first nine months of the
year, while full price CDs rose only 5.7%. Unusually, sales of mid-
price CDs, which had a boom year in 1994, were down by 3.2%. Industry
observers blame discounting on full price CDs by retailers for this.

There was big growth in sales of German-language repertoire in 1995.
The country's November album chart showed an unprecedented seven albums
by German artists in the Top 10, and sales of domestic repertoire sales
rose an estimated 11% to account for 40% of the market, a record high.
Domestic repertoire achieved a 24% share of the year's Top 100 album
charts, and a record 41.3% in the singles chart. Albums by German
artists such as Pur, Die Doofen, Die Prinzen, Die Fantastichen, Die
Artzte and Westernhagen all performed well.

The continued growth of German repertoire

Consumers and radio stations are abandoning their bias towards Anglo-
American repertoire, say industry observers. This and the continued
strength of the dance and Techno genres has also helped boost domestic
repertoire's share of the market - reflected most strongly in the
singles chart. The independents' share of the singles chart rose from
16.8% in 1994 to 18.3% in 1995. The most successful independent was
dance label ZYX with a 10.2% share. Other successful independents were
edel (5.1%) EAMS (1.5%) and Semaphore (1%). The independents' share of
the album charts also rose, from 8.9% in 1994 to 10.5%. Independents
who had over a 1% chart share were edel (3%), ZYX (2%), Semaphore
(1.2%), SPV (1%) and Rough Trade (1%).

The VIVA music TV channel, which plays 40% German repertoire,
contributed to the increase in singles sales by German artists. In
April 1995 the company launched a second channel aimed at older
viewers, but playing a similar percentage of German repertoire. The two
channels have a combined reach of 21m people in Germany via cable and
satellite and another 3.5m in Switzerland and Austria, as well as
viewers elsewhere in Europe under the Eutelsat footprint (see M&C
75/12). As a result of VIVA's success, MTV has increased the amount of
German repertoire it broadcasts. In addition a new channel, COM-TV, is
due to start soon. It says it will cater for the 30-55 age group,
broadcasting German Schlager, folk, jazz and soul music. The channel
could further exposure given to domestic repertoire.

Sales of classical repertoire fell steeply by 10% in the first nine
months of the year, with no indications of an improved performance in
the last quarter. As a result, classical repertoire's 1995 market share
is predicted to be well below 1994's 9.6% by value and 10.5% by unit
sales. Catalogue sales have fallen significantly as the classical
market is now. like the pop and rock markets, primarily artist-driven.
At the same time the process of vinyl replacement has virtually ended,
local industry specialists say. In addition, low price and budget
material now represents a larger section of the classical market.

Compilations were another key feature of the German album market in
1995, representing 22.7% of the album charts Top 100 over the year.
Sales of compilation albums were up 8.3% in the first 10 months of
1995, with 27.5m units shipped. But local industry executives are
starting to question the value of the costly television campaigns
employed to market these compilation albums.

The majors in Germany

The major labels all have offices in Germany, except for MCA which is
still distributed by BMG. A company breakdown by album chart share (see
page 8) shows EMI as market leader, in 1995, despite dropping 2.3% from
1994. EMI had a strong showing late in the year with two albums by the
Kelly Family, two by Herbert Groenemeyer, as well as product by The
Beatles, Queen, the Rolling Stones, Roxette and Meat Loaf in the album
charts Top 20.

PolyGram closed in on EMI in second place, raising its album market
share 2.1% points to 20%. BMG was stable at 16.6%, followed by an
improved Warner at 16.1% and Sony showing a 2.2% drop to an album
market share of just 13.7%.

German retailing

Retailing continues to be dominated by department and chain stores,
where 40% of all soundcarriers are sold. Media Market and ProMarkt are
the biggest chains and the most aggressive price discounters, a trend
which continued to increase in 1995. A discounted/loss leader album can
retail for as little as $5.56 compared with the standard retail price
of $24.34. But there have been talks between the record industry and
the chains and some observers believe that aggressive discounting may
soon be a thing of the past. The success of these chains has led to a
sharp reduction in the number of independent music retailers over the
past decade.

Wholesalers, including rack jobbers, are responsible for 38% of all
soundcarriers sold, direct mail 17% and other outlets 5%. Industry
observers say there are too many wholesalers operating in Germany, and
that many of these are not really wholesalers but exist only to service
their own outlets.

Among speciality music retailers, the 19-strong German-owned WOM chain
is still leader. The Saturn chain is its main competitor. WOM had an
estimated 1995 turnover of $130m (87% of that from CD sales, see table
opposite), a rise of 3.8% on 1994.

Otherwise successful non-German competitors have failed in Germany.
These include French retailer FNAC and Virgin, which closed its last
German store in August. Foreign retailers blame strict laws on opening
hours, high costs and problems with suppliers for their lack of success
in Germany.

Nevertheless, HMV still plans to open a 1,500 square meter store near
Dusseldorf in September 1996. German retail outlets may open only
between 9 am and 6:30 pm on weekdays (until 8:30 pm on Thursdays) and
must close at 2 pm on Saturdays, except the first Saturday of the month
when they can stay open until 6 pm. No Sunday opening is permitted. A
change in the law on Sunday opening is not foreseen, but the record
industry is optimistic a proposed relaxation of opening hours, due to
be approved later this year, will benefit soundcarrier sales.

CD player ownership has continued to rise. The number of households
with one CD player or more (saturation rate) rose to 59% in 1995 with a
penetration level (number of players per hundred households) of 78%.
Video recorder saturation is 66%. It is estimated that only one
household in 250 has either a MiniDisc or DCC player. However, an
estimated 50% of the German population never buys a record of any type.

The video market

The video rental and sell through market is still growing in Germany,
with sell-through revenues outpacing rental for the first time in 1993
and reaching $661m in 1994. Sell through revenues are expected to have
reached $696m in 1995, with the rental market growing 6% after a fall
in 1994. According to European Video Review, there are 6,400 outlets in
all for purchase or rental of video tapes in Germany, 3,000 of them
supplied by rack-jobber MedienPlus. As with audio retailing, the
sector's growth is hampered by Germany's strict opening hours and the
lack of speciality multiples.

A new higher tax on receipts from touring could be backdated six years
and managers of top international acts have already protested against
the move and threatened not to tour in Germany as a result. One British
concert promoter estimated his backdated tax bill could reach $1.6m.
High grossing acts such as U2 and Dire Straits would be among the most
seriously affected by the new tax. UK managers, accountants and
promoters met in December and formed a six-strong steering committee to
lobby for the decision to be reversed. They hope to meet with Germany's
finance minister to discuss the issue.

Following the incorporation of the European Union's cable and satellite
directives into German copyright law, which was effective from, January
1 1996, the country now enjoys one of the world's highest levels of
intellectual property protection. Directives regarding rental, and
duration of protection for producers, increased from 25 to 50 years,
came into force July 1 1995, with a one year retroactive provision.
This effectively ended the trade in unauthorised compilations by the
likes of Elvis Presley and the Beatles.

Germany had 600 CD rental shops as well as 2,000 video rental shops
which also rented some CDs before the new legislation was introduced.
The new law affords producers and companies the exclusive right to
sanction or prohibit rental. To date none has given approval for the
rental of their recordings. Rental CDs typically featured chart
repertoire and usually were rented out at $1.50 a time. An estimated
90% of them were taped.

Currency fluctuations and price differentials sparked an increase in
parallel imports to Germany in 1995. Most of the product came from
Sweden, because the value of the Swedish Krona fell steeply against the
Deutschmark, and also from Britain and Italy. Industry estimates
suggested the retail value of parallel imports could be over $140m in
1995, up from $125m the previous year.

Piracy

Piracy rates continued to fall, however, mostly due to the effective
enforcement of a new copyright law in Poland, which had long been a
major source of pirate product. Improved co-operation between Polish
and German customs officials has also helped stem the flow of
counterfeit material from eastern Europe. However, pirate material
continues to filter in from Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech and Slovak
republics and even Kazakhstan. The pirate market was worth an estimated
$97m in 1994, down from $153m in 1993. It is expected to drop again in
1995.

Until recently a so-called "protection gap" existed in German law,
whereby bootlegs of concerts by EU citizens were allowed to be sold in
Germany if they were recorded in countries which were not signatories
of the Rome convention - notably the US. This loophole was all but
eliminated by a European Court ruling in a case involving Phil Collins,
which immediately took hundreds of thousands of bootleg CDs out of
circulation. The protection gap was finally closed on January 1 1996
with the harmonisation of EU member states' copyright legislation.

LA CIENEGA RULING RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS OF US COPYRIGHT

On October 12 1995 the American songwriting and music publishing
community received the troubling news that the US Supreme Court had
declined to review the La Cienega Music vs ZZ Top case. The US High
Court's refusal to hear the case has left undisturbed the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals ruling, which earlier this year placed a cloud over
the copyright status of virtually every musical composition released on
a phono-record in the US prior to January 1 1978.

The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) and other American
songwriter and music publisher groups are currently spearheading the
effort to convince Congress to revise the US Copyright Act in order to
thwart the potentially disastrous effects of La Cienega. However, until
Congress acts, it will be very difficult for copyright owners and
proprietors to be sure of the viability of their pre-1978 music
copyrights, or to enforce their rights in such works through litigation
within the Ninth Circuit (which includes the state of California)
without placing such copyrights at risk.

In order to understand the full implications of La Cienega some
background information on a rather esoteric area of US Copyright Law is
necessary. Many aspects of copyright protection for works created prior
to January 1 1978 remain subject to the "old" US Copyright Act of 1909.
That act did not state with clarity whether the distribution of a
phonorecord would constitute publication of the musical work embodied
in that phonorecord. However, the music industry came to rely on the
interpretation of the US Copyright Office that such distribution did
not constitute publication. This view was confirmed by the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in New York in the case of Rosette vs
Rainbow Record Mfg Corp (1976).

For close to twenty years, therefore, it has been considered as a
settled issue in the US that musical works distributed on phonorecords
prior to January 1 1978 were not thereby published. Thus, no copyright
notice for the musical composition embodied in each phonorecord was
required and no renewal of the musical work 28 years following such
first distribution of phonorecords was necessary in order to keep the
work out of the public domain.

The court in La Cienega however, reached the opposite conclusion. The
case involved rock band ZZ Top in a copyright infringement action
brought by the copyright owner of La Cienega Music regarding John Lee
Hooker's composition Boogie Chillin. The court found that Hooker's song
was in the public domain, having been published upon its first release
on phonorecord in the late 1940s - "published" being the key word here.
Under the 1909 Act, the court said, copyright in the work had to be
renewed 28 years later in order to preserve protection. Even if such
renewal had been properly filed, the court went on to say, the absence
of copyright notice for Boogie Chillin on the phonorecords had likely
placed the work into the public domain anyway. Such copyright notice
was virtually never included on phonorecords.

The effect of the Ninth Circuit's decision could be to decimate the
music community in the US. If left in place, the decision threatens to
bring chaos to the industry, throwing doubt on the holdings of music
publishers and threatening the rights of the authors of works published
before 1978. Already there is evidence that some copyright users may be
attempting to use the decision as an excuse not to pay royalties on
such compositions, under the presumption that the copyright owner will
not risk exposing the copyright through litigation to a finding that it
has fallen into the public domain. The failure of Congress to intervene
could easily spell disaster for thousands of songwriters and music
publishers in the US, and for their foreign counterparts whose works
have been embraced by the American public.

NMPA has made the overturning of this precedent its most important
legislative goal this year. While the American music publishing
industry supports wholeheartedly legislation currently pending before
Congress to extend the term of US copyright protection, and opposes
vehemently legislation which would unfairly diminish US performing
rights royalties for musical compositions, the preservation of
copyright protection itself on thousands upon thousands of pre-1978
compositions must command all our energies. We are both hopeful and
confident that supporters of intellectual property rights in Congress
will act in a timely manner to cut off the potentially devastating
effects of the Ninth Circuit's decision in La Cienega before they have
a chance to take hold.

DUTCH MEDIA COMPANY WEGENER BUYS ARCADE

Dutch media publisher Wegener is to take over Netherlands' independent
record and media company Arcade. Wegener is paying around Fl400m
($186m) for Arcade. The deal should be concluded by late January,
effectively retroactive to January 1, 1996. The merged company will be
called Wegener Arcade.

Arcade is one of the world's last remaining major independent record
label groups. It is second only to PolyGram in the Dutch market, has
about a 1% market share in Germany and a 7% share of the compilation
market in France. Wegener is a publishing group with expanding
interests in electronic media. The company expects 1995 earnings of
$596.5m and a 15% increase in net profits to about $37m.

After the merger, Arcade's current activities will be grouped into a
division called Arcade Entertainment Group, which will be managed by
Arcade's current president H Heinsbroek. At present Arcade comprises
four main divisions: music, media, retail and film/video and employs
700 people. Arcade revenues in the 1994/95 fiscal year to March 31 were
$247.3m, with net profits of $10.5m.

The Arcade Music Company (AMC) has three divisions, the record company
CNR Music, the classical label Vanguard Classics and the Arcade TV
marketing company. CNR Music was set up in the 1940s and owns the
world's largest Dutch-language catalogue as well as representing
artists such as Barry White, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Commodores and
Depeche Mode in the Netherlands. Vanguard Classics represents artists
including Alfred Brendel and Arno Bornkamp and is the largest
independent classical label in the Netherlands. Arcade TV has marketed
compilations in Europe for 20 years.

AMC has offices in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
Germany, Austria and France. It expects to open an office in Finland
this year and is in talks with an Italian company about forming a joint
venture. Arcade signed the first central European licensing agreement
involving an independent label with Dutch authors' society STEMRA
effective July 1 1995. The three year deal covered the sale of
international repertoire from the group's labels on MC and CD.

The Arcade Media Group (AMG) is the largest commercial radio group in
the Netherlands. It includes three radio stations, two commercial
television stations, the cable channel TV 10 Gold, which shows mainly
American and British programmes, and the 24-hour Music Factory channel,
currently available to 3m homes. AMG also publishes four magazines
linked to the radio and television stations and to Arcade's record
shops.

The Arcade Retail Group consists of two wholesalers and the Music Store
chain of over 70 record shops in the Netherlands, which aims to expand
to 100 outlets within two years. The Arcade Film & Video division was
set up after the group bought CNR Film & Video and exists to exploit
films through all media. It currently has offices in the Netherlands
and Belgium and aims to expand via AMC's network of offices.

IFPI AND FIMI LINK TO FIGHT PIRACY IN ITALY

International Record Producers' Association IFPI is to mount a new
campaign against soundcarrier piracy in Italy together with the local
trade association FIMI.

Music & Copyright estimates the value of pirate product sold in Italy
was equivalent to 27% of the legitimate market in 1994. Pirate sales
rose that year by 38% to $142.2m, according to IFPI. Sales of pirate
MCs rose by 15% and sales of pirate CDs rose by 150% from 1993. Pirate
product represented 32% of the market in unit terms. Because of this
high level of piracy, IFPI estimates that record companies are losing
nearly $150m a year.

IFPI says that Italy accounts for 44% of the 47m pirate recordings in
the European Union (EU) and that Italy exported 15m bootleg CDs in
1994. According to IFPI, half of all MCs, which account for a third of
all recordings sold in Italy, are illegal copies. This seriously
affects Italian artists because 60% of all cassettes sold are of
Italian repertoire. IFPI says 20% of CDs sold in Italy are pirated.
These figures make Italy the fifth largest pirate music market in the
world.

IFPI argues that the high level of piracy has meant that companies have
not invested in their Italian operations. In 1991 Italy's share of
legitimate sales in the EU was 7%. This had fallen to 5% in 1994. The
growth of the Italian soundcarrier market has also been dramatically
affected by piracy. Between 1991 and 1994 the legitimate market shrank
by 20% to $535m, whereas legitimate sales rose 9% over the same period
in the rest of the EU.

IFPI and FIMI will open the offices of their new anti-piracy operation
Federation Against Music Piracy (FPM) in Milan later this month. IFPI
and FIMI and the six major record companies are to spend $1m on the
anti-piracy office. FPM aims to improve law enforcement in Italy. IFPI
points out, for example, that no convictions are expected in five cases
it began in 1994 until 1999 at the earliest. Similarly, a January 1995
change in the law, which closed a loophole and criminalised illegal
recordings of live performances, is ineffective unless authors' groups
use their legal rights to secure a long term bans on the licensing in
Italy of such recordings. FPM will help them do this.

FPM will also improve information gathering about the trade in
counterfeit and bootleg product in Italy. It is thought organised crime
is involved and that most of the pirate market is in the south of the
country with only 26% in the north. Naples is thought to be the centre
of the trade and the entry point for material from North Africa and
eastern Europe.

IFPI cites the example of Spain as evidence that anti-piracy campaigns
can work. In 1984 the piracy rate in Spain was 34%. This fell to 5% by
1989 after a concerted campaign and stronger copyright legislation, and
by 1995 piracy had been virtually eliminated.
