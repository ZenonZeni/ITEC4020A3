This image compares a computer simulation (top) with observations (bottom) of Pacific Ocean sea levels during December 1994. The colors show the sea level relative to a 2-year mean averaged over 1993 - 1994: magenta indicates 15 centimeters lower than average and red 15 centimeters higher than average. El Nino caused the excessive heat (red and yellow) associated with the high sea levels in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. The rise of tropical air and formation of rainclouds contributed to the severe weather and heavy rains in California during winter 1995.

This comparison shows that the model underestimated the magnitude of oceanic features during this El Nino event. Using TOPEX/Poseidon data, scientists are working to improve the performance of such models, with the goals of reliably predicting future climatic events.

<h2>Oceanic Kelvin & Rossby Waves</h2>

This sequence of 3 TOPEX/Poseidon "snapshots" show sea surface height data in the Pacific Ocean. White and red indicated higher than average levels; purple and magenta indicate lower than average levels. These scenes show <i>eastward-moving </i> Kelvin waves and<i>westward-moving </i> Rossby waves. Superimposed black circles show how the elevated sea surface moves east in April (top), then west as Rossby waves during July (middle) and December (bottom).</font>

The 2 small black circles off the coast of the Americas correspond to sea level highs on the trailing edge of Kelvin waves. The leading edge of this wave group has bounced off the coastline, creating Rossby waves whose rising and falling sea levels are marked by solid and dashed lines, respectively.</TD></font>

In the July image, the circles are moving west with the Rossby waves. The "X" marks a relative sea level low caused by a Kelvin wave moving east.</TD></font>

In December, the Rossby waves continue to move westward. The shapes of the solid and dashed lines indicate that the Rossby waves are moving away from the Americas faster at the equator than at higher latitudes.</TD></font>
