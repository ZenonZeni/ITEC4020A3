<PRE>
In this dept I try to show you the many ways that we can help our
environmental cleanup while encouraging new approaches to age old
problems. By following the simple formula above , every can contribute their
share to the recovery of the earth.

<STRONG><H2>Reduce</H2></STRONG>
This is a simple way of say we can do just a well with less then we
think. We don't have to lower the quality of a our lives when we
reduce. There are many things that we can use less of while increasing
those things we need more of. The lesson here is keeping balance in an
ever changing world.

<STRONG><H2>Reuse</H2></STRONG>
There are many things that can be reused. Many things inded. So
manyinfact to mention here. Just look around your home. How many things
do you see that you don't haveto throw away but can reuse instead? Much
more then you realize. Also to reuse can also mean let some one else
reuse what you have? Pass it along. From TV to Cars from shirts to
pants. Pass it along to a friend or someone in need.

<STRONG><H2>Recycle</H2></STRONG>
OK so we know what this means , good for you. So now recycle! More and
more cities are being forsed to look at how they deal with these issues
and they are forced to implement new rules and regulations to control
them. Recycle differs from reusing simply by the fact that it is notyou
who is reusing them! Recycle means that they go back to a central plant
which melts, changes them back into a state that they then can change
into what ever product they want it to be like a can of beer for
example. While reuseing is smore simple then that. You reuse at home,
everything is recycled.

<STRONG><H2>Rethink</H2></STRONG>

This process is what keeps us  a breast of what must be changed in
order to keep up with evolution.Change occurs when we fail to keep up
with the changes ocurring around us. Change also happens when we
realize or make a leap into another plane another level of
conscoiusness. As we rethink we grow.

<STRONG><H2>Replant</H2></STRONG>
This is probably our last hope of ever bring back the great forests
that once covered the earth. This may neverhappen but we must try. By
planting more and more trees each year, it will takes thousands of
years for the earth to recover, after all whats a thousand years or
two?
