Hot Topic -- How good is your HMO?

<h3> How Good is <i>YOUR</i> HMO? </h3>

<p>
HMO's -- Good health care for people with disabilities? Or,
	  a dangerous jungle of peril? Some folks swear by them. Some 
 	  swear <i>at</i> them. What do <i> you</i> say?<br>

<h3>Be careful</h3>
<p>
I have a friend with pretty severe cerebral palsy. He is wheelchair
bound and
needs lots of assistance with eating and daily care. Because of his
disability his verbal communication is slow and deliberate which
tends to
make people think he is less inteligent than he is. He is very
inteligent and
edits a local newsletter as well as correponds on the internet with
people
around the world. He has been living independently for over 20
years with the
assistance of his friend who has a less sever case of cerebral
palsy, he is
presently 45.
<p>
 Four weeks ago he developed tingling in his leg and went to the
emergency room. A vascular study done with ultrasound determined
there were
no circulatory problems and he was referred to his primary care
physician. A
couple of days latter the tingling had spread to his other
extremities and he
began to lose strength in them.
<p>
His primary care physician refered him to a neurologist and ordered
a CT scan
of the head and an EEG. The neurologist would not see him until
September (in
3 1/2 months). My friend was on Medi-Cal (a California phenomena).
His PCP
indicated he should be eligibal for Medi-Care because of his
disability. This
would enable him to be seen sooner. He inquired with the Social
Security
Administration and was told he was not eligible for Medi-Care. The
neurologists office was contacted and informed about his daily
regression. He
could not be seen until September unless someone cancelled.
<p>
After having his tests completed he returned to his PCP. By now he
had lost
his ability to bear any weight on his legs or use his computer and
was having
bowel and bladder changes. His PCP ordered a cervical spine x-ray
and
suggested going to the emergency room at the local medical center
where the
neurologists are on call. This was also suggested by the
radiologist
examining the x-rays and an orthopaedic surgeon on call at the
community
hospital where the x-rays were taken.
<p>
We followed this advice and picked up the CT scan and x-rays and
brought them
to the emergency room of the local medical center. My friend was
seen by the
ER physician who immediatly consulted with the neurologist on call.
They
agreed that he needed to be admitted. That was 1 week ago, today my
friend
had surgery on his neck at the C-3 level to decompress his spinal
cord and
stabilize it using metal plates. The neurosugeon was very
optimistic about
him having function return to his extremities. If he had waited
until
September, this may not have been so.
<p>
The moral of the story is, if you have a condition that is going
from bad to
worse and you are having trouble bucking the system, go to your
local medical
center where specialists are on call. When you have taken care of
your
problem try to change the system. I will call the neurologist (the
one who
would not see him) on Monday and raise a little hell.

<h3>Live with it</h3>
<p>
We read the take on hmo's, but what does one with a disability and
on
income that is 1/4 the monthly income before. ANSWER: GET AN HMO
THAT
WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND. I'M NOT SAYING LOVE IT, BUT LIVE WITH IT.
HANDLE IT.

I have never had a problem with my HMO here in AZ.... they always
have 
been very good doctors that I was referred to and very
accommodating.  
<p>
When I need pain meds I have never been denied them.  I suffer from
Post 
Polio and degenerative rheumatoid arthritis.  Since I have a fused
knee 
and have been overdosed so to speak on may a steriod, I have to
take care 
 of myself in a preventive type way and my doctors are and always
have 
been very assistive. I have had the gamit of orthos here in the
valley 
and they get to know me for what I am, for I never let up on what
I do 
how I do it and how I will always be an advocate for my disability. 
In 
fact initiated a program for disability awareness and will now
develop a 
training unit to make staff sensitive to disabled patrons in all
venues.
<p>
 My body was probably not up to managing another season of football

stadium patrons so we decided training all staff for this would be
the 
next step. I love my job. I sometimes cannot work all day but I
sure am 
zealous to the point where I do my job the best I can until my body
gives 
me signs of slow down.  I have problems with soft tissue injuries
and 
healing for me is a long time when even my body has a strain or a
sprain. 
<p> 
I am very happy with my insurance though, my doctors assisting me
is why 
I am able to do what I do in a still upright position.  I know a
chair is 
in the horizon, but I will try everything until that comes to that.

<h3>Squeaking wheel</h3>
<p>
Having been a member of a HMO, Maxicare, for over 13 years, I can 
attest to the fact that the squeaking wheel gets
the oil or "if you want good care you have to know how to play the 
system.
<p>
I am a post-polio quad maintaining a full time practice as an
Enrolled Agent which means 16 hours per day, 7 days a week for 4 
months and 40 hour weeks the rest of the year.
<p>
When I feel that a medical problem that I have is not getting
proper 
attention I go to the medical director of the group in I am
enrolled 
and let him know my concerns.
<p>
In this way I have received referrals to excellent outside 
specialists and feel that I am getting top-notch care.

Most people are not aware that when they sign the contract with the
health
insurance company, they are signing that they waive away their
right to sue
that company....check your policy!  Most people (that I've
questioned), are
not aware that in most HMOs the M.D. is given a bonus for not
prescribing
high-dollar antibiotics, and are  also given a bonus for not
discussing
(telling a patient) about their true condition if it is going to
involve
high-dollar treatment.  I've asked M.D.s about this, and they admit
it's
true.
<p>
  I am a registered nurse, and I can tell you that if you try to
treat
some types of infection with a low-cost antibiotic, (erythromycin
as an
example) when you really need something like Ceclor...which costs
more, you
may as well drink water for all the good it will do you.  There is
a number
you can call to complain about HMOs, but be aware that are
overwhelmed. 
<p>
According to an article I read in one of my journals, they are not
truely
capable of handling the responses they are getting.  Also, if you
work for
the U.S. government, they cannot help you, and no one seems to be
able to
tell me who can....I'm still doing research on that one.  The
number for

The Department of Corporations is
1 (800) 400-0815

<p>
I feel the way to handle this is to do it yourself.  Get
mad....make
calls....and complain!  Don't let them put you off, get copies of
ALL your
records...then request copies of every visit thereafter.  Let the
insurance
company know that you are not going to take some mealy-mouthed
answers, and
you are going to let everyone know how you are treated.  We hear
horror
stories, and we can't believe it will happen to us...trust
me...it's only a
matter of time before you are the one telling the stories.  Do
something
now...write letters...talk to people waiting in line at the bank or
store...spread the news.  You are not alone in this, and if enough
of us
take a stand we can do something.  Feel free to write me with any
ideas,
and also with anything that you have found out....let's put it all
together.  
Last but definately not least...a personal thank you to the
webmaster of
this site.  Keep up the good work!

<h3>We need a law</h3>
<p>
A law should be passed where physician must be paid a set fee, and not 
by how much money they save the HMO. I am with Kaiser and not once, in 
13 years, has my primary physician recommended a complete physical.
<p>
Another problem with the system is when doctors operate their own 
practice during the week and work part time at an HMO on the weekend.

<h3>We need control</h3>
<p>
I have had reasonably good luck with my HMO for basic whitebread
health care, i.e., bronchitis, indigestion, etc. When it comes to
dealing with "scary" stuff, like chronic pain, ongoing physical
therapy, and diagnosis of sci related symptoms, far too much
depends on the personal biases and philosophy of the primary care
physician.
<p>
I am a professional, employed full-time in my field, and do not
wish to go on full, or even partial disability leave from my
career.  At the same time, I am a wheelchair user who deals daily
with severe pain and the various the effects of sci and arthritis
(and middle age, and bad hair).  Because I insist on continuing to
be professionally and socially active outside the home, my doctors
are opposed to prescribing effective pain medication (anything
stronger than ibuprophin).
<p>
  When I request review by a specialist, they tend to select other
doctors that share their bias against analgesics. (I was told by
one, "If you can sit here and discuss the issue with me, you don't
need it, yet.")
<p>
I cannot afford to change to a more expensive health care plan that
give me more control.  I have been on this carousel for over twelve
years, and the HMO system makes it difficult to get second opinions
from physicians unconnected with the primary care physician.  When,
due to bias, or lack of knowledge, or state- or lawsuit-induced
fear, our doctors won't go to bat for us, how can we work within
the HMO system to shop for doctors that will?

<h3>Not for us</h3>
<p>
HMO's are not for people with disabilities.  In fact, they are not
for sick people either.  They are in the business of making money
only and that means selling insurance to healthy, young people
only.  God help them if they get sick or disabled, because the HMO
won't!
