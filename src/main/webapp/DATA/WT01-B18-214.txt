The second solar thermal technology, central receivers - or 
"power towers" - have yet to be demonstrated on a commercial scale.<a href="#350" name="r350"> [ 350 ] </a>
However, a 10-megawatt plant is scheduled to begin operation in early 1996 
and continue through 1998. The project, known as Solar Two, is a 
partnership between the U.S. DOE and a consortium led by <A NAME="SouthernCaliforniaEdison">Southern California Edison<a>. The project is upgrading a prior 10-megawatt 
demonstration system, known as Solar One, that produced more than 35,000 
megawatt-hours of electricity at an installed capacity cost of 
approximately $14,000 per kilowatt-hour.<a href="#351" name="r351"> [ 351 ] </a>The new system is expected to 
do better, and will use a molten salt thermal storage system, enabling it 
to assist Southern California Edison's peak demand period by extending 
electricity generation into the early evening hours.<BR>

 <p>     <A NAME="Bechtel ">Bechtel</a> Corporation.</B></I> Bechtel, with headquarters in San 
Francisco, is the project team manager for Solar Two, the 10-megawatt 
central receiver "power tower" project sponsored by a consortium of 15 
companies and utilities, as well as the U.S. DOE. The consortium and the 
DOE will split the total cost of the project, estimated to be $48.5 
million. Bechtel designed the Solar Two system, which basically converts 
the Solar One facility in Daggett, California from a pressurized 
water/steam receiver and oil/rock storage system to a molten nitrate salt 
receiver and thermal storage system. Solar Two will be able to collect and 
store solar heat in molten salt during the day and then generate 
electricity with it during cloudy periods or in the early evening, during 
peak demand. Construction began on Solar Two in November 1994. The 
consortium hopes to bring Solar Two on-line in late 1995 and to complete 
testing in 1998. The sponsors of Solar Two also contracted with Bechtel to 
develop a plan to commercialize the technology.<a href="#352" name="r352"> [ 352 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="350"  HREF="#r350">350.</a> Central receiver technology consists of a fixed receiver mounted on a 
tower surrounded by a large array of mirrors, known as heliostats. The 
heliostats track the sun and reflect its rays onto the receiver, which 
absorbs the heat. Within the receiver, a fluid absorbs the receiver's heat 
energy and then is transported from the receiver to a turbine generator or 
a storage tank. <I>Id., </I>p. 454.<BR>
