<h3>U.S. OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTERS JOIN DOE/EPA PROGRAM
TO HELP REALIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY, COST SAVINGS</h3><p>


Colorado Springs, Colo., June 17, 1996 &fnof;&fnof;  The U.S. Olympic Committee joined the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today in a signing ceremony to pledge the Olympic's commitment to implement cost-effective energy-efficiency and pollution preventions measures.  <P>

	As a partner in DOE's and EPA's Climate Wise program, a voluntary initiative to promote voluntary pollution prevention and energy efficiency in the private sector, the Olympic Committee has agreed to develop a Climate Wise Action Plan within six months to specify their projects to implement through the year 2000 to reduce wastes and green house emissions, thereby reducing operating costs.  Technologies will be implemented in the Olympic Committee's three major training facilities in Colorado Springs, Colo., Lake Placid, NY and San Diego, Calif.<P>

	"The Department of Energy is _____ to be a part of making the 1996 Summer Games the greenest Olympics ever," said Christine Ervin, DOE's Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  "The Olympics provide a perfect venue for the Climate Wise program to showcase smart renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, which will help save the Olympics money, improve efficiency and protect the environment."<P>

	Climate Wise brings together industry, government, research and development organizations and financial institutions to find creative ways to improve idustrial efficiency. The Climate Wise/Olympic Climate Wise partership involves DOE's Denver Regional Support Office, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, EPA, Colorado State University, ??___________________, and the U.S. Olympic Committee.<P>

	Additional involvement of DOE with the Olympics include creating an entity called the "Team Energy" which are a team of experts who will showcase energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies at this summer's games in Atlanta. <P>

	Technologies demonstrated at the Olympics include solar systems at the Olympic swimming pool (photovoltaics and solar thermal); geothermal heat pumps at the Olympic security center; a dish/Stirling demonstration at the Olympic complex at Georgia Tech; solar-powered lights at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center; alternative fuel buses (CNG and LNG) in bus fleets throughout the city; and the Southface Energy and Environmental Resource Center in Atlanta, an energy&fnof;efficient building equipped with a geothermal heat pump system, solar-powered shingles and a passive design for heating and cooling.  <P>

	Additional national Climate Wise partners include companies such as DuPont, AT&T, Georgia-Pacific, Fetzer Vineyards, CF&I Steel, Conoco, Coors Brewing Company, Hewlett Packard, Lockheed Martin Astronautics and Samsonite.  Government agencies including the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, DOE and EPA are ______.   Non-government organization members include the League of Women Voters and the Colorado Public Interest Group.  <P>
