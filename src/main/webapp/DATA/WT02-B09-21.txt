<h2>From Allan's Desk</h2>
<p>I know it&#146;s hard to believe but it is true, I finally
arrived at CSL. Hopefully, your level of relief coincides with my
level of exhilaration at taking on a new challenge -- one that
promises new directions for the company. I hope to provide you
with new insights and perspectives in addressing licensing and
other concerns.</p>
<p>After 32 years of government service, I am ready for the
exciting challenge of the private sector and the possibilities
therein. I feel fortunate to be a part of CSL and work with so
many leading-edge companies.</p>
<p>My first priority in this period of transition is to establish
the ties with you that I am sure will develop into a long and
fruitful business relationship. I have enjoyed conversing with
you and I look forward to playing an important role in furthering
your export interests.</p>
<p>The timing of CSL&#146;s annual seminar couldn&#146;t be
better. It will enable me to meet many of you first-hand and give
us the opportunity to discuss mutual concerns in a constructive
and relaxed fashion. In the meantime, all of us at CSL look
forward to doing whatever we can to assist you. Please do not
hesitate to call.</p>

<h2>Executive Notes</h2>
<p><strong>EAR UPDATE</strong><br>
The Bureau of Export Administration will publish a notice (in the
next few weeks) in the Federal Register extending the deadline
for compliance with the new EAR to December 31, 1996. In
addition, BXA will publish a notice debundling the LST exception:
if using LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, CTP write that abbreviation on the
Shipper&#146;s Export Declaration instead of LST. Also, the
sub-abbreviations (such as PTS for spare parts under the category
RPL replacement spare parts) are eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>22 CFR 126.1 CHANGES . . . AGAIN!</strong><br>
The State Department issued the official notice on August 12
removing the Ukraine from the list of proscribed destinations
listed at 22 CFR 126.1(a). Now applications for the Ukraine will
be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>SLOVENIA MAY BE ADDED TO FIRST-TIER LIST</strong><br>
Secretary of Defense William Perry may show support for including
Slovenia in the first tier of nations to be eligible for NATO
expansion. NATO expansion will be discussed at the next meeting
of NATO participants in December.</p>
<p><strong>ENCRYPTION WEEK<br>
</strong>Several industry associations joined forces to sponsor
&quot;CRYPTO-ACTION WEEK,&quot; September 3-10, 1996, to mobilize
support in favor of the liberalization of national encryption
policy. The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Electronic
Freedom Foundation (EFF), the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC) and Wired Magazine encourage participation in two
ways: sign the petition at http://www.crypto.com/ petition, and
make an appointment with a congressperson&#146;s local office to
discuss the issue. These groups hope to put pressure on the House
and Senate to bring cryptography bills to the floor: the
Burns/Leahy Pro-CODE bill awaits a vote by the Senate Commerce
Committee; and, the Goodlate bill, HR 3011, awaits a hearing by
the House Judiciary Committee. The Clinton Administration opposes
both bills.</p>
<h3>CLINTON MAY REVERSE POLICY ON SOUTH AMERICA</h3>
<p>According to the Dallas Morning News and The Washington Post
President Clinton may reverse the US policy on the sale of
advanced weapons to South America in order to gain votes. The
sale of Lockheed- Martin-made F-16s to Chile and Brazil could
create thousands of jobs and increase Clinton&#146;s popularity
in Texas. Chile wants to buy 20-odd fighters and Brazil may be in
the market for up to 150. 200 export sales translates to $4
billion in exports and 4,000 jobs. </p>
<p>South American policy is a hot issue in the Administration and
has been under internal debate for many months. Also, arms policy
towards South America may become a campaign issue: the relaxation
of controls is part of the Republican platform.</p>
<p>International opinions on the proposed change are mixed.
Brazil, Chile and Peru strongly favor the proposed new policy.
Argentina, on the other hand, urged the administration not to
change the policy as it would lead to an arms race in the region. </p>
<p>The current policy debate may prevent US firms from competing
in Brazil&#146;s fighter contest, possibly worth $5.2 billion for
72 aircraft. Brazil is interested in F-16 and Navy F/A-18
fighters, but it is unclear whether Clinton will allow the sale.
It is quickly becoming a policy test case.</p>
<p>The issue of sales to Peru is a fiery topic considering its
recent border conflict with Ecuador. US negotiators are trying to
resolve the dispute and do not want to alienate either side with
the arms issue.</p>
<p>Last month Defense Secretary William Perry urged to Clinton to
end the ban, but Secretary of State, Warren Christopher said the
ban is necessary because of regional instability. Indeed,
Christopher hopes to broach restraint in conventional arms sales
to Latin America through the Wassenaar Arrangement.</p>
<h3>1995 ARMS SALES TOTALS SURPRISE</h3>
<p>The total of world arms sales fell in 1995 to $28.8 billion,
the lowest level since the Cold War. Russia&#146;s total sales
topped $9 billion, a sharp increase from the $3.8 billion total
in 1994. China accounted for the majority of purchases, acquiring
S7-27 fighter planes and Kilo-class attack submarines. The US
total was $8.2 billion, down from $12.8 billion in 1994.
France&#146;s total also declined sharply from $8.9 billion in
1994 to $3.8 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>For the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union,
Russia sold more arms to developing countries last year than any
other supplier, with a commitment for $6 billion worth of
munitions items. However, Russia&#146;s willingness to use
incentives and offsets may lead to long-term problems. According
to Defense News, the high level of technology transferred, and
the skill-level of the purchasing countries (China, India, etc.)
will probably lead to those countries manufacturing the
equipment. </p>
<p>The US Government came in second, with $3.789 billion and
France, third with $2.4 billion. These totals include all
government transfers to countries excluding the US, Russia,
nations of the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand.</p>
<h3>IRAN LIBYA SANCTIONS CONTROVERSY CONTINUES</h3>
<p>Nations around the would condemned the US for the Iran Libya
Oil Sanctions Act, the new law penalizing firms that invest in
the energy sectors of Iran and Libya. The EU and other groups
denounced the measure as violation of world trade law, as it is
third party application of US law. The EU is preparing
retributive sanctions to counter the US ones.</p>
<p>The measure is designed to punish Iran and Libya for the
support of terrorism.</p>
<p>Iran denounced the measure as the act of a &quot;slave&quot;
of Israel. Direct trade between the US and both Iran and Libya is
already prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Turkey recently signed a $23 billion gas development deal with
Iran that may be subject to the sanctions. Under the 23 year
deal, a pipeline would be built to supply Turkey with oil. Turkey
claims the deal is not an investment in the energy sector,
instead a simple purchase, and therefore not subject to the
sanctions. However, the deal will not help the US-Turkish
relationship, already shaky.</p>
<p>France&#146;s Total SA has a $600 million deal with Iran to
develop offshore oil sources. Total SA would be sanctioned under
the act with possible penalties including: banning executives
from the US, limiting US investment in the firms, and banning the
company from all export transactions.</p>
<p>Most nations have a trading relationship with Iran, but not
Libya.</p>

<h2>SECURITY OF AIRFREIGHT CARGO</h2>
<p><strong>by Peter O&#146;Rorke</strong></p>
<p>The recent tragedy of TWA 800 has again thrown airline
security arrangements into the spotlight. The media attention has
focused on measures designed to check the luggage of passengers,
but of course cargo represents just as significant a threat. As
exporters, we share a duty to maintain the most stringent
security arrangements possible will all air shipments. This means
thought must be given to all aspects of your purchasing,
trucking, packing and international forwarding operations. In
many companies these functions are separate, so it is up to
managers and other executives to ensure that your company is
vigilant throughout all these departments.</p>
<p><strong>Freight Security Hints:</strong><br>
Become familiar with your US vendors. Learn about their
organization. Tell them that the goods you are purchasing from
them may be air freighted. If they are packing for export, make
sure they do this in a secure area.</p>
<p>Use reputable truckers who move the material quickly and
directly . Avoid leaving your shipments with others, in trucker
warehouses, etc.</p>
<p>Carefully inspect all material when received. If packed for
export, check for signs of tampering. If only a domestic pack, is
the packaging intact? When you repack for export or consolidate
with other items, ensure that this is done in a secure area to
with controlled access.</p>
<p>If you use a freight forwarder, ask them to prove to you that
your material is in secure storage until it is delivered to the
airline. Check them out! Drive out to their offices/warehouses
and see how long you can wander around without being challenged.</p>
<p>There has been effort by the FAA and airlines following the
TWA crash to tighten up security. This involves the use of
exporter signed certificates that must be delivered to the
airline with the cargo. Those are currently rather vague and most
of us in the industry believe that these forms will be replaced
with more detailed ones that show more information about the
shipment. More to the point, however, is to remember that a
signed form is no substitute for proper procedure, constantly
enforced, to ensure that the cargo you export does not contain
the makings of another disaster. </p>
<hr>
<h2>TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS</h2>
<h3>CWC: DEADLINE LOOMS</h3>
<p>The Senate must consider the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
by September 15, 1996, and it is likely to reach the floor soon
after the Summer recess ends September 3. The CWC is almost
universally supported -- by the Administration, the Joint Chiefs,
the Commerce Department and the Chemical Manufacturers
Association. Its few detractors include -- Sen. Jessie Helms
(R-SC) and the Heritage Foundation -- who claim the regulations
will unfairly impact small businesses.</p>
<p>If the CWC is ratified by 65 nations (60 have done so to date)
it will enter into force. Six months after the 65th nation
ratifies, the CWC will require companies to register with their
respective governments if they manufacture chemical weapons
agents or precursors. There is a three-tiered schedule of
compliance according to the strength and type of the chemical
agents. Companies must register and they may be subject to
international inspections. In the US, these regulations will be
administered by the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>Most experts predict the CWC will have little impact on US
businesses. In fact, it could actually help US commerce, by
forcing other nations to be more transparent with their own
chemical industries.</p>
<h3>CTBT NEGOTIATIONS FAIL</h3>
<p>After months of efforts negotiators could not come to an
agreement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). India
vetoed the current language on August 15 and ended any chance of
a treaty in the near future. India demanded that the five
declared nuclear powers China, France, Russia, US and UK agree to
a timetable for complete nuclear disarmament before it would
sign. None of the five agreed to this plan.</p>
<p>Because of India&#146;s opposition, the treaty cannot be
presented to the UN General Assembly by the UN Conference on
Disarmament as planned. However, Mexico, Brazil, Egypt, Peru and
Pakistan, in a group lead by Australia, are expected to present
the CTBT to the General Assembly as the &quot;Friends of the
CTBT.&quot; The treaty can pass the General Assembly with a
simple majority. However, current language makes it necessary for
all 44 states with nuclear reactors to agree to ratify the
treaty, thus India can prevent ratification. Iran also voiced
objections to the CTBT.</p>
<p>In fact, India may begin to more aggressively pursue its own
missile programs and reserves the right to build the bomb. A
large majority supports their nuclear programs. If the Indian
Government did accept the current CTBT language, it could lose
the next election because of this issue alone. In a country full
of divergent views, nuclear arms is one of the few issues
unifying different groups.</p>
<p>Treaties already in force ban the test of nuclear arms
everywhere except under ground. China was the last country to
test their nuclear forces, with an underground explosion this
summer. France received international criticism for their tests
in the South Pacific several month ago. India has not tested a
nuclear device since their sole explosion in 1974, but is widely
believed to have the capability of assembling a nuclear warhead
in a limited amount of time. Pakistan and Israel have not tested,
but are believed to have the technology.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jawaharlal Nehru, India&#146;s first Prime
Minister, first proposed the idea of a nuclear test ban in 1954.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIOLATIONS</h2>
<h3>GERMANS SOLD CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO LIBYA</h3>
<p>German authorities arrested two businessmen for allegedly
selling chemical weapons equipment to Libya. According to
intelligence sources, the smuggling operation allowed the Libyans
to rebuild a major chemical plant.</p>
<p>The chemical weapons equipment in question would allow the
Libyans to mix poison gases in a full automated environment,
allowing sarin and soman poison gases to be mixed safely. The
equipment was purchased for $2.15 million from Siemens AG and
diverted through Belgium.</p>
<p>German Authorities only released the first names of the two --
Udo B. and Detlef C., and the full name of Berge Balanian, the
suspected middle man.</p>
<p>The Germans are being held in investigative custody while the
government investigates them and seeks Balanian, believed to be
in Libya. Opposition parties accused the Social Democrat
Government of having an ineffective export regime.</p>
<h3>NATO SEIZES MORE CROAT WEAPONS</h3>
<p>NATO seized a 106 mm rifle, anti-tank weapons, grenades, mines
and other equipment at a police station in Croat-controlled
territory. All weapons in the former Yugoslavia are supposed to
be kept in NATO-monitored storage facilities.</p>
<h3>DID YOU KNOW?????</h3>
<p>A few helpful hints for DTC cases:</p>
<p>Licensing Officers at DTC are returning without actions cases
because the backup data is not collated into sets. Remember, in
most cases 7 collated sets of technical data must be submitted.
When in doubt, always submit 7 collated sets, it is not worth
risking a RWA!</p>
<p>Be careful when referencing &quot;attachments.&quot; You
should only reference items like freight forwarder lists and
parts lists as attachments -- pages that will actually become
part of the license. Other technical data or contracts should not
be referenced as an attachment, because it will not be part of
the issued license. If a U.S. Customs officer notes a reference
to an attachment that is not part of the license, it may delay to
confusion and delay your shipment.</p>
<p>When applying for a spare parts license, it is not necessary
to attach a complete parts list. Lengthy lists only create more
work for you, State and Customs. State will stamp the approved
license with the &quot;no major components authorized&quot;
message to ensure only spare parts go out on the license. Customs
can track spares shipments by the dollar value alone.</p>
<p>DTC and DoD are examining licenses to send drawings in support
of a request for quotation with increased scrutiny. When
submitting this kind of case, be sure to explain exactly what the
drawings will be used for, and why this transaction does not give
manufacturing know-how or other technical assistance. The burden
is on the applicant to show the transaction does not require a
TAA or MLA.</p>
<hr>
<h2>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<h3>CHINA-TAIWAN-US TENSION OVER MISSILE SALES</h3>
<p>he continuing saga of Sino-US-Taiwan triangle continued this
month over new Taiwanese purchases. Taiwan will buy $420 million
worth of US weapons including 1,299 Stinger missiles, launchers,
and .50 caliber ammunition. China immediately denounced the
proposed sale saying it would damage bilateral relations and
amounted to American instigation of Taiwan&#146;s separatism.
China considers Taiwan to be a rebel province.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said the sale violated the 1982 agreement
to reduce arms sales to Taiwan. That agreement guides all US arms
transfers to Taiwan. No offensive arms are currently sold to
Taiwan and transfers of new equipment are scrutinized closely.</p>
<p>The Defense Department considers this sale to be a &quot;done
deal&quot; and the State Department supports it as consistent
with US foreign policy towards Taiwan and will not affect the
regional military balance. The sale will not require extensive US
training or assistance.</p>
<p>The sale of Avenger anti-aircraft missile systems to Taiwan
also angers China. The State Department approved that sale two
years ago. It is consistent with the US policy to sell only
defensive weapons to Taiwan. Deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said
there were no plans to reconsider the previous decision.</p>
<h3>CHINA TRANSFERRED MISSILE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY TO PAKISTAN</h3>
<p>Late in August the Washington Post revealed US intelligence
sources strongly suspect that China is transferring missile
manufacturing technology to Pakistan. The secret factory, capable
of manufacturing medium range M-11 type missiles, was built
outside the capital city of Islamabad with drawings and hardware
supplied by the government of China. The factory is still under
construction, but is suspected of having production capabilities
within two years. Some intelligence sources suspect Pakistan is
developing nuclear warheads for these missiles.</p>
<p>Vice President Al Gore confirmed (vaguely) the accuracy of the
Post&#146;s report by admitting the Administration is discussing
the issue with the Chinese.</p>
<p>The transfer of this technology is in direct violation of
China&#146;s pledge to adhere to the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) guidelines. China pledged not to transfer
MTCR-controlled know-how and material after the US imposed
sanctions related to a previous transfer to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Intelligence sources do not know if the factory will be
capable of producing complete missiles. Pakistan may need to
import guidance systems to make the M-11 clones function. </p>
<p>It is unclear what the US will do at this point. By law, the
Administration must impose sanctions if China violates its
pledge, but is the Administration willing or able to prove the
violations occurred? Sino-American relations have been
extraordinarily tense in the past year; conflicts over the US
visit of Taiwan&#146;s president, China&#146;s war-games,
intellectual property disputes, the suspected Chinese transfer of
ring magnets to Pakistan and human rights concerns have impacted
bilateral relations. Only recently, had the two countries begun
to patch up these sore spots.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event the Administration does impose the MTCR
sanctions, exports to China would be limited even further and
most imports from China would be banned for two years. Sanctions
would effect $39 billion worth of annual trade between the
nations. </p>
<p>So far Pakistan has denied the existence of the factory and
China has refused to comment.</p>
<h3>IRAN FILES TWO GERMAN SUITS</h3>
<p>Iran announced in late August it will sue German government
officials, and German powerhouse Siemens A.G. for their roles in
two unrelated matters.</p>
<p>The suit against the German officials seeks punitive damages
for the role Germany played in helping Iraq with its chemical
weapons programs. Iraqi chemical weapons were used against Iran
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>Iran is suing Siemens for $5.4 billion worth of damages
because the firm did not complete a nuclear power plant. Siemens
abandoned the project in 1979 after the Islamic revolution.
Siemens announced in 1992, it could not fulfill its end of the
contract because the German government would not let it export
critical parts to Iran. Russia signed an $800 million deal to
complete the Bushehr plant.</p>
<h3>UAE NARROWS AIRCRAFT CHOICE TO F-16 and RAFALE</h3>
<p>In the stiff competition to win the UAE&#146;s $6 billion
aircraft contract, only the F-16 and the Rafale remain alive. The
final decision will be announced in the next few months. The UAE
may also purchase a few more Mirage 2000s to complement its
existing fleet of 36 Mirages. Whatever planes are selected,
delivery will not be made until 2000.</p>
<h3>ISRAEL SEEKS FMS SURCHARGE WAIVER</h3>
<p>Israel asked the US to waive the 3 percent surcharge on all
FMS deals, a move which would give Israel an effective $35
million increase in annual aid. Currently all nations receiving <br>
FMS assistance must pay the surcharge to the Pentagon. Israel
seeks a waiver because the $1.8 billion annual assistance they
receive does not have the same purchasing power it did in the
1980s. The Pentagon has not commented, but a waiver is unlikely,
because it would require additional surcharges be placed on other
nations&#146; aid.</p>
<h3>EU TO REVIEW MISSILE JV</h3>
<p>The European Commission is investigating the proposed missile
joint venture between British Aerospace and Lagardere Groupe. The
consolidation of the two firms&#146; guided missile programs may
strengthen their already dominant position, and thus be
objectionable by the Commission. If the merger goes forward, it
will create the largest guided weapons business in Europe.
Analysts see the merger as a key step in the consolidation of the
European defense industry.</p>
<h3>ASIA TURNS TO SUBS</h3>
<p>In recent months Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and
North Korea have all made moves to upgrade or acquire submarines.
Defense analysts point to a perceived threat from China as the
explanation for the renewed interest in the underwater arena.
According to Defense News, Japan in particular has monitored
China&#146;s sub activities with interest. However, budgets are
limited and most Asian nations are looking at long-term
acquisition strategies and diesel equipment to save cash.</p>
<h3>AFGHANISTAN APPEALS FOR ARMS</h3>
<p>President Burhanuddin Rabbini of Afghanistan appealed to the
UN not to impose an arms embargo on his nation, because rebels
will still be able to get shipments. The proposed embargo,
designed to keep rebel factions from getting weapons, will be
debated b the UN General Assembly this month. The US added
Afghanistan to its list of proscribed destinations (22 CFR 126.1)
last month, and is asking the Wassenaar Arrangement countries to
consider adding Afghanistan and the Sudan to its list of
proscribed countries.</p>
<h3>UKRAINE SELLS TANKS TO PAKISTAN</h3>
<p>Ukraine recently sold 300 T-80UD tanks worth $550 million to
Pakistan. The Ukraine has increasingly turned to South Asia for
sales -- recently closing deals with India for military trucks
and with Sri Lanka for military transport planes. Since the
collapse of the Soviet Union the Ukraine lost most of its defense
sales.</p>
<h3>MALAYSIAN OFFICERS</h3>
<p>An opposition leader accused the defense ministry of
purchasing sub-standard equipment from ex-officers this month.
The government demanded the names of these officers to pursue the
allegations. The equipment in questions may be obsolete and
effect the readiness of the Malaysian Air Force. Malaysia has
spent $4.4 billion on defense in the past five years.</p>
<h3>POLAND TO RECONSIDER BOSNIAN TANK DEAL</h3>
<p>According to Prime Minister Cimoszewicz, Poland will consider
carefully the US proposal to supply Polish tanks to Bosnia. Under
the US proposal, NATO funds would be used to buy $50 million
worth of T-72 tanks for the Bosnian army. Poland&#146;s caution
stems from concerns over regional stability.</p>
<h3>BUSINESS NEWS</h3>
<p>Austria ordered sights and stands for a new anti-tank missile
system from Bofors of Sweden. The $20.5 million deal will be
completed in 1998.</p>
<p>DynCorp was awarded a key subcontract from Battelle Memorial
Institute to provide support to the Army&#146;s preparations for
the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</p>
<p>British Aerospace won a tech-transfer contract from the Saudis
to maintain their Tornado warplanes. Major offsets are involved
in the contract. The total value of the deal has not been
released as of yet.</p>
<h3>HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS CALL FOR INDONESIAN ARMS BAN</h3>
<p>The Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights and
Human Rights Watch-Asia called for a ban on munitions trade with
Indonesia and the end to all state visits to the island nation.
Indonesia recently cracked down on all political opposition and
rioting disrupted the capital. The US State Department already
bans all small weapons and crowd-control equipment to Indonesia.</p>
<h3>TURKEY AND POLAND BUY HELICOPTERS</h3>
<p>Turkey announced plans to spend $3 billion on 145 new attack
helicopters over the next ten years. The government is accepting
bids and will look at the offset package in particular when
evaluating proposals. Helicopters under consideration include the
UHU-HAS Tiger, the A-129 Mangusta, the Mi-28, the AH-64 Apache,
the AH-1W Super Cobra and the RAH-66 Comanche.</p>
<p>Poland will soon announce who won its Huzar combat helicopter
upgrade. The Elbit-Rafael team is expected to win the deal.
Proposals from Israel Aircraft Industries, Lod, Euromissile S.A.
and Rockwell are also under consideration. The deal will also
include offsets.</p>
<h3>IRAQ STILL CIRCUMVENTING UN</h3>
<p>UN Inspector Rolf Ekeus reported to the UN Security Council
that Iraq continues to violate its promise to allow inspections
of weapons facilities. Iraq repeatedly denied UN inspectors
access to files and facilities, and even loaded some weapons on
trucks and trains to circumvent inspections. The UN maintains a
strict embargo against Iraq and will continue to do so until UN
inspectors are satisfied that Iraq has eliminated its chemical
and biological weapons and missile programs.</p>
<h3>US ANGERS THAILAND OVER MISSILE SALE</h3>
<p>The Clinton Administration rejected a request from Thailand to
allow the sale of AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air
missiles. Thailand wanted the missiles to equip their new F/18s.
However, the Administration was not persuaded by Thailand&#146;s
reasons for the sale, and the US has a position not to introduce
new weapons technology into a region. If Malaysia buys Russian
AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot; missiles, the US will reconsider the
AIM-120 question.</p>
<h3>RUSSIA WILL HELP IRAN BUILD SATELLITE</h3>
<p>Russia agreed to help Iran build and launch its first
satellite in the next three years. Russia is Iran&#146;s largest
arms supplier and helped Iran build its first nuclear power
plant. The purpose of the satellite has not been released.</p>
<h3>RUSSIAN FIRMS SAYS NO TAIWAN SALE</h3>
<p>Taiwan announced this month they wanted to buy Russian
helicopters, but arms exporter Rosvooruzheniye, denies any deal.
Taiwan is interested in Russian helicopters because they are
cheap and did not expect Russia to turn away a potential sale.
Russia has not ruled out the sale, but said they will be very
cautious because of the effect on PRC relations. The PRC is
Russia&#146;s largest arms customer and their huge orders helped
Russia reclaim the top world sales title for 1995.</p>
