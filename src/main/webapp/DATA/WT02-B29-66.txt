<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Retirement Realities and U.S. Savings Trends</FONT></STRONG><P>

One of the great American dreams is to retire with enough financial
security to live
comfortably and
enjoy all of the good things life has to offer. For some, it may be a cozy
condo on the ninth
hole of their
favorite golf course, traveling throughout the world, or helping a loved
one with the cost of
paying for a
college education. Each day, more and more people are coming to the
realization that unless
they save
for retirement, their dreams of enjoying the good things in life will not
be realized. What
can you do?
<P>
In today's competitive business environment, retirement benefits are
critical to attract
and retain
quality people, build loyalty and morale, and help your employees
enjoy a secure
future. To just
maintain their current standard of living, your employees will need to
subsidize their Social
Security
income with savings, investments, and perhaps most importantly, an
employer pension plan.
Building
a reserve of assets through a pension plan is a way to ensure that the
money set aside today
will pay
for what is needed at retirement. Consider the following trends:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Americans are living healthier and longer.

<LI>The average working American will need between 70-80% of
pre-retirement income to
maintain
their present standard of living. Adequate retirement planning could mean
the difference
between
thriving and merely surviving during retirement years.

<LI>The savings rate in the United States is shrinking. The Federal
Reserve System indicates
that the
savings rate of disposable income in 1973 was 9.4%, versus 3% today. This
indicates that many
Americans face the possibility of insufficient income in the future. This
is compounded when
we
consider that the rate of inflation is expected to continue growing.

<LI>Although debated for many years, we are coming to the realization that
Social
Security
benefits may not be available for many. By the year 2011, America's
largest present
generation, the 75
million baby boomers, will start to retire. With less workers putting
money in, and more
retirees getting
paid, the promise that Social Security benefits will be available is not
guaranteed.
