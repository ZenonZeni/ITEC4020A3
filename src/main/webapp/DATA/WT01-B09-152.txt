<B>Project Title: EMI measurement & Mitigation Testing Through CT EVS<p>
Performing Organization: U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center </B>

<P><B>Project Summary</B></P>


<P>Project: RA95 Task 20<br>
Submitted by: U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center<br>
Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative </P>

<P>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is an unintentional form of Electromagnetic Energy
that can often effect both the performance of the system creating the interference as well
as external systems. An extreme example of EMI is the case of electric vehicles causing
the inadvertent activation of bomb release mechanisms on aircraft. EMI typically
manifests itself as a loss of performance in systems that are exposed to the interference,
e.g., communication range is reduced, computers malfunction, or monitoring systems
fail. For this task, the Electric Vehicle (EV) will be used to evaluate the potential
emissions of the EV when used in today's hostile commercial EM environment. Our
approach will asses these risks including the possibility of the EV creating undesirable
EMI emissions that can effect others systems. The EV may also be susceptible to EMI
from the environment however the emphasis in this proposal will be directed toward
identification of EMI emissions from electric vehicles. In addition, we will seek to identify
appropriate EMI abatement techniques. When the responsible party has implemented
the recommended corrective measures, we will re­test the particular vehicle or
component to ensure desired performance.</P>

<P>Electric vehicles can have military as well as civilian applications. On the battle space
stealth is of fundamental importance. Vehicles can therefore gain a degree of stealth by
converting to electric drive vice internal combustion engine. As such, this proposal Will
identify the critical EMI issues that effect military electric vehicles on the battle space.
The measurement of electromagnetic emissions from both military as well as civilian
vehicles will be useful in creating an EV emission data base. This data base will then be
used to identify those EMI emissions issues that effect EV performance. </P>
