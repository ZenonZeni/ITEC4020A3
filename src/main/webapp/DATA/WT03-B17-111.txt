<H2>Typical Itinerary</H2>

After the 5 1/2 hr flight from Miami to Manaus, divers will be taken directly from the Manaus airport to the travel boat on the Rio Negro avoiding the trouble of checking into and out of a hotel.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Day 1:</FONT></B> Excursion to Orchid and Bromeliad Forest on the white sands in much of the Rio Negro drainage there are stunted and relatively open rainforests. The good light conditions in these communities has allowed for the evolution of a wealth of bromeliad and orchid species that cling to the trees. The excursion will encompass a walk of several hours into both tall and stunted rainforest.
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Day 2:</FONT></B> Morning Dive or Snorkel in Tributary Lake + Fish Roast and Night in Rainforest The lower Rio Negro region has a few clearwater tributaries. Depending on river level it should be possible to visit one of these for a morning dive before continuing travel upstream. In the evening there will be a fish roast (native species) and the night will be spent sleeping in hammocks in the rainforest.
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Day 3:</FONT></B> Explore Tall Rainforest and Visit to a Magnificent Kapok Cotton Tree. The Rio Branco is the largest tributary of the Rio Negro. It is located about 18 hours upriver of Manaus. Just below the Rio Branco is an area of very high rainforest. A long exploration hike will be highlighted by visiting one of the most impressive trees in all the Amazon.<BR>
