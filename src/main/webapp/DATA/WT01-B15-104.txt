Charts of the Dow Jones Industrial Average illustrate that the Dow is still in the middle of its trading range. Volume in all of the major US stock indices has been relatively light during the recent correction. Investments often decline on relatively low volume, but low volume also means that there is little panic selling. On a long term basis, the US markets are no bargain, but intermediate term, the Dow; S&P 500; New York Composite and the Nasdaq are rapidly heading for an oversold situation. This may lead to a tradable rally over the next few months. I apologize to you for calling a buy on the US small cap. markets last month. In retrospect, these markets were due for a short term correction. I still expect that the investment will make a profit within the next few months.<p>In the bond section, I mentioned that my goal on rising longer term US bond yields is 7.00 to 7.5%. Levesque Securities quantitative analysts just published a study identifying 7.5% US bond yield and 5.25% US T-Bill rate as the critical trigger for a major correction in the S and P 500. Levesque liken the present US bond vs equities scenario to Spring 1987. Remember what happened in September and October?<p>Finally, you thought that all of the nefarious market activities were limited to Canadian markets. We have recently seen the previously mentioned Cartaway (and First Marathon Securities), Timbuktu Gold and Oliver Reese.We have also read about a court case involving some Thunder Bay credit unions claiming substantial losses from trading<i> derivatives</i> with Nesbitt Burns. However, when we go to the US everything (as usual) is done on a bigger scale.<p>Mr.Henryk de Kwiatkowski is suing broker Bear Stearns for $300 million in investment losses. Mr. Kwiatkowski claims that Bear Stearns put his money into his currency trading account and traded it away, instead of putting it into a conservative trust fund for his children. Bear Stearns say that Mr. Kwiatkowski is a very sophisticated investor and is trying to shift the blame for his losses. There's a point to this tale. Over the years I have seen, or heard about many junior league versions of this story. Some brokers are unscrupulous, but probably an equal number of investors do stupid things and then expect someone else to accept financial responsibility. Equally tragic are the many situations where what the clients think was said, and what the advisor  thinks they heard, are very different stories. As an informed investor, you owe it to yourself to check your monthly statements regularly and periodically review your investment strategy with your advisor. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a><a href="charts/sp500.gif">SP 500<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="books.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>40</center></body></html>
