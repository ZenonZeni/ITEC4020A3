       THE NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION

     Position Statement on Medicinal Marijuana


The New York State Nurses Association Board of
Directors, at its meeting of June 7, 1995, endorsed
the Virginia State Nurses Association resolution
regarding Legalizing Marijuana for Medical Purposes
(see attached).

According to the Virginia Nurses Society on
Addictions, as a Schedule I drug, marijuana cannot be
used by patients or prescribed by health care
providers.  Marijuana has been found to be effective
in the treatment of glaucoma by reducing intraocular
pressure and in reducing nausea and vomiting caused
by chemotherapy.  Marijuana has also been effective
in stimulating the appetite of AIDS patients
suffering from the wasting syndrome, controlling
spasticity in spinal cord injury patients and in
controlling seizures for persons suffering from
epilepsy and for persons with multiple sclerosis.
Marijuana is remarkably non-toxic and the estimated
lethal dose is 20,000 to 40,000 times a normal dose.

In New York state, Marijuana cannot be used by
patients or prescribed by health care providers.
Public Health Law 3330 Schedule I Substances
states: "No prescription may be made or filled for
any controlled substance in schedule I nor may such
substance be possessed, distributed, dispensed or
administered except pursuant to Title III of this
Article."  Title III prohibits use of Schedule I
Substances for research, instructional activities and
chemical analysis relating to controlled substances
without having obtained a license and establishes the
provisions for obtaining the required license.

Thirty-six states, including Virginia, have
recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential and have
passed legislation supporting its medical use.  The
NYSNA Peer Assistance Committee agrees with the
intent and content of the resolution Legalizing
Marijuana for Medical Purposes.
