<h2><i>  What is Stress?</i></h2>


Stress is the "wear and tear" our bodies experience as we adjust to our continually changing environment; it has physical and emotional
effects on us and can create positive or negative feelings.  As a positive influence, stress can help compel us to action; it can result in a new awareness and an exciting new perspective.  As a negative influence, it can result in feelings of distrust, rejection, anger, and depression, which in turn can lead to health problems such as headaches, upset stomach, rashes, insomnia, ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.  With the death of a loved one, the birth of a child, a job promotion, or a new relationship, we experience stress as we readjust our lives.  In so adjusting to different circumstances, stress will help or hinder us depending on how we react to it.

<hr><h2><i>How Can I Eliminate Stress from My Life?</i></h2>           
As we have seen, positive stress adds anticipation and excitement to life, and we all thrive under a certain amount of stress. Deadlines, competitions, confrontations, and even our frustrations and sorrows add depth and enrichment to our lives.  Our goal is not to eliminate stress
but to learn how to manage it and how to use it to help us.  Insufficient stress acts as a depressant and may leave us feeling bored or dejected; on the other hand, excessive stressmay leave us feeling "tied up in knots." What we need to do is find the optimal level of stress which will individually motivate but not overwhelm each of us. <p>
<hr><h2><i>How Can I Tell What is Optimal Stress for Me?</i></h2>
There is no single level of stress that is optimal for all people.  We are all individual creatures with unique requirements.  As such, what is
distressing to one may be a joy to another.  And even when we agree that a particular event is distressing, we are likely to differ in our physiological and psychological responses to it.<p>
The person who loves to arbitrate disputes and moves from job site to job site would be stressed in a job which was stable and routine, whereas the person who thrives under stable conditions would very likely be stressed on a job wher duties were highly varied.  Also, our personal stress requirements and the amount which we can tolerate before we become distressed changes with our ages.<p>
It has been found that most illness is related to unrelieved stress. If you are experiencing stress symptoms, you have gone beyond your
optimal stress level; you need to reduce the stress in your life and/or improve your ability to manage it.<p>
<hr> <h2> <i>How Can I Manage Stress Better?</i></h2>
Identifying unrelieved stress and being aware of its effect on our lives is not sufficient for reducing its harmful effects.  Just as there are many sources of stress, there are many possibilities for its management.
However, all require work toward change: changing the source of stress and/or changing your reaction to it.  How do you proceed?<ol>
<b><li>Become aware of your stressors and your emotional and physical reactions.<br></b>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Notice your distress.  Don't ignore it.  Don't gloss over your  problems.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Determine what events distress you.  What are you telling yourself about meaning of these events?<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Determine how your body responds to the stress.  Do you become nervous or physically upset?  If so, in what specific ways?<p>
<b>
<li>Recognize what you can change.<br></b>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Can you change your stressors by avoiding or eliminating them completely?<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Can you reduce their intensity (manage them over a period of time instead of on a daily or weekly basis)?<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Can you shorten your exposure to stress (take a break, leave the physical premises)?
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Can you devote the time and energy necessary to making a change (goal setting, time management techniques, and delayed gratification strategies may be helpful here)?<p>

<b><li> Reduce the intensity of your emotional reactions to stress.<br></b>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    The stress reaction is triggered by your perception of danger...physical danger and/or emotional danger.  Are you viewing your stressors in exaggerated terms and/or taking a difficult situation and making it a disaster?<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">     Are you expecting to please everyone?<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">     Are you overreacting and viewing things as absolutely critecal and urgent?  Do you feel you must always prevail in every situation?<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">     Work at adopting more moderate views; try to see the stress as something you can cope with rather than something that overpowers you.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">     Try to temper your excess emotions.  Put the situation in perspective.  Do not labor on the negative aspects and the " what if's." <p>

<b><li>Learn to moderate your physical reacitons to stress.<br></b>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Slow, deep breathing will bring your heart rate and respiration back to normal.<br>  
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Relaxation techniques can reduce muscle tension.  Electronic biofeedback can help you gain voluntary control over such things as muscle tension, heart reate, and blood pressure.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Medications, when prescribed by a physician, can help in the short term in moderating your physical reactions.  However, they alone are not the answer.  Learning to moderate these reactions on your own is a preferable long-term solution.<p>

<b><li> Build your physical reserves.</b>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Exercise for cardiovascular fitness three to four times a week (moderate, prolonger rythmic exercise is best, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or jogging).<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Eat well-balanced, nutritious meals.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Maintain your ideal weight.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Avoid nicotine, excessive caffeine, and other stimulants.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Mix leisure with work.  Take breaks and get away when you can.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Get enough sleep.  Be as consistent with your sleep schedule as possible.<p>

<b><li>Maintain your emotional reserves.<br></b>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Develop some mutaully supportive friendships/relationships.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">    Pursue realistic goals which are meaningful to you, rather than goals others have for you that you do not share.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">     Expect some frustrations, failures, and sorrows.<br>
<dd><image align=top src="blue.gif">     Always be kind and gentle with yourself -- be a friend to yourself.</ol><hr width=75%>
