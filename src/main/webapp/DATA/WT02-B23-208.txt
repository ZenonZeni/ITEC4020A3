<H3>How To: Get a Job I Like, Keep My Job, Qualify for Promotion </H3>

<P><B>Edward Rothchild</B>, Esq., Cleveland, OH Don Bishop, Esq., Houston,
TX <BR>
<B>Dorothy Crawford,</B> Past President, Life Development Institute, Phoenix,

<B>Joe Swalwell</B>, Director, Downtown Topeka, Topeka, KS </P>

<P>Panel of business executives will discuss three basic concerns shared
by individuals in the workforce, especially individuals with learning disabilities.
Often in the world of work we don’t know what we are qualified to do. In
addition, many of us do not know the realities of presenting ourselves
in a way that makes us an appealing hire. On the job adults with learning
disabilities may lose ground because they may misunderstand what is expected
of them. The combination of misperceived expectations and a variety of
other issues may cause the adult with learning disabilities to lose their
job. What do we do to place ourselves in a likely position for promotion?
