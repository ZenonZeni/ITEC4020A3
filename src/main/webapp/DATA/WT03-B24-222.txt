<h1>Apollon: Facilitated DNA vaccines</h1></CENTER>

Some people just like to be "where it's at." Vincent Zurawski Jr. was the first researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital to work on monoclonal antibodies, and he was one of the co-founders of Centocor Inc. After 15 years working with MAbs, he was ready for a new challenge.<P>

Zurawski was responsible for the development of CNTO's diagnostic products, and at the end of his tenure there was working full time on cancer. But "this was the age of DNA and molecular genetics, and I wanted to get into that," he said.<P>

In 1992, Zurawski founded Apollon Inc., which is focused on pharmaceutical and vaccine products using "facilitated" DNA injection and delivery technology. The vaccines, delivered via intramuscular injection, contain DNA that encodes antigenic proteins. <P>

Following vaccination, foreign proteins are synthesized inside cells and then presented to the immune system through the major histocompatibility system in a way that stimulates both T cell and antibody responses. <P>

<CENTER><B>Facilitation</CENTER></B><P>

One advantage of DNA-based vaccines is that DNA is very pliable, and scientists can put a lot of genes into a vaccine, thus generating an immune response against several proteins simultaneously. But a critical issue is achieving the level of gene expression required for clinical utility. <P>

Apollon is using facilitating agents to enhance DNA uptake and gene expression. Its first generation facilitator is bupivacaine, a local anesthetic that produces higher levels of expression and immune response of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and antibodies. <P>

HIV and T cell lymphoma are its first targets. The company chose those indications because the seriousness of the diseases made it easy to get into the clinic quickly and probably will smooth the regulatory path. <P>

"Even if the risks in HIV are high, if you can prove it's safe, you can establish a hypothesis of safety for getting into other kinds of patients," Zurawski said. "Our next group of patients won't be HIV-positive, or have advanced cancer, but probably will have a non-life-threatening but difficult-to-treat disease."<P>

A $4.2 million NIH grant has given the company the ability to build a broader program that can evaluate different vaccine constructs and do more in-depth primate work. The company also hopes to announce shortly a major pharma company deal that will include HIV as one of the target vaccines.<P>

Another advantage of DNA vaccines, Zurawski said, is that the manufacturing technology can be used across its entire line of Genevax products. The plasmid vectors designed to carry the genes for different products are very similar, enabling generic methods of vaccine development and manufacture. <P>

<CENTER><B>Increased clinical opportunities</CENTER></B><P>

"Because it's all DNA, I don't have to redevelop the manufacturing process for every antigen I want to immunize against," said Zurawski. "That means we can get into the clinic with a number of different DNA constructs that code for different responses. That's an advantage in testing for HIV." <P>

For example, Apollon's first generation Genevax-HIV vaccine expresses a modified version of the gp160 envelope protein and an additional non-structural protein. Apollon also plans to look at a vaccine using a core protein (gag) polymerase construct.<P>

"We can mimic a live attenuated vaccine response with a generically manufactured product," Zurawski said. "We can control the pieces of the virus against which an immune response is directed. And we can already manufacture it in 30,000-dose batches."<P>

The manufacturing process uses fermentation and downstream processing including column chromatography -- both well-known processes. While the company has had to make the process reproducible and economically viable, it doesn't have the added burden of trying to develop a novel manufacturing technology.<P>

Apollon's first clinical trial, which started in June, is a dose-escalation Phase I/II study of Genevax-HIV in 15 HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts above 500. Doses will range from 30-300 µg. Apollon will start a similar trial in Switzerland before year-end.<P>

<CENTER><B>Small molecules</CENTER></B><P>

The company also plans to start a T cell lymphoma trial this year using a vaccine that encodes V-beta chains, part of the T cell receptor, on tumor cells. Similar T cell receptor-directed constructs may be useful in autoimmune diseases where immunization against a specific subset of disease-causing T cells is desired.<P>

The company has signed a license agreement with CNTO to exploit the Genevax technology in certain cancers.<P>

The Malvern, Penn., company also plans to develop small molecule drugs aimed at targets discovered by its molecular and cellular biologists.<P>

Apollon's small molecule program is focused on Vpr, a protein produced by HIV that works as part of a complex with an intracellular protein, rip-1, to render cells more susceptible to viral replication (see BioCentury, April 17, 1995). Vpr also has been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and to drive differentiation of cells. The company is working to identify drug candidates that mimic, inhibit or enhance Vpr's activity. (More on Vpr, see Clinicals, page B7.)<P>

Apollon has raised $14 million, and probably will do another private round before going public. The funding from the soon-to-be announced deal, together with other revenues, will enable Apollon to break even this year and in 1996 if it chooses to do so.<P>
