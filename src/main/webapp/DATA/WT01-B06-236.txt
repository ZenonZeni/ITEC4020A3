<H1><CENTER>California Smog Check II Errors and Facts</CENTER>
</H1>
Here's an easy-to-use menu of some of the questions most frequently asked
regarding Smog Check II, as answered by the California Bureau of Automotive Repairs (SEMA is not responsible for its accuracy or content.)<BR>
<HR>
<H4>The Background:</H4>
<BR>
In 1994, the Wilson Administration and the California State Legislature,
responding to the concerns of the more than 8,000 licensed smog-check stations
which make up the state's $480 million vehicle emissions test and repair
industry, entered into lengthy negotiations with the United States Environmental
Protection Agency regarding new federal mandates for vehicle emissions controls.
At the outset, the USEPA's position was that every vehicle owner in California
would be required to obtain a smog check at a centralized &quot;test only&quot;
center. The legislature convinced the USEPA to allow California to design
its own unique hybrid program, in which only about 15 percent of the vehicles
in the state will be sent to test-only facilities, with the remaining 85
percent continuing to obtain emissions tests at traditional test-and-repair
shops. The 15 percent of vehicles that will go to test-only/referee centers
are likely &quot;gross polluters&quot;--those vehicles with such high emissions
that they are responsible for at least half of all the vehicular smog in
the state.<BR>
<BR>
Although the hybrid program has the support of the majority of the vehicle
repair industry, including the California Service Station and Automotive
Repair Association, a tiny segment of the industry remains dissatisfied
with the compromise, and has spread information that is simply inaccurate.
As a result of this campaign, serious misstatements of fact regarding the
new Smog Check II program have recently been aired on late night radio call-in
shows, and in paid newspaper advertisements and anonymous flyers. Below
are some of the most often-stated mischaracterizations of the program, repeated
verbatim, followed by the relevant facts.<BR>
<BR>
Here are some of the errors and facts, arranged in an easy-to-read menu,
with hyperlinks to the actual solutions:<BR>

<A NAME="central"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>The new Smog Check II program is a 'central smog testing program.'&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>As noted in the introduction, California's Enhanced Smog Check II
program, is not a centralized program. As a result of the state legislature's
successful negotiations with the USEPA, we instead created a unique hybrid
program in which an estimated 15 percent of the state's vehicles are tested
at a test-only/referee center, and the remainder - a full 85 percent - still
obtain tests at traditional privately-operated neighborhood repair shops
and service stations.<BR>
<A NAME="sixty"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B> &quot;Sixty percent of vehicles will fail the test.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>While it is true that more vehicles will fail than have in the past
(because the new, more sophisticated equipment can now test for an additional
highly toxic pollutant, NOx, as well as more accurately gauge other emissions),
the rate of failure will not be anything near 60 percent. No more than about
30 percent are expected to fail the test, and only half of those cars --
roughly 15 percent of the cars in the state -- are expected to be found
to have such high emissions that they are classified as gross polluters.<BR>
<A NAME="fail"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;If you fail the test, your car will be confiscated.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>   The Smog Check II program does not include a provision for vehicle
confiscation. In fact, the new program does not include any new compliance
enforcement measures, but instead relies solely on existing state law. Under
current California law, the Department of Motor Vehicles will not issue
a registration renewal to a vehicle that fails an emission test. Typically,
the California Highway Patrol and local law enforcement agencies issue citations
to motorists who do not comply with registration requirements.<BR>
<A NAME="crushed"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;If your car is confiscated, it will be crushed.&quot;  <BR>
<B>Fact: </B>The Smog Check II program never included a provision for involuntary
vehicle scrappage. The legislature did establish a mechanism for a buy-back
program as an option available to the owners of vehicles that failed the
test, and who wished to participate in the program. However, it was envisioned
that revenues for the buy-back program, and for a repair-assistance program,
would be raised through a $39 fee that new-car buyers would pay in order
to be allowed to skip their first smog check, due 2 years after their
initial purchase. The program received limited contributions and is still
under development.<BR>
<A NAME="state"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;The state will run the test-only centers.&quot;  <BR>
<B>Fact: </B>The state will award a legally required minimum of two contracts through
a competitive bid process to private industry to operate test-only/referee
centers, much as it currently contracts for existing referee stations.<BR>
<A NAME="thirty"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>Thirty percent of all vehicles will have to go to test-only centers.<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>At least for the first few years, no more than 15 percent of all the
vehicles in any area will be called into a test-only/referee center for
the biennial test. Gross polluters, once fixed, will be required to return
annually for 2 years to the same centers.<BR>
<A NAME="hours"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Everyone who goes to a test-only center will have to wait in
line for hours.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>That would have been the case if California had agreed to the USEPA's
original demands, which would have meant that all the state's motorists would
have to have their car tested at a test-only facility. Under the hybrid
program, however, only 15 percent of the cars will be sent to the test-only/referee
network. Although the test-only/referee center contracts have not yet been
awarded, two criteria for awarding the contract are consumer convenience
and short wait times.<BR>
<A NAME="pollution"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Cars are not a major source of pollution.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>Vehicles are the source of at least half of all the smog in California.<BR>
<A NAME="gross"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Gross polluters are not a major source of pollution...this
program will not clean the air.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>Gross polluters, although they comprise only about 15 percent of the
entire vehicle fleet, are responsible for half the state's vehicular pollution:
that is, a full quarter of California's smog. The Rand Corporation has severely
criticized California's old smog-check program for failing to require the
repair of gross polluters which, according to a Rand senior policy analyst,
was &quot;a failure because it didn't concentrate on the 5 to 10 percent
of cars that are the highest polluting.&quot; Requiring emissions-related
repairs for gross polluters will make significant strides in cleaning the
air.<BR>
<A NAME="immediately"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B> &quot;Gross polluters must be immediately repaired...at any cost.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>  Confirmed gross-polluting vehicles must be repaired and brought
below gross-polluter levels. After that, if the vehicle still fails its
smog test, there are waivers and extensions available to give motorists
time to same money for the needed repairs. But within 2 years, vehicles
will need to be repaired to the required standard.<BR>
<A NAME="return"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Once identified as a gross polluter, a car must return to a
test-only center every year as long as it is on the road.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>By statute, identified gross polluters may be required to return to
a test-only/referee center every year for 2 years.<BR>
<A NAME="factories"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B> &quot;The state wants to crush your car so it can sell emissions
credits to big factories.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>There is not yet a state scrap program developed. However, the state
program will focus solely on mobile source emissions reduction credits,
which are not available to stationary sources for swapping. As previously
stated, participation in any scrap program will be voluntary.<BR>
<A NAME="morepollution"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B> &quot;Factories are the source of more pollution than cars are.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B> Most scientists agree that fixed-point pollution has been reduced
as much as possible, leaving vehicles as the most significant source of
smog that can be reduced through more effective controls.<BR>
<A NAME="centralizedprograms"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;A major company that (operates &quot;centralized programs&quot;)
has greased a lot of politicians will have a monopoly in supplying
these tests.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>  There will not be a monopoly. The law requires a minimum of two
test-only contracts, and the state will likely let three contracts. Six
different companies currently manufacture dynamometers.<BR>
<A NAME="seventy"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Only 70 percent of cars, or fewer, can be tested in a few remaining
local shops...&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B> A minimum of 85 percent of the vehicles will continue to be tested at local
neighborhood repair shops, the majority of which are expected to continue
as licensed smog-check stations under the new program.<BR>
<A NAME="hundreddollars"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Tests could cost up to $100.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>The cost of smog tests, as always, will be market-driven. Although
prices are likely to rise, it is highly unlikely that they will increase
to $100.<BR>
<A NAME="video"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;Remote-sensor vans will video everyone's license plates and
send citations.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B> Remote sensing devices (RSDs) will identify only likely gross polluters.
Subsequent notices sent to vehicle owners will not be citations, but will
merely require confirmatory smog tests. Those vehicles confirmed as gross
polluters will then be required to be repaired. This ensures that vehicles
once repaired stay repaired and thus reduce pollution. Remote sensing is
required in the hybrid system negotiated with, and approved by, the USEPA.<BR>
<A NAME="saferair"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>&quot;This is not about achieving safer air.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B> Smog Check II, by identifying those few vehicles responsible for
most of the pollution that comes from car exhausts, and by requiring everyone
to take personal responsibility for keeping their vehicles properly maintained,
will clean as much as 25 percent of the existing pollution from our air.<BR>
<A NAME="fed"></A>
<BR>
<B>Error: </B>The Federal Government forced California to comply with this program...and your California legislators capitulated.&quot;<BR>
<B>Fact: </B>  California did not adopt the 100-percent test-only program preferred
by the federal government. Far from capitulating, a bipartisan majority
of California's state legislature, along with the Wilson administration,
worked for many months to create a program designed to achieve three major
goals: protect small business by preserving the $480 million smog-check
industry; protect the majority of Californians from unnecessary inconvenience;
and the health of all Californians by making our air significantly cleaner.<BR>
