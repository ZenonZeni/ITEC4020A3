<H2>What It All Means </H2>

<P>
This document outlines the objectives, strategy, findings and
limitations of a continent-wide assessment of landcover disturbance
undertaken by CSIRO staff on behalf of the Biodiversity Unit of
DEST.
<P>
The assessment had two objectives: to use contemporary (1990-1992)
satellite image data to map the type, severity and extent of landcover
disturbance across the continent; and to integrate these data
with existing understanding to explore the implications of the
landcover disturbance for biotic impoverishment, the loss of biodiversity.
<P>
In the formulation of these two goals, it was argued that landcover
is a tangible surrogate for habitat for all terrestrial life,
and that disturbed landcover represents a change in habitat suitability
that was usually a deleterious change.
<P>
The principal findings were three. First, within the intensive
landuse zone of the continent, we found that as of 1990, a total
of 1, 550, 000 km2 of forests and woodlands have been cleared
or thinned over the preceding 200 years. This represents 52% of
this landuse zone and 20% of the entire continent.
<P>
These figures are unexpectedly high, but nevertheless plausible.
Assuming a worst-case error analysis, the minimum figure was at
least 1, 240, 000 km2. Either of these two values revise the current
estimates of clearing upwards. Within this landuse zone, individual
landcover types have levels of clearing that range between 30%
and 99%, with an overall mean value of 47%. Almost everywhere
within this landuse zone, the degree of fragmentation of the remaining
landcover was high.
<P>
Second, within the remaining 4, 708, 000 km2 of the continent,
the extensive landuse zone, 37% of the continental area was assessed
to be slightly disturbed, 9% was substantially disturbed, with
15% interpreted as significantly disturbed. This distribution
of disturbance more strongly reflects the resilience of different
landcover types than the standard of pastoral management.
<P>
Combining these figures indicates that more than one third (35%)
of the continent was significantly disturbed out of the total
81% that was subject to active landuse. The remainder was allocated
to unused (12%) or conservation reserves (7%). Thus almost half
of the landcover subject to landuse was significantly disturbed.
A global comparison indicates that Australasia and South America
have equal lowest proportions of significantly disturbed landcover
(38%), with Europe containing the highest (86%).
<P>
While the landscapes of Australia are not as disturbed as those
of Europe, the extent of clearing is pervasive. The view from
space of the agricultural areas of this continent reveals the
little native vegetation that is left with which to conserve the
remnant biodiversity for the future.
<P>
By comparison, in the extensive landuse zone, the Australian Outback,
the prospect is far less daunting. Though disturbed, the landcover
remains relatively intact, and the standard of land management
can always be improved.
<P>
Considered together, the disturbance of clearing and grazing has
been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of the process
of biotic erosion; perhaps the most significant driver. The landcovers
that have been most disturbed were the richest country; those
that enjoy the highest rainfall and therefore have the highest
productivity. Between them, the landuses of agriculture and pastoralism
have 'taken the eyes of the land'. While we do not yet have the
quantitative functional relationships to support this conclusion,
we speculate that it must be so. The case studies, which cover
the bulk of the continent, support this view.
<P>
Third, by examining the protection offered by the different tenure
types across the continent, we conclude that the vulnerability
to future disturbance is high for all landcover types. Looking
to the future from the landscapes of today, it is evident that
conservation management by means of tenure protection, ie the
dedication of land in reserves or parks to preserve biodiversity,
is a limited strategy. Effective, off-park conservation strategies
are required to integrate the conservation of biodiversity with
other present and future landuses.
<P>
While it will be difficult, the broad scale integration of conservation
and landuse in the future is possible. Landuse is a social activity
and is therefore manageable by social means. Unfortunately, one
significant threat to the success of future conservation efforts
remains. Analysis of the distribution of four feral species (rabbit,
cat, fox, pig) thought to be significant drivers of biotic erosion
suggests that their presence exacerbates the effects of landcover
disturbance. While cats were mostly evenly distributed across
the continent, the highest densities of rabbits, foxes and pigs
coincide with the most severe and extensive landcover disturbance,
clearing.
<P>
The acceptance of the findings presented here is largely determined
by the credibility of the interpretation of landcover disturbance
from satellite and its linkage with biodiversity. The interpretation
that was finally used was one of many that were exhaustively tested
during this project. We strove to minimise errors of both commission
and omission, and where possible, we tested our findings against
other estimates to indicate the direction and magnitude of error.
Nonetheless, uncertainty remains; most critically with the assessment
of clearing. .
<P>
The results are presented in a pragmatic spirit of applied scientific
research - to present the best understanding possible at this
time. This was the same spirit and intent that motivated the publication
of the Atlas of Australian Resources series; in particular, the
most recent Vegetation volume (AUSLIG 1990). Australia is, as
the result of considerable past efforts, a well-mapped continent.
This raft of resource knowledge supports not only government policies
but also public debate about those policies. We hope that this
compact disk, and its summary in printed format, Graetz et al,
(1995), will also contribute to a better understanding of the
Australian continent.<HR>
