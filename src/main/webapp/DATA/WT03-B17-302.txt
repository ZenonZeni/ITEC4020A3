<PRE><STRONG><H3>METHODS OF COMPOSTING.    30-60 day method</H3></STRONG>
<STRONG><H4>1st Day.</H4></STRONG>
     First,  in center place a large pile of animal manure such as horse
or  cow  or  rabbit or Llama pellets. The pile should be about  2  feet
high.  Water  lightly.   Place the following  layers:  Layer  in  plant
waste(hay,  grass clippings,leaves etc). Use your  own grass clippings,
and   leaves  to  make sure toxins are low (or ask  if  using  someones
else's  grass clippings). Sprinkle a thin layer of either alfalfa  meal,
nature  meal or composted manure (do not use cat or dog manure)  or  any
nitrogen  rich material. Spray this with a liquid seaweed mixture.  You
can  use Superseaweed™ for this as it makes a good compost starter. Add
1  cup Nitron A-35, or Agrigro or any other natural product. Add a 2 inch
layer  of  rock  dust covering with a 2 inch layer of top soil.  Water  to
moisten.   Superseaweed™ is available at:  The Invisible Gardener  Inc.
Other  Compost  Starters are available at the following outlets:   A-35
Nitron  Industries, Inc; they make various compost starters and compost
bins. Nitron A35,  Necessary Trading Company; a great source of compost
starters  and  soil  thermometer,  Aerators  and  many  other   organic
products, Peaceful Valley Farm Supply;  another good source of  compost
starters, thermometers. and  various organic materials, Gardens Alive!;
they carry many composting products, Mellingers, Inc; they carry a  big
line  of  compost starters, organic materials etc. See Also Arbico  for
composting  supplies.  When you write to these  folks,  tell  them  the
Invisible Gardener sent you!.

<STRONG><H4>2nd Day</H4></STRONG>
     1 inch  layer plant waste or kitchen wastes, 1 inch layer alfalfa  meal,
water  to  moisten,  1 inch layer kelpmeal or dried  seaweed,   2 inch  layer
manure(rabbit,goat,Llama pellets), 2 inch layer plant  waste (leaves,  pine
needles),  1inch  layer  minerals  (rock  dust  or  granite,  gypsum,  or
greensand,oyster shell), 2 inch layer manure cover, 1 inch  layer  top  soil,
water  to  moisten, 1 inch layer rock dust (a good fertilizer and anti  fly
dust),  1 inch  layer  kelpmeal.  Spray with  a  liquid  seaweed  such  as
Superseaweed™. Cover with a clear plastic or tarp.

<STRONG><H4>3rd day</H4></STRONG>
     Allow to sit.
<STRONG><H4>4th day</H4></STRONG>
     Allow  to  sit,  take  temp (with  soil  thermometer),  leave  pile
covered,  add  a 1 inch layer of rock dust covering 1inch layer  top  soil,
water to moisten.
<STRONG><H4>5th Day</H4></STRONG>
     Allow to sit
<STRONG><H4>6th day</H4></STRONG>
     Take temp, temp should be rising every day till reaches 160 F. The
temp may go higher but should stop no higher then 180 degrees F. If the
temp does continue to rise add water to cool down.
<STRONG><H4>7th day</H4></STRONG>
       Allow to sit, check temp
<STRONG><H4>8th day</H4></STRONG>
     Uncover  pile and allow to sit open for a day, check  temp,  check
for odors (should smell of ammonia)
<STRONG><H4>9th Day</H4></STRONG>
     Turn  pile  over,  spraying with the liquid  seaweed  as  you  go,
turning  the pile: This is done by one of several methods...the easiest
being using a front end loader to turn the pile over; or use the shovel
technique.  The main idea is to turn the pile over in such a  way  that
you  are turning the layers together except for the center of the pile.
The easiest way to do this is the volcano method.

<STRONG><H3>The Volcano method.</H3></STRONG>
     This  is  when you dig into the center of the pile making it  look
like  a  volcano has just erupted, then you throw everything back  into
the  center  of the pile mixing it up and watering lightly as  you  go.
Cover the pile with clear plastic.

The clear plastic has several functions:
     1:  It  solarizes  the  compost destroying  harmful  bacteria   2:
solarization  breaks down various inorganic compounds  and  allows  for
their  disposal. 3: the clear plastic is a good control  against  flies
laying  eggs  in  your compost pile. The plastic also protects  against
rain.
<STRONG><H4>Day 10-15:</H4></STRONG>
     Allow  to  sit, Check temp every two days, if not hot  enough  add
nitrogen rich materials such as bloodmeal, if too hot add water to cool
down then add more humus or soil to increase nitrogen:carbon ratio.
<STRONG><H4>Day 16:</H4></STRONG>
     Uncover  pile,check temp, turn pile as described before . add  1lb
alfalfa meal, 1lb cottonseedmeal use only organic, 5lbs rock dust, 5lbs
kelpmeal, 1 lb epson salts,1 lb greensand. Stir together in bucket  and
sprinkle a thin layer as you turn over pile. Then spray liquid seaweed.
The  pile should be turned over completely, making sure pile is not too
wet  (soaky)  and  not,  dry  but moist. Cover  pile  with  plastic  if
possible.
<STRONG><H4>Day 17-21.</H4></STRONG>
     Allow  to  sit,checking temp every three days. Keep notes  on  the
temp  and compare. Is it still rising or is it falling? The temp should
continue  to  rise until it reaches 160 or higher. Then the  temp  will
level off. At the point where the temp starts to drop that is the  time
to  turn  the  pile over again. This usually happens around  the  20-30
day,depending on the weather.
<STRONG><H4>Day 22nd</H4></STRONG>
  Uncover  pile  and turn over while spraying with the liquid  seaweed.
     After this the plastic cover is not needed.
<STRONG><H4>Day 23-30</H4></STRONG>
  Allow  to sit watering lightly to keep moist. Make sure to spray with
     a liquid seaweed mixture.
<STRONG><H4>Day 31:</H4></STRONG>
     Turn  pile over lightly, (aerate the pile by turning over  the  top
layers).
<STRONG><H4>Day 32-45:</H4></STRONG>
     Allow to sit checking the temp every 4 days.
<STRONG><H4>Day 46:</H4></STRONG>
     Turn pile over while spraying with liquid seaweed mixture
<STRONG><H4>Day 47-60:</H4></STRONG>
       Allow  pile  to  sit , water once every three days.  Check  temp
  every time before watering.
Your compost is ready!!
