Dear Mr. Olson: 
 
The Department of General Services has reserved for your use the West 
steps of the State Capitol for a rally of Iowans for Medical Marijuana to 
be held on Sunday, August 5, 1995 beginning at Noon until 2:00 p.m.  I 
appreciate your appointing two marshalls, yourself and John Hartog 
(515/262-4660) to assist the 50 - 100 people expected to attend the 
event. 
 
I understand that your organization will again provide your own security 
arrangements as well as public address system.  We can offer you the use 
of the 110 volt electrical outlet located at the base of the light post 
immediately east of the Lincoln and Tad statue.  There are no charges for 
the use of the State Capitol grounds or electricity. 
 
Please remember no signs can be hung from the building, lamp posts or 
trees but signs carried by a single individual are acceptable.  I 
appreciate the efforts outlined in your letter to restrict the use of 
illegal drugs on the complex.  Capitol Police will be informed that two 
participants, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</A> and Barbara Douglas are authorized to use 
marijuana by the federal government as well as the Iowa Board of Pharmacy 
Examiners. 
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 242-5120. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dean Crocker
