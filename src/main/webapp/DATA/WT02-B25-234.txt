Part II Conference</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>





	<P>AMI of Maryland’s "Putting Care Into Managed Care" Part II, a joint conference with On Our Own of Maryland, was held at the Bon Secours Conference Center on October 25, 1996. Over 70 family members, providers and consumers participated in this one-day educational update on the status of Medicaid Reform in Maryland.<P>

<H4>Program Highlights</H4>

	<P>As part of the Keynote Address on Medicaid Reform and the New Public Mental Health System, Barbara Shipnuck, Deputy Secretary for Health Care Policy, Finance and Regulation, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), acknowledged that there may be a possible delay in  enrollment in the new system. The current start-up date of January 1, 1997 may be delayed as much as 30 days. In addition, Deputy Secretary Shipnuck announced that DHMH is expecting a letter of acceptance for the 1115 Waiver from the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) any day now and that will make Maryland the fastest state to gain approval. </P>
	<P>Dr. Stuart Silver, Director,  Mental Hygiene Administration, also part of the Keynote Address, provided an update on the role of the Administrative Service Organization (ASO). He outlined the five services that the ASO will provide: Access, Utilization and Management Systems, Management Information Service, Claim Services and Evaluation (includes Outcomes, Satisfaction, Clinical Quality, Provider Information and ASO Performance).</P>
 	<P>Following the Keynote Address, a panel consisting of: Lori Doyle, Director of Public Policy, Maryland Association of Psychiatric Support Services; Marcia Pines, Chair, Public Policy/Government Relations, AMI of Maryland; Frank Sullivan, Director, Anne Arundel County Mental Health Agency; and Laura Van Tosh, Coordinator, Consumer Managed Care Network; responded to and questioned Ms. Shipnuck and Dr. Silver about the new  Public Mental Health System.</P>
	<P>In the afternoon, Elizabeth Edgar, State Relations Associate, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and Laura Van Tosh, compared Maryland’s   Medicaid Reform Plans to similar plans in other states. This was followed by participants forming a workgroup to discuss individual concerns, questions and develop possible topics for further training.</P>
<H4>1115 Medicaid Waiver Update</H4>

<UL>

<LI>The responses to the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Administrative Service Organization (ASO) for Maryland’s Public Health System are being reviewed. 
<LI>On October 17, 1996, the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (DHMH) sponsored a Vendors Fair at the Columbia Inn, for managed care organizations (MCO’s) and current providers.

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



	<P>The Medicaid Waiver bill SB 750 passed the Maryland General Assembly just before it came to a close in April, 1996.  AMI members can expect that it will take the next several months to understand just how it will impact consumers on Medicaid and their families.  We will update members as we learn additional information.</P>

	<P>New insights were provided by Dr. Wasserman, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental health at a meeting sponsored by AMI of Maryland and On Our Own of Maryland on April 30th.  Dr. Wasserman said there is a general consensus across the country that Medicaid and Medicare must be reduced.  There is only a question of how and when.  Medicaid has been expanding at an unacceptable 9% per year.  There are no really good choices.  We must either limit services, limit enrollment, or limit fees to providers.</P>
	<P>The goals of the 1115 Medicaid Waiver are to improve access and contain costs through the use of Managed Care.  One third of Medicaid recipients are already in Managed Care.</P>
	<P>Oscar Morgan, Deputy Director of the Mental Hygiene Administration, explained how Managed care would work for people with mental illnesses:</P>
	
<OL>
<LI>All individuals on Medicaid will be assigned a primary care provider.  They will all be assessed for mental health needs.  The primary care provider will treat those that they can.
<LI>If the mental health problem is severe, they will be referred to the Core Service Agency (CSAs) in their county which will hook them up with a mental health provider.  Medicaid and Grant dollars will be given to the CSAs.  There will be 24-hour availability.
<LI> The number of providers will expand so there will be choices.
<LI>There will be a seamless bridge between hospital and community.
<LI>Outcome measures will be developed.  Families and consumers will be involved.  Report cards may be used to note:  Who are getting services?  How good are the outcomes?  If not good, why not?  There will also be a grievance system in place.
<LI>Advisory boards must be 50% families or consumers.
<LI>All Managed Care Organizations will be approved by the Mental Hygiene Administration.

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

   In response to requests from AMI of Maryland members, Maryland State Senator Norman R. Stone introduced SB 157 in the 1996 Legislative Session.  The bill is designed to make access to necessary medical information easier for family members or persons who serve in a caregiver capacity for persons who have mental illnesses/brain disorders.  Bette Stewart and Janet Edelman worked with Senator Stone to develop the bill.  The bill was deferred from the regular session and referred to the 1996 Summer Study Session for further consideration.
   A public hearing is scheduled for September 24, 1996 at 1:00pm in Annapolis before the Senate Economic and Environmental Matters Committee with Senator Paula C. Hollinger presiding.  AMI of Maryland is preparing for the hearing and developing talking points to complement the position paper on confidentiality that was published in the winter issue of this newsletter.  If any AMI members have experiences relating to the lack of access to information that has effected the care of their relatives, please let the AMI of Maryland office know as soon as possible.  Additional copies of the bill are available at AMI of MD office: (410)467-7100.</P>

<P>  
   The legislative session closed on April 10.  Below is a listing of results of legislation followed by
AMI of MD, lead by Government Relations Chairperson, Janet Edelman.   A special thank you to Affiliate
Presidents and all members who wrote letters and contacted your legislators this session.  </P>

 <P>    Our big victory was the passage of  SB750, Managed Care and Medicaid Reform Proposal which
contained the wording that we advocated regarding specialty mental health services.  Noteworthy efforts in
Annapolis were conducted by Joe Friend, Phil Livingstone, Marcia Pines and Art Tate during this process. 
From the local Affiliates, over 300 contacts were made to assist the passage of this bill.  Thank you!!<P>

<P>Senate Bill 157, Mental Health Records- Disclosure to Primary Caregivers, the bill submitted by Senator Norman Stone on behalf of family members, was referred to interim study.  Meetings will be held this year to discuss the contents of this bill and hopefully a compromise will be reached.  The intent of this bill was to put in place a process to allow disclosure of limited mental health information to primary caregivers.</P>

  <P>   Marcia Pines will take the helm as the Chairperson of Public Policy/Government Relations for the
1996-97 year.  If anyone is interested in participating, the group is planning to meet year-round to examine
issues, develop AMI of Maryland position papers, and conduct other activities to influence policy.  Please
contact the AMI of MD office at (410) 467-7100 or e-mail at Amimd@aol.com.<P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>     Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid still pose serious
threats for the elderly.  If Medicaid becomes a block
grant, Maryland's programs for non-nursing home
services are likely to end.  These "Medi-Grant" block
grants would reduce funds by 134 billion over seven years. 
Medicaid would no longer be required to pay the
medicare premiums of low income individuals.  Nursing
homes could require patients under "Medi-Grant" to
make additional payments.</P>

<P> 
    Home and Community-based care would also be
threatened.  These service providers cannot compete
politically with the powerful nursing home industry.  In
addition, there is a real possibility that adult children
could be held financially responsible for the long term
care of a parent.</P>

   <P>  The Older Americans Act which offers an array
of services to older persons has not been re-authorized as
yet.  This Act supports the Senior Care System, meal
programs, and housing and support services.</P>

 <P>    Congress wants to gut regulations for long term
care.  These regulations were designed for the comfort
and safety of elderly persons in nursing homes.</P>

  <P>   Operation Restore Trust is an effort from the
White House to stop fraud and abuse in Medicare.  Five
states are funded for an experimental program in ending
Medicare fraud.  If you know of abuse, call 1-800-HHS-
TIPS to report it.</P>

 <P>    Virginia Thomas, former Maryland Delegate,
now working on the Medicaid Waiver indicated at the
United Seniors meeting in Annapolis that there will be a
second phase to this endeavor which will address long
term care and ways to keep people out of institutions. 
This effort will begin in November.  The goal will be to
integrate acute and long term care.</P>
