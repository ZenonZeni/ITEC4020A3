Subject: Re: Q&amp;A on the RSA/Cylink legal dispute<br>
<p>
IANAL, but after a couple of hours of slogging through the arbitration<br>
report, here's my layman's interpretation:<br>
<p>
-       Either both sides or neither side breached the agreement forming PKP<br>
        (the arbitrators went out their way to avoid assigning blame)<br>
<p>
-       PKP is dissolved by mutual agreement.<br>
<p>
-       Cylink maintains control of the Stanford patents (Hellman-Merkle,<br>
        Diffie-Hellman [others (?)])<br>
<p>
-       RSA maintains control of the MIT patents (RSA [others])<br>
<p>
-       It isn't clear to me whether Cylink maintained the right to use<br>
        the RSA software in creating a product.  The arbitration order<br>
        was as clear as mud on this point.  It is clearer that they<br>
        maintained the right to *use the patented technology* covered by<br>
        the MIT patents in the creation of a product.  In either case,<br>
        it appears that their right does not extend to the point where<br>
        they can sublicense the technology -- so it looks to me like<br>
        Cylink can't sell you an RSA toolkit, for instance.<br>
<p>
-       RSA has no rights to license the Stanford patents.<br>
<p>
<p>
RSA's FAQ (via baldwin@rsa.com) writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      A. The Panel's ruling was very specific. Everything it said about third</i><br>
<i>&gt;      parties, including RSA customers who use software, refers to their need</i><br>
<i>&gt;      for patent licenses. If you bought software from RSA and RSA itself had</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the rights to make that software and license it to you, you don't need</i><br>
<i>&gt;      a separate patent license; rights to the patents came with the product.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      The Ruling also states, "RSA has a right to license its software."</i><br>
<p>
This answer is evasive.  RSA didn't give the complete sentence from the<br>
arbitration panel's order.  It is:<br>
<p>
    "Therefore, after April 6, 1990, RSA has a right to license its<br>
    (RSA's) software to third-parties but does not have the right to<br>
    license such third-parties under the Stanford patents."<br>
<p>
So, their answer appears to be correct only if the RSA software doesn't<br>
infringe the Stanford patents.  And that seems to be a matter of opinion.<br>
Furthermore, the next sentence in the order continues:<br>
<p>
    "To the extent RSA provides code to third-parties which causes an<br>
    infringement of a valid and enforceable claim of the Stanford patents,<br>
    assuming the third party is not separately licensed under the Stanford<br>
    patent [sic], nothing in this order shall prevent Cylink from pursuing<br>
    its rights under the Stanford patents against such third party."<br>
<p>
<p>
That's pretty clear to me folks, but make your own judgements.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;                                                                         If</i><br>
<i>&gt;      you're using RSA's software -you didn't write your own- you don't need</i><br>
<i>&gt;      a separate patent license under either the MIT or Stanford patents.</i><br>
<p>
Again, only to the extent that you're not infringing the Stanford patents.<br>
<p>
<p>
So, pay your nickel, take your chances.  Does RSA's software infringe<br>
the Stanford patents?<br>
<p>
(Of course these are my opinions, not my company's)<br>
