ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS

Happy New Year to all! When the clock changes, we check our smoke
detectors; when the year changes, we check our BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT
mailing labels! If yours indicates a January expiration date, renew now!
Call, write, e-mail, or fax us with your renewal. We have some great plans
for 1996--you won't want to miss out.

The ALERT staff spent many hours during 1995 redesigning BUSINESS
INFORMATION ALERT. We hope the changes you see will permit easier reading
and access. Besides our new format, you'll notice that Marydee Ojala's
regular two columns are now one: "News and Trends." This change allows her
the flexibility to address those issues of most importance each month. In
addition to our regular articles and columns, we plan to bring you library,
publisher, and vendor profiles. If you work in or know of a library that
functions in an atypical manner, and would like to share your experiences
with our readers, please contact us. If there is a vendor or publisher you
want to know more about, let us know--maybe others are curious.

This month's feature article by Cynthia Shockley came about from a
discussion on the BUSLIB listserv. Cynthia had posted a question asking how
librarians are getting involved in setting Internet policy. For this
article she compiled some of the responses and expanded them into a
practical discussion of how we can organize our involvement in Internet
use, policy, and training. I'm sure you'll use this article--if not now,
then very soon.

Associate Editor

Risk or Reward: Setting Your Organization's Internet Policy
by Cynthia Shockley

Last year Internet use doubled, as it has every year since 1988. At the
same time, use of the Internet's graphical interface, the World Wide Web,
grew almost twenty-fold. No one knows exactly how many people are out there
creating, maintaining, and using Internet sites, but an October 1994
estimate by Internet analyst John Quartermain puts the number at 13.5
million.

One of the leading search sites, Lycos, ran 30 million searches in October
1995. Estimates are that this number will grow to 100 million searches per
month by June 1996. Lycos has cataloged more than 9.3 million Internet site
addresses, called URLs. Given this experience, Lycos began a television
campaign in November 1995 advertising itself as "The Catalog of the
Internet."

Internet content--everything from the text of classical literature to
underground music--is exploding even more spectacularly. Without any
prospect of profit, thousands of individuals have put millions of pages
online--everything from complete libraries of technical information to day-
by-day personal diaries.

How does this dynamic growth impact the library community?

Have you been asked by your organization to develop Internet policies and
procedures? Are you doing the training for your organization? Are you a
Webmaster or on the Webmaster's team?

When such a question was posed on the BUSLIB listserv, some interesting
dialog took place. "You really hit a hot button with that question" replied
a student enrolled in an MLS program. "The one thing that the faculty has
attempted to drill into our heads is that librarians cannot sit and wait
for someone to ask their opinions! We have to get in there and form policy
and procedures or someday we will wake up and our jobs will be gone! The
MIS department (as well as others) will be all too happy to take over if we
don't insist that we be included right from the beginning!"

As Barbara Beverly, Director of Library Services for the New York State
Department of Economic Development, observed "I intend to promote library
access as much as possible since we are being seen as the place to go . . .
however, MIS and other departments don't want to provide much Internet
access because they see it as a big time waster (which it can be). But how
else can people learn?"

How can librarians step into the breach?

How aggressive should librarians be in claiming the Internet as their
domain? The Internet is an information utility and, as such, it is best
understood by us. If we don't participate, others--those less trained in
the art of cataloging, searching, and retrieval who are delving into the
world of electronic resources--will take the job. In that case, librarians
will run the risk of losing more of their organization's info-business
market share (and, eventually their jobs).

=======================================
Step 1: Develop Internet Use Guidelines

Your organization should have an Internet policy and procedures for its use
so that your fellow employees will know what the boundaries are as they use
the Internet. One major U.S. corporation published its Internet use
guidelines on its Web site for its employees. The topics covered are
specific and follow common sense. For example:

* behavior resulting in disciplinary action (e.g., sending threatening
messages);

* behavior considered prudent and good manners (e.g., include a signature
with an e-mail message reply);

* behavior as a participant on listservs and newsgroups (e.g., actively
disclaim that you are speaking for the company and obey copyright laws);
and

* behavior for using file transfer protocols (e.g., don't ftp during prime
business hours).

As noted in the third item, obeying copyright laws is a very critical rule
that should have clear direction from you as a librarian. The library
community is actively working on how the letter and spirit of the copyright
law translate into applications in an electronic, networked environment. We
should be there to guide our organizations in developing their policy
statements with respect to copyright laws. Your fellow employees should
know that their seemingly innocent acts of copying downloaded material are
often serious violations of copyright laws.

You also may want to develop guidelines for patrons using the Internet
while in the library. Glen Whitmill of the New Castle-Henry County Public
Library System posted an e-mail message on a library listserv encouraging
librarians to comment and provide input on his library's "Computer Usage
Policy" draft. (The URL is http://www.nchcpl.lib.in.us/Library/LibraryInfo
/InternetPolicy.html.) This policy covers use by both staff and patrons of
the Internet. Guidelines are straightforward and practical and require that
a patron sign a limitation of liability statement to help protect the
library.

====================================================
Step 2: Volunteer to Train Employees on Internet Use

We librarians are guides to information. The more information there is, the
more your organization needs a guide. As described above, the material that
resides on the Internet is growing at a phenomenal rate.

For example, one librarian responding to the listserv query reported that
"we started out providing access to the Internet in our nonprofit
organization by providing individuals with dial-access accounts . . . later
we installed our headquarters node and made it an item in the library's
budget. Computer Services did not want to do it, so we did. Computer
Services did participate in selecting a provider and oversaw all the work
of installing the hardware and software. We agreed between us that the
library would be responsible for training users."

We are comfortable instructing individuals on how to identify, search, and
access information resources and should continue that role. Another
librarian serving a scientific community observed "one thing was readily
apparent and that was 'Internetting' was not going to be intuitive . . . it
was felt that since the Internet was going to be difficult to navigate, it
would be good if we could do something to smooth the way for our
clientele."

================================================
Step 3: Develop Internet Construction Guidelines

As librarians, you also should participate in developing policy and
standards for the material that is to be posted as part of your
organization's Internet presence. As the number of people engaged in
placing information on the Internet increases, so does the variety of ad
hoc organization, presentation, and style. Typically, MIS staff--often
assigned to take the lead role in preparing an organization's Internet
presence--are not aware of the commitment that the organization is making
by placing electronic documents and information on the corporation's
Internet site. They haven't thought about the value of the information over
time; retention and updating requirements; how to migrate the material to
the coming generation of electronic storage systems; or how to cite and
classify the material to facilitate users in finding it.

Managing information is what we do by trade. Here are some possibilities
for contributing to the development of your organization's Internet
presence:

* Work on document construction guidelines that use hypertext markup
language (HTML) standards.

* Establish required content guidelines for each page: e.g., name of group
responsible for data, number and size of graphics, contact information, and
date last information was revised.

* Establish a process to continually acquire, revise, and update linked
resources on the Internet including how links will be identified,
established, and checked.

* Articulate and publicize the criteria for documents published by the
organization destined only for the Internet so that the material can be
searched as a hypertext linked document since often users no longer read
serially.

* Assist in identifying materials placed on the Internet that have
permanent value and should be considered candidates for organizational
archives.

* Evaluate various search and retrieval engines: e.g., Lycos, WebCrawler,
Yahoo, World Wide Web Worm, InfoSeek Search, and Open Text Web Index.

* Develop compatible cataloging (i.e., field names and record structures),
indexing, and keyword schema to support the selected search engine.

* Determine which parts of the organization's Internet site have data that
is not to be shared with all user communities and therefore should have
limited access.

In sum, if we as librarians are willing to take some risks in stepping up
to our organization's needs, we can help our fellow employees smoothly
accelerate and merge onto the Internet infobahn.

Items on Knight-Ridder, IAC Newswires Codes, Dow Jones Offerings, Lexis-
Nexis Software, M.A.I.D. Web Site, Avenue Technologies Home Page, B & I on
CD-ROM, ISI Current Awareness

by Marydee Ojala

New Year's parties are over; the champagne's all gone; and it's now time to
focus on 1996 as a business year. As you can see, BUSINESS INFORMATION
ALERT has changed its look somewhat. I can tell you that it was quite
exciting to exchange ideas about the new look via e-mail and fax. It was
less time consuming than formal meetings and, in the end, we probably
reached better conclusions about design and content than if we had been
sequestered in a conference room somewhere. We weren't distracted by the
peripheral discussions that always seem to impinge on the main topic--even
in the best run meetings.

For the past several years, I have been writing two columns: one for
database current awareness and one called "For Your Information."
Increasingly, I was finding it more and more difficult to decide what items
to put in which column. The dividing lines between databases, search
services, CD-ROMs, books, consumer hosts, and the Internet were (and are)
becoming more fluid. The simple fact is that business information
specialists must keep up with sources in a wide variety of media. Rather
than waste time trying to categorize and classify current awareness by
database or general knowledge, we threw out the whole idea. As of this
issue, the "News and Trends" column will confront any media, so long as it
is worthy of the attention of business information specialists, AKA you,
our readers.

=========================
Knight-Ridder's New Looks

Following in our footsteps of redesign (well, probably not, but I'd like to
think so), Knight-Ridder Information has consolidated the customer
magazines of Dialog (Chronolog) and DataStar (Knight-Ridder Information
News). The new publication will be called Chronolog, and there will be both
a U.S. and a European edition.

If the first issue is any indication, the U.S. version will be slightly
larger (16 versus 12 pages for the December 1995 issue) due to additional
information and search tips about Dialog databases. Articles are shorter
and more to the point than in the previous Chronolog, but not as brief as
those in the former Knight-Ridder Information News. Hopefully the style
changes will translate into more customers reading the newsletter. Dialog's
Chronolog grew to the point of being almost unreadable. Plus, I found too
many recycled press releases and articles I'd already read in producer
newsletters.

Let's hope Knight-Ridder's new newsletter will truly do what they say it
will: Give us solutions to our information problems and maximize our time.
Serials librarians will be distressed to note that the change occurs with
the last issue of the 1995 volume year, rather than the first issue of the
1996 volume year. For more information, contact Knight-Ridder at 800-334-
2564 or 415-254-8800.

==================================
Information Access Codes Newswires

Well known to business searchers are the Predicasts product codes, most
frequently associated with the PROMT database. One of the big questions
when IAC bought Predicasts was, "Why don't you apply the Predicasts product
codes to your other business files?" Usually what searchers had in mind was
Trade & Industry.

IAC took care of that in early 1994 with some 75 percent of Trade &
Industry records from that time forward being coded with the Predicasts
product codes. Now the Predicasts codes are being added to another IAC
database. This time it's Newswire ASAP. The enhancement comes in
conjunction with a reload on Dialog to take advantage of the standardized
field structure tagging. As part of the reload, Newswire ASAP can now be
accessed from outside North America. For more information, contact
Information Access Company at 800-227-8431 or 415-378-5269.

================================
Dow Jones Expands Text Offerings

Dow Jones News/Retrieval's Text Library has expanded by 67.5 percent. A
great deal of this is due to the addition of IAC databases PROMT, Trade &
Industry, and Industry Express. Interestingly, IAC has relinquished the
database brand names when articles from these three files are added to Dow
Jones.

When you retrieve an article from any of the thousands of sources
represented by the IAC databases, they will be labeled as coming from
Information Access Company, not from an individual database. Other sources
contributing to Dow Jones' growth include the Federal Document Clearing
House (FDCH), which provides complete coverage of developments in the
federal government. That includes news conferences, congressional hearings,
White House meetings, speeches, and briefings.

On the international side--but only searchable in North America--are the FT
McCarthy press clippings. A subsidiary company of the Financial Times
(London), FT McCarthy provides company, industry, and market news clipped
from major European newspapers and business magazines. For more
information, contact Dow Jones News/Retrieval at 609-452-1511.

=========================================
Macintoshed Lexis-Nexis Research Software

An updated version of the Lexis-Nexis research software for the Macintosh
(version 2.9) can be downloaded directly from the Lexis-Nexis Communication
Center on the World Wide Web (http://www.lexis-nexis.com/). Improvements
include a text input window that expands to meet your search strategy
requirements, a scrollable research session history window so you can
repeat a search without re-keying it, improved document formatting, dual
column printing, Internet access, and point-and-click hypertext links to
other related documents.

You need at least a Macintosh computer (68030 or higher), System 7.0 or
higher, 4 MB RAM, one 800K or 1.4 MB disk drive, and a modem. For more
information, contact Lexis-Nexis at 800-227-4908 or michael.galamb@lexis-
nexis.com.

=============================
Profound Chooses the Internet

In one of his typical profound quotes, M.A.I.D plc CEO Dan Wagner, declared
recently: "Online is the Internet and the Internet is online." That was to
preface his announcement that the Profound Business Intelligence Online
Service will use the Internet as its main delivery mechanism.

Essentially, M.A.I.D has transformed its VAX cluster of computers into a
gigantic Web site--rather than use client/server technology--and will use
Netscape as its browser. If the final product is like the prototype, you
will be able to search the various Profound databases, including Textline,
five IAC files, market research reports, company data, and wire services
using M.A.I.D.'s InfoSort indexing.

The Internet service will run in parallel with Corporate Profound,
Profound, and Profound Business Facts on the Microsoft Network. For more
information, contact Profound at 212-750-6900 or connect to the home page
at http://www.profound.com.

==============================
Avenue Technologies on the Net

Company profiles, some 25,000 of them, can be found at Avenue Technologies
Home Page (http://www.avetech. com/avenue/). A subsidiary of DataTimes,
Avenue Technologies compiles company information from a number of different
sources, among them the DataTimes newspapers and numerous other financial
sources. The companies are both publicly and privately held.

This home page is not flashy, and there are customer endorsements--complete
with the customer's photograph--that can easily be skipped by professional
business researchers. If you want to shortcut the research process on
company background, this is one way to go. Reports cost $40 and include
graphs and charts. Delivery is to e-mail boxes. For more information,
contact Avenue Technologies at 415-705-6971 or rick@avetech.com.

==========================
Business & Industry CD-ROM

The new Business & Industry database (File 9 on Dialog, BIDB on DataStar)
will join the Knight-Ridder OnDisc family of CD-ROM databases. As with
other KR OnDisc products, searchers can choose between full-blown Dialog
search software or the simplified Easy Menu approach.

With its emphasis on facts and numeric data, Business & Industry is a good
choice for end user searching by both students and business people. The
annual cost for Business & Industry Database OnDisc is $3,995 for companies
and $2,400 for academic and public libraries. For more information, contact
Responsive Database Services, Inc. at 216-292 9620 or 800-313-2212 or by e-
mail at rdsmail@ix.netcom.com.

============================
ISI Delivers on the Internet

The newest information product for the business world is current awareness.
Funny, since it is far from a new and revolutionary concept. The latest to
join the rush to alerting services is the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI). Delivered over the Internet, ISI's Research Alert Direct
brings its Current Contents and citation index databases into competition
with such other current awareness products as Individual Inc.'s NewsPage.

Bibliographic information from ISI will be delivered directly to
subscribers' e-mailboxes. Full text can be supplied through ISI's The
Genuine Article document delivery service. ISI's new home page can be found
at http:// www.isinet.com. For more information, contact ISI at 800-336-
4474, 215-386-0100, or e-mail to isisales@isinet.com.

COMPANY INFORMATION--
Hoover's Guide to Computer Companies


Lawrence Hagemann & Eric Nee, eds. 1995. The Reference Press, Inc.
Softcover & disk versions. 667p. ISBN: 1-878753-79-7. $34.95

This is a new title in Hoover's stable of excellent and inexpensive
business directories. This particular title was published in conjunction
with Upside Publishing Company, a respected publisher of material on
emerging technology trends and their impact on the computing industry.
Upside editors contributed a brief overview article of the computer
industry and a 12-page list of who's who in the industry that includes
brief biographical information. The list-lover's compendium is expanded and
includes lists of the top companies and retailers from various sources in
addition to the Hoover's list of rankings.

The main sections contain the traditional two-page profiles, including 10
years of financial data (where available) of 77 "industry leaders" and one-
page profiles (with six years of financial data) of another 173 "selected
industry players." Another section includes a bare-bones description of 885
companies, providing only their addresses, top officers, 1994 sales, and
number of employees. There are two indexes, one of companies by
headquarters location and the other by brands, companies, and people. An
extra added attraction is an electronic version of the text on disk using a
Windows program, which will permit you to export data to other programs and
create mailing lists.

In this rapidly changing industry this is a good, inexpensive source for
all types of libraries. Other people interested in the computer industry
will find it an excellent initial source to consult. For the latest
information you will need to consult either specific-industry periodicals
or online databases. Hoover's Guide to Computer Companies is definitely a
recommended acquisition.

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT--
Vitality and Renewal: A Manager's Guide for the 21st Century


Colin Hutchinson. 1995. Praeger Publishers.
344p. Hardcover, ISBN: 0-275-95233-9, $69.50;
softcover, ISBN: 0-275-95234-7, $24.95

Written from a British perspective, but applicable to the U.S., this book
calls on business leaders to take a proactive role in moving us away from
our current wasteful use of resources to a sustainable economy in which
conservation and recycling are the norm. Author Colin Hutchinson quotes Gro
Harlem Brundtland, "Sustainable development . . . meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs," and predicts we have 40 years at most to meet our
environmental challenges.

Hutchinson's nonjudgemental and holistic approach distinguishes this book
from other more polarized environmental calls to action. He provides middle
and upper management with a framework to create environmental solutions. He
also introduces the skills needed to lead a partnership of ecological
organizations, government agencies, and business to a sustainable society.
Recognizing that the ability to bring about changes in organizational
cultures will be fundamental to achieving the goal of a sustainable
economy, Hutchinson predicts change management skills will be the key
business tool for the 21st century.

Practical techniques to bring about and manage change in an organization
are provided. Specific examples are given of corporations that have
assigned priority to ecological concerns and that have made significant
progress in controlling their effect on the environment. For instance, from
1985 to 1991, Dow Chemical cut its air emissions in half in the U.S.

Hutchinson also advocates a redefinition of economic metrics. For example,
our current measures of economic success, such as the Gross National
Product, are correlated with factors such as pollution emissions and linear
consumption of resources. In support of Hutchinson's recommendation, at
about the same time this book was published, the World Bank announced a new
system for calculating a country's net worth by assigning values to its
natural resources, capital investments, and worker productivity. Using this
new scale, Australia and Canada were rated by the World Bank as the globe's
two richest nations. The U.S. came in at 12th place.

Appendixes contain environmental checklists, and a list that identifies
major corporations with formally defended environmental policies. There is
an annotated bibliography to some 100 publications and an extensive roster
of organizations available as resources for further information or data.

Readers may initially question Hutchinson's premise that an individual, or
even a single firm, can realistically make a dent in the complex global
environmental problems facing us today. But the increasing number of
articles in the popular press about participatory management, the growing
empowerment of the individual, and the voluntary downshifting to simpler,
but higher-quality lifestyles supports Hutchinson's thesis.

Hutchinson concludes by challenging business readers to make a difference
in their organizations and communities. By taking charge of environmental
impacts, first on an individual level, then on the corporate, and finally
on the community level, Hutchinson believes business leaders have the
opportunity and the responsibility to move us to a sustainable economy.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY--
Business & Industry


1995. Responsive Database Services, Inc.
Dialog database

Business & Industry(tm) (B&I) looks as if it is another "must" in the
growing list of databases essential for thorough online research. The
October debut of B&I on Dialog and Data-Star has tongues wagging in online
circles.

B&I is produced by Responsive Database Services, Inc. (RDS), a new venture
founded by Dick Harris, formerly president of Predicasts. Early on, RDS
scored big points with its exceptional marketing push to get search
materials out to registered Dialog and Data-Star users several weeks prior
to the generous trial period. This is a wakeup call to producers who can't
seem to get materials out the door.

B&I is not duplicating the efforts of other international business
databases, e.g., Promt or F&S Index. A comparison of B&I's source
publication list to Fulltext Sources Online and Books & Periodicals Online
confirms that a majority of the publications available on B&I are also
available elsewhere but not necessarily from Knight-Ridder. Such
publications as Wirtschaftswoche, once available only through Genois, will
now reach a wider audience. B&I has limited date coverage beginning in July
1994 and plans to update daily. B&I editors exclude stories from wire
services, market research, and analyst's reports. Searchers who have waded
through similar data in Promt will applaud this decision since separate
searches are often required in unique databases.

Although the manual claims B&I's index system is "user-friendly, . . . easy
to remember and easy to apply," don't toss the documentation just yet.
B&I's indexing system consists of concept and marketing terms, product and
geographic codes, industry and company names, and document types.
Additional indexes include trade names, spokespersons, and slogans.

Here are two important points for experienced searchers: PC codes are
automatically truncated, and the concept term for market share (ct=market
share) may be a popular change from such keystroke gyrations as
market?(5n)share?. The marketing terms are especially welcome and reflect
the best of Marketing and Advertising Reference Service (MARS). The Dialog
search examples provided in the documentation are straight forward, and
standard display formats apply. Format 8 gives title, word count, and
indexing. Format 8 also indicates if an article is available in full-text.
(Searchers may also limit the search to this format by entering /FULLTEXT.)
Unfortunately, the enhanced title feature B&I has touted is not available
with a format 8, KWIC, or title display. RDS has made sure it gets a few
cents for this great feature.

Finally, a remark about the "indicative statement" that RDS provides at the
end of abstract records. If the statement begins "article contains little
further information. . . ": beware! That precious "little" may be the
missing information you've spent time and money to find.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY--
Internet Connection: Your Guide to Government Resources


Jeff Steinman, ed. 1995. Bernan Press.
Newsletter, 10 issues. $69

Since the early 1990s, government agencies and departments have been
exponentially increasing electronic publication of government documents and
records. Accessing these databases is sometimes only slightly less daunting
than finding those databases on the Internet. Good Web browsers, gopher
indexes, and other electronic Internet site locators are increasingly
available for those savvy information providers who regularly navigate the
Net. The Internet Connection: Your Guide to Government Resources is a print
resource intended to keep you informed about government sites on the Net.
It does just that.

This newsletter is not intended to teach readers about the Internet.
Consequently, a lot of space is not wasted defining terms. It is especially
useful for corporate information professionals or sophisticated academic
librarians who assist users in research or are responsible for their
institution's Web Site. Its drawback is that when you find a good
government reference, you cannot just electronically "forward" the
information to someone else.

On average, five government resources are brought to your attention per
issue. An example of one resource is the editor's article, "Tax Forms for
FedWorld." In this article (typical of what you will find), the Internet
address is provided. Step-by-step instructions for logging on and
maneuvering through FedWorld to get to the subject of the report are
provided. Helpful hints and good explanations for downloading the tax forms
are used. In this article little explanation is required for what a tax
form is but other articles do explain the scope of the government resource.

What I liked most about the newsletter was its back-page diagram outlining
government resources at a glance. The diagram summarizes what has been in
the previous seven pages and is a precursor to an annual index. Other
serials taking this same approach include Internet World, which places
resources by subject on its back page. Information professionals should
find a use for those back pages because when the amount of space required
for the at-a-glance summary, the table of contents, and white space is
deducted, there is little more than five pages of new and usable
information.

Bernan Press is a reputable government book wholesaler, and its reputation
lends credence to this guide. What I found most helpful informationally,
were the opinions and valuative comments about the particular government
resources it is guiding you to. Information about the quality of access,
currency, maneuverability, and scope are the valuing tools information
professionals need to know before recommending. Those professional
guideposts would be worth the subscription.

Internet Tools of the Profession: A Guide for Special Librarians


Hope Tillman, ed. 1995. Special Libraries Association.
Softcover. 250p. ISBN: 0-87111-430-5. $37.50

This reference book is a combination dictionary/teaching tool on
researching on the Internet. It is also a guide to sample locations of
information, arranged in some cases by subject and in others by unique
Special Libraries Association (SLA) interests. As it is an in-house
publication intended for SLA members, part of its layout follows the
division/geographic organization of SLA. Internet resources therefore are
divided into the 28 SLA subject divisions. Seven, including business and
finance, chemistry, education, food/agriculture/nutrition, information
technology/networking, nuclear science, and pharmaceutical provide
evaluative resource lists. The other divisions have a hit-or-miss list
without evaluations. The editor tells us that this is because many
divisions were not able or willing to participate. Therefore, the list of
subjects is not in itself a ranking of importance as an arbitrary and
random self-selection.

Authors of the evaluative lists follow the same editorial outline,
including detailing the purpose and value of that particular title. The
selection criteria for putting a title on the lists is, however, solely the
author's. For example the 19 resources cited under Information
Technology/Networking were selected because they may be used for keeping
current and are helpful for librarians who train others in accessing the
Internet. On the other hand, the 19 resources selected under Education were
chosen for their representation of the diverse interests of the division's
membership. Food/Agriculture and Nutrition titles were selected because of
their proven usefulness in that type of library.

The publication's value to information professionals lies less in the small
highly selective subject lists, than in the evaluative information provided
with some references. When used in conjunction with the index, the lists
may prove helpful. Its other great value to the SLA member is the 34
addresses where SLA discussion groups can be found. Enough information is
provided to be able to either find a forum or subscribe to the lists. The
editor is correct that there is a need for updates to these lists. Sample
screens were found helpful.

This publication is not a must for libraries. Comprehensive subject guides
exist in print and on the Net. It is however a helpful resource for the
personal professional growth of information professionals. It will
certainly aid new SLA members who join a division and wonders what core
Internet resources are peer-recommended.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS--
Doing Business in the New Vietnam


Christopher Engholm. 1995. Prentice Hall Publishers, Inc.
Hardcover. 256p. ISBN: 0-13-325853-X. $24.95

This reference book contains guide information about doing business in
Vietnam today. The comprehensive volume accommodates information about
Vietnam on a range of business topics including country profile, selling
to, investing in, and working with the Vietnamese. Additionally, it affords
up-to-date information including useful business addresses, trade contacts,
sample contractual agreements, and visitor information.

Many informed business leaders and scholars see Vietnam as the hottest new
business frontier in the Pacific Rim. In spite of its stigma as a
"communist country," Vietnam is experiencing booming growth with negligible
inflation, a standardized currency, low labor rates, and a population of
70-plus million with a work-hard philosophical background. Today, with
recent (and continuing) government and market reforms, business and
commerce in Vietnam operates as a near "free market economy" system. All
this rapid economic expansion offers opportunities for exporters,
investors, entrepreneurs, and business executives.

To write this book, Engholm draws on his experience, which includes
founding The Engholm Group--which specializes in public relations and
company representation in Asia and Latin America--international business
consulting, presenting seminars, and writing this book. In this practical
guidebook, he provides dozens of useful tips and effective strategies for
developing profitable relationships with Vietnamese businesses and the
Vietnamese people. Engholm's previous books are Doing Business in Asia's
Booming "China Triangle" (1994) and When Business East Meets Business West:
A Guide to Practice and Protocol in the Pacific Rim, the Asia and Japan
Business Information Sourcebook (1991).

The book opens with a preface, short introduction, and brief glossary of
key terms and acronyms. Its four parts contain four chapters each. Part 1
contributes a profile of the people, the economy, the politics, and the
business scene. Demographic and economic facts, the official government
structure, a chronology of Vietnam-U.S. relations, and the climate for
business are analyzed. Historical background, the Chinese influence, and
the Vietnamese people and their work ethic also are addressed.

Part 2, "Selling to Vietnam," confronts the primary marketing topics.
Chapter 5, "What Vietnam Wants to Buy," points out many facts that go
beyond what standard summary statistics would indicate. Even though Vietnam
is statistically one of the poorest countries in the world with a GNP per
capita of only $200, disposable income by consumers varies greatly. Among
the 72 percent of the populations still working in agriculture, many cannot
even afford a bicycle and earn barely $50 per year. On the other hand,
about 49 percent of the urban households have at least one motorcycle (with
new Hondas selling for $1,700). Details about entering the market
(import/export regulations, setting up a sales representative's office,
rent, registration, and bank accounts); channels of distribution
(wholesaling, retailing, channels, shipping, customs/clearance, and
warehousing); and advertising and promotion (trade shows, billboards,
regulation, cost/rates,) are presented.

"Investing in Vietnam" is the topic of Part 3. Issues such as why and with
whom to invest, types of foreign venture allowed, foreign investment
regulation, favorable regions (provinces) for investment, regulations and
license requirements, finding local investment partners, the rapidly
emerging private sector, project approval and start-up, working with
Vietnamese labor, finding skilled workers and recruiting managers,
unionization and strikes, and wage administration are discussed. Chapter 11
looks at the in's and out's of "Transferring Technology" and presents
Vietnam's attitude toward Western technology. The part's final chapter
deals with financing, taxes, and commercial disputes. The banking sector
and capital markets also are explained.

The fourth and final part, "Working with the Vietnamese," centers on
business culture (differences with other Asian countries, trust-based
relationships, gifts and bribes, and managing and motivating workers);
communicating and negotiating (use of an interpreter, meeting approaches
and tactics); essential etiquette and protocol (business cards, names
usage, dining and drinking, gifts, holidays, and "lucky and unlucky" days);
traveling (hotels, air/road/train, health and safety risks, money matters,
working hours, entertainment and shopping, recreation, what to bring); and
living in Vietnam (paperwork required, renting a house, community support,
and life quality). The work's appendixes provide useful business and trade
contacts with addresses and phone numbers, sample contractual agreements,
and visitor information (addresses and phone numbers of airlines, hotels,
museums, restaurants, and nightclubs/discotheques).

This well-written guide equips readers with an array of good advice. For
example, knowing how to avoid costly mistakes when dealing with the
government and how to conduct yourself through the intricacies of
socializing could make the difference between success and failure in a
business venture. One of the strengths of this book versus other recent
books on the same topic (Doing Business in Vietnam, 1995 by James W.
Robinson; Vietnam: Business Opportunities and Risks, 1995 by Joseph P.
Quinian; Vietnam: A Business Handbook, 1994 by Neil Ashwood) is that it
covers the topics by asking and answering practical yet probing questions
such as, "What is the Vietnamese attitude toward American business and vice
versa?" and "Should a firm begin promotion of its products and services at
a trade show in Vietnam?". Additionally, the book is enhanced with about 25
pages of photographs and numerous graphs, tables, and charts to add to and
clarify the volume's content.

Doing Business in the New Vietnam is recommended for practicing managers,
consultants, government officials, academics and advanced students, and
others interested in pursing import/export trade, investment, or additional
commerce-driven interaction with the economically-emerging new Vietnam.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS--
JADE: Japanese Accounts and Data on Enterprise


1994. Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing Inc.
CD-ROM database. $12,000

This intriguing product will be useful to anyone working with the Japanese
market. Teikoku Databank has long been know as a leading supplier of
corporate credit information from Japan. Its two English language online
databases--one of profile data and one of full financials--have made it
much easier for researchers to find information on Japanese companies.

JADE takes the information from the Teikoku Full Financial database, adds
several useful data items, and tops it with a powerful package of financial
analysis software. The database covers some 10,000 Japanese companies,
providing a full range of profile information (name, address, telephone,
year of incorporation, number of employees, credit rating, trading banks,
CEO background, to name a few); financial data (balance sheet and profit &
loss account in a standardized format); and 22 ratios calculated from the
balance sheet. A welcome addition to Teikoku Databank's standard
information is U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), UK SIC, and
NACE codes. These do not translate perfectly to Teikoku Databank's own
Industrial Classification, but Western searchers will find them much more
familiar.

Searching is straight-forward and fast. In addition to the profile
information, it is possible to search by the 22 ratios, 12 financials, or
the year-on-year trends of those financials. Once a company or companies
are found, there is a wide variety of reports that can be produced,
including those in user-defined formats. The financial analysis software
allows users to get a detailed analysis of an individual company's
finances. In addition, it permits analysis of a group of companies, or of
one company relative to its peer group. The results of the analysis can be
in report format or a selection of effective graphic formats. It is also
possible to download data for use in other software packages. Several
custom export formats such as dBase, Lotus, Excel, are included, as is
ASCII and DIF.

In general, the interface is very clean and easy to use. As a sample
application, it was quite simple to select manufacturers of cameras,
identify the most profitable firm in terms of Return on Investment, display
its cost structure, and compare several of its performance ratios to the
industry norm over time.

The one caveat has to do with the nature of Japanese financial reports.
Financial reporting standards in Japan are significantly more lax than
those in the U.S. Also, there are several differences in practice, such as
reporting stocks at book value, that can lead to different results than
would be expected under Western standards. All this should be kept in mind
when interpreting one's findings.

The database is updated quarterly. It is available for DOS and Windows and
can be included on local and wide area networks.

REFERENCE--
The Directory of Business Information Resources


Ed note: Although this publication is a third edition, we included it due
to its relevance.

3d ed. 1995. Grey House Publishing.
Softcover. 1,197p. ISBN: 0-939300-60-5. $155

This third edition of The Directory of Business Information Resources is a
hefty softcover with 1,197 pages of information on 90 different industry
groups, form accounting to wholesalers. When evaluating this book, one's
immediate reaction is to compare it to its venerable predecessor, Gale's
Encyclopedia of Business Sources (EBIS), now in its 10th edition in two
hardcover volumes. The younger directory comes off fairly well in
comparison, though it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Here's
why.

According to the numbered entries, The Directory of Business Information
Resources contains 13,489 brief paragraphs that describe the associations,
newsletters, magazines, trade shows, directories, and databases in each
industry. Each entry is listed only once, unlike EBIS where the same
information can be listed numerous times under different categories. The
Directory is much more straightforward in its arrangement, which makes it
easier to use but also much less sophisticated for subject searching. For
example, in EBIS, the accounting section contains numerous "see references"
and divides the industry into subgroups such as cost accounting, government
accounting, and accounting research. This means the reader has to guess
which section to look under and also creates entry duplication. The
Directory, on the other hand, has a 14-page section on accounting with no
"see references" and all entries placed together according to type. It is
one-stop shopping at its best.

Typical directory entries contain brief, basic information: name, address,
phone, and fax number, one contact person, and either a description that
can be as brief as one line or no description at all. There are no
electronic addresses, and information such as association membership
numbers or publication print schedule is often missing. This fact makes for
very uneven value among entries.

EBIS tends to treat the "whole industry" as it were, with sections that
include statistics sources, financial ratios, and price sources in addition
to the basic section echoed in The Directory. EBIS also treats the business
world in general in much more detail, by including discrete sections on
such topics as employee motivation, acid rain, and AIDS policy.

The Directory of Business Information Resources has some curious omissions.
For example, the Computers & Data Processing Industry section makes no
mention of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) nor the Institute
for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), two of the largest
organizations in the field. Nor does it include such widely circulated
publications as Infoworld, PC Magazine, or PC Week, though it does have
Computerworld, PC Computing, and BYTE. These important omissions in an
industry with which I am familiar lead me to suspect there may be similar
ones in other industries. Some of the more obscure entries for this
industry, such as NEWMEDIA and Proclaimer, listed in the "Magazines &
Journals" section, contain no descriptive information and therefore are of
very limited utility.

Another glaring omission is in the health care of medical industry, which
is of great current importance, but is all but ignored except for the
mention of a few publications scattered throughout the book. However, this
industry is very well treated in EBIS. Yet The Directory includes such
eclectic groups as the "gifts" industry and the "motorcycles" industry.

One definite plus for The Directory is its entry index, sorely lacking in
EBIS. The Directory's other index is a publisher index. Since reference
works of this type are generally used to find information on a topic
unknown to the researcher, a subject index also would be helpful to
indicate to users the editorial decisions on entry placement. Also, The
Directory does seem to have a great many small, regional organizations and
publications.

If it is important for your library to have the most comprehensive
collection of this type of information in print, then this volume is a
necessary addition to your collection. If you have a limited budget and can
only purchase one title, I'd have to stick with the Gale publication.
