<I>[From Liu, W.T., W. Tang, and R. Atlas, 1996: Responses of the tropical
Pacific to wind forcing as observed by spaceborne sensors and simulated by
an ocean general circulation model  [J. Geophys. Res., 101, 16,345-16,359,
1996]</I> <P>
 
Satellite observations, in situ measurements, and model simulations are
combined to assess the oceanic response to surface wind forcing in the
equatorial Pacific.  The surface wind fields derived from observations by
the spaceborne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) and from the
operational products of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) are compared.  The top figure shows significant mean
difference between the two wind-stress fields.  When SSMI winds are used to
force a primitive-equation ocean general circulation model (OGCM), they
produce 3C more surface cooling than ECMWF winds for the eastern
equatorial Pacific during the cool phase of an El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) event, as shown in the middle figure.  The stronger cooling by SSMI
winds is in good agreement with measurements at the moored buoys and
observations by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).
While the most significant wind differences are found off the equator
(centered at 15N and 5S), the largest differences in ocean temperature
responses are found on the equator and below the surface (as shown in the
bottom figure).  The bottom figure, together with the heat budget analysis
using OGCM simulated data under different winds, infers that vertical heat
advection and uplifting of the thermocline are the dominant factors in the
anomalous cooling of the ocean mixed layer.  The results of this study
indicate that the spacebased winds are superior to winds from weather
prediction model in forcing realistic oceanic response, particularly the
sea surface anomalies during an ENSO event.  The study demonstrates certain
maturity and also deficiency in OGCM, and identifies the dominant mechanism
for anomalous upper ocean cooling in the 1980s (which may be different from
the events in 1990s as discussed by Liu et al., 1996, Eos, 76, 429 and
437).  It is an example of combining spacebased ocean observing sensors and
OGCM for significant contribution to our understanding of
seasonal-to-interannual variability and predictability.

<I>Figure Caption</I><BR>
The top figures shows the distribution of the absolute value of Student's t
which is the mean difference between SSMI and ECMWF zonal wind stresses
divided by the standard error.  The areas where the mean difference has
more than 1% probability to come by pure chance from wind stresses of equal
means are colored.  The middle figure shows a comparison of first-level
(5-m) temperatures produced by the OGCM, when forced by SSMI and ECMWF
winds, with AVHRR and buoy SST at a location along the equator.  The
climatological annual cycle derived from the AVHRR SST is also shown.  The
bottom figure shows the time-depth variation of the difference between OGCM
temperature simulations under SSMI and ECMWF winds.
