<B>Project Title: Engineering Improvements for Purpose-built Electric Vehicles<p>
Performing Organization: PIVCO A/S</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Christophe Malaterre  (818) 565-5600</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>PIVCO has developed a lightweight, efficient and inexpensive two-passenger urban electric vehicle, which is currently in beta prototype testing in Europe and the United States.  This car, which is projected be available for $10,000 in low volumes of production, is currently being upgraded to meet U.S. highway speeds (65 mph), as well as acceleration and driving range capabilities for the U.S. commuter market.
</P>

<P>This program will provide critical engineering design improvements and durability testing for the PIVCO CITI vehicle.  Specifically, this program will consist of additional safety and crashworthiness testing (side impact and rollover requirements); durability testing of the power train; fit and finish design improvements; and additional sourcing support to identify and incorporate more U.S.-made components into the production vehicle.</P>

<P>This program is part of a larger engineering design and compliance program at PIVCO which is leading to development of the final production-ready model of the CITI vehicle.  PIVCO's goal is to begin production of these vehicles in the U.S. in the first 3-6 months of 1997, initially at 10,000 vehicles per year, but increasing quickly thereafter.
</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>During the first two months of the project, PIVCO will complete most of the safety testing and the durability testing.  By the ninth month of the project, the design improvements will be complete.  Sourcing and final crashworthiness testing will be completed by the end of the 12-month program period.
