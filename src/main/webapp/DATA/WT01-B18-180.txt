<title>Building Retrofits Cut Energy Bills</title>
<table><tr><td><blockquote>



<H3>1. Building Retrofits Cut Energy Bills While Improving Worker Comfort and 
Productivity</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Energy-efficiency retrofits for existing buildings and residences have 
attractive economic returns. For example, a three-year payback, which is 
typical in lighting retrofits, is an internal rate of return of 33 
percent - generally superior to the results of financial managers for 
personal investments. Retrofits typically cut energy use by 50 cents or 
more per square foot of commercial space, a significant reduction in 
overhead.<a href="#164" name="r164"> [ 164 ] </a>
<p>     The greatest gains, however, are found - somewhat 
surprisingly - in improved worker productivity that often results from 
efficiency improvements.<a href="#165" name="r165"> [ 165 ] </a>Because labor costs dwarf energy costs per 
square foot, productivity gains often are the prime motivator for 
businesses to improve energy efficiency.<a href="#166" name="r166"> [ 166 ] </a>In the following examples, 
companies set out to cut energy and maintenance expenditures through 
energy-efficiency retrofits. Gains in worker productivity were often an 
unintended, added benefit of the energy efficiency investments.<a href="#167" name="r167"> [ 167 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     Main Post Office, Reno, Nevada. </B></I>In 1986, mail 
sorters at the Main Post Office in Reno, Nevada became the most productive 
in the western region of the United States. A $300,000 lighting retrofit, 
which included a lowered ceiling that made the room easier to heat and 
cool, boosted productivity more than 6 percent annually. The rate of 
sorting errors by machine operators dropped to 0.1 percent  - the 
lowest error rate in the western region. The annual energy and maintenance 
savings came to about $50,000 - a six-year payback. The productivity 
gains, however, were worth $400,000 to $500,000 per year, and paid for the 
entire renovation in less than a year.<a href="#168" name="r168"> [ 168 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     DOE's James Forrestal Building.</B></I> The U.S. 
government spends $9 billion each year on energy for federal buildings, 
operations, and employee transport. Federal agencies are required by law 
to reduce their energy use by 30 percent in the next decade (from 1985 
consumption levels).<a href="#169" name="r169"> [ 169 ] </a>The goal is to save $400 million annually by the 
year 2000, and $1 billion a year by 2005. The DOE has made strides toward 
this goal, starting with its own headquarters, the James Forrestal 
Building in Washington, D.C. Lighting upgrades in 1994 cut energy bills by 
two-thirds. Because the retrofits produce higher quality light, worker 
comfort and productivity has increased. The cost of the project, $1.36 
million, was paid for with a <B><I><A NAME="PotomacElectricPowerCompany">Potomac Electric Power Company<a></B></I> 
utility rebate plus private-sector financing from an energy-service 
company (ESCo). The ESCo will recover its investment from the anticipated 
63 percent savings in lighting consumption. The reduced electricity demand 
cuts pollution emissions in the local utility service area by 27 metric 
tons of sulfur dioxide, 14 metric tons of nitrous oxide, and more than 
3,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide.<a href="#170" name="r170"> [ 170 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     City of Phoenix's Energy Management Program.</B></I> 
Municipalities and school districts have improved productivity through 
energy-efficiency retrofits. The Energy Management Program for the city of 
Phoenix, Arizona installed energy-efficiency measures in 300 municipal 
buildings - including an airport, water and waste treatment plants, 
offices, libraries, and fire and police stations - saving the city 
$22.8 million over 16 years, plus far greater savings in worker 
productivity improvements. Energy savings over this period exceeded 
290,000 megawatt hours, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 
105,000 metric tons.<a href="#171" name="r171"> [ 171 ] </a>

<B><I>EPA's Energy Star Buildings Program.</B></I> In April 1995, 
EPA launched a comprehensive, nationwide strategy for maximizing 
energy-efficiency in existing buildings. EPA's "Energy Star Buildings" 
program is underway in twenty-four "showcase" buildings nationwide, and 
includes buildings owned by <B><I><A NAME="Honeywell,Inc.">Honeywell, Inc.<a>, Inc.,

<A NAME="TargetStores">Target Stores<a>, 
<A NAME="WashingtonTimes,The">Washington Times </a>,</B></I> and others. <BR>
<p>     The program involves a five-stage upgrade strategy that capitalizes 
on system interactions to maximize energy savings at minimum cost. After 
upgrading to energy-efficient lighting (stage 1), participants tune up 
building systems (stage 2) and reduce heating and cooling loads (stage 3). 
Participants then improve fans and air-handling systems (state 4) and 
improve heating and cooling equipment (stage 5). Upgrades are staged so 
that heating and cooling loads are reduced before major HVAC equipment 
upgrades are initiated. This staged approach provides immediate energy 
cost savings and ensures proper load matching when upgrading major 
equipment in the latter stages of the strategy.<BR>
<p>     Results in the showcase buildings have been impressive. On average, 
participants are reducing their energy use by 35 percent and earning a 58 
percent return on their investment. By the year 2000, the Energy Star 
Buildings program could lower annual U.S. buildings energy expenditures 
from today's $70 billion annually to about $42 billion.<a href="#172" name="r172"> [ 172 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="164"  HREF="#r164">164.</a> These gains are typically tiny compared to the cost of employees, 
which is greater than the total energy and operating costs of a building. 
A 1990 national survey of large office buildings measured average 
electricity costs at $1.53 per square foot. Maintenance and repairs add 
another $1.37 per square foot. Labor, on the other hand, costs on average 
$130 per square foot - 72 times the energy costs. Thus, an increase of 
1 percent in productivity can nearly offset a company's entire annual 
energy expenditures. Romm, J., and Browning, W., <I>Greening the Building

factors can be improved by fewer distractions from eye strain or poor 
thermal comfort, and similar variables. <I>Id.</I><BR>
