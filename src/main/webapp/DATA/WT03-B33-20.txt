DISASTER RECOVERY FOR INFORMATION: IS YOUR BUSINESS PREPARED?

      Recent bombings at New York's World Trade Center and in
London's financial district indicated the vulnerability of any
business' information technology. SECURITY TECHNOLOGY NEWS has
learned an evaluation of security operations at the World Trade
Center--including the security of technology applications--has
been underway for the past six weeks.  Results of the evaluation
could be available by July 1, John Horn of Kroll Associates of
New York told us.  Kroll is conducting the security analysis by
request of the building owners, the Port Authority of New Jersey
and New York.
      Disaster contingency planning and recovery of information
technology is one area a number of businesses have little
expertise, security experts say, and some businesses need to
smarten up.
      "Businesses need to recognize how quickly the information
technology environment is changing and the implications this has
for security and recovery," Keith Hearnden, said, who spearheaded
a recent study on the business perils of computer failure.
Hearnden, a lecturer on security management at the Loughborough
University in London, collaborated on the study with IBM and the
Computing Services Association to survey more than 3,000
businesses on disaster recovery plans for computer failure.
      The study, which was recently published by IBM's Business
Recovery Services, showed 13 percent of businesses waited 13-24
months before testing their contingency plans; 24 percent waited
7-12 months; and 30 percent waited four to six months before
testing plans.  The study also showed 31 percent had tested their
plans within three months.
      "It is imperative to ensure that the whole business can be
recovered rather than use central computing facilities.  If
customers and reputation are irreparably damaged, what is the use
of a fully operational information technology system," he said.
      "This means radically rethinking the approach to disaster
recovery.  It means identifying and accepting the level of
dependency of a business on information technology.  It means
tackling the issue head on and being prepared to use practices
which are capable of incorporating and responding to the very
latest developments in business developments.
      "Lest there remain any doubt about the importance of
protecting a business' information technology, consider the fact
that information technology's share of the overall capital stock
of U.S. corporations has jumped to 25 percent in key areas such
as communications, finance, business services, healthcare and
education,"  Hearnden said.
      "Contingency plans are usually prepared by IT [information
technology] staff and IT staffs are traditionally oriented toward
mainframes, Carole Allen of IBM's Business Recovery Services
said.  IBM and others recommend that firms carry out business
impact analyses as part of contingency planning so that they
understand thoroughly the impact and cost of the loss of
applications and then set recovery priorities. "A recovery plan
is only effective if it provides for all risk areas, is regularly
tested and takes account of the forces of change and adapts
accordingly," Allen said.
      Nearly 36 percent of employees were uprooted and many had to
work from home after the blast; 16 percent worked in offices on
temporary leases and 7 percent of the work was moved abroad,
according to a report by Contingency Planning Research in
Jericho, N.Y.
      Chi/Cor Information Management, a Chicago-based company
contacted by STN, provides software for companies to buy to set
up emergency response plans.  The software provides guidelines of
a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to include: project
organization; business impact analysis, security review, strategy
development, vital records backup and recovery, disaster recovery
plan development, and testing and maintenance. All of these
items have to be updated as the business grows and technology
changes.  "You have to protect equipment and people as well as
protect the longevity of your business by creating a recovery
plan," Heidi Ewell, marketing manager for Chi/Cor said.

STUDY - NO DETECTION TECHNOLOGY EXISTS FOR EXPLOSIVES

      An advisory board for the National Research Council recently
concluded that there is no single detection technology "that can,
by itself, provide a high probability of detection coupled with a
low false alarm rate that will reduce the threat of terrorism at
an acceptable cost to airport operations."
      The board recommended further examination of technologies
funded by the FAA for research and development and expects the
private industry will commercialize the results.
      The 85-page study, called, "Detection of Explosives for
Commercial Aviation Security," was submitted by the National
Materials Advisory Board to the Commission on Engineering and
Technical Systems with the National Research Council.  The board
conducted the study under contract with the Federal Aviation
Administration and asked the FAA to define the regulatory
strategy to be used for explosive detection devices and
encouraged the agency to encourage industry participation in the
rulemaking process.

Technology Developments

      The technologies under development have a high, medium or
low priority tagged onto them.  The high priority technologies
could be deployed within the next several years and they include:
      Thermal Neutron Activation (TNA)--low energy neutrons
captured by nitrogen atoms; provides detection capability against
larger quantities of highly energetic explosives with a high
nitrogen content.
      Dual Energy X-ray--alternating X-ray beams of high and low
energy levels producing two different images due to differences
between the photoelectric and Compton attenuation coefficients of
the different elements.  Looks for average atomic number, but not
a specific number.
      Extremely Low Dose X-ray--Produces images at a lower x-ray
level.
      Coherent X-ray Scattering--an X-ray diffraction that depends
on the crystal structure of the explosive.
      Dual Energy X-ray Computed Tomography--A computed tomography
image used as a map of the X-ray attenuation.
      Vapor/Particle Detection Devices--uses low vapor pressure of
plastic explosives. Technologies on a medium or low priority
include:  elastic neutron scattering; pulsed fast neutron
activation; photon activation; nuclear resonant absorption; fast
neutron associated particle and backscatter analysis X-ray.

The Future of Aviation Security Technology

      The future of aviation security technology was revealed in a
recent speech given by a scientific advisor of Civil Aviation
Security for the Federal Aviation Administration.  Dr. Lyle O.
Malotky told the aviation audience "changes in security
technology are both evolutionary--that it is an improvement to
something we are already doing, and revolutionary--a dramatic
departure from existing procedures and thinking."
      Malotky gave short-term and long-term solutions to improve
the quality of the aviation security system worldwide.
      Today, he said, a way to improve aviation security is to
meet the challenge of searching common consumer electronics for
hidden explosives. Commercially available explosive vapor
detection systems provide an increased level of protection when
screening electronics, he said. The complexity of assembly and
the vents accessing the interior of the electronics make them
attractive for this technology.
      Also, implement enhanced X-ray systems capable of
identifying the presence of organic materials mixed with
inorganic camouflage work well for the examination of
electronics. Unlike a traveler's suitcase, electronics contain
very little organic material, so the explosive stands out in the
background.

A Look to the Future of Aviation Security

      The future of aviation security is "transparent screening."
Without the knowledge or cooperation of passengers, their baggage
will automatically be searched for the tools of terrorism--
weapons and explosives.  Malotky said the magnitude of the
aviation industry--the 500 million people and one billion pieces
of luggage that fly every year in the United States--require
airlines to conduct these security functions automatically.
      Changes will be made in the aircraft cargo container design,
Malotky predicted.  Part of the challenge of explosive detection
is the small size of the explosive charge that may bring down a
commercial airliner.
      By changing the design of baggage containers and using high
strength composite materials, it will increase the blast
resistance of the aircraft while reducing the repair and
replacement cost of the baggage containers.
      Also, probing radiation will be routinely used to detect
explosives concealed in baggage in the next five to 10 years.  A
variety of approaches have been used and progress made in this
area. Typical of the anomaly detection approaches are various
dual energy X-ray, X-ray backscatter, X-ray tomography, magnetic
resonance, dielectric measurements, and thermal neutron systems.
More specific signatures detected by technologies like nuclear
quadruple resonance, X-ray diffraction, or fast neutron scatter
can improve false alarm rates. Malotky expects a final rule on
the type, quantity and reliability of an automated explosive
detection system will be published in the summer and systems will
undergo testing against the standards in late 1993.
      There must be cooperation between the air carrier, airports
and the FAA to implement future security aviation technology.
The air carriers and airports will implement these changes while
the FAA funds the aviation security research and requires the
technological innovations.
      "Something needs to be done today to implement the
technologies we have now even though they are not the ultimate
solution," he said. "Failure to put in place the best security
technology we have leaves the entire system vulnerable to
attack."  (National Academy Press, 800/624-6242.)

U.S. RANKS LOW IN TERRORIST INCIDENTS

      The State Department sent a clear message to members of
Congress in a recent report that while the United States held the
lowest number of reported international terrorist incidents,
state-sponsored terrorism should still be a concern for all
governments.
      "Despite progress and successes, the threat of terrorism,
particularly state-sponsored terrorism, is still serious,"
Laurence E. Pope, acting coordinator for counterterrorism, said
in the introduction of the annual report. In the coming decade,
"we will certainly face serious challenges from terrorism growing
out of ethnic, religious tensions around the world.  Our response
must be to maintain our vigilance, increase our capabilities and
further develop cooperation."
      The report, "Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1992" praised the
United States, its allies and the U.N. Security Council for its
diligence in increased awareness, vigorous counterterrorism
training and tougher attitudes toward terrorism.  The report
highlighted the Security Council's example of its tough
stance against terrorism in Libya's  bombing of two civilian
aircraft.

Security Council Toughens on Terrorism

      The report highlighted the example of the United Nations'
condemnation of Libyan terrorism and the imposition of sanctions
against that country to indicate the most significant change in
attitude. The U.N. Security Council voted for mandatory
sanctions against Libya for refusing to comply with terms.  The
sanctions included an arms and air embargo, a demand that Libyan
Arab Airlines offices be closed and a requirement that all states
reduce Libya's diplomatic presence abroad.  The U.N. Security
Council reviews the Libyan case every 120 days.
      "The United States, its allies and the U.N. Security Council
recognized the need to make governments pay who support, tolerate
and engage in international terrorism," Pope said.  The United
States currently lists Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and
Syria as state sponsors of terrorism.  This list is maintained in
accordance with an export administration act that imposes trade
and other restrictions on countries determined by the Secretary
of State that supports acts of international terrorism.  The list
is sent to Congress and countries can be added or deleted as
circumstances demand.

Three Aspects to the Decline in Terrorism

      In a list of reasons for the decline in terrorism, the State
Department cited these three aspects: end state-sponsored
terrorism; strengthen the rule of law; and refuse to reward
terrorists by making concessions.
      End state-sponsored terrorism.  State sponsorship refers to
governments that support, tolerate and engage in international
terrorism.  The United States, its allies and the United Nations
Security Council have recognized the need to make those
governments pay a significant price for sponsoring terrorism.
      Strengthen the rule of law.  The State Department said it
improved the judicial and law enforcement capabilities of other
nations that could be victims of terrorist acts. The State
Department has conducted training through its antiterrorism
training assistance program, and said it has improved the ability
of governments to pre-empt, to investigate and to prosecute
terrorists. In 1992, more than 1,125 senior officials from 25
countries received the training which totaled the number of
people trained to 14,000 from 75 countries. Refuse to reward
terrorists through concessions.  Third, by not making
concessions, the State Department obtained the release of the
last American hostages in Lebanon in late 1991, and Germany saw
two German relief workers freed in June 1992.  The abductors had
demanded the release of convicted Hizballah terrorists, but the
German government refused to meet this demand.

Report Distributed as Reference Guide

      The report, has been distributed to the Senate foreign
relations committee, House foreign affairs committee, the Senate
Judiciary Committee, and various other congressional committees
as a reference document, Mike Kraft, spokesman from the State
Department's office of counterterrorism, said.
      Last year, 361 international terrorist attacks were reported
against the United States; much lower than the 1991 figure of
567.  The State Department attributed the inflated 1991 figure to
a number of incidents during the Gulf War. The report also
indicated that in 1992, 40 percent of the incidents were directed
at U.S. citizens and property. Assessments of foreign countries
where significant terrorist acts occurred were included as well
as the previous year's activities of individuals, terrorist
groups or umbrella groups known to be responsible for the
kidnapping or death of any American citizen during the past five
years.
      An overview is given of other international terrorist
incidents in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle
East.  The report also talked about specific incidents in Angola,
Sudan, Afghanistan, India, Japan, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri
Lanka, Thailand, Germany, Greece, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom,
the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, Argentina,
Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Algeria, Egypt, Israel,
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Yemen.  The
highest number of incidents were in Latin America, Western Europe
and the Middle East. (State Department, 202/647-6575.)

VIDEOS OFFER TIPS ON INFORMATION SECURITY & DISASTER RECOVERY

      Boston-based Commonwealth Films offers videos to teach
corporations about information security and disaster recovery.
"As society continues to access people using high technology, the
database of a company will be its most valuable asset, Christine
Sullivan, president of Hawthorne Associates, told SECURITY
TECHNOLOGY NEWS.  Hawthorn Associates represents Commonwealth
Films.  Commonwealth's videos teach corporations how to safeguard
company information.  "If safeguards are not taken, a company is
vulnerable to disaster," Sullivan said, "and [a person's] job
could be on the line if nothing is done about respecting a
company's security."
      The videos teach every level of employee to respect a
company's computer and the company's proprietary information.
The videos, which cost $525 each, include:
     Back in Business: Disaster Recovery

     Mum's the Word: PC/LAN Security
     Under Wraps: Information Security
     Locking the Door: Computer Security
     Access Denied: Computer Crime (available at end of June)

Disasters Can Ruin a Business

      "The horrible statistic is that 72 percent of all businesses
hit by disaster, however defined, either fail outright or within
three years.
      "There's a need for videos that teach company planning for
how you're going to handle a disaster, not as a bureaucratic
hurdle but as the survival of your business,"  Sullivan told
Kathleen Silvassy, Editor of VIDEO MARKETING NEWS, our sister
newsletter.
      "A growing concern among companies is that we're in the
information technology age as manufacturing declines, and your
value is the information you hold.
      "If your computers can be wrecked, you become very
protective of your property.  It doesn't just have to be a
computer virus.  It can be a hurricane or someone coming in and
blowing up your machines.  Look at the World Trade Center."
(Commonwealth Films, 223 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, Mass. 02116;
617-262-5634; fax 617-262-6948).
