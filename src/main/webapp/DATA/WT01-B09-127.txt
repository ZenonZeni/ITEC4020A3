<B>Project Title: High Voltage Variable Speed AC to AC Motor Drive (traction drive inverter demonstration)<p>
Performing Organization: D.C. Transformation
</B>


<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>D.C. Transformation, Inc. (DCT) has an innovative inverter topology that can be readily adapted to meet the power conditioning
requirements of a traction drive vehicle. A high power inverter that can accept variable frequency AC input voltage and produce a
variable frequency AC output at high efficiency can be achieved using DCT's Power Conditioning System (PCs). Preliminary
discussions with motor generator manufacturers have pointed out that a matched motor generator pair operators at an optimum
voltage of approximately 3kV can achieve an efficiency in excess of 98.5%. The PCS technology is well suited for operation at or
above the 3kV point with power levels ruing into the megawatts.</P>

<P>A prototype system is being built in a laboratory environment for proof of principle purposes and for validation of the analytical
model. In the current configuration, facility power of 580 VAC will now through a 300kva three phase full­wave bridge rectifier to
be converted to ­4OOVDC. The 144kW inverter will transform the 400 VDC to 440 VAC. The output voltage will be adjustable
from a minimum of 17S VAC to a maximum of 440vAC. The output frequency will be variable from DC to 80Hz. The conversion
rate, which directly affects the output voltage, will vary from approximately 200Hz to 2880Hz. The inverter is comprised of three
homogeneous two-stage modules. Each rnodule has two complimentary stages operating 180 degrees out of phase at a
frequency of 1440 Hz. The output waveform is therefore reconstructed at a frequency of 2880 Hz. The higher Inversion rate
significantly reduces the filter requirements and improves the output power quality.</P>

<P>The inversion process is composed of three cycles, sequential­resonant charging, inverse and discharge. Each cycle is currently
configured to occur in series. The charging cycle draws energy from the source and resonantly charges a set of capacitors. The
inversion cycle complements the purity d a one or two of the charging capacitors, depending on the AC output phase angle. The
discharge cycle then delivers the energy to the load through a output LC filter. For this demonstration a unity power factor load
will be used.</P>

<P>This innovative circuit uses a moderate frequency soft­switching technique which continuous y draws power form the AC source.
The smooth and continuous flowv of current ensures this inverter will meet the IEEE­519 standard regarding the production of
harmonics on the AC input line. The output voltage is conditioned with a 200Hz low pass filter which provides an AC Waveform
with a very low ripple content.</P>

<P>The OCT inverter topology is significantly less noisy than an equivalent IGBT based system. The electrically quiet nature of this
circuit leads to greater efficiency. The advantage comes from the provident use of thyristors. These devices are used in
configuration that incorporates self commutation. Meaning they are typically turned off under zero current conditions, thereby
eliminating the need for lossy snubber circuits.
</P>
<P>Integral to the 144kW inverter is the digital control system. The hybrid system combines the computational capability of a
microprocessor With the speed and dependable of programmable logic. A digital Canal processor (DSP) handles data flow contra
by interfacing to a variety IIO modules. A microcontroller generates adaptive pulse trains Rich are fed to an erasable
programmable logic device (EPLD). This device supplies triggering signals to the solid state switches.</P>

<P>The PCS device is instrumented with a variety of sensors to ensure fail­safe operation and internal fault detection. Sensors are
placed at cortical locations to monitor the operating voltage and current. The controller samples these signals to determine the
health and status of the device under test. This system can be regulated The output power is calculated on a pulse to pulse basis
and compared to a desired setpoint. The pulse repetition rate, consequently the power throughput, is adjusted to bring the system
into specification. </P>
