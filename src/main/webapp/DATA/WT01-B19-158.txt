<P>Dear Carl
<DD>Hope all is well.&nbsp;  I haven't heard from you for a long time.
<DD>I recently heard about a recent 8th Circuit decision pertaining to a group of Rastas having the right to a freedom of religion defense in regards to possession of some marijuana they were growing.
<DD>I assume that you published part of the decision in the Iowa NORML newsletter.&nbsp;  The last newsletter I have from you is the fall of 1995.&nbsp;  Please send me your latest newsletter containing the said decision if possible.
<DD>I recently returned from a trip to Florida.&nbsp;  While there I read some articles in Hemp Magazine out of Texas.&nbsp;  The articles were implying that the DEA was overstepping its authority when they opposed farmers in Colorado trying to get the right to grow hemp for commercial purposes.&nbsp;  The DEA also goes public declaring that marijuana is not a medicine & even had an agent at a protest against a radio station in Massachusetts that was playing marijuana songs.&nbsp;  The article was saying that the DEA is paid to enforce the law not make it.
<DD>Do you think that a class action lawsuit against the DEA on behalf of the sick & dying, the farmers who want to grow hemp commercially, the environmentalists who know hemp is good for the environment, those who would use marijuana as a spiritual sacrament, etc., is feasible?
<DD>Looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.
<DD>Jeff
