<H2><I>A. </I>Renewables Technologies Have Made Major Advances</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
When Congress enacted the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act 
(PURPA),<a href="#303" name="r303"> [ 303 ] </a>it required utilities to buy renewables-generated power at the 
utility's "avoided costs"<a href="#304" name="r304"> [ 304 ] </a> - which sparked the first major deployment 
of renewable energy in the U.S. market. Since then, approximately 12,000 
megawatts of nonhydroelectric renewables have come on line. Several 
states, particularly California, have encouraged the development and 
deployment of renewable resources, and have experimented with a variety of 
mechanisms to push renewables into the marketplace. <BR>
<p>     The costs of renewables have dropped, allowing them to compete with 
more conventional power generation. The U.S. DOE projects a continued drop 
in prices. At the same time, renewable capacity is expected to grow. By 
2005, renewable capacity in the United States could increase to 4,180 
megawatts of wind, 260 megawatts of photovoltaics, 3,440 megawatts of 
geothermal, and 12,500 megawatts of biomass and municipal solid waste 
energy.<a href="#305" name="r305"> [ 305 ] </a>U.S. export opportunities for renewables and efficiency 
technologies have become one of the fastest-growing economic sectors.<a href="#306" name="r306"> [ 306 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="304"  HREF="#r304">304.</a> Avoided costs are measured as the amount the utility would have had to 
spend to provide the capacity and energy itself. Utilities are able to 
pass through the cost of purchased power to ratepayers, creating an 
incentive for utilities to engage in demonstration and commercialization 
of renewables. PURPA demonstrated that competition in generation is both 
viable and beneficial and has led to an expanding renewable energy 
sector.<BR>

<P><A NAME="306"  HREF="#r306">306.</a> Internationally, India has committed to install 2,000 megawatts of 
renewable energy by 2000, and China has featured renewable energy in its 
Agenda 21 - a plan developed to achieve the objectives established by 
the Framework Convention on Climate Change. India and China alone will 
account for 35 percent of incremental electricity demand between 1993 and 
2010, requiring $450 billion in capital. Because research and development 
has driven down their costs, renewable technologies will have an 
opportunity to compete against conventional technologies in international 
markets. <I>Id. </I><BR>
