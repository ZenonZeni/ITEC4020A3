<P>
The CRC for Intelligent Decision Systems was established in 1991 to develop computer systems to automate the processes used by industry to produce outputs and deliver services. In particular, the centre aims its research at processes, usually done by humans, that require reasoning and planning.
Artificial intelligence techniques are used to develop systems that have the flexibility and common sense of a human operator. Most systems have been designed as aids to human operators. These include systems for logistics planning, manufacturing scheduling, process modelling and simulation, and document management. The majority are applications that have been developed collaboratively with industry participants.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre draws its expertise from two universities, CSIRO, Defence Science, and a number of industry-focused research groups. The broad skill set allows a team to be assembled to address the needs of multi-dimensional problems.
  The centre has the infrastructure available for development that utilises the spectrum of equipment from PCs to large parallel processing mainframes. The centre is a supplier of world-class computer systems that are designed to reason about the task being undertaken.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
<UL>
<LI>a document management system sold to CSIRO and the State Government of Tasmania;
<LI>a reasoning system used by Optus and trialled by NASA on the Space Shuttle;
<LI>an air traffic control system for Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport;
<LI>a maintenance scheduling system destined for world-wide distribution in the mining industry;
<LI>an intelligent simulation system to provide for Australian Defence assessments.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The Centre has a policy of engaging in projects aimed at providing industry collaborators with a significant edge in their product offerings and services. Project direction is determined by the industry participant whose personnel work with the research members as a team to deliver the project outcomes. This collaborative problem-solving guides the developing solution towards market requirements.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Melbourne offers three significant advantages as the location of a centre which develops systems to aid business:
Melbourne is the location of a significant number of first-class universities whose talented staff and students provide an unsurpassed resource;
Melbourne is the location of a significant number of first-class research and development groups who have a broad knowledge of technology and its applications to industry; and
Melbourne is the location of a significant component of Australian industry whose experienced staff provide direction for technical developments.
Melbourne thereby provides for the co-location of the critical resources needed to develop systems to aid business.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The centre's training program is focused at the post-graduate level. Scholarships are offered to enable students to undertake degrees that address real-world tasks. Collaborative projects provide technology transfer to industry and upgrade the skills of personnel.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
All of the centre's current projects are collaborative with industry participants. Projects are structured so that the centre receives a share of the revenue generated from the deployment of the system that is developed. This might be a percentage of the licence fee, or revenue received.
This arrangement between the CRC and industry has provided for both to share the development costs and both to receive a share of the returns. In addition, it allows projects to be initiated without industry having to fund personnel beyond their own staff, and it provides all parties with the goal of commercial success.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The Centre receives funding from the Australian Government and revenue earned from deployed systems. In-kind resources are provided by both industry and the research institutions. In 1995-96, the funding is $7 million of which $4.9 million are in-kind contributions.
