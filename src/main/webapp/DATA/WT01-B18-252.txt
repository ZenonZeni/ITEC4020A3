                UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
                 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
________________________________________________________________

CARL ERIC OLSEN,

          Petitioner,                    No. 94-1605

     -vs-

DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION,         PETITIONER'S STATEMENT
                                         OF THE ISSUES
          Respondent.
________________________________________________________________

     The Petitioner raises the following issues to be decided by

the Court:

     1.   Whether the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 

Administrator erred in ruling that the DEA may only move 

marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) 

if there is a finding of "currently accepted medical use in 

treatment in the United States."

     2.   Whether this court's ruling in Alliance for Cannabis 

Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (upholding the 

DEA's decision not to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule 

II of the CSA, based on the lack of marijuana's "currently 

accepted medical use in treatment in the United States"), 

effectively overruled this court's prior ruling in National 

Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. DEA, 559 F.2d 

735 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (finding that marijuana could be moved to 

Schedule II without having a "currently accepted medical use in 

treatment in the United States").

     3.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that the principal psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis sativa, L. 

(marijuana), the (-) delta-9-trans-THC isomer of delta-9-THC 

(dronabinol), 21 C.F.R. § 1308.12(f)(1), remains in Schedule I, 

while the identical substance becomes a Schedule II substance 

when it is contained in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

approved drug product (Marinol) "in sesame oil and encapsulated 

in a soft gelatin capsule."

     4.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that the regulation of chemicals and their plant material sources 

are distinct from, and have no relationship to, each other.

     5.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that the placement of marijuana in the CSA has no relationship to 

the scheduling of delta-9-THC, contrary to this court's ruling in 

United States v. Watson, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  

     6.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that plant materials are not treated consistently in the CSA.

     Respectfully submitted,
