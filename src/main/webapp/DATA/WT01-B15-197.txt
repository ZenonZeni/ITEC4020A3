HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE AND SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL</H3>

<H4><A NAME="SEC111">FINDINGS </A>AND PURPOSES</H4>

<P>
Sec. 111. (a) Findings. The Congress finds that
<P>
(1) radioactive waste creates potential risks and requires safe
and environmentally acceptable methods of disposal;
<P>
(2) a national problem has been created by the accumulation of
(A) spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors; and (B) radioactive
waste from (i) reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel; (ii) activities
related to medical research, diagnosis, and treatment; and (iii)
other sources;
<P>
(3) Federal efforts during the past 30 years to devise a permanent
solution to the problems of civilian radioactive waste disposal
have not been adequate;
<P>
(4) while the Federal Government has the responsibility to provide
for the permanent disposal of high- level radioactive waste and
such spent nuclear fuel as may be disposed of in order to protect
the public health and safety and the environment, the costs of
such disposal should be the responsibility of the generators and
owners of such waste and spent fuel;
<P>
(5) the generators and owners of high-level radioactive waste
and spent nuclear fuel have the primary responsibility to provide
for, and the responsibility to pay the costs of, the interim storage
of such waste and spent fuel until such waste and spent fuel is
accepted by the Secretary of Energy in accordance with the provisions
of this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.];
<P>
(6) State and public participation in the planning and development
of repositories is essential in order to promote public confidence
in the safety of disposal of such waste and spent fuel; and
<P>
(7) high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel have become
major subjects of public concern, and appropriate precautions
must be taken to ensure that such waste and spent fuel do not
adversely affect the public health and safety and the environment
for this or future generations.
<P>
(b) Purposes. The purposes of this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10131 et
seq.] are
<P>
(1) to establish a schedule for the siting, construction, and
operation of repositories that will provide a reasonable assurance
that the public and the environment will be adequately protected
from the hazards posed by high-level radioactive waste and such
spent nuclear fuel as may be disposed of in a repository;
<P>
(2) to establish the Federal responsibility, and a definite Federal
policy, for the disposal of such waste and spent fuel;
<P>
(3) to define the relationship between the Federal Government
and the State governments with respect to the disposal of such
waste and spent fuel; and
<P>
(4) to establish a Nuclear Waste Fund, composed of payments made
by the generators and owners of such waste and spent fuel, that
will ensure that the costs of carrying out activities relating
to the disposal of such waste and spent fuel will be borne by
the persons responsible for generating such waste and spent fuel.
<P>
[42 U.S.C. 10131]
<H4><A NAME="SEC112">RECOMMENDATION</A> OF CANDIDATE SITES FOR
SITE CHARACTERIZATION</H4>

<P>
Sec. 112. (a) Guidelines. Not later than 180 days after the date
of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Secretary,
following consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality,
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Director of the Geological Survey, and interested Governors, and
the concurrence of the Commission shall issue general guidelines
for the recommendation of sites for repositories. Such guidelines
shall specify detailed geologic considerations that shall be primary
criteria for the selection of sites in various geologic media.
Such guidelines shall specify factors that qualify or disqualify
any site from development as a repository, including factors pertaining
to the location of valuable natural resources, hydrology, geophysics,
seismic activity, and atomic energy defense activities, proximity
to water supplies, proximity to populations, the effect upon the
rights of users of water, and proximity to components of the National
Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Wilderness Preservation
System, or National Forest Lands. Such guidelines shall take into
consideration the proximity to sites where high-level radioactive
waste and spent nuclear fuel is generated or temporarily stored
and the transportation and safety factors involved in moving such
waste to a repository. Such guidelines shall specify population
factors that will disqualify any site from development as a repository
if any surface facility of such repository would be located (1)
in a highly populated area; or (2) adjacent to an area 1 mile
by 1 mile having a population of not less than 1,000 individuals.
Such guidelines also shall require the Secretary to consider the
cost and impact of transporting to the repository site the solidified
high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel to be disposed of
in the repository and the advantages of regional distribution
in the siting of repositories. Such guidelines shall require the
Secretary to consider the various geologic media in which sites
for repositories may be located and, to the extent practicable,
to recommend sites in different geologic media. The Secretary
shall use guidelines established under this subsection in considering
candidate sites for recommendation under subsection (b). The Secretary
may revise such guidelines from time to time, consistent with
the provisions of this subsection.
<P>
(b) Recommendation by Secretary to the President.
<P>
(1) (A) Following the issuance of guidelines under subsection
(a) and consultation with the Governors of affected States, the
Secretary shall nominate at least 5 sites that he determines suitable
for site characterization for selection of the first repository
site.
<P>
(B) Subsequent to such nomination, the Secretary shall recommend
to the President 3 of the nominated sites not later than January
1, 1985 for characterization as candidate sites.
<P>
(C) Such recommendations under subparagraph (B) shall be consistent
with the provisions of section 305 [42 U.S.C. 10225].
<P>
(D) Each nomination of a site under this subsection shall be accompanied
by an environmental assessment, which shall include a detailed
statement of the basis for such recommendation and of the probable
impacts of the site characterization activities planned for such
site, and a discussion of alternative activities relating to site
characterization that may be undertaken to avoid such impacts.
Such environmental assessment shall include
<P>
(i) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is
suitable for site characterization under the guidelines established
under subsection (a);
<P>
(ii) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is
suitable for development as a repository under each such guideline
that does not require site characterization as a prerequisite
for application of such guideline;
<P>
(iii) an evaluation by the Secretary of the effects of the site
characterization activities at such site on the public health
and safety and the environment;
<P>
(iv) a reasonable comparative evaluation by the Secretary of such
site with other sites and locations that have been considered;
<P>
(v) a description of the decision process by which such site was
recommended; and
<P>
(vi) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating
the proposed repository at such site.
<P>
(E) The issuance of any environmental assessment under this paragraph
shall be considered to be a final agency action subject to judicial
review in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of title
5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.], and section 119
[42 U.S.C. 10139]. Such judicial review shall be limited to the
sufficiency of such environmental assessment with respect to the
items described in clauses (i) through (vi) of subparagraph (E).
<P>
(F) Each environmental assessment prepared under this paragraph
shall be made available to the public.
<P>
(G) Before nominating a site, the Secretary shall notify the Governor
and legislature of the State in which such site is located, or
the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such site
is located, as the case may be, of such nomination and the basis
for such nomination.
<P>
(2) Before nominating any site the Secretary shall hold public
hearings in the vicinity of such site to inform the residents
of the area in which such site is located of the proposed nomination
of such site and to receive their comments. At such hearings,
the Secretary shall also solicit and receive any recommendations
of such residents with respect to issues that should be addressed
in the environmental assessment described in paragraph (1) and
the site characterization plan described in section 113(b)(1)
[42 U.S.C. 10133(b)(1)].
<P>
(3) In evaluating the sites nominated under this section prior
to any decision to recommend a site as a candidate site, the Secretary
shall use available geophysical, geologic, geochemical and hydrologic,
and other information and shall not conduct any preliminary borings
or excavations at a site unless (i) such preliminary boring or
excavation activities were in progress upon the date of enactment
of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983] or (ii) the Secretary certifies
that such available information from other sources, in the absence
of preliminary borings or excavations, will not be adequate to
satisfy applicable requirements of this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et
seq.] or any other law: Provided, That preliminary borings or
excavations under this section shall not exceed a diameter of
6 inches.
<P>
(c) Presidential review of recommended candidate sites.
<P>
(1) The President shall review each candidate site recommendation
made by the Secretary under subsection (b). Not later than 60
days after the submission by the Secretary of a recommendation
of a candidate site, the President, in his discretion, may either
approve or disapprove such candidate site, and shall transmit
any such decision to the Secretary and to either the Governor
and legislature of the State in which such candidate site is located,
or the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such
candidate site is located, as the case may be. If, during such
60-day period, the President fails to approve or disapprove such
candidate site, or fails to invoke his authority under paragraph
(2) to delay his decision, such candidate site shall be considered
to be approved, and the Secretary shall notify such Governor and
legislature, or governing body of the affected Indian tribe, of
the approval of such candidate site by reason of the inaction
of the President.
<P>
(2) The President may delay for not more than 6 months his decision
under paragraph (1) to approve or disapprove a candidate site,
upon determining that the information provided with the recommendation
of the Secretary is insufficient to permit a decision within the
60-day period referred to in paragraph (1). The President may
invoke his authority under this paragraph by submitting written
notice to the Congress, within such 60-day period, of his intent
to invoke such authority. If the President invokes such authority,
but fails to approve or disapprove the candidate site involved
by the end of such 6-month period, such candidate site shall be
considered to be approved, and the Secretary shall notify such
Governor and legislature, or governing body of the affected Indian
tribe, of the approval of such candidate site by reason of the
inaction of the President.
<P>
(d) Preliminary activities. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, each activity of the President or the Secretary under
this section shall be considered to be a preliminary decisionmaking
activity. No such activity shall require the preparation of an
environmental impact statement under section 102(2)(C) of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)],
or to require any environmental review under subparagraph (E)
