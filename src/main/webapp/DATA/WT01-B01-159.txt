<h2>When the shield fails: Veronica Guerin 1959-1996</h2>

By William A. Orme, Jr.
 <P>

 The little cinder-block chapel sits behind the concrete parking structure, one of several nondescript outbuildings in Dublin&#146;s small airport complex. Inside, the stained glass stations of the cross are standard-issue &#146;60s-modern, the altar a simple slab. Built for the hurried but devout traveler, it is a church without a parish, charmless and devoid of history. <P>

 But this was Veronica Guerin&#146;s chosen house of worship. It was convenient: Sunday mass was just a mile&#146;s drive from home. And its stark functionality suited her no-airs-and-graces North Dublin style. Her family knew this was where she would have wanted her services held.<P>

On the morning of June 29, the airport chapel was as crowded--and as somber--as it has ever been. Veronica Guerin&#146;s murder had shocked a nation, and her funeral mass had become a virtual affair of state. The president, prime minister, and head of the armed forces sat silently in the left front pew. Other dignitaries vied with television crews for standing room. The archbishop spoke. But most of the mourners were her friends, relatives, and newspaper colleagues. The overwhelming feeling was that of a close-knit and immensely bereaved family. Her husband, Graham Turley, stood facing the casket flanked by their 6-year-old son Cathal and three slightly older nephews, who struggled to contain their tears. <P>

 At the midpoint of the mass--the offertory--Cathal and his cousins were ushered into the corner vestry. A tin whistler began an air. The small boys filed slowly back, each cradling one of Veronica&#146;s prized possessions. One by one, they placed them on the altar: Her wedding album. A ball autographed by Ireland&#146;s World Cup team. A photograph of Veronica with Manchester United&#146;s star striker. (She was a famously obsessed soccer fan.) And finally, the etched glass CPJ International Press Freedom Award plaque she had been presented in New York just six months before. <P>

Since 1991, CPJ has presented 23 of these awards to journalists who have demonstrated exemplary courage and dedication to their craft in the face of threats and violence. We hope the plaques will serve not just as a deserved honor, but as a kind of shield. By surrounding the awardees with eminent U.S. news figures and getting their stories spotlighted in the press, we want to show their nemeses that these journalists have many friends, and that their friends will let the world know should any harm befall them.<P>

 The shield is imperfect, of course. Zambian editor Fred M&#146;membe also received an International Press Freedom Award in December, but that didn&#146;t keep the Chiluba government from jailing him in January. Nosa Igiebor, an award recipient in 1993, was imprisoned without charges for six months this year by Nigeria&#146;s military rulers. <P>

 <!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 align=right  SRC="ver1.jpg">Never before, though, had an International Press Freedom Award winner been murdered. Veronica Guerin&#146;s death was a stunning, sobering reminder of the Committee&#146;s ultimate inability to carry out our self-appointed mission of protecting journalists.<P>

 Nearly every week, a journalist somewhere in the world is killed. Veronica Guerin was the 24th journalist to die in the line of duty in 1996. All but seven of these cases were deliberate murders. The assassins have in almost every instance escaped detection, or at least prosecution. But few of these killings received much international attention. This death had a special impact--in part because it occurred in a generally peaceful (and English-speaking) corner of democratic Western Europe, and in part because Guerin, as a tenacious and fundamentally nonideological crime reporter, was an instantly recognizable character type to anybody in the news business. <P>

 Her award was also a factor. The ceremony in Manhattan last year widened the circle of those who felt personally shocked and angered by her murder. Her death was covered by the leading American news organizations and had reverberations outside the United States as well. Russia&#146;s most prominent anchorman, Yevgeny Kiselyov, a fellow 1995 award winner, spoke in Moscow about the crime. M&#146;membe&#146;s daily in Zambia, <CITE>The Post</CITE>, headlined the killing of Veronica Guerin.<P>

 Her Irish colleagues told us they had seen her award as a kind of vindication. They were gratified that her courage and her sacrifice were recognized beyond Ireland&#146;s shores. And as a practical political fact, foreign coverage intensifies the already acute pressure on Irish authorities to locate and prosecute her killers. The stories about Veronica Guerin also brought overdue attention to the brazen willingness of criminal gangs from Medell&iacute;n to Moscow to murder reporters and editors who get in their way. <P>

 M&#146;membe&#146;s press freedom prize  didn&#146;t protect him fully from Zambia&#146;s jailers, but it helped CPJ mount an ultimately successful international campaign for his release. Journalists and human rights activists around the world were similarly mobilized on behalf of Igiebor, who was finally freed in June. CPJ&#146;s award did not deter Guerin&#146;s killers, but it ensured that their crime and its victim won&#146;t be forgotten. <br>
