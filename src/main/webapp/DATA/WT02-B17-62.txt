<H2>Energy Efficient Standards for Appliances and Lighting
Equipment</H2>
<H3>Overview</H3>

<P><B>Investing in energy-efficient
appliances</B>, lighting, and office equipment is one of the most
cost-effective ways to reduce wasteful energy use in the residential,
commercial, and industrial sectors.  Establishing minimum efficiency
standards is a proven way to realize energy savings.  In mandating
appliance, office, and lighting energy performance requirements,
national governments can boost energy efficiency, enhance consumer
welfare, and meet climate change goals of reduced carbon emissions. 
Efficiency standards can also help make domestic appliance and lighting
manufacturers more competitive in the global marketplace.
</P>

<P>In the United States, consumer savings benefit the national
economy by $1000 for every federal dollar spent on efficiency standards.
 Consumers themselves realize benefits which are, on average, more than
three times as great as incremental equipment costs.  By 2015, existing
standards will have saved over 46 exa-joules of primary energy. 
Discounted at 7%, the net present value of all existing standards is
$117 billion.</P>
