<h2>SEA ICE AND POLAR OCEANOGRAPHY GROUP</h2>

Head of Group : Dr P Wadhams (Reader in Polar Studies)<p> 

1995-96 Report<p>

During 1995-6 the Sea Ice and Polar Oceanography group continued as 
a large and diverse research group in the Institute. Work was undertaken on 
four EC research projects, one project funded by the US Office of Naval 
Research and two by NERC.<p>

The largest project was the European Subpolar Ocean Programme (ESOP), 
funded by the EC under the MAST-II initiative, with Dr Wadhams as Co-ordinator. 
The project involves 22 institutions from 7 European countries, and is the fourth 
largest project in MAST-II. Its aim is to understand sea ice - ocean interactions in the 
Greenland Sea, in particular the processes which undelie winter convection and the 
thermohaline circulation. The effect of convection on the carbon cycle also forms an 
important part of the project. During the year the Institute was represented at the 
MAST Days and EUROMAR Market symposium in Sorrento, Italy, in November 
1995, and on 24-26 April 1996 Dr Wadhams held a Final Symposium for the project 
at SPRI. In connection with the results of this project, which show that deep 
convection has ceased in the Greenland Sea under the effects of global warming, Dr 
Wadhams made several TV and radio appearances during spring 1996, accompanied 
by a number of newspaper articles in the British, European and US press.<p>

The project is due to last until December 1996, but overlapping it is ESOP-2, 
a successor programme under MAST-III which began in February 1996 and in which 
Dr Wadhams is a Principal Investigator. This continues the work of ESOP for three 
more years, focusing on the oceanography of the thermohaline circulation. Dr 
Wadhams is on the Steering Committee of the project an attended meetings in 
Copenhagen in January 1996 and Voss (Norway) in March 1996.<p>

Dr Wadhams has also been Principal Investigator of an EC research project in 
the Environment Programme, shared with IMGA-CNR in Modena (Dr Flavio 
Parmiggiani). The purpose is to measure the thickness of frazil and pancake ice in the 
Greenland Sea by analysing the change in the wavelength and direction of ocean 
waves as they enter the ice. This involves the spectral analysis of synthetic aperture 
radar (SAR) imagery from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites. Again, Dr Wadhams held 
a symposium at SPRI on the project on 2 May 1996, attended by Prof Klaus 
Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institut für Meteorologie, Hamburg, originator of the 
SAR wave spectrum algorithm. This project continues until December 1996. An 
earlier meeting was held in Brussels in February 1996.<p>

The fourth EC programme is another new one under MAST-III which also 
began in February 1996 for three years. It is called "Ice State", co-ordinated by 
Helsinki University of Technology with Dr Wadhams as a Principal Investigator, and 
it seks to understand the relationship between sea ice mechanical processes and the 
resistance offered by an ice sheet to ship passage. Dr Wadhams attended the opening 
meeting in Helsinki in January 1996. The first  science meeting of the project was 
hosted by Dr Wadhams at SPRI on June 6-7 1996.<p>

The two NERC projects were both completed in 1995-6. They concerned light 
penetration through sea ice and its influence on the average light availability in the 
marginal ice zone (MIZ), a quantity of great importance for determining the onset of 
the spring plankton bloom. The final work on the project comprised the construction 
of a model for irradiance in the MIZ, based on our field results from Antarctica and 
Alaska of light penetration through ice, and knowledge of ice dynamics, 
concentrations and floe sizes in the MIZ. The larger of the two grants was a BAS 
Special Topic project carried out jointly with Dr Julian Priddle of BAS.<p>

The ONR project concerns interpretation of data gathered in 1994-5 on the 
SIMI programme (Sea Ice Mechanics Initiative), an ice camp in the Beaufort Sea 
north of Alaska in which SPRI measured ice tilt, heave, strain and accelerations in 
conjunction with other groups measuring stress and ice dynamical parameters. The 
interpretation includes the role of ridge-building in generating wave activity, and the 
flexural response of the ice sheet to the tidal cycle. Dr Wadhams attended a workshop 
on the project in Seattle in April 1996.<p>

During the year Douglas Low completed an MSc thesis on "The validation of 
ERS-1 SAR data for Antarctic summer sea ice" for the University of Dundee, 
supervised by Dr Wadhams. Finlo Cottier joined the group as a research student in 
October 1995 to work on brine dranage channels in sea ice; and Yevgeny Aksenov 
joined the group as a research student in April 1996 to work on the Ice State project, 
having formerly been a research scientist at Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St 
Petersburg.<p>
