FINES TOTALING $258,000
LEVIED BY NASD AGAINST
WORTHEN RESPONDENTS

     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000
against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several of
its officers and registered representatives in connection with
the sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,
derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and Related
Cases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).

     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit against
Worthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted as
safe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fund
sales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthen
banks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year along
with Worthen Investments.

     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQ
Stock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.

     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individual
respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations against
them, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by the
Association's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.

     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that they
made, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to their
customers about the characteristics and safety features of the
mutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition to
conducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,
Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligence
in connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fund
products."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies of
all customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system.

     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  In
addition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additional
sanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of all
internal policies and an agreement to form an investment
committee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthen
personnel to market all securities.  The committee is to
especially consider the suitability of sales literature to
promote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results of
the independent audit and investment committee reviews are
subject to NASD inspection.

     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,
Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen's
executive vice president and former compliance officer.

     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-year
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in all
capacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he bore
responsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to public
customers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,
NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sent
misleading sales correspondence to public customers that
misstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fund
investments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who use
such correspondence, NASD said.

     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-day
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as a
principal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findings
that he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondence
that misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  In
addition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies of
customer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm's
files and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.

     Higher fines were levied against the seven representatives
who were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highest
amount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,
and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, the
seven representatives were fined $130,900.

     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., which
was the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.

     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with the
investigation "and promptly instituted new policies and
procedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent future
violations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banks
but did not change the name of the investment company after
acquiring the Worthen enterprises.)

CFTC DISMISSES NUMEROUS
'FRIVOLOUS' MOTIONS IN
NFA DISCIPLINARY CASE

     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a Dec. 1 order
tossed out 59 motions filed by J&J Development Corp. and affirmed
a National Futures Association (NFA) decision that imposed a fine
of $2,000 against J&J for failure to keep timely financial
statements.  J&J Development Corp. v. National Futures
Association, No. CRAA-95-2 (CFTC).

     Calling J&J's numerous filings "egregious," the CFTC said
they were prohibited under CFR Section 171.10(d).

     The numerous motions began after J&J appealed an NFA
decision that sanctioned the company for not filing financial
statements seven times between June 1990 and August 1992.  The
CFTC said J&J began its blizzard of motions with a monster brief
that was four times longer than permitted under CFTC regulations
and contained 456 exhibits.

     The CFTC noted that the brief was followed by the filing of
59 motions between January 1995 and July 1995.  The motions
generally reiterated points made in the brief, the CFTC said.

     "[R]ule 171.10(d) itself provides that 'frivolous or
repetitive motions dealing with the same subject matter shall not
be permitted,'" the CFTC said.  "We find that most of appellant's
pleadings in fact are the very sort of filings that Rule
171.10(d) is intended to prohibit.  Although we decline to impose
sanctions pursuant to Rule 171.11, we admonish J&J for its
egregious abuse of the process."

     The CFTC noted that J&J's motions fell into three general
categories.  Most of them were made up of arguments already
contained in the brief.  A second category was composed of
procedural arguments, and a third responded to NFA's opposition
brief.

     The NFA also filed procedural motions, which included a
motion to strike J&J's brief and exhibits.  The motions were
dismissed as moot following the CFTC's ruling in favor of the
NFA.

     "[O]ur review of the record and the parties' appellate
submissions establishes that NFA's findings and conclusions are
supported by the weight of the evidence; we therefore adopt
them," the CFTC said.  "We further conclude that NFA committed no
error material to the outcome of this proceeding, and the parties
have not raised any issues that merit extended discussion.
Accordingly, we affirm NFA's decision without opinion."

SIXTH CIRCUIT: INVESTORS'
CLAIMS AGAINST BROKER
ARE TIME-BARRED

     Disgruntled investors in high-risk limited partnerships
cannot arbitrate their claims against a brokerage firm because
the six-year statute of limitations has passed, a divided panel
of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 27.  Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. v. M.C. McCoy et al., No. 94-5779
(6th Cir.).

     In a 2-1 decision, the majority said the limitations period
began to run when the investments were made and when the
investors received prospectuses that clearly outlined the
substantial risks, not when the investments later soured.

     The dissenting judge found a material factual issue for
trial on the investors' argument that the limitations period was
equitably tolled because the brokerage firm fraudulently
concealed the unsuitable nature of the investments.  The
dissenter also said the National Association of Security Dealers
(NASD) Code of Arbitration Procedure does not bar equitable
tolling of the Section 15 limitations period.

     The investors, described as unsophisticated retirees, stated
that their primary goals were preservation of principal and a
steady income stream.  They were allegedly told by Dean Witter
Reynolds that limited partnerships would meet those goals and
were promised 20% returns and safety.  The NASD Code of
Arbitration Procedure with its six-year time period was
incorporated by reference and stipulation into their agreements.

     Dean Witter subsequently filed a declaratory judgment
complaint in the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging that
claims for improper investments were time-barred.  The investors
were permanently enjoined from litigation and arbitration.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a majority opinion by Judge
Alice M. Batchelder.  The arbitration claims were filed more than
six years after the investments were made and the clock began
ticking, the court said, not when they later allegedly discovered
the unsuitability of the investments.  Adopting the investors'
reasoning would undermine Section 15's intent of setting a
six-year limit on the arbitrability of claims, it said.

     The majority also found the prospectuses to be clearly
worded and not misleading, even to novice investors.

     It found no need to decide whether Section 15 is subject to
equitable tolling, saying the investors failed to offer
sufficient evidence of fraudulent concealment.

     In a dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore found a material
factual issue as to whether Dean Witter had engaged in fraudulent
concealment.  She also said the equitable tolling doctrine
applies to claims filed more than six years after an investment
in unsuitable securities.

     The due diligence requirement may be relaxed when a
confidential or fiduciary relationship exists, she said, and the
prospectuses in this case are neither clear nor comprehensive.
She also noted that a Dean Witter agent took the initiative to
meet with the investors, reassured them their goals would be met
and made other statements that were gross exaggerations or
clearly capricious.

     In addition, Section 15 does not bar an equitable tolling
claim in Judge Moore's view because there was no evidence these
investors agreed to waive their right to use the equitable
tolling doctrine.

SEC SUIT REMAINS INTACT
DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT
'SECURITIES' DEFINITION

     Noting that a question may ultimately exist as to whether
the instruments used in multimillion-dollar transactions by the
Foundation for New Era Philanthropy are securities under federal
law, Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Anita B. Brody on
Nov. 16 denied former New Era president John G. Bennett's motion
to dismiss on that point and issued a discovery schedule.  SEC v.
Bennett et al., No. 95-3005 (ED PA); see Securities & Insider
Trading LR, Aug. 21, 1995.

     The motion by Bennett for a more definitive statement of SEC
charges that he and New Era sold more than $100 million in
unregistered securities in 1993 alone was denied by Judge Brody
because Bennett "has not made clear the substance of his
objections."

     Bennett argued that the crux of the SEC's complaint is
whether the New Era notes are securities within the meaning of
the federal securities laws.  Under every criteria, Bennett
contends, the notes fail to qualify as securities, i.e., as
notes, investment contracts and other evidence of indebtedness.

     Judge Brody stated she was unable to say at this point
whether the legal test for registered securities has been met.
After discovery has been completed, the judge ruled, Bennett may
again raise the issue and the parties at that time will address
the economic realities of the transaction.

     Regarding the motion for a more definitive statement from
the SEC, the judge stated that the defects to which Bennett
alludes are not obvious and that plaintiff did not have to
respond to allusions to theories of potential liability in the
complaint, only to factual allegations.  Because Bennett did not
comply with Rule 12(e), which requires him to point out the
defects complained of and the details desired, he has not made
clear the substance of his objections, Judge Brody stated.

     Bennett is represented by Gregory Miller, Daniel Joanas and
Gino Benedetti of Miller, Alfano & Raspanti in Philadelphia.

SUP. CT. HEARS FINALITY OF
PACT v. DE REPRESENTATION
ADEQUACY ARGUMENTS

     In arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court Nov. 27,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Ltd. argued that if the Ninth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' invalidation of a Delaware state
court settlement of shareholder claims against it is not
overturned, corporations will have no assurance of the finality
of state court settlements that include federal securities law
charges.  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. et al. v.
Epstein et al., No. 94-1809 (U.S.).

     Shareholder attorneys countered that Section 27 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which gives federal courts
exclusive jurisdiction to enforce any liability, prevented such a
settlement -- especially where the securities law claims were not
litigated and were based on different wrongs than those at the
heart of the state law breach of duty allegations.

     In 1990, Matsushita acquired MCA Inc. for $6.1 billion.  The
acquisition was accomplished through a tender offer of $71 per
share of MCA common stock.

     Rather than tender his shares, Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairman
and CEO at the time, entered into a separate agreement with
Matsushita, known as the "Capital Contribution and Loan
Agreement," pursuant to which Wasserman exchanged his shares for
preferred stock in a wholly owned Matsushita subsidiary called
MEA Holdings.  Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's COO at the time, tendered
his shares pursuant to Matsushita's $71 per share offer.  Two
days after Sheinberg tendered his shares, he received an
additional $21 million in cash, ostensibly in exchange for
unexercised MCA stock options.

     Subsequently, former MCA shareholders who tendered their
shares for the $71 tender price filed suit in the U.S. District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging that
Matsushita violated SEC Rule 14d-10 by treating Wasserman and
Sheinberg differently from other shareholders in the tender
offer.

     The district court granted Matsushita summary judgment on
class action plaintiff representative Lawrence Epstein's claim
that Matsushita's agreement to pay Wasserman consideration that
was different from the $71 per share tender offer violated
Rule 14d-10.  The trial court subsequently granted Matsushita's
motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims.
Appeals were filed.

     During the pendency of the consolidated appeals, the
Delaware Chancery Court entered a judgment approving the
settlement of a state court class action that released all claims
arising out of Matsushita's tender offer for MCA stock --
including the securities law charges.

     The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order
denying plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment against
Matsushita on the Wasserman claim.  The panel also vacated the
district's court's order granting Matsushita's motion for summary
judgment on the Sheinberg payment.

     In addition, the appeals court held that the Delaware
judgment does not preclude the Epstein class action.  Finally,
the panel vacated the district court's orders denying the Epstein
plaintiffs' motions for class certification and for leave to
amend their complaint.

     In its petition for writ of certiorari, Matsushita asserted
that the circuit court created an anomalous exception to the Full
Faith and Credit Act that will frustrate the settlement of class
action litigation.  It also argued that implying a private right
of action under Rule 14d-10 violates principles announced by the
Supreme Court and conflicts with decisions of the District of
Columbia, Third and Sixth Circuits.  Furthermore, Matsushita
contended that the circuit court expanded Rule 14d-10 in conflict
with the law in the Fourth Circuit and the tender offer
regulatory scheme created by Congress.

     Walter Minton, one of the plaintiffs, filed a separate brief
in opposition, arguing that this is an appeal from an
interlocutory decision, not a final judgment, and the issues
presented arise because of the unique facts of the case.  Minton
also stated that there is no need for the Supreme Court to decide
whether there is a private right of action under Rule 14d-10.

     In a Feb. 13, 1993 opinion that followed a fairness hearing
on the proposed settlement by objectors, then Vice Chancellor
Maurice Hartnett noted that a "whiff of collusion" was not enough
to bar approval, especially since the pact -- in a revised form -
- had an opt-out provision.

     The justices asked plaintiff attorneys why the California
objectors had not opted out of the settlement instead of
attacking it collaterally.  Plaintiff's attorneys argued that the
Delaware Chancery Court made no inquiry into the adequacy of
representation, thereby inviting a challenge to the settlement.

     Nevertheless, some justices questioned the assertion that
only a federal court could release federal securities claims.

     Counsel for Matsushita are Barry R. Ostranger, Mary Kay
Vyskocil, Paul C. Curnin and Joseph M. McLaughlin of Simpson,
Thatcher & Bartlett in New York City.  Of counsel is Geoffrey
Hazard Jr., Trustee Professor of Law, University of Pennsylvania.

     Epstein is represented by Roger Kirby, Irving Malchman and
Peter Linden of Kaufman, Malchman, Kirby & Squire and Henry Paul
Monaghan and Harold Edgar, both in New York City.

     Representing Minton are Peter R. Dion-Kindem and Laurence M.
Berman of Berman, Blanchard, Mausner, Kindem & Resser in Los
Angeles.

CFTC FINDS DEFENDANT'S
BID TO VACATE DECISION
DID NOT FIT RULE 60(b)

     Although Steven C. Brenner claimed that sanctions leveled
against him by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be
lifted because he satisfied a judgment, the CFTC ruled Nov. 11
that Brenner's motion to set aside a final decision had been
filed too late for him to obtain relief under FRCP 60(b).  In the
Matter of Steven C. Brenner, No. 90-7 (CFTC).

     "To obtain such relief, generally a party must first
demonstrate that he acted within a reasonable time and show a
meritorious defense," the CFTC said, noting that Brenner's motion
involved a decision rendered four years ago.  The CFTC pointed
out that a Rule 60(b) motion must be made "not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken."

     In 1986, the CFTC ordered Brenner to pay a judgment of
$5,987.20 to a complainant.  There was no record of Brenner's
making the payment by early 1987, and he was automatically
prohibited from trading on any contract market.  The CFTC
Enforcement Division, however, learned in 1990 that Brenner had
violated the trading prohibition in 1987 and 1988.

     The Enforcement Division moved for a summary disposition.
Brenner did not respond to the charges nor did he appear at a
consequent hearing before an administrative law judge.  The ALJ
found Brenner liable on the charges and imposed a 10-year trading
ban and a $10,000 civil monetary penalty.  Brenner did not seek a
modification, and the summary disposition became a final order.
Brenner did not appeal the order to the CFTC, and the case was
closed.

     In June 1992, the CFTC was informed that Brenner was trading
under a fictitious name.  The Enforcement Division sought and was
granted an injunction prohibiting Brenner from trading futures by
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

     Brenner responded in February by asking the CFTC to set
aside the sanctions on grounds he had paid the $5,987.20 judgment
in 1987.  He argued that his attorney had been incompetent for
not bringing the satisfaction of the judgment to the proper CFTC
authorities.  The complainant alleged that he was not paid until
1994.

               The Enforcement Division argued that Brenner's motion should
be denied because he had failed to demonstrate the "exceptional
circumstances" necessary for the granting of relief under
Rule 60(b).   The CFTC, however, found that Brenner did not reach
Rule 60(b) because he brought his action well after the one-year
limitation period.

     "[W]e initially note that the sanctions Brenner seeks to
have vacated were imposed four and half years prior to the
instant motion.  Nevertheless, Brenner offers no explanation for
the delay in presenting the evidence he now asks us to consider.
Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his motion has
been filed within a reasonable time."

     The CFTC noted that even if the action had been brought
within the period of limitation, relief under Rule 60(b) cannot
be granted based on the incompetence of a defendant's attorney.
Quoting Nelson v. City College of Chicago, 962 F.2d at 755
(7th Cir.), the CFTC said the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals has "never held that an attorney's gross negligence
justifies relief under Rule 60(b)."

INVESTORS SAY RECEIVER
LACKED AUTHORITY TO SELL
SECURITIES-BACKED ASSETS

     A group of California securities investors argued in a
Nov. 20 brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that the
Central District of California went beyond its jurisdiction in
approving a receiver's sale of real estate that the investors
claimed they owned through the purchase of securities.  SEC v.
American Capital Investments, Inc.; The ACI Investors Association
et al. v. Shaffer, Nos. 95-55193, 95-55283, 95-5587 and 95-55878
(9th Cir.).

     "The Receiver cannot sell the Investors' interests in the
properties because they are not within the Court's jurisdiction,"
the investors argued.  "Under binding recent Supreme Court
precedent (O'Melveny & Myers v. F.D.I.C...), the Court must look
to State law to define its remedial jurisdiction in Receivership
cases.  Under California law -- as well as all other
jurisdictions -- a Receiver steps into the shoes of the defendant
for whom he is appointed and brings into custodia legis only the
same quality and quantity of title as was owned by the
defendant."

     The case began in August 1993 when the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging securities fraud
against American Capital Investments, Inc. (ACI), which had been
selling securities interests in real estate investments.  By the
time the SEC obtained a restraining order, 156 investors had
purchased securities backed by commercial real estate.

               The investors -- later organized as the ACI Investors
Association -- claimed they held title to the property directly
through deeds and indirectly through partnerships with ACI.  The
jurisdictional issue presently before the Ninth Circuit had its
genesis in the September 1993 federal court appointment of
Richard G. Shaffer as ACI's receiver.  Shaffer took over ACI's
real estate assets and sold the properties to a Canadian
investment firm.

     According to the investors' opening brief, "The investors
contend that no one can sell what he does not own.  The Receiver
seeks to sell 100 percent fee interests in eight ACI
commercial/office properties -- despite that fact that ACI did
not own 100 percent fee interests.  The investors own major
interests in at least four of the eight properties...."

     The investors claimed the Central District of California did
not have jurisdiction to approve the sale and appealed to the
Ninth Circuit.

     Citing to O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct. 2048 (1994),
which had relied in part on Allen v. Ramsay, 179 Cal.App.2d 843,
4 Cal.Rptr. 575 (1960), the investors argued that federal courts
do not have the power to displace state law in cases involving
the authority of receivers.

     "There is no principle of California law which would permit
a Receiver to sell a better state of title than he acquired when
'he stepped into the shoes' of the Defendant," the investors
argued.  "Applying the law to this case, there is no power to
convey a better title to the ACI properties than ACI itself had
and the district court's sale order is therefore void."

     The appellant investors are represented by Thomas W.
Dressler and Patrick J. Evans of Dressler, Rein & Evans in Los
Angeles.

OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASD
EXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASE
INVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM

     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned a
securities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in a
Nov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
that the National Association of Securities Dealers stretched
beyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involving
a misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securities
and Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).

     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceeds
the power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks to
impose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investment
banking or securities business for his alleged failure to act in
his corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"
according to the brief.

     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-
based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument on
allegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporations
law by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-
chartered, non-NASD member private business.

     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reserved
under the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued.
"Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law and
the relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to state
law....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs of
private corporations and federal law shall not intrude into those
internal affairs."

     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for
$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrine
corporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-
owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.
(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check for
the full amount to the AIFC customer.

     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld payment
for two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation was
unsupported.

     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of a
disciplinary action against Alderman by the District Business
Conduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being an
officer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vice
president.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC found
Alderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.

    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of his
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade."

     According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and fined
him $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD's
National Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed the
DBCC.

     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladder
when Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealed
to the Ninth Circuit.

      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.
2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law -- not
the NASD -- governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.
Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371
allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of the
company.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bank
accounts fell to a vice president for finance and not to
Alderman, the brief argued.

      "The standards to which directors are held are established
by state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent and
prudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearly
recognized that the Board's responsibility is limited to
overseeing the operation."

     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.
The SEC is represented by Randall W. Quinn, Senior Litigation
Counsel for the SEC in Washington, DC.

CFTC FILES COMPLAINT
AGAINST ILLINOIS TRADER
FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has filed a six-
count administrative complaint against Gary K. Bielfeldt,
Carlotta Bielfeldt and Bielfeldt & Co., of Peoria and Chicago,
for alleged violations of the Commodity Futures Act (CFA) that
included exceeding speculative limits and filing false reports,
the CFTC said.

     The Oct. 31 complaint charged in counts one and two that
Gary Bielfeldt, a registered floor broker, allegedly violated the
CFTC's speculative limits for corn futures trading between
Oct. 8, 1993 and Nov. 19, 1993.

     The complaint claimed that Bielfeldt violated speculative
limits rules in two basic ways: by acting pursuant to an express
or implied agreement with his daughters, Linda Bielfeldt and
Karen Gray, and several business and social acquaintances; and,
by controlling the trading in commodity futures trading accounts
of Carlotta Bielfeldt, his wife, who was never registered with
the CFTC in any capacity.

     The CFTC said that counts three through six charged the
defendants with filing false reports.  Gary Bielfeldt,
controlling person of Bielfeldt & Co., was charged with filing
false reports with the CFTC for: (1) identifying his wife as a
reportable trader; (2) filing false 01 Reports that failed to
combine the net positions of the accounts controlled by Gary
Bielfeldt with the positions in the accounts of Carlotta
Bielfeldt; and (3) failing to update his CFTC Form 40 to
accurately reflect his control of the accounts of Carlotta
Bielfeldt.

     Carlotta Bielfeldt was charged with making a false statement
of material fact to the CFTC for allegedly signing a CFTC Form 40
that failed to identify Gary Bielfeldt as controlling her
account.  Bielfeldt & Co. was charged with filing a false CFTC
Form 102 and false 01 Reports with the CFTC.
