<P>The information given in these pages is intended to be as correct
as possible, but if there is any discrepency between the information
given here and the information given in the "University Calandar", 
the latter takes precedence.

<H2>B.SC AND B.SC(HONS)</H2>
<P>
The B.Sc degree of the Northern Territory University was 
introduced in 1990. The <A HREF="hondegree.html">B.Sc(Hons) degree</A>
was offered for the first time in 1991.
<P>
A total of 240 credit points are required for a B.Sc. Pass 
Degree including at least 60 credit points at P level or better 
from third level subjects.  No more than 100 credit points from 
first level courses may be included.  A normal program would 
include 80 credit points from first level subjects.
<P>
These very general requirements are designed to provide 
students with maximum freedom of choice in their course 
structure.  Some students may work to pursue a very general 
course, selecting subjects in many different disciplines; 
others may choose a very narrow course spreading in only 
one subject area (eg Chemistry).
<P>
You may select courses in Chemistry in such a way that your 
degree certificate will be marked "Major in Chemistry" or 
"Minor in Chemistry". You can also obtain a major in two 
disciplines.  To obtain a minor in chemistry, you must complete 
60 credit points at P level or better in Chemistry including 
20 credit points from third level subjects.
<P>
To major in Chemistry, you must obtain 40 credit points from 
chemistry courses at third level at P level or above, along 
with all required prerequisites and 20 credit points in 
Mathematics or Physics.  An interdisciplinary major in 
Chemistry and Biochemistry is similar with 20 credit points 
from third level chemistry courses replaced by 20 credit 
points from third level biochemistry courses.  
<P>
A major in Chemistry leads to qualifications as a professional 
chemist and a career in teaching, industry or research.  It 
meets the requirements of the <A HREF="/raci/index.html">
Royal Australian Chemical Institute</A> for Graduate Membership 
and, after four years of experience, for Associate Membership.
<P>
Students who have completed units in the University of 
Queensland B.Sc or the B.App.Sc (both taught up to 1991) 
will be given credit for these units towards the NTU B Sc. 
This will be on the basis that 12 credit points in the 
University of Queensland B.Sc will be equivalent to 10 
credit points of the NTU B.Sc.
<P>
There are chemistry components in the <A HREF="joint.html">joint degrees</A>, 
B. Eng. / B. Sc.,   B. Sc. / B. Econ. and B. Sc. / LL.B. 
<P>
Holders of the <A HREF="diploma.html">Associate Diploma</A> in
Applied Science may obtain <A HREF="articulate.html">exemptions</A>
for up to 80 credit points towards the requirements of the B Sc.

<H2>B Sc CHEMISTRY UNITS</H2>
<P>
<H3>LEVEL 1</H3><P>

These two units, which should be considered together with students 
strongly encouraged to take both, are designed to give students a 
thorough and broad introduction to modern chemistry, providing 
a basis either for continued work in chemistry at degree or 
associate diploma level or for using chemistry in other 
disciplines. Year 12 Chemistry is assumed knowledge.

<P>The policy is that a grade of PT (Pass Terminal) is just 
that - a terminal pass. It does not qualify for prerequisite 
purposes.  However, for some units, particularly for SCH101, 
a PC (Pass Conceded) grade may be used and this is accepted 
for prerequisite purposes.

<P>
<H3><B> MAJORS:</B></H3><P>
At least 40 credit points from third level Chemistry units at
a grade of P or better.  <P>

There is a joint major in Chemistry and Biochemistry that requires
at least 20 credit points from third level units in each of the two
areas of study. See the Calendar for details.<P>

There is a new <A HREF="mm_major.html">joint major in
mathematical modelling of physical and chemical systems</A> which
can contain some chemistry.<P>

</B><H3><B> MINORS:</B></H3><P>
60 credit points at grade P or above in SCH units including at least 20 credit
points selected from third level Chemistry.   <P>
