<img src="../caps/lcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="L">ong before the first refrigerated container was unloaded in Saigon, foreign traders made their way to Hoi An just south of Danang, in central Vietnam's Quang-Nam Province. Dutch, Japanese, French, and Malaysian merchants headed here in the early 19th century, to trade silks, spices and wood. With the third largest deep water port in Vietnam, lower labor costs than other industrial areas, and proximity to the Central Highlands, Laos, and northeastern Thailand, Danang has begun to attract foreign commercial interests once again.<p>

One of the most ambitious plans to tap the area's trade opportunities is the development of the An Don Export Processing and Industrial Zone. The An Don EPZ is administered by MASSDA, a joint venture between a Malaysian consortium and the Danang Export and Industrial Zone (DEPIZA).<p>

For exporters, the EPZ offers several advantages. The EPZ has a customs check point inside the premises that works exclusively with tenants to facilitate export procedures, reducing lead time to shipping and decreasing associated customs charges. Outside of the zone, a company wishing to export would have to go through customs procedures at the port, a very time consuming and often expensive endeavor. Like other EPZs, imported materials used for exports are not subject to tariffs and in some cases, companies are permitted to sell a small portion of their imports or finished goods domestically.<p>

Why does Danang hold so much potential in the eyes of the Malaysian group and others? One reason is Danang's port capabilities. The Tien Sa Seaport is the third largest deep water port in Vietnam. Tien Sa can accommodate up to four ships of 20,000-27,000 Dwt. Additionally, there is 15,000 m2 in warehousing capacity. The road from the An Don EPZ to Tien Sa is paved and congestion free; the EPZ is only 6 km from Tien Sa. According to Nguyen Dang Lam, managing director of DEPIZA , the Lien Chieu seaport is in the planning stages and work on this project is reported to begin in 1997. The Vietnamese government is planning to build Lien Chieu Seaport with an estimated handling capacity of 20 million metric tons per year by 2000. The Han River port, several kilometers up river, allows ships with 3000-5000 Dwt to literally dock at the City center.<p>

Danang, with its port capabilities, is 100 km from the Laotian border and has the potential to serve as an export conduit for that country's rich timber and mining resources. Danang offers cheaper land-use rates than Hanoi or HCMC, with current rates as low as $2.25 m2 in Danang and $150 hectare per year in more remote areas. One international banker, who deals with many Vietnamese, European, Japanese, and Singaporean companies in Danang, foresees tremendous growth in the region in the next 3-5 years. "Don't come in three years -- come in now," he advises.<p>

Michael Bradley is director of San Francisco based South China Sea Trading & Investment Services.<p>
