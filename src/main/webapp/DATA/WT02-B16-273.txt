<H2>PV With Batteries</H2>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong>
<p>PV systems with batteries operate by connecting the PV modules to
a battery, and the battery, in turn, to the load. During daylight
hours, the PV modules charge the battery. The battery supplies
power to the load whenever needed. A simple electrical device
called a charge controller keeps the batteries charged properly
and helps prolong their life by protecting them from overcharging
or from being completely drained. 

<p>Batteries make PV systems useful in more situations, but also
require some maintenance. The batteries used in PV systems are
often similar to car batteries, but are built somewhat
differently to allow more of their stored energy to be used each
day. (They are said to be "deep cycling," like the batteries used
on golf carts.) Batteries designed for PV projects pose the same
risks and demand the same caution in handling and storage as
automotive batteries. The fluid in unsealed batteries should be
checked periodically, and batteries should be protected from
extremely cold weather. 

<p>A solar generating system with batteries supplies electricity
when it is needed. How much electricity can be used after sunset
or on cloudy days is determined by the output of the PV modules
and the nature of the battery bank. Including more modules and
batteries increases system cost, so energy usage is carefully
studied to determine optimum system size. A well-designed system
balances cost and convenience to meet the user's needs, and can
be expanded if those needs change.
