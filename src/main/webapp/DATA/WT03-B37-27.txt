7TH CIRCUIT REVERSES
DISMISSAL OF LOAN
FLIPPING CLAIMS

The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 14, by a 2-1
margin, overturned a Chicago federal judge's order dismissing a
putative RICO class action brought against a finance company for
alleged loan flipping practices.  Emery v. American General
Finance
Inc., No. 95-1037 (7th Cir.).

The majority found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged
her
predicate claims of mail fraud so as to survive a motion to
dismiss.

Verna Emery first approached American General Finance for a loan
in
July 1992.  The lender issued her a three-year loan for $1,983;
the
finance charges over the term of the loan amounted to $1,327.
American General sent Emery a letter the following January,
stating
that she was entitled to borrow an additional $750.

Seeking an additional $200, Emery responded to the offer;
American
General's branch manager gave her forms for the refinancing of
her
original loan with additional funds advanced.  Emery signed a new
note for $2,399 with a finance charge of $1,641.  Emery's monthly
payments increased by roughly $20, effectively costing her $1,200
for the right to get $200 immediately.  (Such disclosure was not
required by the Truth in Lending Act, the Seventh Circuit noted,
as
the statute regards such transactions as a reborrowing of the
original loan amount.)

Emery filed her action in the Northern District of Illinois,
alleging that the lender engaged in a pattern of soliciting its
customers by mail for the loan of additional funds, without
informing them that the costs of refinancing are far greater than
those connected with taking out a separate loan.
The trial court granted the defense's dismissal motion in
December
1994, concluding that the plaintiff failed to identify any
specific
false statement of material fact allegedly made by the defendant.

The lower court also found that the plaintiff failed to cite to
any
case holding a failure to disclose actionable under the federal
mail fraud statute.

In a review authored by Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Richard A.
Posner,
the Seventh Circuit stated that "all the [mail fraud] statute
punishes is deliberate fraud."  While having no quibble with the
proposition that mere failure to disclose does not constitute
mail
fraud, the panel stated that "[w]hether a failure to disclose is
fraudulent depends on context."

Judge Posner wrote that the panel does "not of course know the
state of mind of the employees of American General Finance who
drafted the letter to Emery and its other customers; nor can the
plaintiff have more than an inkling until she has an opportunity
to
conduct pretrial discovery."  In viewing the letter in the
context
of the complaint's allegations, the court continued, "the letter
is
seen to be replete with falsehoods and half truths."

With respect to the lower court's finding that Emery failed to
allege a violation of the Truth in Lending Act, the panel stated,
"Suppose Emery were blind.  Or retarded.  Would anyone argue that
shoving a Truth in Lending Act disclosure form in front ofher
face
would be a defense to fraud?  The allegation is that she belongs
to
a class of borrowers who are not competent interpreters of such
forms and that the defendant knows this and sought to take
advantage of it," Judge Posner wrote.

As to the lower court's finding that Emery failed to plead a
fiduciary relationship between herself and the defendant, the
panel
wrote that "it is not true that if you are not a fiduciary
anything
goes, short of false statements.  A half truth, or what is
usually
the same thing a misleading omission, is actionable as fraud,
including mail fraud if the mails are used to further it, if it
is
intended to induce a false belief and resulting action to the
advantage of the misleader and the disadvantage of the misled."
The panel stated that it was not deeming loan flipping to be
fraud
or that the defendant engaged in fraud.  "All we know is that the
allegations of fraud are sufficient to withstand a motion to
dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  There is a
state of facts consistent with the complaint that if proved would
establish a violation of the mail fraud statute, and no more is
required at this stage for the suit to continue."

Judge Posner did find meritorious the defendant's alternative
arguments that Emery failed to plead mail fraud with FRCP 9(b)
particularity.  The panel found Emery's allegations of the fraud
perpetrated upon her sufficient, but that she only generally
averred that American General did the same to other customers.

The panel wrote that a Rule 9(b) dismissal would have been
proper,
but that Emery should have been given the opportunity to amend
her
complaint.  The appellate panel then reversed and remanded.

Judge William J. Bauer concurred in the judgment.

Dissenting, Judge John L. Coffey stated that "[t]he cases in
which
this court has held that  non-disclosure' may be deemed
fraudulent
all involved a special circumstance of some kind....  There were
no
such special circumstances in this case.  AGF, as Emery's
creditor,
was not a fiduciary....  AGF did not engage in a  wide variety of
deceptive actions,' nor can its conduct vis-a-vis Emery be fairly
described as an  elaborate attempt at concealment.'"

9TH CIR.: NO CLAIM BY
SHAREHOLDERS TO RECOVER
RECEIVERSHIP LOSSES

A group of bank shareholders, charging the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. with fraud on the court, will not be able to
recover funds they lost when the agency took over receivership
from
a failed bank, a panel of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
held Dec. 26.  Herring et al. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
No. CV-93-00127-EHC (9th Cir.).

The circuit court affirmed a decision of the U.S. District Court
for the District of Arizona, stating that a party with no
interest
in the litigation generally has no standing.

In September 1981, the Arizona Superintendent of Banks placed
Southwestern Bank in receivership.  On May 1, 1990, the FDIC, as
court-appointed receiver, petitioned the Arizona Superior Court
to
enter an order approving payment of a final liquidating dividend,
payment of interest on claims, sale of any newly discovered
assets,
disposal of Southwestern's books and records and termination of
the
receivership.

The shareholders, Morris Herring, Raymond Herring, James N.
Corbett, Luis Valenzuela, Armando Alfaro and Sherman Montgomery,
who had invested in the Southwestern Bank, filed objections,
complaining of faulty accounting and insufficient information
regarding the receivership and alleged $530,124 loss.  The
shareholders requested the court to order a more specific
accounting or allow shareholders leave to examine the
receivership.

After hearings and the filing of post-petition briefs, the
Superior
Cour overruled the shareholders' objections.  The court held that
the disputed item of $530,124 consisted of losses sustained on
the
liquidation of assets and that the FDIC was not subject to
surcharge for this amount.  The court further held that the FDIC
was entitled to interest on its own claim, but that the
receivership funds were insufficient to cover the FDIC's claim
even
if the $530,124 was disallowed.  On Aug. 14, 1991, the court
terminated the receivership.

After being turned down by the state Supreme Court to review
their
petition that the FDIC perpetrated a fraud on the court, the
shareholders filed with the Arizona Superior Court an independent
action pursuant to Rule 60(b) to set aside the judgment for fraud
on the court.  The FDIC removed the case to federal district
court.
The shareholders alleged that the FDIC knowingly submitted false
accounting figures when it petitioned the court to terminate
receivership and presented perjured testimony to the court
concerning a bank receivership asset account labeled "other
assets/judgments."

The FDIC moved for summary judgment.  Following briefing and oral
argument, the district court granted summary judgment on two
grounds: (1) that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the
shareholders' action, and (2) that the FDIC committed no fraud on
the court.

The circuit court found that, because the shareholders cannot
recover their funds, they have no standing.  The panel affirmed
the
district court's finding of summary judgment on their fraud on
the
court claim.

The shareholders were represented by Conrad Herring of San Diego.

The FDIC was represented by Lawrence G.D. Scarborough of Brown &
Bain in Phoenix.

CONVICTION IN ELABORATE
REAL ESTATE SCHEME IS
UPHELD IN 10TH CIRCUIT

Over the pleas of the defendants, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Jan. 5 upheld their multicount convictions in district
court arising from a complex real estate fraud, including mail
fraud, wire fraud and making false statements in connection with
the scheme.  United States v. Austin et al., No. 91-CR-147
(10th Cir.).

Defendants Donald Austin and James Grandgeorge claimed that the
U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado-imposed
restitution of $12,618,772 was too high.  Based upon defaulted
loans, the district court determined the victims of the scheme
lost
more than $20 million.  The district court also sentenced Austin
to
a term of 27 years and Grandgeorge to a term of 23 years.  Each
was
given a sentence of five years' probation following release.

The essence of the scheme was to purchase properties from
legitimate sellers.  The defendants recruited numerous people to
act as "strawmen buyers," who secured mortgages from U.S.
Mortgage
Co. which were, in turn, insured by the U.S. Department of
Housing
and Urban Development (HUD).  Despite HUD's requirement that each
purchase be funded with a minimum of 15% downpayment by the
purchasers, no such investment was made by the strawmen.

Closing documents were drawn, however, which falsely stated the
downpayments were made.  The defendants paid the strawmen $1,000
for each of the transactions in which they participated.
Although
the defendants assured the strawmen the defendants would be
responsible for the payment of loans to the properties, no such
payments were made, and the properties went into foreclosure.

The defendants incorporated Fidelity Escrow Services, which they
used as an independent entity in connection with the sales
transaction to give the transactions the appearance of
legitimacy.
The use of Fidelity convinced the loan closer on the strawmen
purchases to believe the downpayments were paid by the purchasers
in cash or certified funds.

The defendantsalso arranged for all loans to be handled through
U.S. Mortgage, which was able to charge high interest rates
because
the purchasers had no real interest in the properties.  The high
interest rate and the prospect of HUD insurance made the loans
attractive to secondary lenders.  The processing of the loans
granted by U.S. Mortgage to the strawmen was done by three people
who were paid kickbacks by the defendants.  Although the
defendants' scheme involved hundreds of properties, 157 were
identified in the indictment.

Austin contended that the district court erred in imposing
restitution upon him because there was no proof of his ability to
pay.  However, the 10th Circuit concluded that Austin did little
to
prove this claim.

ORAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN
LANDOWNER AND BANK NOT
AS BINDING AS WRITTEN

Since the alleged oral agreement between a landowner and her bank
to prevent foreclosure on her properties contradicts the terms of
the written agreement between the two parties, a California
appeals
court on Dec. 22 affirmed a trial court's grant of summary
judgment
to the bank to foreclose on the property.  Howard v. First
Nationwide Bank, No. A067566 (CA Ct. App., 1st Dist.).

The California Court of Appeal, First District, concluded that
since an alleged oral agreement between Ruth Fairley Howard and
Keith G. Becher, a First Nationwide Bank (FNB) liquidation
supervisor, directly contradicted the terms of the written
agreement between the two parties, Howard's appeal to seek a
reversal of the summary judgment by the Alameda County Superior
Court is without merit.

In 1986, Howard and her husband, Mark Howard, a commercial real
estate broker who was then in the business of buying and selling
properties for his own account, borrowed $210,000 from FNB to
purchase commercial property in Richmond.  The Howards executed a
standard promissory note and deed of trust on the property,
agreeing to pay off the loan in monthly installments and giving
FNB
the usual right to foreclose on the property if they failed to do
so.

In 1989, Mark Howard died of cancer.  The plaintiff spent two
years
caring for him and her mother, who was also terminally ill.
Howard
also struggled with her own condition, lupus.  During this
period,
the Howards' financial properties fell into disarray.  Payments
were not made to lenders, including FNB.  In June 1988, Howard
filed for bankruptcy.

Despite filing for bankruptcy, Howard continued to make payments
on
the loan to FNB for the next five months.  When the payments
stopped in November 1988, the bank moved for an order lifting the
automatic stay in the bankruptcy action so that it could begin
foreclosure on the loan's collateral.  Howard agreed to the
dissolution of the stay in exchange for FNB's agreement to defer
foreclosure for two and one-half months.

Howard resumed making payments on the loan for almost a year, but
again fell into default.  In November 1989, FNB sent her a
standard
late notice, giving her 30 days to bring the loan current.  When
Howard did not respond, FNB waited more than two months before
issuing a notice of default and electing to sell the property.
The
notice gave her three months to avoid foreclosure.

After the plaintiff did not bring the loan current, FNB scheduled
the trustee's sale for Aug. 8, 1990.  Howard asked for another
postponement and brought Fred Mangrum, a real estate broker and
friend, with her to meet with Becher.  They asked him to postpone
for sale for one month.

Howard said Mangrum would buy the Richmond property, with the
proceeds to pay off the loan and put the remainder of her
financial
affairs in order.  Although Mangrum had expressed an interest in
buying the property since the preceding January, a definitive
sale
price had not been set nor any written sales agreement executed.

 FNB, through Becher, and Howard agreed that if she paid the
escrow
arrears by Aug. 7, 1990, FNB would postpone the scheduled sale
for
two weeks until Aug. 22.  Also, if Howard would then pay one-half
the loan arrears by Aug. 22, FNB would postpone the sale an
additional 30 days, until Sept. 21.

Howard paid the first installment.  The day before the second
installment was due, Mangrum informed FNB that she could not pay
even one-half the next installment and needed another
postponement.
FNB agreed to postpone the trustee's sale if  Howard adhered to a
payment schedule.

Although the prior extensions had not been memorialized in a
writing signed by Howard, Becher at this point insisted that the
revised payment schedule must be written and signed by the
plaintiff.

Contrary to Becher's testimony, Howard testified that, sometime
prior to execution of the written agreement, Becher told her
that,
in return for three payments totaling approximately $14,000, FNB
would "cancel" the foreclosure and await the sale of the property
to Mangrum.

On Nov. 19, 1992, Howard filed her complaint against FNB and
Becher.  The complaint alleged claims for fraud, breach of oral
contract, intentional interference with contract, unfair business
practices and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The pivotal allegation of the complaint was the existence and
breach of the oral agreement to "halt the foreclosure" in return
for partial repayment of the loan balance.

The defendants filed an answer on April 6, 1003, denying all of
the
plaintiff's allegations and raising numerous affirmative
defenses,
including various statutes of limitations.

On June 24, 1994, after conducting discovery, defendants moved
for
summary judgment on numerous grounds, including the contention
that
plaintiff's claims were barred by the parol evidence rule and
applicable statutes of limitation and were substantively without
merit.

The court affirmed the judgment.

FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF
BOSTON PETITIONS 11TH CIR.
FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 30 granted the
First
National Bank of Boston's petition for a writ of mandamus,
instructing the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida to recall the remand and reinstate its case against a
Florida man in a dispute over a consumer loan.  In re First
National Bank of Boston, No. 95-5008 (11th Cir.).

The petition for the writ required the circuit court to decide
whether a district court can remand a case sua sponte within the
30-day period following removal notice provided in 28 U.S.C.
Section  1447(c) for motions to remand.

The district court remanded the case to state court during this
time period.  Because the circuit court concluded that the 1988
amendments to Section 1447(c) precluded the district court from
sua
sponte remand, the court granted the petition.

The origin of the present petition is the related federal case
filed in 1989 by Society for Savings in the U.S. District Court
for
the Southern District of Florida, concerning a consumer loan
secured by a motor yacht extended to Jerome H. Rogers (Society
for
Savings v. M/Y "CONJA", No. 89-6167-CIV-PAINE [SD FL]).

That case was settled by surrender of the vessel to Society for
Savings and the agreed payment of $13,000, representing the
difference in the value of the vessel and the outstanding debt.
Thereafter, various credit reporting agencies showed this loan as
a bad debt.

In 1995, Rogers sued petitioner First National Bank of Boston in
the 15th Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, which he alleged
is the successor to Society for Savings with offices in Palm
Beach
County, FL, and claimed damages exceeding $15,000 for Bank of
Boston's failure to correct credt information relating to Rogers
(Rogers v. Bank of Boston, No. CL 95 347AB [FL Cir. Ct., Palm
Beach
Cty., filed Jan. 17, 1995]).

Subsequently, Rogers filed a settlement demand, requesting
compensatory and punitive damages of $650,000.  Bank of Boston
filed an amended answer and affirmative defenses that denied the
material allegations of the complaint, including the allegation
that Bank of Boston maintained an office in Palm Beach County.

On June 13, 1995, Bank of Boston removed the case to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida pursuant to
28
U.S.C. Section Section 1441 and 1446, and asserted complete
diversity (Rogers v. Bank of Boston, No. 95--8366--CIV--NESBITT
[SD FL, filed June 13, 1995]).

Bank of Boston represented that it is a national banking
association with its principal place of business in
Massachusetts,
making it a Massachusetts citizen, and that the amount in
controversy exceeded $50,000 in compliance with 28 U.S.C. Section
1332(a).

On June 19, 1995, the district court sua sponte remanded the case
to the 11th Judicial Circuit for Dade County.  The district court
determined that Bank of Boston's failure to reveal the state in
which it is incorporated constituted an inadequate showing of its
citizenship for diversity jurisdiction.  The court's order was
filed on June 22, 1995, and the case was closed.

On June 28, 1995, Bank of Boston moved for reconsideration and
vacation of the district court's remand order and for leave to
amend its notice of removal.  The bank explained that, as a
national banking association, it is not incorporated under any
state's law and that its citizenship is determined by its
principal
place of business.

The bank also filed an amended notice of removal, stating this
explanation of its citizenship and clarifying that it maintains
no
branch offices in Florida, although its independent subsidiary
mortgage corporation maintains at least one branch office in
Florida.

On July 21, 1995, the district court entered an order striking
Bank
of Boston's motion for reconsideration and leave to file an
amended
notice of removal because it no longer had jurisdiction over the
case.

The bank then petitioned the court for a writ of mandamus
directing
the district court to recall its remand and to reinstate the case
on its docket.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 21(b), the
circuit
court directed the district judge to respond to Bank of Boston's
argument that the district court's remand was unauthorized under
28
U.S.C. Section 1447(c).

INVESTMENT COMPANY MUST
PAY RENT FROM COMMERCIAL
PROPERTY TO LENDER

In a diversity suit appeal, the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Dec. 12 reversed a decision by the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, ruling that an investment
company must pay Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. rent money on
a commercial property.  Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.
Harris Trust and Savings Bank et al., No. 95-1884 (7th Cir.).

The district court ruled that defendant Kaiser Investments could
refuse to pay on the grounds that a provision in a "Borrower's
Affidavit" requiring the indemnification of rents before the
appointment of a receiver when the trust defaulted was made
unenforceable by the "rents and profits rule."

The case was remanded to the district court for further
proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

In 1986, Fidelity made a $3.6 million loan to an Illinois land
trust that held title to a commercial property.  The trustee was
an
Illinois bank and the beneficiary of the partnership, Kaiser
Investments.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the property, but i
addition,
Kaiser Investments executed a "Borrower's Affidavit" that
contained
a number of warranties and representations designed to induce
Fidelity to make a loan.

One of the paragraphs of the affidavit states that
"notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Loan Papers...Borrower
(Kaiser) shall be and remain personally obligated and liable for,
and shall indemnify Lender against the Property for any period
subsequent to an event of default, and shall pay over the same to
the Lender upon receipt, except to the extent that the same have
been applied in payments of any amounts due Lender under the Note
or other Loan Papers."

The trust defaulted on the loan in February 1993, and in July of
that year, having sent a notice of default the preceding month,
Fidelity brought this suit against the bank and Kaiser
Investments.

The suit asked for foreclosure and other relief, including the
appointment of a receiver and indemnification for any rents
collected after the default.  The district court appointed a
receiver in September 1993, and the receiver began collecting the
rents.  Later, the court decreed foreclosure, and the property
was
sold at a price that left Fidelity with a loss of more than $1.3
million on its loan.

U.S. District Judge James B. Moran held the refusal proper on the
grounds that the provision in the affidavit required
indemnification by the "rents and profits rule."

According to Illinois common law, this rule forbids a mortgagee
to
enforce a provision of a mortgage assigning rents or other income
of the mortgaged property to him until the mortgagee takes
possession of the property.  The judge, therefore, dismissed the
claim and, since other claims in the case had already been
resolved, the dismissal was the final order in the case and was
appealable.

However, Chief Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Posner ruled on
appeal that the indemnity agreement in the Borrower's Affidavit
was
"separate" from the loan papers, and that the borrower, Kaiser,
was
not technically the mortgagor, affects the applicability of the
rents and profits rule.

Judge Posner stated that the rule would be a joke if it could be
avoided by designating certain papers involved in the loan "the
loan papers" and reciting that the assignment of rents was not
among them.  He said it would also be a joke if, as in this case,
that of an Illinois land trust, only the trustee was forbidden to
make an enforceable assignment of rents.

In an Illinois land trust, which is becoming a common mode of
ownership in Illinois and other states, property that is subject
to
a mortgage is "owned" by a trustee whose only function is to hold
title, leaving management and control of the property entirely in
the hands of the beneficiary of the trust.

The agreement between the two parties was that Kaiser was to pay
over the rents to Fidelity upon receipt of the rents by Kaiser.

10TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
CREDITOR CANNOT
EXECUTE UPON MORTGAGES

A ruling that a default judgment creditor is not entitled to
execute upon mortgages in Texas owned by the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) as a matter of law was affirmed Dec.
18
by the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Pipkin v. Mortgage
Creditcorp, Inc. et al., No. 94-6443 (WD OK).

The opinion involves the question of whether a default judgment
creditor may divest the interest of GNMA in certain Texas real
estate mortgages solely because GNMA failed to record its
interest
in the mortgages in adherence to the law.

Plaintiff Roger W. Pipkin III appealed the district court's grant
of summary judgment in favor of GNMA and its mortgage services,
Midland Mortgage, Co., MidFirst Bank and Northwest Bank
(collectvely, the Midland Group).  The district court held that
Texas law was superseded by GNMA's enabling stature and that
Pipkin
was not entitled to execute upon Texas mortgages because GNMA
owned
the mortgages as a matter of law.

Pipkin is the judgment creditor of defendants Mortgage
Creditcorp,
Inc. and Westmark Mortgage Corp. (the Westmark Parties), two
defunct mortgage serving companies.  In 1994, Pipkin obtained a
$4.8 million default judgment against the Westmark Parties in
Texas
state court.  That court then entered the post-judgment order
instructing the Midland Group, the defendants-in-intervention and
third-party plaintiffs, to turn over to Pipkin several Texas real
estate mortgages the court deemed "nonexempt assets of the
Westmark
Parties.

To execute his judgment on the Oklahoma-based Midland Group,
Pipkin
filed the post-judgment order in Oklahoma City.  Subsequently,
the
Midland Group obtained a stay of execution from the state court
and
filed a petition in intervention naming GNMA as third-party
defendant.  GNMA removed the case to the U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma.

GNMA and the Midland Group then moved for summary judgment,
arguing
that the mortgages sought by Pipkin were owned by GNMA, not the
Westmark Parties.  Pipkin countered that, under Texas law, the
Westmark Parties continued to own the mortgages because GNMA
failed
to record its interest in the mortgages.

The district court granted GNMA's and the Midland Group's motions
on the ground that GNMA's enabling statute, 12 U.S.C. Section
1721(g), expressly preempts any Texas law limiting GNMA's
ownership
rights in the mortgages.

Under Section 1721(g), Congress vested GNMA with broad powers to
carry out the congressional objective of establishing and
encouraging a secondary market for home mortgages, the district
court said.

Pipkin contended, however, by virtue of the Texas recording
statute
and GNMA's failure to record its interest in the pooled
mortgages,
the Westmark Parties own those mortgages under Texas law.  As a
judgment creditor of the Westmark Parties, Pipkin argued, he is
entitled to execute on those mortgages.

The circuit court was not persuaded by Pipkin's argument and
affirmed the district court's decision.

DC COURT SUPPORTS BANK'S
MOTION TO STRIKE CLASS
ACTION ALLEGATIONS

In a memorandum filed Dec. 26, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia decided in favor of NationsBank Corp. and
denied class action status to a pending fair lending lawsuit
against the bank.  Lathern et al. v. NationsBank Corp. et al.,
No. 95-CV-1805 (NHJ) (D DC).

The judge had harsh words for the plaintiffs' counsel, the
Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs
(WLC) for failing to timely move for class certification in a
prior
action.

The bank asked the court that the class allegations be stricken
entirely.

This action began Sept. 21, 1995, when plaintiffs filed a
complaint
containing class action allegations under the Fair Housing Act,
the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

However, by failing to move for class certification by Dec. 20,
1995, which was 90 days from the date on which the class
complaint
was filed, the plaintiffs violated Local Rule 203(b).

Accordingly, the court decided, the plaintiffs' class action
allegations should be stricken in their entirety.

John Relman, director of the fair housing project at the WLC,
said
his organization had not missed the deadline, but refused to
elaborate.  He did say WLC's position will be explained in a
future
court filing.

Class action status is important to the WLC's case against the
bank, which alleges that NationsBank discriminated against
borrowers.  At the heart of theissue is money.  If the class
action
is fought in court, NationsBank would have more to lose.  Without
class action status, the case involves 13 plaintiffs and nine
loan
applications, and the awards would be less.  As a class, the WLC
would ask NationsBank to compensate all affected consumers, which
would increase the bank's costs.

In its memorandum, the court stated that WLC had since Dec. 13,
1994, the date of its initial press conference announcing its
campaign to solicit plaintiffs for its class action against the
bank, to construct its legal argument.

To achieve this goal, the WLC used a variety of methods to
attract
plaintiffs, including an "800" hotline number, press statements
and
conferences, and print and radio interviews.

Despite this effort, the court stated that WLC was only able to
attract an additional 11 plaintiffs since the suit was filed
Sept. 21.

The court said that if the plaintiffs feel they have individual
claims, they should litigate them as such.  Also, the court held
that NationsBank should not be subjected to any further
prejudicial
adverse publicity tied to promises of class action litigation.

NationsBank is represented by Robert S. Bennett, Richard L.
Brusca,
Andrew L. Sandler and Heidi L. Mason of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom of Washington, DC.

SECOND CIRCUIT SUPPORTS
RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP
BANKER OUT OF BANKS

The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Jan. 2 that it
supports a prohibition order by an Acting Director (AD) for the
Office of Thrift Supervision against a former bank executive as
proper and a matter of law.  Cousin v. Office of Thrift
Supervision, Nos. 94-4206 and 94,6070 (2nd Cir.).

Also, Michael Cousin's petition for review of the final decision
and order of Jonathan L. Fiechter, AD for the OTS, prohibiting
Cousin from further participating in any manner in the conduct of
the affairs of any banking institution regulated by the OTS.

Since the petition for review of the final decision and order is
denied, the circuit court dismissed as moot the appeal of the
denial of declaratory judgment.

In August 1990, Cousin, then chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of Cross County Federal Savings Bank, was
charged
in federal court with several counts of bribery.  The OTS was
informed of the charges and, two days later, issued a temporary
suspension and prohibition from participation in the affairs of
County Federal.

Cousin then sought to have the criminal indictment against him
dropped in federal court, asserting that he was neither
physically
nor mentally fit to stand trial.

The district court agreed to dismiss the indictment against
Cousin
because he was not physically capable of standing trial; however,
included in the order dismissing the charges against Cousin,
dated
May 25, 1992, was language -- agreed to by Cousin's attorney --
to
the effect that the dismissal of the indictment did not amount to
a dismissal on the merits (Cousin v. Office of Thrift
Supervision,
840 F.Supp. 8,9-10 [ED NY 1993]).

The language was specifically included in the order to ensure
that
the dismissal was not construed as requiring the discontinuation
of
the OTS's temporary suspension and prohibition  against Cousin.

After his physical recovery, Cousin informed the OTS that he was
fit to reenter the banking world.  Despite the explicit language
in
the order dismissing his indictment, Cousin thereafter sought a
declaratory judgment in the district court that his indictment
had
been dismissed on its merits and that, as a matter of law, the
OTS
temporary suspension was required to be lifted.

In light of the language in the order dismissing his indictment,
the district court dismissed Cousin's suit on waiver grounds.
Cousin then appealed the district court's dismissal f his action.

On May 13, 1993, the OTS instituted a proceeding to permanently
prohibit Cousin from further participating in any manner in the
conduct of the affairs of any banking institution regulated by
the
OTS.  In support of the permanent prohibition, Cousin was charged
with bribery and aiding and abetting bribery.

He responded to the OTS claims, asserting a number of affirmative
defenses that focused primarily on entrapment.

A hearing of the claims was held before Administrative Law Judge
Walter J. Alprin in September 1993.  On March 31, 1994, the ALJ
issued his recommendation, disqualifying Cousin from further
participation in the banking
industry.

OTS was represented by Geraldine R. Gennet, Office of the Chief
Counsel, OTS, Washington, DC.  Cousin was represented by Ramsey
Clark, New York City.

10TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS
RETIREMENT FUND'S RIGHT
TO KEEP CONTRIBUTIONS

The 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 28 reversed a
decision by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Oklahoma, ruling that the lower court's decision to award a
multiple-employer pension benefit plan to the plaintiff violated
the exclusive benefit rule of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Financial
Institutions Retirement Fund, No. 95-5016 (10th Cir.).

The issue presented by this case is whether the Resolution Trust
Corp., as successor to a failed thrift institution, can recover
an
actuarial determined sum known as Future Employer Contributions
Offsets (FECO) attributable to the failed thrift as an employer
in
a multiple-employer pension benefit plan under ERISA.

The district court treated the FECO as discrete funds and awarded
them to RTC under a common law unjust enrichment theory.

Financial Institutions Retirement Fund (FIRF) is a
multiple-employer pension benefit plan under ERISA.  The fund is
a
single plan, meaning all of its 360 participating employers pay
into, and all of its approximately 35,000 employees benefit from,
a single fund.

Because of favorable market conditions in 1987, FIRF declared the
plan had reached "full funding," suspended further employer
contributions and advised its overfunded employers, including
Sooner Federal Savings and Loan Association, that the FECO would
be
used to offset the employers' future funding obligations to the
plan.

When Sooner became insolvent in 1989, the RTC, Sooner's receiver,
sold some of its assets to a successor savings association,
excepting any interest in, or claims against, FIRF.   Because of
its liquidation, Sooner was deemed to have withdrawn from FIRF.
At
the time of its insolvency, the value of Sooner's FECO credit was
approximately $4.1 million.

RTC brought the instant action against FIRF in 1989 to obtain
payment of the FECO credits, asserting a common law unjust
enrichment claim.  In response, FIRF claimed it was prohibited by
ERISA from distributing the FECO credits to RTC or to any
employer
for nonpension-related purposes.  Judgment in the amount of $4.6
million was entered in favor of RTC, and this appeal ensued.

On appeal, FIRF contended ERISA's "exclusive benefit" rule
prohibits the use of FECO balances for nonpension purposes.

The 10th Circuit agreed, citing Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S.
753
(1992), which denied the inclusion of pension benefits in a
bankruptcy estate.  The court also agreed with FIRF, citing to
Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365
(1990), which reversed the imposition of a constructive trust on
a
convicted union official's pension benefits.

The circuit court found it evident that the exact amount of the
FECO constantly varies in concert with he values of the
investments comprising the body of the fund.  Yet, the district
court found the FECO are neither hypothetical nor theoretical
because FIRF itself has stated that FECO assets are fund assets.

For this reason, RTC contended, the FECO are tangible assets of
the
fund.  The court ruled that RTC's argument missed the mark.  The
question of whether the FECO credits are needed for the payment
of
benefits can only be determined once the plan as a whole has been
terminated.

Until then, FIRF must anticipate that there could be dramatic
changes on either side, the court held.

The court concluded that RTC's removal of the FECO credits could
potentially destabilize FIRF.  Furthermore, the district court's
decision leads to the prospect of further diminution of the body
of
the plan because other employers may be encouraged to leave the
plan and remove their FECO credits, the court said.

RTC was represented by Thomas C. Morrison of Patterson, Belknap,
Webb & Tyler LLP in New York City.  FIRF was represented by
Richard
B. Noulles of Gables, & Gotwals in Tulsa.
