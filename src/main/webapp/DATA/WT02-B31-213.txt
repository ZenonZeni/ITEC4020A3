	Baz Luhrmann, one of today's most innovative filmmakers, takes a completely fresh and intriguing look at a beloved story with WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET. Luhrmann and his team have created a dazzling, powerful, iconoclastic world full of fantastic elements to underscore and reveal the tale of two famous, star-crossed lovers. The film gives Shakespeare's Elizabethan English a contemporary American voice, set in the mythical city of Verona Beach, a passionate, visceral, sexy, violent other-world, neither future nor past. Luhrmann ("Strictly Ballroom") directed and adapted the play for the screen with Craig Pearce. <P>

	In bringing WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET to the screen, Luhrmann wanted to avoid a rarefied, stilted, elitist, stagy version of the classic play. To do so, Luhrmann cast young, American actors as Romeo, Juliet and the opposing Capulet/Montague gangs, inviting them to speak the famous lines in their own American accent. This was a deliberate choice on Luhrmann's part, in keeping with the Elizabethan articulation of the words.<P>
