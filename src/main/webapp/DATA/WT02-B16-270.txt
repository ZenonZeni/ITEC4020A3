<H2>Case Study: Electricity for a Village Power System</H2>
<p><strong>The System</strong>

<p>The generation system was installed in 1992 with the support of the national
government of Mexico, the local utility, and the village of Xcalak. The state
of Quintana Roo and the national government of Mexico paid for the initial
cost of the project, and the utility updated and expanded the village wiring
system to accommodate increased generating capacity. The villagers pay for
system operation and maintenance. 

<p>Xcalak's hybrid electric system uses PV, wind turbines, and diesel to
generate power. Batteries store electric energy produced by the PV and wind
turbines for use 24 hours a day. An <a href="balance4.html">inverter</a> converts the 
<a href="acdc.html">dc</a> from the
batteries to the ac provided to village residents. The PV arrays generate
electricity during the day, and the wind turbines charge batteries whenever
the wind blows. (The winds are usually best at night.) If the batteries
become drained after a series of cloudy, windless days, or if the demand for
electricity increases, the diesel generators can meet the demand. 

<p>In remote villages the world over, providing reliable electric power can
improve the economy and the quality of life for village residents. For
Xcalak, adding renewable energy generators to their diesel system lowered
operating costs and increased the reliability of electric service. When the
hybrid system went on-line in 1992, it powered 80 homes, four restaurants,
and one 20-room hotel. The village tourism industry centers around the hotel
and restaurants, and its fishing industry benefits from reliable
refrigeration all without being connected to the central utility grid.
