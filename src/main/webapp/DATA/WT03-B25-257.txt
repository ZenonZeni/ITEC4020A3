<BODY>
<H2>2. ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES (continued)<BR>
<HR></H2>
<H3><A NAME="anchor15381423"></A>2.6 Priority Setting</H3>
<H4>2.6.1 EOC Tasks</H4>
The primary activities and cost units, or Tasks, of the EOC will be of three
main types. These are:<BR>
<BR>
1. <B>Working Groups</B> - explorations of issues and EO science problems
by groups from the EOC, contributing Divisions and other contributing groups.
Recommendations are considered relative to support and priorities and may
lead to Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. The results will be
published by the EOC;<BR>
<BR>
2. <B>Science Projects</B> - teams of scientists from the EOC, Divisions
and other groups that come togther to resolve issues, develop algorithms,
devise methods and/or standards. Science Projects are outcome oriented and
collaborative. Output is reported in the scientific literature and is public
domain;<BR>
<BR>
3. <B>Implementation Teams</B> - Working Groups and/or Science Projects
can lead to specific outcomes which may need implementing (eg as software,
manuals, official standards) or technology transfer. Some activities may
be commercial. The products in this case may or may not be public domain
which will be decided as part of the task planning and approval process.<BR>
The EOC Tasks are the basic management unit and make up the science working
area. The Tasks will be managed by a Task Leader and will have a scientific
and financial beginning, middle and end with pre-defined outcomes and measures
of performance. The Task Leader will be responsible to the EOC Science Program
Leader.<BR>
<BR>
The Tasks will be defined generally in terms of three 'dimensions' of: 
<UL>
<LI>the earth surface or atmospheric targets they observe; 
<LI>the platform(s) from which the observations take place; and 
<LI>the sensor system(s) involved. 
</UL>
For example, the characterisation of atmospheric water vapour and aerosols
may relate to satellite data and specifically to data collected by the AVHRR
sensors. On the other hand, the study may take into account a range of platforms
and sensors but be specific to a land surface type. Alternatively, a Task
may relate to generic issue common to wide areas of the task 'space' (such
as sensor specification, surface emissivity or surface reflectance). 
<H4>2.6.2 Applications Oriented Threads</H4>
Most Earth Observation applications demand products that are the result
of a sequence of activities from acquisition, through base processing, interpretation
(often based on modelling) and finally to product presentation. These sequences
will be referred to as 'Threads'. The generic EOC Tasks can be seen as components
of applications oriented Threads which map across Focus areas and retain
a consistent set of 'dimensions' in terms of Target, Platform and Sensor
as well as overall objective in the final products and results. Threads
are the road maps between raw data acquisition and sector oriented products.<BR>
<BR>
End users are interested in products and behind each product is the technology
the EOC serves. The combination and interaction of components in this technology
is the Thread. Threads will be the primary areas of concern out of which
EOC Tasks are defined and EOC products valued. Any one EOC Task can and
usually will also involve a number of Threads that pass through it from
different data sources and on to different types of end product. Thread
Coordination is an important activity and is between clients (who generally
relate closely to the output end of Threads) and the EOC management.<BR>
<BR>
For example, a Thread may involve the production of NDVI or land surface
temperature products for crop monitoring from AVHRR (Land Targets, NOAA
platform, AVHRR sensor). Many of the tasks along such a Thread will be generic
and can be considered along with activities relating to MODIS, AATSR, GMS,
and even AVHRR to provide Sea Surface Temperatures or a number of other
products. The NDVI product can be a component of global change as well as
vegetation monitoring but the EOC will define, develop and extend its Tasks
as those which are generic and common to many applications oriented Threads.
In many cases, some or most of the Tasks can be done by the end user or
client. The job is to uncover the generic Tasks where a Focus of action
will maximise the benefits over many Threads and to the benefit of many
outcomes. 
<H4>2.6.3 Working Groups as entry points</H4>
The Working Group is the essential initial step in developing generic Tasks
from the applications oriented Threads and is the entry point for all approved
Tasks. The results of the Working Groups form the basis for priority setting.
Working Groups identify and help rank issues and (following prioritisation)
lead to the selected focus activities of the EOC. As outlined above, these
are Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. Science Projects resolve
the scientific issues and publish results. Implementation Teams may take
the results from the Science Project and implement then (for example) as
software or develop a technology transfer strategy. The outcomes of the
science teams will be formal scientific publications but those of the implementation
teams may not be. For example, Implementation Teams may involve commercial
software houses working with scientists to provide products that are documented,
quality controlled and work correctly.<BR>
<BR>
The Working Groups offer an opportunity for scientists in different Divisions,
the EOC and from other groups to develop collaboration and locate major
centres of expertise and interest. The projects selected will seek the best
teams and be subject to approval in competition with other Working Group
outcomes. The priority setting and approval process for the Science Projects
and Implementation Teams that arise from this activity will be explicit
and include specific identification of deliverables and milestones.<BR>
<BR>
The EOC has a central location in Canberra where a critical mass of scientists
will tackle generic science issues and algorithm development. However, locations
of EOC project and implementation activities can also be decided by infrastructure
and core staff locations and be potentially at any location with adequate
research support among CSIRO sites. The key characteristics of EOC projects
are collocation of scientists, efficient use of resources, inter-Divisional
collaboration, support for the goals of the EOC and a generic Earth Observation
Science focus that provides support across different applications and/or
involves a range of tools.<BR>
<BR>
As stated above, the proposals for Science Projects and/or Implementation
Teams that arise from an initial Working Group and/or the issues raised
by an applications oriented Thread are the input to the EOC priority setting
activity. Projects should be outcome oriented and will be evaluated for
their closeness to the objectives of the EOC, their financial viability
and contribution to the collaborative model (including collocation of staff)
on which the EOC is being built. The Science Review Panel and the COSSA
Steering Committee will be involved in priority setting with the COSSA Steering
Committee helping to provide overall directions and the Science Review Panel
providing and monitoring scientific and client goals and input.<BR>
<BR>
Science Projects and Implementation Teams will be formed according to specific
guide-lines and will be monitored for progress within the EOC structure
discussed below and evaluated against criteria defined at the outset of
the activity. The outcomes of an EOC Task will emphasise quality of product
and excellence of production. A primary role of and criterion for EOC activities
includes making the findings accessible and useful to areas of CSIRO and
industry not currently exploiting Earth Observation to its fullest extent.
<H3><A NAME="anchor15383831"></A>2.7 Scientific Development</H3>
The key area of EOC activity relates to the longer term development of and
promotion of excellence in the Earth Observation research base in Australia
which is fundamental to Australia 'taking charge' of this area and owning
its innovation. This can be helped considerably by developing the Earth
Observation Industry with consequent creation of demand for graduates and
a flow of investment funding into the education system.<BR>
<BR>
The EOC will also encourage the professional development of scientists in
CSIRO and other groups by providing an environment for visits, study leave,
participation in projects and for the direct involvement of CSIRO staff
with post graduate students at associated Universities as joint supervisors
and assessors. The EOC will provide significant support aimed at encouraging
students to undertake subjects involving advanced Earth Observation techniques
and environmental physics.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists from CSIRO Divisions, Agencies and industry will be able to take
advantage of the pooled knowledge in the EOC by short to medium term involvement
in EOC projects. A fundamental aim of the EOC is to educate and enrich the
CSIRO staff who are closely involved at the working interface with clients
as well as providing a career development path in fundamental contributions
to Earth Observation Science of a type that is difficult at the client interface.<BR>
