<CENTER><H3>Why Use the <I>Lagniappe Letter</I> and the <I>Lagniappe
Quarterly Monitor</I></H3></CENTER>
<P>Doing business in Latin America involves a high degree of uncertainty, and
this puts constant pressure on you to keep track of fast-changing events.  You
can try to read the avalanche of information that pours on to your desk every
day or you can stay focused and save your time by subscribing to the one
publication that keeps you quickly and efficiently informed of relevant
developments.  This is the <I>Lagniappe Letter &amp; Lagniappe Quarterly
Monitor.</I></P>
<P>The 10-page biweekly <I>Lagniappe Letter</I> systematically provides the
hard news and analysis relevant to business concerns in the region's major
markets - Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico,
Panama, Peru, and Venezuela plus Central America and the Caribbean as events
warrant.  Its companion <I>Lagniappe Quarterly Monitor</I> provides a data base
of key financial indicators for each major country, plus short-term forecasts of
financial and production trends.</P>
<P>This double package of biweekly newsletters plus a quarterly data base and
forecasting tool provides you with a correct balance of elements for efficiently
undertaking consistent qualitative and quantitative analysis of each major
market.</P>
<P><I>Lagniappe</I> has been independently produced by its staff of US and
Latin American-based analysts since 1984.  There is no other independent
publication in the market of <I>Lagniappe's</I> scope, reliability and level of
sophistication - at any price.<BR></P>
