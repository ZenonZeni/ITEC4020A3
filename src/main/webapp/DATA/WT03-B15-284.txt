<H2>What do professionals say about the Super Power Tour?</H2>
<STRONG>
We gratefully acknowledge the valuable guidance received from the Association for the Care of Children's Health, the Child Life Council, and a number of Child Life and Recreational Therapists in shaping the Super Power Tour lessons.  <BR>
<P>If you haven’t yet experienced the magic of meeting an EP robot, please take a few moments to read what the professionals below have to say.  Their personal observations of this program in action will make descriptions of the Super Power Tour much more meaningful for you.<BR>
<P>These letters and many more are on file at GoWell & Kent, Inc.<BR></STRONG>

<P><LI>The children and staff were absolutely thrilled by your robot.  Your robot’s extraordinary ability to personalize his interactions with each individual made it that much more special. Visits like yours truly help turn what can often be a scary and foreign environment into one that allows for laughter.<BR>

<P><LI><EM>What a wonderful program you have!  The children and their families were very excited to meet your robot.  His warm, caring personality has endeared him to many hearts.  There were several poignant moments.  Robbie, a seventeen year old oncology patient in the end stage of his disease got up, out of bed (That hasn’t happened in days!).  He also spoke with your robot which really astounded his caretakers, who haven’t heard his voice in a long time.  Hannah, a newly diagnosed three year old oncology patient smiled for the first time since admission.  Her parents were very touched.  This wonderful message certainly made a difference in the lives of our patients.</EM><BR>
