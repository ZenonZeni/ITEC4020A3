<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VIII -- SARAWAK<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p>NEAR British North Borneo. Area, 42,000 square miles, many
rivers navigable. The government of part of the present territory
was obtained in 1842 by Sir James Brooke from the Sultan of
Brunei. Various accessions were made between 1861, 1885, and
188o. The Rajah, H. H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G. C.M.G.,
nephew to the late Rajah, born June 3, 1829, succeeded in 1868.
Population estimated at 500,000, Malays, Dyaks, Kayans, Kenyahs,
and Muruts, with Chinese and other settlers. </p>

<p>Thus the Statesman's Year Book, to which we would add a
paragraph from an article in the National Geographic Magazine for
February, 1919. Under the title: &quot;Sarawak: The Land of the
White Rajahs&quot; we read: &quot;With the recent death of Sir
Charles Brooke, G. C. M. G., the second of the white rajahs of
Sarawak, there came to an end one of the most useful and unusual
careers among the many that have done credit to British rule in
the Far East. For nearly 49 years he governed, as absolute
sovereign, a mixed population of Chinese, Malays, and numerous
pagan tribes scattered through the villages and dense jungles of
an extensive territory on the northwest coast of Borneo. </p>

<p>&quot; Constant solicitude for the welfare of his people won
the sympathy and devotion which enabled this white man, supported
by an insignificant army and police, to establish the peaceful
occupations of civilization in place of barbarous tyranny and
oppression.&quot; </p>

<p>How thoroughly this &quot;civilizing&quot; process was
accomplished may be judged somewhat by turning to the Colonial
Office List for 19I7, where on page 436 we read: &quot;Sarawak:
The principal sources of revenue are the opium, gambling, pawn
shops, and arrack, producing: </p>

<p>1908 $483,019 </p>

<p>1909 460,416 </p>

<p>1910 385,070 </p>

<p>1911 420,151 </p>

<p>1912 426,867 </p>

<p>1913 492,455 </p>

<p>In the Statesman's Year Book for 1916 we find the total
revenue for this well-governed little colony as follows, given
however in pounds sterling, instead of dollars, as in the above
table. Thus: </p>

<p>Revenue-1910 221,284 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911I 159,456 </p>

<p>1912 175,967 </p>

<p>1913 210,342 </p>

<p>1914 208,823 </p>

<p>It would seem as if forty-nine years of constant solicitude
for the welfare of a people, establishing the peaceful
occupations of civilization, might have resulted in something
better than a revenue derived from opium, gambling, pawn shops
and arrack. </p>
