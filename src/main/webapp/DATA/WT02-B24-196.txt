of Candidates</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center's many carefully screened egg donors are finding themselves
in an unusual situation. They are having to wait for recipient couples. In
the past, the circumstances were reversed; infertile couples were forced
to wait long periods for egg donors.
<P>Many egg donor programs rely on the random donation of left over eggs.
This results in a one to two year wait for a donor. At this writing, the
Center has a surplus of waiting donors.
<P>The Center's success in attracting qualified egg donors is best explained
by an egg donor whose recipient mother recently gave birth to twins. "It
feels great to help someone finally have a family without having to go through
the pregnancy and birth myself. This is truly the GIFT' OF LIFE."

<P>
<P>As if the pain and grief of infertility weren't enough, most people struggling
with childlessness are also saddled with massive medical bills. In response,
RESOLVE has been working on passing mandated infertility medical coverage.
So far, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, Arkansas, California
and Hawaii have passed legislation covering in vitro fertilization (IVF)
and/or other infertility procedures.
<P>The very concreteness of these actions is bringing more men into the
organization. While RESOLVE has always been an organization for both men
and women, women, in our culture seem to be more disposed to ask for and
accept help. Doing something, taking action - this seems to be a masculine
way of coping. Indeed, all of us may feel that affecting change is a method
of gaining some control over one's life.
<P>What's more, one gets not only information at those late night advocacy
meetings; the sharing of similar experiences provides emotional support for
the people who work together for a common goal.
<P>While RESOLVE's purpose was to advocate for expanded insurance coverage
for infertility-related procedures, we found that participation in this effort
often helped to meet the emotional needs as well as ease the financial burden
of the infertile community.
<P>RESOLVE is a national organization for over 20,000 people with 53 chapters
in forty states. Their mission is to support, educate and advocate about
fertility issues and to assist the infertile person and/or couple to find
a unique solution to the painful dilemma of infertility. For further information,
write to RESOLVE, 5 Water Street, Arlington, MA 02174-4814, or call at (617)
643-2424.

</H3><H4><CENTER>New Mom Writes to Her Surrogate Mother</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Dear Julia,
<P>By now, you know me pretty well. And you know that I can write on just
about any subject. But I feel as though there are no words to express what
you have done for me and Gregory. Jamie is a miracle if ever there was one.
He is the baby of my heart. The one I've always wanted and imagined. But,
he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
<P>One year ago, I couldn't even look at a pregnant woman without feeling
pain. I couldn't look into the window of a nursery furniture store or a baby
clothiers store without wondering what I could have done to deserve such
punishment.
<P>Every time there was a story about an infant abandoned or abused, I wanted
to take that child and make it my own. I couldn't understand why someone
who had been so blessed could abuse that privilege.
<P>Now, after eight years of waiting, I am actually somebody's mommy. You
can't imagine what it feels like to write those words. Every little thing
Jamie does is so precious to me.
<P>You gave what so few have the power to give. Not just an egg and a uterus.
The care and concern for others to make being a surrogate mother worthwhile.
How many people have the ability to make someone else's dream come true?
That's just what you've been able to do. And you've done it with such openness,
such selflessness, such pride. I hope that Jamie will inherit a little of
that from you.
<P>Julia, I hope that you realize that with your strength, and your positive
attitude, you can do anything you set your mind to. I hope this experience
has proven that to you.
<P>Soon, you will start a new life in Idaho. I know that you and Ken will
make it a fantastic success. I see your children, Alex and Seth, growing
up in an atmosphere of wonderful values and plenty of love. They can't help
but be successes, too.
<P>I know, too, that we will not continue to be as close as we've been. And
that's probably only natural. But understand that I will be thinking of you.
Jamie will know who you are as soon as he is old enough to understand. And
he will be taught to love and respect you. Of course we'll keep in touch
and keep you informed of his progress. And I hope you will let me know what
is new and exciting in your life, too.
<P>It's obvious how many people in your life think you are terrific and special.
But, with the exception of Ken and the boys, no one will really know the
full extent of what you have done the way Gregory and I do.
<P>I don't know if I could feel any closer to you. Not if we were sisters.
You've changed my life for the better and in the process I can see the positive
things you've done for yourself.
<P>No matter what else happens in the rest of your life, you have already
done more to prove you are a caring person than most people will ever be
able to do. And I have the baby to prove it.
<P>I love you, Julia. And, I always will.

</H3><H4><CENTER>Birth Power: The Case for Surrogacy<BR>by Carmel Shalev.
201 pp. New Haven Yale University Press, 1989.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Carmel Shalev, an attorney educated at Yale University and living in Tel
Aviv, writes, "just as men have the right to be compensated for their sperm,
so should women have the right to be compensated for their reproductive services
and become surrogate mothers." This is the thesis of Ms. Shalev's "Birth
Power," which explores the social and legal issues raised by combining impersonal
reproductive technologies with increasingly varied challenges to the traditional
family. Looking ahead, she maintains that surrogacy contracts should be legal
and binding. She contends that legalizing surrogacy would empower, not enslave
women. This is a provocative and insightful book, raising fundamental questions
which Ms. Shalev cannot always answer.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=endo>The Endometriosis Association</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>An Important Resource</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Endometriosis Association is a non-profit organization that, for the
past ten years, has been dedicated to providing information and assistance
to those suffering from the disease, as well as to researchers and doctors
studying its relationship to infertility.
<P>Endometriosis is a disease of women in their reproductive years in which
tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found growing outside of the
uterus. Endometriosis affects 5-1/2 million women in North America, causing
infertility in 30-40% of the cases. It often causes pain and scarring, resulting
in blocked tubes and adhesions. But researchers now believe that there may
be inflammatory and immunological changes that occur as well which may cause
infertility in endometriosis patients.
<P>The Endometriosis Association provides support services on a group, individual
and crisis basis, an education program through their newsletters, videotapes,
and written information, and a research program which includes the largest
endometriosis registry in the world. For further information, call
1-800-992-3636, or write to the Endometriosis Association, 8585 North 76th
Place, Milwaukee, WI 53223.

</H3><H4><CENTER>After the Birth<BR>by <A HREF=Hillbio.html>Dr. Hilary Hanafin,
Ph.D.</A><BR>Psychologist, Center for Surrogate Parenting</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<H4>Q. What feelings do surrogate mothers experience after the birth?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>Feelings after the birth are unique for each woman and
are reflective of their individual experience. On the positive side, the
most commonly reported feelings include relief from the physical drain of
pregnancy and the emotional strain of preparing for the birth and separation.
Surrogates also report a feeling of relief to recover their own lives and
get on with the business of living. Other postpartum feelings include a sense
of pride for having made a childless couple's dream come true, and accomplishment
in having achieved such a challenging goal. A good surrogate program should
leave a surrogate feeling fulfilled, resolved and satisfied. She should feel
that she has personally benefited from the experience. In follow-up studies,
surrogate mothers report a greater appreciation of their family, an enrichment
of their lives, and an increase in self confidence.
<P>Of course, every surrogate experience has some negative postpartum feelings
as well. The two pervasive ones are: the loss of the pregnancy itself (which
for some surrogates may be their last), and the other is the loss of the
infertile couple. After the birth, the open, warm and caring relationship
undergoes a change, and the loss of the attention and specialness is keenly
felt. After the birth, negative feelings can also be triggered if a surrogate
has some painful, unresolved history.
<P>The surrogates reported a range of feelings about their birthchildren.
Very often, their attachment is reportedly greater to the couple than to
the baby. Commonly, her perception is that the child is "their child", both
morally and existentially; the child would not have come into being if it
were not for this particular couple's love and desire. Surrogates describe
feelings of love, care, interest and joy toward the child, but report that
their feelings are different from those they experienced with their own children.
A curiosity about the child remains and a sense of caring and moral obligation
usually continues. However, typically surrogates have reported an absence
of long-term grieving over the loss of the child.
<P>A primary variable in the surrogate's feelings is the infertile couple's
treatment of her during the pregnancy, the hospital birth and directly
afterwards. A woman's grief is greatly intensified if she feels abandoned,
rejected or used by the parents. Her separation is greatly eased and facilitated
if she feels respected, trusted and appreciated. The new parents' behavior
can have a tremendous influence on their surrogate mother's long-term feelings
about herself and her participation.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=family>In a Family Way</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>Increasingly, family members are helping each other to solve the painful
dilemma of childlessness. The Center has assisted many couples with the legal
and psychological issues which may arise when working with a family member.
The Center reports involvement in a wide variety of situations: a sister
being a surrogate via artificial insemination for her sister, a sister-in-law
carrying the embryo of her brother and his wife, and a twin sister donating
eggs.
<P>Third-party reproduction within a family presents a unique psychological
situation in which professional counseling is essential; one cannot simply
walk away from family if problems arise - it is a lifetime involvement. Some
of the psychological issues to consider are who, what, when and how to tell
extended family members. It is also important for them to understand their
own family history together prior to conception and how the birth of the
intended child may affect their future relationship.
<P>Legal issues must be addressed as well, including resolution of the legal
status of the child. In the case of egg or sperm donor, the woman giving
birth from a donated egg is the legal mother, as is the husband in the case
of sperm donor. In the case of surrogacy via artificial insemination, a
step-parent adoption must be completed in which the wife adopts her husband's
child. In the case of IVF/Host surrogacy (in which the embryo is produced
by the infertile couple), an attorney may petition the courts to enter the
genetic parents names on the birth certificate, thereby eliminating the need
for a step-parent adoption. Other legal issues needing attention might include
the drafting of a contract or agreement to meet the needs and expectations
of all parties.

on where to seek assistance as well as provide guidance to families considering

<H4>Birth of Egg Donor Twins
</H4><P>The Center congratulates both recipient and donor in the birth this
March of twin girls. Working in conjunction with our Center, Dr. Paulo Serafini
of Huntington Memorial Hospital Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California,
helped perform this medical miracle. The donor, who lives in Southern California,
was previously a surrogate mother in the Center's Surrogate Program. When
asked about her experience, she laughed, "it was the easiest way I ever helped
bring twins into the world." Her couple called her from the hospital after
the birth to share their joy. She noted that they were planning to implant
the two frozen embryos (remaining from the initial egg retrieval) sometime
early in 1991.
<P>
<H4>New Reproductive Center
</H4><P>Dr. Ricardo Asch, Director of the Center for Reproductive Health
in Orange, California, will be completing his new facility this summer. It
will include a full, in-office operating suite to facilitate egg retrieval
and implantation. Dr. Asch has been an integral part of the Center's Egg
Donor Program, and has assisted many of our clients.
<P>
<H4>International Surrogacy
</H4><P>The Center reports working with many international clients. So far,
our surrogate mothers are helping to create families for couples living in
Italy, England, France, Denmark, Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, New Guinea,
Hong Kong, Argentina, Venezuela, Singapore, Guatemala, Nigeria and Taiwan.
<P>
<H4>Center Adds Nurse to Staff
</H4><P>We are pleased to introduce Amy Grant Rivera, R.N., who has just
joined our team. Amy is a registered nurse with 10 years experience. She
graduated with a B.S.N. from The Catholic University of America in 1980.
She has most recently worked at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los
Angeles, delivering IVF babies conceived with the help of Dr. Richard Marrs.
Amy will act as medical liaison with our infertile couples, surrogate mothers
and physicians.
<P>
<H4>Worlds First Frozen Embryo Birth via Surrogacy
</H4><P>Beginning life as an embryo frozen in the blastocyst stage, a baby
girl was born this March to a gestational surrogate mother in the Center's
program. Dr. Richard Marrs, of the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los
Angeles, performed the initial egg retrieval, which did not produce a pregnancy
when used in a fresh transfer, but did succeed in the subsequent frozen attempt.
Mother and surrogate mother are still amazed and doing well after a routine
delivery.
<P>
<H4>Operator Assistance
</H4><P>Since we do not advertise for clients, a routine question asked of
our prospective parents is "how did you hear about The Center?" Many reply
that we are on RESOLVE's referral list, or that various gynecologists, IVF
clinics, or university teaching hospitals refer them - but our favorite was
the couple who found us by calling the wrong number. Upon discovering we
were not the credit department of Sears, they proceeded to ask who in fact
we were. And the rest is history, including their family's newest member,
little Lillianne.
