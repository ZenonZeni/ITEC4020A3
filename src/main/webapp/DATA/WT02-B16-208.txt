<h2>Amorphous Silicon</h2>

<p><font size=+2>A</font>morphous solids, like common glass, are materials in which the atoms are not arranged in any
particular order.  They do not form crystalline structures at all, and they contain large numbers of
structural and bonding defects. 

<p>It wasn't until 1974 that researchers began to realize that amorphous silicon could be used in PV
devices by properly controlling the conditions under which it was deposited and by carefully
modifying its composition.  Today, amorphous silicon is commonly used for solar-powered
consumer devices that have low power requirements (e.g., wrist watches and calculators).

<p>Amorphous silicon absorbs solar radiation 40 times more efficiently than does single-crystal
silicon, so a film only about 1 micron (one one-millionth of a meter) thick can absorb 90% of the
usable solar energy.  This is one of the most important factors affecting its potential for low cost. 
Other principal economic advantages are that amorphous silicon can be produced at a lower
temperature and can be deposited on low-cost substrates.  These characteristics make amorphous
silicon the leading thin-film PV material.

more conventional PV modules.</font>
