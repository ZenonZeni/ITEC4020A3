Officers Elected at Global Climate Coalition

William O'Keefe, executive vice president of the American Petroleum
Institute, was recently elected chairman of the Global Climate
Coalition (GCC). O'Keefe will lead the GCC's efforts throughout 1996 
to provide business and industry positions to scientific and policy 
debates regarding climate change.

Working closely with executive director John Shales, O'Keefe will
direct GCC's nine committees, while Shales manages the daily
business and advocates on behalf of the Coalition.

Other newly elected officers include vice chair for policy Robert
McFadden from American Automobile Manufacturers Association, chair
of the operating committee Constance Holmes from the National Mining 
Association, vice chair of the operating committee Robert Beck from 
Edison Electric Institute and vice chair for the membership Edward 
Harper from the Association of American Railroads.

For details contact Jane Agate at 202/628-3622.

Wind Power Plant Construction Expands in Midwest

In Minnesota, Northern Alternative Energy, Inc. of Minneapolis and
Micon Wind Turbines (U.S.) of Marshall are gearing up to expand the
Sibley, IA wind plant owned by IES Utilities, Inc.  When completed, 
the project will be the single largest turbine installation in the 
nation's midsection.

The first U.S.-made 600-kW Micon M1500-600/150 turbine will be
installed by Micon and NAE in Sibley, expanding the facility's
capacity to 925 kW from 325 kW.

The annual energy output of the plant is anticipated to top 1.8
million kWh after installation of the new turbine.  NAE president
Greg Jaunich said that this largest single turbine in the Midwest 
"should demonstrate to utilities in the region the benefits of 
large, industrial-sized wind turbines for electrical generation."

The nacelle and frame of the turbine were constructed by Micon and
Hutchinson Manufacturing Inc., which also assembled the generator
and its components.  Micon turbines are a Danish design.  The 
turbine, atop its 150-foot tubular tower, will be made by Thomas & 
Betts of Red Wing, MI.

European Commission Beefs Up Research Budget

Mme. Edith Cresson, European Commissioner for Research, Education 
and Training recently proposed 318 research and development projects
that have been approved by the EC as the European Community's 
participatory offering following the Fourth Framework Convention 
meeting on climate change.

Addressed will be ozone depletion, global warming, floods,
earthquakes, contaminated land and sustainable development.  The
Environment and Climate program will fund the research.

The Environment and Climate program has a budget of ECU 532 million,
which represents 4.3 percent of total Fourth Framework Program
funding covering 1994-1998.  Research to understand basic mechanisms 
of climate and other natural systems and how they impact natural 
resources will be performed.

Technologies will also be developed to monitor, protect and
rehabilitate as well as to conduct risk assessment.  Satellite
systems for earth observation and environmental research play a 
large part in the research.

Past climatic changes and dynamics will receive increased attention
to help understand current weather patterns.  The EPICA projects
will complement three successful Greenland ice cap projects by 
studying ice cores in Antarctica that will allow scientists to 
interpret earlier climate shifts over a half-million years.

Aerosols originating from dust, sea-spray, soot and suspended sulfur
dioxide are known to be important in the earth's energy balance.
Surrounded by cloud particles, they absorb radiation and also 
reflect it back into space.  Program ACE-2 will address the role of 
clouds and aerosols in the climate system and will also continue to 
look at processes of both natural and manmade aerosols.

Finns Push Coal at Expense of Nuclear Power

A radical overhaul of fuel taxation being undertaken by the Finnish
government could see a rise in construction of coal-fired power
plants at the expense of existing nuclear power.  Finland has agreed 
that it will not expand nuclear power generation nor build more 
nuclear-based power stations, a strategy that appears to argue for 
expanded coal-fired energy production.

The Finnish move will bring Finnish taxation more into line with
neighbors Sweden, Norway and Denmark which tax consumption, not
production, as has been the case in Finland.  The tax burden on 
coal- fired production will be reduced by an amount to be determined 
when the legislature meets this month.

Premier Paavo Lipponen told the legislature in December that the new
energy policy took into consideration the unpopularity of
nuclear-based production as well as the need for ways to improve 
coal- fired generation's cost-efficiency.

Lipponen had run for election based on promises of higher taxes on
coal and peat-fired plants, but the about-face, explains Antti
Kalliomaki, Finland's Trade and Industry minister, is because 
Swedish companies would like to export power into Finland because 
Finnish energy production costs have remained so much higher.
