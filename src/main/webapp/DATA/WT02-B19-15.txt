<h1>Chemical Engineering Foundation</h1>
The Chemical Engineering Foundation within the University of Sydney was
established in 1981 with the following objectives:
<ul> 
<li>to foster good communications between industry and commerce and the
Department of Chemical Engineering,
<li>to advise on courses of instruction in Chemical Engineering,
<li>to encourage students of high calibre to work in the Department,
<li>to assist graduates in Chemical Engineering to make appropriate
contributions to industry,
<li>to facilitate and develop research in Chemical Engineering with
particular reference to industry oriented projects.
</ul>
The Chemical Engineering Foundation provides an opportunity for
executives in Australian industry to participate in the development of
the Chemical Engineering profession. As at July 1991, 24 companies are
members.
<P>
Activities have included financial support to the undergraduate
program and research by both postgraduates and staff. Intensive
courses have been coordinated, publication of updates on the
Department's research activities is undertaken regularly, and emphasis
is placed on expanding industry-university collaboration.
