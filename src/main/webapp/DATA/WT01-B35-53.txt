<h3>7. Radiance from Ernst Jünger </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Radiance</i> is the perfect term to express the
influence that Ernst Jünger's literary work and personality have
had on me. In the light of his perspective, which
stereoscopically comprises the surfaces and depths of things, the
world I knew took on a new, translucent splendor. That happened a
long time before the discovery of LSD and before I came into
personal contact with this author in connection with
hallucinogenic drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My enchantment with Ernst Jünger began with his
book <i>Das Abenteuerliche Herz </i>[The adventurous heart].
Again and again in the last forty years I have taken up this
book. Here more than ever, in themes that weigh more lightly and
lie closer to me than war and a new type of human being (subjects
of Jünger's earlier books), the beauty and magic of Jünger's
prose was opened to me-descriptions of flowers, of dreams, of
solitary walks; thoughts about chance, the future, colors, and
about other themes that have direct relation to our personal
lives. Everywhere in his prose the miracle of creation became
evident, in the precise description of the surfaces and, in
translucence, of the depths; and the uniqueness and the
imperishable in every human being was touched upon. No other
writer has thus opened my eyes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drugs were also mentioned in <i>Das</i> <i>Abenteuerliche
Herz. </i>Many years passed, however, before I myself began to be
especially interested in this subject, after the discovery of the
psychic effects of LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My first correspondence with Ernst Jünger had
nothing to do with the context of drugs; rather I once wrote to
him on his birthday, as a thankful reader. </p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bottmingen, 29 March 1947 <br>
    Dear Mr. Jünger, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; As one richly endowed by you for years, I
    wished to send a jar of honey to you for your birthday. But I
    did not have this pleasure, because my export license has
    been refused in Bern. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The gift was intended less as a greeting from a
    country in which milk and honey still flow, than as a
    reminiscence of the enchanting sentences in your book <i>Auf
    den Marmorklippen </i>(On the Marble Cliffs), where you speak
    of the &quot;golden bees.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The book mentioned here had appeared in 1939,
just shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Auf den
Marmorklippen is not only a masterpiece of German prose, but also
a work of great significance because in this book the
characteristics of tyrants and the horror of war and nocturnal
bombardment are described prophetically, in poetic vision. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of our correspondence, Ernst Jünger
also inquired about my LSD studies, of which he had learned
through a friend. Thereupon I sent him the pertinent
publications, which he acknowledged with the following comments: </p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Kirchhorst, 3/3/1948 <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; . . . together with both enclosures concerning
    your new phantasticum. It seems indeed that you have entered
    a field that contains so many tempting mysteries. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Your consignment came together with the <i>Confessions
    of an English Opium Eater, </i>that has just been published
    in a new translation. The translator writes me that his
    reading of <i>Das Abenteuerliche Herz </i>stimulated him to
    do his work. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as I am concerned, my practical studies
    in this field are far behind me. These are experiments in
    which one sooner or later embarks on truly dangerous paths,
    and may be considered lucky to escape with only a black eye. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; What interested me above all was the
    relationship of these substances to productivity. It has been
    my experience, however, that creative achievement requires an
    alert consciousness, and that it diminishes under the spell
    of drugs. On the other hand, conceptualization is important,
    and one gains insights under the influence of drugs that
    indeed are not possible otherwise. I consider the beautiful
    essay that Maupassant has written about ether to be such an
    insight. Moreover, I had the impression that in fever one
    also discovers new landscapes, new archipelagos, and a new
    music, that becomes completely distinct when the
    &quot;customs station&quot; [&quot;An der Zollstation&quot;
    [At the custom station], the title heading of a section in <i>Das
    Abenteuerliche Herz </i>(2d ed.) that concerns the transition
    from life to death.] appears. For geographic description, on
    the other hand, one must be fully conscious. What
    productivity means to the artist, healing means to the
    physician. Accordingly, it also may suffice for him that he
    sometimes enters the regions through the tapestries that our
    senses have woven. Moreover, I seem to perceive in our time
    less of a taste for the phantastica than for the
    energetica&#151;amphetamine, which has even been furnished to
    fliers and other soldiers by the armies, belongs to this
    group. Tea is in my opinion a phantasticum, coffee an
    energeticum&#151;tea therefore possesses a disproportionately
    higher artistic rank. I notice that coffee disrupts the
    delicate lattice of light and shadows, the fruitful doubts
    that emerge during the writing of a sentence. One exceeds his
    inhibitions. With tea, on the other hand, the thoughts climb
    genuinely upward. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; So far as my &quot;studies&quot; are concerned,
    I had a manuscript on that topic, but have since burned it.
    My excursions terminated with hashish, that led to very
    pleasant, but also to manic states, to oriental tyranny....</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon afterward, in a letter from Ernst Jünger I
learned that he had inserted a discourse about drugs in the novel
<i>Heliopolis</i>, on which he was then working. He wrote to me
about the drug researcher who figures in the novel: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Among the trips in the geographical and metaphysical
    worlds, which I am attempting to describe there, are those of
    a purely sedentary man, who explores the archipelagos beyond
    the navigable seas, for which he uses drugs as a vehicle. I
    give extracts from his log book. Certainly, I cannot allow
    this Columbus of the inner globe to end well-he dies of a
    poisoning. <i>Avis au lecteur.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The book that appeared the following year bore the
subtitle <i>Ruckblick auf eine Stadt</i> [Retrospective on a
city], a retrospective on a city of the future, in which
technical apparatus and the weapons of the present time were
developed still further in magic, and in which power struggles
between a demonic technocracy and a conservative force took
place. In the figure of Antonio Peri, Jünger depicted the
mentioned drug researcher, who resided in the ancient city of <i>Heliopolis</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>He captured dreams, just like others appear to chase after
    butterflies with nets. He did not travel to the islands on
    Sundays and holidays and did not frequent the taverns on
    Pagos beach. He locked himself up in his studio for trips
    into the dreamy regions. He said that all countries and
    unknown islands were woven into the tapestry. The drugs
    served him as keys to entry into the chambers and caves of
    this world. In the course of the years he had gained great
    knowledge, and he kept a log book of his excursions. A small
    library adjoined this studio, consisting partly of herbals
    and medicinal reports, partly of works by poets and
    magicians. Antonio tended to read there while the effect of
    the drug itself developed. . . . He went on voyages of
    discovery in the universe of his brain.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the center of this library, which was pillaged
by mercenaries of the provincial governor during the arrest of
Antonio Peri, stood </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The great inspirers of the nineteenth century: De Quincey,
    E.T.A. Hoffmann, Poe, and Baudelaire. Yet there were also
    books from the ancient past: herbals, necromancy texts, and
    demonology of the middle-aged world. They included the names
    Albertus Magnus, Raimundus Lullus, and Agrippa of
    Nettesheym.... Moreover, there was the great folio <i>De
    Praestigiis Daemonum</i> by Wierus, and the very unique
    compilations of Medicus Weckerus, published in Basel in
    1582.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In another part of his collection, Antonio Peri
seemed to have cast his attention principally &quot;on ancient
pharmacology books, formularies and pharmacopoeias, and to have
hunted for reprints of journals and annals. Among others was
found a heavy old volume by the Heidelberg psychologists on the
extract of mescal buttons, and a paper on the phantastica of
ergot by Hofmann-Bottmingen....&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same year in which <i>Heliopolis</i> came
out, I made the personal acquaintance of the author. I went to
meet Ernst Jünger in Ravensburg, for a Swiss sojourn. On a
wonderful fall journey in southern Switzerland, together with
mutual friends, I experienced the radiant power of his
personality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two years later, at the beginning of February 1951,
came the great adventure, an LSD trip with Ernst Jünger. Since,
up until that moment, there were only reports of LSD experiments
in connection with psychiatric inquiries, this experiment
especially interested me, because this was an opportunity to
observe the effects of LSD on the artistic person, in a
nonmedical milieu. That was still somewhat before Aldous Huxley,
from the same perspective, began to experiment with mescaline,
about which he then reported in his two books <i>The Doors of
Perception</i> and <i>Heaven and Hell.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to have medical aid on hand if necessary,
I invited my friend, the physician and pharmacologist Professor
Heribert Konzett, to participate. The trip took place at 10:00 in
the morning, in the living room of our house in Bottmingen. Since
the reaction of such a highly sensitive man as Ernst Jünger was
not foreseeable, a low dose was chosen for this first experiment
as a precaution, only 0.05 mg. The experiment then, did not lead
into great depths. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The beginning phase was characterized by the
intensification of aesthetic experience. Red-violet roses were of
unknown luminosity and radiated in portentous brightness. The
concerto for flute and harp by Mozart was perceived in its
celestial beauty as heavenly music. In mutual astonishment we
contemplated the haze of smoke that ascended with the ease of
thought from a Japanese incense stick. As the inebriation became
deeper and the conversation ended, we came to fantastic reveries
while we lay in our easy chairs with closed eyes. Ernst Jünger
enjoyed the color display of oriental images: I was on a trip
among Berber tribes in North Africa, saw colored caravans and
lush oases. Heribert Konzett, whose features seemed to me to be
transfigured, Buddha-like, experienced a breath of timelessness,
liberation from the past and the future, blessedness through
being completely here and now. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The return from the altered state of consciousness
was associated with strong sensitivity to cold. Like freezing
travelers, we enveloped ourselves in covers for the landing. The
return to everyday reality was celebrated with a good dinner, in
which Burgundy flowed copiously. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This trip was characterized by the mutuality and
parallelism of our experiences, which were perceived as
profoundly joyful. All three of us had drawn near the gate to an
experience of mystical being; however, it did not open. The dose
we had chosen was too low. In misunderstanding this reason, Ernst
Jünger, who had earlier been thrust into deeper realms by a high
dose of mescaline, remarked: &quot;Compared with the tiger
mescaline, your LSD, is, after all, only a house cat.&quot; After
later experiments with higher doses of LSD, he revised this
estimation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jünger has assimilated the mentioned spectacle of
the incense stick into literature, in his story <i>Besuch auf
Gotenhotm </i>[Visit to Godenholm], in which deeper experiences
of drug inebriation also play a part: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Schwarzenberg burned an incense stick, as he sometimes
    did, to clear the air. A blue plume ascended from the tip of
    the stick. Moltner looked at it first with astonishment, then
    with delight, as if a new power of the eyes had come to him.
    It revealed itself in the play of this fragrant smoke, which
    ascended from the slender stick and then branched out into a
    delicate crown. It was as if his imagination had created it-a
    pallid web of sea lilies in the depths, that scarcely
    trembled from the beat of the surf. Time was active in this
    creation-it had circled it, whirled about it, wreathed it, as
    if imaginary coins rapidly piled up one on top of another.
    The abundance of space revealed itself in the fiber work, the
    nerves, which stretched and unfolded in the height, in a vast
    number of filaments. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now a breath of air affected the vision, and
    softly twisted it about the shaft like a dancer. Moltner
    uttered a shout of surprise. The beams and lattices of the
    wondrous flower wheeled around in new planes, in new fields.
    Myriads of molecules observed the harmony. Here the laws no
    longer acted under the veil of appearance; matter was so
    delicate and weightless that it clearly reflected them. How
    simple and cogent everything was. The numbers, masses and
    weights stood out from matter. They cast off the raiments. No
    goddess could inform the initiates more boldly and freely.
    The pyramids with their weight did not reach up to this
    revelation. That was Pythagorean luster. No spectacle had
    ever affected him with such a magic spell. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This deepened experience in the aesthetic sphere,
as it is described here in the example of contemplation of a haze
of blue smoke, is typical of the beginning phase of LSD
inebriation, before deeper alterations of conscious begin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I visited Ernst Jünger occasionally in the
following years, in Wilfingen, Germany, where he had moved from
Ravensburg; or we met in Switzerland, at my place in Bottmingen,
or in Bundnerland in southeastern Switzerland. Through the shared
LSD experience our relations had deepened. Drugs and problems
connected with them constituted a major subject of our
conversation and correspondence, without our having made further
practical experiments in the meantime. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We exchanged literature about drugs. Ernst Jünger
thus let me have for my drug library the rare, valuable monograph
of Dr. Ernst Freiherrn von Bibra, <i>Die Narkotischen
Genussmittel und der Mensch </i>[Narcotic pleasure drugs and man]
printed in Nuremburg in 1855. This book is a pioneering, standard
work of drug literature, a source of the first order, above all
as relates to the history of drugs. What von Bibra embraces under
the designation &quot;Narkotischen Genussmittel&quot; are not
only substances like opium and thorn apple, but also coffee,
tobacco, kat, which do not fall under the present conception of
narcotics, any more than do drugs such as coca, fly agaric, and
hashish, which he also described. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Noteworthy, and today still as topical as at the
time, are the general opinions about drugs that von Bibra
contrived more than a century ago: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The individual who has taken too much hashish, and then
    runs frantically about in the streets and attacks everyone
    who confronts him, sinks into insignificance beside the
    numbers of those who after mealtime pass calm and happy hours
    with a moderate dose; and the number of those who are able to
    overcome the heaviest exertions through coca, yes, who were
    possibly rescued from death by starvation through coca, by
    far exceed the few <i>coqueros</i> who have undermined their
    health by immoderate use. In the same manner, only a
    misplaced hypocrisy can condemn the vinous cup of old father
    Noah, because individual drunkards do not know how to observe
    limit and moderation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From time to time I advised Ernst Jünger about
actual and entertaining events in the field of inebriating drugs,
as in my letter of September 1955: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . Last week the first 200 grams of a new drug arrived,
    whose investigation I wish to take up. It involves the seeds
    of a mimosa (<i>Piptadenia peregrina </i>Benth,) that is used
    as a stimulating intoxicant by the Indians of the Orinoco.
    The seeds are ground, fermented, and then mixed with the
    powder of burned snail shells. This powder is sniffed by the
    Indians with the help of a hollow, forked bird bone, as
    already reported by Alexander von Humboldt in <i>Reise nach
    den Aequinoctiat-Gegenden des Neuen Kontinents </i>[Voyage to
    the equinoctial regions of the new continent] (Book 8,
    Chapter 24). The warlike tribe, the Otomaco, especially use
    this drug, called <i>niopo, yupa, nopo</i> or <i>cojoba</i>,
    to an extensive degree, even today. It is reported in the
    monograph by P. J. Gumilla, S. J. <i>(El Orinoco Ilustrado, </i>1741):
    &quot;The Otomacos sniffed the powder before they went to
    battle with the Caribes, for in earlier times there existed
    savage wars between these tribes.... This drug robs them
    completely of reason, and they frantically seize their
    weapons. And if the women were not so adept at holding them
    back and binding them fast, they would daily cause horrible
    devastation. It is a terrible vice.... Other benign and
    docile tribes that also sniff the <i>yupa</i>, do not get
    into such a fury as the Otomacos, who through self-injury
    with this agent made themselves completely cruel before
    combat, and marched into battle with savage fury.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I am curious how <i>niopo</i> would act on
    people like us. Should a <i>niopo</i> session one day come to
    pass, then we should on no account send our wives away, as on
    that early spring reverie [The LSD trip of February 1951 is
    meant here.], that they may bind us fast if necessary.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chemical analysis of this drug led to isolation of
active principles that, like the ergot alkaloids and psilocybin,
belong to the group of indole alkaloids, but which were already
described in the technical literature, and were therefore not
investigated further in the Sandoz laboratories. [Translator's
note: The active principles of <i>niopo</i> are DMT
(N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and its congeners. DMT was first
prepared in 1931 by Manske.] The fantastic effects described
above appeared to occur only with the particular manner of use as
snuff powder, and also seemed to be related, in all probability,
to the psychic structure of the Indian tribes concerned.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Ambivalence of Drug Use </h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fundamental questions of drug problems were dealt
with in the following correspondence. <br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bottmingen, 16 December 1961 <br>
    Dear Mr. Jünger, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the one hand, I would have the great desire,
    besides the natural-scientific, chemical-pharmacological
    investigation of hallucinogenic substances, also to research
    their use as magic drugs in other regions.... On the other
    hand, I must admit that the fundamental question very much
    occupies me, whether the use of these types of drugs, namely
    of substances that so deeply affect our minds, could not
    indeed represent a forbidden transgression of limits. As long
    as any means or methods are used, which provide only an
    additional, newer aspect of reality, surely there is nothing
    to object to in such means; on the contrary, the experience
    and the knowledge of further facets of <i>the </i>reality
    only makes this reality ever more real to us. The question
    exists, however, whether the deeply affecting drugs under
    discussion here will in fact only open an additional window
    for our senses and perceptions, or whether the spectator
    himself, the core of his being, undergoes alterations. The
    latter would signify that something is altered that in my
    opinion should always remain intact. My concern is addressed
    to the question, whether the innermost core of our being is
    actually unimpeachable, and cannot become damaged by whatever
    happens in its material, physical-chemical, biological and
    psychic shells-or whether matter in the form of these drugs
    displays a potency that has the ability to attack the
    spiritual center of the personality, the self. The latter
    would have to be explained by the fact that the effect of
    magic drugs happens at the borderline where mind and matter
    merge-that these magic substances are themselves cracks in
    the infinite realm of matter, in which the depth of matter,
    its relationship with the mind, becomes particularly obvious.
    This could be expressed by a modification of the familiar
    words of Goethe: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Were the eye not sunny, <br>
        It could never behold the sun; <br>
        If the power of the mind were not in matter, <br>
        How could matter disturb the mind.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This would correspond to cracks which the
    radioactive substances constitute in the periodic system of
    the elements, where the transition of matter into energy
    becomes manifest. Indeed, one must ask whether the production
    of atomic energy likewise represents a transgression of
    forbidden limits. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A further disquieting thought, which follows
    from the possibility of influencing the highest intellectual
    functions by traces of a substance, concerns free will. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The highly active psychotropic substances like
    LSD and psilocybin possess in their chemical structure a very
    close relationship with substances inherent in the body,
    which are found in the central nervous system and play an
    important role in the regulation of its functions. It is
    therefore conceivable that through some disturbance in the
    metabolism of the normal neurotransmitters, a compound like
    LSD or psilocybin is formed, which can determine and alter
    the character of the individual, his world view and his
    behavior. A trace of a substance, whose production or
    nonproduction we cannot control with our wills, has the power
    to shape our destiny. Such biochemical considerations could
    have led to the sentence that Gottfried Benn quoted in his
    essay &quot;Provoziertes Leben&quot; [Provoked life]:
    &quot;God is a substance, a drug!&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, it is well known that
    substances like adrenaline, for example, are formed or set
    free in our organism by thoughts and emotions, which for
    their part determine the functions of the nervous system. One
    may therefore suppose that our material organism is
    susceptible to and shaped by our mind, in the same way that
    our intellectual essence is shaped by our biochemistry. Which
    came first can indeed no better be determined than the
    question, whether the chicken came before the egg. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of my uncertainty with regard to the
    fundamental dangers that could lie in the use of
    hallucinogenic substances, I have continued investigations on
    the active principles of the Mexican magic morning glories,
    of which I wrote you briefly once before. In the seeds of
    this morning glory, that were called <i>ololiuhqui </i>by the
    ancient Aztecs, we found as active principles lysergic acid
    derivatives chemically very closely related to LSD. That was
    an almost unbelievable finding. I have all along had a
    particular love for the morning glories. They were the first
    flowers that I grew myself in my little child's garden. Their
    blue and red cups belong to the first memories of my
    childhood. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I recently read in a book by D. T. Suzuki, <i>Zen
    and Japanese Culture,</i> that the morning glory plays a
    great role in Japan, among the flower lovers, in literature,
    and in graphic arts. Its fleeting splendor has given the
    Japanese imagination rich stimulus. Among others, Suzuki
    quotes a three- line poem of the poetess Chiyo (1702-75), who
    one morning went to fetch water from a neighbor's house,
    because . . . </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;My trough is captivated <br>
        by a morning glory blossom, <br>
        So I ask after water.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The morning glory thus shows both possible ways
    of influencing the mind-body-essence of man: in Mexico it
    exerts its effects in a chemical way as a magic drug, while
    in Japan it acts from the spiritual side, through the beauty
    of its flower cups. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Wilflingen, 17 December 1961<br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann,<br>
    I give you my thanks for your detailed letter of 16 December.
    I have reflected on your central question, and may probably
    become occupied with it on the occasion of the revision of <i>An
    der Zeitmauer</i> [At the wall of time]. There I intimated
    that, in the field of physics as well as in the field of
    biology, we are beginning to develop procedures that are no
    longer to be understood as advances in the established sense,
    but that rather intervene in evolution and lead forth in the
    development of the species. Certainly I turn the glove inside
    out, for I suppose that it is a new world age, which begins
    to act evolutionarily on the prototypes. Our science with its
    theories and discoveries is therefore not the cause, rather
    one of the consequences of evolution, among others. Animals,
    plants, the atmosphere and the surfaces of planets will be
    concerned simultaneously. We do not progress from point to
    point, rather we cross over a line. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The risk that you indicated is well to be
    considered. However, it exists in every aspect of our
    existence. The common denominator appears now here, now
    there. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In mentioning radioactivity, you use the word <i>crack.</i>
    Cracks are not merely points of discovery, but also points of
    destruction. Compared to the effects of radiation, those of
    the magical drugs are more genuine and much less rough. In
    classical manner they lead us beyond the humane. Gurdjieff
    has already seen that to some extent. Wine has already
    changed much, has brought new gods and a new humanity with
    it. But wine is to the new substances as classical physics is
    to modern physics. These things should only be tried in small
    circles. I cannot agree with the thoughts of Huxley, that
    possibilities for transcendence could here be given to the
    masses. Indeed, this does not involve comforting fictions,
    but rather realities, if we take the matter earnestly. And
    few contacts will suffice here for the setting of courses and
    guidance. It also transcends theology and belongs in the
    chapter of theogony, as it necessarily entails entry into a
    new house, in the astrological sense. At first, one can be
    satisfied with this insight, and should above all be cautious
    with the designations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Heartfelt thanks also for the beautiful picture
    of the blue morning glory. It appears to be the same that I
    cultivate year after year in my garden. I did not know that
    it possesses specific powers; however, that is probably the
    case with every plant. We do not know the key to most.
    Besides this, there must be a central viewpoint from which
    not only the chemistry, the structure, the color, but rather
    all attributes become significant....</p>

<h4>An Experiment with Psilocybin </h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such theoretical discussions about the magic drugs
were supplemented by practical experiments. One such experiment,
which served as a comparison between LSD and psilocybin, took
place in the spring of 1962. The proper occasion for it presented
itself at the home of the Jüngers, in the former head forester's
house of Stauffenberg's Castle in Wilflingen. My friends, the
pharmacologist Professor Heribert Konzett and the Islamic scholar
Dr. Rudolf Gelpke, also took part in this mushroom symposium. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The old chronicles described how the Aztecs drank <i>chocolatl</i>
before they ate <i>teonanácatl</i>. Thus Mrs. Liselotte Jünger
likewise served us hot chocolate, to set the mood. Then she
abandoned the four men to their fate. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had gathered in a fashionable living room, with
a dark wooden ceiling, white tile stove, period furniture, old
French engravings on the walls, a gorgeous bouquet of tulips on
the table. Ernst Jünger wore a long, broad, dark blue striped
kaftan-like garment that he had brought from Egypt; Heribert
Konzett was resplendent in a brightly embroidered mandarin gown;
Rudolf Gelpke and I had put on housecoats. The everyday reality
should be laid aside, along with everyday clothing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly before sundown we took the drug, not the
mushrooms, but rather their active principle, 20 mg psilocybin
each. That corresponded to some two-thirds of the very strong
dose that was taken by the curandera Maria Sabina in the form of
Psilocybe mushrooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After an hour I still noticed no effect, while my
companions were already very deeply into the trip. I had come
with the hope that in the mushroom inebriation I could manage to
allow certain images from euphoric moments of my childhood, which
remained in my memory as blissful experiences, to come alive: a
meadow covered with chrysanthemums lightly stirred by the early
summer wind; the rosebush in the evening light after a rain
storm; the blue irises hanging over the vineyard wall. Instead of
these bright images from my childhood home, strange scenery
emerged, when the mushroom factor finally began to act. Half
stupefied, I sank deeper, passed through totally deserted cities
with a Mexican type of exotic, yet dead splendor. Terrified, I
tried to detain myself on the surface, to concentrate alertly on
the outer world, on the surroundings. For a time I succeeded. I
then observed Ernst Jünger, colossal in the room, pacing back
and forth, a powerful, mighty magician. Heribert Konzett in the
silky lustrous housecoat seemed to be a dangerous, Chinese clown.
Even Rudolf Gelpke appeared sinister to me; long, thin,
mysterious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the increasing depth of inebriation,
everything became yet stranger. I even felt strange to myself.
Weird, cold, foolish, deserted, in a dull light, were the places
I traversed when I closed my eyes. Emptied of all meaning, the
environment also seemed ghostlike to me whenever I opened my eyes
and tried to cling to the outer world. The total emptiness
threatened to drag me down into absolute nothingness. I remember
how I seized Rudolf Gelpke's arm as he passed by my chair, and
held myself to him, in order not to sink into dark nothingness.
Fear of death seized me, and illimitable longing to return to the
living creation, to the reality of the world of men. After
timeless fear I slowly returned to the room . I saw and heard the
great magician lecturing uninterruptedly with a clear, loud
voice, about Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel, and speaking about the
old Gäa, the beloved little mother. Heribert Konzett and Rudolf
Gelpke were already completely on the earth again, while I could
only regain my footing with great effort. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me this entry into the mushroom world had been
a test, a confrontation with a dead world and with the void. The
experiment had developed differently from what I had expected.
Nevertheless, the encounter with the void can also be appraised
as a gain. Then the existence of the creation appears so much
more wondrous. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Midnight had passed, as we sat together at the
table that the mistress of the house had set in the upper story.
We celebrated the return with an exquisite repast and with
Mozart's music. The conversation, during which we exchanged our
experiences, lasted almost until morning. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ernst Jünger has described how he had experienced
this trip, in his book Annähenngen&#151;Drogen und Rausch
[Approaches-drugs and inebriation] (published by Ernst Klett
Verlag, Stuttgart, 1970), in the section &quot;Ein
Pilz-Symposium&quot; [A mushroom symposium]. The following is an
extract from the work: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As usual, a half hour or a little more passed in silence.
    Then came the first signs: the flowers on the table began to
    flare up and sent out flashes. It was time for leaving work;
    outside the streets were being cleaned, like on every
    weekend. The brush strokes invaded the silence painfully.
    This shuffling and brushing, now and again also a scraping,
    pounding, rumbling, and hammering, has random causes and is
    also symptomatic, like one of the signs that announces an
    illness. Again and again it also plays a role in the history
    of magic practices. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; By this time the mushroom began to act; the
    spring bouquet glowed darker. That was no natural light. The
    shadows stirred in the corners, as if they sought form. I
    became uneasy, even chilled, despite the heat that emanated
    from the tiles. I stretched myself on the sofa, drew the
    covers over my head. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Everything became skin and was touched, even
    the retina-there the contact was light. This light was
    multicolored; it arranged itself in strings, which gently
    swung back and forth; in strings of glass beads of oriental
    doorways. They formed doors, like those one passes through in
    a dream, curtains of lust and danger. The wind stirred them
    like a garment. They also fell down from the belts of
    dancers, opened and closed themselves with the swing of the
    hips, and from the beads a rippling of the most delicate
    sounds fluttered to the heightened senses. The chime of the
    silver rings on the ankles and wrists is already too loud. It
    smells of sweat, blood, tobacco, chopped horse hairs, cheap
    rose essence. Who knows what is going on in the stables? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It must be an immense palace, Mauritanian, not
    a good place. At this ballroom flights of adjoining rooms
    lead into the lower stratum. And everywhere the curtains with
    their glitter, their sparkling, radioactive glow. Moreover,
    the rippling of glassy instruments with their beckoning,
    their wooing solicitation: &quot; Will you go with me,
    beautiful boy?&quot; Now it ceased, now it repeated, more
    importunate, more intrusive, almost already assured of
    agreement. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now came forms-historical collages, the <i>vox
    humana,</i> the call of the cuckoo. Was it the whore of Santa
    Lucia, who stuck her breasts out of the window? Then the play
    was ruined. Salome danced; the amber necklace emitted sparks
    and made the nipples erect. What would one not do for one's
    Johannes? [Translator's note: &quot;Johannes&quot; here is
    slang for penis, as in English &quot;Dick&quot; or
    &quot;Peter.&quot;] -damned, that was a disgusting obscenity,
    which did not come from me, but was whispered through the
    curtain. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The snakes were dirty, scarcely alive, they
    wallowed sluggishly over the floor mats. They were garnished
    with brilliant shards. Others looked up from the floor with
    red and green eyes. It glistened and whispered, hissed and
    sparkled like diminutive sickles at the sacred harvest. Then
    it quieted, and came anew, more faintly, more forward. They
    had me in their hand. &quot;There we immediately understood
    ourselves.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Madam came through the curtain: she was busy,
    passed by me without noticing me. I saw the boots with the
    red heels. Garters constricted the thick thighs in the
    middle, the flesh bulged out there. The enormous breasts, the
    dark delta of the Amazon, parrots, piranhas, semiprecious
    stones everywhere. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now she went into the kitchen-or are there
    still cellars here? The sparkling and whispering, the hissing
    and twinkling could no longer be differentiated; it seemed to
    become concentrated, now proudly rejoicing, full of hope. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It became hot and intolerable; I threw the
    covers off. The room was faintly illuminated; the
    pharmacologist stood at the window in the white mandarin
    frock, which had served me shortly before in Rottweil at the
    carnival. The orientalist sat beside the tile stove; he
    moaned as if he had a nightmare. I understood; it had been a
    first round, and it would soon start again. The time was not
    yet up. I had already seen the beloved little mother under
    other circumstances. But even excrement is earth, belongs
    like gold to transformed matter. One must come to terms with
    it, without getting too close. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; These were the earthy mushrooms. More light was
    hidden in the dark grain that burst from the ear, more yet in
    the green juice of the succulents on the glowing slopes of
    Mexico. . . . [Translator's note: Jünger is referring to
    LSD, a derivative of ergot, and mescaline, derived from the
    Mexican peyotl cactus.] <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The trip had run awry&#151;possibly I should
    address the mushrooms once more. Yet indeed the whispering
    returned, the flashing and sparkling&#151;the bait pulled the
    fish close behind itself. Once the motif is given, then it
    engraves itself, like on a roller each new beginning, each
    new revolution repeats the melody. The game did not get
    beyond this kind of dreariness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know how often this was repeated, and
    prefer not to dwell upon it. Also, there are things which one
    would rather keep to oneself. In any case, midnight was
    past.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We went upstairs; the table was set. The senses
    were still heightened and the Doors of Perception were
    opened. The light undulated from the red wine in the carafe;
    a froth surged at the brim. We listened to a flute concerto.
    It had not turned out better for the others: How beautiful,
    to be back among men.&quot; Thus Albert Hofmann. </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The orientalist on the other hand had been in
Samarkand, where Timur rests in a coffin of nephrite. He had
followed the victorious march through cities, whose dowry on
entry was a cauldron filled with eyes. There he had long stood
before one of the skull pyramids that terrible Timur had erected,
and in the multitude of severed heads had perceived even his own.
It was encrusted with stones. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A light dawned on the pharmacologist when he heard this:
    Now I know why you were sitting in the armchair without your
    head-I was astonished; I knew I wasn't dreaming. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder whether I should not strike out this
    detail since it borders on the area of ghost stories. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mushroom substance had carried all four of us
off, not into luminous heights, rather into deeper regions. It
seems that the psilocybin inebriation is more darkly colored in
the majority of cases than the inebriation produced by LSD. The
influence of these two active substances is sure to differ from
one individual to another. Personally, for me, there was more
light in the LSD experiments than in the experiments with the
earthy mushroom, just as Ernst Jünger remarks in the preceding
report.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Another LSD Session </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The next and last thrust into the inner universe
together with Ernst Jünger, this time again using LSD, led us
very far from everyday consciousness. We came close to the
ultimate door. Of course this door, according to Ernst Jünger,
will in fact only open for us in the great transition from life
into the hereafter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This last joint experiment occurred in February
1970, again at the head forester's house in Wilflingen. In this
case there were only the two of us. Ernst Jünger took 0.15 mg
LSD, I took 0.10 mg. Ernst Jünger has published without
commentary the log book, the notes he made during the experiment,
in <i>Approaches,</i> in the section &quot;Nochmals LSD&quot;
[LSD once again]. They are scanty and tell the reader little,
just like my own records. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The experiment lasted from morning just after
breakfast until darkness fell. At the beginning of the trip, we
again listened to the concerto for flute and harp by Mozart,
which always made me especially happy, but this time, strange to
say, seemed to me like the turning of porcelain figures. Then the
intoxication led quickly into wordless depths. When I wanted to
describe the perplexing alterations of consciousness to Ernst
Jünger, no more than two or three words came out, for they
sounded so false, so unable to express the experience; they
seemed to originate from an infinitely distant world that had
become strange; I abandoned the attempt, laughing hopelessly.
Obviously, Ernst Jünger had the same experience, yet we did not
need speech; a glance sufficed for the deepest understanding. I
could, however, put some scraps of sentences on paper, such as at
the beginning: &quot;Our boat tosses violently.&quot; Later, upon
regarding expensively bound books in the library: &quot;Like
red-gold pushed from within to without-exuding golden
luster.&quot; Outside it began to snow. Masked children marched
past and carts with carnival revelers passed by in the streets.
With a glance through the window into the garden, in which snow
patches lay, many-colored masks appeared over the high walls
bordering it, embedded in an infinitely joyful shade of blue:
&quot;A Breughel garden&#151;I live <i>with </i>and <i>in</i> the
objects.&quot; Later: &quot;At present&#151;no connection with
the everyday world.&quot; Toward the end, deep, comforting
insight expressed: &quot;Hitherto confirmed on my path.&quot;
This time LSD had led to a blessed approach. </p>
