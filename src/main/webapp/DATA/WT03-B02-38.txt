TAX REFORM COULD BLAST BALANCE SHEETS

Tax simplification could have a drastic effect on corporate balance
sheets, wiping out as much as $3 trillion in equity, according to tax
experts at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants who have
just completed a major study of alternatives to the current system.
        Many observers in Washington and on Wall Street believe that
Congress will undertake a major overhaul of the tax system by the turn of
the century. But the new AICPA study indicates that the "unintended
consequences" of some of the tax reform plans that have been put forth are
so great that the proposals will collapse of their own weight.
        "The level of discussion in the last two or three years (about tax
reform) has gotten to be significant, but once you look at some of this
information you become less certain that people will want to jump into
that," said Deborah Walker, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner and chair of the
AICPA's Tax Executive Committee.
        "The AICPA has long been an advocate of tax simplification, but
there are many, many unanswered questions," said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA
president.
        Various proposals have been made in Washington, and they differ in
many significant ways. But in general they would do away with the current
income-based system of taxation and replace it with one based on
consumption.
        Byrle M. Abbin, a retired partner and now a consultant at Arthur
Andersen, warned of "dire" effects on financial statements from tax
simplification. First, there would be some gains from the elimination of
the corporate income tax. He noted that $600 billion in deferred tax
liabilities would no longer be owed while just $100 billion in deferred tax
assets would be wiped out by a flat tax.
        But the big crunch would become with the imposition of a
consumption tax.
        "Without transition relief, deductions for depreciation of existing
assets would not be allowed under the new tax, and the entire proceeds from
a theoretical sale of assets at the end of the reporting year for the
initial application of the new tax law would be included in the tax base,"
the AICPA said in its new study, "Flat Taxes and Consumption Taxes: A Guide
to the Debate."
        Assuming a 10% tax rate and given that corporations have $20
trillion in tax basis, "it is possible that $2 trillion of deferred tax
liabilities would be created upon the enactment of this new tax," the AICPA
said.
        Under FAS 109, this entire amount, which could be higher with a
higher tax rate, would have to be booked in the year of tax change.
        "This would more than wipe out total corporate profits in any one
year and severely reduce the amount of shareholders' equity," the AICPA
warned. "Thus financial statements would have to reflect the enormous
increase in future taxes that results from lost depreciation deductions or
taxable gain on sales due to the elimination of tax basis."
        "The desire for efficiency and simplification has to be balanced
with problems of fairness," Abbin said. He acknowledged that some of these
problems could be reduced or resolved with appropriate transition rules.
But he predicted a battle royal over those rules.
        "Even if you do have transition rules, first you are going to have
strong discussions involving FASB, the SEC, the accounting profession and
Congress," he said. "It would be a tough, tough confrontation."
        Tax simplification could present additional problems for insurers.
Not the least of these would be the loss of tax advantaged status for many
life products and for policy payouts. In addition, however, insurance
companies and other financial service providers may find themselves subject
to a special tax regime.
        "Because it is difficult to identify and value services provided by
financial institutions, no country with a consumption tax has been able to
tax financial services in a manner consistent with consumption tax
principles," the AICPA said. "Exemption of financial institutions from
consumption tax generally results in overtaxation of financial services
provided to businesses and undertaxation of services provided to
consumers."
        In general the tax burden would increase for labor-intensive
businesses, such as insurers, and decrease for capital-intensive ones, the
AICPA said. While tax rates may be cut dramatically, tax outlays could
actually increase.
        "Even though the (proposed) rates sound low, you have to remember
that people don't pay rates, they pay taxes," Abbin said. "There'll be a
whole host of companies with lower rates that will have higher taxes to pay
because major components of their business cannot be deducted."
        Another area where there could be surprising consequences to tax
reform is in international operations. "The exclusion of exports from gross
receipts provides large tax benefits to those firms that export," the AICPA
said.
        In addition, Abbin said that the "U.S. could become a tax haven"
under some of the reform proposals. "This could bring retaliation from
foreign countries where we have operations." --Miles Maguire

FAIR VALUE OF LIABILITIES STILL A CHALLENGE

It can be done, but it won't be easy.
        That's the clear message about setting fair values of insurance
liabilities that came out of last month's conference on the subject at New
York University.
        The two key challenges are that there is no active market for
insurance liabilities and that such liabilities typically contain embedded
options, which are best estimated through complex valuation methodologies.
        On the other hand, there is a general consensus that the current
lopsided approach to marking only one side of the balance sheet to market
is creating distortions in financial statements.
        "One can conclude that the current GAAP accounting environment is
subject to ambiguity and inconsistency with regard to the underlying
economics of transactions, can result in significant volatility of earnings
and/or surplus, is losing the goals of company comparability and
comparability over time, is not capturing all the risk exposures of the
company and so is not reflecting what has really transpired and the impacts
of a company's management actions on the firm," said David N. Becker,vice
president, chief actuarial officer and appointed actuary at Lincoln
National Life Insurance Co.
        He presented a paper at the conference describing a methodology
called the "option adjusted value of distributable earnings" (OAVDE), which
can be used to find the fair value of liabilities after determining the
present value of future earnings under various scenarios.
        "Applying finance and option pricing theory directly to liabilities
is a powerful and useful, but it is not a completely valid analogy for
insurance enterprises," Becker said.
        "While market value analysis  does provide insight as to the risk
posture, it does not provide all the insight into the risk/reward posture
of the value of the firm that OAVDE analysis does," he added. "This is due
to the omission from the market value analysis of significant economic
variables and their timing that affects the value of the insurance
enterprise."
        A similar point was made by Christopher D. O'Brien, appointed
actuary of Royal Life Insurance in Liverpool, England. "We usually consider
the 'main' liabilities under a life assurance policy as being the monetary
amounts contractually payable to policyholders in specified circumstances,"
he said. "However, life assurance is a long-term contract under which there
is also a continuing obligation of the company to provide future
'services.'" These include advising, administration and investment, he
said. He also proposed a method calling for consideration of future
revenues discounted to present value.
        Dennis L. Carr, executive vice president and chief product
development officer at ARM Financial Group Inc., provide a real-life
experience of developing fair value liabilities for an insurance company.
In 1994, he said, the company had negative equity under FAS 115 and was
facing questions from rating agencies, distributors and others.
        Using a draft paper from the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA),
input from the firm's outside auditors and its internal asset/liability
management models, ARM came up with a way to show fair value of
liabilities, which used a mixture of marking to market and making value
estimations. Using this approach, the $14 million in negative GAAP equity
at the end of 1994 became $115 million in positive equity.
        "Fair value was implemented, and the results have been reasonable,"
Carr said. "Questions remain, but they are easier to answer."
        Also at the conference the AAA distributed its white paper on fair
values of liabilities. This describes two general approaches to the matter,
a constructive one that focuses on valuing liabilities and a deductive one
that first sets the overall value of the firm, such as in OAVDE.
        "While both methods are theoretically defensible and appealing,
they can produce different answers and do not yield identical answers
except in the simplest, most contrived hypothetical case," the paper says.
        It adds that the constructive approach is "more consistent with
asset valuation and reflective of valuations in the thin secondary GIC
market" while the deductive approach may be more appropriate "in the thin
company or block acquisition market."

SURPLUS NOTES BACKED IN NEW REPORT

Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. says in a new report that surplus
notes spreads should narrow as investors come to understand them and their
similarity to the debt issued by insurance holding companies.
        "Understanding the similarity of 'double leverage' is important in
understanding the risk of surplus notes compared to traditional debt
instruments," the rating agency said. "Like their mutual counterparts that
have issued surplus notes in the 144a market, many stock insurers also
record equity capital on their statutory balance sheets that has been
financed in public debt markets."
        Because the market for surplus notes issued by healthy companies is
relatively young, many investors do not understand the true risk profile of
the instruments, DCR said. "Because of this, market spreads on surplus
notes appear higher than necessary," it said.
        The rating agency expects the market to grow as new risk based
capital rules are extended to the P/C sector. It also sees greater use of
the instrument by stock companies.
        "Stock insurers who have issued surplus notes have traditionally
done so privately to their holding companies for various tax reasons,
though DCR expects stock insurer issuance in the 144a market to begin
shortly," the rating agency said.
        In its view, surplus notes are very similar to holding company debt
in terms of subordination. "In a holding company structure, the insurance
company subsidiary's most junior obligation, common equity, is actually the
funding source for the holding company's senior debt," DCR said. "This
makes holding company senior debt a highly subordinated obligation from the
perspective of the organization as a whole."
        The rating agency argues that investors should evaluate surplus
notes on a company-specific basis, "by looking at both the credit rating on
the note and the claims paying ability of the issuer." DCR considers
surplus notes in much the same way it looks at debt-financed equity capital
in a holding company structure.
        "If DCR believes the positive effect on earnings, operating
leverage and RBC outweighs the future effect of debt service, the addition
of debt financed equity capital can improve an insurer's claims paying
ability," the rating agency said, adding that the same holds true with
surplus notes issued by mutuals.
        DCR acknowledges that there are some regulatory concerns that hang
over the market but says they are too often misunderstood. "Regulatory
risks can be more direct for surplus notes than for holding company debt
because of the ... ability of the regulator to directly suspend interest
and principal payments on a surplus note without putting the note into
default," the rating agency conceded.
        But it added that regulators would be mindful of the message that
such drastic measures would send in disrupting sales and the ability of an
issuer to meet policyholder obligations. It said suspension of surplus
notes payments will occur only "in extreme circumstances."
        DCR also said investors can largely disregard the NAIC's official
position, for RBC purposes, that surplus notes are equivalent to preferred
stock.  This "is not tied to the riskiness of surplus notes, but rather
reflects regulatory policy aimed at discouraging insurers from investing in
surplus notes." This could lead to an unhealthy pyramiding of capital,
regulators believe.

QUESTIONS TO BE RAISED

These are questions the AICPA says businesses should be asking
about the impact of tax reform.
         What will be the new recordkeeping and reporting requirements? How
should computer software and information be changed? How will tax staffing
requirements change? How will tax staff be retrained?
         Should businesses reconfigure their multinational operations that
are structured around current rules?
         How are plans for business reorganizations affected by the change
to a replacement consumption tax?
         Given that interest is unlikely to be deductible, should
businesses consider greater use of equity financing? Should businesses
continue to provide health insurance to their employees?
         Should partnerships and sole proprietorships consider
incorporating now that they are subject to the same tax as corporations?
         With all forms of savings tax favored under a consumption tax,
should pension plans be altered?
         Will the Internal Revenue Service administer the new tax? Will its
budget over the transition have to be increased?
         What are the additional administrative costs of transitioning into
a new consumption tax?

NEW YORK UNVEILS CROWD-PLEASING REFORM

In an effort to open the playing field in New York, the state
Department of Insurance and the governor's office have offered up over 100,
or two-thirds, of the 150 insurance regulations to either dissolve or
partially dismantle in the largest regulatory reform effort in the
department's history.
        Superintendent of Insurance Ed Muhl and Gov. George Pataki issued a
joint release that was a celebration of the marketplace and the
possibilities repealing 24 regulations and reforming 77 of them could hold
for new, more and better insurance products.
        The reform weighed critical remarks from the industry and trade
associations in its process.
        For example, an unnamed property/casualty insurer called for
modification of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices regulation because
"significant market conduct scrutiny" of the regulation means "insurers
doing business in New York devote inordinate resources to creating paper
files and record trails."
        Thus, the standard claims form of Regulation 64 was identified by
department staff as a subject of potential modification.
        Others were identified for reform because of the changing
marketplace, with the heavy growth of managed care being a chief element of
that change.The rule governing minimum standards for sale of health
insurance, for example, while still the "core of regulatory authority in
the oversight of accident and health insurance," must be modified to meet
the needs of an HMO environment, the department wrote.
        Regulations deemed repealable for reasons of obsolescence or burden
to insurers included those governing standard claims forms for health
insurance, investments in revenue bonds, mortgages as authorized
investments, underwriting discrimination against females, audited financial
statements and mass merchandising of personal coverage.
        The department estimated that the reform package will result in an
annual savings to the industry of $25 million to $40 million.
        "Regulation always imposes costs, both on the regulated industry
and the consumer.... Regulations that do not serve the public interest will
be either discarded or revised," Muhl stated.
        The reform effort was made at the mandate of Pataki to cut red tape
in business in an executive order early last year. The governor also
indicated then that new regulations would be subject to a "rigorous cost-
benefit analysis."
        Trade groups such as the Alliance of American Insurers are pleased
with the outcome of the governor's order.
        "We sent in quite a package of recommendations and are pleased to
say that some of them are in the areas that Pataki has slated for reform,"
said John Cucci, vice president of the northeast region for the Alliance.
        One, for example, that was of real concern was Regulation 68,
overseeing auto no-fault insurance.
        "Under the present provisions, a doctor could be treating a victim
for nine months before the insurer even knows about it. That creates room
for fraud. We suggested a 10 day report time," Cucci said.

TEXAS TO CURB WORKERS COMP

Aetna, Allstate, Zurich and 14 other insurer groups must cut their
workers comp rates or justify them to the Texas Insurance Department unless
they want to face possible rollback hearings, the TDI said.
        The TDI gave the insurers, which have a total of 74 companies
writing workers comp insurance, a Feb. 1 deadline to respond.
        Many companies cut their rates in response to savings from the 1989
reform law upheld by the Texas Supreme Court last February and losses
dropped dramatically, but some carriers have persisted in charging higher
rates, TDI Commissioner Elton Bomer charged.
        "These letters should come as no surprise to the insurance
companies. The carriers have known for months of my concern that workers'
compensation rates are too high, particularly rates for small businesses,"
Bomer said. "TDI's patience has worn thin."
        On average, rates are too high by 4% to 17% based on data from 271
companies, according to a recent analysis prepared by TDI's actuarial
consultant.But, losses in 1994 were more than half of what they would have
been without the reforms, the analysis showed. The state comp fund was also
included in the analysis.
        A Texas law that took effect in 1992 allows insurers to set their
own workers' comp rates. The law specifies, though, that rates may not
excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
        Bomer can disapprove rates that violate that standard and can fine
a company that consistently overcharges.
        Letters were also sent to American States, General Accident, Great
American, Gulf, Houston General, Indiana Lumbermens, Nationwide, Old
Republic, Reliance, Royal, Sentry, State Farm, Tokio Marine and Unitrin.

OCC LAYS PLANS FOR INSURANCE OVERSIGHT

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has created a task
force to examine how national bank insurance agency activities should be
supervised and examined if the industry wins the Barnett case, in which
oral arguments are scheduled before the high court Jan. 16.
        The OCC won banking industry support Jan. 4 to determine how it
should react if the Supreme Court determines that Section 92 of the
National Bank Act, which says banks can sell insurance from offices in
towns of 5,000 or fewer, preempts state laws barring certain banks from
conducting such activities. "They are laying the groundwork for determining
quickly how national bank insurance activities should be supervised," said
one banker familiar with the meeting, held at OCC offices.
        Among the questions asked at the session, according to one banker,
is whom the agency should consult before finalizing its rules. Among those
who should be involved, it was suggested, were state insurance
commissioners and bank and insurance trade groups
        The areas to be examined include what types of licenses should be
required of national banks selling insurance from offices in small towns.
        Another crucial area is whether the rules outlined by the OCC for
national bank insurance sales should be guidelines or regulations. The
difference is that violations of guidelines is subject to wrist-slapping;
violations of regulations bring down the whole panoply of fines, dismissals
and bank takeover mandated in potentially harsh federal bank enforcement
statutes. For example, violation of federal bank agency cease and desist
orders can bring fines of up to $1 million a day against institutions as
well as their officers and directors.
        The agency decided to proceed after a meeting with representatives
of the American Bankers Association and the Bankers Roundtable. According
to several bankers who attended the session, those briefing the bankers
included Konrad Alt, chief assistant to Comptroller Eugene A. Ludwig, and
Julie Williams, agency chief counsel. A decision on what to do next was
expected by Jan. 15.

HANCOCK FINED FOR CHURNING

Another life insurer has joined the ranks of those that have been
accused of being tangled in a culture of improper sales practices. This
time, it's costing $1 million.
        In the shadow of the looming New York State Supreme court decision
on the settlement of New York Life's sales practices, the New York
Insurance Department fined John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. Jan. 3
for more than a decade of numerous violations ranging from the company's
advertising practices to charges of churning.
        The Boston-based company admitted to the violations, signed a
stipulation and has paid the fine on violations occurring between 1983 to
1994. The stipulation listed violations for improper advertising, sales
practices and form filing. John Hancock also agreed to mend its ways so
such failures would not again occur. The company released a statement
saying there are now sales practice and advertising safeguards in place
that are working well.
        It also said the issues "raised by New York are no longer
problems." John Hancock tried to distance itself from the unauthorized
activities by noting they were primarily done by individual agents and
employees and "not John Hancock itself."
        The stipulation will also be provided to John Hancock's board of
directors and the company will cooperate with the department in any further
disciplinary actions against current or former agents, managers and
employees involved in the violations, according to the terms of the
stipulation.
        New York has announced a move toward deregulation, but violations
such as those identified at John Hancock are likely to come under closer
scrutiny. The department's Reg 60 is one of the few targeted for tougher
oversight by the department, which recently released a report promoting
modification or repeal of over 100 state insurance regs.

GEORGIA BLUES' CONVERSION GETS GREEN LIGHT

The conversion plan of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia Inc. has
been approved by the state insurance department with only minor adjustments
barely a month after a public hearing in November, pushing it closer to
becoming the first member plan to restructure and setting the stage for a
trip to the private placement market.
        One of the pair of conditions increases the number of directors
elected by the over 160,000 policyholders from two to six to increase their
voice, the department stated. The policyholders will become stockholders
when the conversion is completed.
        The second condition prevents the name from changing to Cerulean,
as proposed in the plan submitted by Blue Cross late in October.
        The approval of Commissioner John Oxendine, though expected, marks
one of the first approvals of a Blue Cross conversion to a for-profit. The
conversion process in other states such as California and Maryland has been
fraught with discord involving merger and acquisition terms and the use of
nonprofit funds in public charity foundations.
        "This could be the first, but we'll have to wait and see," said a
spokesperson for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
        "The climate is different in each state and in every state the
entities need to look at their own climate. What works in Georgia may not
work in another place" she said.
        "The next step is the private placement, and then the registration
statement needs to be approved by the SEC," the Georgia Blues spokesperson
stated.
        "Under the plan every effort has been made to protect policyholders
while paving the way for the company to stay competitive in the ever-
changing health insurance market," Oxendine stated.

KEMPER UPGRADE FOLLOWS MERGER

Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the senior debt rating of
Kemper Corp., to A1 from Baa2, the insurance financial strength rating of
its life subsidiaries to Aa3 from Baa1.
        The rating agency took the action after Zurich Insurance Group and
Investment Partners said it completed its acquisition of Kemper. It said
the action was based on the strength of the companies' ultimate parent,
Zurich Insurance Co., which plans to sell off Kemper's troubled commercial
real holdings.
        The two subsidiaries are Federal Kemper Life Assurance Co. and
Kemper Investors Life Insurance Co.

FASB EXTRACTS LEASES FROM HEDGING PROJECT

The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly the
scope of the hedging and derivatives project  Dec. 21 when it decided that
leases would not be included.
        The project, in its current form, provides the option of marking
derivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While other
financial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to account
for leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.
        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that it
would expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, a
FASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with the
issues that most concern hedging and derivatives."
        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of the
project, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not to
include leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to the
difficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the lease
from the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedging
project, he said.
        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack of
valuation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicated
issues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in the
derivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on the
capitalization or valuation of all leases.
        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change in
the value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,
should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and that
the interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.
        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,
related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earnings
on a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain on
a purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent that
expense has been recognized for the option premium paid.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TAKES TINY STEP FORWARD

The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how to
report accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments and
cumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should be
reported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.
        The decision represents at least another minor step forward in
FASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late fall
and seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in the
income statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when it
tentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive income
should be reported in one or more statements of income for financial
performance.
        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are by
examining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, of
which only the latter is currently included in net income. The matter
becomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported as
cumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-period
adjustments in others.
        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to develop
examples illustrating the three different approaches for reporting
accounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first one
is the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensive
income strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,
referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive income
broadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excluding
accounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report both
comprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustments
displayed as the difference between the two.
        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that any
of these three approaches would be workable if they were applied
consistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quo
approach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistent
with either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-
inclusive concept.
        The Board members expressed concerns about the effects on other
financial statements.

ACSEC TO EXPLORE BALANCE SHEET

The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a new
project to determine when various types of securities transactions should
be recorded on the balance sheet.
        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, in
accordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where the
counterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingent
transactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred to
as "to-be-announced" trades.
        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types of
transactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date or
on the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice as
to when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions among
users of the instruments.
