<H2>How Do Neuroleptics Reduce Psychosis?</H2></center>

 <HR>


	More than 50 years after the first neuroleptic was introduced as an antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia, researchers are still trying to figure out just how these drugs work, according to a note in The American Journal of Psychiatry.  They know that the neuroleptic's action starts by blocking dopamine receptors, but the pathways through which the drug acts in the brain to reduce psychosis remains unknown.  Holcomb et al. ("Functional Sites of Neuroleptic Drug Action in the Human Brain: PET/FDG Studies With and Without Haloperidol," p 41, January 1996) studies a group of patients with schizophrenia who were taking haloperidol and used positron emission tomography and a measure of glucose (sugar) utilization to measure regional functional changes in neuronal activity.  
<P>
	Measurements were taken while the patients were taking the drug, five days after discontinuing the drug, and 30 to 35 days after haloperidol discontinuation.  There were no significant differences found after five days off the drug, suggesting that effects of discontinuation are not rapid, but differences were seen at 30 to 35 days.  
<P>
	This study helps explain the effectiveness of neuroleptics, since haloperidol decreased glucose utilization in areas in which functional alterations can lead to psychosis.
