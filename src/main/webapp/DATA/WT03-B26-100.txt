<BR>
SPOT satellites orbit in a polar, sun-synchronous circle; they maintain
the same angle to the sun above any given ground point. Passing overhead
at the same local time each day, SPOT satellites always see ground sites
in the same conditions of light and shade, allowing comparison of subsequent
images. <BR>
<BR>
SPOT overflies every point on the Earth's surface at least every 26 days,
but can resample locations more often, utilising the telescopes' sideways
viewing ability (<A HREF="box3.htm">SPOT Images</A>). Resample frequency
varies with latitude: at the equator, a given area can be imaged 7 times
during the 26 day cycle; sites at latitude 45&#176; can be imaged 11 times.
<BR>
<BR>
All SPOT satellites are in the same orbit, though in different phases, so
they can be tracked and monitored in sequence by the same network of groundstations.
<BR>
<BR>
SPOT carries two identical HRV (High Resolution Visible) instruments, each
attached to telescopes capable of 770,000x magnification. Mirrors at the
mouths of each telescope swivel according to programmed ground instructions,
giving viewing angles of 27 from the vertical, and a 950 km viewing window
each orbit. <BR>
