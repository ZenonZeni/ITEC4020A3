<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Every year, growers are assessed

about $700 million to support research and promotion of commodities

that range from milk to grapes.  Many farmers are beginning to

challenge these mandatory assessments and, in June 1996, the US

Supreme Court agreed to review a 1995 decision of the 9th US Circuit

Court of Appeals in San Francisco that declared unconstitutional

mandatory grower assessments of about $0.20 per 20 pound carton

of fresh fruit to generate $10 to $20 million per year to support

generic advertising of peaches, plums and nectarines (&quot;summer

fruits&quot;).</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The case began in April 1987,

when several California packers petitioned USDA to stop collecting

the mandatory assessments, which total about $1 billion from all

kinds of farmers and support research and promotion for commodities

from California avocados to Vidalia onions.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The 9th Circuit decision held

that USDA can compel growers to pay mandatory assessments if the

government can prove that there is a government interest in increasing

the consumption of the commodity being promoted, that generic

advertising increases consumption, and that there is minimal infringement

of grower rights.  The court said that the burden of proof is

on the commodity boards to prove that their advertising is useful

to growers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The California grower-packers

who brought the suit argued that they want to spend their promotion

moneys advertising their own brand, not peaches in general.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In October 1996, Delano Farms,

a major California table grape grower that shipped 1.7 million

boxes of grapes in 1996, sued the California Table Grape Commission,

charging that mandatory assessments that raise $12.5 million each

year to promote grapes are an unconstitutional infringement on

 promotions.<BR>
