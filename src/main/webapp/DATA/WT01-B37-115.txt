<h1>The Risk of Heroin Overdose </h1>

<p> <b>Copied from p.56 (Box 5-1) of 'Drugs and Behavior' by
William A. McKim.</b> </p>

<p> One of the greatest risks of being a heroin addict is death
from heroin overdose. Each year about one percent of all heroin
addicts in the United States die from an overdose of heroin
despite having developed a fantastic tolerance to the effects of
the dr ug. In a nontolerant person the estimated lethal dose of
heroin may range from 200 to 500 mg, but addicts have tolerated
doses as high as 1800 mg without even being sick[1]. No doubt,
some overdoses are a result of mixing heroin with other drugs,
but appear to result from a sudden loss of tolerance. Addicts
have been killed one day by a dose that was readily tolerated the
day before. An explanation for this sudden loss of tolerance has
been suggested by Shepard Siegel of McMaster University, and his
a ssociated, Riley Hinson, Marvin Krank, and Jane McCully. </p>

<p> Siegel reasoned that the tolerance to heroin was partially
conditioned to the environment where the drug was normally
administered. If the drug is consumed in a new setting, much of
the conditioned tolerance will disappear and the addict will be
more likely to overdose. To test this theory Siegel and
associates ran the following experiment[2]. </p>

<p> Rats were given daily intravenous injections for 30 days. The
injections were either a dextrose placebo or heroin and they were
given in either the animal colony or a different room where there
was a constant white noise. </p>

<p> The drug and the placebo were given on alternate days and the
drug condition always corresponded with a particular environment
so that for some rats, the heroin was always administered in the
white noise room and the placebo was always given in the colony.
For other rats the heroin ways given in the colony and the
placebo was always given in the white noise room. Another group
of rats served as a control: these were injected in different
rooms on alternate dates, but were only injected with the
dextrose and had no experience with the heroin at all. </p>

<p> All rats were then injected with a large dose of heroin: 15.0
mg/kg. The rats in one group were given the heroin in the same
room where they had previously been given heroin. (This was
labeled the ST group.) The other rats, the DT group, were given
the he roin in the room where they had previously been given the
placebo. </p>

<p> Siegel found that 96 percent of the control group died,
showing the lethal effect of the heroin in nontolerant animals.
Rats in the DT group who receieved heroin were partially
tolerant, and only 64 percent died. Only 32 percent of ST rats
died, showing t hat the tolerance was even greater when the
overdose test was done in the same environment where the drug
previously had been administered. </p>

<p> Siegel suggested that one reason addicts suddenly lose their
tolerance could be because they take the drug in a different or
unusual environment like the rats in the DT group. Surveys of
heroin addicts admitted to hospitals suffering from heroin
overdose tend to support this conclusion. </p>

<p> Many addicts report that they had taken the near-fatal dose
in an unusual circumstance or that their normal pattern was
different on that day[2]. </p>
