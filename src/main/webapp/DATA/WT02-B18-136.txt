    <h1 align="center">Biller Blasts Panel's Call for CPI 'Fix'!</h1>
    <h1 align="center"><img src="images/cnbcpic.gif"
    align="bottom" width="550" height="301"></h1>
    <p>APWU President Moe Biller appeared on nationwide
    television on Wednesday, December 4, 1996 to lodge the
    union's objections to a report issued earlier in the day
    calling for a radical downward adjustment of the government's
    leading measure of inflation--the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
    The so-called &quot;Boskin Commission&quot; report, named
    after a panel of five economists appointed by the Senate
    Finance Committee and chaired by Bush administration
    economist Michael Boskin, claimed that the government's
    inflation index has been overstated by approximately 1.1
    percentage points and should be adjusted accordingly. The
    result would be increased tax payments for all working
    Americans and reduced cost-of-living adjustments for postal
    workers, postal/federal annuitants, people on Social Security
    and families receiving food stamps. </p>
    <p><strong>&quot;I think that it appears to me to be a
    political ploy with cover by economists who are selected on a
    biased basis,&quot; Biller said. &quot;The entire thing is a
    political ploy to reduce benefits to a quarter of the
    American population--43 million Social Security recipients, 3
    million federal and postal annuitants and 6 million people on
    food stamps--and that's a disgrace. I think the politicians
    involved ought to be ashamed of themselves....It's a
    bipartisan effort to shaft the people.&quot; </strong></p>
    <p>In the photo above, Biller is shown speaking from
    Washington with CNBC's Terry Keenan in the network studios
    outside of New York City. Biller appeared on CNBC's
    &quot;Market Wrap&quot; report, which airs worldwide at the
    close of the stock market each weekday. See the January issue
    of The American Postal Worker for more on the Boskin
    Commission report and APWU's response. </p>

<h1 align="center">Open Season Continued</h1>
<h1 align="center">For APWU Health Plan!</h1>
<p><strong>USPS personnel offices have been authorized to accept
belated enrollment in the APWU Health Plan through the close of
business on Friday, December 20, 1996. This is due to failure by
the company contracted to distribute the 1997 FEHB (Federal
Employees Health Benefits) Guide to meet the mailing deadlines
and to fulfill other requirements. </strong></p>
<p>FEHB Open Season elections will be accepted, without question,
until December 20. After December 20, an employee may still
request a belated election, but the personnel office will not
automatically accept the election without determining whether the
inability to register was due to circumstances beyond the
employee's control. </p>
<p><b>How to Enroll in the APWU Health Plan</b> </p>
<p>Open Season elections are effective January 4, 1997. To join
the APWU Health Plan, go to your personnel office or postmaster
and request a Health Benefits Registration Form (Standard Form
2809). On the form, indicate <b>Code 471</b> for Self Only
coverage or <b>Code 472</b> for Self and Family enrollment. For
1997, active postal employees pay only <b>$10.70</b> biweekly for
Self Only coverage, just <b>$25.21</b> biweekly for Self and
Family. </p>
<p><b>Check Out the Health Plan&#146;s Great Benefits</b> </p>
<p>For details on the many benefits offered by the APWU Health
Plan, please refer to the October and November issues of The
American Postal Worker or the October 3 News Service bulletin. Or
call the plan's Open Season hotline at <b>1-800-PIC-APWU
(742-2798); </b>TDD/Deaf, <b>1-800-622-2511. </b>You can also

<h1 align="center">Locals Notified of Potential 'Sharps' Hazard </h1>
<p><strong>On November 21, 1996, APWU national headquarters
notified all local presidents, regional coordinators and NBAs of
a potential serious safety and health problem. The
Becton-Dickinson Company recently offered a rebate to customers
who mail back to the company their used syringes and needles.
Some of these customers have been sending improperly packaged
syringes and needles to the company, located in Young America,
MN. If not handled appropriately, these improperly packaged
medical devices may injure employees and expose them to blood
infected with, for example, the hepatitis virus. </strong></p>
<p>Although the company is making attempts to contact its
customers to instruct them not to mail syringes, some of these
improperly packaged medical sharps may already be in the
mailstream. </p>
<p>Local unions were advised by national headquarters to inform
workers and to meet with local management to encourage them to
make all employees, especially window clerks, aware of the
potential problem. Also, USPS headquarters has instructed local
managers to update their bloodborne disease exposure response
plan, reissue the post-incident protocol, and establish
preventive procedures from acceptance to delivery. </p>
<p>APWU headquarters also sent locals a copy of a letter from
USPS headquarters alerting the union to the potential hazard, and
a copy of Management Instruction EL-810-92-4, Bloodborne Disease
Exposure Control Plans. The Management Instruction details the
procedures to prevent exposure to blood and infectious materials,
as well as the steps to take if an employee is exposed. Locals
were advised to review this policy and determine if local
management is abiding by its requirements. </p>
