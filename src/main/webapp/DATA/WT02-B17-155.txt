<h2>FEMP's New Energy Efficiency Awareness Campaign: <I>You Have the Power</I></h2>

Federal energy and facility managers have already proven it to
FEMP and now FEMP wants to help prove it to the rest of the Federal
community.  FEMP's mission to save energy, save money, and
increase the use of green products is well underway.  Since 1985,
Federal energy and facility managers have achieved $11.2 billion
in cost savings.  They have ignited the economy by creating partnerships
with the private sector and stimulated new markets for energy
efficient products.
<P>
To continue their good work, FEMP recognizes that Federal energy
and facility managers will need all the tools they can get in
order to accomplish their energy saving goals.  FEMP relies on
an extensive education and outreach program to help its customers
make sound energy investment decisions and obtain feedback about
their needs and general market environment.  
<P>
With the help of an interagency committee, a two-pronged educational
approach was identified to facilitate implementation of energy
efficiency, renewable energy, and water conservation projects
and promote the importance of using energy wisely throughout the
Federal sector.  To that end, FEMP is launching an exciting, multi-year
educational campaign aimed at better serving FEMP's customers
and achieving improved information goals.  The campaign will rely
on an integrated communications infrastructure that will improve
the flow of FEMP information, products, and services; rely on
a network of partners; and move FEMP customers through the process
of awareness, interest, commitment, and ultimately action. 
<P>
The theme of FEMP's information campaign is <I>You Have the
Power,</I> and as the title suggests, FEMP will be working to
encourage and motivate Federal energy and facility managers into
action.  FEMP announced its campaign at TeleFEMP Broadcast IV
(September 26, 1996) and introduced a sampling of new and valuable
products for meeting the information needs of the Federal energy
and facility manager.  New information tools include energy efficiency
awareness computer messages, posters, action kits, and other reminders
to use energy wisely. Through the FEMP information campaign, a
positive reflection will be cast on the good work of the energy
and facility managers as well as all Federal workers!
