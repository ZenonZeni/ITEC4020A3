<B>MNR Expands Restricted Fire Zone
</B>

</CENTER><P>




       

      Because of extremely dry forest conditions, combined with the high
        number of fires already burning across Ontario, the Ministry of Natural
        Resources has significantly expanded the Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ)
        currently in effect in Ontario.<P>

        "Effective midnight tonight, the Restricted Fire Zone now will include
        the MNR districts of Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, and all of
        Manitoulin Island," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.
        "This is a serious fire situation and we are using all our resources to
        control it."<P>

        The RFZ, first introduced at noon Friday June 14, covers all of
        northwestern Ontario and those parts of northeastern Ontario located
        north of a line running from the Quebec border at Mattawa and along
        Highway 17 and the French River.<P><P>

        There are currently more than 200 fires burning in the province,
        covering an area of about 230,000 hectares. Sixty-one of these fires
are considered problem fires. There have been more than 370 new forest
        fires reported in Ontario between Tuesday June 11 and Tuesday June 18.<P>

        "Our provincial fire program is responding efficiently and quickly to
        ensure human safety and the protection of valuable resources," said
        Mr. Hodgson. "I'm pleased that the forest industry is also pitching in
        by curtailing a lot of its regular harvest activities, and providing
        suppression assistance with crews and heavy equipment," Mr. Hodgson
        added.<P>

        Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all
        open fires are prohibited, including fires for cooking or warmth.  The
        regulation does permit the use of portable stoves or charcoal
        installations, but the public is asked to exercise caution.<P>

        "High temperatures and windy conditions, which cause erratic and
        dangerous fire behavior, are expected to continue for the next few
        days," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The danger of new forest fires starting will
        remain extremely high. We are seeking the public's cooperation in
        helping to prevent any new starts as a result of  human activity."<P>
