Mildura and the surrounding district is pressing ahead with exciting
plans for the short, medium and long-term future.  The first irrigation
colony established in Australia, Sunraysia has become a desert
garden at the heart of Australia's two major rivers, the Murray
and the Darling.
<P>
The approach to the town is lush and in marked contrast to the
surrounding harsh, dry landscape.  Sunraysia is a planned district
and has many major developments on the drawing board.
<P>
Mildura has a well developed transport system, with excellent
road and rail facilities and a double runway airport capable of
receiving freight and passenger planes up to Fokker F-28s and
BAE 146 aeroplanes.

<H2>International opportunities</H2>
<P>
<img src="gifs2/mildura1.gif" align=right>
A visit from the Italian supermarket buyers, the first of many
co-ordinated by the Sunraysia Development Corporation,
has reinvigorated local horticultural producers, many of whom
have participated in a Clean Foods consultancy and investigation
and an AusIndustry networking grant.  The
funding has assisted growers to form networks and handle international
inquiries, and will enable them to investigate international markets.
<P>
The opportunities for businesses looking into value-adding industries
are excellent.  Mildura is at the forefront of supplying international
markets with value-added horticultural goods.
<P>
Sunraysia is a world leader in the total quality management of
dried fruits.  The Australian Dried Fruits Association, based
in Sunraysia, has stringent industry controls to ensure that growers
supply the best quality fruits of a uniform standard.
<P>
The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation has worked
with local citrus growers to institute a Farm Quality Management
system to complement the total quality management accreditation
that most citrus packing sheds already have.
<P>
One quarter of Australia's citrus fruit is produced in the Sunraysia,
and the district continues to explore value-adding and packaging
improvements to gain world marketing advantages.  The district
is gaining an excellent reputation as a significant supplier of
wine grapes, asparagus, avocados, and other fruits and vegetables.
<P>
New opportunities being explored include standard horticulture
as well as more unusual ventures.  A deposit of bentonite
has been found near Mildura.  Bentonite is used in the production of
cat litter,
which Australia has traditionally imported.  Product development
in diverse areas offer the region genuine opportunities to develop
non-agricultural products.
<H2>Bulk wine production specialty</H2>

<P>
The Sunraysia District is the home of some of Australia's well-known
wine houses.  The site of Southcorp Wines'national bottling plant,
Stanley Cask and Bulk Wines, and a major plant of Mildara Blass
Wines, the district has many smaller independent wine makers of
which the district is proud.  The wine industry increases opportunities
for related industries to establish operations locally.
<P>
Many industrial sites available for immediate use are serviced
with sewerage, power and water.  Local confidence in the Sunraysia
District is backed by plans to make more land available.  Municipalities
in the district are fully supportive of businesses seriously planning
to establish or expand in the district.
<P>
Co-operation from the Sunraysia Development Corporation, Small
Business Victoria and Business Victoria is guaranteed.
The expertise of these agencies in developing and new businesses
is highly valued.
<H2>A vision for tourism</H2>

<P>
Ideas and impetus for new tourism developments come from a wide
range of
expertise including community groups and national development
companies. There is genuine excitement locally over proposals
for the region.  The fabulous weather year-round and the Murray
and Darling Rivers present an enticing and relaxing vista for
visitors and residents.
<P>
Sunraysia plans to develop Australia's first irrigation plants,
which were decommissioned during the 1950s and are now recognised
as one of the district's major historical features.
<P>
The triple-expansion marine engine with centrifugal pumps was
designed and manufactured specifically to draw water for the irrigation
district.  It is being faithfully restored to become part of a
working display of irrigation in Australia; an integral part of
the district's historic and cultural past, present and future.
<P>
The Murray Marina Development will focus on the city's mid-city
river vista. Plans include a convention/hotel centre, restaurants,
shops, a marina, riverfront apartments and serviced suites.  This
European-style development will provide world-class facilities
in a beautiful setting and should attract national and international
conferences.
<P>
Sunraysia already attracts sporting and conference events of national
importance. The Mildura Lawn Tennis Association boasts thirty-two
world-class lawn tennis courts, and these and the district's golf
courses attract events such as the McDonalds Junior Tennis Championship,
the Mobil Easter Tennis Classic and the Murray-Darling Gold Classic.
<P>
All levels of accommodation and catering are already available
in Sunraysia, the sporting venues are of an extremely high standard,
and excellent weather poises the district perfectly for development.
<H2>The best in education</H2>

<P>
Sunraysia is justly proud of its post-secondary education facilities,
such as the Mildura and District Education Council and the Sunraysia
College of TAFE.  Both provide courses for initial training or
re-skilling.  The Sunraysia College of'TAFE provides traditional
TAFE courses and offers some degree course education through its
links with La Trobe University. Mildura has ample primary and
secondary schools, and a great number of VCE subjects is offered.
