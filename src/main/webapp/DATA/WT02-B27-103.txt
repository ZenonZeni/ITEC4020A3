<BR><BR><BR>
Questions similar to these have been asked for centuries.  Educational research has sought answers to them for over 100 years.  This course will explore the research and issues concerned with answering these and similar questions.
<P>
Substantial changes have occurred recently in the way educational researchers think about and conduct research on teaching and learning.  Students typically are seen as active, self-regulated learners who construct their own interpretations and meaning for various kinds of information in the learning environment, including information provided by the teacher.  Social context, motivation, and interpersonal communication -- as well as cognition and subject-matter content -- are considered to be important contributors to student learning.
<P>
Nevertheless, the issue remains as to what role the teacher plays in the teaching-learning process and the way he or she influences student learning and achievement.  Given the changes in the field that have occurred in recent years, relevant issues will be explored in addition to the empirical literature concerned with research on teaching and its affect on student learning.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Purpose for Conducting Research on Teaching</H3>

There are two main reasons for doing research on teaching.  These two purposes are related, but there are some important differences between them.  The first purpose is to understand the nature of teaching and its relationship to student learning.  This purpose is akin to scholarly and scientific investigation in general.  Consequently, it will be referred to here it as the <I>intellectual</I> purpose.  The other purpose is to improve the quality of teaching, and it will be referred to as the <I>practical</I> purpose.  Both approaches will be discussed in the course, as well as the difference between them.
<P>
All research begins with a question.  One way to better understand the differences between the two purposes mentioned in the preceding paragraph is to examine the types of questions asked by individuals pursuing with each purpose.  Examine the questions in the table on the next page and check your understanding of the two types of research by generating one or two questions that represent each one.</P>

The perspective of this course is one in which student learning is viewed as the goal of teaching and a belief that far more is known about the nature of effective teaching than is often acknowledged.  Nevertheless, teaching is an extremely complex endeavor and straight forward solutions to the many problems facing educators are not available.
<P>
A number of issues are involved in trying to understand the teaching-learning process and how it might be improved.  Although often there is a tendency to think of the cognitive aspects of teaching and school learning, social, emotional, motivational and other non-cognitive factors also are involved.  With these considerations in mind, some of the issues that will be pursued in this course include the following.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Role of the Teacher</H3>

The way teaching and the teacher are conceptualized has important implications for both research and practice.  Is the teacher best thought of as: (1) a disseminator of information and knowledge, (2) an executive decision maker, (3) an orchestra conductor, (4) a midwife, or in some other way that you may have in mind?  Is the role of the student best thought of as work or as learning?  What implications do these metaphors have on the way schooling is understood?  On the extent to which teaching can be "improved?"  These types of issues will be discussed during the semester.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Teaching and Learning</H3>

Every teacher, educational researcher, parent, and student has his or her own implicit model of learning.  This model of learning influences the wide variety of decisions that are made with regard how one (teacher and student alike) engages in the teaching-learning process.  What model do you ascribe to?  Some possible ones include (1) passive reception, (2) discovery, (3) knowledge deficit and accrual, and (4) guided construction.  How does your personal model of learning affect the way you think about teaching?  The type of research you conduct?  The way you teach in your classroom?
<P>
Can teaching be meaningfully conceptualized without regard to whether student learning occurs as a result of that "teaching?"  John Dewey once compared teaching to selling, arguing that it makes no more sense to talk about someone have taught something without student learning than it does to say that something was sold unless someone bought the item.  Do you agree?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Student Mediation of Instruction</H3>

The affects of what a teacher does never has a direct effect on student learning.  Students perceive very different things and react in very different ways to what the teacher does.  Not only cognitive factors are involved, either.  Social, emotional, and other factors, as well as cognitive factors, influence the way in which teaching affects the learner.  In the Handbook of Research on Teaching (3rd ed.), Lee Shulman presents the following diagram: Shulman's TEACHING --> <FONT SIZE=-2>SOCIAL MEDIATION</FONT> --> <FONT SIZE=-2>COGNITIVE MEDIATION</FONT> --> LEARNING.  Can you explain what Shulman had in mind?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Application --> The Relationship<BR> 
Between Theory/Research and Practice</H3>

Much of what is understood about teaching never gets translated into educational practices.  Teaching is not unique in this regard, but that is the focus of this course.  There is a tendency to think of scientific knowledge being "applied" to practice, but is this really the best way to think about the relationship between theory and research concerned with effective teaching and the improvement of educational practices?  Is the "flow" of knowledge one way or two way?
<P>
Various ways of thinking about or conceptualizing this relationship will be considered in the course.  Among the issues to be discussed will be the question of whether certain models/conceptions are more productive with regard to research and with regard to practice.
