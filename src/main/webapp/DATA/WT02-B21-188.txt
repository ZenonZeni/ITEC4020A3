SURVEY.NET is a public service system on the Internet.  It's based around a powerful
survey engine developed by Mike Perry, who also administers the site.
There is NO direct commercial
influence; there is no PAC or political influence whatsoever.  There are a lot of sites
on the net which claim to be "unbiased", however SURVEY.NET endeavors to be the
standard by which all other sites are judged in the area of objectivity.
<P>
ICorp (Inter Commerce Corporation) is an Internet Service Provider and publishing company
located in New Orleans, LA which hosts SURVEY.NET.  This is essentially the only direct
affiliation SURVEY.NET has with any commercial entity, and the purpose for this is pretty
obvious - so I have a place to put my site on the Internet.  In return, it seems only fair
to do a little subtle PR for ICorp - and of course, if anyone wants to become a "sponsor",
I'll entertain offers, but in no way will the scope or content of SURVEY.NET be modified 
to appease any commercial or political entity.  This is the SURVEY.NET policy.
<P>
Rather than blabber on about something you might not be interested in, I've broken down
relevant information into several categories:
<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/sv-faq.htm">The SURVEY.NET FAQ</A> - A wealth of commonly-asked
questions and answers - probably more than you want to know, but hopefully enlightening ans
possibly entertaining.

<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/license.htm">Info on Republishing Survey Data</A> - In general
I <I>strongly</I> encourage people to disseminate and publish the results generated online; all I
ask is that SURVEY.NET or myself receive credit.  More details can be found on this page.

<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/policy.htm">Official SURVEY.NET Policies</A> - This outlines
the few rules I have here regarding participation in the surveys, and what happens when the
rules are not followed.  

<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/compat.htm">Compatibility Issues With Browsers, Etc.</A> - Since
SURVEY.NET was introduced, we've had occasional reports of problems related to particular browsers
and systems in submitting surveys.  Some services such as AOL have proprietary browser software
which isn't very good at handling standard web forms - look here for more specific information.
