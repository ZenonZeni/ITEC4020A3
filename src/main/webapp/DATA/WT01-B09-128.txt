<B>Project Title:  Electric Vehicle Range Extending Generator<p>

Performing Organization:  AC Propulsion</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:	Alan Cocconi  (909) 592-5399</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>AC Propulsion will build on their strong experience in developing advanced power control systems for electric vehicles in this program by developing the first of a family of high-efficiency, high-output range-extending generators for hybrid electric vehicles.  The auxiliary power unit to be developed in this program will produce up to 20 kW of power continuously at a range of 300-400 V, with a weight of under 35 kg.  This generator will be integrated with a Moller International rotary engine, which produces 30 hp continuously at 5000 rpm.  Additionally, the Moller rotary engine will be designed to be very low emission, approaching the equivalent of emission levels of zero-emission vehicles.</P>

	<P>Once designed and integrated, the auxiliary power unit will be tested on a fully outfitted test stand, to measure power output, and thermal, electrical and overall efficiency.  The APU will also be tested in a battery charging application, using AC Propulsion electric vehicle batteries.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	

<P>During the first six months of the project, AC Propulsion will design and build the alternator and charging system.  By the ninth month of the project, the alternator will be integrated with the rotary engine and the stand tests will be underway.  Final reports will be completed in the 10th or 11th month of the project.</P>
