Executive Summary </B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER>
<P>The internal combustion engine (for cars, trucks, lawn mowers, motorcycles,
etc.) breathes in air and exhales exhaust. To operate efficiently, an internal
combustion engine must breathe efficiently. The more air received by each
engine cylinder during the combustion process, the more completely the fuel
will be burned, thereby reducing the cost of fuel and reducing the amount
of toxic emissions.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of the ACE Array Poppet Valve System is to improve the performance
of the inlet valves that allow air to enter into the engine cylinders during
the combustion process. In particular, the ACE Valve System greatly improves
the efficiency of a standard internal combustion engine by increasing the
volume of air entering an engine cylinder. It does so by enlarging the amount
of inlet opening area available when air is transferred into the cylinder.<BR>
<BR>
The increase in engine operational efficiency results in better gas mileage,
lower operating cost and a much cleaner burning engine, thereby, reducing
air pollution. <BR>
<BR>
Most car engines have one inlet valve per cylinder to allow air entry into
the engine. Some higher performance cars and race cars have as many as two
inlet valves for air entry into the engine. The ACE Array Poppet Valve System
uses three to four valves (as a clustered group) designed to allow more
air into the cylinder. This results in what is called an increase in volumetric
efficiency, which merely means that there is more air available inside any
given cylinder during engine operation.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>The ACE Array Poppet Valve System</B></CENTER>
<P>The innovative ACE Array Poppet Valve System narrows the extended intake
event while simultaneously increasing the amount of air and fuel within
an engine's cylinder head having the same limitation of 45% valve diameter
to bore diameter. This has been accomplished through miniaturization and
multiplication of valves.<BR>
<BR>
ACE has developed four miniature valves about the axis of the port's entry
into the combustion chamber. These valves are sized to one-half the diameter
of the standard single valve they replace. The Array Poppet Valve System
is seated with four one-half size valves, each having one-quarter the area
as the standard valve they replaced. The value of the Array Poppet Valve
System is that the combined circumferences of the four mini valves equate
to twice the circumference of the standard valve they replace. As a result,
only one-half the previously required valve lift distance is now required.
<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Utilization of the ACE Array Poppet Valve System to Improve
Engine Efficiency</B></CENTER>
<P>When the piston reaches top dead center (TDC) the Array Valve window
will be the same size as the standard valve would have been, except the
valve has been lifted off its valve seat 4.5 degrees later. The result is
less contamination of exhaust and intake gases during the valve overlap
period and improved emissions due to decrease in the valve overlap period.
A second point of improvement is the fully open window of environment (maximum
valve lift ) occurs earlier during the intake valve event to compliment
the maximum piston velocity period, resulting in improved filling of the
cylinder.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Single Cylinder Engines</B></CENTER>
<P>There are many inherent differences between single cylinder engines and
multiple cylinder engines. Single cylinder engines are designed as high
output engines in order to have positive horsepower to size ratios. One
difference is that the inlet valve opens 30 degrees before TDC, not 9 degrees,
and stays open 70 degrees after BDC (actually a portion of the compression
stroke) in order to have a very effective intake event (approximately 40
percent of the complete engine cycle). Incoming air and fuel is contaminated
by and mixed with the exhaust gases exiting due to the extended exhaust
and intake valve overlap at TDC. Fuel and air contained within the cylinder
after BDC expel due to the piston actually being in an effective velocity
during the early portion of the compression stroke, creating back pressure
in the direction of the carburetor while the intake valve is still open.
Consequently, single cylinder, high output engines create unacceptable emissions
and fuel consumption. <BR>
<BR>
The ACE Array Poppet Valve System can greatly improve the performance of
single cylinder engines by reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency.
The ACE System also allows the engine to run more smoothly, thereby reducing
the wear and fatigue brought about by excessive single cylinder engine operating
vibration.<BR>
<BR>
The ACE Array Poppet Valve System technology can be readily adapted to conventional
internal combustion engines without major changes in engine design. <BR>
<BR>
The multiple valve technology described herein is covered by U.S. and foreign
patents.
