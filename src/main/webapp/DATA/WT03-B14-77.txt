<font size="4"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy and accessibility of information is of equal importance. The companies who possess quick access to accurate information about waste streams, waste quantity and disposal history, generator history and marketing data have a distinct advantage over companies who do not. How organized are your company's records? Servicing your customer's needs is important and Facility Associate is the answer.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Work Orders and Customer Quotes</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work orders capture your customer's service needs quickly. Once service requests are complete, FA can quickly generate quotes, manifests, custom forms or custom letters. FA tracks all your work orders and quotes so you know when and how many are completed and eventually accepted. When you're ready, FA provides equipment and personnel scheduling to fulfill your customer's needs.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With FA, you can quickly pull reports showing outstanding work orders, work orders lacking quotes or quotes lacking work orders, quotes accepted, etc. for any time period. FA combines these tasks to provide your company with great customer service management tools.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Waste Stream Profiles</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FA's extensive profiling capability makes characterization of waste a snap. Track as little or as much information as you need. The system can even partition these profiles for easy generator client management, no need to wade through hundreds of profiles.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Container Labeling</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FA is designed to make container labeling a side effect of your other work instead of a job unto itself. Simply select a manifest and FA prints all the labels you will need in just about any format. Bar coding of waste turns outbound shipments into a painless task.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where you need a manifest quickly, simply choose a profile and a generator and you're done.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Bar Coding</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar coding containers makes your operations even more efficient. FA's bar coding option puts bar codes on all container labels allowing you to quickly ship and receive containers at your facility. 
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Lab Pack Support</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are faced with sorting, packing and tracking individual items in a lab-pack, FA can help you catalog, organize and even bar code these items. FA tracks all of your lab-pack items individually, the container in which they are stored, and the eventual destruction of the container's contents.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You begin by entering and categorizing each item in the system, optionally attaching a bar code. You then generate reports which group the items by compatibility class, physical characteristics, etc. And last, you assign each item to a container, optionally using the attached bar code to speed the process.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Disposal Facility Decision Support</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are faced with disposing of your client's waste off-site you want to choose dependable facilities which also provide a competitive price for their service. Facility Associate keeps up with all of your disposal facility pricing and where waste has gone historically. Drawing on this data, FA can provide you the information you need to quickly find a disposal site to match.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Waste Disposal History</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have recorded waste shipments, the system tracks the specific waste disposal costs for each shipment. The system automatically maintains a list of all shipments that have not been invoiced and allows you to quickly enter the disposal costs directly from the facility or contractor's invoice. You can easily request reports by waste stream/waste stream category (department) to pinpoint your waste disposal costs.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Custom Forms You Design</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facility Associate is flexible enough to handle just about any form you will need, even if they are specific to your company. The system contains a document editor which allows you to build upon the pre-designed forms. Should you need a special work order or quotation, simply start the editor, add your company logo and go from there!
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Facility State Reporting and Generator State Biennial Reporting (forms OI, WR and GM)</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facility Associate can print the forms and calculate taxes required by state regulatory agencies. Drawing on the existing manifesting and shipment data, the system can automatically generate these forms for you. At any time, management can access your company's current liability instantly. In some states, you can submit your reports using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some environmental consulting firms assist their customers with filing state regulatory reports. It typically only comes once every two years, but when the time comes, collecting all the detailed records can be tedious at best. Your company must track a tremendous amount of information concerning hazardous waste, EPA I.D. numbers, waste streams and classes, Facility information and disposal certification to complete these reports for state regulators.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facility Associate&#174 turns your state reporting nightmare into a dream. Using waste receipts and outgoing shipments already tracked through manifesting, the system combines all of the generator's information to automatically print the reports for you. Optionally, in some states you can submit the report using Electronics Data Interchange (EDI).
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Client Contact Management</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the most of your business contacts. Keep track of all manifesting, billing, and site contact information in one place. Keep notes of your dealings with your clients. Print mail-merged letters and forms instantly. Facility Associate&#174 does all of this easily to help you manage your business relationships more productively.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Inventory Cradle to Grave</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as waste begins accumulation, Facility Associate&#174 starts tracking the waste for eventual on-site disposal, on-site recycling, treatment or shipment to an off-site disposal facility. Facility Associate&#174 can handle repackaging of waste, consolidation of waste into other containers, tank storage and disposal processing. Special DRMR features make government work even easier.
