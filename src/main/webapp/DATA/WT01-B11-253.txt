</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Funds offered through this Prospectus consist
of seventeen Funds, each with distinct investment objectives and
policies: nine Equity Funds, three Balanced Funds and five Fixed
Income Funds. Most of the Funds invest their assets in singular
investment styles that correspond to their objectives. Of the
Equity Funds, two Funds - Diversified Equity Fund and Growth Equity
Fund - invest their assets in several different equity investment
styles. The use of multiple equity investment styles by each of
these Funds - through percentage allocations consistent with the
Fund's investment objective - is intended to reduce the risk associated
with the use of a single style, which may move in and out of favor
during the course of a market cycle. The Balanced Funds invest
specified percentages of their assets in accordance with the investment
styles of Diversified Equity Fund and three to five different
fixed income investment styles. The Balanced Funds rebalance their
portfolios periodically and Diversified Equity Fund and Growth
Equity Fund rebalance their portfolios daily to maintain specified
percentages of assets invested in particular investment styles.
The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a specified investment
style may be changed at any time by the Adviser in response to
market or other conditions. The investment objective, policies
and risk considerations of each Fund are described below. For
a further description of each Fund's investments and investment
techniques and additional risk considerations associated with
those investments and techniques, see &quot;Investment Objectives,
Investment Policies and Risk Considerations - Additional Investment
Policies,&quot; &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategies
and Risk Considerations&quot; and the SAI. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each of the Funds has its own distinct investment
objective which may not be changed without approval of the Fund's
shareholders. There can be no assurance that any Fund will achieve
its investment objective. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Equity Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Diversified Equity Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation
while moderating annual return volatility by diversifying its
investments in accordance with different equity investment styles.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Growth Equity Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> investment
objective is to provide a high level of long-term capital appreciation
while moderating annual return volatility by diversifying its
investments in accordance with different equity investment styles.
Because the Fund seeks increased returns, it is subject to correspondingly
greater risks than Diversified Equity Fund. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Contrarian Stock Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to seek capital appreciation by investing
primarily in common stocks for which the Adviser believes there
is significant potential for price appreciation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Small Company Stock Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is long-term capital appreciation. The Fund
pursues this objective by investing primarily in the common stock
of small and medium-size domestic companies which have a market
capitalization well below that of the average company in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Small Company Growth Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation
by investing primarily in small and medium-sized domestic companies
that are either growing rapidly or completing a period of significant
change. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>International Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> investment
objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing
directly or indirectly in high-quality companies based outside
the United States. International Portfolio, in which International
Fund invests all of its assets, has the same investment objective.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Large Company Growth Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation
by investing primarily in large, high-quality domestic companies
that the investment adviser believes have superior growth potential.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Income Equity Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> investment
objective is to provide both long-term capital appreciation in

dividend income. Index Fund's investment objective is to duplicate
the return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price
Index. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Balanced Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Conservative Balanced Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide a combination of current income
and capital appreciation by diversifying investment of the Fund's
assets among stocks, bonds and other fixed income investments.
The Fund emphasizes safety of principal through limited exposure
to equity securities. The Fund has the smallest equity securities
position of the three Balanced Funds. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Moderate Balanced Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide a combination of current income
and capital appreciation by diversifying investment of the Fund's
assets among stocks, bonds and other fixed income investments.
The Fund provides a portfolio more evenly-balanced between fixed
income and equity securities than the other Balanced Funds. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Growth Balanced Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide a combination of current income
and capital appreciation by diversifying investment of the Fund's
assets between stocks and bonds. The Fund has the largest equity
securities position of the Balanced Funds. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Fixed Income Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Intermediate U.S. Government Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide income and safety of principal
by investing primarily in U.S. Government Securities. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Managed Fixed Income Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to provide consistent fixed income returns
by investing primarily in a portfolio of intermediate maturity,
investment grade fixed income securities. <I>Effective April 1,
1996, Managed Fixed Income Fund, in pursuing its investment objective,
will begin investing its assets in two investment styles in addition
to the investment style currently employed and will be renamed
&quot;Diversified Bond Fund&quot; to reflect this change. <BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Total Return Bond Fund's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
investment objective is to seek total return. The Fund pursues
this objective by investing in a portfolio of U.S. Government
and investment grade corporate fixed income investments. Stable
Income Fund's investment objective is to maintain safety of principal
while providing low-volatility total return. Ready Cash Investment
Fund's investment objective is to provide high current income
to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and
the maintenance of liquidity. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>INVESTMENTS IN CORE TRUST</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>International Fund currently seeks to achieve its
investment objective by investing all of its investment assets
in International Portfolio, a separate Portfolio of Core Trust.
In addition, the Trust has received an exemptive order from the
SEC under which Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative
Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund and Growth Balanced Fund
(collectively the &quot;Blended Funds&quot;) currently invest
the portions of their assets that are managed in a small company,
an index and an international investment style, respectively,
in Small Company Portfolio, Index Portfolio, and International
Portfolio II (the &quot;Blended Portfolios&quot;). These Portfolios
are each separate portfolios of Core Trust. By pooling their assets
in the Blended Portfolios, the Blended Funds may be able to achieve
benefits that they could not achieve by investing directly in
securities. See &quot;Other Information - Core Trust Structure.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objectives and policies and investment
risk considerations for International Portfolio II and Index Portfolio
are identical to the investment objectives and policies and investment
risk considerations of International Fund and Index Fund. The
investment objective of Small Company Portfolio is to provide
long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in small
and medium-sized domestic companies that are either growing rapidly
or completing a period of significant change. This Portfolio invests
its assets in the investment styles of Small Company Stock Fund
and Small Company Growth Fund and a small company &quot;value&quot;
investment style described below; in the future, this Portfolio
may invest its assets in accordance with additional small company
investment styles. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>INVESTMENT POLICIES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Equity Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To achieve their investment objectives, the Equity
Funds invest primarily in common stocks and other equity securities.
International Fund currently invests exclusively in International
Portfolio which invests primarily in common stocks and other equity
securities of foreign issuers. See &quot;Other Information - Core
Trust Structure.&quot; The domestic securities in which an Equity
Fund invests are generally listed on a securities exchange or
included in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation (NASDAQ) National Market System but may be traded in
the over-the-counter securities market. Under normal circumstances,
each of the Equity Funds will invest substantially all of its
assets, but not less than 65 percent of its total assets, in equity
securities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Diversified Equity Fund</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
follows a &quot;multi-style&quot; approach designed to minimize
the volatility and risk of investing in equity securities. The
Fund's portfolio combines five different equity investment styles,
those of four of the Equity Funds - Large Company Growth Fund,
International Fund, Income Equity Fund and Index Fund - and a
small company investment style (the &quot;Small Company style&quot;)
that in turn utilizes the investment styles of Small Company Stock
Fund and Small Company Growth Fund (the &quot;Small Company Stock
Fund style&quot; and the &quot;Small Company Growth Fund style,&quot;
respectively) and a small company value investment style (the
&quot;Small Company Value style&quot;). The Fund utilizes different
equity investment styles in order to reduce the risk of price
and return volatility associated with reliance on a single investment
style. Because Diversified Equity Fund blends five equity investment
styles, it is anticipated that its price and return volatility
will be less than that of Growth Equity Fund, which blends three
equity investment styles. The Fund generally invests the following
percentages of its total assets in the indicated investment styles:

Investors should refer to the descriptions below of each of the
foregoing Equity Funds and Small Company style for a discussion
of the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investments
and investment techniques of those styles and, accordingly, of
the portions of Diversified Equity Fund invested in those styles.
The management of the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund's
six portfolio managers, including four who are also the portfolio
managers for corresponding Equity Funds. Three portfolio managers
jointly co-manage the assets allocated to the Small Company style.
The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a particular
investment style may be changed at any time by the Adviser in
response to market or other conditions. <BR>
<P>
<B>Growth Equity Fund</B> follows a &quot;multi-style&quot; approach
designed to reduce the volatility and risk of investing in equity
securities. The Fund's portfolio combines three different equity
investment styles, those of two of the Equity Funds - Large Company
Growth Fund and International Fund - and a small company investment
style (the &quot;Small Company style&quot;) that in turn utilizes
the investment styles of Small Company Stock Fund and Small Company
Growth Fund (the &quot;Small Company Stock Fund style&quot; and
the &quot;Small Company Growth Fund style,&quot; respectively)
and a small company value investment style (the &quot;Small Company
Value style&quot;). The Fund utilizes different equity investment
styles in order to reduce the risk of price and return volatility
associated with reliance on a single investment style. It is anticipated
that the Fund's price and return volatility will be somewhat greater
than those of Diversified Equity Fund, which blends five equity
investment styles. The Fund generally invests the following percentages
of its total assets in the indicated investment styles: <BR>

Investors should refer to the descriptions below of each of the
foregoing Equity Funds and the Small Company style for a discussion
of the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investments
and investment techniques of those styles and, accordingly, of
the portions of Growth Equity Fund invested using those styles.
The management of the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund's
four portfolio managers, including three who are also the portfolio
managers for corresponding Equity Funds. Three portfolio managers
jointly co-manage the assets allocated to the Small Company style.
The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a particular
investment style may be changed at any time by the Adviser in
response to market or other conditions. <BR>
<P>
<B>Contrarian Stock Fund</B> invests according to the basic premise
of the Adviser's &quot;contrarian&quot; investment approach: that
security prices change more than fundamental investment values
because consensus thinking often results in severe undervaluation
of securities whose immediate problems are obvious and whose longer
term prospects are, therefore, viewed too negatively. This consensus
pessimism can create investment opportunity. Consistent with this
underlying approach, the Adviser will purchase stocks whose prices
are temporarily depressed, either because they are out of favor
with, or simply ignored by, the investment community. <BR>
<P>
The basis of the Adviser's contrarian investment approach is the
comparison of the value and the price of a security. The Adviser
generally analyzes a security's value in terms of recovery earnings
and potential share price over a three-year investment time horizon.
Typically, stocks that the Adviser considers for purchase will
tend to have significantly depressed prices and relatively low
price to book value ratios. <BR>
<P>
The Fund's policy of investing in securities that may be temporarily
out of favor differs from the investment approach followed by
many other mutual funds with a similar investment objective. Such
mutual funds typically do not invest in securities that have declined
sharply in price, are not widely followed, or are issued by companies
that may have reported poor earnings or that may have suffered
a cyclical downturn in business. The Adviser believes, however,
that purchasing securities depressed by temporary factors may
provide investment returns superior to those obtained when premium
prices are paid for issues currently in favor. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may invest in preferred stock and securities convertible
into common stock and may invest up to 20 percent of its total
assets in foreign securities and in American Depository Receipts
and other similar securities of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment
Policies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment
Risks and Considerations.&quot; In addition, the Fund may invest
in fixed income securities that are rated, at the time of purchase,
within the three highest rating categories assigned by a nationally
recognized statistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors
Service, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Service L.P.,
or which are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variable
rates of interest. See &quot;Additional Investment Policies -
Fixed Income Securities and Their Characteristics.&quot; <BR>
<P>
<B>Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth Fund and the
Small Company style</B> each invest primarily in the common stock
of small and medium size domestic companies which have a market
capitalization well below that of the average company in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Market capitalization
refers to the total market value of a company's outstanding shares
of common stock. Small Company Stock Fund considers small and
medium companies as those whose market capitalizations are less
than $1 billion at the time of the Fund's purchase, although it
is anticipated that investments will be primarily in companies
with capitalizations of less than $750 million. Small Company
Growth Fund considers small and medium companies to be those with
market capitalizations less than $750 million at the time of the
Fund's purchase. <BR>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company
Growth Fund and the components of the other Funds that invest
in the Small Company style will invest at least 65 percent of
their total assets in common stock issued by small and medium
size companies. <BR>
<P>
In selecting securities for <B>Small Company Stock Fund</B>, the
Adviser seeks securities with significant price appreciation potential,
and attempts to identify companies that show above-average growth,
as compared to long-term overall market growth. The companies
in which the Fund invests may be in a relatively early stage of
development or may produce goods and services which have favorable
prospects for growth due to increasing demand or developing markets.
Frequently, such companies have a small management group and single
product or product line expertise that, in the view of the Adviser,
may result in an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit and greater focus
which may allow the firms to be successful. The Adviser believes
that such companies may develop into significant business enterprises
and that an investment in such companies offers a greater opportunity
for capital appreciation than an investment in larger more established
entities. Small companies frequently retain a large part of their
earnings for research, development and investment in capital assets,
however, so that the prospects for immediate dividend income are
limited. <BR>
<P>
Small Company Stock Fund may invest in preferred stock and securities
convertible into common stock and may invest up to 20 percent
of its total assets in foreign securities and in American Depository
Receipts, European Depository Receipts and other similar securities
of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment Policies - Equity Funds
- International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations.&quot;
In addition, the Fund may invest in fixed income securities of
small companies that are rated, at the time of purchase, within
the three highest rating categories assigned by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Service, L.P., or which
are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variable
rates of interest. See &quot;Additional Investment Policies -
Fixed Income Securities and Their Characteristics.&quot; <BR>
<P>
In selecting securities for <B>Small Company Growth Fund</B>,
the Adviser seeks to identify companies that are rapidly growing
(usually with relatively short operating histories) or that are
emerging from a period of investor neglect by undergoing a dramatic
change. These changes may involve a sharp increase in earnings,
the hiring of new management or measures taken to close the gap
between its share price and takeover/asset value. The Fund may
invest up to 10 percent of its total assets in foreign securities
and in American Depository Receipts and other similar securities
of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment Policies - Equity Funds
- International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations.&quot;
The Fund may not invest more than 10 percent of its total assets
in the securities of a single issuer. The Fund does not currently
invest in preferred stock and securities convertible into common
stock but reserves the right to do so in the future. <BR>
<P>
In selecting securities allocated to the <B>Small Company style</B>
component of Growth Equity Fund, Diversified Equity Fund and the
Balanced Funds, the Adviser uses the Small Company Stock Fund
style, the Small Company Growth Fund style and the Small Company
Value style, currently allocating 1/3 of its assets to each style.
<BR>
<P>
<I>Prior to December 11, 1995, the Small Company style did not
allocate any assets to the Small Company Value style. The allocation
of 1/3 of assets invested in the Small Company style to the Small
Company Value style is expected to be complete by June 1, 1996.
The Small Company style may in the future allocate its assets
to additional investment styles.</I> <BR>
<P>
In selecting portfolio investments, the Small Company Value style
focuses on securities that are conservatively valued in the marketplace
relative to their underlying fundamentals. Value investing provides
investors with a less aggressive way to take advantage of growth
opportunities of small companies. In investing in accordance with
this style, the Adviser will seek to invest in stocks priced low
relative to the stock of comparable companies, determined by price/earnings
ratios, cash flows or other measures. Value investing therefore
may reduce downside risk while offering potential for capital
appreciation as a stock gains favor among other investors and
its stock price rises. <BR>
<P>
<B>Small Company Investment Risks and Considerations.</B> The
companies in which Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth
Fund and the Small Company style components of the other Funds
invest may be in a relatively early stage of development or may
produce goods and services which have favorable prospects for
growth due to increasing demand or developing markets. Frequently,
such companies have a small management group and single product
or product line expertise. These characteristics may result in
an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit and greater focus which may
make those companies successful. The Adviser believes that such
companies may develop into significant business enterprises and
that an investment in such companies offers a greater opportunity
for capital appreciation than an investment in larger more established
entities. Small companies frequently retain a large part of their
earnings for research, development and investment in capital assets,
however, so that the prospects for immediate dividend income are
limited. <BR>
<P>
Investments in smaller companies generally involve greater risks
than investments in larger companies due to the small size of
the issuer and the fact that the issuer may have limited product
lines, access to financial markets and management depth. In addition,
many of the securities of smaller companies trade less frequently
and in lower volumes than securities issued by larger firms. The
result is that the short-term price volatility of small company
securities is greater than the short-term price volatility of
the securities of larger, more established companies that are
widely held. The securities of small companies may also be more
sensitive to market changes generally than the securities of large
companies. In addition, securities that are traded in the over-the-counter
market or on a regional securities exchange may not be traded
every day or in the volume typical of securities traded on a national
securities exchange. As a result, disposition of a portfolio security,
to meet redemptions by shareholders or otherwise, may require
a Fund to sell the security at a discount from market prices,
to sell during periods when disposition is not desirable, or to
make many small sales over an extended period. <BR>
<P>
While securities issued by smaller companies historically have
experienced greater market appreciation than the securities of
larger entities, there is no assurance that they will continue
to do so or that the Fund will be successful in identifying companies
whose securities will appreciate. <BR>
<P>
<B>Large Company Growth Fund</B> invests primarily in the common
stock of large, high-quality domestic companies that have superior
growth potential. Large companies are those whose market capitalizations
are at least $500 million at the time of the Fund's purchase and
whose equity trading volume would permit the sale or purchase
of a large position in the securities of the company in 2 or 3
trading days. Market capitalization refers to the total market
value of a company's outstanding shares of common stock. In selecting
securities for the Fund, the Adviser seeks issuers whose stock
is attractively valued and whose fundamental characteristics both
are significantly better than the market average and which support
internal earnings growth capability. The Fund's holdings may include
the securities of companies whose growth potential is, in the
Adviser's opinion, generally unrecognized or misperceived by the
market. In addition, the Fund may invest up to 20 percent of its
total assets in American Depository Receipts, European Depository
Receipts and other similar securities of large foreign issuers
and may attempt to reduce the overall risk of its foreign investments
by using foreign currency forward contracts. See &quot;Investment
Policies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment
Risks and Considerations.&quot; Under normal circumstances, the
Fund will not invest more than 10 percent of its total assets
in the securities of a single issuer. The Fund does not currently
invest in preferred stock or securities convertible into common
stock but reserves the right to do so in the future. <BR>
<P>
<B>International Fund</B> is designed for investors who desire
to achieve international diversification of their investments
by participating in foreign securities markets. Because international
investments generally involve risks in addition to those risks
associated with investments in the United States, the Fund should
be considered only as a vehicle for international diversification.
<BR>
<P>
As the Fund has the same investment policies as International
Portfolio and currently invests all of its assets in International
Portfolio, the following investment policies are discussed with
respect to International Portfolio only. International Portfolio
normally will invest substantially all of its assets in equity
securities of companies domiciled outside the United States. International
Portfolio selects its investments on the basis of their potential
for capital appreciation without regard to current income. The
Portfolio also may invest in the securities of closed-end investment
companies investing primarily in foreign securities and may invest
in debt obligations of foreign governments or their political
subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, and debt obligations
of supranational organizations and foreign corporations. Investment
will be diversified among securities of issuers in foreign countries
including, but not limited to, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. In
general, International Portfolio will invest only in securities
of companies and governments in countries that Schroder, in its
judgment, considers both politically and economically stable.
International Portfolio has no limit on the amount of its foreign
assets which may be invested in any one type of foreign instrument
or in any foreign country; however, to the extent International
Portfolio concentrates its assets in a foreign country, it will
incur greater risks. <BR>
<P>
International Portfolio may purchase preferred stock and securities
convertible into common stock, and may purchase American Depository
Receipts, European Depository Receipts or other similar securities
of foreign issuers. International Portfolio may also enter into
foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts to purchase
or sell foreign currencies, in anticipation of its currency requirements
and to protect against possible adverse movements in foreign exchange
rates. Although such contracts may reduce the risk of loss to
International Portfolio from adverse movements in currency values,
the contracts also limit possible gains from favorable movements.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations.</B> All investments,
domestic and foreign, involve certain risks. Investments in the
securities of foreign issuers may involve risks in addition to
those normally associated with investments in the securities of
U.S. issuers. All foreign investments are subject to risks of
foreign political and economic instability, adverse movements
in foreign exchange rates, the imposition or tightening of exchange
controls or other limitations on repatriation of foreign capital,
and changes in foreign governmental attitudes towards private
investment, possibly leading to nationalization, increased taxation
or confiscation of foreign investors' assets. <BR>
<P>
Moreover, dividends payable on foreign securities may be subject
to foreign withholding taxes, thereby reducing the income available
for distribution to International Portfolio's shareholders; commission
rates payable on foreign transactions are generally higher than
in the United States; foreign accounting, auditing and financial
reporting standards differ from those in the United States and,
accordingly, less information may be available about foreign companies
than is available about issuers of comparable securities in the
United States; and foreign securities may trade less frequently
and with lower volume and may exhibit greater price volatility
than U.S. securities. <BR>
<P>
Changes in foreign exchange rates will also affect the value in
U.S. dollars of all foreign currency-denominated securities held
by International Portfolio. Exchange rates are influenced generally
by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign currency markets
and by numerous other political and economic events occurring
outside the United States, many of which may be difficult, if
not impossible, to predict. <BR>
<P>
Income from foreign securities will be received and realized in
foreign currencies, and International Portfolio is required to
compute and distribute income in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, a
decline in the value of a particular foreign currency against
the U.S. dollar will reduce the dollars available to make a distribution.
Similarly, if the exchange rate declines between the time after
International Portfolio's income has been earned and computed
in U.S. dollars and the time it is paid may require International
Portfolio to liquidate portfolio securities to acquire sufficient
U.S. dollars to make a distribution. Similarly, if the exchange
rate declines between the time International Portfolio incurs
expenses in U.S. dollars and the time such expenses are paid,
International Portfolio may be required to liquidate additional
foreign securities to purchase the U.S. dollars required to meet
such expenses.<BR>
<P>
<B>Income Equity Fund</B> invests primarily in the common stock
of large, high-quality domestic companies that have above-average
return potential based on current market valuations. Primary emphasis
is placed on investing in securities of companies with above-average
dividend income. In selecting securities for the Fund, the Adviser
uses various valuation measures, including above-average dividend
yields and below industry average price to earnings, price to
book and price to sales ratios. The Fund considers large companies
to be those whose market capitalizations are at least $600 million
at the time of the Fund's purchase. Market capitalization refers
to the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of
common stock. The Fund may also invest in preferred stock and
securities convertible into common stock and may purchase American
Depository Receipts, European Depository Receipts and other similar
securities of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment Policies -
Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and
Considerations.&quot; Under normal circumstances, the Fund will
not invest more than 10 percent of its total assets in the securities
of a single issuer. <BR>
<P>
<B>Index Fund</B> is designed to duplicate the return of the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index (the &quot;Index&quot;)
with minimum tracking error, while also minimizing transaction
costs. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will hold stocks representing
96 percent or more of the capitalization-weighted market values
of the Index. Portfolio transactions for the Fund generally are
executed only to duplicate the composition of the Index, to invest
cash received from portfolio security dividends or shareholder
investments in the Fund, and to raise cash to fund Share redemptions.
The Fund may hold cash or cash equivalents for the purpose of
facilitating payment of the Fund's expenses or Share redemptions.
For these and other reasons, the Fund's performance can be expected
to approximate but not be equal to that of the Index. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may utilize index futures contracts to a limited extent.
Index futures contracts are bilateral agreements pursuant to which
two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash
equal to a specified dollar amount times the difference between
the index value at the close of trading of the contract and the
price at which the futures contract is originally struck. As no
physical delivery of securities comprising the index is made,
a purchaser of index futures contracts may participate in the
performance of the securities contained in the index without the
required capital commitment. Index futures contracts may be used
for several reasons: to simulate full investment in the underlying
index while retaining a cash balance for fund management purposes,
to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. For a description
of futures contracts and their risks see &quot;Appendix A: Investments,
Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations - Futures Contracts
and Options.&quot; <BR>
<P>
The Index tracks the total return performance of 500 common stocks
which are chosen for inclusion in the Index by Standard &amp;
Poor's (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) on a statistical basis. The inclusion
of a stock in the Index in no way implies that S&amp;P believes
the stock to be an attractive investment. The 500 securities,
most of which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, represent
approximately 70 percent of the total market value of all U.S.
common stocks. Each stock in the Index is weighted by its market
value. Because of the market-value weighting, the 50 largest companies
in the Index currently account for approximately 45 percent of
its value. The Index emphasizes large-capitalizations and, typically,
companies included in the Index are the largest and most dominant
firms in their respective industries. <BR>

The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by S&amp;P,
nor does S&amp;P make any representation or warranty, implied

public regarding the advisability of investing in index funds
or the ability of the Index to track general stock market performance.
S&amp;P does not guarantee the accuracy and/or the completeness
of the Index or any data included therein. S&amp;P makes no warranty,

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Balanced Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced
Fund and Growth Balanced Fund</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> each invest
in a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities.
Conservative Balanced Fund has the smallest equity securities
component of the three Funds and is the most conservative Balanced
Fund. Growth Balanced Fund has the largest equity securities component
of the three Balanced Funds and is the most aggressive of these
Funds. The equity portion of each Balanced Fund's portfolio uses
the five different equity investment styles of Diversified Equity
Fund. Diversified Equity Fund combines the different equity investment
styles of four of the Equity Funds - Large Company Growth Fund,
International Fund, Income Equity Fund and Index Fund - and investment
in a small company investment style (the &quot;Small Company style&quot;)
in order to reduce the risk of relying on a single equity investment
style. See &quot;Investment Policies - Equity Funds - Diversified
Equity Fund.&quot; The blending of different equity investment
styles is intended to reduce the price and return volatility of
the equity portion of the Balanced Funds. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fixed income portion of each Balanced Fund's
portfolio uses from three to five different fixed income investment
styles. Conservative Balanced Fund uses five fixed income investment
styles - the investment styles of Managed Fixed Income Fund, Total
Return Bond Fund and Stable Income Fund (the &quot;Managed Fixed
Income Fund style,&quot; the &quot;Total Return Bond Fund style&quot;
and the &quot;Stable Income Fund style,&quot; respectively), a
&quot;positive return&quot; investment style (the &quot;Positive
Return style&quot;) and a short maturity investment style (the
&quot;Short Maturity style&quot;). Moderate Balanced Fund uses
four fixed income investment styles - the Managed Fixed Income
Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund style, the Stable Income
Fund style and the Positive Return style. Growth Balanced Fund
uses three fixed income investment styles - the Managed Fixed
Income Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund style and the Positive
Return style. The blending of different fixed income investment
styles is intended to reduce the risk associated with relying
on a single fixed income investment style. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The base allocation among investment styles for each
Balanced Fund is set forth below. As market values of the Funds'
assets change, the percentage of Fund assets invested in any style
may temporarily deviate from the base allocations. In response
thereto, the Adviser will periodically effect transactions for
the Balanced Funds to reestablish their base allocations. In addition,
as the securities markets change, the Adviser may attempt to enhance
the returns of any of the Balanced Funds by changing, within certain
limits, the percentage of Fund assets invested in fixed income
and equity securities. The Adviser may, in its discretion, increase
or decrease the fixed income and equity percentages by up to 5
percent for Conservative Balanced Fund, 10 percent for Moderate
Balanced Fund and 15 percent for Growth Balanced Fund. For example,
the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund
style and the Positive Return style of Growth Balanced Fund, each
of which is used currently with respect to 11 2/3 percent of that
Fund's assets (a total of 35 percent), may each be increased to
16 2/3 percent (a total of 50 percent) or decreased to 6 2/3 percent
(a total of 20 percent) of that Fund's assets. In making these
changes, each Balanced Fund is required to limit its redemptions
to no more than 1 percent of a Blended Portfolio's net assets
during any period of less than thirty days. Absent unstable market
conditions, the Adviser does not anticipate making a substantial
number of percentage changes. When the Adviser believes a change
in the base allocation percentages is desirable, it will sell
and purchase securities to effect the change. When the Adviser
believes that a change will be temporary (generally, 3 years or
less), it may choose to effect the change by using futures contract
strategies as described below in &quot;Temporary Allocations.&quot;

Investors should refer to the descriptions of Diversified Equity

Fixed Income Fund and Total Return Bond Fund for a discussion
of the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investments
and investment techniques of those Funds which relate to the portions
of Growth Balanced Fund that are invested using their investment
styles. The investment policies related to the Positive Return
style are listed below. Management of the Fund's assets is divided
among the Fund's nine portfolio managers - the portfolio managers
of Diversified Equity Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund and Total
Return Bond Fund and the portfolio managers who manage assets
allocated to the Positive Return style. The percentage of a Fund's
assets invested using a particular investment style may be changed
at any time by the Adviser in response to market or other conditions.
<BR>
<P>
The <B>Positive Return style</B> seeks positive total return each
calendar year regardless of the bond market by investing in a
portfolio of U.S. Government and corporate fixed income investments.
The Adviser's investment with respect to assets invested in this
investment style are divided into two components, short bonds
with maturities of 2 years or less and long bonds with maturities
of 25 years or more. Shifts between short bonds and long bonds
are made based on movement in the prices of bonds rather than
on the Adviser's forecast of interest rates. During periods of
falling prices (generally, increasing interest rate environments)
long bonds are sold to protect capital and limit losses. Conversely,
when bond prices rise, long bonds are purchased. Accordingly,
the average maturity of the portfolio of securities invested in
the Positive Return style will vary. It is anticipated that under
normal circumstances the portfolio of securities invested in this
investment style will have an average dollar-weighted maturity
of between 1 and 30 years. <BR>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, at least 50 percent of the net assets
allocated to this style will be U.S. Government Securities, including
Treasury securities. All securities allocated to this style will
be, at the time of purchase, (i) rated in one of the two highest
long-term rating categories assigned by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Service, L.P. or (ii)
unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality.
No more than 25 percent may be in the second highest rating category.
Investments may include zero-coupon securities, securities with
variable or floating rates of interest and asset-backed securities,
but only 25 percent of the net assets allocated to this investment
style, in the aggregate, may be invested in these securities.
The Positive Return style may not invest in convertible securities,
mortgage pass-through securities or private placement securities.
Within these constraints, the Adviser purchases securities that
it believes have above-average yields. <BR>
<P>
The Short Maturity style seeks to provide a higher total return
than is generally available from money market funds. The assets
allocated to the Short Maturity style will be invested in a portfolio
of high-quality fixed and variable rate fixed income securities.
This investment style is managed to increase income and preserve
or enhance total return by actively managing average portfolio
maturity in light of market conditions and trends. Investments
may include a broad spectrum of short-term instruments of United
States and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securities,
and the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,
foreign governments, municipal governments, supranational organizations
and others. Investments are limited to instruments with a remaining
maturity of 5 years or less. With respect to assets allocated
to this style, the Fund will maintain a dollar-weighted average
portfolio maturity of 1 year or less and, under normal circumstances,
will maintain 50 percent of the assets in instruments with a maturity
of under 1 year. Up to 25 percent of the assets may be non-U.S.
dollar denominated and, with respect to those assets, the Adviser
will attempt to hedge currency fluctuation risk. Investments may
include mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities,
limited to not more than 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
of the assets allocated to this investment style. The Fund may
enter into &quot;dollar roll&quot; transactions related to these
investments and may purchase stripped mortgage-backed securities.
The Fund may invest up to 10 percent of its assets allocated to
the style in guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance
companies. The securities allocated to the style may have variable
or floating rates of interest or principal and may include participation
interests and Municipal Securities. Municipal Securities include
obligations of the states, territories or possessions of the United
States and their subdivisions, authorities and corporations. 
<BR>
<P>
All securities allocated to the Short Maturity style will be,
at the time of purchase, (i) rated in one of the two highest short-term
rating categories by two Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations (&quot;NRSROs&quot;) (or, if only one NRSRO has
issued a rating, by that NRSRO), (ii) rated in one of the three
highest long-term rating categories by two NRSROs (or, if only
one NRSRO has issued a rating, by that NRSRO), or (iii) unrated
and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. Of
the securities allocated to this style, no more than 5 percent
may be in any of the lowest permissible rating categories. <BR>
<P>
In order to manage its exposure to different types of investments,
when investing in this style the Adviser may enter into interest
rate, currency and mortgage swap agreements and may purchase and
sell interest rate caps, floors and collars. With respect to assets
invested in this style, the Adviser may also engage in certain
strategies involving options (both exchange-traded and over-the-counter)
to attempt to enhance the return on assets invested in this style
and may attempt to reduce the overall risk of those assets or
limit the uncertainty in the level of future foreign exchange
rates (hedge) by using options and futures contracts and foreign
currency forward contracts. The Adviser's ability to use these
strategies with respect to this style may be limited by market
considerations, regulatory limits and tax considerations. In investing
in accordance with this style, the Adviser may write covered call
and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interest
rate and foreign currency futures contracts and buy options and
write covered options on those futures contracts. An option is
covered if, so long as the respective Fund is obligated under
the option, it owns an offsetting position in the underlying security
or futures contract or maintains a segregated account of liquid,
high-grade debt instruments with a value at all times sufficient
to cover the Fund's obligations under the option.<BR>
<P>
<B>Temporary Allocations</B>. In its discretion, the Adviser may
increase or decrease the percentage of assets of each Balanced
Fund that are invested in fixed income and equity securities.
When the Adviser believes that a percentage reallocation will
be of short duration (generally, up to 3 years), the Adviser may
determine to achieve the economic equivalent of a reallocation
without incurring securities transaction costs by using futures
contracts rather than selling and purchasing securities. Under
this strategy, to the extent of the percentage asset allocation
change, the Fund would not be invested in nor subject to the risks
related to the types of individual securities purchased in accordance
with the various investment styles used by the Fund. Rather, the
Fund would be invested in and subject to the risks related to
futures contracts. For a description of futures contracts and
their risks, see &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategies
and Risk Considerations - Futures Contracts and Options.&quot;

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Intermediate U.S. Government Fund</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
seeks to attain its investment objective by investing primarily
in fixed and variable rate U.S. Government Securities. Under normal
circumstances, the Fund intends to invest at least 65 percent
of its assets in U.S. Government Securities and may invest up
to 35 percent of its assets in fixed income securities that are
not U.S. Government Securities. The Fund emphasizes the use of
intermediate maturity securities to lessen interest rate risk,
while employing low risk yield enhancement techniques to add to
the Fund's return over a complete economic or interest rate cycle,
such as adjustable rate securities and swap agreements. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The securities in which the Fund invests will include
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, although the
Fund will limit these investments to not more than 50 percent
and 25 percent, respectively, of its total assets. As part of
its mortgage-backed securities investments, the Fund may enter
into &quot;dollar roll&quot; transactions. Certain fixed income
securities are &quot;zero-coupon&quot; securities and the Fund
will limit its investment in these securities, except those issued
through the U.S. Treasury's STRIPS program, to not more than 10
percent of the Fund's total assets. The Fund may also invest in
securities that are restricted as to disposition under the Federal
securities laws (sometimes referred to as &quot;private placements&quot;
or &quot;restricted securities&quot;). In addition, the Fund may
not invest more than 25 percent of its total assets in securities
issued or guaranteed by any single agency or instrumentality of
the U.S. Government, except the U.S. Treasury. The Fund may make
short sales and may purchase securities on margin (borrow money
in order to purchase securities), which are considered speculative
investment techniques. See &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment
Strategies and Risk Considerations - Short Sales&quot; and &quot;-
Purchasing Securities on Margin.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Fund primarily will invest in debt obligations
with maturities (or average life in the case of mortgage-backed
and similar securities) ranging from short-term (including overnight)
to 12 years. Under normal circumstances, the Fund's portfolio
of securities will have an average dollar-weighted maturity of
between 3 and 7 years. Under normal circumstances, the Fund's
portfolio of securities will have a duration of between 75 percent
and 125 percent of the duration of the Lehman Intermediate Government
Bond Index, which is used as the Fund's benchmark index as described
under &quot;Other Information - Fund Performance.&quot; Duration
is a measure of a debt security's average life that reflects the
present value of the security's cash flow and, accordingly, is
a measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes (&quot;duration
risk&quot;). Because earlier payments on a debt security have
a higher present value, duration of a security, except a zero-coupon
security, will be less than the security's stated maturity. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>In order to manage its exposure to different types

to attempt to enhance the Fund's return and may attempt to reduce
the overall risk of its investments (&quot;hedge&quot;) by using
options and futures contracts. The Fund's ability to use these
strategies may be limited by market considerations, regulatory
limits and tax considerations. The Fund may write covered call
and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interest
rate futures contracts, and buy options and write covered options
on those futures contracts. An option is covered if, so long as
the Fund is obligated under the option, it owns an offsetting
position in the underlying security or futures contract or maintains
a segregated account of liquid, high-grade debt instruments with
a value at all times sufficient to cover the Fund's obligations
under the option. <BR>

States and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securities
and the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,
and others. The Fund emphasizes the use of intermediate maturity
securities to lessen duration risk (as described below), while
employing low risk yield enhancement techniques to add to the
Fund's return over a complete economic or interest rate cycle.
Intermediate term obligations comprise securities with maturities
of between 2 and 20 years. <BR>

a higher present value, duration of a security, except a zero-coupon
security, is less than the security's stated maturity. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In order to manage its exposure to different types
of investments, the Fund may enter into interest rate and mortgage
swap agreements and may purchase and sell interest rate caps,
floors and collars. The Fund may also engage in certain strategies
involving options (both exchange-traded and over-the-counter)
to attempt to enhance the Fund's return and may attempt to reduce
the overall risk of its investments (&quot;hedge&quot;) by using
options and futures contracts. The Fund's ability to use these
strategies may be limited by market considerations, regulatory
limits and tax considerations. The Fund may write covered call
and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interest
rate futures contracts and buy options and write covered options
on those futures contracts. An option is covered if, so long as
the Fund is obligated under the option, it owns an offsetting
position in the underlying security or futures contract or maintains
a segregated account of liquid, high-grade debt instruments with
a value at all times sufficient to cover the Fund's obligations
under the option. <BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Effective April 1, 1996 the Fund will employ two
investment styles - the Total Return style and the Positive Return
style - in addition to the investment style currently employed
by the Fund (the &quot;Managed Fixed Income Fund style&quot;)
to the extent consistent with the Fund's investment objective
and policies. In addition, to more appropriately reflect the utilization
of three distinct investment styles in pursuit of the Fund's investment
objective, effective April 1, 1996 the Fund will be renamed &quot;Diversified
Bond Fund.&quot; Under the Fund's new &quot;multi-style&quot;
approach, the Fund generally will invest the following percentages
of its total assets in accordance with the indicated investment
styles: <BR>

<BR>
<P>
<I>Each of the two new investment styles, based on disparate investment
criteria, tends to invest in debt obligations with either shorter
or longer maturities than the Fund's current investment style.
Reliance on multiple investment styles is intended to reduce the
price and return volatility of the Fund and provide more consistent
fixed income returns. For a description of each of the Total Return
Bond style and the Positive Return style, see &quot;Investment
Policies - Balanced Funds.&quot; <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Total Return Bond Fund</B> invests primarily in U.S. Government
Securities, including mortgage-backed securities, and investment
grade corporate fixed income securities. The Adviser's investment
decisions are based on its analysis of major changes in the direction
of interest rates rather than on attempts by the Adviser to predict
short-term interest rate fluctuations. The Adviser also applies
a contrarian perspective by looking for undervalued segments of
the fixed income market which the Adviser believes offer opportunities
for increased returns. <BR>
<P>
In making its investment decisions for the Fund, the Adviser focuses
on the maturity structure and quality structure of the Fund's
portfolio. When the Adviser's outlook is for rising interest rates
and falling bond values, the majority of the Fund's portfolio
will be invested in securities with short-term maturities in an
effort to ride interest rates up while minimizing the negative
effect of falling bond prices. When the Adviser anticipates interest
rates to fall and bond prices to increase, the Fund generally
will be invested in securities with long-term maturities in an
attempt to lock in high interest rates and capitalize on bond
price appreciation. Accordingly, the average maturity of the Fund's
portfolio will vary from 1 to 30 years. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may invest an unlimited amount of its assets in either
corporate securities, including corporate bonds, debentures and
notes, or U.S. Government Securities. The Fund will be invested
to a greater degree in corporate securities, however, as the spread
between corporate and U.S. Government Securities offers potential
for incremental returns. The Fund limits its investments in variable
or floating rate securities to 5 percent of its net assets. The
Fund does not currently invest in mortgage-backed securities or
enter &quot;dollar roll&quot; transactions, but reserves the right
to do so in the future. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and securities convertible
into common stock, but may not own the common stock into which
a convertible security converts. The Fund will only purchase securities
(including convertible securities) that are rated, at the time
of purchase, within the four highest long-term or two highest
short-term rating categories assigned by a nationally-recognized
statistical rating organization, such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Services, L.P., or which
are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. <BR>
<P>
<B>Stable Income Fund</B> seeks to maintain safety of principal
while providing low volatility total return by investing primarily
in investment grade short-term obligations. The Fund invests in
a diversified portfolio of fixed and variable rate U.S. dollar
denominated fixed income securities of a broad spectrum of United
States and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securities
and the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,
and others. <BR>
<P>
The securities in which the Fund invests include mortgage-backed
and other asset-backed securities, although the Fund limits these
investments to not more than 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
of its total assets. In addition, the Fund limits its holdings
of mortgage-backed securities that are not U.S. Government Securities
to 25 percent of its total assets. The Fund may invest any amount
of its assets in U.S. Government Securities, but under normal
circumstances less than 50 percent of the Fund's total assets
are so invested. The Fund may invest in securities that are restricted
as to disposition under the Federal securities laws (sometimes
referred to as &quot;private placements&quot; or &quot;restricted
securities&quot;). In addition, the Fund may not invest more than
25 percent of its total assets in the securities issued or guaranteed
by any single agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government,
except the U.S. Treasury, and may not invest more than 10 percent
of its total assets in the securities of any other issuer. <BR>
<P>
The Fund only purchases those securities that are rated, at the
time of purchase, within the three highest long-term or two highest
short-term rating categories assigned by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization, such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's or Fitch Investors Services, L.P., or which
are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. See &quot;Additional Investment Policies - Rating Matters&quot;
below. <BR>
<P>
The Fund invests in debt obligations with maturities (or average
life in the case of mortgage-backed and similar securities) ranging
from short-term (including overnight) to 12 years and seeks to
maintain an average dollar-weighted portfolio maturity of between
2 and 5 years. <BR>
<P>
In order to manage its exposure to different types of investments,
the Fund may enter into interest rate and mortgage swap agreements
and may purchase and sell interest rate caps, floors and collars.
The Fund may also engage in certain strategies involving options
(both exchange-traded and over-the-counter) to attempt to enhance
the Fund's income and may attempt to reduce the overall risk of
its investments or limit the uncertainty in the level of future
foreign exchange rates (hedge) by using options and futures contracts
and foreign currency forward contracts. The Fund's ability to
use these strategies may be limited by market considerations,
regulatory limits and tax considerations. The Fund may write covered
call and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interest
rate and foreign currency futures contracts and buy options and
write covered options on those futures contracts. An option is
covered if, so long as the Fund is obligated under the option,
it owns an offsetting position in the underlying security or futures
contract or maintains a segregated account of liquid, high-grade
debt instruments with a value at all times sufficient to cover
the Fund's obligations under the option. <BR>
<P>
<B>Ready Cash Investment Fund</B> invests in a broad spectrum
of high-quality, short-term money market instruments of United
States and foreign issuers that are determined by the Adviser,
pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board, to be eligible for
purchase and to present minimal credit risks. These instruments
may be U.S. Government Securities or the securities of financial
institutions, corporations, foreign governments, municipal governments,
supranational organizations and others. The Fund may invest only
in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments that have a remaining maturity
of 397 days or less (as calculated pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940) and will maintain a dollar-weighted
average portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. The Fund may purchase
securities with ultimate maturities of greater than 397 days only
in accordance with Rule 2a-7. Under that Rule, only those long-term
instruments that have demand features which comply with certain
requirements and certain variable rate U.S. Government Securities
may be purchased. <BR>
<P>
The Fund normally will invest more than 25% of its total assets
in the obligations of domestic and foreign financial institutions,
their holding companies, and their subsidiaries. This concentration
may result in increased exposure to risks pertaining to the banking
industry. These risks include a sustained increase in interest
rates, which can adversely affect the availability and cost of
a bank's lending activities; exposure to credit losses during
times of economic decline; concentration of loan portfolios in
certain industries; regulatory developments; and competition among
financial institutions. The Fund may not invest more than 25%
of its total assets in any other single industry. <BR>
<P>
The securities in which the Fund invests will include mortgage-related
securities, asset-backed securities and participation interests
and may have variable or floating rates of interest or principal.
Except to the limited extent permitted by Rule 2a-7 and except
for U.S. Government Securities, the Fund will not invest more
than 5 percent of its total assets in the securities of any one
issuer. Also, the Fund may not purchase a security if the value
of all securities held by the Fund and issued or guaranteed by
the same issuer (including letters of credit in support of a security)
would exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. In addition, to ensure
adequate liquidity, the Fund may not invest more than 10 percent
of its net assets in illiquid securities. Under the supervision
of the Board, the Adviser determines and monitors the liquidity
of portfolio securities. <BR>
<P>
High-quality instruments include those that (i) are rated (or,
if unrated, are issued by an issuer with comparable outstanding
short-term debt that is rated) in one of the two highest rating
categories by two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(&quot;NRSROs&quot;) or, if only one NRSRO has issued a rating,
by that NRSRO or (ii) are otherwise unrated and determined by
the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund will invest
at least 95 percent of its total assets in securities in the highest
rating category (as determined pursuant to Rule 2a-7). <BR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT POLICIES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All investment policies of a Fund that are designated
as fundamental, and each Fund's investment objective, may not
be changed without approval of the holders of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities. A majority of a Fund's outstanding
voting securities means the lesser of 67 percent of the shares
of the Fund present or represented at a shareholders' meeting
at which the holders of more than 50 percent of the shares are
present or represented, or more than 50 percent of the outstanding
shares of the Fund. Except as otherwise indicated, investment
policies of the Funds are not fundamental and may be changed by
the Board without shareholder approval.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Investment Limitations.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
The Funds have adopted the investment limitations listed below,
each of which is a nonfundamental policy except as noted. These
policies relate to each Fund and, unless otherwise noted, not
to a portion of a Fund invested in a particular investment style.
Other investment limitations, including additional provisions
with respect to the limitations listed below, are described in
the SAI. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Diversification</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>. Each
Fund is a &quot;diversified&quot; portfolio as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;).
As a fundamental policy, with respect to 75 percent of its assets,
no Fund may purchase a security (other than a U.S. Government
Security) if, as a result, (i) more than 5 percent of the Fund's
total assets would be invested in the securities of a single issuer
or (ii) the Fund would own more than 10 percent of the outstanding
voting securities of any single issuer. International Fund may
invest up to 100 percent of its investment assets in the International
Portfolio and each other Fund (except Ready Cash Investment Fund)
reserves the right to invest all or a portion of its assets in
another diversified, open-end investment company with substantially
the same investment objective and policies as the Fund. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Concentration.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> Except
as noted below, each of the Funds is prohibited from concentrating
its assets in the securities of issuers in any industry. As a
fundamental policy, no Fund may purchase securities if, immediately
after the purchase, more than 25 percent of the value of the Fund's
total assets would be invested in the securities of issuers conducting
their principal business activities in the same industry. This
limit does not apply to investments in U.S. Government Securities,
foreign government securities, repurchase agreements covering
U.S. Government Securities or investment company securities. It
is currently anticipated that the Funds will not concentrate in
securities issued by any single foreign government. Under normal
circumstances, Ready Cash Investment Fund will invest more than
25 percent of its total assets in the obligations of domestic
and foreign financial institutions and their holding companies.
This concentration may result in increased exposure to risks pertaining
to the financial institution industry. These risks include a sustained
increase in interest rates, which can adversely affect the availability
and cost of a bank's lending activities; exposure to credit losses
during times of economic decline; concentration of loan portfolios
in certain industries; regulatory developments; and competition
among financial institutions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Illiquid Securities.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> Each
of the Funds limits its purchase of illiquid securities. No Fund
may knowingly acquire securities or invest in repurchase agreements
with respect to any securities if, as a result, more than 15 percent
(10 percent for Ready Cash Investment Fund) of the Fund's net
assets taken at current value would be invested in securities
which are not readily marketable. Illiquid investments include
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">securities that are illiquid
by virtue of legal or contractual restrictions on the sale of
such securities and repurchase agreements not entitling the holder
to principal within 7 days. Under the supervision of the Board,
the Advisers determine and monitor the liquidity of portfolio
securities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Borrowing and Lending. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As
a fundamental policy, each Fund may borrow money for temporary
or emergency purposes, including the meeting of redemption requests,
but not in excess of 33 1/3 percent of the value of the Fund's
total assets as computed immediately after the borrowing. Borrowing
for other than temporary or emergency purposes or meeting redemption
requests is limited to 5 percent of the value of each Fund's total
assets except in the case of Intermediate U.S. Government Fund,
Man-aged Fixed Income Fund and, with respect to their assets invested
in the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Balanced Funds. When
a Fund establishes a segregated account to limit the amount of
leveraging of the Fund with respect to certain investment techniques,
the Fund does not treat those techniques as involving borrowings
(although they may have characteristics and risks similar to borrowings
and result in the Fund's assets being leveraged). See &quot;Appendix
A: Investments, Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations
- Borrowing&quot; and &quot;Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot;
As a fundamental policy, no Fund may make loans except for loans
of portfolio securities, through the use of repurchase agreements,
and through the purchase of debt securities that are otherwise
permitted in-vestments for the Fund.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Margin and Short Sales. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Except
for Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, no Fund may purchase securities
on margin or make short sales of securities, except short sales
against the box. These prohibitions do not restrict the Funds'
ability to use short-term credits necessary for the clearance
of port-folio transactions and to make margin deposits in connection
with permitted transactions in options and futures contracts.

</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Temporary Defensive Position.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">When business or financial
conditions warrant, each Fund may assume a temporary defensive
position and invest all or any portion of their assets in cash
or in cash equivalents, including (i) short-term U.S. Government
Securities, (ii) prime quality short-term instruments of commercial
banks, (iii) prime quality commercial paper, (iv) repurchase agreements
with banks and broker-dealers covering any of the securities in
which the Fund may invest directly and (v) shares of money market
mutual funds. During periods when and to the extent that a Fund
has assumed a temporary defensive position, it may not be pursuing
its investment objective. The Funds may from time to time maintain
investments in cash and cash equivalents pending investment in
securities. The International Portfolio and, with respect to the
portion of their assets managed by Schroder, Diversified Equity
Fund, Growth Equity Fund and each Balanced Fund, may hold cash
and bank instruments denominated in any major foreign currency.
Prime quality refers to the two highest short-term ratings of
a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.<BR>

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each of the Funds may
enter into repurchase agreements (for reasons other than temporary
defensive purposes) and reverse repurchase agreements, may lend
their portfolio securities and may purchase portfolio securities
on a when-issued or forward commitment basis. It is currently
anticipated that the Equity Funds will not enter into reverse
repurchase agreements or purchase portfolio securities on a when-issued
or forward commitment basis to any significant extent.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Fixed Income Securities and
Their Characteristics. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Although
each Fund only invests in investment grade fixed income securities,
including money market instruments, an investment in a Fund is
subject to risk even if all fixed income securities in the Fund's
portfolio are paid in full at maturity. All fixed income securities,
including U.S. Government Securities, can change in value when
there is a change in interest rates or the issuer's actual or
perceived creditworthiness or ability to meet its obligations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The market value of the interest-bearing
debt securities held by the Funds will be affected by changes
in interest rates. There is normally an inverse relationship between
the market value of securities sensitive to prevailing interest
rates and actual changes in interest rates. In other words, an
increase in interest rates produces a decrease in market value.
Moreover, the longer the remaining maturity of a security, the
greater will be the effect of interest rate changes on the market
value of that security. Changes in the ability of an issuer to
make payments of interest and principal and in the market's</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">perception of an issuer's
creditworthiness will also affect the market value of the debt
securities of that issuer. The possibility exists, therefore,
that, the ability of any issuer to pay, when due, the principal
of and interest on its debt securities may become impaired.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Fixed income securities include
those issued by the governments of foreign countries or by those
countries' political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities
as well as by supranational organizations such as the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. To the extent otherwise
permitted, the Funds may invest in these securities if the Adviser
or Schroder believes that the securities do not present risks
inconsistent with a Fund's investment objective.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Rating Matters. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The
Fixed Income Funds and, with respect to their assets invested
in fixed income investment styles, the Balanced Funds will invest
in securities rated in the categories specified by their investment
policies. The Funds also may purchase unrated securities if the
Adviser determines the security to be of comparable quality to
a rated security that the Fund may purchase. Unrated securities
may not be as actively traded as rated securities. Each Fund may
retain a security whose rating has been lowered below the Fund's
lowest permissible rating category (or that are unrated and determined
by the Adviser to be of comparable quality to securities whose
rating has been lowered below the Fund's lowest permissible rating
category) if the Adviser or Schroder, as appropriate, determines
that retaining the security is in the best interests of the Fund.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Fund's investments are subject
to &quot;credit risk&quot; relating to the financial condition
of the issuers of the securities that the Funds hold. To limit
credit risk, the Funds (other than Ready Cash Investment Fund)
may only invest in securities that are investment grade - rated
in the top four long-term investment grades by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization (&quot;NRSRO&quot;) or in the
top two short-term investment grades by an NRSRO. Accordingly,
the lowest permissible long-term investment grades for corporate
bonds, including convertible bonds, are Baa in the case of Moody's
Investor Service (&quot;Moody's&quot;) and BBB in the case of
Standard &amp; Poor's (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) and Fitch Investors
Service, L.P. (&quot;Fitch&quot;); the lowest permissible long-term
investment grades for preferred stock are Baa in the case of Moody's
and BBB in the case of S&amp;P and Fitch; and the lowest permissible
short-term investment grades for short-term debt, including commercial
paper, are Prime-2 (P-2) in the case of Moody's, A-2 in the case
of S&amp;P and F-2 in the case of Fitch. A further description
of the rating categories of certain NRSROs is contained in the
SAI. All these ratings are generally considered to be investment
grade ratings, although Moody's indicates that securities with
long-term ratings of Baa have speculative characteristics. As
a money market fund, Ready Cash Investment Fund has separate rating
restrictions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Variable and Floating Rate Securities.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The securities in which
the Funds invest may have variable or floating rates of interest
and, under certain limited circumstances, may have varying principal
amounts. These securities pay interest at rates that are adjusted
periodically according to a specified formula, usually with reference
to some interest rate index or market interest rate (the &quot;underlying
index&quot;). The interest paid on these securities is a function
primarily of the underlying index upon which the interest rate
adjustments are based. Such adjustments minimize changes in the
market value of the obligation and, accordingly, enhance the ability
of the Fund to maintain a stable net asset value. Similarly to
fixed rate debt instruments, variable and floating rate instruments
are subject to changes in value based on changes in market interest
rates or changes in the issuer's creditworthiness. The rate of
interest on securities purchased by a Fund may be tied to Treasury
or other government securities or indices on those securities
as well as any other rate of interest or index. Certain variable
rate securities(including mortgage-backed securities) pay interest
at a rate that varies inversely to prevailing short-term interest
rates (sometimes referred to as inverse floaters). For example,
upon reset the interest rate payable on a security may go down
when the underlying index has risen. During periods when short-term
interest rates are relatively low as compared to long-term interest
rates, a Fund may attempt to enhance its yield by purchasing inverse
floaters. Certain inverse floaters may have an interest rate reset
mechanism that multiplies the effects of changes in the underlying
index. While this form of leverage may increase the security's,
and thus the Fund's, yield, it may also increase the volatility
of the security's market value.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">There may not be an active secondary
market for any particular floating or variable rate instrument;
this could make it difficult for a Fund to dispose of the instrument
during periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty or
if the issuer's credit became impaired at a time when the Fund
was not entitled to exercise any demand rights it might have.
A Fund could, for this or other reasons, suffer a loss with respect
to the instrument. The Advisers monitor the liquidity of the Funds'
investments invariable and floating rate instruments, but there
can be no guarantee that an active secondary market will exist
at any time. Ready Cash Investment Fund also may purchase variable
and floating rate demand notes which are unsecured obligations
redeemable upon not more than 30 days' notice. These obligations
include master demand notes that permit investment of fluctuating
amounts at varying rates of interest pursuant to direct arrangement
with the issuer of the instrument. The issuer of these obligations
often has the right, after a given period, to prepay their outstanding
principal amount of the obligations upon a specified number of
days' notice. These obligations generally are not traded, nor
generally is there an established secondary market for these obligations.
To the extent a demand note does not have a seven day or shorter
demand feature and there is no readily available market for the
obligation, it is treated as an illiquid security.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Certain securities may have an
initial principal amount that varies over time based on an interest
rate index, and, accordingly, a Fund might be entitled to less
than the initial principal amount of the security upon the security's
maturity. The Funds intend to purchase these securities only when
the Adviser believes the interest income from the instrument justifies
any principal risks associated with the instrument. The Advisers
may attempt to limit any potential loss of principal by purchasing
similar instruments that are intended to provide an offsetting
increase in principal. There can be no assurance that an Adviser
will be able to limit the effects of principal fluctuations and,
accordingly, a Fund may incur losses on those securities even
if held to maturity without issuer default.<BR>
