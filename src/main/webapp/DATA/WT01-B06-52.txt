<STRONG>Computer Basics for Investing and Portfolio Management - Part II</STRONG><BR>
By John Bajkowski<P>

In today's fast-paced investment world, people are increasingly turning toward computers for assistance in the investment decision process. Part 1 of this series examined how computers can help users with basic recordkeeping, budgeting, financial planning and portfolio management. This article will explore the avenues of actually putting a computer to work locating and analyzing stocks through fundamental and technical analysis. <P>

<HR>
<STRONG>Fundamental Screening</STRONG><P>


Fundamental analysis refers to the process of selecting stocks based upon underlying economic trends and long-term expectations of future company performance. The crucial variable in fundamental analysis revolves around projected growth in factors such as sales, cash flow, earnings and dividends. Software for fundamental analysis is usually broken down into two categories - screening and valuation. Screening refers to the act of searching through a large universe of securities to locate a few that might hold promise and warrant further analysis. Valuation, on the other hand, refers to taking one company and applying a series of valuation models to determine if the current price can be considered fair. <P>


Screening should be familiar to readers of the AAII Journal's Shadow Stock articles. It was the availability of economical electronic databases that first allowed AAII to come up with the Shadow Stock list and allows us to apply and test various screening techniques on a continuing basis. The Shadow Stock series also highlights the limitations of fundamental screening - even after a screen is applied and the list of stocks is narrowed down, further analysis is required. Screening represents only the first step in locating potentially attractive companies. <P>


Screening dictates that the search process starts with a broad universe of companies. It is not practical to enter this data by hand, so investors must either acquire the complete database and store it on their computer for screening or dial up to another computer and have it perform the screen and return only the results of the screen. <P>


In comparing stock screening services, critical factors include: the universe of stocks supported by the database, the depth of stock information, the flexibility of screening software, the frequency of updates, distribution methods, computer system support, and price. The screening services listed in the table following this article vary widely in the number of stocks tracked, from the 1,600 stocks tracked by Value Line to the 7,500 NYSE, Amex, Nasdaq National Market, and Nasdaq Small Cap listed stocks found in AAII's Stock Investor. When contemplating a data vendor, consider the types of companies that you are trying to find. If your focus is only on larger, more established companies, then Value Line's 1,600 company coverage may not be a limitation. However, if you are seeking smaller, less-followed firms, look for a service that covers a wider range of stocks. <P>


Screening services vary in the depth of stock information they provide. Some services, such as Smart Investor/WealthBuilder and Value/Screen III, provide a fewer number of variables for each company and depend more on summary statistics such as growth rates when providing background data. Other services, such as MarketBase and Stock Investor, provide both summary statistics and the raw year-by-year or quarterly data behind these numbers. In considering a data service, look not only at the number of variables but also specifically at which statistics are provided. Value/Screen III allows you to screen companies based upon Value Line's rankings and projected growth rates, which may be more important for some investors than a complete database. Telescan's ProSearch program is the only service that combines both fundamental and technical factors for screening. Before settling on a service, obtain a listing of available screening variables to determine if the program will support those variables you find important. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>Software Flexibility</STRONG><P>


The next consideration in selecting a screening service is the flexibility of the screening software. Screening services that distribute a complete database to the user and then allow you to manipulate the data tend to offer more flexibility than strictly dial-up services. For example, products such as MarketBase, Stock Investor and Value/Screen III allow users to combine existing fields to create custom variables. Look for flexibility in creating screening criteria. <P>


The method of data updating may play a role in selecting a vendor. Smart Investor/WealthBuilder or Value/Screen III, give you the option of updating your complete database either by mailed diskettes or by downloading the data via phone lines. Other services, such as Stock Investor, only offer diskette updates via mail. The pure on-line vendors will always require a phone call to perform a screen. Screening or downloading a complete database via phone lines may add significantly to the cost of operating the program, depending on telephone charges. <P>


The frequency of the data updates must also be considered. On-line services typically update their database on a daily or weekly basis. If the complete database resides on your computer, then you must select a delivery schedule, which will determine the annual cost. Options vary from weekly updates to annual updates. Expect to pay anywhere from $100 to over $2,000 per year, depending upon how frequently you update and who supplies the data. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>On-Line vs. Disks</STRONG><P>


For investors who plan to perform screens infrequently or can limit their analysis to after-hours access, on-line services offer a good alternative to disk-based services. With these on-line services, you do not acquire the complete database. Instead, using your computer, you dial up to another computer that contains the database, input the screening criteria and retrieve the list of companies that pass the screen, along with some of their financial data. Investors using a dial-up screening service have the advantage of being able to access a large universe at the start of the screening process, using up-to-date data. In return for this, users may give up some of the detailed company information provided by the complete database vendors and the ability to create custom variables. Infrequent users can opt for a pay-as-you-go option in which you typically pay for initiating the screening process, pay a unit fee for each company that passed the screen, and pay for the per-minute connect fees that the on-line services charge. Under such a situation expect to pay between $5 to $20 per screening session. Alternatively, more of the on-line services are offering a flat-rate option in which users pay a standard monthly charge for unlimited access. Prodigy offers Strategic Investor for $15 per month, which allows unlimited access to stock and mutual databases with wide security coverage. Limited custom screening, however, is a weakness with this service. Telescan ProSearch offers a good balance of wide company coverage, a variety of screening variables, flexible screening options, and integrated software. Telescan also offers a variety of pricing options ranging from a pay-as-you-use option to unlimited screening with different prices for prime-time or non-prime-time access. <P>


Before settling on a screening system, make sure that the service is adequate in terms of the number of companies covered and the type of data provided for each company. Also look at the flexibility of the screening program, with an eye toward being able to apply those criteria that interest you. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>Fundamental Valuation</STRONG><P>


Computers are well-suited to fundamental screening, but weak when it comes to assisting in fundamental valuation. This is because so much of the valuation rests on your personal growth forecasts for the economy, a company's industry, and the company itself. There are, however, a few programs that can assist investors with fundamental stock valuation. At one end of the spectrum are the macroeconomic forecasting programs that make overall economic projections that, in turn, drive fundamental valuation models analyzing individual companies. Macro*World Investor is typical of these programs. It costs $899.95 and requires frequent data updates, which cost $39/month after the first year. But even at that price, any valuation produced by such a product requires careful analysis by the user. <P>


At the other end of the spectrum are the programs that have compiled a series of valuation models that examine factors such as price-earnings ratios, dividend yields, earnings and sales growth rates and apply models such as the dividend discount or relative price-earnings ratio model. Entering the appropriate historical information along with your projected growth rates will enable these programs to return valuation estimates. These programs are typically spreadsheet templates originally designed to run in programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Excel, and some of the programs require that you own a compatible spreadsheet. Other products, such as FinVal, have been converted to run all by themselves, but most require that the user have a working knowledge of spreadsheet operation to make use of the program. In selecting and using these programs, remember that it is your judgment that drives the valuation. They can, however, provide you with a consistent framework in which to do an analysis. Look at the valuation models supplied by the programs along with the ease of operation and data entry. <P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Technical Analysis</STRONG><P>


Technical analysis covers a variety of techniques that study relationships between a stock's past price and volume movements and patterns to forecast security and market price direction. Typically, these patterns are charted. Technical analysis is well-suited to computerization. It involves the manipulation of a large amount of data. Technical analysis software allows investors to quickly obtain data and plot it, applying various technical indicators such as moving averages. The better programs also allow investors to test the success of various strategies on historical data (backtesting). What once would have taken many hours, if not days, can now be accomplished in minutes. <P>
 

Technical analysis programs require a great deal of price and volume data, which makes manual data entry tedious and error-prone. When selecting a program, closely examine the product to see if it supports automatic data retrieval and find out exactly which data source the program uses. If you plan to track a large number of securities, first make sure that the supported data services offer both the historical and current quotes on the types of securities you plan to analyze, and that the rates charged are reasonable. The price on a single quote can range from under one cent to over five cents. Alternatively, some services, such as Dial/Data, offer flat-rate access and various downloading capabilities at set prices. If you are planning on building up a large database, the differences in data acquisition costs will have an impact on the cost of operating the program. Also make sure that any data the software collects can be easily transferred for use in other software programs - if you should change programs or work with more than one program, your investment in the data will not be lost. <P>


Technical analysis programs vary widely in the types of indicators they provide. They may emphasize the analysis of a particular market or security type and provide those indicators most suited for that type of analysis. The Technician by Equis is geared for the analysis of the overall direction of the market and contains a different set of indicators than its sibling program MetaStock, which is a more general technical analysis tool. Look for programs that allow you to define your own indicators and perform backtesting. In using a technical analysis program, there is still a lot of judgment involved in the process. You must determine the appropriate indicator to apply to particular securities and investment horizons and how to correctly interpret it. Stay away from "black box" programs that have some secret formula for picking stock market moves. It is easy to optimize a set of rules to work over a historical time period; most, however, will not work in today's market environment. If you are interested in a program that includes pre-defined rules, look for one that discloses the factors currently driving its decision process. <P>

<STRONG>Computerized Investing Tips</STRONG><P>


The computer can be a very useful tool for the investor. The table at the end of this article provides you with a list of some of the programs that are more popular with our members. Before selecting a program, keep these items in mind:
- Ask for a demo version of the product. If one is not available, get a brochure and make sure that you can return the product if you are not satisfied. Some vendors offer a full refund, others charge a restocking fee, while still others will not refund your money at all. Understand the return policy before you buy the product, not after.
- Look at the support policies of the company: Do they offer telephone support and, if so, when is it available? Some vendors charge for providing help. Some may operate a bulletin board system (BBS in computer lingo) or forum that you can connect to - not only to solve problems, but also to get operating tips.
<UL><LI>If you are purchasing via mail order, it is best to do so with a credit card. If you have problems either receiving the product or getting it to work, then you have some recourse. The Fair Credit Billing Act gives you some power to withhold payment on items purchased if you have made a good faith effort to provide the seller with an opportunity to correct any problems.
<LI> Most importantly, try talking to other investors. Attend a local chapter meeting; log onto a BBS that focuses on investments, such as the no-cost system operated by the AAII (BBS number 312/280-8565). Most on-line services have investment special interest forums, which, like a BBS, allow users to read and leave electronic messages with other users.</UL><P>


In using and selecting an investment program, keep in mind that the computer is only a tool to aid the user in the decision-making process. Just as buying a hammer will not make you a carpenter, buying a computer system and investment software will not make you a successful investor. <P>

It is your knowledge, aided by the information gathering and processing capabilities of a computer system, that will lead to success. <P>
