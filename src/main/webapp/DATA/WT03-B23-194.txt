<H3>Attorney Fees
</H3><P>Most law firms charge a contingent attorney fee (a percentage of
your money recovery) to handle auto accident cases. If there is no recovery,
there are no attorney fees.
<P>Attorney fees charged for auto accident cases vary among law firms. Therefore,
it pays to shop around to find not only an experienced lawyer to handle your
claim, but also a law firm that charges a competitive contingency fee. As
an example, some law firms charge 33% of the total money recovery if the
case is settled without a trial; 40% if a trial occurs; and 50% if there
is an appeal of the claim. <EM>Our firm negotiates each fee based on the
complexity of the case and the factual circumstances.</EM>
<P>The bottom line is to find an experienced lawyer with reasonable attorney
fees. After all, you, the accident victim, deserve the lion's share of the
settlement, not the lawyers.
<H3>What Are the Costs Involved in Auto Accident Claims?
</H3><P>All law firms pass on charges to accident victims for court costs
and costs to obtain the client's medical records and reports. In order to
settle your claim, we will need to obtain a copy of your hospital and doctor
records. This typically costs $15 to $30 per medical provider. Also, a doctor's
report is needed to determine if you will have any continuing disabilities.
The cost for doctors' reports varies, but are generally between $75 - $150.
<P>Most claims settle out of court, but if a <A HREF="lit.htm">lawsuit </A>
is necessary, there is usually a filing fee of approximately $100 to $200.
Other court costs may include the cost to serve the court papers on the
defendant, deposition fees and expert witness fees.  If the claim goes through
trial, the total costs average $2,000 to $3,000 for a simple case with the
testimony of one doctor, and can be <EM>much</EM>  higher.  Some law firms
ask the client to pay a retainer (money paid in advance) to cover these costs.
Other firms ask the client to pay these costs as they occur, and still others
allow the client to wait to pay the costs until the settlement is received.
 At Michaelsen Mix &amp; Rodrigues, L.L.C., we normally will advance these
costs.
