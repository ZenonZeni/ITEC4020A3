<BIG><STRONG> Twenty-Seven Members of Congress Call on President to Abandon Key Escrow</A></STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE = -1>May 16, 1996</FONT> <BR>
<P>
Twenty-seven members of the House of Representatives have urged President
Clinton not to proceed with the Administration's key escrow encryption
policy proposal. In a May 15 letter to the President, the bipartisan group
called on the Adminstration instead to "immediately liberalize export
controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products." The
bipartisan group, including Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va), Anna Eshoo (D-Ca),
Tom Campbell (R-Ca) and Eliot Engle (D-NY), argued that "the ability of
companies and individuals to ensure that the information they send over
communications and coputer netwroks is secure is a prerequisite to
exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure."

<BIG><STRONG>Senators Burns, Dole, Leahy, and Pressler Introduce Legislation to Challenge Clinton Administration's Encryption Export Controls</A></STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>May 2, 1996</FONT><BR>
<P>
In a move to replace the Cold War-era regulations on encryption with
policies that make sense for the global Internet, Senators Burns (R-MT),
Dole (R-KS), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Wyden (D-OR), and others today
introduced legislation to roll back the restrictions prohibiting the export
of strong encryption technology.  This historic legislation promises to
inject the debate over privacy and security on the Internet into the 1996
presidential campaign.
<P>
The bill, entitled the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996", is designed to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies for
the Internet. It is similar to a bill introduced in March by Senators Leahy
and Burns, though the new bill does not contain criminal provisions or
provisions imposing liability for third party key holders.

<BIG><STRONG>Important Hurdle Cleared in Court Battle to Overturn Crypto Export Controls</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>(April 17, 1996)</font>
<p>
A Federal judge in San Francisco has denied a Government request to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Daniel Bernstein and the Electronic Frontier Foundation that challenges the government's export restrictions on cryptography.  Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that "source code is speech" and is thus entitled to heightened First Amendment protection.  The ruling has important policy implications on the future of cryptography exports and on privacy and electronic commerce.  The ruling could also affect the ongoing legislative battle to lift export controls on cryptography.
