DTTI TO SPLIT ACCOUNTING AND CONSULTING INTO SEPARATE ENTITIES

DELOITTE TOUCHE Tohmatsu International looks set to split its
accounting and consulting businesses into two new, distinct legal
entities along the same lines that Arthur Andersen did in 1989.

The consulting arm will be called Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group,
while the accounting practice will be known as Deloitte & Touche. The
process will begin in 1996 and over time, it is intended that the new
structure will comprise all of the national practices around the world.

The aim is for the consulting group to be a unified global entity with
its own profit centre, owned by all of the group's consulting partners.
However, the accounting practices will continue to organise their
profit centres along national lines.

Late last year, DTTI announced that the UK and US consulting practices
were to join forces as the first stage in the creation of the new
consulting group (IAB 175). Last September, D&T's US member formally
announced the establishment of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, and
the UK firm will make a similar announcement in London on February 1.

A spokesman for DTTI said that "delicate ongoing" negotiations are
taking place with other European members but it could be two years or
more before those firms sign up to the global entity. Other
geographical regions are having similar talks, he said, although all of
the areas are at "different stages" of negotiation.

Both Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group and Deloitte & Touche will
continue to operate under the international administrative umbrella of
DTTI.

Serge Audouin, DTTI's head of management consultancy for Europe, said:
"Initially, this is a management integration; the financial split will
come later. This is driven by the need to globalise our practice in
line with the way clients are operating." The move depends on the
approval of the partnerships in some countries, including the US.

Meanwhile, Touche Ross, DTTI's UK member, is considering following the
lead of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young by converting to a limited
liability partnership (LLP) with its legal base in Jersey (IAB 177),
sources within the firm said.

But, since the necessary changes to Jersey law have yet to be enacted,
the firm is unwilling to make any public announcement. The sources said
Touche is hoping the prospect of seeing accounting firms set up
offshore will prompt the UK Government into changing UK law to allow
LLPs, preventing the need for a move to Jersey.

Touche is also set to change its name. The firm will be known as
Deloitte & Touche. Until now, the Deloitte name in the UK has belonged
to Coopers & Lybrand after the worldwide merger of Deloitte Haskins &
Sells and Touche Ross fell through in the UK in 1990, and the DH&S
practice was snapped up by C&L.

Originally, the Deloitte name was not to be available to Touche until
the end of 1996, but C&L agreed to an earlier date.

ACCA TO CHANGE NAME

READERS WILL recall that the UK's Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants (ACCA) sought to change its name to the Association of
Chartered Public Accountants so members could use the coveted
"chartered" title.

Well, the ACCA's best plans were partially scuttled when the Privy
Council, which oversees bodies with a royal charter, refused it
permission to use the word public. Members, however, were given the
go-ahead to use the chartered title.

The ACCA spent the Christmas holiday chewing it over and duly announced
that it is changing its name to the Association of Chartered Certified
Accountants, or ACCA for short.

Following the Privy Council's decision, the ACCA hierarchy decided that
it would be best for members to be known as Chartered Certified
Accountants, hence the new corporate name. The proposal goes to members
at the AGM in May, after which Privy Council approval will again be
sought.

Is it any wonder the public has problems distinguishing between the
various qualifications?

lexicon on January 1 when AGN International came into being.

AGN comprises CKL International, Intercontinental Accounting Associates
and a federation of firms in the US which abbreviates to CACPA. The AGN
stands for Accountants Global Network. Awfully Good Name, lads.

COOPERS & LYBRAND

PARTNERS AT Coopers & Lybrand in the UK will no doubt have taken notice
of a small ad which appeared in the Financial Times on January 8.

The ad read:"Do you have an outstanding claim against Coopers &
Lybrand? Do you have a Paramount claim against Cork Gully [C&L's former
insolvency arm]? Would you be prepared to appear in a TV documentary
about Paramount claims? If so, please send brief details initially to
Box B4181, Financial Times . . ."

It should be interesting viewing.

HONG KONG TO CONSIDER IMMUNITY FOR AUDITORS REPORTING FRAUD

A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY working party is being set up in Hong Kong to
consider a controversial government proposal to give statutory
protection to auditors who report fraud at client companies.

Formation of the working party was announced at the annual general
meeting of the Hong Kong Society of Accountants (HKSA) in December.

The group will include representatives from government, market
regulators, law enforcement agencies, the business community and other
interest groups. It will also consider the wider issue of combatting
corporate fraud.

The government first proposed giving statutory immunity to auditors who
report suspected fraud in 1994. The immunity, which would be similar to
that currently enjoyed by auditors of banks and securities houses,
would enable auditors to report their suspicions to the authorities
without fear of being sued by their clients.

Originally, the law was to have applied to both listed and non-listed
companies. But, in a progress report issued last autumn, the government
said it would narrow the scope of the legislation because of the
"highly complicated issues" involved.

According to Louis Wong, HKSA executive director and registrar, the
government has now decided that the law should apply to quoted
companies only.

Wong stressed that the new law will not put auditors under any
obligation to report fraud. "It only applies in the event that they
report it," he said.

But accountants are still worried that the immunity will create
problems for their relations with clients.

"We are concerned that an expectation might be created to seek out
fraud and that it might unfavourably affect the trust between the
client and the auditor," outgoing HKSA president Nicholas Etches told
the AGM.

A survey conducted by KPMG last year shows that fraud is a growing
problem in Hong Kong. The firm found that 80 percent of responding
companies thought the incidence of fraud would increase, compared with
70 percent a year earlier. Some 77 percent said fraud is a"serious
problem", up from 62 percent in 1994.

BKR SIGNS UP MEMBER FIRM IN TURKEY

BKR INTERNATIONAL has expanded its global coverage by signing up a
member firm in Turkey. The firm, ISIK Yeminli Mali Musavirlik, which
was previously unaffiliated, provides BKR with Turkish representation
for the first time.

ISIK, which joined the BKR network towards the end of last year, posted
fiscal 1995 revenues of TL16 billion ($270,000), an increase of just
over 52 percent on 1994.

The six-partner firm operates out of one office in Istanbul and employs
12 professionals and three support staff. Fifty-five percent of fee
income comprises audit and accountancy work, with tax contributing 30
percent and other work the remaining 15 percent.

BKR targeted Turkey because of the steady growth in its economy as well
as its growing links with the European Union. "Turkey has developed
close links with the European Union and may one day be a full member,"
said Charles Tucker, BKR's London-based secretary.

There was a growing demand among BKR's European members, particularly
in Germany, for representation in Turkey.

BKR's search for a suitable firm took 12 months, according to Tucker,
who said ISIK was selected from a short list of two. The firm was
chosen because of its size and profile, and the fact that it
has"definite expansion plans" outside Istanbul played a key role in the
final decision. It is also longer established than the other firms
which were under consideration.

Many of ISIK's clients are in the textiles, shipping and consumer
products industries. Work for multi-national clients currently accounts
for about 25 percent of its revenues. No list of clients is available.

In IAB's annual world survey last month, BKR ranked 20th with revenues
of $341 million, an increase of 10.7 percent on 1994.

NEXIA TO RECRUIT TWO MEMBER FIRMS IN SOUTH AFRICA

NEXIA INTERNATIONAL is set to recruit its first member firms in South
Africa following several months of negotiations. The group has all but
formalised arrangements with Levitt Kirson, the CKL (now known as AGN
International) member firm, and Josman & Seidel, one of three HLB
affiliates there.

The two firms, which will give Nexia coverage in Johannesburg, Durban
and Cape Town, are forming an association of independent firms with a
third member likely to be added in Port Elizabeth later this year.

The combined fee income of the firm will add about R13 million ($3.6
million) to Nexia's global revenues. Levitt Kirson's Johannesburg
operation, which has eight partners and around 45 staff, had 1995
revenues of roughly R6 million, according to managing partner Lennie
Furman, while the firm's Durban office, which has two partners and
around 12 staff, had revenues of between R1.5 million and R1.8 million.
The two are separate profit centres.

Josman & Seidel, meanwhile, has revenues of roughly R5.5 million. The
firm has eight partners and a total staff of around 50.

Each of the firms will use the Nexia name in conjunction with their own
- the first time that Nexia has allowed its affiliates to use its name.
Previously, the Amsterdam-based group prohibited the use of its title
so as to shield the network from any possible litigation.

Nigel Hodges, Nexia's executive director, said the change of heart
followed legal advice. "We have taken legal advice both from the US and
the UK and the lawyers said there would be very little extra exposure
by having a link name used by members," he explained. "We just have to
make it clear that we are an international firm of separate independent
accountants."

Nexia's board of directors will meet in South Africa on March 10 and 11
to rubberstamp the use of the Nexia name, and to formally approve both
firms' applications.

Initially, the local firms will operate independently of each other.
According to Furman, the firms will have a common staff training
policy, undertake joint marketing campaigns and tender jointly for
certain work.

Furman cited dissatisfaction with CKL as its reason for quitting. "We
were unhappy with the CKL situation," he said. AGN, into which CKL has
merged, has "still got a long way to go to reach the size of Nexia", he
added.

Nick Blake, AGN's chief executive, said he was "disappointed" at the
news of Levitt Kirson's departure although it was not "totally
unexpected". He has arranged a meeting on January 18 with an
unaffiliated firm in Cape Town in the hope that it may fill the gap.

Sonny Josman, Josman & Seidel's managing partner, said the local firms
may eventually merge."I would think we will make a decision on that
within the next three years," he said. According to Josman, the
federation may expand into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe if suitable
firms can be found.

HLB's chief executive, Peter Frost, said incompatibilities between
Josman & Seidel and its Johannesburg member, Freedman Scher, resulted
in the split of its federation.

In addition to losing Josman & Seidel, Alleson & Company, HLB's Durban
affiliate, has also given notice to quit. Frost said replacements in
Cape Town and Durban have already been lined up, although he declined
to name them. He was planning to meet with at least one of the
prospective firms on January 15 in Johannesburg.

Nexia has never had a presence in South Africa, although one of its
predecessors, Spicer & Oppenheim, was represented by Fischer Hoffman
Stride until 1990 when the local firm switched to Pannell Kerr Forster.

US BILL ELIMINATING FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS IS PASSED

THE PRIVATE Securities Litigation Reform Act, which among other things
will eliminate frivolous lawsuits against accounting firms, has been
passed into law despite being vetoed by President Clinton.

The passing of the bill has been welcomed by the US accounting
profession. Ernst & Young chairman Philip Laskawy said: "Frivolous
lawsuits in the past have drained resources from economic activities
such as research and development and new investment that fuel business
growth. Those with legitimate securities claims still have recourse
through our legal system. By eliminating meritless lawsuits, the new
bill will make the American economy more productive and efficient."

A statement from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
said: "The passage of this legislation is testament to the widely-held
belief that the tide of frivolous securities litigation in this country
must be stopped and sanity restored to a legal system clearly out of
balance.

"This bill is a fair balance between the rights of truly- defrauded
investors and those start-up companies and outside professionals who
have become victims of a small group of entrepreneurial lawyers abusing
the legal system."

The bill had been awaiting the signature of the US President when IAB
went to press with the final issue of last year (IAB 177), and
proponents of the reforms were confident that Clinton would sign it
into law.

However, he chose to veto the legislation under enormous pressure from
consumer groups and trial lawyers.

In the end, the veto was too late as both houses of Congress were able
to override his decision. The House of Representatives had backed the
bill by 309 votes to 100 - 29 votes more than needed for the override.
The Senate vote, 68 votes to 30 in favour, eventually proved sufficient
to override the president's decision having originally fallen just
short of the total required.

The new law is designed to eliminate routine filing of class action
lawsuits against public companies with no more evidence than a sharp
drop in stock price. It will also prevent the targeting of defendants
with"deep pockets", without regard to their culpability.

The legislation provides a new safe harbour provision for
forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide
prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those
statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements identifying factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected.

KPMG STOKES KENNEDY CROWLEY DROPS LOCAL NAMES

KPMG STOKES Kennedy Crowley, Ireland's largest accounting firm, has
altered its identity by dropping the local names from its title.

The change, which took effect on January 1, is part of a worldwide move
by KPMG members to standardise the group's identity. In February of
last year, KPMG's UK affiliate dropped the Peat Marwick name from its
logo (IAB 157).

"Our new name will provide us with a single strong identity worldwide
and help us to assist our clients to compete even more effectively in
both the Irish market and overseas," said managing partner Jerome
Kennedy.

The SKC partnership was founded in 1972, although the firm's roots can
be traced back to 1876 when Stokes Brothers was formed. It became the
Irish member of Peat Marwick International in 1980, and became the
Irish representative of KPMG in 1987 following the global merger with
KMG.

SKC operates as one partnership in Ireland, unlike most of its Big Six
rivals which have separate entities north and south. The firm operates
out of four offices, employs over 800 people, and had fiscal 1995
revenues of IR#36.2 million ($58 million), a drop of just over 1
percent on the previous year.

KPMG's move means that Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse is the only one
of the Big Six in Ireland to retain the local firm's name as part of
its identity.

AGN INTERNATIONAL SELECTS FIRST BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AGN INTERNATIONAL, the new network formed on January 1 from the merger
of CKL International with Intercontinental Accounting Associates, has
appointed a ten-man board of directors, five from each group.

Six of the board members are based in Europe, three in North America
and one in South America. The CKL members are: France's Guillaume de
Saint-Gerand, CKL's last chairman; London-based Leon Nahon; Peter Grote
from Switzerland; German Rainer Schmidt; and Julio Pilon, who is based
in Uruguay.

The IAA contingent comprises: Louis Philips from France; Thomas
Harbrecht, IAA's last president, Raymond Falconetti and Gary Seehoff
all of the US; and Steven Jeffcott from the UK.

CKL's Nick Blake fills the position of chief executive and continues to
be based in CKL's headquarters in London, but no chairman has yet been
chosen. Blake said a decision is unlikely until the board holds its
first full meeting in mid-March in Miami.

DUTCH MEMBER'S LEAD PARTNER MADE ACPA EURO CHAIRMAN

ACPA INTERNATIONAL has appointed a new European chairman. Wiendelt de
Lange, managing partner of ACPA's Dutch member, Eshuis Groep, took on
the role of chairman on January 1. His term of office will last for two
and a half years.

De Lange's aims for his term include increasing the network's coverage
in continental Europe and Africa, which is currently linked to the
firm's European region. Africa will be split into a separate region
when the number of members there is increased.

In Europe, ACPA hopes to extend its coverage into northern Italy,
France and Germany. It is also looking for new members in Norway,
Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

De Lange replaced Daniel Faura, managing partner of ACPA's Spanish
member, Faura Casas. Faura served as chairman for around 18 months.
According to de Lange, Faura's term was cut short because of his
obligations to the Spanish firm. Faura Casas recently formed an
alliance with Audiberia, the Summit International member, in a bid to
maximise services throughout Spain.

ACPA's European secretariat has been based in the offices of Eshuis
Groep since September 1994, following a decade of being located in
London. "Among other reasons, this makes it easier to develop eastern
Europe," de Lange said. ACPA has 29 members in 15 European countries,
while fee income for the region totals more than $50 million.

PW HUNGARY CREATES SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY FOR REAL ESTATE UNIT

PRICE WATERHOUSE in Hungary has spun off its real estate division into
a separate legal entity. The company, Real Partners, was set up on
January 1 following a year of negotiation.

PW holds a 60 percent stake in the company while the other 40 percent
is held by Karoly Flaskay, a local real estate specialist. Profits,
however, will be divided on an equal basis. No predicted fee income for
the new unit has been released.

Real Partners, set up as a limited liability company, resulted from a
need to create an independent unit to cope with demand. "Demand for
asset valuation and real estate was continuous although fluctuating,"
said Andrew Terner, PW's head of corporate finance and co-managing
director of Real Partners. "It is an important area in a market which
is asset rich and cash poor," he added.

The company already has an established list of clients. Some were
clients of PW's real estate division, while others were clients of
Flaskay.

The services provided by the company include evaluation of real estate,
real estate development projects and brokerage services such as
searching for investors. Real Partners' only office is based in
Budapest, where Flaskay is backed up by five professional staff and one
administrator.

FEELING AT HOME

It's been a hard five years, but western accounting firms are starting
to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reports

IT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, and
only now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients to
western fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with the
local Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.

Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to do
business. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keeping
control of that growth and turning it into profits is a different
matter.

Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,
the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, with
fiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking even
currently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according to
managing partner Duleep Aluwihare.

"We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some of
our more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage to
continue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,
we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run out
of investment opportunities."

Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one of
the few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although it
plans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice or
Cracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In order
to set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going to
maintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve in
this marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.

This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,
but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticket
items," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basic
work, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.

Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,
Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clients
include Poland's Finance Ministry.

Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.
Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrand
and Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived in
Poland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess when
the firm should start making a profit.

Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking to IAB last July before
returning to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're
not just here for a financial return on investment, we're here to make
sure that Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."

C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking at
opening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.

Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of the
market, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,
Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firm
has acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bank
and of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successes
include the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which
raised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing group
Okocim.

PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgeted
to start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,
the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After five
years in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-national
company investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growth
is running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.

PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where the
firm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clients
include Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.
One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatised
Bank Gdanski.

Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some time
are KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.

"We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner Bill
Drysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where we
are largely self-sufficient."

Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at Barents
Group, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of new
clients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firm
recently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run its
German practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have a
fully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said.
"Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."

KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics group
Siemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polish
clients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,
Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurance
companies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices in
Cracow and Poznan during the last year.

At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits gets
short shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm has
always been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financial
support from outside, other than very small amounts. All the other
firms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they have
X amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.
They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."

In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440
employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of its
rivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw and
Szczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is a
headache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line.

"Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It's
difficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated into
a corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standards
right way."

E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as much
business as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when it
hired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &
Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.

Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T.
"These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speak
only with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Often
you'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,
all the rest will follow."

The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in the
Polish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is the
smallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strong
position in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firm
took action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz as
head of the Polish business (IAB 151). Leslaw Paga was head of the
Polish Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.

Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is sure
that Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitely
enhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said.
"There've been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."

Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its position
in Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industries
and service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong position
in financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say we
were latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"
he explained.

Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bank
and of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's
64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in the
banking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3
million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.

D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk and
Cracow during 1995.

Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.
Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four other
mid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co-ordinating
partner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "the
sort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging with
another firm.

He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name the
prospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to another
network. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we are
looking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with a
heavy UK or English language capability," he said.

Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switched
international affiliations from CKL International to Alliott Peirson
International during 1995 (IAB 171). Baltic Accountants continues to
also represent RSM International and GMN International.

The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issue
for many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firms
like to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to local
clients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing in
Polish equity partners than others.

Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firm
holding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and US
affiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has been
given the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, while
KPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or
"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.

According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managed
firm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly owned by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent from
the start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the local
practices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."

Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agree
that fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gap
between what western firms are charging and what local clients are
willing to pay is narrowing.

One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment must
pay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet the
market half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper local
firms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it first
arrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.
Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in
"strategic situations".

Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of a
western-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came into
effect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accounting
procedures more into line with International Accounting Standards and
to move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on tax
compliance.

Another area where western accountants are making more encouraging
noises is in relations between the international firms and the local
Chamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when the
chamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.
Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted to
the chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners that
Poland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shutting
new blood out of the profession.

Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences being
mended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciak
said. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of course
there will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.
Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bit
frightening to them."

While the situation regarding audit training and exams remains
unacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamber
will rethink its approach.

Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous in
admitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems to
have gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably be
reviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said.
"And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."

After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all part
of the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make sure
the chamber is a strong and active body."

Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and that
the growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feels
that this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We all
experience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."

CAPTURING THE '90S SPIRIT

Spencer Lanthier, KPMG Canada's chairman and chief executive since
1993, talks to Gundi Jeffrey about the firm's increasing emphasis on
consulting services, as well as the shift to a new corporate culture
that better reflects the spirit of the 1990s

AFTER SEVERAL years of flat and even declining revenues, KPMG in Canada
is poised to regain healthier growth. Much of this is due to a wide
range of new service initiatives - mostly consulting-based - aimed at
meeting the needs of an increasingly- sophisticated and demanding
marketplace.

Spencer Lanthier, 55, has been with the firm since 1960, becoming a
partner in 1972, managing partner of the Toronto office in 1984 and
vice-chairman of the Greater Toronto region and deputy chairman of the
partnership board in 1989. He has also served on various committees of
the Quebec and Ontario institutes and, in 1993, was a member of the
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' corporate governance task
force. He took on his present role with KPMG in 1993.

IAB: Your revenues in the year to February 1995 were stagnant, but
KPMG's worldwide results were up by more than 13 percent in fiscal
1995. What do you expect your fiscal 1996 results to be like?

Lanthier: We expect our fiscal 1996 top-line to be up about 5 percent.
This is after four years of flat or negative growth, which has been
consistent throughout our business in Canada.

The reasons for this low growth relate to some major shifts in the
market for our services. Regulatory changes to audit requirements
continue to hit all the big firms. Two years ago, for example, the
Canada Business Corporations Act removed the requirement for
privately-owned companies to have audits. And more recently, the
Ontario Government eliminated the audit requirement for companies with
revenues of less than C$100 million ($73.66 million).

Another issue is the high degree of corporate consolidation that has
taken place in Canada. For example, in 1994, one of our major clients,
Rogers Communications, took over the publishing company Maclean Hunter.
I can assure you that the fees for the combined company are a lot less
than what they were separately.

So all in all, the market for large-corporation audit services has
shrunk substantially and continues to decline. In that context, we're
quite pleased with the growth of 5 percent in Canada this year.

A lot of the growth internationally is coming from emerging markets
such as eastern Europe and the Far East. But, in some of the more
mature economies, the growth hasn't been that significant.

IAB: The international firm has started reporting total billings to
clients rather than net revenues. Will Canada follow suit?

Lanthier: Internationally, our firm - and other firms also - is now
reporting our total billings per client. We've moved in that direction
because we believe it more closely reflects the way we do business.

For many years, the majority of our billings were based on the time we
spent on the job. But now, we have more alliances and co-venture
arrangements. Often, we act as prime contractor in projects that
involve various sub-contractors. In the past, we would have treated our
sub-contractors' billings as expense reimbursement and deducted them
from total billings to report our net fee income. We've concluded that
it makes more sense to reflect our total sub-contractors billings as
revenues. In summary, like most other major businesses, KPMG's revenues
simply reflect our total worldwide invoices to clients.

In Canada, however, we'll continue to report on a net fee income basis
for the time being. The reason for this is that the Canadian firms have
agreed for many years on a set of precise guidelines for reporting
income to ensure compatibility.

IAB: KPMG Canada has launched quite a few initiatives and service areas
over the past year. Can you tell me about them and what you are hoping
to achieve with them?

Lanthier: The first is KPMG Investigation and Security Inc. This new
group, headed by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner
and past Interpol president Norman Inkster, offers a full range of
impartial investigative services to businesses in Canada and around the
globe (IAB 176). KPMG ISI assists companies in cases where traditional
policing agencies are no longer able to help.

It's really an extension of the forensic accounting division. We're
continuing to offer traditional forensic accounting services, but we're
also expanding into the corporate security field. We did this because
we knew that most [Canadian] police forces have been forced by cutbacks
to place white collar crime very low on their list of priorities.

Not only do we investigate white collar crime, but we also look at the
whole security arrangements companies have in place, not just the
traditional internal controls. For example, are they protecting their
executives adequately? Are their facilities secure? In the wake of last
year's Oklahoma bombing, we received several inquiries from clients
interested in reviewing their security.

Also, as Canadian companies expand offshore, there is a need for them
to review the viability and integrity of potential joint venture
partners. We can help in this area.

We've been delighted with the results of this division already and
we've hired, at last count, six more former police officers.

Another success story is our ISO 9000 practice, launched in early 1995
in six centres across the country. KPMG Quality Registrar is one of
only 12 accredited ISO 9000 registrars in Canada. And so far, we are
the only Big Six firm that has obtained this accreditation.

We have two major services. First we certify that clients have
processes that comply with ISO standards. Then there is an annual
compliance report, that ensures they continue to be in compliance.

This work is really a natural extension of our audit services and we've
been very successful with it in Canada. In the first full year, our
fees were about C$2 million.

Next, very recently, we established a strategic alliance with MD
Management, the financial services subsidiary of the Canadian Medical
Association. This will allow KPMG to provide physicians and their
families with accounting, tax and business advice. We were the only
national accounting firm to participate in this alliance.

KPMG's benchmarking initiative was launched in 1995, with the firm's
first national benchmark study of the corporate finance function. This
study examines the role of the finance department in large companies -
those with revenues of more than C$150 million - and middle-market
companies, with revenues of C$15 million to C$150 million, in the
manufacturing, retail and distribution sectors.

By focusing on performance measures such as cost, productivity and
quality in finance, the study aims to help our clients better gauge
their relative performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

KPMG's new Centre for Risk Assessment and Control Design was
established to help organisations develop and implement cost-effective
control and risk management systems, and to exchange best practices,
particularly in the area of control and risk assessment.

In February 1995, we rolled out our forest management practice, and it
has grown steadily. Three provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and
Alberta, have in recent years passed new forestry legislation requiring
companies to comply with cutting standards, reforestation, and so on.
We help them ensure that they have the processes in place to comply
with the regulation and help them with their reporting to the
regulatory authorities. It's not a huge practice yet, but one where
there is a real client need that we're trying to meet.

We also have a rapidly-growing SAP and Baan implementation practice.
SAP has really taken off in the industrialised world and has become the
dominant software standard and dominant software platform for financial
management systems. We, together with others, are registered suppliers
and implementers of SAP. Baan is something similar.

I believe our Aboriginal services practice has also been a big success.
More than 20 offices provide a range of financial and management
consulting services to Aboriginal communities across Canada. With
continuing progress in land claim settlements, Aboriginal people are
becoming a major economic force in Canada, so the growth potential for
this service area is significant.

IAB: I understand that KPMG has developed something called"Project
Globe", which has identified 14 service areas for growth. What does
that mean for the Canadian firm?

Lanthier: Project Globe is a framework that gives our consulting
practices around the world a common set of priorities. We adopted it a
year or so ago and it involves our focusing on three broad areas of
service.

The first is enabling technologies, which include services such as
information technology strategy and systems implementation. The
performance improvement area includes human resources and quality
management services, among others. Strategic financial management
includes capital transactions, treasury management and similar
financial consulting services.

IAB: Now to an old favourite that won't go away: professional
liability. What is KPMG doing in terms of risk management strategy to
dampen the threat of legal action?

Lanthier: The number of lawsuits against accounting firms in Canada has
dropped over the past five years. Whether that's a result of improved
risk management or a result of a better economy is hard to say. Most of
the big lawsuits that we've seen in Canada happened as a result of the
real estate melt-down of five or six years ago. They had nothing to do
with audit failure. Since the real estate markets have stabilised,
there haven't been any other major lawsuits coming forward.

We have three simple rules for risk management: be careful about who we
work for; be careful about what we do for them and be careful about
whom we assign to do the work. I think we all pay closer attention to
those rules than we did a few years ago. IAB: What do you see as KPMG
Canada's biggest challenge in the next few years?

Lanthier: I am focusing on two major areas. We have to grow our top
line. You have to grow to be successful in our country. We're obviously
the largest firm, with the largest market share, which makes it more
difficult to grow.

That brings up the question of our core services. The audit is a
declining market. So is tax compliance.

More and more taxpayers are buying tax preparation software for C$100
or so, rather than coming to us. In the future, they could be
downloading tax software from the Internet for free.

However, the total market for consulting services is expanding rapidly.
That's why we've put a big emphasis on developing new,
consulting-oriented services at a fairly rapid rate.

Our second challenge is human resources - our people. Twenty-five years
ago, firms like ours were the employer of choice for a lot of the
people going through business schools and other faculties. But
recently, we've become a less attractive option. Some of our human
resource policies, cultures and practices simply aren't up to date. We
recognise that.

To that end, in June, we brought on board a human resources change
management person at a very senior level. John Ellsworth brings years
of global HR experience, having worked in general management consulting
and with major corporations.

John joined KPMG as a senior partner and a member of our management
committee. He is working closely with me and other people in the firm
to help us change our culture. We want to ensure that we can attract
the best people, that we reward based on competence and not just on
seniority. In the past, we have operated as a rather militaristic
hierarchy. We are determined to break down some of the barriers that
have existed, to move people forward, allow them to progress when they
are ready.

It will take a long time for us to change and upgrade and get away from
the sweatshop mentality that has dominated the accounting profession in
the past. You don't change a culture that's been ingrained for 75 years
over six months or a year, but we're determined to make progress.

These are my two priorities - to change our culture over the next few
years and to grow our top line. The two go hand in hand. If you have
the best people, you'll grow.
