into today's job market without basic academic skills</th></tr>

<p>There are new opportunities that are currently unfolding that may required special talents and abilities in just those areas where 
many individuals with learning difficulties often have their greatest strengths, such as visualization for scientific concepts and the 
analysis and manipulation of complex, three-dimensional information graphical displays on personal computers. </p>
<p>Yesterday's person with a learning disability entered a simpler adult society. Today's person with a learning disability enters a 
highly lingual, educated society. There are different kinds of problems and different kinds of tools that require different talents 
and favor different kinds of brains. Some who were learning disabled were: </p>
<dl>
<dd>Albert Einstein	</dd>
<dd>Thomas Edison	</dd>
<dd>Lewis Carroll	</dd>
<dd>Winston Churchill </dd>
<dd>Pablo Picasso	</dd>
<dd>Walt Disney </dd>
<dd>Nelson Rockefeller	</dd>
<dd>Hans Christian Andersen	</dd>
<dd>William Butler Yeats </dd>
</dl>
<p>We do not hear about the rest, whose talents and intelligence may have been lost to the world. Conventional educational 
system may be focusing on the wrong kinds of skills and weeding out many of those who might have the most to give. </p>
