<H2>COLLOIDAL SILVER </H2> 
 <P>COLLOIDAL SILVER is an amazing natural alternative to antibiotics. <B>There is no disease causing bacteria that can live in the presence of even minute traces of metallic silver.</B>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER contains only aural ingredients that help the body fight infections just like synthetic antibiotics, but without their damaging side effects. Its natural light golden color is characteristic of its high quality. The concentration of five parts of silver per million contained Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is the most effective, safe formulation available. Higher concentrations can actually be less effective as they may interfere with beneficial bacteria and cause skin discoloration, even when used internally. Every family desiring optimum natural health should have a bottle of Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER in the medicine cabinet.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>QUALITY</H2>
<P>The Life Plus top grade COLLOIDAL SILVER is produced by a highly technical electrocolloidal method employing an electrical current. It has a pH of approximately 6.5 and is a natural golden color. Usually, an antibiotic kills a half dozen or so bacteria, but silver kills some 650. Resistant strains do not develop to silver like they do with antibiotics.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>
<P>Silver was used as a proven germ fighter in the early 1900's. It was the mainstay of antibiotic treatment, and today's technology is even more superior. The medical journal <I>Lancet</I> reported phenomenal results from colloidal silver in 1914. Dr. Henry Crooks showed colloidal silver to be highly germicidal yet absolutely harmless and non-toxic to humans. Colloidal Silver has been proven useful against all species of fungi, bacteria, protozoa, parasites and certain viruses, which are often killed within minutes. L>C> For, M>D> at the UCLA School of Medicine reported in 1988 that silver solutions were effective against Streptococcus, Pyogenes, Staphylococcus Aures, Neisseria Gonorrhea, Garnerella, Vaginalis, Salmonella Typhu and other enteric pathogens. He also found that it was fungicidal for Candida Albicans, Candida Globata and M. Furfur.</P>
<P><I>Science Digest</I> reported in an article in 1978, entitled "Our Mightiest Germ Fighter" that "silver is emerging as a wonder of  modern medicine." Dr. Robert O. Becker, M.D. stated, "we have rediscovered the fact that silver kills bacteria, which had been known for centuries...when antibiotics were discovered, uses for silver as an antibiotic were discarded."</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLLOID</H2>
<P>The term "colloid" refers to a substance that consists of ultra-fine particles within the range of 0.005 to 0.015 microns in diameter. In a true colloid, like Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER, these particles cannot be seen by the naked eye and stay suspended as they are electrically charged. This activates the germicidal quality of the silver.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>PRODUCTION</H2>
<P>The "grind" method can b used, but the particles are too large and a protein, or other, stabilizer has to be included. However, stabilizers can interfere with effectiveness. Also, a chemical process can be used but the end product is usually too acid and not as effective.</P>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is produced by the electrocolloidal process, which allows extremely fine silver particles to be suspended in solution by the tiny charge placed n them. This process replaces the need for any chemicals or stabilizers and the product can be called a true colloid. Then, the particles can remain in suspension almost indefinitely.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLOR</H2>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is the ideal golden yellow color. Other products that are not true colloids will be another color, unless coloring is added. Color is a critical indicator of colloidal silver quality.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>AS NATURE INTENDED</H2>
<P>Silver may be linked to the proper functioning of our immune system and that people with inadequate intakes may be more prone to infection. Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER contains 99.999% pure colloidal silver particles 0.0001 microns in diameter with a concentration of 20 parts per million that have little effect on the friendly bacteria in our digestive tract. However, be aware of products with higher concentrations as they can attack friendly bacteria just like some antibiotics. This could upset your natural balance and lead to other complications. With colloidal silver, higher concentrations are not necessarily better. As a matter of fact, the opposite is usually true.<P>

<H2>HOW TO USE COLLOIDAL SILVER</H2>
<P>When used as an antibiotic, adults and children twelve and older, take one, two or three teaspoonfuls of Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER by mouth three times a day. Younger children can take half this amount. It is tasteless, odorless and non-irritating to sensitive tissues such as the eyes, so it can also be used like a first aid spray on cuts, sores, burns, insect bites, etc.</P>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is furnished with a sprayer top on the bottle. The sprayer makes it convenient to use as a topical spray. However, it is recommended that you also spray it into the mouth when taking it orally. Forty pumps from the sprayer equals one teaspoonful of solution. For maximum utilization, pump several sprays into the mouth, hold for a few seconds and swallow. Repeat this process until forty full pumps are swallowed for each teaspoonful desired. This allows the silver to be absorbed sublingually (under the tongue), getting it into the system sooner, plus bypassing the intestinal flora.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Adult and children 12 years and older, take one to three
teaspoonfuls three times per day as needed. Children under 12, take one-half
the adult dosage. Can be sprayed on sores, cuts and burns as well.
