ABSTRACT Thermal bridges are parts of the buildings envelope which
in general are not correctly insulated. Problems relating to thermal
bridges are often severe condensation and mould growth and a significant
increase of the energy losses. At present, these problems still
frequently occur in new buildings but especially in rehabilitation
projects. In several countries so-called thermal bridge atlases
already exist. These can help the designer to increase his understanding
of the problems but they are not a real help in solving his specific
problems. One alternative is to perform detailed thermal bridge
simulations. This however is expensive and not al all part of
the daily practice. This project aims to offer a computerised
thermal bridge atlas for 2-dimensional details. The target is
to have at the end of the project 750 details in the atlas. The
main characteristics of the proposed atlas is its user friendliness,
the large flexibility of modifying the detail (layer thickness,
materials, boundary conditions,..) and the way of presenting the
results (e.g. colour pictures showing the isothermal lines, the
heat flux lines,..)The final products of this project are extremely
powerful tools for so-called global training actions (for schools,
colleges, architects, building contractors,..) It can be used
in relation to all building types.

model has been developed using a set of three coefficients which
characterize completely the hygroscopic inertia of a room. That
model has been included in EDF-CLIM 2000 modelling and simulation
system. The comparisons between experimental tests and simulation
results are very satisfactory. So validated for water vapour,
the approach described in that paper could be directly generalized

ABSTRACT A pilot study has been carried out to investigate the
monitoring and evaluation needs in the frame of research on energy
performance and indoor climate in occupied buildings. The building,
situated in Northern Italy, has been completely monitored for
ventilation and energy demand during two winter periods. In particular
four main topics have been subject of investigation. The usefulness
of combining simulation and identification techniques for data
analysis of the building and the burner and in addition the conduction
of a simultaneous simulation of building and heating system. Furthermore
the evaluation of real data for the thermal characterisation of
the building from the energy balance, has been performed. Ventilation
experiments in occupied buildings and linking the results with
energy analysis has been of special interest. At last an inquiry
has been carried out to get information from people living in
the house about their habits during winter and summer periods,
concerning window opening, cooling etc. a link between the topics
will be discussed in the frame of energy savings and comfort.
The presented work will be used for the definition of a future
project with an European dimension on energy performance and indoor
air quality. Further research studies and the use of dedicated
monitoring equipment for field experiments of ventilation rates,
temperatures, humidity, etc. will be discussed.

ABSTRACT A program of work involving the measurement of ventilation
rates, air velocities and temperatures has commenced within the
new Engineering and Manufacture Building, De Montfort University,
and some initial results are reported here. Measurements have
been recorded for &quot;summer&quot; conditions, average and maximum
occupancy levels. Results obtained so far indicate that ventilation
rates through one of the theatres are driven by both stack and
wind induced effects, and can be much higher than predicted by
computer and physical models. Room air temperatures show little
variation with time, due to the heavy weight nature of the building
structure and its exposed areas. Further work will examine mid-season
and winter conditions and will contribute to a design guide for
large naturally ventilated spaces.

ABSTRACT The evaluation of the effectiveness of a ventilation
system is a difficult problem which necessitates important experimental
methods and simulation programs which are not always readily available.
The study presented here proposes a period for defining a simplified
evaluation methodology for ventilation effectiveness. In a first
stage the work concerns the theoretical characterisation of plane
jets and the setting up of a laboratory experiment destined for
the study of jet diffusion using the tracer gas technique. The
first experimental results give us information about the global
characterisation of air flows encountered in a ventilated cell
by an isothermal plane jet. They show reasonable agreement with
theoretical prediction.

ABSTRACT The INRS (French National Institute for Research and
Occupational Safety) promotes the concept of predictive ventilation
using the Computational Fluid Dynamics code EOL in the purpose
of improving working conditions. 1. EOL simulates velocity, concentration
and temperature fields from the specification of the geometry
of the enclosure, the ventilation system and the pollutant sources.
It is available in two and three-dimensional versions. Validation
procedures were completed for the 2D version, whereas this article
is concerned with the 3D case. As a matter of fact, 3D validation
of EOL is conducted for velocity under isothermal conditions in
the particular case of a painting area model in the INRS hydraulic
bench. The INRS hydraulic bench simulates steady water flows in
approximate Reynolds similarity and is equipped with a laser Doppler
velocimeter that provides 2 non-simultaneous velocity components.
Velocity measurements are done within and in the vicinity of the
model in a front view. First of all, the assumed symmetry of the
experimental device is checked with good agreement. Then, measurements
are compared with simulation results. Correlations between both
approaches suggest a good correspondence regarding simulation
and measurements. A future step of the study should include extra
comparisons with the third velocity component and as a last step
in situ measurements of velocities in the actual painting area.

ABSTRACT In the frame of the European PASCOOL project, several
experiments regarding single sided ventilation were carried out
at BBRI in the outdoor PASSYS test cell. The test room of 30 m3
has a vertical window of about 1 m2. During a first measurement
period an open cold box, which allows one to control the vertical
wind speed, was placed in front of this window. During a second
measurement period, the window was directly exposed to `real wind'.
The air flow rates through the large opening is derived from the
energy balance of the test room. This approach is possible because
the heat flow through the cell envelope can be accurately determined
thanks to the Pseudo-Adiabatic-Shell. Tracer gas measurements
were carried out in parallel. They are made difficult because
a clear air flow pattern appears and accordingly, the concentration
in the room is not homgenous. An error analysis has been applied
on both methods. The agreement between both methods is very good
and the heat balance approach proved to be more accurate than
the tracer gas technique. a correlation model was derived from
the first measurement period.

ABSTRACT After the new systems were installed in the houses, the
continuously controlled effective ventilation rate remained above
0.5 times per hour, and the system maintained low positive pressure
indoors. The houses studied had a small overpressure (<0.5 PA) even without  the pressure  adjustment.  The pressure adjustment  increased overpressure only  slightly, less than 2 Pa.  The data collected were insufficient for a  detailed energy consumption analysis; therefore, only differences  of  capacity flows were examined during several weekly  periods when the  pressure control was on or off in turns.   Capacity flows were found to  increase with increasing  pressure differences.  The pressure control did  not  affect the capacity flows in the tight house, if the  disturbances of  long-lasting periods (nights) with opened  window were neglected. In the  untight house, the pressure  control decreased energy consumption and the  capacity  flows was obtained when the air exchange rate exceeded 0.9  h-1.  High negative pressure in the houses in the radon  problem areas is not  desired.  The pressure controlled  ventilation system was found to  prevent excessive  underpressurization of houses, without increasing   capacity flows. <P>

ABSTRACT The strategy to deal with two sometimes contradictory
requirements, first to have an acceptable indoor air quality and
secondly to save energy, can be met by introducing Demand Controlled
Ventilating systems (DCV systems). Within the frame of IEA a project
with 10 participating countries was recently finished. The aim
with this paper is to summarize the main findings, conclusions,
and recommendations that all agreed on in the final document (Source
Book), The various control principles have been developed for
base and occupant related ventilation. As an example is given
the case of DCV in an auditorium with energy savings shown to
be 50% and a pay-off time less than a year. Other applications
and savings potential as well as the pay-off time are given for
dwellings, schools, day nurseries, and offices accounting for
about 85% of the non-industrial buildings.

ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to clarify the effects
of ventilation systems on ventilation effectiveness (VE) and temperature
effectiveness (TE) in office rooms. The experiments were performed
in a one third scale model of an office room provided with mixing,
underfloor and displacement ventilation systems. Other than these
three ventilation systems, the experimental parameters included
the layout of office automation (OA) equipment (personal computers
dispersed on individual desks, or aggregations of workstation
equipment concentrated in one place) The experimental results
showed that VE and TE both increased in the following order: displacement
system, underfloor system, mixing system. The VE and TE were generally
higher in the concentrated layout of OA equipment than in the
dispersed layout. However, for the displacement system, the effect
of the layout of OA equipment on VE and TE was relatively insignificant.

ABSTRACT The traditional logarithmic wall functions, originally
derived from forced convection boundary layer flow, are generally
used in conjunction with the standard k-e model to simulate air
flows in buildings. In ventilated rooms, however, the flow close
solid wall is also influenced by natural convection along vertical
surface by accounting for the effect of buoyancy. These new wall
functions have been applied in conjunction with the standard k-e
turbulence model to calculate the flow in an air-filled enclosure.
Comparisons have been made between the traditional and new wall
functions and between numerical results and experimental data.
The comparisons indicate that the numerical results can be significantly
improved by using the new wall functions for the case considered.

ABSTRACT There exist in our industrial cities, many buildings
which once formed the nucleus of industrial activity, but which
are now, due to economic changes, redundant. This is particularly
true of buildings associated with heavy manufacturing industry.
In Sheffield, England, the decline of what was once the largest
steel manufacturing industry in Western Europe, has left large
tracts of land derelict. The wonderful buildings that were home
to the steel industry stand alone and empty like &quot;dinosaurs&quot;.
This paper will discuss how one of these buildings, [referred
to as &quot;the case-study buildings&quot;], is currently being
re-configured to provide new specialist office and technical facilities
for one of the few surviving steelworks. We will discuss in general
terms, the design approach taken, but will concentrate upon how
our resolution of the environment problems inherent in the existing
structure were resolved through the creation of a number of different
&quot;internal climates&quot;. The problems encountered, such
as a lack of thermal insulation and inadequate daylighting, are
commonly faced when working within the constraints of redundant
industrial buildings. We therefore hope that the approach taken
in resolving the problems inherent in our case-study building,
and the research that it has generated, have a wider relevance.

ABSTRACT The space which immediately surrounds a building is often
neglected in relation to its effect as a climatic modifier of
the interior space of the building, because the architect conceives
his building only as a free standing object. However in many climates
this space could be more important from the functional, thermal
and visual point of view than interior space. To achieve this
it is just as necessary that it too should be designed in harmony
with nature and climate and with the basic bioclimatic considerations
in mind, such as insolation, shading, wind movement, control of
light and heat storage.

ABSTRACT Suspended timber ground floors are often used on new
houses, [1], and are also typical of a large number of houses
built before 1940, which represent a substantial building stock
that now needs refurbishment with improved insulation levels.
While the thermal performance of walls and roofs has been improved
in recent years through loft and cavity wall insulation, the heat
loss from the ground floor has been overlooked. This may constitute
up to 25% of the total heat loss from an otherwise well-insulation
house. Ventilation of the under-floor space is required to present
a build-up of moisture and subsequent rotting of the timbers,
and this serves to increase the heat loss. Earlier work showed
that the heat loss may increase by 40% at a ventilation rate of
1.5 air changes per hour[2]. The under-floor void may range in
height from a few centimetres to as much as half a metre, and
moisture enters mainly by evaporation of water from exposed earth
and from construction water drying out. If the moisture content
of the timbers exceeds 20% for only a few days, various types
of mould may begin to grow, which cause rapid deterioration of
the timbers through wet or dry rot. Ventilation is normally used
to prevent this, by means of air bricks in the outer walls. This
ventilation inevitably results in an increase in the heat loss
from the floor, and is dependent on the wind speed and the degree
of exposure of the site.

ABSTRACT The influence of natural convection on the thermal properties
of insulating porous medium with air cavity is studied. Here,
the combined effect of air movement in the air cavity and the
air movement inside the insulation is evaluated with the help
of numerical analysis. The influence of total natural convection
on the thermal properties of mineral wool, loose-fill insulation
made of small and large polystyrene ball with air cavity are studied.
The results are presented in terms of dimensionless numbers and
the temperature distribution across the insulation.

ABSTRACT Ventilation is becoming the dominant factor in the energy
balance of a building and increasing interest is being shown in
the effects of infiltration. A major contributor to overall ventilation
rates is air flow through cracks in the facades of buildings.
Increasingly, the validation of steady-state models for building
crack flow has been questioned. An approach is made to determine
the equations governing the air flow through simple cracks subject
to fluctuating pressures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses
were carried out for various crack types subjected to fluctuating
pressures. In addition, an experimental arrangement was developed
that enables the laboratory simulation of fluctuating driving
pressure signals applied to a series of cracks. Pressure fluctuations
were imposed on a 1m2 section of wall with a centrally mounted
crack and the overall volumetric air flow rate, pressure distribution
and flow direction were monitored. CFD analyses were carried out
for the crack type and specific flow conditions found from experimental
data. An analysis was made of physical test results and a comparison
made between these findings and the preliminary CFD models developed.
An introduction to CFD analysis and fluctuating crack flow work
is given and the methods used in simulating the necessary conditions
for fluctuating flow with the results of preliminary CFD analyses
are presented.

ABSTRACT In order to evaluate the influence of air conditioned
ventilation on indoor radon concentrations in air, levels of indoor
radon were studied by a continuous electrostatic radon monitor
(CERM) under normal living conditions. Results show indoor radon
concentrations in air were not much more than one in winter although
fixing family conditioner requires a sealed room which leads higher
radon level. Turning on air conditioner helps to lower indoor
radon level. Therefore its total effects are normal< ventilation < exhaust or indraft < exhaust plus  indraft, and  reduce the harm to human.  In summary, air  conditioner is good for human  health. <P>

ABSTRACT An investigation was made into the methods of numerically
simulating swirl jet displacement ventilation systems. Experimental
data was obtained from a quarter-scale physical model that was
ventilated using a swirl jet displacement type system. The data
was compared with results obtained from a dynamic thermal model
(DTM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation under
the same geometric configuration, flow rate and internal heat
load. The CFD solution was developed from high to low resolution
computational mesh with various solution techniques, the overall
trade-off being between computing (cpu) time and accuracy of solution.
The results showed that for any space under investigation the
accuracy of the solution is mainly dependent on the degree of
simplification and approximations involved within the solution.
When the space under investigation involves a ventilation system
that is highly complex in nature, as is the case of swirl jets,
additional modelling difficulties may occur. The three-dimensionality
of the solution may lead to misinterpretation of results if great
care is not taken.

ABSTRACT An assessment was undertaken on six different public
houses in the north of England and southern Scotland with the
aim of recognising features of their construction and operation
where environment impact had been reduced, what improvements could
be made to accommodate best environment practice, and to raise
awareness of the adverse effect of buildings on the environment.
Air quality assessments in each establishment identified potential
problems in respect of the trading design approach to ventilated
spaces. Selected environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) surrogates
(CO,NOx) were measured together with CO2 as a general air quality
indicator during a 3 month period using a photoacoustic multi-gas
analyser. All premises were installed with manually controlled
mechanical displacement ventilation systems. The traditional approach
to air quality problems arising from ETS has been one of reaction
ventilation when smoke levels were high, resulting generally in
under-ventilation of the space or, in some establishments where
the smoke problem was perceived as being high, over-ventilation
where the systems are operated continuously with a subsequent
impact on building energy use. This has been exacerbated by recent
anti-smoking lobbyists success in persuading the Environmental
Health Department of the local Councils to prosecute operators
of excessively smoky public houses.

ABSTRACT Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in residential and commercial
buildings is a topic of great interest due to the serious implications
for public health and of the considerable impact on the building
energy load due to air change. Air quality requirements are generally
and simply matched by increasing the air change rate with consequent
large increase of energy consumption. Nevertheless there exists
an alternative approach based on an optimisation of the air change
strategies and of the ventilation efficiency. Experimental and
theoretical investigations have been planned in order to achieve
these results. The experimental protocol is based on a qualitative
and quantitative evaluation of the air flow pattern and temperatures
in a well instrumented test cell adopting several ventilation
techniques and strategies. Smoke detection tracers, tracer gas
techniques and high precision anemometers are used. The air speed
and temperature map of the room give an indication on how to manage
the ventilation system. Position, dimension and set-up of the
inlet and outlet air grids in the room are changed. as well the
air flow rate and time schedule. Several test configurations are
investigated and the results obtained indicate the most suitable
set, under both viewpoints, health and energy. In parallel with
this activity a theoretical study will be carried out by means
of simulations tools, on which a preliminary validation can be
performed by means of the experimental results.

ABSTRACT This paper describes the analysis and practical testing
of a novel method of pre-heating ventilation air for buildings
by sucking the air from the cavity space in an external wall.
The fresh air introduced into the building is pre-heated partly
by recovery of the heat escaping through the inner leaf of the
wall and partly by collection of some of the solar energy incident
on the outer leaf of the wall. A classroom at Napier University
in which the system was installed was monitored to assess the
energy and comfort benefits. Consideration was also given to noise
levels and the optimum control strategy. It is concluded that
the &quot;cavity-breather&quot; method of pre-heating ventilation
air is both energy-efficient and practical.

ABSTRACT This work presents the initial activity of a research
programme performed between different UE partners. The main objective
is to develop analytical techniques and the design of building
components that will be used in low energy office buildings situated
in Northern European environment. A single prototype module of
the external wall has been proved during middle season in a test
cell sited in Catania. The component is a triple glazed ventilated
facade which integrates different passive bioclimatic solutions
such as : dynamic insulation glazing systems, solar chimneys,
reflector-diffusor of the direct beam, solar gain integrated systems.
The prototype has been investigated in terms of heating/cooling
impact and thermal performances, with different fan speeds and
external wall cavities. Test results have been utilised to validate
and to refine the analysis tools used for the evaluation of the
thermal/fluid dynamic behaviour of the module.

ABSTRACT Fields surveys of thermal comfort have been conducted
summer and winter in the five climatic regions of Pakistan to
help the Pakistani Government to replace existing inappropriate
indoor temperature standards. Results are presented which show
large variations in desired indoor temperature with climate and
season. The reasons for the differences are explored. An indication
is given of the way in which a responsive indoor temperature standard
encourages the use of passive architecture and saves energy in
air conditioned buildings.

ABSTRACT As part of the energy conservation programme of the Finnish
government, a standard method for energy auditing in buildings
has been defined. It is backed by an energy saving calculation
programme, audit report models, auditor training package and a
follow up system. The follow up results indicate that there are
low cost measures which give good savings. In auditing, it is
essential to check these first before suggesting the high cost
measures which, in spite of good savings, are not so often carried
out in practice. In the near future, a similar auditing system
is planned for the industrial sector, too, where the auditing
problems now look quite similar to those of the building sector
before the model.

ABSTRACT Although when speaking about daylighting and energy saving
the first thing that comes to mind is big commercial buildings,
considerable energy savings and interesting solutions are also
possible in residential buildings. Our research is based on the
belief that a low, compact structure maintains the energy stability
better than the classical shapes of blocks of flats. The use of
urban land is more economic,too. - The study of daylighting and
energy conscious design has been understood in the context of
the protection of the interior space and partly on the passive
use of solar energy. These principles can be shortly expressed
in four points. -uniform solar radiation of flats built-in from
three sides can be provided only with the East - West orientation
of the blocks of flats. - volume-to-space ratio must be as low
as possible. - the level of quality of daylighting in the flats
has to be considered. - the improved quality of life is an additional
bonus that can be offered to the user. On the basis of current
achievements, the deep daylighting is provided by light ducts.
The efficiency of sky light is increased by the use of highly
reflective materials in the ducts and by the sawtooth shape of
the duct wall.
