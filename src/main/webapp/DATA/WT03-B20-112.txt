<h1>Nuclear Power</h1> <p>
<p>
Nuclear power uses the energy trapped in the atoms of heavy elements like

uranium.  Splitting these atoms to form lighter elements--a process 
called
fission--causes a release of energy, which is used to boil water into 
steam.
The steam then spins a turbine, which in turn spins a generator to 
produce
electricity.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
The 109 operating nuclear power plants in the United States produce about 
21%
of the nation's electricity--only coal produces more electricity.<p>

Nuclear power plant performance is steadily improving.  In the early 
1970s,
nuclear power plants typically operated at only 50% of their total 
capacity.
Today they operate at consistently more than 70% of their capacity. <p>

Although no nuclear power plants have been ordered since 1978, many 
plants that
were under construction at that time have been completed and are now 
operating.
This steadily increased electricity generation by nuclear power and 
provided
electricity to meet increased U.S. power needs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Nuclear power--unlike fossil fuels--generates no air pollutants (such as
nitrous oxides or sulfur dioxide) or greenhouse gases, so it does not
contribute to acid rain, smog, or climate change.<p>

The nuclear and coal power plants that entered service in the last 20 
years
have cut oil use for electricity production by 1 million barrels per day,

helping reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.<p>
<p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
There are several barriers to the expanded use of nuclear power.  Among 
the
leading ones are:<p>

(1)  Delays in providing for nuclear waste management<p>
(2)  Economic competitiveness with other fuels<p>
(3)  Public concerns about safety, despite actual safety records<p>
(4)  Investment community concerns about financial risks.<p>

Waste management is one of the most difficult problems for nuclear power.  
The
technology exists for the burial of wastes from nuclear power plants and
studies are under way to test the suitability of a potential site for an
underground repository.  However, no site has been formally selected, and

reaching a final decision requires much more work.<p>

Because of the lack of a permanent waste repository, nuclear plants have
stockpiled spent fuel on site in large pools of water.  These pools were 
only
built large enough for temporary storage needs, so many are close to 
capacity,
requiring operators to look for other storage options.<p>
<p>
<h2>DOE Projects and Initiatives</h2>
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is working with the nuclear industry 
in a
cost-shared, cooperative program to develop standardized, certified 
designs for
the next generation of nuclear power plants--advanced light-water 
reactors.
These new, economic plants, incorporating improved safety features, will 
be
available for electric utility orders about the turn of the century.<p>

DOE is also making major changes in the civilian reactor waste management

program to get the program on schedule and avoid further delays.<p>
