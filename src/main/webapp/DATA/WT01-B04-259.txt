<B>Advocacy</B><BR>
           Throughout the year, the National Down Syndrome Society advocates on behalf of people with Down syndrome. The Society, bolstered by the testimony of individuals with Down syndrome, has made appearances before several House and Senate committees. Chris Burke travels worldwide to enlighten parents and professionals about the needs of people with Down syndrome and to advocate for their inclusion in community life.<P>

<CENTER><B>POSITION STATEMENT ON THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE IDEA</B></CENTER><P>

<B>ISSUE</B><P>

	The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was enacted in 1975 to end the exclusion and segregation of children with disabilities from public education programs. It provides that all children with disabilities, including Down syndrome, be educated to the maximum extent possible with students who are not disabled. IDEA supports special education, and related service programming for children and youth with disabilities and is sometimes referred to as Public Law 101-476. The IDEA was reauthorized and expanded under Public Law 94-142 in 1990.<P>

	Since the passage of Public Law 94-142, educational options for children with Down syndrome have expanded greatly. Individual Educational Plans (IEP's) are now provided for all children with special needs; parent involvement is sought; and advocacy and support is widely available. <P>

	The IDEA is up for reauthorization before the 104th Congress. Hearings and staff briefings within both houses of Congress have raised numerous issues about the law, particularly with regard to the implementation of Part B and how special education will fit in the general environment of national education reform. Questions have also been raised regarding IDEA's funding and the removal of discretionary programs such as parent training and information centers.<P>

<B>POSITION</B><P>

The National Down Syndrome Society recognizes the need for the  federal government to play an active role in overseeing access to public education for students with disabilities. Congress enacted IDEA because of the failure of states to provide an appropriate education to children with disabilities.<P>

Federal supports for individuals with disabilities and their families must be fully funded. The federal budget cannot be balanced by compromising the educational needs of students with disabilities. For students with disabilities, IDEA is a civil right to education, not a program mandated capriciously by the federal government.<P>

Research, training and technical assistance projects in IDEA must not be eliminated. They provide invaluable opportunities to educators and parents on how to effectively educate persons with developmental disabilities.<P>

Part B must not be open for revision. Part B (P.L. 94-142) of IDEA requires states to provide a free appropriate, public education for all children with disabilities. This includes special education, related programs, and supplemental aids and services necessary to sustain a child with a disability in the regular education classroom. Part B also includes important protections for children with disabilities. All of the basic and essential protections (e.g., IEP, due process, parent participation rights) of IDEA would be at risk if Part B is opened for change.<P>

The National Down Syndrome Society urges Congress to implement and rigorously enforce the provision of IDEA. This will guarantee all students with disabilities access to a free, appropriate, public education.<P>

<B><CENTER>POSITION PAPER ON MEDICAID BLOCK GRANTS</CENTER></B><P>

<B>ISSUE</B><P>
	
	Medicaid provides access to essential health care services for children with special health care needs. To qualify, children with disabilities must first meet poverty guidelines and have a disability that is on the SSI medical. Children in more than 30 states may also qualify for Medicaid through special home and community based waivers and amendments. Though family income is not always taken into account in these programs, many families, have inadequate coverage that often does not provide them the type or extent of care that they require. Medicaid has allowed children with special health care needs to receive important preventative and restorative health services while being nurtured at home by their families in their communities. <P>

	Under Medicaid regulations, any health care service approved by Medicaid which is considered medically necessary for a child must be provided. This provision allows children who are eligible for Medicaid to receive appropriate corrective and preventative services, supplies, and equipment (including assistive communication devices, durable medical goods, nutritional supplements, personal assistance, speech therapy, PT, OT, among others). <P>

	As a part of the Welfare Reform debate, proposals in both the House and Senate bills would put federal Medicaid dollars into a block grant that would go directly to states along with 4% cap on growth rate (current rate is 10%). This equates to a 30% funding reduction for each state and the abolishment of the "Medicaid Waiver" for people with developmental disabilities.<P>

<B>POSITION</B><P>

Keep federal standards in place for Medicaid. If individual states determine eligibility requirements, health care services may be significantly compromised for persons with developmental disabilities and mental retardation. <P>

Do not cut Medicaid funding for children who have chronic health care problems. Independence is the ultimate goal of health care for people with disabilities. A piece of assistive technology may make the difference between independent living or institutionalization.<P>

Do not remove the Individualized Functional Assessment (IFA) process. The IFA should be retained as part of the eligibility determination process because the real indication of severe disability is significant limitation of functional ability, rather 
than whether an impairment meets a black-and-white test of specified medical criteria.<P>

Maintain cash assistance for families of children on SSI. The SSI Children's program provides modest monthly cash benefits to eligible children who are poor and severely disabled so that they can stay at home and be raised by their families. Cash assistance is important to poor families. Families generally make informed decisions on behalf of their children, and any changes in SSI would dramatically affect a most vulnerable population. <P>

The National Down Syndrome Society urges a separate federal Medicaid block grant for long term care and financial support for children and adults with developmental disabilities. The National Down Syndrome Society also urges for the continuation of SSI benefits to families, with low incomes, who have children with severe disabilities; and the continuation of the individualized Functional Assessment to determine eligibility; accurately measuring the child's functional abilities, not their medical category.<P>
