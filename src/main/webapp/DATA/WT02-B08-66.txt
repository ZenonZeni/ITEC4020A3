<BR>
(paroxetine) <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>DESCRIPTION</B> </CENTER>
<P>Aropax 20 (paroxetine hydrochloride) is an orally administered antidepressant
with a chemical structure unrelated to other selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors or to tricyclic, tetracyclic or other available antidepressant
agents. It is the hydrochloride salt of a phenylpiperidine compound identified
chemically as (-)-<U>trans</U>-4<U>R</U>-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3<U>S</U>-[(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenoxy)methyl]-piperidine
hydrochloride hemihydrate. The molecular weight of paroxetine is 374.8 (329.4
as free base). <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="files.gif/Struct.gif" WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="212" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Paroxetine hydrochloride (CAS 61869-08-7) is an odourless, off white
powder, with a melting point range of 120 to 138C and solubility of 5.4
mg/mL in water. <BR>
<BR>
Aropax 20 tablets also contain titanium dioxide (white, E171) as colourant
and calcium hydrogen phosphate, hypromellose, starch (potato), and magnesium
stearate, polysorbate 80 and macrogols as excipients. Aropax 20 tablets
do not contain sucrose, lactose, gluten, tartrazine or any other azo dyes.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>PHARMACOLOGY </B><BR>
<BR>
Paroxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT,
serotonin) uptake and its antidepressant action and efficacy in the treatment
of OCD and Panic Disorder is thought to be related to its specific inhibition
of 5-HT uptake in brain neurones. <BR>
<BR>
<I>In vitro</I> studies have indicated that, in contrast to tricyclic anti-depressants,
paroxetine has little affinity for 1, 2 and -adrenoceptors, dopamine (D2),
5-HT1 like, 5-HT2 and histamine (H1) receptors. This lack of interaction
with post-synaptic receptors <I>in vitro </I>is substantiated by <I>in</I>
<I>vivo </I>studies which demonstrate lack of CNS depressant and hypotensive
properties. Paroxetine has low affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors
and animal studies have indicated only weak anticholinergic properties.
<BR>
<BR>
Because the relative potencies of paroxetine's major metabolites are at
most 1/50 of the parent compound, it is most unlikely that they contribute
to paroxetine's therapeutic effect. <BR>
<BR>
As with other selective 5-HT uptake inhibitors, paroxetine causes symptoms
of excessive 5-HT receptor stimulation when administered to animals previously
given monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or tryptophan. Behavioural and
EEG studies indicate that paroxetine is weakly activating at doses generally
above those required to inhibit 5-HT uptake. The activating properties are
not &quot;amphetamine-like&quot; in nature. <BR>
<BR>
Paroxetine does not impair psychomotor function and does not potentiate
the depressant effects of ethanol. <BR>
<BR>
Animal studies indicate that paroxetine is well tolerated by the cardiovascular
system, and in healthy subjects paroxetine produces no clinically significant
changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ECG. <BR>
<BR>
In the treatment of depressive disorders, Aropax 20 exhibits comparable
efficacy to standard antidepressants. There is also some evidence that paroxetine
may be of therapeutic value in patients who have failed to respond to standard
therapy. <BR>
<BR>
In general, improvement in patients starts after one week but does not become
superior to placebo until the second week of therapy. Aropax 20 is effective
in improving depression and suicidal ideation concurrently during the first
few weeks of therapy. <BR>
<BR>
Morning dosing with paroxetine does not have any detrimental effect on either
the quality or duration of sleep. Moreover, patients are likely to experience
improved sleep as they respond to paroxetine therapy. Where it is clinical
practice to co-prescribe short-acting hypnotics with antidepressants, no
additional adverse events have been recorded. <BR>
<BR>
Aropax 20, in addition to its significant antidepressant effects, can improve
associated symptoms of anxiety. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Clinical Trials</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Relapse prevention of depression</B> <BR>
<BR>
*A study of depressed outpatients who had responded to Aropax 20 (HAM D
total score <U>&lt;</U>8) during an initial 8-week open-treatment phase
and were then randomised to continuation on Aropax 20 or placebo for 1 year
demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate for patients taking Aropax
20 (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</B> <BR>
<BR>
*The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12 week placebo-controlled studies
(Studies 1 and 2). The results of a third placebo-controlled study (study
3) support the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD. <BR>
<BR>
*Study 1 was a dose-ranging study which originally consisted of 348 patients
with OCD and compared placebo, 20mg, 40mg or 60mg daily. Of these 348 patients,
338 had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation and were included
in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population for efficacy analyses. Paroxetine
40mg and 60mg/day were significantly superior to placebo (p&lt;0.001) in
the treatment of OCD as assessed by the primary efficacy variable, mean
change from baseline in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (YBOCS)
total score. Significant improvement was noted from week 6 onwards. <BR>
<BR>
*Studies 2 and 3 were flexible dose studies comparing paroxetine (20 to
60 mg daily) with clomipramine (25 to 250mg daily). In Study 2, conducted
in 399 patients, 391 had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation
and were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population for efficacy analyses.
Paroxetine was significantly more effective than placebo as assessed by
the primary efficacy variables mean change from baseline in YBOCS total
score (p=0.002). In addition, the efficacy of paroxetine was comparable
to that of clomipramine in this study. In study 3, conducted in 241 patients,
232 had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation and were included
in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population for efficacy analyses. There was
a numerically better response in paroxetine treated patients compared to
placebo in the mean change from baseline in YBOCS total score, the magnitude
of which was comparable to that in study 2, though this did not reach statistical
significance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Relapse prevention of OCD</B> <BR>
<BR>
*A study of OCD outpatients, who had responded to Aropax 20 during an initial
6 month open-treatment phase and were then randomised to continuation on
Aropax 20 or placebo for 6 months demonstrated a significantly lower relapse
rate for patients taking Aropax 20 (38%) compared to those on placebo (59%).
The risk ratio assessment conducted in this study showed that patients randomised
to placebo were 2.7 times more likely to experience a relapse compared to
those patients who continued on paroxetine treatment (p=0.001). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Panic Disorder</B> <BR>
<BR>
*The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of Panic Disorder was
demonstrated in four multicentre, placebo controlled studies of adult outpatients.
Patients in all studies had Panic Disorder (DSM III-R) with or without agoraphobia.
The studies were conducted over 10-12 weeks. Two of these studies also had
an active comparator (clomipramine or alprazolam) arm. In all four studies,
patients received either paroxetine 10-60 mg/day (n=469), clomipramine 10-150
mg/day (n=121), alprazolam 1-6mg/day (n=77) or placebo (n=324). These studies
indicated that paroxetine was superior to placebo and comparable with active
comparator. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Pharmacokinetics</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
Paroxetine is well absorbed after oral dosing and undergoes first-pass metabolism.
As a consequence the amount of paroxetine available to the systemic circulation
is less than that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Partial saturation
of the first-pass effect and reduced plasma clearance occur as the body
burden increases, with higher single dosing or on multiple dosing. This
results in disproportionate increases in plasma concentrations of paroxetine
and hence pharmacokinetic parameters are not constant, resulting in non-linear
kinetics. However, the non-linearity is generally small and is confined
to those subjects who achieve low plasma levels at low doses. <BR>
<BR>
Paroxetine is distributed throughout the body including the CNS. Approximately
95% of the paroxetine present in the plasma is protein bound at therapeutic
concentrations. <BR>
<BR>
Paroxetine is extensively metabolised after oral administration. The principal
metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation,
which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate,
and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that
the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound
at inhibiting serotonin uptake. <BR>
<BR>
Approximately 64% of the dose is excreted in the urine; urinary excretion
of unchanged paroxetine is generally less than 2% of dose. About 36% of
the dose is excreted in the faeces, probably via the bile; faecal excretion
of unchanged paroxetine represents less than 1% of the dose. Thus paroxetine
is eliminated almost entirely by metabolism. Metabolite excretion is biphasic,
being initially a result of first pass metabolism and subsequently controlled
by systemic elimination of paroxetine. <BR>
<BR>
The elimination half life is variable but is generally about 1 day. Steady
state systemic levels are attained by 7-14 days after starting treatment
and pharmacokinetics do not appear to change during long-term therapy. Considerable
variation can occur in the plasma concentrations achieved between individuals,
possibly due to variable first pass effect and variability in clearance.
<BR>
<BR>
No correlation has been found between paroxetine plasma concentrations and
clinical effect (adverse experiences and efficacy). <BR>
<BR>
Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in elderly subjects
and in those subjects with severe renal and hepatic impairment, but the
range of plasma concentrations overlaps that of healthy adult subjects.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>INDICATIONS</B> <BR>
<BR>
Aropax 20 is indicated for the treatment of major depression and is effective
in preventing the relapse of depressive symptoms. <BR>
<BR>
*Aropax 20 is also indicated for the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
and the symptomatic treatment of Panic Disorder. <BR>
<BR>
<B>CONTRAINDICATIONS</B> <BR>
<BR>
Aropax 20 is contraindicated in persons who are known to be hypersensitive
to paroxetine or any of its components (see DESCRIPTION). <BR>
<BR>
Concomitant use in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
(see PRECAUTIONS). <BR>
<BR>
<B>PRECAUTIONS</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):</B> As with most antidepressants,
paroxetine should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or within
2 weeks of terminating treatment with MAO inhibitors. Thereafter treatment
should be initiated cautiously and dosage increased gradually until optimal
response is reached. <BR>
<BR>
MAO inhibitors should not be introduced within 2 weeks of cessation of therapy
with paroxetine. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Activation of Mania/Hypomania: </B>As with all antidepressants, paroxetine
should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or hypomania.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Oral Anticoagulants: </B>Paroxetine should be administered with great
caution to patients receiving oral anticoagulants. (see INTERACTIONS) <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tryptophan: </B>As adverse experiences have been reported when tryptophan
was administered with another selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, paroxetine
should not be used in combination with tryptophan medication. (see INTERACTIONS)
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cardiac Conditions: *</B>The usual precautions should be observed in
patients with cardiac conditions. There is limited experience concerning
the use of paroxetine in patients with recent myocardial infarction or unstable
heart disease. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Epilepsy: </B>As with other antidepressants, paroxetine should be used
with caution in patients with epilepsy or history of convulsive disorders.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Seizures: </B>Overall the incidence of seizures is &lt;0.15% in patients
treated with paroxetine. The drug should be discontinued in any patient
who develops seizures. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ECT:<I> </I></B>The efficacy and safety of the concurrent use of Aropax
20 and ECT have not been studied. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cognitive and Motor Performance: </B>Clinical experience has shown that
therapy with paroxetine is not associated with impairment of cognitive or
psychomotor function. However, as with all psychoactive drugs, patients
should be cautioned about their ability to drive a car and operate machinery.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alcohol: </B>Although paroxetine does not increase the mental and motor
skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of paroxetine and
alcohol in patients is not advised. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
In two year studies conducted in mice and rats, paroxetine had no tumourigenic
effect and no genotoxicity effects were observed in a battery of <I>in vitro
</I>and <I>in vivo</I> tests. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Impairment of Fertility</B>: Serotonergic compounds are known to affect
reproductive function in animals. Impaired reproductive function (ie reduced
pregnancy rate, increased pre- and post-implantation losses, decreased viability
of pups) was found in the reproduction studies in rats at doses of 13mg
paroxetine/kg and above. Vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium and
atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested
spermatogenesis occurred in male rats at doses of 25mg/kg/day in toxicity
studies. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Use in Pregnancy (Category B3)</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to
43 and 5mg/kg, respectively, have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects.
Studies in rats have shown increased pre- and post-implantation losses and
decreased postnatal survival at dose levels producing maternal toxicity.
There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,
this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Use in Lactation</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
The concentrations of paroxetine detected in the breast milk of lactating
women are similar to those in plasma. Neonatal mortality was increased in
the offspring of rats receiving paroxetine 13 and 43mg/kg/day PO during
pregnancy and lactation. The risk to the infant by paroxetine administration
to lactating women is unknown. Breast feeding should be discontinued if
the use of paroxetine by the mother is thought necessary. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Interactions</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
The absorption and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are not affected by food
or antacids. Paroxetine has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics
of a wide range of drugs, including digoxin, propranolol and warfarin. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Warfarin</B> <BR>
<BR>
A pharmacodynamic interaction between paroxetine and warfarin may exist.
This may result in increased bleeding. Paroxetine should therefore be administered
with great caution to patients receiving oral anticoagulants. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism</B> <BR>
<BR>
The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the
induction or inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes. For example cimetidine,
a known drug metabolising enzyme inhibitor, can increase the bioavailability
of paroxetine whereas phenytoin, a known drug metabolising enzyme inducer,
can decrease it. <BR>
<BR>
When paroxetine is to be co-administered with a known drug metabolising
enzyme inhibitor, consideration should be given to using doses at the lower
end of the range. No initial dosage adjustment is considered necessary when
the drug is to be coadministered with known drug metabolising enzyme inducers.
Any subsequent dosage adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability
and efficacy). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Phenytoin</B>: Co-administration of paroxetine and phenytoin is associated
with decreased plasma concentrations of paroxetine and increased adverse
experiences. No initial dosage adjustments of paroxetine are considered
necessary when these drugs are co-administered, any subsequent adjustments
should be guided by clinical effect. Co-administration of paroxetine with
other anticonvulsants may also be associated with an increased incidence
of adverse experiences. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Drugs Metabolised by Cytochrome P450IID6</B> <BR>
<BR>
As with other antidepressants, including other SSRIs, paroxetine inhibits
the specific hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism
of debrisoquine and sparteine. This may lead to enhanced plasma levels of
those co-administered drugs which are metabolised by this isoenzyme, although
the clinical significance of this observation has not been established.
<BR>
<BR>
Drugs metabolised by the isoenzyme include certain tricyclic antidepressants
(eg. nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine and desipramine), phenothiazine
neuroleptics (eg. perphenazine, thioridazine) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics
(eg. flecainide). <BR>
<BR>
Because the effects of concomitant use of paroxetine with neuroleptics and
tricyclic antidepressants have not been studied, co-administration of these
agents with paroxetine should be approached with caution. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Procyclidine</B> <BR>
<BR>
Daily administration of paroxetine increases significantly the plasma levels
of procyclidine. If anti-cholinergic effects are seen, the dose of procyclidine
should be reduced. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Psychotropic Agents</B> <BR>
<BR>
A study of the interaction between paroxetine and diazepam showed no alteration
in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine that would warrant changes in the
dose of paroxetine for patients receiving both drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Experience in a limited number of healthy subjects has shown that paroxetine
does not increase the sedation and drowsiness associated with haloperidol,
amylobarbitone or oxazepam, when given in combination. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors:</B> see CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tryptophan </B>can be metabolised to serotonin. Therefore, the use of
Aropax 20 together with tryptophan may result in adverse reactions including
agitation, restlessness and gastrointestinal distress. (see PRECAUTIONS)
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lithium: </B>In a study in depressed patients stabilised on lithium,
no pharmacokinetic interaction between paroxetine and lithium was observed.
However, since there is little clinical experience, the concurrent administration
of paroxetine and lithium should be undertaken with caution. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Alcohol: </B>See PRECAUTIONS <BR>
<BR>
<B>ADVERSE EFFECTS</B> <BR>
<BR>
Adverse experiences with paroxetine are generally mild in nature and do
not affect the patient's life-style. Adverse experiences may decrease in
intensity and frequency with continued treatment and do not generally lead
to cessation of therapy. *13% of paroxetine (n=2963) treated patients in
worldwide short term clinical trials for depression, discontinued treatment
due to an adverse experience, compared to 5% receiving placebo (n=554).
*In addition, 11.8% (64/542) and 9.4% (44/462) of paroxetine patients withdrew
from worldwide trials in OCD (vs placebo, 21/265, 7.9%) and Panic Disorder
(vs placebo, 32/324, 9.9%), respectively. <BR>
<BR>
The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine
in clinical trials and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo
treated patients were: nausea, somnolence, sweating, tremor, asthenia, dry
mouth, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, constipation, diarrhoea,
and decreased appetite. <BR>
<BR>
Paroxetine is less likely than tricyclic antidepressants to be associated
with dry mouth, constipation and somnolence. <BR>
<BR>
The following adverse events were observed during the clinical trial programmes
for depression, OCD and Panic Disorder. All adverse experiences are included
in the list except those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative
and those experiences for which the drug cause was remote. It should however
be noted that causality has not necessarily been established, and that patients
enrolled in the clinical trials may have been generally healthier than the
general patient population. <BR>
<BR>
Events are listed within body systems and categorised by frequency according
to the following definitions: common events reported at a frequency of greater
or equal to 1/100 patients; uncommon events reported at a frequency of less
than 1/100 but greater or equal to 1/1,000 patients; rare events reported
at a frequency of less than 1/1,000 patients. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
*The following adverse events have been reported rarely: dizziness, rash,
acute glaucoma, urinary retention, peripheral and facial oedema, tachycardia,
thrombocytopenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and symptoms suggestive
of hyperprolactinaemia/galactorrhoea. <BR>
<BR>
Hyponatraemia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, and
in some cases may be associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone secretion (SIADH). The hyponatraemia generally reverses on discontinuation
of paroxetine. <BR>
<BR>
*Elevation of hepatic enzymes has been reported. Serious liver abnormalities
have been reported rarely. Discontinuation of paroxetine should be considered
if there is prolonged elevation of liver function test results. <BR>
<BR>
Occasional reports of extrapyramidal disorders including oro-facial dystonia
have been received in patients sometimes with underlying movement disorders
or who were using neuroleptic medication. <BR>
<BR>
*Abnormal bleeding (mostly ecchymosis and purpura) has been reported following
paroxetine<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> </FONT>treatment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Discontinuation Effects</B> <BR>
<BR>
As with many psychoactive medicines, abrupt discontinuation may lead to
symptoms such as dizziness, sensory disturbances, sleep disturbances, tremor,
agitation or anxiety, nausea and sweating. <BR>
<BR>
<B>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</B> <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Depression</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
The recommended dose of Aropax 20 is 20mg (1 tablet) daily.<I> </I>Many
patients will respond to a 20mg daily dose.<I> </I>Patients not responding
to a 20 mg dose may benefit from dose increases in 10mg/day increments,
up to a maximum of 50mg/day according to the patient's response. It is recommended
that paroxetine is administered once daily in the morning with food. The
tablet should be swallowed rather than chewed. <BR>
<BR>
As with all antidepressant drugs, dosage should be reviewed and adjusted
if necessary within 2 to 3 weeks of initiation of therapy and thereafter
as judged clinically appropriate. Dose changes should occur at intervals
of at least 1 week. <BR>
<BR>
It is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant drug treatment
should continue for a sufficient period, often for several months. There
is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the
patient treated with paroxetine should remain on it. It is generally agreed
that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained
drug therapy. Whether the dose of an antidepressant needed to induce remission
is identical to the dose needed to maintain or sustain euthymia is unknown.
<BR>
<BR>
Systematic evaluation of paroxetine hydrochloride has shown that efficacy
was maintained for periods up to one year. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
*The recommended dose of Aropax 20 is 40mg (2 tablets) daily. Patients should
start on 20mg and the dose can be increased weekly in 10mg increments. Some
patients will benefit from having their dose increased up to a maximum of
60mg/day. <BR>
<BR>
It is recommended that paroxetine is administered once daily in the morning
with food. The tablet should be swallowed rather than chewed. <BR>
<BR>
*Patients with OCD should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that
they are free from symptoms. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Panic Disorder</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
*The recommended dose is 40mg daily. Patients should be started on 10mg/day
and the dose increased weekly in 10mg increments according to patient's
response. Some patients may benefit from having their dose increased up
to a maximum of 60mg/day. It is recommended that paroxetine is administered
once daily in the morning with food. The tablet should be swallowed rather
than chewed. <BR>
<BR>
*A low starting dose and slow dosage increase reduce the risk of an initial
transient increase in anxiety which is generally recognised to occur early
in the treatment of this disorder. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Use in the Elderly</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in elderly subjects,
but the range of concentrations overlaps with that observed in younger subjects.
Dosing should commence at the<U> </U>adult starting dose and may be increased
up to 40mg daily. Dosing should not exceed 40mg daily. <BR>
<BR>
Elderly patients should be initiated and maintained at the lowest daily
dosage of paroxetine which is associated with clinical efficacy. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Use in Children</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
The use of paroxetine in children is not recommended as safety and efficacy
have not been established in this population. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Use in Renal/Hepatic Impairment</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severe
renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) or severe hepatic
impairment. Therefore, dosage should be restricted to the lower end of the
dosage range in patients with clinically significant hepatic or renal impairment.
<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Discontinuation of Treatment</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
Discontinuation effects have been noted 1 to 4 days after abrupt cessation.
Aropax 20 should not normally be discontinued abruptly. *When Aropax 20
is to be discontinued, the dose should be tapered. As with many psychoactive
medicines, abrupt discontinuation may lead to symptoms such as dizziness,
sensory disturbances, sleep disturbances, tremor, agitation or anxiety,
nausea and sweating. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Prolonged Treatment</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
The physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended period should periodically
re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>OVERDOSAGE</B> <BR>
<BR>
Overdose attempts have been reported with paroxetine (up to 850mg) alone
and in combination with other agents. In cases where paroxetine was used
alone, no deaths have occurred and recovery was medically uneventful. <BR>
<BR>
As with all overdose attempts, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion
should be borne in mind. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Symptoms</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
Symptoms of overdose with paroxetine include nausea, vomiting, tremor, dilated
pupils, dry mouth and irritability. There are no reports of coma or convulsions
following overdosage with paroxetine alone. <BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Treatment</U></B> <BR>
<BR>
No specific antidote is known. Treatment should consist of those general
measures employed in the management of overdose with any antidepressant.
<BR>
<BR>
The stomach should be emptied either by the induction of emesis, lavage
or both. Following evacuation, 20 to 30 grams of activated charcoal may
be administered every 4 to 6 hours during the first 24 hours after ingestion.
Supportive care with frequent monitoring of vital signs and careful observation
is indicated. <BR>
<BR>
<B>STORAGE</B> <BR>
<BR>
