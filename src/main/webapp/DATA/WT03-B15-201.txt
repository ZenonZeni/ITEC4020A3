<H1>British Gas Research and Technology Division - Design of an intelligent test rig for pre-paid gas metering schemes</H1> 


<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>
<P>British Gas are the UK's primary commercial and domestic gas supplier. For many years they have installed coin-operated gas meters to meet the needs of certain customers. Because these meters hold coins, they have proved to be targets for vandalism and theft. British Gas Research and technology division have therefore developed several schemes for meters which use plastic keys, magnetic strip cards and smart cards as a credit medium.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>
<P>A test rig had to be implemented to assess the reliability of the payment schemes outlined above before embarking on a nation-wide installation programme.</P>

<P>The test rig had to pick up the keys or cards from feeds, then insert and remove them from the meters. In the case of the cards, it was necessary to place each one into a card programming device first. All results were to be logged automatically on a PC.</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>

<P>The first step in the design of the test rig was to use Workspace to try out various layout ideas and compare the performance of different robots for the application.</P>

<P>The robot, gas meter, card programmer, feeding mechanism and other components were all modelled using the simulation's integrated CAD system. then, several different industrial robots were placed in the Workspace computer model and tested. The most appropriate layout was quickly found by comparing the times for one complete test cycle.</P>

<P>After evaluation on the simulator, an Alpha2 robot was chosen as the ideal robot. The robot was subsequently purchased and the test rig was built.</P>

<H2>British Gas' financial justification for Workspace</H2>

<P>Simulation using Workspace enabled different robots to be evaluated for the task before purchase.</P>

<P>The test rig was built on a "right first time" basis.</P>

<P>Workspace prevented costly mistakes during the development of the project.</P>
