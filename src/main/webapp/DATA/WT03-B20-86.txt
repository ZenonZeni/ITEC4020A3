Wind energy is currently viewed as one of the most promising of the 
renewable energy sources, with an enormous resource in the 
British Isles and a steadily maturing technology base in Europe 
and North America.  Wind turbines deployed in single units, in 
small groups of four or five, and increasingly in wind farms of 
up to fifty machines, are becoming a feature on the landscape of 
many European countries, especially Denmark, the Netherlands, 
northern Germany, and now Spain and Britain.  In three areas of 
California (Altamont, Tehachapi and San Gorgonio) wind farming 
developed on a massive scale in the 1980s with well over 15000 
machines now installed.  But what does this renewable technology 
involve, and how much of a contribution can it actually make to 
the UK electricity supply industry?  This two hour lecture will 
give a picture of the present state of this technology and 
describe current trends in its application.
<p>


<h2>Technology I</h2><p>

The most distinctive feature of a wind turbine is its <b>rotor</b>, 
converting the fluid mechanical energy of the wind to rotational 
energy in the main shaft.  Most modern machines work by 
developing aerodynamic lift from the air flow; this is created 
by the suction caused on the <b>blade</b> by the acceleration of the 
air over it, along the same principle as an aircraft wing.  Any 
aerodynamic force is proportional to the square of the incident 
air speed.  For the <b>horizontal-axis</b> wind turbine (HAWT), where 
the axis of the rotor is parallel to the wind direction, the 
angle of attack at any point along the blade is more-or-less 
constant for a given wind speed.  Up to the stall point, the 
lift force created is proportional to this angle of attack.  The 
rotor driving force is largely made up of the in-plane component 
of the lift along the blade, but the out-of-plane component 
causes a thrust load on the rotor, tending to bend the blades 
and blow the turbine over.  Put very simply: it is the in-plane 
component of force which 'brings in the money' since it 
determines the driving torque, but the thrust load 'costs the 
money' since it determines the strength requirement and to a 
large extent the fatigue life of the machine.  For the 
<b>vertical-axis</b> configuration (VAWT), where the rotor axis is 
perpendicular to the wind stream, the angle of attack at any 
point on the blade varies in time, so the aerodynamic power and 
loads are unsteady.  Although this is a complication, the 
vertical-axis wind turbine does have the advantage of not 
requiring re-alignment with the wind when its direction changes.<p>

The power of a wind turbine is proportional to the swept area of 
its rotor, and at a typical site about 500W per square metre 
would be the upper limit of what could be expected from any 
machine.  Machines vary in <b>size</b> from 600mm diameter, rated at 
about 50W, to 60m diameter, rated at about 3MW.  The 'best' size 
for a turbine for a particular application will be a topic we 
shall return to later.  The main components of a turbine are 
illustrated in the

that drawing.
A wide variety of 
materials have been used for blade manufacture, including glass 
fibre on a foam core, glass-reinforced polyester (GRP), 
wood/epoxy laminate, and steel.  The <b>number of blades</b> (4) on a 
rotor is to some extent dependent on size, with two blades being 
generally preferred on larger machines, and three blades for 
machines under 500kW.  For a two-bladed rotor there would be a 
cost reduction associated with the reduced rotor weight, and a 
reduced gearbox cost because of the higher running speed; but 
the three-bladed rotor produces slightly more power and 'looks 
better'.  The increased tip speed of a two-blader might also 
cause increased aerodynamic noise.  On some HAWTs the rotor is 
placed <b>downwind</b> of the tower to improve the <b>yaw</b> behaviour of the 
rotor - its ability to track the wind as its direction changes 
- and improve the clearance between tower and blades under load; 
but an <b>upwind rotor</b> does not have the disadvantage of operating 
through the disturbed air flow behind the tower, with the 
associated aerodynamic noise penalty that would bring.<p>

Rotational speed is roughly inversely proportional to rotor 
diameter, so as to give a blade tip speed somewhere between 
50m/s (smaller machines) and 100m/s (larger machines).  The 
rotor <b>main shaft</b> (2), which will often carry a <b>disc brake</b> (5), 
transmits the torque to the <b>gearbox</b> (not numbered in the 
drawing, but located under the brake <b>hydraulic unit</b> (7)).  On 
larger machines (MW scale) a planetary gearbox is often used for 
reasons of weight and size, but for smaller (kW scale) machines 
a simpler parallel shaft gearbox is often preferred.  The 
<b>generator</b> (6) will commonly be of the simple induction type, 
providing damping to the transmission system; the alternative 
synchronous type has the advantage of being excited from the 
grid, but demands precise rotor speed control for synchronising 
at start up.  The function of the <b>controller</b> is to match the 
output of the wind turbine generator (WTG) to the wind available 
and to the power demand; an important function on a HAWT is to 
change the orientation of the turbine, via a <b>yaw drive</b> (8), to 
match the wind direction.  All of this equipment will be mounted 
in a <b>nacelle</b> to provide protection from the elements, but access 
will always be required for maintenance.<p>

The rotor and nacelle are mounted atop a <b>tower</b>, nowadays often of 
tubular steel construction but many lattice towers can still be 
seen supporting earlier WTGs; guyed pole towers are an option 
for VAWTs and for smaller HAWTs.  The height of the tower is a 
trade-off between the benefits of catching the 'better' wind at 
some height above ground level versus the increased 
bending moment at the base.  The <b>foundations</b> must not only 
withstand the bending moment arising from the thrust load on the 
rotor, but also cope with any vibrations arising from the 
rotational frequency.  On any given site, the solid rock from 
which the foundations are built may be many metres below the 
surface.  These civil engineering aspects of the project then 
raise the whole question of WTG <b>installation</b>.  For a larger 
machine (over say 100kW) the tower will be built up on site from 
sections fabricated elsewhere, but the nacelle (possibly 
weighing several tons) must be hoisted to the top and the blades 
mounted at the hub.  This would require a large crane, which is 
usually expensive and, if the terrain is very rough, impossible 
to deploy.  An alternative method of installation would require 
some kind of hoisting from the ground, necessitating 'hard 
points' on both the nacelle and on the site.  The volume and 
weight of the WTG and installation equipment may be such as to 
demand the construction of <b>access roads</b> to the site, depending 
on the nature of the terrain and the distances involved; such a 
road network could add substantially to the total cost of a wind 
energy project.<p>

For operational convenience, the monitoring and control panel 
will be located at the base of the tower, within the shelter of 
the tubular tower itself.  Power cables, possibly under ground, 
will lead from the base of the tower to a <b>transformer station</b>; 
in a wind farm consisting of a number of WTGs, a local network 
of distribution points will be installed, leading eventually to 
the electricity utility's nearest <b>substation</b> where the 
connection to the grid is made.  Cabling costs to a very remote 
site could easily outweigh the benefit to income of even a most 
favourable wind regime.  Although by no means essential 
equipment at a wind farm site, the use of <b>anemometry</b> to measure 
wind speed could give the operator useful performance indicators 
on individual turbines and the farm as a whole.<p>

This then has been a first look at what the technology involves; 
we shall return to the subject again after giving some attention 
to the wind itself, both as the bountiful resource and the 
hostile environment.<p>


<h2>The Wind</h2><p>
<p>
The local wind speed is the most important parameter for a 
prospective site.  The energy in the wind is proportional to the 
cube of the wind speed (its force - or more precisely its 
pressure - multiplied by its velocity), so the energy yield of 
the proposed WTG is most sensitive to the site wind speed.  
Since the wind is continually varying, we use the <b>mean annual 
wind speed</b> (MAWS) to give a broad indication of the site's 
potential.  Generally the windy parts of Europe are the Western 
and Northern coastal regions, but of course the regional 
landscape and local topography affect this picture greatly.  The 
mistral winds of southern France and the seasonal winds over the 
islands of Greece are a distinctive exception to this broad 
rule.  The <a href="atlas.gif">map (size 70kb)</a>

The map is

appropriate topographic conditions must be selected from the following 
table to give an indication of the regional wind resource.
By means of this table, the available wind energy can be estimated at the height of 50m for four topographic conditions.  (Regions where local concentration effects may occur are not indicated.  Such regions are expected to exist in the United Kingdom, Fr
ance, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece.)<p>

<p>
All 
the well-exposed hills and ridges of mainland Scotland, the 
Western Isles, the Orkney Isles, and the Shetland Isles have a 
MAWS greater than 12m/s and an energy density greater than 2kW 
per square metre.  As will be discussed in the final chapter, 
current wind farm developments in the UK are concentrated on the 
good sites of Cornwall, Wales, Cumbria, and the East coast 
regions of England, with MAWSs greater than 7m/s.  The 
'technical potential wind energy resource' for the UK has been 
conservatively estimated (Ref 2) to be 45 TWh/y, around 15% of 
annual electricity supply.<p>
<p>
As has been mentioned earlier, the wind varies (in both speed 
and direction) with height above ground level, as in any 
boundary layer flow.  This <b>wind shear</b> effect can be quite 
significant for a large WTG (more than 20m diameter), in 
providing a wind pressure gradient across the rotor disc; the 
loading on a turbine blade will fluctuate periodically as it 
rotates.  The wind shear profile is often assumed to follow a 
'one seventh power law', but the reality can be significantly 
different where for example a hill top causes a local 
acceleration of the wind.  The wind speeds given in the European 
wind atlas are quoted for a reference height of 50m above 
ground, which is representative of the hub height of a MW scale 
wind turbine; standard UK Meteorological Office data is quoted 
for a height of 10m, which is therefore probably an 
under-estimate of the hub-height wind speed.  Historical records 
of wind speed at the Cranfield control tower anemometer indicate 
a MAWS of around 4m/s which is rather less than the 6-7m/s 
suggested by the wind atlas.<p>
<p>
<b>Variations of wind speed</b> occur over a wide range of time scales.  
Some years are windier than others, and there may well be an 
historical trend of changing wind speeds.  Seasonal variations 
are marked, even for the temperate climate of Northern Europe; 
the monsoons of SE Asia for example would place critical 
loadings on a WTG.  The variations associated with the passage 
of weather systems over the site have a time scale of around 
three days.  Diurnal variations also have an implication for 
wind power production: when the wind dies down in the late 
afternoon, other grid-connected sources are required to provide 
the power for the early evening peak demand.  Our personal 
experience of the wind, standing on the top of an exposed hill 
for instance, tells us that second-by-second variations can be 
very considerable.  This variability is caused by turbulent 
eddies in the flow, generated by thermal gradients and 
topographic features.  Wind <b>gusting</b> superimposes random blade 
vibrations on top of the periodic oscillations due to wind shear; 
fluctuations in rotor torque impose severe demands on the wind 
turbine gearbox and could mean that the electrical power quality 
is unacceptable to the utility.  For the estimation of 
structural excitation and fatigue damage, it is often useful to 
use a spectral approach to the wind variability, considered as 
continuous <b>turbulence</b>.<p>

<!-- PICTURE
     CAPTION A turbine in a turbulent wind.
     DETAILS The figure illustrates the fact that "atmospheric turbulence causes important fluctuating aerodynamic forces on wind turbines - the stress and power output fluctuations of a wind turbine are strongly a function of both the rotation of the rot
or and the moment-by-moment variations of turbulent wind velocity in both space and time".

             -->

It can be seen, therefore, that associated with high wind speeds 
are various harmful effects of great concern to the wind turbine 
manufacturer.  To first order, turbulence levels are 
proportional to the wind speed - levels of 20% are not atypical 
for good sites.  Sites in mountainous regions may have quite 
excellent average wind speeds, but the air is so churned up by 
the terrain itself that the turbulent loadings demand a costly 
'over-design' to a number of critical components.  Simply 
because the wind turbine is placed high up on a tower it will be 
exposed to the worst of driving rain.  In Northern regions, and 
at high altitudes, the precipitation comes down as snow and 
forms ice.  In coastal regions, the wind turbine must be 
protected against the corrosive effects of sea water.  And at 
the other extreme, in the deserts of California, temperatures 
are very high, and sand erosion and dust penetration are 
important problems.  These elements form the hostile environment 
in which a WTG must operate.<p>


<h2>Technology II</h2><p>

The target lifetime for a wind turbine is generally 20 years.  
Since they are intended for installation in remote and exposed 
areas, maintenance will be both costly and limited.  On-site 
inspections of many components can be carried out regularly, but 
failed components will be replaced rather than repaired.  
Sophisticated examination procedures cannot be carried out 
on-site, and specialist repairs (to the gearbox for example) 
must be carried out at the factory.  Problems with the rotor 
(blades and hub) are likely to be costly since they will require 
access and possibly removal.  Elaborate monitoring 
instrumentation (over and above basic operational status and 
power production) on every machine in a wind farm would add 
significantly to the total project cost.<p>

Component fatigue is obviously a major concern to a 
manufacturer, and very roughly speaking the <b>stochastic loading</b> 
associated with turbulence accounts for 50% of the fatigue 
damage on the rotor.  But for a HAWT, particularly vulnerable 
components are the yaw drive and yaw brake which take a lot of 
punishment especially on turbulent sites.  Continual wind 
veering means that for a large proportion of the time the rotor 
is misaligned to the wind, resulting in loss of power, increased 
blade bending moments, and torque at the yaw axis.  It has been 
found counter-productive to make the yaw controller too active 
in following the wind direction changes, since that in itself 
can significantly increase fatigue damage.  Any kind of 
imbalance in the rotor can also add to the vibratory loading on 
the yaw drive.<p>

The variability of the wind also raises the need for power 
control.  Power cannot be allowed to increase much beyond the <b>
rated power</b>  of the machine because of the risk of damage to the 
gearbox and generator.  There are three methods of power control 
in wide use.  <b>Full-blade pitch control</b> provides a mechanism for 
varying the pitch angle of each blade so as to reduce the angle 
of attack in high winds; the hub of a pitch-controlled HAWT is 
quite complicated and the actuator system must have enough power 
to rotate the whole blade.  A simpler solution is <b>tip control</b> 
where only the outer 20% (say) of the blade is rotated.  The

             -->
shows power versus wind speed (m/s) of a 
tip-controlled rotor - the measured mean power over each 10 
minute interval has been normalised by the rated power of 330kW.  
The hub and blade root details of a tip-controlled HAWT will be 
simpler than for full-blade pitch control; maintenance of the 
actuator and tip bearings of a tip-regulated blade can be done 
from an access door half way up the tower with the blade at 
bottom-dead-centre.<p>

<b>Stall regulation</b> on the other hand, relies on the inherent 
aerodynamic stalling of the aerofoil sections to limit the power 
in high winds, and so in principal is the simplest and cheapest 
method of power control to engineer.  The 
<a href="stallperf.gif"> next figure (size 21kb)</a> shows

             -->
a similarly-treated power curve for a stall-regulated HAWT, this 
time normalised for a maximum power of 125kW; actually this 
turbine is rated by the manufacturer at 108kW, which illustrates 
the problem of over-production for stall-regulated turbines.  
Stall-regulated rotors must also have small, pitchable tips 
fitted to provide aerodynamic braking in an emergency if the 
rotor should over-speed (when the mechanical brake would be 
unable to stop the rotor).  Most small WTGs (under say 150kW) 
are stall-regulated; there is some interest in simplifying the 
rotors of larger machines by using stall-control, if only there 
was confidence that the power would actually be limited.<p>

<b>Variable speed</b> control aims to continuously vary the rotor speed 
with the wind speed so as to keep the ratio of the two constant 
for optimum rotor efficiency.  The necessary AC-DC-AC inverter 
links have now been developed to make this a possibility.  An 
innovative German manufacturer has now developed a variable 
speed WTG without gearbox, using a directly-coupled large rim 
generator.<p>

The point has been made earlier about the desirability of 
simplifying the rotor for the sake of <b>reliability and 
maintainability</b>.  Indeed, the achievement of <b>simplicity</b> has 
become something of a creed in the wind industry, with the 
widespread view that the more complicated a component is made 
(often for the purpose of increasing energy capture), the less 
reliable and more difficult to maintain and repair it will be.  
By far the biggest proportion of reported component failures is 
to the electrical control system.  Failure of the grid itself is 
not infrequent and will result in the WTG shutting down.  
Failures on the rotor are significant and, as has already been 
mentioned, are generally difficult to correct.  Problems with 
the specialist equipment such as gearbox and generator, though 
not particularly frequent, are associated with a high level of 
down time.<p>

Where mechanical failures have occurred in great numbers, they 
were invariably the result of poor design detailing and/or 
manufacturing quality control.  These <b>type failures</b> are most 
serious for the operator.  One of the most (in)famous examples 
concerned the Alternegy GRP blades fitted to something like 1500 
wind turbines in California; after a relatively short period of 
operation, some of these blades experienced root failures which 
were subsequently found (1986) to be associated with inadequate 
quality control (incorrect tightening of root bolts, excessive 
stiffness in the root bushings, and lack of root filling).  Law 
suits were the inevitable outcome, and an extensive blade 
replacement programme.  This, and a few other failures like 
it, are now seen to be the result, to a large extent, of the 
'over-stimulation' of a juvenile wind energy industry by the tax 
credits offered for renewable energy plant in California in the 
early 1980s.<p>

Since that time, the technology has improved considerably, 
through a process of emulation of the best and rejection of the 
worst.  <b>Availability factors</b> of 95% or more, and <b>overall load 
factors</b> of up to 40%, are now being claimed for the most 
successful machines.  And many of the reasons for 
'under-performance' of wind turbines are now better understood: 
poor positioning in relation to the local landscape and to other 
turbines (micro-siting) is the cause in many cases.  Operation 
in the rain and blade soiling are also reasons for 
under-performance in various locations.<p>

<b>Vertical-axis wind turbines</b> have been mentioned only briefly so 
far.  In general, they have not lived up to the expectations 
their proponents have raised;  none of the supposed advantages 
over the HAWT configuration have been realised in practice, and 
they have suffered more than their share of vibration problems 
and type failures.  Worldwide, there are now very few 
manufacturers actively producing vertical-axis machines.  Indeed 
the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has recently 
criticised the UK's VAWT development as a waste of resources.<p>


<h2>Economics</h2><p>

Like any other renewable energy source, the fuel for a WTG is 
free, with no delivery charges to the site.  So why is economics 
an issue?  Well, the turbine must be bought, delivered to the 
site, installed and commissioned.  This requires capital, and 
there is a cost associated with that capital, even if only the 
'loss' of not getting any interest when you 
take the money out of your savings account to buy the wind turbine.  
Then there are costs incurred when the WTG is operated and 
maintained.  All these costs are encapsulated by the concept of 
the  <b>cost of energy</b>  (CoE), which is an expression for the total 
generation cost per unit of electricity produced:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  G  =  C ( R + M ) / E </h3>
</pre>
<p>
where <b>C</b> are the initial capital costs, <b>R</b> is the annual charge 
rate on capital, <b>M</b> is the annual operation and maintenance costs 
as a fraction of the initial capital, and <b>E</b> is the annual energy 
yield given by:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  E  =  h W F </h3>
</pre>
<p>
where <b>h</b> is the number of hours in a year (8760), <b>W</b> is the rated 
power of the wind turbine, and <b>F</b> is the overall load factor.  So 
the generation costs are:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  G  =  ( C / W ) ( R + M ) / ( h F ) </h3>
</pre>
<p>
This is the expression given for CoE in Ref 3, which is 
essentially that presented in the final chapter (Ref 4) of the 
most useful British text book.
The ratio <b>C / W</b>  describes the initial capital cost per 
kW of rated power, the sum <b>R + M</b>  describes the annual costs of 
capital and maintenance as a fraction of the initial capital, 
and the product <b>h F</b> is the effective number of hours in the year 
when the WTG can be considered to be operating at rated power.<p>

The annual charge rate can be expressed in terms of the interest

<p>
The overall load factor may be expressed as the product of the 
capacity factor <b>L</b> of the wind turbine, reduced by factors 
representing machine availability <b>A</b> and other causes of loss of 
energy or efficiency <b>a</b>, such as inter-machine interference or 
transmission losses, which are not accounted for in the machine 
performance characteristics:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  F  =  L A a </h3>
</pre>
<p>
The capacity factor <b>L</b> is determined from the machine performance 
characteristics and the wind speed frequency distribution.  
Reasonable assumptions can be made for the performance 
characteristic as a function of wind speed (or wind speed 
normalised by the rated wind speed <b>Ur</b>  ); the

shows a cubic curve over the range between the start-up wind speed and the 
rated speed, with zero power above the shut-down speed.  For the 
wind speed probability, a Rayleigh distribution is usually 
assumed in the absence of any site-specific data: this gives an 
expression for the probability of exceeding a given speed as a 
function of the site MAWS <b>Um</b> .  The 
 <a href="windperf.gif">same figure </a>
also shows such probability distributions for typical 
values of the ratio <b>Ur / Um</b> .  The capacity factor is then 
determined as the integrated sum (over all possible wind speeds) 
of the power production multiplied by the wind speed 
probability.  For a given wind turbine, this is a strong 
function of the site MAWS.<p>

The expression for the cost of energy can now be evaluated using 
some representative values: 2% for operation and maintenance 
costs, 95% for machine availability, and a factor of 90% for 
other losses.  Assuming a turbine with a rated wind speed of 
13.3m/s and a site with a MAWS of 7.8m/s (so that the ratio <b>Ur / Um</b>  
is equal to 1.71), the capacity factor turns out to be 37% which 
is representative of the first wind farm sites to be developed 
in the UK.  If we further assume that the capital is borrowed 
at a real rate of return of 8% per annum, and repayed over a 
term of 8 years, then the annual charge comes to 17.4%.  
Finally, for a capital cost of 
 £880 
 per kW of rated power, the 
cost of energy (over the period of the repayment) comes out as 
6.3p/kWh.  This number should not be taken as the definitive 
cost of wind-generated electricity, but merely an indicative 
value; the

(again reproduced from Ref 4) shows the sensitivity of this CoE to 
variations in the assumed values (logarithmic scales).  Wind 
speed is more significant than any other factor.  We have 
earlier discussed the issues affecting machine availability; 
capital cost is a function of machine size, production volume, 
and site accessibility.<p>

The current trend is to use an alternative formulation for cost 
of energy based on costs per unit of rotor swept area, rather 
than costs per unit of rated power.  Thus the CoE equation 
becomes:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  G  =  ( C / S ) R / (E / S)  +  M C / E </h3>
</pre>
<p>
where <b>S</b> is the rotor swept area, and the <b>specific yield</b> is given 
by the empirical relation<p>
<pre>
<h3>              E / S  =  2.5 Um ^ 3 </h3>
</pre>
<p>
In a recent analysis of UK developments (the BWEA submission to 
the Renewable Energy Advisory Group (Ref 5)), the following 
table of capital costs was given as a linear function of site 
MAWS<p>

and a value of 2.5% was recommended for the O&M costs.  
Assuming a capital recovery factor <b>R</b>  of .174 as before, and 
taking a hub-height wind speed of 7.8m/s, gives CoE of 
6.2p/kWh which is very close to the previous value.<p>

In making 
<b>cost comparisons</b> with other sources of electricity, it is 
important to use similar assumptions concerning the capital 
recovery in each case.  The generation of electricity by coal, 
gas and nuclear is a capital-intensive operation carried out 
by a large industrial company (National Power, PowerGen, and 
Nuclear Electric in the UK), and new generation plant is 
financed internally over a long time-scale.  The Renewable 
Energy Advisory Group (Ref 5) has recently estimated that "a 
typical onshore wind turbine would generate electricity at a 
cost of about 7p/kWh assuming a 20 year life, 7.5m/s wind 
speed at hub height and a 15% required rate of return".<p>

There have been two distinct trends in the <b>size of wind 
turbines</b>.  What may be described as "the Danish approach" 
involved stretching the simple and small-scale technology 
which had its roots in agricultural engineering; this led from 
machines of 22kW, upwards to 100kW and currently machines of 
around 300kW.  The other approach started with an initial 
decision to develop large (MW) machines using aerospace 
engineering, but the prototypes were prone to failure and 
uneconomic - these "manufacturers have gradually reduced the 
size to find a machine which is commercially viable.  The two 
approaches have now met at machines with rated capacities of 
approximately 300kW and rotor diameters of 25m." (Ref 6). A 
recent study on the potential of large machines (Ref 7) has 
concluded there will be little difference in the manufacturing 
cost (per annual kWh) of turbines with diameters in the range 30m to 80m; a 
related study (Ref 8) makes the same conclusion in relation to 
CoE over this diameter range, with the implication that "the 
best use of land" will be a decisive criterion for selecting the 
size of large wind turbines.<p>

An <b>energy accounting</b> approach to the cost of wind energy has 
been taken in Ref 9.  A 'harvest factor' was defined as the 
ratio of displaced primary energy by energy generated from the 
WTG to the primary energy consumed in its manufacture; the best 
machines were shown to have a harvest factor of 4, which means 
that within one year, 4 times the primary energy input was 
displaced by the wind electricity generation.<p>

It is beyond the scope of this lecture to present comparative 
costs of the different supply technologies, since that would 
require the adoption of common standards in each case.  But the 
opportunity must be taken to raise the issue of <b>external costs</b>, 
the costs which may be added to the financial costs to account 
for the external consequences of electricity production, 
including damage to the environment and health, the cost of 
clearing up polluted areas, defending oil routes, etc.  Many 
countries are now introducing 'carbon taxes' which are a 
practical attempt to add something for external costs to the 
fossil-fuel sources.  An estimate of the avoided cost of using 
wind energy is given in Ref 10 for both the Netherlands and UK.  
In the UK, that study finds a figure of 4.6p/kWh is saved by 
using wind energy, of which 1.9p/kWh is for the cost of 
emissions; these estimates may be conservative since they 
exclude the external costs associated with particulate and solid 
pollutants.  Clearly estimates of this magnitude would make a 
significant difference to our interpretation of comparative 
costs, but the methodology needs to gain a broad acceptance 
before it can provide a rational basis to decision making.  A 
recent critical survey (Ref 11) of published electricity 
generation costs and trends has concluded that a realistic 
carbon tax, scheduled for the year 2000, would add 1.2p to the 
cost of generating a kWh from coal, 0.8p for gas, and 0.5p for 
nuclear.<p>


<h2>Current Developments in the UK</h2> <p>
<h4>this section is most in need of updating:  scheduled for January 1995</h4>

The situation of wind power (and, indeed, the other renewables) 
has changed dramatically in the UK since the turn of the decade.  
Prior to then, there were just a few, isolated and experimental, 
wind turbines scattered across England, Wales and Scotland.  The 
UK's Department of Energy (now disbanded) began a modestly-
funded R&D programme in the mid 1970's, concentrating most of 
its support for the large prototypes eventually built on the 
Island of Orkney, Scotland (the 60m diameter HAWT rated 3MW) and 
at Carmarthen Bay, Wales (the 25m diameter VAWT rated 130kW).  
From the late 1970s onwards, the electricity utility for England 
and Wales, the Central Electricity Generating Board (now 
disbanded) showed a steadily-increasing interest in wind energy, 
to the extent of developing the site at Carmarthen Bay as a 
demonstration centre for wind energy, and building a 55m 
diameter HAWT (rated 1MW) at Richborough in Kent.  Then, at the 
end of the 1980s, the CEGB announced a major plan to develop 
wind farms, of about 25 machines each, at three named sites.<p>

But that plan was blown sideways by the Government's decision to 
privatise the UK electricity supply industry.  The CEGB was 
split into four companies:  National Power, PowerGen, Nuclear 
Electric and the National Grid Company.  The 12 regional area 
boards, which distributed and sold on the electricity to the 
consumer, became independent companies, called Regional 
Electricity Companies, jointly owning the National Grid Company.  
Also at this time (late 1989 - early 1990), the real costs of 
nuclear power were emerging from the public inquiry into the 
proposed Sizewell B reactor (now started up), giving 
rise to the need for the Government to retain ownership of the 
nuclear power stations through Nuclear Electric.  
Simultaneously, a change to the rating system (local property 
tax) eliminated the unfair distinction between generation plant 
operated by the CEGB and plant operated by the independents.  
From this major upheaval, via the mechanism of the Non-Fossil 
Fuel Obligation, has emerged the Government stimulus which has 
had such a dramatic impact on renewables in the UK.<p>

The NFFO is a requirement placed upon the 12 RECs "to contract 
for a specified amount of generating capacity from non-fossil 
sources (ie nuclear and the renewables, including wind). ... The 
additional cost to the RECs resulting from satisfying NFFO 
orders is recovered by them via a levy on electricity sales. ... 
The first renewables order was made [in 1990] and the contracts 
made by the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency to comply with it 
include nine for wind, of which five are wind farms" (Ref 12). 
A second order was placed in 1991, including a total of 49 wind 
projects, of which 38 are wind farms. These wind projects are 
listed in the attached <a href="farmlist.html">table</a>, 
and their locations indicated on 
the attached <a href="map.gif">map</a>.<p>
