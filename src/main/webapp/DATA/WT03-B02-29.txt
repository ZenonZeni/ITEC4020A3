Infection Control
TB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?


Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfully
combined?

The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris with
researchers expressing differing views.

D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less than
compatible, because they target different groups.

"Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIV
prevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted.

"Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,
attempts to combine them are difficult."

Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conference
on Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.

Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is the
same - to prevent infections - the focus must be different.

"In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of case
management in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventing
transmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstract
presented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.
Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit the
infection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infected
person who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection.

"Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on general
health education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point of
implementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point of
implementation must be the general population of subsets of it."

R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Program
countered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs is
essential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficiently
implement.

"Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,
but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Brien
noted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient care
and help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling is
not widely available."

O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patients
with TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TB
programs and prevent further TB transmission in households.

O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis
to be lacking.

"AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which together
can address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLD
meeting.

"Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for working
separately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is now
recognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death in
HIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer be
permitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care and
preventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."

The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programs
for people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis in
developing areas.

"Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home care
programs for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomed
rapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLD
conference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100
different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affected
families, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals can
scarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families have
seriously deteriorated, due to AIDS.

"More than half of the people with HIV related illness will develop
tuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to complete
treatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various health
care programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses and
reduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist within
home care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in close
contact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB disease
among HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could provide
drugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TB
prevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have
already implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."

Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.  O'Brien and
E.  van Praag are from the Global Tuberculosis Program and the Global Program
on AIDS, World Health Organization, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.

Animal Models
Mouse Model Useful for Determining TB Pathology


A murine study suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is far more virulent
when given by the respiratory route than by the intravenous route.

Researcher Robert J.  North of New York's Trudeau Institute earlier reported
that intravenous inoculation of mice with M.  tuberculosis results in a slowly
progressive infection in the lungs, despite the acquisition of systemic host
immunity capable of resolving infection in the liver, spleen and kidneys.

"The present study was undertaken to determine whether the peculiar
susceptibility of the lungs to M.  tuberculosis infection is even more obvious
in mice infected via the respiratory route," North wrote ("M.  tuberculosis is
Strikingly More Virulent for Mice When Given via the Respiratory than via the
Intravenous Route," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1550-1553).

North found that fewer M.  tuberculosis colony-forming units (cfu) given by
aerosol were substantially more virulent for mice than much larger numbers
inoculated intravenously, as shown by a faster rate of bacillary growth in the
lungs and much shorter survival of the host.

"Earlier death of mice infected by aerosol was associated with faster
development of lung pathology, even though the number of M.  tuberculosis
given intravenously resulted in the same number of bacilli initially
implanting in the lungs as the number given by aerosol," North wrote.  "Mice
depleted of CD4 T cells died of infection much sooner than immunocompetent
mice but at about the same time after being infected via either route."

North noted that mice infected by aerosol, in contrast with those given M.
tuberculosis intravenously were incapable of resolving infection in their
livers, indicating that they generated and expressed a lower level of systemic
immunity.

"This interpretation is in keeping with the finding that mice depleted of CD4
T cells died at about the same time after infection was initiated via either
route and much earlier than immunocompetent controls," North wrote.  "In
addition, the survival time of mice infected via the respiratory route was
greatly extended if they were also infected intravenously with a larger number
of M.  tuberculosis.  Thus, a larger number of M.  tuberculosis cfu given
intravenously induces a higher level of systemic immunity than does a smaller
number given by aerosol.  This likely occurs because a larger intravenous
inoculum represents a larger quantity of replicating antigen capable of
engaging larger amounts of lymphoid tissue, including that in the spleen."

North concludes that bacilli that reach the lungs via the respiratory route
have a growth advantage over those that enter from blood during the initial
stage of infection.

"This may be because microorganisms that enter the lung via the respiratory
route are ingested by resident alveolar macrophages, whereas those that enter
from the blood need to be carried into the organ after being ingested by
monocytes, neutrophils, or pulmonary intravascular macrophages.

"Given that resident alveolar macrophages tend to be less capable than other
macrophages of killing microbial pathogens in general, it is possible that
this enables M.  tuberculosis to grow more rapidly during the initial stage of
infection.  Results of the present study support this concept in that M.
tuberculosis that entered the lung directly grew faster during the first 20
days of infection than did M.  tuberculosis that entered from blood."

The corresponding author for this study is Robert J.  North, Trudeau
Institute, Inc., P.O.  Box 59, Saranac Lake, New York 12983.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Disease Markers
Increased Soluble CD14 Useful Marker in TB Patients


Increased levels of soluble CD14 are present in bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

CD14 was first identified as a marker of cells derived from the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, although it was later found on other cells like
neutrophils and B lymphocytes.  The cell surface glycoprotein serves as a
cellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide with
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased in
serum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonary
sarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum and
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheisel
and colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 are
also found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels in
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December
1995;108:1614-1616).

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologic
characteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

"The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was
increased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22
ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote.

"No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar to
patients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found in
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,
this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing to
granuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cell
surface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determine
the significance and clinical relevance of this finding."

Drug Screening
Particle Counting Assay Evaluates TB Drugs


A particle counting immunoassay developed in Belgium appears to offer a rapid
and inexpensive method for screening antituberculosis agents.

Researcher J.P.  Van Vooren and colleagues from the University of Brussels
developed the method based on particle counting immunoassay to detect
mycobacteria in clinical specimens.

"We adapted this procedure to test the efficiency of antimicrobial agents
against M.  tuberculosis," Van Vooren et al.  wrote in an abstract presented
to the 1995 annual meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and
Lung Disease (IUATLD), held in Paris, France.

The latex particles used in the technique were coated with polyclonal anti-BCG
to detect mycobacterial antigens.

Four drug-susceptible, five multi-resistant and three isoniazid-resistant M.
tuberculosis strains were inoculated in bottles containing nonradioactive
Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium and rifampin or isoniazid.

To lessen risk of contamination the mycobacteria were destroyed in an
autoclave between culture and subsequent manipulations.  Drug susceptibilities
were measured and those obtained with the BACTEC system were critically
compared.  For each of the 12 strains drug sensitivities were found comparable
in the two methods and could be determined after five days.

"We conclude that particle immunoassay gives access to a safe, reproducible,
fast and inexpensive nonradioactive procedure to screen drug sensitivities for
mycobacterial strains," Van Vooren et al.  wrote in an abstract presented to
the IUATLD meeting.

Epidemiology (TB)
Old Infection May Be Responsible for Clustered TB in Arkansas


Fingerprint clustering in large rural geographic areas may not represent
recent tuberculosis transmission, according to a report from the U.S.  Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Arkansas Department of
Health.

Researcher C.R.  Braden and colleagues reported the findings at the 1995
annual meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (IUATLD).

Previous studies have suggested that M.  tuberculosis isolates with similar
DNA fingerprints represent recent transmission of tuberculosis (TB) between
patients.

In this study DNA fingerprinting and conventional epidemiology techniques were
used to identify connections, recent and remote, among clustered patients.

M.  tuberculosis isolates obtained from Arkansas residents diagnosed in 1992
and 1993 were analyzed by DNA fingerprinting.  For clustered patients, health
department and laboratory records were established by identifying direct
exposure among cluster members or by placing cluster members in the same
location when TB transmission could have occurred.

A total of 338 culture positive cases of TB were identified.  Fingerprints
were obtained on isolates from 248 (73 percent).  Of these, 137 (55 percent)
grouped into 35 clusters.  Fingerprints had from two to 17 bands.  Cluster
sizes ranged from two to 15 patients and 15 clusters had only two patients.

Connections were found for all patients in seven (20 percent) clusters, some
in eight (23 percent) clusters and none in 20 (57 percent) clusters.

Twelve clusters, including the two largest, had fingerprints with five or less
bands.  Some or all patients were linked in 57 percent of clusters whose
isolates had fingerprints with more than five bands, but only 13 percent of
those with fingerprints with five or less bands.

"For most clusters, conventional epidemiologic methods did not identify
opportunities for TB transmission among cluster patients," Braden et al.
wrote.  "Fingerprint clustering in a large rural geographic area may not
represent recent transmission and DNA fingerprint patterns with five or less
bands may lack specificity."

Occupational Exposure (TB)
Most TB in New York HCWs Due to Recent Infections


A finding that most tuberculosis cases among health care workers in a New York
study were due to recent infections suggests that occupational transmission of
tuberculosis routinely occurs in facilities without recognized tuberculosis
(TB) outbreaks, according to Cornell University's Public Health Research
Institute.

A number of nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred across the United
States during 1990 and 1991, resulting in several deaths among personnel in
contact with infected patients.  These outbreaks prompted the issuance of new
guidelines for health care workers from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).

"Since (the implementation of the CDC guidelines) there have been relatively
few reported outbreaks, which suggests that current control measures may be
effective," researcher Kent A Sepkowitz and colleagues wrote ("TB Among Urban
Health Care Workers:  A Study Using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
Typing," Clinical Infectious Diseases, November 1995;21:1098-1102).

"However, it is not known whether the apparently sporadic cases of
tuberculosis in health care workers are due to occupationally acquired
infections or, as a recent study suggested, are more likely due to
community-acquired infections.  In addition, the risk for HIV infected
personnel is not well defined, although some have suggested that HIV infected
health care workers should have the option of being assigned to an area
associated with a low risk of exposure to tuberculosis."

In this study Sepkowitz and colleagues at New York's Cornell University
Medical College analyzed cases of tuberculosis using laboratory-based active
surveillance system for TB at six hospitals in New York City (members of the
TBNetwork).

Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992 to 1994 were analyzed according
to the occupational status of the patients.

The researchers reviewed medical records and restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was
performed.

"No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in
the study period," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Occupational status was known
for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing.
Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as
determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease."

RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65 percent) of 20 health care
workers and 50 (41 percent) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered
RFLP pattern.

Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status
revealed that HIV status and health care worker status were independent risk
factors for a clustered RFLP strain.

The recent transmission rate of 65 percent outlined by Sepkowitz et al.  is
greater than that seen among health care workers with tuberculosis in Bern,
Switzerland, San Francisco, California, or the Bronx, New York.

Sepkowitz et al.  conclude that many apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis
among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational
transmission.

The authors note, however, that the cases analyzed in their report probably
reflect transmissions that occurred prior to the time hospitals updated
infection control procedures.

"Our data suggest that occupational transmission of tuberculosis occurs in
hospitals without recognized outbreaks," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Health
care workers with HIV infection appear to be at particular risk.  Prospective
RFLP-based studies will be useful to confirm these findings and may help
determine the efficacy of current guidelines for preventing transmission of
tuberculosis in health care settings."

Occupational Exposure (TB)
Product Simplifies Compliance with Guidelines for TB Exposure


Uvex Safety, Inc., Smithfield, Rhode Island, has introduced a new family of
N95 disposable particulate respirators designed to help healthcare and
emergency medical organizations comply with recently-enacted regulations for
respiratory protection for workers exposed to tuberculosis (TB).

The uvex/Pro-Tech N95 respirators enable users of existing uvex HEPA-Tech
respirators to update their equipment at about half the cost without
fit-testing for employees.  Because they have the same physical design, the
uvex N95 respirators allow users to switch without a re-fit test if they have
been trained and fit tested with the HEPA-Tech models.

Featuring a 95 percent efficient filter media, the N95 respirators meet the
new NIOSH test criteria for particulate respiratory filters (42 CFR Part 84).
In addition, they comply with the new U.S.  Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) guidelines for respiratory protection against occupational
exposure to TB.  Available in three sizes and capable of
qualitative/quantitative fit testing as well as reliable fit checking, they
also meet all performance criteria in the new OSHA enforcement policies for TB
protection.

There are currently two models in the uvex/Pro-Tech N95 product family, both
of which feature adjustable top and bottom head straps as well as a patented
foam sealing flange.

* The Model 4010 is an entry level respirator designed for medical
environments that do not permit open exhalation of respiratory aerosols.

* The Model 4Al0 includes an exhalation valve that streamlines exhaled air out
of the facepiece, making it cooler and more comfortable to wear.

"Now that OSHA has adopted the CDC guidelines into regulation, the healthcare
field has a new alternative for TB protection," explains uvex industrial
hygienist Michael Fuchs.  "In many cases, the new regulations enable employers
to make an across-the-board change from existing HEPA respirators to the new
N95 models.  But in large facilities and organizations, this can prove to be a
time-consuming problem for safety officials.

"With its new N95 respirators, uvex is making the transition easier and less
costly for its customers.  Users who have been fit-tested for uvex HEPA-Tech
respirators can simply switch to similar sized uvex N95 models with no
qualitative or quantitative fit testing ...  at about half the cost of the
Hepa-Tech 3010 Series.  The switch will be quick and simple."

Pediatrics 
Hepatic Toxicity Reversible in TB-Treated Children


Hepatic toxicity in children treated for tuberculosis in Macedonia was less
severe and long lasting when preventive measures were undertaken.

Researcher L.  Jakovski and colleagues from Macedonia's Institute for
Respiratory Diseases in Children compared hepatic toxicity during two periods
(1974 to 1982 and 1986 to 1994).

Their study was presented at the 1995 annual meeting of the International
Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) , held in Paris, France.

Investigations were performed before the beginning of treatment and each 15
days after treatment was begun (during hospitalization).

Of the 1521 patients treated for tuberculosis between 1974 and 1982, 118 had
disturbed hepatic function (7.76 percent).  In the group of 917 children
treated between 1986 and 1994, 29 had disturbed hepatic function (3.16
percent).

Jakovski et al.  found that there were 2.5 times fewer hepatic disturbances in
the second group of patients.  The majority of toxicities occurred in the 0-2
year old age group during both periods.

Combination therapy with isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide was the
treatment regimen which caused the most adverse reactions.

During the second treatment period patients were given hepatoprotective drugs
and toxic reactions were monitored carefully.

In all cases during both treatment periods there was recovery of hepatic
function.

Respiratory Diseases in Children, Skopje, Macedonia.

Prophylaxis (TB)
Isoniazid-Based Therapy Useful Despite Hepatotoxicity


Prophylactic isoniazid therapy is beneficial to all patients with pulmonary
fibrotic lesions compatible with previous tuberculosis (TB), despite the risk
of potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatitis, according to
a report from Switzerland.

The report warns, however, that it is still unclear whether the benefits of
such therapy outweigh possible side-effects.

Tuberculosis reactivation is increased among patients with chest X-rays
showing untreated fibrotic lesions suggestive of healed, previous TB
(so-called fibrotic lesions).

"Prophylactic treatment with a six to 12-month course of isoniazid (INH) has
proven effective in these cases, giving about 70 percent protection rate
against reactivation of TB," researcher F.P.  Sarasin and colleagues wrote
("Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Sequelae:  Which
Patients Up to Which Age?"  Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:394-400).

"Nonetheless, whether the benefit of isoniazid outweighs it potentially
life-threatening side effects (isoniazid-induced hepatitis) in all age groups,
and in patients with coexisting diseases that limit life expectancy such as
severe chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), a frequent clinical situation, remains unstudied."

Earlier studies have focused on recommendations for prophylactic isoniazid
among patients with positive tuberculin skin test reactions only.  None,
however, has specifically addressed recommendations regarding persons with
fibrotic lesions discovered on chest X-ray.

In this study Sarasin et al.  conducted a Markov-based decision analysis model
which balances the risk of recurrent TB against TB-related mortality,
incidence of isoniazid-related hepatitis, and isoniazid-related death.

They also sought to determine the optimal strategy between a six- to 12-month
course of prophylactic isoniazid and therapeutic abstention in different age
groups and in patients with severe coexisting diseases that limit life
expectancy such as CHF or COPD.

"The core of our decision tree was a model representing the natural history of
untreated patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae," Sarasin et al.
wrote.  "Over time, they may die from different age- or gender-related causes,
or develop early or late TB and die from it.  Whether these patients may
benefit from prophylactic isoniazid involves weighing the trade-offs between
the short term risks of isoniazid-related complications and avoidance of TB
reactivation, a benefit that may be accrued over the short or the long term,
depending on when TB occurs."

The Markov decision analysis found that in all groups of patients,
prophylactic isoniazid clearly reduced the number of deaths from tuberculosis,
whereas very few cases died from isoniazid-related toxicity.  However, because
isoniazid-related deaths occur early, and TB-related deaths can occur early or
late, the gain in life expectancy was small.

"Particularly for patients with short survival such as those older than 80
years and those with CHF or COPD, the average gain in life expectancy provided
by prophylactic isoniazid did not exceed on week," Sarasin et al.  wrote.

"When the gains in life expectancy provided by prophylactic isoniazid are
small and may not be considered clinically relevant, the optimal therapeutic
decision becomes a toss-up.  In clinical practice, toss-ups will undoubted be
interpreted differently by the physicians, the patients, and the health care
planners.  While physicians will focus on the patient's attitude toward risk
(risk-aversion versus risk-seeking profile) and on therapeutic observance,
patients will pay much more attention to the quality of life associated with
isoniazid therapy, and specifically the inconvenience of taking medication,
office visits, and laboratory tests.  On the other hand, from the health
planners' vantage point, the potential epidemiologic benefit of preventing
several future TB cases by treating one patient preventively will be the most
important determinant of decision making."

The authors conclude that the usually recommended six- to 12-month course of
prophylactic isoniazid is beneficial to all cohort age groups.  They added,
however, that recommendations should be modulated for the very elderly and
those with severe disease that limits life expectancy.

"For this subgroup of patients, frequently encountered in daily clinical
practice, the decision whether and for how long to give prophylactic therapy
might reasonably be left to the judgement of the individual patient and the
physician," they wrote.

Therapy
Levofloxacin More Active than Ofloxacin in In Vitro Study


The experimental antituberculosis quinolone levofloxacin showed two- to
four-times more antimicrobial activity than ofloxacin in a newly reported in
vitro study from Japan.

"Levofloxacin showed greater activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
phagocytosed in macrophages than ofloxacin," researcher H.  Saito and
colleagues wrote ("In Vitro Antimycobacterial Activity of a New Quinolone,
Levofloxacin," Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:377-380).

Levofloxacin, the optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin, exhibits significant
bactericidal activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase and has a strong antimicrobial
activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

The antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin has been found to be eight to 128
times greater than that of the corresponding D-isomer and approximately twice
as potent as that of ofloxacin.

In earlier studies Saito et al.  reported that some new quinolones including
ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin and sparfloxacin possessed appreciable in
vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activity, especially against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  fortuitum, and M.  leprae.

In this study Saito et al.  examined in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various pathogenic mycobacteria, in particular M.
tuberculosis and M.  avium complex (MAC).

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin for various
mycobacterial species were determined by the agar dilution method using 7H11
medium and compared with those of ofloxacin.  Antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis and M.  intracellulare phagocytosed in
murine peritoneal macrophages was measured in terms of reducing
cell-associated bacterial colony forming units (CFUs).

MICs of levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  marinum, M.
scrofulaceum, M.  avium, M.  intracellulare, M.  fortuitum, and M.  chelonae
were two to four times lower than those of ofloxacin.  Levofloxacin exhibited
higher efficacy in reducing bacterial CFUs in macrophages than ofloxacin.

"The present results showed that in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various mycobacteria was two to four times greater than
that of ofloxacin, in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration values," Saito
et al.  wrote.

Previous investigators have reported that the antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various bacteria other than mycobacteria is generally
twice that of ofloxacin (Hayakawa et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemother
1986;29:163-164; Imamura et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemo 1987;31:325-327
and Tanka et al., J Antimicrob Chemother 1990;26:659-666).

"The difference in in vitro activity of levofloxacin from ofloxacin in these
reports is therefore consistent with that in the present study," Saito et al.
wrote.  "In the case of M.  intracellulare, significant delay of bacterial
growth was caused by levofloxacin added at 1 mg/L, but such efficacy was not
observed for ofloxacin at the same concentration.  Levofloxacin and ofloxacin
at doses of 10 mg/L prevented the bacterial growth during the whole incubation
period.  There were significant differences between these two quinolones in
the efficacy in reducing the intra-macrophage growth of M.  intracellulare."

Transmission (TB)
Primary School Teacher in Amsterdam Infects 19 Students


A primary school teacher with tuberculous laryngitis in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, infected all of his students with tuberculosis (TB) before his
disease was detected.

All 19 children who had been taught by the teacher became infected with TB and
four contracted active disease, according to a report presented at the 1995
Annual Meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (IUATLD), held in Paris, France.

"Three months after the start of the new school year, the notification of
primary tuberculosis in two children of the same primary school urged the
local Municipal Health Service to perform source detection and contact
tracing," researcher S.T.  Keizer and colleagues from The Netherlands' Health
Service wrote in an abstract presented at the IUATLD conference.

Extensive testing was conducted and those with a skin induration of 10 mm or
more were considered infected.  A case of primary tuberculosis was defined as
the combination of a positive Mantoux test and compatible radiographic
findings.

"A teacher was identified as the source case," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "At the
time of detection he was without symptoms, yet his chest X-ray showed typical
infiltration of the left upper lobe and his sputum was Ziehl-Neelsen positive.
His medical history revealed that he had been suffering from severe hoarseness
for three months until a benign growth was removed from his vocal cords during
the summer-holidays.  The pathologist had reported the presence of epithelioid
cell granuloma indicating tuberculosis, but this had not reached the attention
of the otorhinolaryngist."

Nearly one-third of all 99 children at the school were found to be infected
with tuberculosis.

"All 19 children who had been taught by our patient until the summer holidays
were infected," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "Among them were four cases of primary
tuberculosis.  In the group (13 children) that had entered his class after the
summer-holidays only one infection was detected.  It is concluded that this
teacher was extremely infectious during the time he was hoarse from a
tuberculous laryngeal lesion.  The consideration of TB in the differential
diagnosis of laryngeal lesions needs emphasis for individual and for public
health reasons."

Pumerantz, P.A.  Selwyn and V.P.  Neklesa, et al.  New Haven, Connecticut.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To assess the accuracy of
chest radiographic interpretation in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
HIV-positive patients and to identify the frequency with which these
infections mimic each other radiographically.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The
admitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratory
proved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIV
positive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively and
independently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinical
presentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and final
diagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followed
by an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis was
made in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the median
accuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and no
active disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderate
interobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked other
infections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis by
all 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretation
allows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIV
positive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.  In
approximately 10% of cases, these infections may mimic each other
radiographically."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis of abdominal
lymph nodes is in some countries and can be easily misdiagnosed as malignant
lymphoma.  This study evaluates specific imaging criteria for differentiating
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes on contrast
enhanced CT.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The enhanced CT features of 125 sites in
50 patients, including tuberculosis (20 patients) and malignant lymphoma (30
patients) in abdominal lymph nodes, were retrospectively evaluated in a blind
review for the enhancement criteria of morphology, density, and location.
RESULTS:  Approximately 94% of sites of tuberculosis showed a ringlike
enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes, as compared with 4% of the sites of
malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Approximately 55% of the patients with
tuberculosis had a mass of multilocular appearance compared with 4% of the
patients with malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Tuberculosis frequently involved
the mesenteric, omental, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, while malignant
lymphoma frequently involved the retroperitoneal space.  But, the
retroperitoneal lymph nodes under L-2 were involved with tuberculosis in only
8% of the patients, whereas malignant lymphoma involved about 20% (P<.01).
Combining all criteria, reviewers diagnosed tuberculosis correctly in 94%,
with 93% specificity and 95% sensitivity.  CONCLUSION:  The differentiation of
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma can be made with contrast-enhanced CT on
the basis of characteristic enhancement and sites of involved
lymphadenopathy."

The purpose of this exhibit is to illustrate the findings of the genitourinary
tract involved with tuberculosis by using conventional and modern imaging
studies.  This exhibit includes the imaging findings of the early
dissemination, progressive destruction and healing, and late sequelae of
tuberculosis involving various organs of the genitourinary tract including the
kidney, ureter, bladder, testis and epididymis, prostate and seminal tracts,
uterus, ovary, and the related peritoneal cavity.  This exhibit also
demonstrates the long-term results of balloon dilation and stent placement for
the tuberculous strictures of the urinary tract."

and drug abuse, tuberculosis has been resurging.  Tuberculosis is especially
important because it is readily treatable, and permanent damage is potentially
preventable.  MR imaging has been successfully used for the evaluation of
musculoskeletal tuberculosis.  This exhibit presents various MR imaging
manifestations of musculoskeletal tuberculosis that involves the spine,
tubular bones, flat bones, synovial joints, fibrous joints, bursae, tendon
sheaths, and muscles.  The role of MR imaging and contrast enhancement in the
evaluation of musculoskeletal tuberculosis and the differential diagnosis are
discussed."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis (TB) in AIDS
patients has a more aggressive and different pathologic picture than it does
in non-AIDS patients; this fact influences the methods of diagnosis and
treatment.  Gallium studies have been recommended in the work-up of these
patients.  The purpose of this study was to review the gallium scans in all
AIDS patients with a proved diagnosis of TB to find the sites of involvement
and causes of false negative gallium scanning and to provide correlation with
chest x-ray findings.  CONCLUSION:  Lymph node involvement with TB infection
in AIDS patients is more common than parenchymal lung involvement.  The
mediastinal and supraclavicular areas were involved most often, followed by
the axillary, upper abdominal and inguinal regions.  Anti-TB treatment affects
the sensitivity of gallium scanning in AIDS patients with TB."

Immunology (TB) 
"Regulation of the Human Cellular Immune Response in Tuberculosis."  J.J.
Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemic
immune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayed
type hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, and
in vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.
Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chiefly
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,
depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression of
cytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) function
in autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,
respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) from
virulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)
relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,
TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increased
spontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated
production of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)
reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gamma
expression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppression
and energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restores
PPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,
and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too may
reflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding of
immunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions for
immunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and
monocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serum
and cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosis
patients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,
monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;
and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infected
macrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutually
enhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for a
subunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role for
extracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.
Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominance
of certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine or
DTH skin test."

Infection Control (TB)
"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients complete
treatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factors
concern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatment
outcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, and
health care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patients
and for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIV
infected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality of
treatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the core
Behavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observed
therapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; where
successful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social and
Behavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographic
research has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals about
tuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associate
tuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about the
appropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed about
the cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show the
effectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, and
comprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinic
practices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research is
emerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk to
patients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studies
of treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, with
implications for the education and supervision of physicians who treat
tuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development of
locally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral research
must focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existing
descriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory and
research methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues will
be identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types of
patients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,
and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infection
seek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."

Implications for Its Diverse Biological Activities."  Journal of Biological

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Biological Chemistry, "The chaperonin activity of sequence related chaperonin
10 proteins requires their aggregation into heptameric structures.  We
describe size-exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation studies that
reveal that while Escherichia coli chaperonin 10 exists as a heptamer, the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis chaperonin 10 is tetrameric in dilute solutions and
in whole M.  tuberculosis lysate.  At high protein concentration and in the
presence of saturating amounts of divalent ions, the protein is heptameric.
Human chaperonin 10 is predominantly heptameric, although smaller oligomers
were detected.  These differences in structural assembly between species may
explain differences in biological activity such as antigenicity.  Using
C-terminal and N-terminal fragments, sequence 1-25 was identified as
indispensable for aggregation.  CD spectroscopy studies revealed that (i) a
minimum at 202-204 nm correlates with aggregation and characterizes not only
the spectrum of the mycobacterial protein, but also those of E.  coli and
human chaperonin 10 proteins; (ii) the interactions between subunits are of
the hydrophobic type; and (iii) the anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet is the
main secondary structure element of subunits in both tetrameric and heptameric

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Biological Chemistry, "The major mycolic acid produced by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis contains two cis-cyclopropanes in the meromycolate chain.  The
gene whose product cyclopropanates the proximal double bond was cloned by
homology to a putative cyclopropane synthase identified from the Mycobacterium
leprae genome sequencing project.  This gene, named cma2, was sequenced and
found to be 52% identical to cma1 (which cyclopropanates the distal double
bond) and 73% identical to the gene from M.  leprae.  Both cma genes were
found to be restricted in distribution to pathogenic species of mycobacteria.
Expression of cma2 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in the cyclopropanation
of the proximal double bond in the alpha(1), series of mycolic acids.
Coexpression of both cyclopropane synthases resulted in cyclopropanation of
both centers, producing a molecule structurally similar to the M.
tuberculosis alpha-dicyclopropyl mycolates.  Differential scanning calorimetry
of purified cell walls and mycolic acids demonstrated that cyclopropanation of
the proximal position raised the observed transition temperature by
3(degree)C.  These results suggest that cyclopropanation contributes to the
structural integrity of the cell wall complex."  The corresponding author for

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "Microbiologic confirmation of
pulmonary tuberculosis among patients whose sputum smear is negative is
increasingly important because of greater incidence among immunocompromised
hosts and emergence of drug-resistant strains.  We prospectively compared
sputum induction to fiber-optic bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of such
patients.  Consecutive patients referred for investigation of possible active
pulmonary tuberculosis underwent sputum induction with hypertonic saline
delivered by an ultrasonic nebulizer between 2 and 48 h before transnasal
fiber-optic bronchoscopy.  All specimens were examined for acid-fast bacilli
with fluorescent microscopy and cultured for mycobacteria.  Clinical
information was abstracted from patient records, and X-rays were reviewed by
two blinded readers.  Among 101 participants, sputum induction was
well-tolerated without complications and provided adequate samples in 93.
Sensitivity of direct acid-fast bacilli smear of specimens from both
techniques was low.  Sensitivity and negative predictive value of culture from
bronchoscopy specimens was 73% and 91% compared with 87% and 96%,
respectively, for sputum induction when a specimen was obtained.  Direct costs
for bronchoscopy totaled Canadian $187.60 compared with Canadian $22.22 for
sputum induction.  Sputum induction was well-tolerated, low-cost, and provided
the same, if not better, diagnostic yield compared with bronchoscopy in the
diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis."  The corresponding author

investigate possible laboratory contamination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
cultures which resulted in the misdiagnosis of tuberculosis.  We have
investigated three cases in which a patient's culture was positive for M.
tuberculosis but there was not a high clinical suspicion for disease.  In each
instance, another patient with clinically obvious pulmonary tuberculosis had
specimens cultured concurrently within the same clinical laboratory.  The
isolates from both the obvious cases of tuberculosis and the suspect cases
were obtained through the State of Alabama TB Laboratory, but these isolates
originated at a commercial laboratory, a community hospital laboratory, and at
a university hospital.  MTB isolates were fingerprinted by probing for the
insertion sequence IS6110.  With each of the three pairs of isolates (case and
suspicious case), identical IS6110 banding patterns were found suggesting
identical MTB strains.  Because the patients were geographically separated, it
is strongly suspected that laboratory contamination of M.  tuberculosis
cultures resulted in the three suspect cases being diagnosed with
tuberculosis.  These findings indicate that positive M.  tuberculosis cultures
resulting from laboratory contamination can occur."  The corresponding author

and inhA genes of Isoniazid-Resistant Clinical Isolates of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis."  Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, November

1995;39(11):2472-2477.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy, "Resistance to isoniazid in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis has been associated with mutations in genes encoding the
mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase (katG) and the InhA protein (inhA).  Among
the 26 isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates evaluated in this study,
mutations in putative inhA regulatory sequences were identified in 2
catalase-positive isolates, katG gene alterations were detected in 20 strains,
and 4 isolates had wild-type katG and inhA genes.  Mutations in the katG gene
were detected in all 11 catalase negative isolates:  one frameshift insertion,
two partial gene deletions, and nine different missense mutations were
identified.  An arginine-to-leucine substitution at position 463 was detected
in nine catalase-positive isolates.  However, site-directed mutagenesis
experiments demonstrated that the presence of a leucine at codon 463 did not
alter the activity of the M.  tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase and did not
affect the capacity of this enzyme to restore isoniazid susceptibility to
isoniazid-resistant, katG-defective Mycobacterium smegmatis pi-ii cells.
These studies further support the association between katG and inhA gene
mutations and isoniazid resistance in M.  tuberculosis, while also suggesting
that other undefined mechanisms of isoniazid resistance exist."  The

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "A case-control study was conducted
in Saudi Arabia, where the same strain of BCG has been used and surveys had
shown that up to 88% of vaccinated children remain tuberculin negative.
Active cases were obtained by surveying the seven tuberculosis centers in 1
yr.  Control subjects were obtained from a nationwide survey of normal
individuals.  Vaccination in both groups was ascertained by history and BCG
scar.  Relative risk of contracting active tuberculosis in the vaccinated
versus unvaccinated and protection was calculated.  protection was as follows:
age group 5 to 14 yr, 82% (55 to 93%); age group 15 to 24 yr, 67% (55 to 77%);
and age group 25 to 34 yr, 20% (-6 to 37%).  We document the uninterrupted
record of protection by BCG administered in the neonatal period and discuss
the significance of vaccination timing.  We concur with other studies that
protection lapsed after about 20 yr.  More importantly, this is the first
large study that documents a lack of tuberculin sensitivity despite
protection.  This challenges the view that sensitization is essential for
protection and supports the 'two-pathway' theory that BCG vaccination could
trigger either protective (Lister type) or antagonistic (tuberculin or Koch
type) reactions and that the most protective vaccines would have little
tuberculin-sensitizing effect because the two pathways are competitive."  The

Pharmacoeconomics, November 1995;8(5):385-399.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in
Pharmacoeconomics, "The treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is ranked as the most
cost effective of all therapeutic programmes in terms of cost per year of life
saved.  Nevertheless, TB kills or debilitates more adults aged between 15 and
59 years than any other disease in the world; furthermore, about 2 to 4% of
the burden of disease, 7% of all deaths and 26% of all preventable deaths are
directly attributable to TB.  About one-third of the world's population is
infected with the TB bacillus.  In the developing world, more women of
childbearing age die from TB than from causes directly associated with
pregnancy and childbirth.  The death of adults in their prime, who are
parents, community leaders and producers in most societies, causes a
particularly onerous burden besides being a serious public health problem.  In
the poorest countries, where the magnitude of the TB problem is greatest,
those TB control strategies that are economically feasible tend to be less
effective.  Therefore, in low and middle income countries, cost-effectiveness
considerations aimed at prioritizing resource allocation in the health sector
in general, and in TB control programmes in particular, are of paramount
importance.  Operationally, the main components of a TB control programme are:
(i) detection and treatment of TB; and (ii) prevention of TB through BCG
vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.  Priority should be given to ensuring that
TB patients complete their prescribed course of chemotherapy.  Adequate
treatment is the most effective way of preventing the spread of TB and the
emergence of drug resistance.  This article reviews evidence of the
effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different approaches to TB can,
particularly those that are applicable to low income countries, in both
HIV-infected and noninfected patients.  Financial implications and ways to
implement directly observed therapy for TB in large urban areas are discussed,
and the need to address some relevant operational issues is highlighted.  The
current role of chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination is also reviewed."  The

"Tuberculin Screening of Trauma Admissions at a University Hospital:  A
Preventive Strategy."  Archives of Surgery, November 1995;130(11):1223-1227.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Archives of
Surgery, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB)
infection in our trauma service population, namely, those patients who had
positive Mantoux (purified protein derivative [PPD] [tuberculin]) tests.
DESIGN:  Prospective study.  SETTING:  Trauma service at a university hospital
in Newark, NJ.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  During a 9-month period, 110 admitted
trauma patients underwent screening for TB.  Of these patients, 20 had
undergone recent PPD tests in the last 6 months, of which nine were positive.
The remaining 90 patients underwent PPD and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin
tests (anergy panel); five patients were unavailable for follow-up.  The
patients also answered questions regarding human immunodeficiency virus
status, risk factors for TB infection, and clinical symptoms.  RESULTS:  The
mean age of the study group was 34 years (age range, 13 to 69 years).
Eighty-four percent of these patients were males who belonged to the high-risk
socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups (poor, nonwhite).  The tests for 15
patients (17%) were newly discovered to be positive for PPD.  Eleven percent
of the patients with negative PPD tests were anergic, thus raising the
percentage of patients with positive PPD tests to 20%.  The human
immunodeficiency virus status was known in only 41% of the total patients.
All patients with positive PPD tests had a chest X-ray film performed; of
these patients, positive findings for TB were determined for one patient.
Another patient had evidence of abdominal TB at laparotomy.  All patients with
positive PPD tests were given appointments in the pulmonary clinic for
follow-up, and only three of 15 patients kept their appointments.
CONCLUSIONS:  Patients who were admitted to the trauma service were
predominantly young males from high-risk groups with a high incidence of TB
infection.  Their admission to the trauma service was a unique opportunity for
screening and implementing existing preventive programs."  The corresponding

culture facilities are not readily available.  It has been reported that
tuberculosis in HIV-positive persons can present with atypical clinical and
radiographic features.  The object of this study was to examine how often
atypical features occur in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative persons and
how these findings correspond to sputum-smear findings.  Detailed demographic,
clinical, and chest radiographic features of tuberculosis were assessed in 202
HIV-positive adults and 220 HIV-negative patients admitted consecutively.
Using univariate analysis, several of these features were found to be
significantly associated with being HIV-positive, but after multiple

Hepatotoxicity of Isoniazid and Rifampin in Pulmonary Tuberculosis."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November

1995;152(5):1705-1708.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "We evaluated whether elderly
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and without apparent preexisting liver
disease are at an increased risk to develop hepatotoxicity from an
isoniazid-rifampin regimen and require regular liver function tests in
comparison with younger patients.  We analyzed the data of 131 patients
treated in the period 1980-1985 of whom 64 (49%) were at least 60 yr of age.
Subsequent increases of transaminases (measured weekly for as long as 4 wk
after the start of treatment and later on when symptoms suggestive of
hepatotoxicity occurred) above baseline values were found more frequently in
the elderly (38 versus 18%, P<0.05) and were also more pronounced in them
(P<0.01).  The ratio of the highest transaminase value over the baseline value
was called the transaminase index (TI).  A TI of at least 5 was found in 22%
of elderly and 8% of younger patients (P=NS), but ratios as high as 10 were
mostly asymptomatic and always normalized progressively without treatment
adjustment.  Only symptomatic patients with a TI greater than or equal to 10
(five elderly and three younger) required temporary or definitive treatment
adjustment.  We conclude that repeated liver function test evaluations are
generally unnecessary, except for symptomatic elderly and younger patients
alike, in order to detect those with a TI greater than or equal to 10, thus
requiring drug adjustment."  The corresponding author for this study is:  M

Therapy (Hepatotoxicity)
Ozick, L.A.; Jacob, L.; Comer, G.M.; Lee, T.P.; Benzvi, J.; Donelson, S.S.;
Felton, C.P.  "Hepatotoxicity from Isoniazid and Rifampin in Inner-City AIDS
Patients."  American Journal of Gastroenterology, November

1995;90(11):1978-1980.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Gastroenterology, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity
due to isoniazid and rifampin in inner-city patients with active tuberculosis.
DESIGN:  A hospital-based review of 70 consecutive in-patients in a 770-bed,
inner-city hospital.  The patient population is primarily African-American and
Hispanic.  METHODS:  Fifty-eight men and 12 women were followed from 2-12 wk
(median 4 wk).  Patients had to be treated for at least 2 wk to be eligible
for the study.  Patients were excluded if they had been on any
anti-tuberculous or any other hepatotoxic drug during the 2-month period
before their hospitalization.  Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase,
bilirubin, and albumin were obtained at least every 2 wk.  RESULTS:
Hepatocellular toxicity, defined as AST and/or ALT greater than 200 IU/L,
occurred in eight out of 70 (11.4%) patients.  The mean age of these patients
was 38.9 yr (22-58 yr).  Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to
develop hepatotoxicity than those with any other risk factor (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS:  Baseline aminotransferases followed by monitoring may be
necessary in AIDS patients."  The corresponding author for this study is:  LA
