CANADA: OCCUPANT PROTECTION SYSTEMS The following notification 

CANADA: OCCUPANT PROTECTION SYSTEMS The following notification 
is being circulated in accordance with Article 10.6. G/TBT/Notif. 
95.354. 1. Member to Agreement notifying: CANADA. If applicable, 
name of local government involved (Articles 3.2 and 7.2): 2. Agency 
responsible: Department of Transport. 3. Notified under Article 
2.9.2. 4. Products covered (HS or CCCN where applicable, otherwise 
national tariff heading. ICS numbers may be provided in addition, 
where applicable): Occupant protection systems. 5. Title and number 
of pages of the notified document: Proposed Amendment to the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Regulations (pages 4131-4160). 6. Description of 
content: Modern technology offers two types of occupant restraint 
system: primary and supplemental. The manual three-point seat-belt 
system, which consists of a combined lap and shoulder belt anchored 
to the vehicle in three locations, offers primary protection in 
that it restrains the wearer and prevents the occupant from being 
ejected from the vehicle. Air bags, which are usually installed at 
both the driver and passenger seating positions and automatically 
deploy in the event of an accident, are designed to offer 
supplemental protection to the head, neck and chest. Manual 
seat-belt and air-bag systems are also classified as providing 
either active or passive protection because seat-belts must be 
engaged by the occupant while air bags inflate on their own. 
Research indicates that if certain design refinements made to 
occupant protection systems over the last decade were available on 
all vehicles, many of the head, chest, and abdominal injuries that 
occur on Canadian roadways could be avoided. (1) It is now possible 
to prevent the driver's head from hitting the steering assembly; to 
significantly reduce the force of head impacts with the A-pillars, 
dashboard, and windshield; and to minimize the chest and abdominal 
injuries caused by incorrectly positioned seat-belts. (2) Many 
currently available occupant restraint systems already offer such 
protection; however, in order to ensure that all seat-belt and 
air-bag systems provide the highest practicable margin of safety, 
it is necessary that the legislation governing these systems be 
kept current. 7. Objective and rationale: Protection of human 
safety. 8. Relevant documents: Canada Gazette, Part I, 2 December 
1995. 9. Proposed date of adoption and entry into force: 1 
September 1997. 10. Final date for comments: 1 March 1996. (363)
