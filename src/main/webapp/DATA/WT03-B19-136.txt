<b>Japan Market Entry Program</b>
</FONT><br>
</center>
<p><br>
<p><br><p>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>
To provide a range of marketing services to Victorian companies
seeking to enter the Japanese market.
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>
The Japan Program, through the Victorian Government Business Office
in Tokyo, offers a comprehensive marketing package for exporters
and directly promotes Victorian products to potential Japanese
importers.
<P>
The Program works closely with related organisations such as Austrade,
Export Access, AusIndustry, the Australia Japan Society, the Japan
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Japanese External Trade Organisation
and other branches of the State Government.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Four trade services are offered through the Japan Market Entry
Program:
<H2>Targeted marketing</H2>
<P>
Victorian companies are selected for this program based on the
nature and potential size of their exports.  Clients receive market
research information, a targeted marketing proposal, direct marketing
of the project through our Tokyo office, and follow-up support
from the Tokyo and Melbourne offices.
<H2>Reactive marketing</H2>
<P>
This service is provided to companies that have completed other
marketing activities with the Japan Program, or are unlikely to
receive significant export orders.  In this category marketing
is to existing Japanese clients and usually in response to specific
inquiries from Japanese buyers.
<H2>Cluster marketing</H2>
<P>
Companies that are likely to attract relatively small orders are
placed into product groups and marketed collectively.
<P>
This enables resources to be used more effectively which increases
the marketing impact for the company.
<H2>Incidental support</H2>
<P>
On occasion, companies not formally enrolled in the Japan Market
Entry Program, or previously enrolled, receive assistance.  It
may involve the provision of advice and business contacts, assistance
in planning an itinerary in Japan, or inclusion in promotional
activities, and is usually on a &quot;one off&quot; basis.
<P>
The Japan Program also provides support for selected trade fairs
and trade missions.
<H2>Users</H2>
<P>
Victorian processors and manufacturers without sufficient resources
to enter the Japanese market alone.
<H2>Funding</H2>
<P>
Funding for the Japan Market Entry Program is provided through
the existing budget allocation for the Japan Program.
<P>
Specific firms may apply for funding through other Business Victoria
programs such as trade fairs and missions and/or Auslndustry.
<H2>Outcomes</H2>
<P>
To increase the level and range of exports by Victorian firms
to Japan.
