<H2>VEGETATION AND POLLUTION IN THE ARCTIC </H2>
<BR>

Arctic forest and, especially, tundra ecosystems are particularly
vulnerable to the effects of surface and airborne industrial pollution,
with low tolerance and long regeneration times. The diversity of
vegetation species in the Arctic is generally low, and the potential for
significant loss of biodiversity is consequently high. In some areas, the
loss of habitat (for example, for reindeer and migratory birds) is also of
great importance. In the former Soviet Union problems of this type are
widespread.  Exploitation of the considerable mineral resources of the
northern regions at first paid little regard to the environmental
consequences, later suppressed information about them. Since shortly
before the dissolution of the Soviet Union a growing awareness of and
official concern about these problems has developed. However, attempts to
address the environmental problems from within Russia are hindered by
great uncertainty as to the scale of the problem (many of the affected
areas being remote and inaccessible) and by economic constraints. 
<BR>
<BR> 
These factors have led the <a href="rsghome.htm">RSG</a> to develop a
programme of research into the potential for satellite and airborne remote
sensing to study the phenomena of Arctic surface and airborne pollution
effects. The first stage is a study of damage to upland lichen tundra
vegetation on the <a href="kola.htm">Kola Peninsula</a> of Russia as a
result of huge emissions of sulphur dioxide from the <a href="moncheg.htm">nickel smelter</a> at
Monchegorsk. This project has been undertaken in collaboration with the
Geography Faculty of 
<a href="http://www.rector.msu.su/General/General.html">Moscow State
University</a>, with funding from the UK Department of the Environment's
'Darwin Initiative' for biodiversity. Analysis of visible and
near-infrared LANDSAT images, covering the period from 1980 to 1992, has
been combined with a detailed <a href="tuly_mon.htm">field investigation</a> to map the changes in
<a href="class.htm">vegetation distribution</a> , especially stressed
and damaged lichen tundra. The results show a decrease of almost 50% in
the area of healthy tundra, from 960 to 520 square kilometres, between
1980 and 1992, with most of the change occurring after 1989. Although this
research is still active, we currently believe that the recent massive
growth of the damaged area is a result of a change in local weather
patterns. This project is closely linked to the 
<a href="http://www.wcmc.org.uk/index.html">World Conservation Monitoring
Centre</a>'s environmental database for the Russian Arctic. It is now
being extended to study the effects of sulphur dioxide emissions
(currently about 2 million tonnes a year) from the nickel smelter at <a
href="norilsk.htm">Norilsk</a> on the Taimyr Peninsula of Russia, again in
collaboration with Moscow State University.

The second stage is to develop remote sensing/GIS methods for the study of
oil spills on frozen ground. Oil pipelines in permafrost regions are very
susceptible to damage from mechanical stresses, and large spills
<b>(images coming soon)</b> are not uncommon in the Russian north.  Little
is currently known about the behaviour of oil spilled onto permafrost, and
we are working with the Geotechnical Science Laboratories of <a
href="http://www.earthsci.carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>, Ottawa,
to develop methods for monitoring and prediction of both the spill itself,
and the post-spill situation, based on data from a wide range of spatial
scales, from the microstructural to the kilometric. Such methods should
have a major impact on the identification of appropriate remediation
strategies. 
<hr>

The techniques currently under development for monitoring healthy,
stressed and damaged Arctic vegetation also have important potential
applications in the social sciences and to climate change studies.
Indigenous people in the Russian north are heavily dependent on the tundra
vegetation which provides grazing for reindeer, and changes in vegetation
patterns can have profound effects on the way of life of these people. 
This is the subject of a collaboration with the <b>Social Science
Group</b> of the Scott Polar Research Institute. Global climate change can
also be expected to cause long-term changes in the spatial distribution of
vegetation. Monitoring of these changes from satellite data will provide
another approach to the study of global climate change.
