Junior year. Years ago it was considered the best year in high school -
those gawky years were all but forgotten but it was still too soon to
fret about college. Unfortunately, that's not the case today - at least
not for the parents of a high school junior. In fact, some financial
planning should take place when the student is a sophomore.
<BR><BR>

The year before a student heads for college is the pivotal year used by
many financial aid officers to determine financial aid eligibility. Your
income and assets will be reviewed each year but the so-called first
base income year is the one that sets the precedent. The base year
starts on January 1 of the student's junior year to December 31 of that
year (when, if all has gone well, the student is halfway through senior
year).
<BR><BR>

The following are a few tips from the <I>Detroit News-Free Press</I> on how to
improve your chances for qualifying for aid:
<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> Cash in U.S. savings bonds earmarked for college before the base
income year begins. Once the cash is in the bank, it's considered an
asset, not income. Financial aid offices expect parents to devote as
much as 47 percent of their income to college but only 5.65 percent of
their assets.
<LI> If you usually get large income tax refunds, reduce your withholding
the year before the base income year. Refunds show up as income the
following year for taxpayers who itemize.
<LI> Try to have bonuses paid in a year other than the base income year.
Avoid all pension or IRA distributions.
