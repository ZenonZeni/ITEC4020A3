<a name="RTFToC2">
Senate Tackles Illegal
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>On May 2, the Senate voted 97-3 to approve a measure (S164) aimed at
reducing illegal immigration.  A similar House bill approved in March 1996 by a
vote of 333-87 will be reconciled with the Senate bill in a conference
committee.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Senate took up bills to reform illegal (S 1664) and legal (S 1665)
immigration on April 15, 1996.  The scheduled three-day debate was halted April
16 when Democrats demanded votes on amendments to immigration reform
legislation that would bar the use of Social Security trust funds to balance
the budget, and increase the minimum wage from the current $4.25 hourly to
$5.15.  On April 24, the Senate resumed debate on the bill to reduce illegal
immigration, with the final vote on May 2. </tt><p>
<tt>Two issues that came up in the House-approved bill in March 1996 did not
come up in the Senate bill--farmers did not offer an amendment for a guest
worker program, and no amendment was offered to deny K-12 education to illegal
alien children. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  To deter illegal immigration, Simpson's bill
would double the number of Border Patrol agents to 10,000, speed the
deportation of criminal aliens, and call for a triple-tier, 14-mile-long fence
along the border with Mexico south of San Diego.</tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service would be required to conduct
pilot programs to test systems that would allow employers to verify the legal
status of newly hired workers--a provision that many called the "heart and
soul" of US efforts to reduce illegal immigration.  An amendment to strike the
pilot projects, on the grounds that they will lead to a national identity card,
were defeated by a 54-46 vote on May 1. </tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would also require states to issue birth certificates and
drivers' licenses that include Social Security numbers and meet federal
anti-counterfeiting standards, deny welfare and other assistance to
unauthorized immigrants, non-immigrants, and PRUCOL residents, and define
"public charge" for the purpose of being deportable from the US as receiving
welfare assistance for 12 or more months in any five-year period. </tt><p>
<tt>Under current law, legal immigrants have limited access to Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, and the Supplemental Security Income
program for the disabled.  If an immigrant applies for these benefits, and was
sponsored by a US relative, then the US sponsor's income is counted or deemed
to be available to the immigrant, making many immigrants ineligible.</tt><p>
<tt>The major fight in the Senate was how long to deem that the income of
sponsors be available to immigrants, and to which assistance programs deeming
should apply.  Simpson proposed that deeming continue until an immigrant had 40
quarters of employment (10 years) employment in the US; amendments reduced the
deeming period to five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Amendments to limit deeming to cash assistance programs, or to exempt from
deeming federal assistance for higher education, or to exempt from deeming
applicants for assistance who were veterans of the US Armed Forces, or pregnant
women, all failed, mostly by votes of about 55 to 45.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate bill, as introduced by Simpson, would have restored the
authority of Border Patrol agents to enter open agricultural fields and check
for unauthorized workers--until 1986, the Border Patrol routinely drove into
fields and attempted to apprehend fleeing aliens.  The Senate voted 79-20 to
keep the ban on open field searches on April 24.</tt><p>
<tt>The House of Representatives did not alter the current requirement that the
Border Patrol must obtain a search warrant to enter open fields.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 30, the Senate voted 62-37 to allow the 1966 Cuban Refugee
Adjustment Act to remain US law until Cuba has a democratic government.  Under
the Act, Cubans apply for permanent resident status after living in the United
States for a year, regardless of whether they arrived legally or illegally.
Cubans are the only foreigners granted such automatic US immigrant
status.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would have permitted INS asylum officers, with approval of
their supervisors, to exclude asylum applicants who arrive in the US with false
documents or no documents, but the Senate approved an amendment by a vote of
51-49 to substitute Attorney General discretion for dealing with asylum seekers
at ports of entry (see article on terrorism/asylum below).</tt><p>
<tt><u>Legal Immigration.</u>  "There will be no changes to legal immigration
in 1996."  This seemed to be the consensus after the Senate rebuffed by wide
margins efforts to restrict legal immigration--the House bill approved in March
1996 does not change the legal immigration system.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 25, Simpson offered an amendment to the illegal immigration bill
to reduce legal immigration by 10 percent for five years to provide the US with
"breathing space" to absorb newcomers--his amendment was defeated by an 80-20
vote after six hours of debate.  An effort by Senator Feinstein (D-CA) to cap
legal family immigration at 480,000 was also defeated by a vote of
74-26.</tt><p>
<tt>The legal immigration bill as introduced by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)
would have reduced legal immigration by 25 percent by eliminating slots for the
adult sons and daughters, and adult brothers and sisters, of US citizens.
However, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the Kennedy-Abraham amendment
that would restructure the family unification system.  Spouses, minor children,
and parents of US citizens could continue to enter the US without restriction,
but the current 226,000 per year visas available for family unification would
be reduced to 175,000.  The preferences would change to be 1)  the spouses and
minor children of legal immigrants; 2) the unmarried adult sons and daughters
of US citizens; 3) the married sons and daughters of US citizens; 4) the
unmarried children of permanent immigrants and, finally; 5) the adult brothers
and sisters of US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>These proposed changes would likely increase rather than decrease family
unification immigration, largely because over 1.3 million spouses and children
of legal immigrants are currently waiting to immigrate--in many cases they are
already here illegally.  They will be able to come in as the immediate family
members of US citizens as their SAW-eligible fathers become naturalized
citizens.  This means that the "immediate family" backlog for immigrants is
likely to be sharply reduced by 1997-98.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 720,461 legal immigrants in FY95, including 507,000 family
unification immigrants, a sharp drop from 1993 and 1994.  The INS was accused
of releasing the FY95 immigration numbers late in March in support of efforts
to separate legal and illegal immigration, thus leaving the legal immigration
system intact, even though it expected an increase, to 650,000, in the number
of family unification immigrants in FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS was sharply criticized for implying that legal immigration would
continue to decline when its internal projections showed that legal immigration
would increase.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Simpson also proposed significant changes to systems through which
US employers secure permanent and temporary immigrants to fill vacant US
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Reaction</u>.  Several police organizations attacked a provision in the
House-approved immigration bill that would permit states to deny public
education to illegal alien children without cost.  President Clinton has
promised to veto any immigration bill that includes the denial of education
provision.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) supports the House provision, which mirrors Prop.
187's denial of K-12 schooling of illegal alien children.  House Speaker
Gingrich supported the measure in the House.  The Clinton administration has
also vowed to veto any immigration reform the Prop-187 measure excluding
illegal alien children from US public schools.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Immigrant
Beatings</a>, Numbers and
Naturalization</a></></a></h2>
<tt>On April 1, two white Riverside county sheriff's deputies were taped
beating two unauthorized Mexican aliens who had led them on an 80 mile
high-speed chase after trying to evade an Immigration and Naturalization
Service checkpoint in southern California.  The aliens who were beaten were in
the cab of a pickup truck that had 18 aliens crammed under a camper
shell.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS stopped chasing illegal immigrants attempting to evade them after a
1992 chase killed several innocent bystanders by a southern California
school.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 4, the two immigrants who were beaten filed a $70 million lawsuit
against Riverside county, and were offered a place to stay by actor Marlon
Brando.  The lawyer for one of the immigrants said that if the claim was
rejected, he would file suit in federal court alleging violations of the United
Nations' conventions against torture.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Mexican migrants were from Cheran, an emigration village about
30,000 people in Michoacan, half-way between Guadalajara and Mexico City where
daily wages average $3 to $7.  An estimated 7,000 persons born in the village
are now in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>In another incident, a stolen camper with 26 unauthorized aliens crashed on
April 6 attempting to evade the Border Patrol, killing seven.  One of those
injured was a Mexican national being paid $200 to guide the illegal aliens
around a Border Patrol checkpoint to Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrant rights groups protested the beatings, calling them the "Rodney
King" incident that may wake up the nation to violence against illegal
immigrants in the same way that the 1991 tape of police beating of King
illustrated police violence against African Americans.  Several groups asserted
that hate crimes and police beatings of immigrants have increased since Prop.
187 was approved by voters in November 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were several demonstrations in Los Angeles, including a march of
6,000 people on April 6, 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>A counter demonstration in support of law enforcement was organized by many
of the groups that supported Proposition 187.  They argued that immigration
rights advocates were trying to use the beatings to discourage Congress from
enacting new measures to curb illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>A member of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights said that the illegal
immigrants who were beaten had been promised work permits by federal
immigration officials.  The INS said that, like the case of the Thai workers
held in slavery conditions, the immigrants may be given work permits if they
are needed as material witnesses in the investigations.  The immigrants will be
allowed to remain in the country for six months while the investigation is
being conducted.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico took the lead in denouncing the beatings.  President Zedillo on
April 16 called the beatings on unauthorized aliens "totally unjustified," and
the protests in the US against the beatings "totally justified."  Zedillo
announced that he will ask for an international conference to endorse the human
rights of migrants and their families. </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's Congress called for an exhaustive study of "aggressive violations
of human rights" in the US.  All four parties in the Mexican Congress passed
binding resolutions requiring the government to publish a detailed list of
human rights violations committed against Mexicans in the US over the past five
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican network Televisa led its newscasts with the beating story the
entire first week of April, and several Mexican politicians spoke of a US "war"
against Mexicans.  Mexican television commentators referred to those beaten not
as criminals, but as poverty-stricken people searching for work to care for
their families. </tt><p>
<tt>Other Mexicans said that Mexican anger should be directed against the
Mexican government, because it failed to create an economy that offers enough
jobs in Mexico.  On April 10, there was a videotaped police killing of Mexicans
in Olmedo, Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>A poll taken April 8-9 by the Reforma newspaper found that 61 percent of
the respondents in Mexico City and Monterry were not satisfied with the
response of the Mexican government.  Almost half of the Mexicans polled do not
think that the US justice system will punish the Riverside County sheriff's
deputies. </tt><p>
<tt>The Reforma and El Norte newspapers conducted another poll April 13 to 17,
1996 of 465 Mexicans in Mexico who had been apprehended and removed from the US
by the INS. The poll found that 51 percent of the Mexicans described their
treatment by the INS as "good."  Another 34 percent said their treatment was
"regular;" some said that the INS agents had used abusive or disrespectful
language in dealing with them.</tt><p>
<tt>About 13 percent--one in eight--reported that they had been treated poorly;
their complaints included beatings and prolonged detention.  The questions were
asked on the Mexican side of the border as the Mexicans were returned from the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The survey also asked Mexicans how they got into the US.  Most Mexicans
tried to enter the US without a smuggler-- 71 percent.  Most--67 percent--said
that they tried to enter the US illegally because they were jobless in Mexico,
and 36 percent were going to seek jobs in US agriculture, followed by 25
percent seeking jobs in construction.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexicans polled as they were being returned from the US, reported that
they earned an average $278 per week in the US in their last job, versus $31
per week in their last Mexican job.  Almost all of the Mexicans apprehended
reported that they sent money to their families--they had an average four
dependents in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>The survey respondents reported that 61 percent of their US employers
treated them "well" or "very well," 32 percent said their treatment was
"regular," and only two percent reported US employer mistreatment.  Most of
those surveyed felt more comfortable in Mexico than in the US, primarily
because of their lack of English.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexicans apprehended had an average 6.4 years of Mexican
education.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives from Mexico and the US government agreed on April 14 to a
series of steps aimed at easing tensions at the US-Mexico border, including
reviews of police procedures in towns along the US side of the border, and a
continuation of presentations by Mexican officials to US Border Patrol
agents.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Enforcement</u>.   The INS reported that it had detained 1,176 foreign
workers  from 32 countries at more than 100 businesses between March 18 and
April 12 in 19 eastern states.</tt><p>
<tt>A report by the TransBorder Institute at the University of San Diego found
that most of the 540 San Diego residents responding to the telephone survey in
early March want to strengthen US border controls.  A slight majority of the
self-identified Republicans, and a substantial majority of the Democrats, would
provide social services to illegal immigrants.  Republicans favored employer
sanctions 8-to-1, while Democrats supported sanctions 3-to-1.  </tt><p>
<tt>In south Texas, the INS reported a ten-fold increase in December 1995 from
the usual 10 to 15 families each month that attempt illegal entry into the US
after smugglers advised entrants that the INS does not detain families.  Since
the mid-1980s, the INS has released into the US aliens apprehended with minor
children; even though most such aliens give false names and addresses and
disappear.  </tt><p>
<tt>As word of the INS policy spread, some adults "rented" children to ensure
that if caught by the INS, they would be released. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS is reporting increasing arrests and deportation from the country's
interior.  In March 1996, some 86 vehicles carrying 1,300 aliens were stopped
in Colorado during "Operation Mountain Pass."  As in other operations, the INS
stressed that it was going after the "inhumane" and exploitative smugglers, not
the employers where the aliens hoped to get jobs, or the aliens
themselves.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 1,000 illegal aliens were arrested during a sweep of 100 businesses in
the eastern United States between March 18 and April 12.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Justice inspector general found that of the more than
half of the noncriminal illegal aliens apprehended in 1994 were still in the US
at the end of the year.  Based on a sampling of cases, the Department of
Justice estimates that the INS deported just 11 percent of the immigrants who
were not kept in custody after they were ordered deported.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS generally sends a letter requesting that the person appear for
deportation, the so-called "run letter." The INS blames its inability to deport
noncriminal aliens to insufficient resources to detain them.</tt><p>
<tt>The federal government has 41,000 law enforcement personnel, spread over 32
agencies, including 6,000 Border Patrol officers.  There are about 102,000
persons working in federal prisons.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Naturalization</u>.  The number of foreigners applying to become
naturalized US citizens increased from 340,000 in 1992 to 592,000 in 1994, and
is expected to top one million in 1995 and 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration service expects one million applications in 1996.  The INS
launched a pilot program in Chicago in October 1995 to expedite the test that
immigrants must take to become naturalized US citizens.  Exams have multiple
choice questions, and oral interviews last 10 minutes.  Applicants are given
five sample multiple choice tests, a standardized list of 100 possible
questions, and a list of vocabulary study words.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">DOL
Reports on Temporary
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The US Department of Labor's inspector general in April released an
12-state audit of DOL labor certification activities that concluded that
"foreign labor programs [that admit temporary and permanent immigrants to fill
vacant US jobs]...do not protect US workers' jobs or wages from foreign labor."
The audit recommends that the temporary foreign professionals program, the H-1B
program established by IMMACT in 1990, be abolished.</tt><p>
<tt>The US permits the entry of foreign workers to fill vacant jobs when US
workers are not available.  However, many labor economists have noted that it
is very difficult for the government to second-guess an employer who asserts
that a foreigner is more qualified to fill a vacancy than a US worker, so that
the US government typically establishes minimum wage and other criteria that a
US employer requesting foreign workers must satisfy, and then the government
depends on US worker complaints to ensure that employers live up to their
commitments.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Temporary</u>. The H-1B program came under attack in Congressional
hearings in 1995 (MN, October 1995), and in the DOL inspector general's report.
The H-1B program permits up to 65,000 "professionals" in "specialty
occupations" to enter the US each year for three years, and then their US
employers can request the renewal of H-1B work permits for another three years.
</tt><p>
<tt>US employers open the border gate to H-1B foreign workers by "attesting" in
a labor condition application filed with the Department of Labor that they have
tried and failed to find US citizens and legal immigrants by offering
prevailing wages.  DOL must approve their request for temporary foreign workers
unless it is "obviously inaccurate."   </tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the program is to permit US employers "to meet urgent,
short-term demand for highly skilled, unique individuals who are not available"
in the US.  The jobs that H-1B foreign workers are imported to fill must
require professional skills, which is usually interpreted to mean that the
individual filling them must have a BS/BA--it is not enough that the foreign
worker has a BS/BA, the job must require such a degree.  This leads to
confusion in occupations such as nursing--many Filipinas have BS degrees, but
nursing in the US does not require a BS.</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that 40 percent of the new H-1B visa approvals are for
high-tech jobs such as computer programmers.  Enforcement depends largely on
complaints from competing US workers and businesses.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the inspector general's report, the H-1B is in reality "a
probationary employment tryout program for illegal aliens, foreign students,
and foreign visitors."  If the foreigners turn out to be good workers, then the
US employer often sponsors them for permanent immigrant status.  </tt><p>
<tt>In many cases, US employers do not pay the prevailing wages to the H-1B
workers that they promise in their attestations.  One company said that it was
offering US workers, and paying foreigners, $2,800 per month, but in fact paid
the foreigners it hired only $500 per month.  DOL is requiring 14 companies to
pay $2 million in back wages to 400 foreign physical therapists for wages that
they did not receive since 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>About 60,000 H-1B temporary foreign workers are admitted each year and,
because each H-1B can remain in the US for up to six years, there can be almost
400,000 H-1B workers in the US at any one time.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 43,000 visas issued by the US Department of State to H-1B
workers in FY94, and the INS reported that there were 106,000 admissions of
H-1B workers in FY94--an INS admission occurs each time that an H-1B worker
with a multi-year visa enters the US.</tt><p>
<tt>According to INS data, there were 186,000 temporary workers and trainees
admitted to the US in FY94, plus 43,000 spouses and children of these
workers.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Permanent.</u>  The US permits a maximum 140,000 immigrants (including
their family members) to come to the US each year for employment/economic
reasons.  An audit of employers who requested 24,000 permanent immigration
visas for foreigners to fill vacant jobs in FY93 found that 99 percent of the
foreigners were already in the US when the US employer requested the foreign
worker, and that 74 percent of the foreigners were already employed by the
employer requesting them, including 16 percent who were employed illegally by
their sponsoring employer.</tt><p>
<tt>About 10 percent of the foreigners who became permanent immigrants on the
grounds that no US worker was available to fill the vacant job ever worked for
the US employer who sponsored the foreigner, and 17 percent of those receiving
employment/economic immigration visas worked for less than six months with the
sponsoring employer.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 165,000 US workers applied for these 24,000 jobs when the employer
advertised as required--almost seven US applicants per job--but in virtually
every case, the US workers were found not qualified, and the foreigners were
hired.  The audit also found that although immigrants enter the US attached to
a specific job, once in the US, they look for more lucrative jobs competing
with US workers without regard to prevailing wages.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Wall Street Journal profiled George Borjas on April 26, 1996, a
Harvard-economist who emigrated from Cuba as a child and now advocates less
unskilled immigration.  The story summarized the Chiswick-Borjas debate over
whether immigrants catch up in earnings to similar US workers within 10 to 15
years--Chiswick found that those arriving prior to 1970 did catch up, Borjas
stresses that those who arrived after 1990 are unlikely to earn as much as
similar US-born residents. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Outlook. </u> Senators Simpson (R-WY) and Kennedy (D-MA) agreed with the
Clinton administration that major changes were needed in the H-1B and permanent
immigration for employment programs during Congressional hearings in 1995, but
a coalition of high-tech businesses and immigration advocates blocked proposed
changes.  </tt><p>
<tt>The House bill approved in March 1996 would require companies that
dismissed American workers to hire H-1B workers to pay the temporary foreign
replacement workers 10 percent more than the prevailing wage, and increase
fines for violations from the current $1,000 to $5,000 per violation.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 140,000 permanent immigrant visas available annually, and 123,000
permanent immigrant visas were issued to needed foreign workers  and their
dependents in FY94.   </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">California</a>:
Initiatives and
Wages</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>In California, one proposition qualified for the November 1996 ballot, and
one did not.  The California Civil Rights Initiative qualified for the ballot,
with over one million signatures, but the identification initiative, Save Our
State II, did not. </tt><p>
<tt>Save Our State II would have required all applicants for welfare payments
or other government benefits in California to present state-issued
identification cards proving their US citizenship or legal residency, all
persons born in California to be fingerprinted at birth, and all birth
certificates to contain information regarding the residency status of the
baby's mother.</tt><p>
<tt>In San Francisco, a proposed initiative to give noncitizens the right to
vote in local elections was prevented from circulating for signatures by a
judge who said that non-citizen voting would violate the California
constitution.  The judge's ruling seems to also invalidate a plan to permit
non-US citizen legal immigrants to vote in school board elections. </tt><p>
<tt>Supporters and proponents of unauthorized aliens in 1994 argued over its
likely effects on legal and illegal aliens, and in April, UC researchers
reported that young Latinos with mental illnesses in the Bay Area reduced by
one-fourth their outpatient clinic visits, and increased their usage of
emergency medical services.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bilingual education came under attack in many newspapers recently.  In many
schools, children who speak Spanish and other foreign languages are segregated
from other children.  Many school districts are beginning to immerse
non-English speaking students in English classes, and reporting that the
students learn English and other subjects faster than if they are placed in
classes in which math and other subjects are taught in their native
languages.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, state law requires non-English speaking children to be
taught in their own language until they learn enough English to transition into
regular classes taught in English.  However, the percentage of K-12 children
who transition from native language to regular classes has been falling--only
five percent of the California's limited English proficient students made the
move into regular classes in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, parents of children placed in native-language classes have
protested that their children are not learning enough English to be
economically successful.</tt><p>
<tt>California has 1.2 million K-12 students who speak little or no English,
and on April 10, 1996, the Assembly Education Committee approved a bill that
would give local school districts the authority to decide how to integrate
non-English speaking children into regular classrooms.  MALDEF, the bilingual
teachers' association, and the California Department of Education are likely to
oppose giving local school districts more flexibility in deciding how to
integrate non-English speaking students.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, a union-led effort to raise the state's minimum wage from
$4.25 hourly to $5 on March 1, 1995, and to $5.75 on March 1, 1998, qualified
for the November 1996 ballot, and is expected to be approved by voters--a
January 1996 poll found that 84 percent of Americans favor raising the minimum
wage.  There are 43 states with state minimum wage laws, and 10 have
established minimum wages above the federal minimum wage, including Hawaii with
a minimum wage of $5.25 per hour.`</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 3.7 million US workers earning the $4.25 minimum wage--by
one estimate, they receive one percent of US wages--and 10 million more who
earn $4.25 to $5.15 per hour--including 1.5 million in California.  About 54
percent of the minimum wage workers are under 25, including 37 percent of those
under 20.</tt><p>
<tt>It appears that the Republican-dominated Congress will permit a vote on
raising the minimum wage to $5.25 by 1998 in May 1996, and that this increase
will be approved.</tt><p>
<tt>The 72 Thai workers found to be imprisoned in a Los Angeles sweatshop in
August 1995 have received $1 million in wages from their former
employers--seven Thais--and the clothing companies that bought the clothes sewn
there.  Lawyers for the 72 workers are seeking $5 million in civil suits
against retailers who bought clothes from the sweatshop.  Two of the operators
of the sweatshop were sentenced to prison in April 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>After peaking at 20.2 million in 1993, the number of California driver's
licenses fell to 19.1 million in 1995.  Usually, one driver's license
represents two people in the states, so this data would suggest that 2.2
million people left the state.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is among the explanations offered for the apparent discrepancy
between the increased number of residents and jobs and the decreased number of
driver's licenses.  A 1994 California law required applicants for driver's
licenses to show proof that they are legal US residents.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Florida's
Growth,
Arizona</a><a>'s
Prop. 187</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Florida is currently the fourth most populous state, with 14 million
residents, and is projected to grow to 17-18 million by 2010, and to 22 million
by 2020.  According to a new study from the Center for Immigration Studies,
immigrants and their children account for 30 percent of the state's population
growth.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 45 percent of Dade County's two million residents were born abroad,
making Dade County the US county with the highest percentage of foreign born
residents--almost 30 percent of the county's residents are not US citizens.
The county's residents include 669,000 persons of Cuban origin; 110,000,
Haitians; 74,000, Nicaraguans; 54,000, Colombians; 23,000, Mexicans; 23,000,
Dominicans; 18,000, Hondurans, and; 16,000, Peruvians.</tt><p>
<tt>Miami is the only large US city with an Hispanic majority, and most of the
20,000 Cubans permitted to enter the US each year settle in Miami.  There are
sometimes tensions between US-born Blacks and Haitians because the Haitians are
doing better--the unemployment rate in Little Haiti is 42 percent, but that is
still lower than in nearby African-American neighborhoods.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants in Florida (compared to
some two million in California), and Florida voters are expected to vote on an
initiative similar to California's Proposition 187 in November 1996 that would
deny many social services and education to illegal aliens.  Democratic Gov.
Lawton Chiles opposes the measure, although Florida sued the federal government
in April 1994 for $1 billion per year to cover it said represented the costs to
the state of providing services to illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>According to INS, about 45 percent of the 33,000 aliens apprehended in
Florida since 1992 said they were smuggled into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A campaign to place a Prop. 187-type initiative on the November 1996
Arizona ballot began in March, 1996.  The proposed measure would cut off all
government aid to illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>Ron Prince, who chaired California's Prop. 187 campaign, moved to Arizona
to coordinate the efforts there.  Organizers need 112,961 signatures by July 3,
1996 in order to place the measure on the ballot.  </tt><p>
<tt>On March 25, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear in the fall of 1996 an
appeal by Arizonians for Official English to reinstate the Arizona
constitutional amendment that would make English the official government
language.  The amendment was approved by Arizona voters as in 1988.</tt><p>
<tt>The Arizona amendment, Article 28, was challenged by a state employee who
wrote her reports in Spanish for a non-English speaking supervisor, and federal
courts in 1990 and 1995 held that the amendment violated the first amendment
free speech rights of public employees and the people they serve.</tt><p>
<tt>Arizona decided not to appeal these court decisions, so the appeal is being
carried by Arizonians for Official English.  A Supreme Court ruling could deal
with the validity of English-only amendments in the 21 states with them, and
with the right of private groups to sue to enforce initiatives that states
decide not to defend.</tt><p>

<tt>In 1995, about 3,300 aliens arrived in the US without documents and sought
asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrant rights groups argued that the "enter illegally" provisions that
could lead to exclusion from the US might be used to exclude millions of aliens
apprehended after illegal entry.  Most of the aliens apprehended by the Border
Patrol are fingerprinted and photographed, and then allowed to "voluntarily
return" to Mexico.  Under some interpretations of the anti-terrorism bill, an
asylum officer could exclude such aliens from the US without offering them a
deportation hearing, the current practice.</tt><p>
<tt>A deportation hearing is a more formal judicial proceeding in which the
burden of proof is on the US government to show why the alien should not be
allowed to stay in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 1, the Senate by a 51 to 49 vote substituted Attorney General
discretion for the terrorism and Simpson bills' summary exclusion provisions.
The Senate-approved amendment would permit administrative review of an asylum
officer's decision to exclude an asylum seeker who arrives without documents.
The House-approved bill permits summary exclusion, so the issue will be decided
in the House-Senate conference committee.</tt><p>
<tt>As the anti-terrorism law went into effect in late April, the INS began
detaining illegal aliens who had been convicted of crimes in the US as they
left prison.  Past practice was to allow such aliens to post bond while they
appealed deportation orders, and permitted immigration judges to permit the
aliens to remain in the US if they were in the US at least seven years and have
employment and family ties here.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Chinese women who object to the one-child policy have been able to win
asylum in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On May 2, 1996, the US Board of Immigration Appeals will hear the appeal of
an African woman who in 1994 requested asylum in the US because she would have
faced genital mutilation in her native Togo.  Foreigners can request asylum in
the US if they face a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race,
religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group; the
woman argues that she is part of a social group--women who oppose genital
mutilation.</tt><p>
<tt>After front page stories in the New York Times on this case, the woman was
released from detention April 24.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration filed a brief in support of providing asylum for
women who have a credible fear of being forced to undergo genital mutilation as
adults.  </tt><p>
<tt>The World Health Organization estimates that 85 million to 114 million
girls and women have been mutilated in 26 African nations. The board's ruling
in this case will be binding on the nation's 179 immigration judges, who have
been divided in their handling of such cases.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the Clinton Administration told immigration officers that they
could  postpone indefinitely the deportation of women who faced forced
abortions in China, but the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that such fear
cannot justify asylum--30 Chinese women have been affected by this policy.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, guidelines were issued to help immigration officers identify women
who should get asylum because sexual violence were issued, and three women have
so far been granted asylum for fear of genital mutilation.  In March 1996,
battered spouses of US citizens were allowed to apply for immigrant status on
their own.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Independent
Mexic</a>an
Unions</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Industrial wages in Mexico are equivalent to only 50 percent of their 1982
level, but the number of strikes in Mexico is still very low--there were over
600 strikes in Mexico in 1982, 300 in 1986, but only 50 in 1995.  The Mexican
CTM, an integral part of the PRI, has five million members in 14,000 affiliated
unions--one in seven deputies in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies is a CTM
official.</tt><p>
<tt>Independent unions are becoming more aggressive.  They have about 500,000
members, but they accounted for 25 percent of all strikes in Mexico in 1995.
Some 40 independent unions have formed the Coordinator of Mexican
Workers.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 11, the semi-official Labor Congress said that it may expel nine
unions for planning an unauthorized march May 1 to protest government economic
policies, including the teachers, telephone workers, and electricians unions;
they are about 12 percent of the CTM's membership.  The CTM canceled its May 1
march, fearing unrest because of Mexico's economic crisis. </tt><p>
<tt>A new book, Bordering on Chaos, argues that Mexico could descend into
economic stagnation that would propel millions of Mexicans northward.</tt><p>
<tt>Tecun Uman, a town of 20,000 also known as Guatemala's Tijuana because of
the Central Americans who congregate there to sneak into Mexico and, often, to
the US, is reportedly filled with Central Americans who have suffered
mistreatment at the hands of the Mexican police.  One 1995 report said that
two-thirds of the migrants who had been apprehended in Mexico reported that
they were mistreated or beaten by Mexican authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican and US governments are apparently taking quiet steps to
cooperate in areas that have long been sources of tension.  For example, in
April 1996, Mexico for the first time approved US requests to extradite Mexican
nationals accused of committing crimes in the US.  According to one
commentator, the Mexican government is changing from automatically saying no to
US initiatives to embracing some of them.</tt><p>
<tt>In April, 63 Mexicans apprehended in the US were flown from San Diego to
Guadalajara, and another 450 are expected to be flown to the interior of Mexico
by July 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico announced in April that foreign firms will not be able to manage the
new private pension funds that are being established to bail out the bankrupt
public pension system.  In Chile, foreign firms manage about 70 percent of the
private pension funds.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Central
American</a>/a></a>
Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The seven countries of Central America south of Mexico are smaller, poorer,
and more rural than Mexico.  They sent about 40,000 legal immigrants to the US
in FY94--the highest rates of emigration were from Belize and El Salvador, and
the lowest was from Costa Rica.  Over 90 percent of the 1.1 million Central
American immigrants who arrived in the US since 1820 came in the last 15 years,
versus 60 percent of the Mexican immigrants.  According to unofficial
estimates, over 400,000 Central Americans enter Mexico with the intend of
traveling on to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico expels more than 70,000 illegal aliens across the Guatemalan border
each year.  Over 65 percent of the migrants arriving illegally in Mexico report
"ill treatment, beatings and threats at the hands of the authorities,"
according the official Mexican human rights commission.</tt><p>
<tt>To pass through Mexico, Central Americans must travel hundreds of miles
during a journal that can take up to three months. The cost of hiring a
smuggler to guide them through Mexico ranges from $300 to $10,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Central Americans entering Mexico become seasonal farm workers
in Chiapas.  The children of undocumented workers born in Mexico can not
receive birth certificates making it impossible to register them for school.
Mexico also denies non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants and their
children. </tt><p>
<tt>More Central Americans filed asylum cases in the US in FY94 than
immigrated, suggesting that, unlike Mexicans, many Central Americans arrive as
tourist non-immigrants and then seek to remain in the US by applying for
asylum.  </tt><p>
<tt>Several candidates for election in Nicaragua traveled to California in
early March to raise money for their campaigns among the estimated 500,000
Nicaraguans in the US.  The 1990 Census counted 203,000 Nicaraguans in the
US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">EU--Illegal
and Internal
Migration</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>Europol has declared "organized illegal immigration" to be the police<b>
</b>organization's "greatest concern."  In several countries, officials who
were assigned to go after alien smugglers have been accused of protecting them,
including several French immigration officers at Orly airport, and immigration
officials in Hamburg.  </tt><p>
<tt>Europol blames the corruption on the amount of money that can be collected
from aliens who want to enter Western Europe.  Local police can also earn a
payoff from the criminal activities--such as prostitution and drug
dealing--that many of the foreigners can be induced to engage in once they
arrive.</tt><p>
<tt>A push by the Netherlands for a collective visa, asylum and immigration
policy and a wider role for the European Court of Justices has the support of
14 of the EU member states--all but Britain.  An EU immigration policy was on
the agenda for the first of a series EU's Inter-Governmental Conferences in
Turin, Italy.  The IGC will seek to reform EU institutions and revise the 1991
Maastricht treaty.</tt><p>
<tt>After five years of debate, EU employment ministers on March 29 agreed on
the rights of EU nationals sent by their firms to work in another EU nation.
So-called "posted workers" are different from workers who cross borders on
their own to seek jobs, as e.g. Italians who migrate to Germany to seek work at
BMW, and also different from self-employed persons such as accountants who want
to offer their services in another EU nation.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the freedom of services clause of the EU treaty, many German
construction firms established subsidiaries or relationships with firms in the
UK and Portugal, hired workers there, and "posted" them to Berlin, Europe's
largest construction site, at wages that were one-fourth of prevailing German
wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the EU directive, EU workers posted in another EU country must
usually be paid the same wages as local workers from the first day of their
employment abroad, although countries can permit lower wages for the first
month.  Postings that last less than eight days would be exempt.  EU member
nations have two years to approve national implementing legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Court of Justice ruled that unemployed persons who take cash
settlements when they are laid off, can still collect family benefits.  The
ruling came as the result of a case in which a Spanish worker who had lived and
worked in Germany for 26 years, took a lump sum payment when he was laid off,
and lost his unemployment benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The court ruled that community law on social security benefits does not
distinguish between those receiving monthly unemployment benefits from those
who take a lump sum, and are therefore considered temporarily suspended from
receiving unemployment benefits by their national governments.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU labor force of 2010 is projected to rise to 180 million, and
employment to 166 million, leaving 14 million unemployed.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Germany</a>:
Bosnians, Kurds, and
Construction</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt><u>Bosnians</u>.  There are about 320,000 Bosnians living in Germany, and
they are scheduled to begin to return to Bosnia on July 1, 1996.  A poll
commissioned by the UNHCR found that 25 percent of the Bosnians in German are
ready to return, but 45 percent of the Bosnians in Germany do not feel
conditions are right for their return--an estimated 60 percent of the housing
in Bosnia has been destroyed or damaged.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has spent an estimated $10 billion on Bosnians.</tt><p>
<tt>Single Bosnians in Switzerland lost their "temporary protected status" on
April 30, 1996, and have four months to leave the country.  Families will lose
TPS April 30, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands has 45,000 Bosnians and Denmark has 17,500.</tt><p>
<tt>The German government announced on April 17 that it would send 150
policemen to Bosnia to assist the UN multinational police force deployed there.
The multinational police force will be composed of 1,700 policemen from over 30
countries. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany also provides temporary protected status for 120,000 ethnic
Albanians from Serbia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federal Interior Ministry announced that 9,121 foreigners sought asylum
in March 1996, continuing the 10,000 per month pace set so far in 1996.  Most
were nationals of Turkey, Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia), and Iraq, but
there were also 140 asylum requests from Bosnians.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 7.1 million foreigners in Germany on January 1, 1996, including
2.2 million wage and salary workers.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Aussiedler</u>.  Even though the number of ethnic Germans arriving in
Germany fell to 41,000 in the first three months of 1996, Germany continued to
debate the number of ethnic German Aussiedler that can be absorbed.  Germany
has since 1993 limited the number of Aussieder to 220,000 each year.  Upon
their arrival in Germany, Aussiedler get German language instruction, are
eligible for pensions, and become German citizens upon request. </tt><p>
<tt>About 40,000 Jews from the ex-USSR have migrated to Germany, and another
73,000 more have applied to emigrate.  One survey found that 70 percent were
university graduates, but 30 percent were jobless.  There were about 30,000
Jews in Germany until 1989.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Expulsions.</u> On March 26, the political parties in the Kohl
government discussed whether laws should be changed to permit the expulsion of
foreigners involved in illegal demonstrations.  The CDU and CSU want to give
the government the authority to immediately expel foreigners who seriously
disturb the peace (schwerer Landfriedensbruch) without first obtaining a
criminal conviction.</tt><p>
<tt>Also discussed was a reduction from five to three years the penalty that
permits foreigners to be expelled from Germany for non-political crimes.</tt><p>
<tt>The Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK has reportedly made "revenge" death
threats against German chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel.  A trial is underway in Stuttgart involving alleged PKK members who
firebombed Turkish establishments in Germany in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Turkish Studies Center in Essen reported that "blind
testing"--sending similarly qualified Turks and Germans for jobs--found that
Germans were preferred to Turks, especially in retail trade and construction.
Under Germany's anti-discrimination laws, the burden of proof is on the alien
who charges that he suffered discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Construction/Economics</u>.  German building unions and employers agreed
to a 1.85 percent wage increase on April 11, averting what would have been the
first construction strike since World War II.  The wage increases went into
effect April 1 in the former East Germany, and September 1, 1996 in East
Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Wage increases won by unions in 1995 averaged double the rate of
inflation.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 17, the Bundesbank reported that Germany's construction industry,
which has been booming for the past five years, is set for a period of
consolidation.  German building groups say that business has begun to taper off
amid tough competition from low-wage foreign competitors. </tt><p>
<tt>Under a new law, EU workers sent by their employers to Germany must be paid
at least minimum wages DM 18.60 marks ($12.40) per hour in former West Germany,
and DM17.11 marks ($11.4) in East Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The German labor force in 1996 is 34.4 million, and unemployment was 4.1
million in March 1996, or 10.8 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In one in 10 German families, both parents are unemployed.  The Federal
Labor Office in Germany reported on March 6 that the unadjusted unemployment
rate in the west rose to 9.6 percent from 9.4 percent in January.  In eastern
Germany, the unemployment rate was 17.5 in February, up from 16.8 percent in
January.  The combined data for eastern and western Germany shows unemployment
at 11.1 percent in February, up from 10.8 percent in January.</tt><p>
<tt>Economists blame some of the rise in unemployment on the exceptionally cold
weather in February, and the tendency of construction employers to lay off
workers and have them collect UI benefits rather than making privately funded
"bad weather" payments.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bundesbank reported that social support--akin to US General
Assistance-- doubled from DM 21 billion in 1985 to DM 43 ($29) billion in 1994.
Social support is the paid as a last resort to guarantee a minimum living
standard to the disabled (Hilfe in besonderen Lebenslagen) and to persons
capable of working (Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt)--about two-thirds of the social
assistance is paid to "besondere Lebenslagen" disabled persons.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, about 1.5 million persons in the former West Germany received
Lebensunterhalt, and almost half of them were foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Local governments pay about three-quarters of the social support and the
increase has made it difficult for them to reduce their budget deficits.  In
former west Germany, payments remained steady for asylum seekers in 1994
because of a change in the rules governing benefits.  In 1995, welfare benefit
payments by municipalities increased by 9.4 percent in all of Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>The Kohl government announced plans at the end of April to reduce social
spending by $16 billion in 1997, largely by reducing social assistance
payments.  For example, sick pay, which is currently 100 percent of a worker's
salary for six weeks, would be cut by 20 percent, and the retirement age for
women would be raised from 60 to 63.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">French
Commission Recommends Immigration
Restrictions</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>A parliamentary commission on April 21 called for a tightening of the
country's immigration laws in order to reduce the "temptations" of France to
unauthorized foreigners.  Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in
France range from 250,000 to 600,000, with suggestions that their number
increases by 30,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Sauvaigo commission's 46 recommendations include restricting the access
of illegal aliens to free health care and education, finger-printing visa
applicants from some countries, and holding suspected illegal immigrants for up
45 days to facilitate deportation--in many cases, police cannot identify and
thus deport aliens under the current 10 day detention limit.</tt><p>
<tt>The commission recommended that employers of illegal workers should be made
to pay for their repatriation, and called for creation of a computerized
register of anyone offering lodging or hospitality to foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>The 30 member commission made its recommendations on a 26-4 vote, with the
Socialist members dissenting.</tt><p>
<tt>The government was divided in its reactions to the report-- the French
minister for humanitarian assistance said it contained "unacceptable and
scandalous" ideas.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government announced that it had apprehended 2,000 illegal foreign
workers in 1995.  So far in 1996, police raided 114 illegal workshops in
Paris.</tt><p>
<tt>Some questioned the constitutionality of the recommendations.  The National
Front endorsed the recommendations, but said they did not go far enough--it
calls for the repatriation of 3 million immigrants to their countries of origin
and for the re-examination of 2.5 million naturalizations granted since 1974.
A recent poll found that 28 percent of the French supported the National Front,
up from 19 percent in January 1994.   </tt><p>
<tt>The United Nations Human Rights Commission criticized France on April 11
for the "wave of xenophobia and racism" sweeping the country, criticizing the
"Pasqua laws" enacted in 1993 that prevent the deportation of foreigners
married to French nationals, and the parents of children born in France, but do
not grant some of these foreigners work or residence visas.  The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights was signed in Paris in 1948.</tt><p>
<tt>The first week of April, Amnesty International issued a report that charged
French police with cruelty and ill-treatment of foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>A group of African immigrants were shuttled from a church to a gym to a
theater to avoid deportation from France--the police were asked to remove the
Africans from the church by Catholic Church authorities.  Some of the Africans
were deported to Mali; in one case, Malians attacked the police who accompanied
them after the plane landed.</tt><p>
<tt>France returned more than more than 10,000 foreigners to their countries of
origin in 1995.  A plane returning a drug trafficker to the Congo had to make
an emergency landing in Marseille after passengers attacked the policemen
accompanying the trafficker for not removing his handcuffs.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 21,170 applicants for political asylum in France in 1995, about 16
percent or 3,400 were accepted as refugees, including 16 of 2200 Algerian
applicants.  There were 26,000 asylum applications in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>France announced in March 1996 that it would remove border checks on
persons coming from Schengen partners Germany and Spain, but continue to check
persons coming from the Benelux until an agreement on drugs is reached with the
Netherlands.</tt><p>
<tt>France's population rose from 40 million to 58 million since World War II,
and 25 percent of the increase was due to immigration.  The immigrants included
1.5 million expatriates who returned to France from overseas colonies after
1956, including 650,000 from Algeria.</tt><p>
<tt>The percentage of foreigners in France has been about 6.5 percent since
1970, the level reached in 1931 after a wave of immigration by foreign workers
in the 1920s.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 24, the French government announced new measures to use computers
to control health care costs, another effort to rein in the rising costs of the
social welfare state.  Current French law permits individuals to choose their
doctors, with the government picking up most of the costs.  Efforts to reduce
pensions for government workers set off strikes.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Integration.</u> Roubaix, a city in northern France that is one third of
immigrant origin, was in the news because of a bombing outside police
headquarters that prompted a chase and shoot out that ended in Belgium. </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the immigrants first came to Roubaix to work in the textile
industry.  Over the past 30 years, the textile industry has disappeared, and
there are few jobs for second generation immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>City officials say it was a mistake to concentrate the immigrations in one
area, where extremism can take root .  In Alma-Gare, near the site of the gun
fight, most women are veiled and the adolescent boys often were Arafat-style
headgear.  Young people of North African background complain that they are not
"treated properly" by the French and not been given an equal chance--hence
their turn to fundamentalist Islam. </tt><p>
<tt>A government commission chaired by National Assembly member Henri Cuq
recommended that some high-rise apartment complexes that house immigrants be
destroyed because they are crime and health hazards.  About 150,000 immigrants,
most from north and west Africa, live in France's 710 high-rise hostels.  Most
are run by subsidized associations or state agencies.</tt><p>
<tt>The report said that 25 hostels, most in the Paris area, should be
destroyed within the next five years.  Others should be rehabilitated, with new
controls to keep out illegal residents.  Some hostels reportedly hold three
times as many residents as they should. </tt><p>
<tt>The hostels reportedly hamper integration because the immigrants are kept
isolated from French society.  Some managers of the hostels have given
authority to African elders, who run the hostels according to tribal rules.
</tt><p>
<tt><u>Overseas.</u>  On April 12, Prime Minister Alain Juppe said he would
increase efforts to prevent illegal immigration into French Guyana, France's
only South American possession.  Juppe said he planned to build a detention
center in St. Laurent, and to increase patrols on the nation's eastern border
with Brazil.  Illegal aliens, primarily from Brazil, Haiti and Surinam, make up
an estimated 25 percent of French Guyana's population of 150,000, and that
16,000 foreigners were expelled to Surinam.</tt><p>
<tt>St. Laurent was used by France from the mid-19th century until 1946 as the
center of its Devil's Island penal colony complex.  Unemployment in French
Guyana is 23 percent, and half of its economy is directly linked to a rocket
base in Ariane. </tt><p>

<tt>Greece plans to offer legal status to the 250,000 to 500,000 illegal
Albanians in the country, part of friendship agreement signed by the two
countries in March 1996.  Albania will allow the establishment of Greek schools

<tt>Greece accused Turkey of harboring "slave traders" on April 18, after a
Turkish boat allegedly dropped off eight illegal Iranian immigrants on a Greek
island--the Iranians had paid $1,000 to $4,000 each.  A Greek patrol boat fired
warning shots into the air; Turkey claimed that the incident took place in
Turkish waters, and that a fisherman was wounded. </tt><p>
<tt>The incident aggravated antagonism between Greece and Turkey regarding the
ownership of several small islands in the Aegean Sea.  A Greek government
spokesperson said that illegal immigration from Turkey to these islands was a
serious problem.  Between 1992 and 1995, Greece says that 22,906 illegal
immigrants entered Greece via Turkey, plus 9,590 so far in 1996.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC15">Ital</a>ian
Candidates Ignore Immigration Issue</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In the run-up to Italy's elections on April 21, the mainstream parties --
the center-right Freedom Alliance and center-left Olive Tree -- did not discuss
immigration, despite almost daily reports of ships attempting to smuggle aliens
into Italy catching fire or running aground.  Both major alliances argued that
debating immigration would only help the extreme right.</tt><p>
<tt>The leftist Olive Tree alliance won 169 of the 315 seats in the Italian
Senate, and 324 of 630 seats in the Lower House.   The Olive Tree publicly
supports migrant rights, arguing that Italy must become multi-racial and
multi-cultural society.  The National Alliance and the Northern League, on the
other hand, want to apprehend and expel illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Italy will come under increasing pressure from France and other EU nations
to control illegal immigration when it becomes a full member of the Schengen
agreement.  European Union members Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and non-members
Norway and Iceland, will become observers at Schengen meetings as of May
1.</tt><p>
<tt>Italy's has 922,706 legal migrants -- including 141,000 from EU nations,
and they are about 1.6 percent of the population.  The number of illegal
immigrants was dramatically cut in March 1996, from around 500,000 to about
200,000, after the immigration law was changed in November, 1995 to allow the
immediate deportation of illegal immigrants who break the law, and the rapid
expulsion of those who do not have the right papers.</tt><p>
<tt>Thousands of illegal immigrants reportedly went to police stations on March
31 in order to try to legalize their status before a new "immediate
deportation" law went into effect on April 1, 1996.  Illegal immigrants with
regular jobs but without legal status were allowed to regularize their status.

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">Vietnamese
Boat
People</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Over one million Vietnamese "boat people" have been resettled since 1975,
including 823,000 in the US, 137,000 each in Australia and Canada, 96,000 in
France, and 19,000 each in the UK and Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 20, a Malaysian navy ship transported 317 Vietnamese boat people
to Vietnam in the first of four forced repatriations by ship planned for the
next two months.  Once offloaded, the returnees are taken to reception centers
for screening before being returned to their home villages. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian navy will transport 1,765 Vietnamese over the next two
months.  The remaining 1,363 will be returned by air.  Malaysia offers
Vietnamese in camps an easy two hour flight home if they volunteer, or forcible
return on a boat.</tt><p>
<tt>Other Asian countries have avoided sending Vietnamese boat people back by
ship-- some critics have branded them prison ships.  The Malaysian government
has speeded up the return of Vietnamese boat people because it plans to shut
down its two remaining detention camps by June 30, when the UNHCR stops funding
them.</tt><p>
<tt>The Comprehensive Plan of Action for dealing with people leaving Vietnam by
boat was adopted in 1989.  Since then, some 80,000 boat people were recognized
as refugees and resettled elsewhere, 500,000 left Vietnam legally as immigrants
under the Orderly Departure Program, and 115,000 Vietnamese left their country
in boats, landed in nearby countries, and hoped to be selected to resettle in a
third country as refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the 115,000 were determined not to be refugees and were returned to
Vietnam, but 35,000 remained in camps in April 1996, including 19,200 in Hong
Kong, 4,800 in Thailand, 4,300 in Indonesia, and 3,700 in Malaysia.  The camps
have been closed to visitors so that they can be emptied by June 30,
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Local events sometimes make it difficult for the Vietnamese in the camps to
return to Vietnam quietly.  For example, the Philippines government announced
plans to close a camp holding 2,000 Vietnamese by June 30, 1996, but after
forcibly returning several Vietnamese, the government came under pressure from
the Catholic church not to force the Vietnamese into airplanes to send them
home.</tt><p>
<tt>In Hong Kong, Britain's Privy Council ruled that 15 Vietnamese should go
freed because Hanoi was unlikely to take them back--all were ethnic Chinese
with Taiwanese travel documents.  This raised hopes that other ethnic Chinese
could avoid a return to Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>The Privy Council's decision forced the Hong Kong legislature to table
discussion of the new Immigration Bill amendment, which would have given the
government the power to indefinitely and arbitrarily detain Vietnamese boat
people.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Vietnamese government says it can handle up to 3,600 returning
Vietnamese each month.  Each returning person is screened; Vietnam has refused
to take hundreds of the people back on the grounds that they are foreign
nationals or are ethnically not Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>In Vietnam, most reports are that two-thirds of returned boat people have
restarted their lives, with the help of cash grants of about $1,000 for a
family from the United Nations and European Union, and grants for the
communities they return to minimize local jealousy.

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC19">Chin</a>ese
Crackdown</a> on Migrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>China began a nationwide crackdown on illegal overseas workers on May 1.
Under new regulations, foreigners must obtain work permits from their local
labor department and residential permits from public security departments.
Foreign workers already living in China have until June 30 to secure the
necessary permits.  Foreign workers who fail to get the necessary permits could
be fined or deported. </tt><p>
<tt>The regulations will affect every one from diplomatic spouses to foreign
prostitutes, claims a Beijing labor official.  There are 170,000 foreigners
working in China-- 70,000 are employed by government organizations, and 100,000
by foreign institutions or overseas-funded ventures. </tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government also announced new regulations to regulate internal
migration for employment.  The Project of Orderly Trans-regional Migration of
Rural Laborers requires workers wishing to find work outside their home towns
to obtain a permit from the local authority, as well as a certificate from the
authorities in the destination--cities with high unemployment will be
off-limits to migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the new rules, migrants will not be allowed to look for work in major
cities already impacted by internal migrants.  The government plans to attempt
to induce workers to stay put by providing more jobs in government-subsidized
projects in underdeveloped areas.  The government hopes this new undertaking
will limit the number of migrants to about 30 million in 1996 and 40 million by
the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese Ministry of Labor estimates that 12.5 percent or 30 million of
China's rural workers are employed outside their places of origin.  Other
estimates place the number of internal migrants as high as 80 to 100
million.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese economists argue that the migrant labor force has been a boon to
the economy, but the large transient population is blamed for increased crime
and social instability-- 649,000 transients, registered as temporary residents
in urban areas, were apprehended for committing crimes in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>Observers say that China's migrant problem will likely worsen in the next
several years because nearly 130 million farmers in rural areas are now
redundant due to population increases and encroachment on farm land by
development projects. </tt><p>
<tt>Beijing opened a recruitment center for migrant workers in the West Railway
Station, the first step to regularize the flow of an estimated three million
migrant workers employed by some 2,900 enterprises and private businesses.
Central Beijing has about three million residents, and another eight million
people live in the metro area.</tt><p>
<tt>As the men go to the cities to find jobs, more Chinese women are left to
run the farms.  Researchers are finding that the status of women farmers is
increasing, along with their income.  In northern Shaanxi, one women began
helped local women farmers establish an apple industry.  The woman's family
income was $3,500, compared to the national average of $190.  Chinese farming
women still face discrimination in government programs developed for male heads
of households.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 1.2 billion people in China, and 45 percent are under 26.</tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government announced plans to move about 500,000 Chinese
workers into mining towns in Tibet.  Official Chinese figures place Tibet's
population at about 2.4 million, 90 percent ethnic Tibetans.  Unofficial data
suggest that the increasing number of Chinese traders and workers has pushed
the Chinese population to 150,000, with the urban population primarily Han
Chinese. </tt><p>
<tt>The influx of Han Chinese into Tibet is expected in increase ethnic
tensions because the Tibetans resent any incursion into their country by China.
The Chinese government responded that the purpose of the mining program that is
bringing Chinese to Tibet is to develop the economy, not encourage immigration.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Han Chinese in Tibet will be paid three to four times more than in
China because of a hardship allowance. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC20">Malaysia
Foreign Workers Are Security
Threat</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Malaysian government is calling foreign workers a national security
threat.  One Malaysian official said Malaysia needs to learn from the
experiences of Germany and France. </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian officials estimate that there are over one million foreign
workers in the country, about one-eight of their work force.  Most of the
foreign workers are from Indonesia and the Philippines, and they work on
plantations, construction sites and in factories.  About 500,000 are illegal.
</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia's new five-year plan, unveiled in mid-April, included a call for
the growth of capital-intensive and high-wage industries, including aerospace,
electronics, information technology, education services, and biotechnology, to
increase incomes and to curb labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian minister for human resources blames employer unwillingness to
provide housing for their workers as a reason immigrants are setting up illegal
settlements on government reserve land.  In the Malaysian state of Selangor,
there were about 343,000 foreign worker squatters.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1988, 23 settlements with sizable Indonesian populations were identified
in the Klang Valley.  In Kuala Lumpur, immigrants were found in 56 squatter
settlements in 1989.  Indonesians were seven percent of the capital's estimated
squatter population of over 180,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government is planning to raze all squatters' settlements on
government land.  The Malaysian government in April 1996 also began requiring
employers to provided housing for migrant workers to discourage squatting, and
announced that it is increasing the number of enforcement personnel responsible
for demolishing the squatters' settlements.</tt><p>
<tt>The Indonesian Embassy requested extra time before Indonesian camps are
razed so that the Indonesian foreign workers could find other housing.</tt><p>
<tt>One editorial in the New Straits Times said that, although the demolition
of squatter settlements is heart-wrenching, it must be done to protect the
county's law-abiding citizens.  The editorial also criticized the government
for giving ex-squatters preferential treatment to receive low cost
housing.</tt><p>
<tt>University of Malaya anthropologist Azizah Kassim says that Malaysia has
the largest foreign work force among Asean countries, with between 14 and 15
percent of the population foreign in 1995.  She estimates that there are over
half a million legal foreign workers, and between 500,000 and 700,000 illegal
foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government has been trying to register illegal foreign
workers through various amnesty programs, but the programs have not been very
successful.  One reason is that it costs an Indonesian worker in Malaysia about
RM460 ($185) to get a job through official channels, and only RM 70 through a
labor broker.  In addition, illegal workers are not tied to one job and
employer.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian officials assert that illegal settlements aggravate education,
housing and health problems. Azizah found that the ready availability of
foreign workers makes it hard for trade unions to increase wages and improve
conditions.  If Malaysia were to experience a recession, there could be mass
expulsions, as in the 1930s.  </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is a multi-ethnic society in which each group is worried about its
share of the population.  The influx of Indonesians is believed by some Chinese
to be tolerated by the Malaysian government, which allegedly sees Indonesians
as adding to Malay political power. </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is building a RM54.6 million ($22 million) wall 2.5 to 3.5 meters
high on its northern border with Thailand to discourage illegal immigration and
drug smuggling.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Japan
to Train Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Japanese government plans to extend the maximum length of "training"
for foreign workers from two to three years in order to encourage the
acceptance in the country of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The current program was last revised in April 1993.  Trainees are on
probation for six months, and then tested for skills.  If they pass the test,
they can continue working at a company for one and a half years. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign trainees was 1,164 in fiscal 1993, and 2,320 in the
first nine months of FY95.  Most trainees are from China.  Most of the workers
are trained at smaller companies such as machinery makers and construction.
</tt><p>
<tt>There are an increased number of meetings to discuss foreign worker issues
in Japan.  Some of the Japanese sponsors advocate at least a limited amnesty
for some illegal workers and the possibility of guest workers becoming
permanent residents.  One government report in 1995 estimated that there were
600,000 foreign workers, including 300,000 illegal workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan has announced a goal of having 100,000 foreign students by the year
2000, up from 54,000 in 1994, in order to combat shrinking enrollment due to
population declines.  However, only 3,000 foreigners took the standard entrance
exams required by all public and some private universities in 1995--the low
number is attributed to a crackdown since 1993 on illegal foreign workers in
Japan, the high cost of living, the Hanshin earthquake and the sarin gas
attacks.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Hong
Kong</a>/a></a>
Prepares Residents for 1997</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Some 160,000 Hong Kong residents lined up before the March 31, 1996
deadline to apply for British National Overseas (BNO) passports that give them
more freedom to travel internationally after July 1, 1997.  BNO passports
permit visa-free travel for holders to the UK and 80 other countries, while the
SAR passports to be issued to Hong Kong residents by China currently permit
visa-free travel only to the UK and Singapore.</tt><p>
<tt>About half of Hong Kong's 6.2 million residents are eligible for BNO
passports.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated one million Hong Kong residents hold foreign passports,
raising the issue of how China, which does not permit dual citizenship, will
treat them.  One proposal is to permit those with foreign passports to declare
themselves to be foreigners or Chinese when they enter Hong Kong--if they
declare themselves foreigners, they will enjoy consular protection from their
country of nationality in Hong Kong,  but may lose some of the rights that
Chinese have in Hong Kong.  </tt><p>
<tt>A variation on this proposal is to allow current Hong Kong residents who
declare themselves to be foreigners to nonetheless be able to live and work in
Hong Kong without visas.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hong Kong government is drafting a list of people of ethnic minority
who may be left stateless after the handover.  The list is expected to be
released in the next two weeks.  The list will contain up to about 60,000 names
of those who do not hold three-star permanent Hong Kong identity cards and
whose only travel document is either a British Dependent Territory's Citizen
passport or a British National Overseas passport.  Most of the ethnic
minorities are from India and Pakistan.  </tt><p>
<tt>During a March visit, British Prime Minister John Major promised sanctuary
for ethnic minorities if they came under pressure from China to leave Hong
Kong. </tt><p>
<tt>The Hong Kong government announced new rules for mainland Chinese migrants
to get permanent residency in Hong Kong on April 25.  Effective April 24,
holders of one-way permits will be allowed to stay for seven years on arrival,
and then become eligible for residency.  Previously, migrants from China would
have had to receive four extensions. </tt><p>
<tt>The change will allow 52 immigrations officers to be reassigned, and reduce
government processing fees by $6 million.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Taiwan:
Foreign Workers and Illegal
Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On April 10, some 550 Chinese illegal immigrants in Taiwan staged a
demonstration at a detention center after being held as long as seven months.
The Chinese were caught in fishing boats before they entered Taiwan; they were
migrating in search of jobs.  They are demanding to be returned to China, but
the Chinese government has refused to take them back. </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwanese government agencies will allow Hong Kong labor brokers to help
find jobs in Taiwan for specialists and technicians from the British colony.
Only legally registered labor agencies in Hong Kong will be allowed to open
Taiwan offices.  The brokers will be prohibited from sending unskilled workers
such as maids to Taiwan. </tt><p>
<tt>Officials of the Council of Labor Affairs and labor representatives reached
an agreement that will prevent Taiwan companies from employing foreign workers
for longer than six or eight years.  The CLA wants to cut down on the country's
reliance on overseas workers, and to allocate the foreign worker quotas to
companies that have the most acute need for foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The CLA wants to lower the ratio of foreign to native workers, since the
unemployment rate in Taiwan is at a relatively high rate of two percent.
However, agreement could not be reached on a CLA proposal to cut the ratio of
foreign workers to 30 percent of the total work force in the manufacturing
sector from the current level of 35 percent, reducing the ratio for major
public construction projects to 50 percent from 65 percent, and lowering the
ratio for large investment projects exceeding NT$ 200 million to 40 percent
from 50 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan currently has over 210,000 legal foreign workers.  There were about
160,000 foreigners in Taiwan in 1994, including 125,000 blue-collar
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Although the unemployment rate has lead to restrictions on foreign workers
in some areas, they are credited for the success of the Taichung industrial
processing zone.  In 1993, 77 foreign workers were hired, and their number rose
to 528 in 1994.  In 1995, over 900 foreign workers were employed, and there
were still over 400 job vacancies in the zone.  Foreigners account for 10

Remittances Up</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Philippine Central Bank reported that remittances from Filipino
overseas contract workers increased over 63 percent to US $4.93 billion in 1995
(124 billion pesos), up from US $3.01 billion in 1994.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The number of Filipinos going abroad fell from 719,602 in 1994 to
654,022 in 1995.  Filipino workers in Singapore remitted a record or US $106
million in 1995.  Most of the 65,000 Filipinos in Singapore are female domestic
helpers, and they remit an average $1630.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines is the only country with a law that explicitly tries to
protect its nationals employed abroad--the Migrant Workers and Overseas
Filipino Act of 1995.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Several Filipino politicians have that the country's Overseas
Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) be merged into a new Cabinet level department to deal
with Filipinos working abroad.  Other proposals include the creation of an
Overseas Filipino Workers bank, with a capital contributions from the
Philippine Social Security System (SSS) and Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS).</tt><p>
<tt>On April 18, a Philippine congressional committee, the Committee on
Overseas Contract Workers, reported in mid-April that Singapore, Malaysia,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey do not have laws to protect
foreign workers.  There are 500,000 Filipino workers in these seven countries,
employed mostly as maids, and Singapore, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt do not have
laws to protect foreigner maids.  In Malaysia, labor laws apply equally to
foreign and local workers, but the foreign workers must pay levies for the
privilege of working in the country.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC26">New

Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The New Zealand First Party is gaining strength in opinion polls, mostly by
portraying the 125,000 Asian immigrants in the country of 3.5 million as "too
rich" and persons who "sponge" off the local economy by leaving their families
in New Zealand, while they commute to jobs in Taiwan.  Asians are about 60
percent of New Zealand's immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The First Party, headed by a Maori, calls for a limit of 10,000 immigrants
per year and a four-year probation period for all immigrants during which they
could own a maximum 25 percent of any New Zealand company.  The First Party's
campaign has been blamed for three attacks on Asian immigrant families in the
past few months.</tt><p>
<tt>In response to the increasing anti-immigrant sentiment, a group of mostly
Asians launched a new political party of April 22.  The Ethnic Minority Party
of New Zealand hopes to give a political voice to ethnic minorities.  Asians
account for 3.5 percent of New Zealand's population.  The new party plans to
form a coalition with other small parties to reach the five percent threshold
needed to gain representation in the Parliament. </tt><p>
<tt>Some see the creation of a racially based party as detrimental to race
relations in New Zealand.  </tt><p>
<tt>Australian Immigration Minister Paul Ruddock announced plans in March 1996
to encourage new immigrants to bypass Sydney and Melbourne for South Australia,
Tasmania and the Northern Territory.  Some 80,000 immigrants are expected in
1996, mostly from Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, the Philippines and India.</tt><p>
<tt>Voters in New South Wales and  Queensland re-elected two candidates who
want to eliminate special preference for Aborigines.  Their re-election
reflects a growing sentiment, especially among the poorer whites, that the
Aborigines, who have received protections from the government, are on the
"gravy train."</tt><p>
<tt>The new coalition plans to also review the present immigration policy, with
a proposal to cut welfare to new immigrants who are unemployed. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC27">Foreigners
in the
Gulf</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) States--Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates-- are attempting to reduce
their dependence on foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are over seven million foreigners among the GCC's 10 million workers,
and foreigners make up 90 per cent of the work force in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), 83 per cent in Qatar, 82 per cent in Kuwait, 69 per cent in
Saudi Arabia and around 60 per cent in Bahrain and Oman.  The total GCC
population of 26 million is expected to increase to 39 million by 2010,
including 21 million residents under 21.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1995, GCC labor ministers adopted a "blueprint on facilitating
the movement of national manpower between member states and the replacement of
foreign labour by national manpower."  However, plans to train local workers,
promote free mobility for GCC nationals within the region, and reduce
dependence on foreign workers, in part by reducing their wages and benefits,
have been slow to develop.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia has about 7.5 million workers, including 5.5 million
foreigners (73 percent of the labor force are foreigners).  Oman has 900,000
workers, including 620,000 or 69 percent foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait has 718,848 workers, including 605,889 or 84 percent foreigners.
Bahrain has 226,448 workers, including 135,786 or 60 percent foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Bahrain, an island nation linked by causeway to Saudi Arabia, has a
population of 572,000, divided about equally between Bahrain nationals and
foreigners.  The per capita income was $14,600 per year in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Bahrain nationals make up 90 percent of government workers and 30 percent
of private-sector workers.  However, from two to 11 percent of Bahrain
nationals are unemployed.</tt><p>
<tt>The government is attempting to urge Bahrain nationals to accept
lower-level jobs now held by foreigners.  Bahrain nationals now constitute 25
percent of employees in four- and five-star hotels, compared with five percent
in the early 1980s</tt><p>
<tt>Sunni Muslims control the government and most of the island's wealth, and
the Shiite Muslim majority.</tt><p>
<tt>The UAE has 2.4 million people, and 90 percent of its 800,000 workers are
foreigners.  Males outnumber females in the UAE two to one.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, the UAE announced that foreigners could bring spouses,
sons up to 18, and unmarried daughters or sons in school if they earned at
least 3,000 dirhams ($817) each month and were provided with free housing (4000
dirhams without free housing).</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2.6 million people who say they were hurt by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990 have filed claims for compensation, asking for $190 billion, and
30 percent of Iraq's revenues from the sale of oil would be diverted to pay
their claims, a projected $1.2 billion per year.</tt><p>
