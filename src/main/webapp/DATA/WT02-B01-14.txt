<h2>What This Document Is </h2>

<p>In August, 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration held a
special conference to try to deal with the fact that they were
getting beaten -- badly -- every time they tried to come out for
a drug policy debate. In the last few years, they have been
beaten in these debates so often that it is really an
embarrasment to the whole drug warrior crew. They don't have a
single argument which stands up to close scrutiny. </p>

<p>The reason they were getting beaten is because people began
using the Persuasive Strategies and they got better educated on
the issue. As a result of the Persuasive Strategies being used by
large numbers of people across the US, they were getting publicly
hammered every time they came out for a debate. It was really an
embarrassing trend, so they had to try to do something about it. </p>

<p>Now they have laid out, in detail, their ten biggest arguments
on the issues raised in the debate. These arguments will now be
laid to rest. </p>

<p>Because their book was in large part a response to my
Persuasive Strategies, I have undertaken to write a reply to
their book. In short, they still don't have a single argument
which stands up to close scrutiny. The debate is over and it is
time for them to admit it. </p>
