Mobility is a characteristic of American life.  We love our cars.  We "go away" to college.   We change homes and careers several times in our lives.  However, it is income and class mobility that truly differentiates the American way of life from the rest of the globe.  America was settled by people from all lands who sought a "better life" for their subsequent generations relative to the life that was possible in the "old country."  Our parents ingrained in us that we could "do better."
<P>
Official U.S. Treasury data* illustrate the income mobility of Americans.  A recent study divided households into five groups (quintiles).  One conclusion from the study: In the three lowest quintiles, one-third or fewer of the taxpayers in the quintile at the beginning of the sample period were in the same quintile at the end of the sample period just nine years later. Two out of three taxpayers had improved their earnings sufficiently to move out of the bottom earning quintile.
<P>
Income mobility can be dramatic.  More taxpayers in the bottom quintile moved to the top quintile over the nine-year period than stayed in the bottom quintile. Only 14 percent of households in the lowest quintile at the start of this study remained in the lowest quintile 9 years later at the end of the study.  One quarter (25 percent) entered the middle class (the third percentile). That's in just nine years!  Think about the mobility between generations!  

<P>

What's the explanation for this mobility?  Education and freedom, two aspects of American life that we take for granted, are really quite unique in the world and are key to mobility.  Rigid social societies, such as Mexico or Iran, have seen violent revolutions as a consequence of angry people who felt trapped in their position. In the United States, access to high school education and the many levels of college education offer people of all ages the opportunity to gather skills necessary for a better job (i.e., income mobility).  

<P>

Freedom allows people, once they have skills, to apply anywhere they want for a job that uses their skills.  In some countries, individuals can make money but still not move out of their class. This is true of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs in southeast Asia and Africa.  In the U.S., where people can relocate, change jobs within a career and change careers, labor mobility reduces the average cost of labor and the average level of unemployment.

<P>

Education and freedom are unique to the American experience because it is so 
accessible to everyone -- especially because it has the ability to make the greatest impact on those in the lowest quintile.

<P>

My own career is an example of this.  My father never went to high school, my mother graduated from high school but never thought of college. But because I had the advantage of my parents' savings, a scholarship and federal loans, I was able to go to college and beyond that to get my doctorate in economics. Then I exercised my freedom to make a choice by applying for and getting a faculty position at Indiana University.  Then I was free again to move to Chicago and work at Kemper. 

<P>

With Kemper, shareholders are attempting to provide mutual funds to provide for the American dream of income mobility for their children.  It's our job -- and one we take seriously -- to help them realize that dream.
