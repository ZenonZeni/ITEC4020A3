Japan's tire demand to hit 2nd highest in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's domestic demand for motor vehicle tires for this year
is expected to rise 8.5% from last year to 1,027,000 tons, the
second highest level on record following the 1.03 million tons
posted in 1990, an industry association said Monday.
     The Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association said demand
for new tires will reach 210,000 tons, up 0.7%, while that for
replacement tires will increase 8.2% to 403,000 tons.
     Demand for tires for export will rise 13.3% to 414,000 tons,
the association said.
     Akira Suzuki, managing director of the association, said,
''Total tire output for this year is certain to hit a record high
given production plans of domestic tire makers for November and
December.''
     The steady growth stems largely from brisk exports to Southeast
Asia and Europe, and strong demand for replacement tires,
particularly those for trucks, association officials said.
     Domestic demand for tires next year will fall 1.7% from this
year to 1.01 million tons, the association said.

Japan's Nov. vehicle output falls 9.1%++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's motor vehicle output in November fell 9.1% to 863,460
for the sixth straight month of declines from year-earlier levels,
an industry association reported Monday.
     The figure brought the number of vehicles produced in the 11
months to November to 9,423,306, down 2.8% from a year earlier, the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
     Domestic sales of motor vehicles in November rose 4.6% to
593,073, while exports are estimated to have fallen 21%, it said.
     Passenger car output in November came to 655,067 vehicles, down
5.7% from a year earlier for the sixth straight month of decrease.
     Output of trucks fell 18.9% to 204,047, also marking the
sixth consecutive decline.
     Production of buses, however, rose 8.1% to 4,346 for the first
rise in seven months, the association said.
     Of passenger car production, automobiles with engine capacity
of over 2 liters accounted for 218,532, down 7.8%, and smaller cars
fell by the same margin to 354,714, it said.
     In contrast, output of minicars with engine capacity of less
than 660 cc jumped 12.3% to 81,821, it said.
     Sales of passenger cars in the domestic market in November rose
7.0% to 380,405, with sales of trucks up 0.8% to 211,784.
     Motorcycle production in November fell 9.0% from the same month
last year to 210,451, after rising 1.5% in October.
     The association said cumulative production of motorcycles in the
first 11 months of this year grew 2.0% over the same period
last year to 2,540,235.
     The association said sales for the whole of 1995 are estimated
to reach 2.74 million units, up about 0.5% over the previous year
and the first rise in three years.
     It said brisk sales of bikes with 50 cc engines were a major
factor for the gain.
     The association said production of 50-cc bikes for the
January-November period soared 10.3% over a year earlier to 886,077
units.

Toyota Motor to promote younger managers on merit basis+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. will start promoting
younger workers to managerial posts, in a personnel shakeup from
Jan. 1, on the basis of merit rather than seniority, company
officials said Monday.
     The officials, however, said only a few younger personnel were
appointed as department chiefs or deputy department chiefs this time,
since it was the first round of promotion reform.
     The company also unveiled a sweeping reorganization program
involving both domestic and overseas operations.
     Emphasis will be put on consolidation and realignment of
administrative and production departments in North America, where
local vehicle production is expected to increase, the officials said.

Kantor welcomes progress in Japan's auto market opening+

WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Thursday he
welcomes progress in Japan's market-opening and expansion of
Japanese automobile transplants in the six months since an
automotive trade accord with Japan was concluded.
     ''I am pleased with the progress made to date, particularly in
the areas of deregulation of the Japanese after-market and the
increased investment in Japanese auto transplant operations,'' he
said in a statement.
     The accord reached in Geneva between Kantor and Japanese trade
minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in June averted the imposition of 5.6
billion dollars in sanctions on Japanese luxury car imports.
     ''The progress in these areas translates into real benefits for
American workers and American companies,'' the statement said.
     ''We will continue to vigorously monitor implementation of the
agreement to ensure strict compliance,'' Kantor said, noting that
U.S. exports of autos and auto parts for the third quarter of 1995
have increased by 31% over the same period of last year.

Toyota tops TSE list of aggregated stock value+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Toyota Motor Corp. topped the 1995 rankings for high stock
value released by the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday.
     The list showed the closing price of Toyota stock at the end of
1995 trading Friday standing at 2,190 yen per share for an aggregated
value of 8,191.7 billion yen.
     Japan's leading automaker was followed by three financial
institutions, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and
Sumitomo Bank for second, third and fourth places.
     Domestic telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. ranked eighth and Nomura Securities Co. placed 10th.
     The exchange also said an average 357.02 million shares were
traded daily in 1995, up 8.6% over the previous year's 328.47
million shares.
     The value of daily trading, however, was down 5.5% at 315.7
billion yen, it said.
     The exchange said the trading value fell below 300 billion yen
from March to June but then turned upward in July on active buying by
foreign investors.
     In December, it said, the value of daily trading hit the year's
high of 471 billion yen.

5-year airport buildup program to begin in FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government on Monday endorsed the Transport Ministry's
five-year airport consolidation program which will entail total
investment of 3.6 trillion yen, starting in fiscal 1996, ministry
officials said.
     They said the budgetary appropriations were incorporated in a
draft budget for fiscal 1996.
     A total of 141.4 billion yen will be disbursed as public works
expenditures related to airport consolidation in the initial year, up
7.3% over the current year, they said.
     In addition, they said 563 billion yen will be earmarked for the
program from a special account for the airport consolidation program,
up 2.7% over the current year.
     The initial-year outlays will include 76.3 billion yen for the
expansion of New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, east of
Tokyo.
     An appropriation of 191.6 billion yen will be earmarked for the
construction of new runways at Haneda International Airport in
Tokyo, the officials said.
     The new fiscal budget also will include 30.5 billion yen for the
consolidation of two existing superexpress railways in northern Japan
and construction of a new superexpress line in the southern main
island of Kyushu, they said.
     The government will provide 4.8 billion yen for the
technological development of a linear motor railway and 14.7 billion
yen for construction of local railways, the officials said.

Snow, strong winds grip Hokkaido, air traffic disrupted+

SAPPORO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Snow and strong winds hit the main northern island of Hokkaido
on Monday, wreaking havoc with transportation systems as flights
into and out of New Chitose Airport and train runs were canceled.
     Ninety-nine schools in Hokkaido were also forced to close as a
Siberian cold wave gripped northern Japan and buffeted much of the
Japanese archipelago.
     A typhoon-strength low-pressure system centered in the Pacific
Ocean off Hokkaido disrupted transportation systems, causing 47
flights into and out of New Chitose Airport to be canceled along with
train runs.
     Chitose airport, the gateway to Hokkaido, had been
intermittently closed since Sunday evening.
     An estimated 43,000 passengers on the Japan Railways and other
railway systems in northern Japan were also stranded by the weather
when 117 train runs, including eight JR express train runs, were
canceled, railway officials said.
     One person was missing after a fishing boat was overturned in a
weather-related accident in the mouth of a river near Oga, Akita
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast, police said.
     According to the Sapporo meteorological observatory, the low
pressure system east of Hokkaido is expected to bring heavy snow to
the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk region through Tuesday.
     During 24 hours by 3 p.m. Monday, 32 centimeters of snow had
fallen in Kushiro, while 23 cm were recorded in Tomakomai.  The 10
cm falling in Sapporo added to the 74-cm accumulation there, 53
cm more than the average.
     In western Japan, accidents caused by the rough weather were
also reported.  In Kyoto Prefecture, a 57-year-old man died when his
tractor hit a support post in his storehouse, causing the
snow-covered tin roof to collapse on him, police said.
     In neighboring Shiga Prefecture, a 52-year-old woman was found
dead in a stream near her home.  She is believed to have slipped on
the snow-covered road and fallen into the stream, police said.
     Road, train and air traffic systems were also affected by the
weather.
     The Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for heavy snow,
strong winds and high waves across wide areas ranging from northern
to western Japan.
     In some mountainous areas, snow of up to 80 cm is expected to
fall by Tuesday morning.

Air India plane makes emergency landing at Karachi+

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     A Dubai-bound Air India jetliner with 179 people aboard made an
emergency landing at Karachi airport Thursday after a hoax telephone
call that a bomb had been planted on the plane, Pakistani Television
Corp. (PTV) reported.
     PTV said the flight had originated in New Delhi and was in
midair when it was diverted to Karachi, following a call received by
Indian aviation authorities that a bomb was aboard.
     No bomb was found but the plane could not leave due to several
technical problems, PTV said.
     The passengers were accommodated in Karachi and being sent to
Dubai on different flights, it said.

More ship export contracts being made in yen+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     More yen-denominated export contracts for Japanese ships are
being made reflecting views in the industry that the yen is unlikely
to rise in the near future, a spokesman at the Japan Ship Exporters
Association said Monday.
     ''A lot of people apparently expect the yen to stay around
current levels against the dollar for the time being,'' the spokesman
said.
     He said the ratio of yen-based export contracts to all
contracts on a ton basis dropped to 20.8% in April and 14.5% in May,
but has increased over the months, standing at 52.4% in October and
53.3% in November.
     ''The share is likely to stay above 50% in December,'' he said,
noting that shipping companies are now willing to pay in yen because
record low interest rates in Japan make it attractive to procure
funds in the Japanese currency.
     During the dollar's drop which continued until last summer,
shipowners had asked to pay export contracts for ships in dollars,
fearing that payment in yen would prove costly should the yen rise
further against the dollar.

Kobe Port wins British award for postquake recovery+

KOBE, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The specialist British trade magazine Containerization
International says in its December edition it has chosen the
quake-ravaged port of Kobe in western Japan for its ''Company of the
Year'' award for 1995, port officials said Thursday.
     The magazine, which is distributed in some 120 countries, chose
the port over more than a dozen other companies and organizations
around the world for the rapid manner in which it is recovering from
the destructive impact of the Jan. 17 Great Hanshin Earthquake.
     The quake rendered much of the port of Kobe inoperable, and left
some 6,300 dead in the city and its environs.
     An official at Kobe's Port authority said he considers the award
the result of a concerted effort by the city's administration and the
private sector.
     ''We'd like to see the prize as an incentive toward recovery,''
he said.

Seibu Railway suffers 5.1 bil. yen forex loss+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Seibu Railway Co. has suffered a 5.1 billion yen foreign
exchange loss through helping a U.S. subsidiary but the loss will
not affect its fiscal 1995 earnings, a company official said
Thursday.
     The loss emerged after the railway operator bought preferred
shares issued by its Hawaiian subsidiary as part of its capital
increase, using 84 million dollars Seibu lent to it producing a
foreign exchange loss of 2.85 billion yen, Masao Horiguchi, managing
director of Seibu, told a news conference.
     Horiguchi said the replacement of the loans with preferred
shares is to reduce the burden of interest payments by Aina Kamalii
Corp. and thus to improve its earnings standing.
     Aina Kamalii runs hotels and golf courses in Hawaii.
     Seibu Railway has no plans to revise its earnings projection for
the current fiscal year ending March 31, announced Nov. 24, because
the loss had already been factored in, he said.
     According to the projection, Seibu Railway's unconsolidated
pretax profit will reach 500 million yen on operating revenues of 229
billion yen.  Net profits are expected to hit 2.3 billion yen.
     By the end of next March, the company will replace another 76
million dollars worth of the loan with preferred shares to be issued
by Aina Kamalii, producing a foreign exchange loss of some 2.3
billion yen, but this loss, too, has been discounted, Horiguchi said.
     The rest of Seibu Railway's loans to Aina Kamalii, totaling 560
million dollars, will be replaced with preferred shares in the next
fiscal year, he said.
     This is likely to incur a foreign exchange loss of some 4
billion yen, which the company is considering offsetting by selling
land, he said.
