CANADA SIGNS AGREEMENT TO PRIVATIZE AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES

     Canada's air traffic control system will be run on a privatized,
not-for-profit basis beginning April 1 under an agreement in principle
signed by Canada and Nav Canada, the government air traffic control
agency, late last month. 
     The transaction, which will cost Nav Canada C$1.5 billion, is
part of the government's on-going privatization effort. The agreement
is subject to approval by Canada's parliament.
     Some 6,400 federal employees will be transferred to Nav Canada,
which will maintain the same pay, benefits, working conditions and
seniority as under the government. 
     Nav Canada will establish internal safety procedures, while
Transport Canada, the country's safety board, will establish
regulations for the privatized Nav Canada and will monitor its
operations to ensure compliance. 
     The company will also assume various obligations, including
restructuring costs associated with the transfer of authority, all
costs related to the completion of existing capital projects and costs
associated with implementing efficiencies in the operation and
management of air navigation systems.
     Nav Canada will derive its revenue from a transitional period
payment agreement, overflight fees implemented last month, and oceanic
fees for services provided by the company over the North Atlantic. The
last is provided for under terms of an international agreement.

USAIR TAKES ON VALUJET AT WASHINGTON DULLES

     USAir began late last month adding new service and departures
from Washington Dulles International Airport in a move that challenges
ValuJet Airlines and United Airlines in several East Coast city-pairs.
     USAir has added flights from Dulles to Boston, Columbus, Ohio,
and Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach -- most of which are ValuJet
city pairs. "We are increasing our daily departures from Dulles
airport by approximately 33 percent, adding nearly 41 percent more
seat capacity," says     Robert Fornaro, USAir senior vice president
of planning. Until this announcement, ValuJet was the only carrier to
fly the Dulles-West Palm Beach route.
     In January, USAir will begin Dulles-Tampa service and, in
February, increase Dulles-Boston service. ValuJet has had Washington
Dulles as a focus city and recently named Boston and Orlando its new
focus cities. By February, USAir says it and USAir Express will
operate 34 daily flights from Dulles, 164 flights from Washington
National Airport and 195 flights from Baltimore-Washington
International Airport.

MIDWEST EXPRESS CONTINUES EXPANSION

     Milwaukee, Wis.-based Midwest Express acquired two McDonnell
Douglas DC-9-32 aircraft previously operated by Garuda Indonesia. The
aircraft are being acquired through Australian Aircraft Sales of
Sydney, Australia. The aircraft are low-cycle models manufactured in
1979.
     The aircraft acquisition "is part of our ongoing strategy of
controlled and profitable growth," says Tim Hoeksema, president of the
airline, which recently split from its parent company, Kimberly-Clark
Corp. so it could be free to grow and become a public firm.
     The aircraft were added to Midwest Express' fleet last month and
will enter revenue service in April and May 1996. The aircraft also
will be hush-kitted to comply with Stage III noise requirements.
     The new planes give Midwest Express's  fleet of 21 aircraft, 19
of which are DC-9s. Service between Milwaukee and Boston, Dallas/Fort
Worth and Philadelphia will be expanded using one of the new
airframes, while the second will go to the airline's charter business.
     Midwest Express now serves 22 major business destinations
throughout the U.S. and Canada.

AIR SOUTH TO START BUSINESS-CLASS SECTION; EXPANDS TO FLORIDA

     South Carolina-based start-up Air South will implement a
business-class `club' section in its aircraft, looking for an upgraded
fare in a low-cost market. The airline also will start new service to
several southern U.S. destinations, mostly in Florida.
     Air South Chief Financial Officer Tom Volz says the carrier will
charge $20 extra for an "up-front club section" seat and, at the same
time, will eliminate "lounge areas" it has had on its six Boeing 737s-
200s.



Air South
Start-up Funding
($ millions)

S.C. Grants*      $3.0
Grant-training*   $1.1
Guaranteed debt  $12.0
Equity            $3.5
**********************
Total            $19.6

* Training and grants came from the city of Columbia, S.C., 
and Lexington and Richland Counties.



     The airline has lowered costs from 14 cents per seat mile when it
first flew last year to about 8 cents. It costs Air South 8.3 cents
per seat mile to fly a 250-mile segment, Volz says.
     The airline is expanding southward, mostly to the new focus area
of both Southwest Airlines and ValuJet Airlines: Florida. Air South
will soon start non-stop service from South Carolina to Atlanta,
Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville and Myrtle Beach. New one-stops are
planned to Miami, Tallahassee and Tampa-St. Petersburg. 
     Air South executes a "hub-bypass strategy," says Volz, where the
airline, for example, bypasses its Atlanta hub. The airline also will
go ticketless early in 1996 and expand into larger markets, including
Chicago, Florida, New York and Washington.
     "We have to be at least 11 units [aircraft] to realize advantages
of scale," says Volz, pointing to the carrier's need for five more
737s.
     Volz also says Air South, which received substantial assistance
from the state of South Carolina, has put $12 million back into the
state's economy in 1995.

AIRTRAN AIRWAYS ACQUIRES TENTH 737-200

     Orlando-based AirTran Airways has signed a letter of intent to
lease a tenth Boeing 737-200 from Interlease Aviation. The airline
will use the airplane to inaugurate new service from Orlando to
Akron/Canton, Ohio, Allentown, Pa., and Rochester, N.Y., on Feb. 1.
     With the new service AirTran Airways will serve 20 U.S. points.
"As we obtain additional aircraft," says President John Horn, "we plan
to continue to expand our low-fare route system from Orlando."
     The tenth airplane will be configured to 126 seats and powered by
Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 powerplants, which also will be hushkitted.
AirTran has not yet taken delivery of its eighth and ninth aircraft.

EL PASO FEE HIKES CAUSE SOUTHWEST TO INCREASE LONG-HAUL FLYING...

     A decision by El Paso, Texas, airport officials to quadruple
landing fees is having the unintended consequence of creating new
headaches for airlines competing against Southwest Airlines.
     Southwest said last month it will eliminate some services that
have connected through El Paso from origin points such as Houston and
San Antonio and create new non-stop services to the west coast.
     The new Houston-Las Vegas and San Antonio-Los Angeles services
represent a competitive threat to Continental Airlines, which operates
Houston-Las Vegas service from Intercontinental Airport. Southwest's
service will originate from Houston Hobby Airport. Continental
operates a competitive non-stop, point-to-point service between San
Antonio and Los Angeles, a Continental spokesman says.
     Bill Owen, a schedule planner for Southwest, says, "It simply was
no longer feasible for us to fly those flights through El Paso," he
says. "Our San Antonio-LAX service had always been a one-stop through
El Paso."
     Southwest now has the greatest number of departures from Las
Vegas, and Owen says it will begin a small additional service next
year. "It's just a bottomless pit for making money there," he says.
"It really is a rapidly growing city."

  ...WHILE LAX RAISES EYEBROWS BY DROPPING PFCs

     Los Angeles International Airport has decided to stop collecting
a $3 passenger facility charge beginning Jan. 1, becoming the first
airport to voluntarily discontinue the charge. The move surprised some
industry observers, but appears to be an isolated event, since the
airport is holding open the option of applying for future PFC funding.
     "Nearly 54 million southern Californians and others traveling
from LAX will save approximately $60 million annually with the
passenger facility charge removed from their tickets," says John
Driscoll, executive director of the Los Angeles Department of
Airports. "LAX is the first airport in the nation to discontinue
collecting PFCs," he emphasized.
     The airport has stopped collecting the fee, says deputy executive
director Jerald Lee, because it has collected $158 million and it is
running out of time to spend the money. For instance, the FAA's
deadline for using funds collected for a proposed people mover system
run out next spring, but the airport is reconsidering the program
altogether. Instead, the airport is trying to redirect the funds to a
terminal project at Ontario Airport, which is under review by airlines
and the FAA. 
     LAX likely will pursue PFC collections in the future since it is
considering some $2 billion in renovations. "I don't think that there's
any question that we will" reapply for PFC collection, says Lee.
     Some industry observers see other motives in LAX's action. Peter
Bianchini, an analyst for Standard & Poor's, says LAX's decision "is a
continued step in [the] direction to separate LAX from [revenue
diversion regulations of] the federal government." He explains that
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has supported diversion of airport
revenue into city coffers to be used for non-airport projects,
something that is currently disallowed under federal laws governing
PFCs. So LAX will simply stop collecting the PFCs, Bianchini suggests,
to avoid the associated federal regulations.

THE AVRO RJ - PART V

(Editor's Note: This is the next of a series reviewing the BAe 146 and
its derivative, the Avro RJ. Paul Leighton, editor of sister-
publication Aircraft Value News, reviews the customer list of the 146
and RJ family.)
     The 1995 list prices of the Avro range are, according to Avro,
$20.6 million for the RJ70, $25 million for the RJ85, $28.4 million
for the RJ100 and $29.7 million for the yet-to-be-ordered RJ115. 
   In some cases, the manufacturer may actually receive such amounts
if the customer relies on BAe to provide finance. But for most
customers, the competition between regional jet manufacturers is such
that transaction prices are probably much lower. To date, there have
been few small orders. Those buyers ordering more than two likely
secured a reasonable discount. 
     Crossair, for example, is unlikely to have paid anything like
$28.4 million each for the 10 RJ100s it ordered. Similarly, the 23
orders placed by Sabena probably received a discount of at least 20%.
Avro tends to provide realistic quotes of order value. For example,
Avianca placed a further order for a single RJ100 example that Avro
quoted as being worth $25 million.
     The competition is intense among regional aircraft manufacturers,
with the U.S. dollar's depreciation particularly crippling for non-
U.S. manufacturers at present. Fokker has in the past been forced to
sell aircraft at less than cost. Both Fokker and BAe have made it
clear that they intend to reduce costs in the coming years. BAe has
moved production of the RJ wings from Avro in the U.S. back to BAe in
the UK to better manage its costs and reduce the sum of dollar-based
components. But the burden of further cost-reduction can be expected to
fall on suppliers, given that BAe has already undertaken considerable
cuts. It would appear that, if the price of new aircraft remains stable
or even falls, used values will decline. 
     The RJ has been in service for less than two years and all RJs
remain with the original customers, although Avro has leased out some
for short periods. There has thus been no market indication of used RJ
values. With deliveries just starting in quantity and in view of the
quality of most customers, few if any RJs are likely to be available
soon. 
     The problems of Business Express, which operates three RJ70s,
suggest that, in the event no further deliveries are made, the existing
RJ fleet will have to be eliminated. Avro will work hard to ensure that
the balance of nine units is delivered within a reasonable time and that
the three already in service remain so for the next few years. Failure
to do so would raise the possibility that the RJ will be viewed in the
same way as its predecessor.
(Next week: BAe 146 and Avro RJ values)
