 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>CHRISTMAS A TIME FOR REAFFIRMING FAMILY VALUES</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>By-Barbara Ayash - International Woman of the Year</H2>

<H4>

<DD>This holiday season, a youngster somewhere will lie dying in a pool of blood, the happless victim of a gun shot. His killer will be one of the estimated 135,000 armed teen-agers who now walk the streets in this country. 

This month, while we are preparing to celebrate the hope of peace and goodwill to our fellow man, thousands of robberies will take place on or near school grounds. And a number of children will attempt to commit suicide, as one in seven children now do, sooner or later. 

This Christmas, a young girl will be rushed to the hospital to die from an overdose of a drug taken at a holiday party. And many thousands more like her, in an attempt to join in the festive spirits, will start down the road to serious substance abuse.  For drugs are once again becoming the "in thing."  Heroin has become the new trendy drug on college campuses --- a cheaper more concentrated form of heroin that has already led to a 34% increase in hospital emergency admissions for the drug this past year. And a recent University of Michigan survey found that the 12-year gradual decline in casual drug use has come to an abrupt halt.  College students and even eighth graders are reporting higher rates of drug use than they did in 1991 and 1992 and the number of sixth graders using drugs has tripled since 1975. 
  <P>

<DD>Crime, drugs and violence are part of the daily world in which children now live. So is it any wonder that youngsters today are so cynical about what this holiday season is supposed to represent?

However, the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America (CBAA), know there is something that we as adults can do this season to deliver a positive message to the young people in our communities. 

Underneath the great many tragedies that our young people see and experience everyday lies one fundamental factor. For too many of our young people, human life has become practically worthless. It means nothing to kill, it means nothing to steal or harm others or even self. 

I urge parents and all adults to take time this holiday season to do something special which will communicate to young people that human life, any human life has real value. If we could just get across this one thing to youngsters a great many personal disasters might be avoided. 

  <P>

<DD>I am often accused of being something of an expert in teaching the young the value of human life. However, I am only a grandmother who became active in programs to divert youth from involvement in Los Angeles street gangs by teaching them common sense morals and the value of life.  And CBAA, with the help of businesses and educators in our nation's schools now runs the American Set A Good Example Campaign which has involved 10,000 schools from all states and seven-million children. This program helps to teach children important moral values using The Way to Happiness book, a common sense guide to better living, written by the noted author and humanitarian, L. Ron Hubbard. 

One of the reasons the Set A Good Example Campaign has proven such as success--- participants and private sector business sponsors have been 
commended 15 times in the United States Congressional Record, applauded by governors of 44 states and by mayors across the country--- is that children discover through applying the moral principles contained in The Way to Happiness that human life does have value. 

This is something we cannot repeat too often to children and it is something that we should all continue to teach them through example. For that reason, we at CBAA are urging everyone to do something special this holiday season which reaffirms the value of human life. Perhaps a gift to a homeless person, Perhaps help out with some charity work involving children who have no adult guidance. Perhaps read something to the family which talks about how precious human life is which emphasizes that values and respect for human life are important.  <P>

<DD>Youngsters these days are deluged with messages of hopelessness, cruelty and despair. Nevertheless, their perceptions of the world---- and the role they see for themselves in that world----must be balanced with moral values and respect for human life.  Gifts are nice. But there is something more important than a sweater or a new video game we can give our young people this holiday season. Clothes and toyr wear out. Respect for self and others does not. It can last a life time. 

IT IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. 
Let me know your thoughts on the matter.

Check out the CBAA internet site at http://www.cbaa.org. There is a section there "For Children Only" which admonishes "Don't Use Harmful Drugs."
