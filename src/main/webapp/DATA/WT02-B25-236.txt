</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P>   
Anxiety and anxiety associated with other medical and psychological disorders are causes of significant distress, discomfort, dread, and foreboding in older individuals.  The intense distress associated with these symptoms leads people to seek relief either through the use of medical services or through self-medication with substances such as alcohol.</P>
<P>    Anxiety is often found in conjunction with depression.  The two groups of disorders share such symptoms as sleep disturbance, appetite changes, nonspecific digestive or cardiovascular complaints, irritability, and fatigue.</P>
<P>    The reasons for anxiety in late life are multiple.  Elderly individuals may experience sadness due to multiple losses and may fear isolation and death.  Chronic ill health, financial limitations, and diminished functional capacities also take a toll.  Recent advances in neurobiology indicate that four neurotransmitters are involved in the biochemistry of  anxiety disorder,</P>
 <P>   Careful assessment should be made of the factors contributing to anxiety in the older individual.  Family members and other persons familiar with the patient should be included in the assessment process.  Treatments may be psychological or pharmacological or both.  Special care must be used in prescribing medications because of the extra sensitivity of elderly people to these drugs.

<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>The Role of State Hospitals in the Care of Older Adults
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P>    In many states, functions that are not performed in other parts of the system of care are left to the state hospital.  State hospital’s may play a special function for older adults with mental illness.  During this period of rapid downsizing of state hospitals, it is important to know how the elderly might be affected.</P>
 <P>   Older adults were a major component of the state hospital population at mid-century.  However the rise of the nursing home industry and federal reimbursement for long term care outside of the hospital has led to a rapid decline in the number of older adults in these facilities.  Alternative settings
for these individuals, however, are often equally institutional.  Little is known about the impact of these changes on this vulnerable population.  Many of them are being cared for by providers who have financial incentives that may not be in the best interests of vulnerable populations.  Quality assurance programs and accountability may not have been developed well enough to protect the elderly.</P>
<P> 
   These kinds of concerns lead researchers <EM>(Semke, Fisher, Goldman, & Hirad, 1996)</EM> to pose a number of questions for advocates to consider.  Is there a residual function for the state hospital as a direct provider of psychiatric care?  Does it have a legitimate role to play in meeting needs not met in the market?  Are some functions not cost-effective on the local level due to the efficiencies of scale and duplications of effort?  Do older adults who received care in the community experience outcomes and quality of life equal to or better than they would have in the hospital?</P>
 <P>   Older adults are a segment of the state hospital population that currently received little research attention.  Advocates need more data to guide them as they seek to protect the interests of the geriatric population in their communities. <EM> (Semke, J., Fisher, W.H., Goldman, H.H., & Hirad, A., The Evolving Role of the State Hospital in the Care and Treatment of Older Adults: State Trends,  1984 to 1993, October 1996)</EM></P>

<HR SIZE=4>
                                    
 


<P>   While Maryland successfully obtained insurance parity for  treatment of mental illness/brain disorder via the 1994 law enacted by the State Legislature, it is still important to determine the extent of the health insurance coverage benefits which protect you and your family. Examine your policy carefully.  You will find most benefits described in a policy section entitled "medical/surgical benefits," or something similar.  To find your coverage for treatment of a brain disorder, look under " Mental Illness/Substance Abuse."</P>

<UL>

<LI>Check your co-payment requirements.  Many insurance policies will require that your co-payment for brain disorder treatment (your share of the cost of treatment, diagnostic procedure, hospitalization, outpatient visit, or visit to a physician’s office) will be almost twice as high as co-payments required for treatment of  physical diseases.
<LI>Check your "lifetime benefits."  Many insurance policies limit the lifetime benefits payable for treatment of mental illness to half (or less) of the lifetime benefits payable for treatment of other disorders.
<LI>Check your hospitalization benefits.  Many policies limit benefits if you are hospitalized for treatment of a mental illness.  These limited benefits may pay half of the actual cost of hospitalization.
<LI>Check your "treatment benefits."  Many policies limit the number of treatments.
<LI>   If you are not sure about the benefits provided in your health insurance policy, check with your employer’s benefits department with your insurance agent, or with your attorney.  Please do not let what they may think prevent you from checking, or from seeking a policy that provides more inclusive and equitable coverage.

<HR SIZE=4>
                                    



	<P>  Older individuals with mental illness are often in need of both mental health and aging services.  The confusion, according to Allen Jensen, researcher at the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project (IHPP) of George Washington University, is which agencies should provide services to these seniors.  To address this problem IHPP is heading  a three-year project funded by the Administration on Aging to develop community-based partnership models in seven sites across six states.  Baltimore County Bureau of Mental Health/Core Service Agency is conducting one of the model projects.</P>

	<P>IHPP has contracted with Way Station to provide technical assistance to partnership participants.  Another local provider, Montgomery House, is working with the Montgomery County Area Agency on Aging to increase its capacity to serve seniors with serious mental illnesses.  (IAPSRS PSR Connection Newsletter - Issue 2, 1996, submitted by Grady O’Rear, CEO, Way Station).</P>

<A NAME="Depression Among Aging">

<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>Depression Among Aging Persons with Schizophrenia</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P>   Suprisingly little is known about the well-being of persons age 55 and older with schizophrenia who live in the community.  This information is important to families who now have an older relative with schizophrenia and to families trying to anticipate the future of their middle aged son or daughter.  It is also important to the mental health system because the number of older persons with schizophrenia living in the community is expected to double in the next 30 years.</P>

<P>  Carl I. Cohen, director of geriatric psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center, and his colleagues used symptoms of depression as an indicator of well-being in later life.  It is well established that older persons with high levels of depressive symptoms are more at risk for physical illnesses, diminished social functioning, and death.</P>

<P>  Cohen and his co-researchers found that 44% of their 117 persons with schizophrenia had clinical levels of depression.  This three times the level of depression reported in a general sample of older persons in New York City.  Depression was associated with positive symptoms as well as the following nonpsychiatric variables:

<OL>
<LI><U> Low income.</U>  Poverty was strongly associated with depression in later life.  The difference in mean monthly income between those who were depressed and those who were not depressed was $117.  The authors pointed out that it may be possible to produce a decline in depression by as much as $4 a day.  
<LI> <U> Supportive Network.</U> Limited social support networks were related to depression.  This was especially true of a lower level of material support from informal caregivers rather than the formal network that made a difference.  This finding suggested that encouraging more informal network members to provide more material support, perhaps with subsidies, may help alleviate depression.
<LI> <U> Limitations on activity.</U>  Physical disability and depression appear to influence each other with elderly disabled persons who have depression having lower rates of recovery of physical functioning.  Comprehensive medical treatment, home care assistance, improved access to transportation, and the like, may reduce depression in those with physical disabilities.
<LI> <U>  Age.</U>  In this study, the rate of depression went down with schizophrenia, but not for men.  It appears that women in late middle age, rather than very old women may be at more risk for depression or less likely to recover from it or both.

</OL>

<P>   Cohen and colleagues conclude that many of the factors associated with depression could be altered and thereby increase the wellbeing of older persons with schizophrenia.

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



	<P>Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a nationally known psychiatrist and researcher in the field of mental illness, made some very intriguing suggestions about ways to change the mental health system in his address at the AMI of Maryland Luncheon in Baltimore on April 28th.  Those that attended were in for a treat because Torrey is a powerful speaker and he tells it like he sees it.  Dr. Torrey recommended:

<OL>
<LI> That we develop a system of outpatient commitment.  People would have conditional releases from the hospital to an outpatient setting.  They could be returned to the hospital if they did not cooperate with treatment.
<LI>State law should be changed to make it possible to involuntarily hospitalize people on the basis of need for treatment in addition to the dangerousness to self and others provisions.  Too many people are going untreated.
<LI>There should be wider use of representative payees.  The use of drugs and alcohol among people with mental illnesses is high.  These individuals worsen their conditions by spending their SSI checks on such substances.
<LI> We need to differentiate mental illness from mental health problems.
<LI> The National Institute of Mental health should be abolished and research on mental illnesses be done in a Brain Research Institute.
<LI> Psychiatry and neurology should be merged and the State Department of Mental Hygiene abolished.

</OL>

	<P>Actually it appears to us that the Medicaid Waiver in Maryland will tend to blend mental illness and mental health problems (See article on Medicaid Waiver in this issue.)  The Waiver does not specifically separate the two, everyone would presumably be treated by a general physician and would be referred on  to the CSA if they need a specialty service.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"> <H2>Opening Minds, Improving Lives-Anti-Stigma Campaign</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Maryland has embraced the new national campaign "Open Your Mind", an anti-stigma effort targeted to decision-makers and influentials in all areas of government, business, education and the media.  Lead by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI's) president, Rona Purdy, and in Maryland by project coordinator, Bev Hoffberg of AMI of Metropolitan Baltimore, the campaign promises to be an exciting endeavor funded by a first-time ever coalition of pharmaceuticals.  Kicked off nationally in Washington, D.C. with a press conference, the 5-year campaign hopes to raise several million dollars to end discrimination in health care, housing, education and all eaconomic opportunities. </P>

<P>In March, NAMI held a weekend training for all state coordinators in St. Louis, Missouri, attended by Brenda Hohman who will be working with Bev Hoffberg.  The training briefed everyone about the campaigns focus in several messages that will be communicated throughout the campaign:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Mental Illnesses Are Brain Disorders.
<LI>Treatment Works!
<LI>Discrimination Must End.
<LI>Stop Unfair Economic Burden!

</UL><BR>

<P>These important messages will be delivered via three tracks, each with their own activities.  The tracks are 1) the grassroots, 2) science and treatment, and 3) anit-discrimination.  Because of the nature of the three tracks, many activities will overlap.</P>

<P>AMI of Maryland will officially kick-off the statewide anti-stigma campaign at the state convention to be held at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, on June 7 & 8.  This year's convention is lead by Carolyn Knight, president of AMI of Montgomery County.  Each affiliate which does not currently own one will receive a fax machine funded by the Service System Improvement grant from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to assist with campaign communications.  The affiliates will also receive exciting campaign materials including posters, brochures and buttons and more information to assist local efforts.  We hope to see everyone at this fun-filled and worthwhile event!</P>

<P>Convention sponsors for 1996 include the following companies who have made early commitments for support:

<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2> NAMI and Young Families</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>  
   "It is imperative that we do more outreach
to young families facing the difficulites of raising
a child with a neurobiological disorder,"  Laurie
Flynn stated last winter in The Journal, a
quarterly publication of the California Alliance for
the Mentally Ill.  From its inception, NAMI has
worked to provide support, education, and
advocacy for individuals of all ages with serious
and persistent mental illnesses.</P>

 <P>    Yet, today, in our 16th year, families of
children under the age of eighteen constitute a
relatively small percentage of our organization's
membership.  This is troubling for two reasons. 
The first is what NAMI has to offer young
families.  When looking back to the age of  onset
of their ill family member's symptoms, at least
half of NAMI families admit that their child or
sibling was under eighteen.  Their experinces can
help young families as they face the challenges of
finding services and making the transition from
childhood's school-based systems to the adult-
services sector.  The second reason is that NAMI
membership must give serious consideration to the
long-term prospects of NAMI's existence and its
continued ability to advocate on behalf of persons
with persistent and severe mentally illness.</P>

 </P>    To continue renewing NAMI's fellowship,
the referral of young families and efforts to meet
their unique needs must be a priority.  Unlike
older families who in many instances are retired
and looking primarily for support group services,
young families are in need of a greater array of
assistance from those already experienced in
obtaining services for their family member.</P>

<P>     In particular, young families require
assistance in linking up with experienced
healthcare professionals who will provide a
diagnosis and treatment for their youngster with a
neurobiological disorder.  These families also
need detailed information about how to deal with
the local school systems that significantly impact
the education and related services available to
their child.  They may also require referrals to
local family-service agencies.</P>

<P>    
 Serving families of children and
adolescents with neurobiological disorders is a
challenge for many NAMI affiliates, especially at
the local level.  Active members may feel unable
to provide the level of support and information
young families need.  Addressing this issue,
NAMI's board of directors decided that the
national headquarters should include one staff
member devoted exclusively to young family
outreach.  Mrs. Brenda Souto was appointed in
mid-November as the young family outreach
coordintor.  Mrs. Souto, a professional outreach
specialist, has been active in the child and
adolescent network of AMI of Montgomery
County, Maryland.</P>

<P>     During the next months the new family
outreach coordinator will provide affiliates with
information they can use in answering inquiries
from young families with a child or adolescent
identified with a neurobiological disorder.  She is
developing a NAMI brochure welcoming young
families and a NAMI Rolodex card. (A fact sheet
for young families is already in distribution
through the NAMI helpline)  One of Mrs. Souto's
early efforts will provide affiliates techniques to
increase referrals from healthcare professionals
who see young families.  She also plans to
elaborate on a start-up manual for children and
adolescent groups that will build on the NAMI-
CAN Start Up Kit  Carol Howe developed a few
years ago.  The manual will provide AMI
affiliates with resources to assist young family
groups within affiliates.  This resource is expected
to be available at the July 1996 NAMI convention
in Nashville.</P>
