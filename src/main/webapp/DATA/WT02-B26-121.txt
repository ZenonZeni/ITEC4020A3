&quot;For nearly a century, Barron's has been the information source of choice among smart investors. If you read us for a while -- if you learn how to use us effectively -- you will be well-informed. But you also need to develop your own investment personality. Where do you draw the line between prudent risk-taking and foolish risk? How do you balance the patience essential for successful long-term investing against the need to cut losses decisively?</P>




<P>&quot;Barron's can help you here also. We have our own strong personality: We are an intelligent, independent voice for the serious investor. We are blunt. You may not always agree with us, but you will know where we stand and why. Above all, we seek to be useful to investors week in and week out. We want to deliver exactly the information you need to make your decisions.</P>




<P>&quot;Like any tool, Barron's takes some getting used to. In a sense, it represents an ongoing dialogue between readers and writers, and what you see is the result of 75 years of conversation. We invite you to join us.&quot;</P>
