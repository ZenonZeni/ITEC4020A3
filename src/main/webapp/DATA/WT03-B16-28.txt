<h4>October 1995<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="ia">INTERNATIONAL</A></H2>
<p><i>The 1995 Towers Perrin World-wide</i> Total Remuneration <i>study is now available. The new study has been expanded to include 22 countries. It is clear that increasingly firms are adopting an integrated, total remuneration approach to compensation and benefit management. But why?</i>

<h4>Managing total remuneration on a global scale</h4>

<p>'Total remuneration' encompasses base and variable pay, long-term incentives, benefits, compulsory contributions to government-run benefit programmes and perquisites. Increasingly, firms are taking this broad view when they develop compensation and benefit management policies.

<p>Driving this change are today's more demanding business realities: sharper competition, rising costs and 
the need to achieve improved performance with fewer resources to please ever more 
demanding customers and 
shareholders. As a result, more and more companies are working to ensure that their 
investment in human 
resources directly supports their business objectives, and that their remuneration strategies 
are closely aligned with their business strategies.

<p>The total remuneration approach is a powerful human resource management tool. It can have a direct, 
positive im-pact on business performance, profits and returns to shareholders by helping companies exert more control over labour costs and spend more wisely when they look for staff with the 
particular skills required to 
execute business plans. Companies can also use this approach to determine how total 
remuneration expenditures 
should be allocated among direct cash payments, benefits and other components to deliver 
better value to 
employees and the company alike.

<p>Developing a total remuner-ation strategy is a complex matter. It often requires additional data and new methodologies for measuring the value to em-ployees of specific programmes. The challenge takes on an added dimension for companies operating internationally. In addition, they need to understand the way pay practices, legal requirements and cultural factors differ from country to country. Nevertheless, multinational companies 
increasingly recognise the importance of total remuneration as a framework that can accommodate local differences 
whilst also providing a consistent approach across countries.

<p>Key steps in the total remuneration development process include:

<ul>
<li>objective setting: defining the business and cost objectives that the programme must 
support, and also determining the organisation capabilities and employee competencies that are needed to carry 
out the business strategy
<li>peer group identification: selecting those organisations with which the company 
competes for talent, 
and then determining how to compete for labour more effectively
<li>data gathering and valuation: collecting the necessary information on remuneration in 
comparable 
organisations and quantifying the value of benefit programmes, long-term incentives and other noncash compensation to enable useful comparisons to be made
<li>analysis and strategy development: evaluating how the company measures up to 
comparable firms 
and deciding on a total remuneration strategy for reducing any competitive disadvantages. The strategy should also consider problems such as the financing of benefit programmes (eg tax efficiency, vendor strategy).
</ul>

<p>Once the total remuneration framework and database have been developed, the 
organisation is in a much 
better position to make strategic decisions on matters such as:

<ul>
<li>the selection of performance measures necessary to drive the business
<li>how best to explain the total remuneration programme to employees so they understand 
the full value of their 
compensation and benefits
<li>what benefit choices and levels of coverage make sense in terms of the needs of em
ployees and the resources 
of the company
<li>how to measure the cost-to-value ratio of compensation and benefit programmes to find 
more efficient ways of 
delivering the programme to employees.
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, companies trying to compete effectively need both human resource 
strategies that match their business vision, and an approach to managing compensation and benefit programmes that provides the maximum value to employees at the lowest possible cost. For a growing number of organisations, the total remuneration framework provides just that.

<h4>Nationwide pay agreement for 1996 and 1997</h4>

<p>The central employers organisation and the trade unions have agreed minimum salary increases for the period from 1 November 1995 to 31 January 1998. Additional pay increases may be agreed at company level. The agreement must now be accepted or rejected by branch industry employer organisations before 28 September 1995.

<p>If accepted, the minimum increases will be:

<ul>
<li>1 November 1995: 1.8%
<li>1 October 1996: 1.3%.
</ul>

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>
<h4>Drastic developments in pensions scene</h4>

<p>For decades successive governments have attempted, and failed, to reform Italy's bloated social security system, Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS). Having received parliamentary approval on 4 August 1995, the long-awaited pensions reform legislation is now law.

<p>These changes will affect all employees, except industrial sector managers ('dirgenti'). Further, because of the recent privatisation of their own pension system (INPDAI), industrial sector dirigenti are also potentially affected as they have the right to opt for INPS benefits by 31 December 1995.

<p>The reform is far reaching and the implications significant. Although in the recent past employers have postponed addressing pension issues for their employees in Italy, the future framework is now clear and employers should act now.

<p>The reform:

<ul>
<li>increases employer INPS contributions from 18.83% to 23.66% of covered 
earnings
<li>introduces a new 'contributory method' benefit accrual system
<li>significantly reduces expected benefits for individuals at higher earnings levels by introducing a cap (ItL 132 million or approximately US$80,000) on earnings that are considered for pensions 
<li>attempts to shift pension responsibilities to the private sector by introducing significant incentives for private plans
<li>removes the unique seniority pension system ('pensioni di anzianitˆ') whereby un-reduced state retirement pensions were provided after 35 years of contributions, irrespective of age
<li>introduces incentives to postpone drawing retirement benefits until age 65
<li>removes sex discrimination - immediately for new entrants to the workforce and gradually for existing workers.
</ul>

<p>At the earliest opportunity employers should:

<ul>
<li>Review the new retirement benefits, taking into account the changes in social security benefit provision. 
<li>If a pension plan already exists, it should be reviewed in the light of the new law and in terms of the benefits it provides, its legal structure and its financing, including tax, costs and funding implications. Of special concern are those plans in which the benefit formulae deduct state benefits because of the significant increase in company costs that could result.
<li>If no retirement plan exists, review the need for one, either for senior employees or at all levels.
</ul>

<h4><a name="it2">Benchmarking for top executive reward and management development</a></h4>

<p>A recent benchmarking exercise for top executive reward and management development policies has revealed a very unstructured approach among Italian companies. The exercise - sponsored by Benetton, ENI, Fiat, IBM, IRI, Montedison, Olivetti, Omnitel, Pirelli and Schneider - collected data from 35 Italian and multina-tional companies covering approximately 400 senior managers. The most important trends revealed were:

<ul>
<li>The recruitment and development of top executives is often the result of friendship or links with present management. There are seldom formal, objective policies and practices in place for re-cruitment and assessment of senior managers.
<li>Career paths tend to follow one functional route. Inter-functional careers are rare.
<li>Approaches to perfor-mance appraisal tend to be unstructured.
<li>Little importance is attached to training of top managers.
<li>MBO practices do exist in theory, but in practice they are seldom adhered to. Variable compensation packages are increasing in popularity - typically with 80% of remuneration still fixed - but in reality bonuses aren't always linked to actual performance. Frequently, even managers who do not achieve their performance targets still receive their bonuses, and thus the concept of 'pay-at-risk' is not well established.
</ul>

<p>The survey has raised some very important motivational issues for senior management in Italy, and the main trends and best practices will be presented and discussed during a forthcoming Towers Perrin event in Milan on 30 November 1995, entitled 'Top Manager Management and Development Policies in Companies in Italy'.

<h4>Denomination of the zloty</h4>

<p>With effect from 1 January 1995, the Polish zloty has been redenominated and coins (which disappeared when inflation rendered them almost valueless) have been reintroduced. The phasing out of the old zloty will take place over two years, dur-ing 
which time both new and old notes will be legal tender. The new zloty will be worth 
10,000 of the old, equivalent to US$42.5. The average monthly wage is approximately US$300.

<p>Despite a lengthy phase-out period, the changes have already prompted many 
employers to issue addenda to contracts of employment to avoid confusion at a later stage. They have also amended pay rates in existing collective agreements.

<h4><a name="pl2">Employment of foreigners: work permits</a></h4>

<p>As part of its efforts to combat unemployment, the government has issued new, stricter regulations to govern work permits. The 1995 changes are:

<ul>
<li>a more complex, three-step procedure to justify employment of a foreigner for a given post:
  <ol>
  <li>application to the employment office (as before)

  <li>request for a residence permit

  <li>'named' work permit for an individual employee required

  </ol>
<li>employer must pay a fee equal to one month's minimum wage
<li>penalties for breaches of the regulations can be as high as US$2,000.
</ul>

<h4><a name="pl3">Group life assurance boost</a></h4>

<p>A small change in corporate tax treatment may be the first step towards increased use by employers of group life assurance contracts.

<p>Prior to early 1995, an em-ployer had to deduct employer-paid premia from post-tax profits. Now the premia can be treated as a business cost and paid out of pre-tax profits. The tax regime for employees has not changed; premia are still regarded as employee 
income and are taxable.

<h4><a name="pl4">Use of short-term contracts restricted</a></h4>

<p>Social security regulations have been changed to tackle the excessive use of short-term contracts on which no social security contributions are required.

<p>Previously, employers could issue temporary contracts of employment of up to 30 days without being liable for social contributions at the normal rate of just under 49% of gross earnings. A single day between consecutive contracts was sufficient to retain 
exemption.

<p>The change in regulations has shortened social security-exempt short-term contracts to 
15 days or less, and if the same employer signs a second short-term contract within 60 days of the first, the two will be combined and the full period assessed for social security contributions.

<h4>Retroactive tax refunds to be expected?</h4>

<p>The income bands on which per- sonal income taxes are calculated have been 
broadened and backdated to 1 January 1995. The changes will result in wide-ranging tax 
bill recalculations and, if the administrative burden is manageable, potential refunds.

<p>The new tax bands are as follow:

<pre>
          <b>Previous income band     New income band</b>
<b>Tax rate</b> (in millions of roubles) (in millions of roubles)
  12%     Up to 5                 Up to 10
  20%     5 - 10                  10 - 50
  30%     Over 10	           Over 50

<h2><a name="es">SPAIN</a></h2>
<h4>Will history repeat itself?</h4>

<p>Almost three years ago, important draft insurance legislation failed to become law ecause an early election prevented the Senate from ratifying it. Now the draft legislation, albeit in revised form, finds itself once more approved by Congress and waiting to be debated and ratified by the Senate. 

<p>But history looks set to re-peat itself as the withdrawal of Catalan Party support for the government threatens to bring next year's spring election forward to this year's autumn.

<p>The draft legislation's fate is being anticipated with great interest. Once law, it would bring the Spanish insurance market into line with European Union directives and also have a profound affect on pensions. The main features are:

<ul>
<li>the banning of book reserves as a financing vehicle for company pension plans, leaving only two acceptable alternatives: qualified pension plans or group insurance
<li>tax treatment that clearly favours qualified pension plans, reflecting government desires to foment this form of provision
<li>a transition period of three years to give companies time to adjust.
</ul>

<p>The key differences between the new draft and the one that fell three years ago are:

<ul>
<li>For new plans created during the transition period, contributions made to fund past 

benefits will qualify for tax relief under identical conditions as for existing pension plans. This is a great advantage as current pensions legislation is not so favourable to the creation of new plans.
<li>'Re-equilibrium' plans, to amortise existing deficits, must be filed with the office of Director General of Insurance, but they will not need its approval. This will make implementation of newly qualified plans much quicker.
<li>Existing plans that are funded through deposit administration contracts (or similar vehicles) and that transfer their fund to a qualified fund will not pay capital gains tax on the accumulated gains at the time of transfer.
<li>The deficit amortisation period is extended from 10 years to 15. Every year a minimum 
of 5% of the overall deficit must be amortised so that at least 50% has been amortised by 
the 10th year.
<li>Companies in the same group can meet their obligations through a single plan and 
fund, as long as all companies with obligations in the group participate.
<li>A clause in an earlier draft, which would have permitted the calculation of vested rights 
without salary projection, has been removed. This will cause the cost of defined benefit 
pension plans to increase, especially for companies with high turnovers.
</ul>

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>Pay increases stipulated in collective agreements</h4>

<p>A large number of employers' organisations affiliated to the Swedish Employers Confedera-tion have entered into collective agreements on salary increases for 1995 and 1996. These agreements all stipulate minimum payroll increases, and several grant employees a min-imum base salary increase.

<p>The average payroll increases found in 55 collective agreements covering different 
industry sectors are:
<pre>
	     <b>1995     1996</b>

Workers	     3.8%     3.8%

Salaried
employees    3.6%     3.6%

</pre>

<p>Pay negotiations, which may well result in additional salary increases, are continuing at 
a company level with local trade unions.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>Companies keep the lid on 1995 salary costs</h4>

<p>Despite the strength of the US economy, employers are keeping the lid on merit salary increases again this year, according to Towers Perrin's latest salary management survey. The survey findings emphasise employers' preoccupation with cost control and the continuing shift from merit pay to performance-based incentives and lump sum payments that do not become part of fixed salary costs.

<p>The survey sample included more than 1,350 companies in 52 industry groups with annual sales ranging from US$100 million to more than US$10 billion. Their responses show that actual 1995 merit costs for the survey's three employee categories were almost half a percentage point below what was planned for 1995 and several tenths of a percent below 1994's actual merit costs. On average, the companies surveyed will give 1995 merit increases of 3.6% to top management and exempt employees (ie middle man-agement, professional and technical staff) and 3.5% to non-exempt (ie hourly paid) employees. 
These levels are still above projected 1995 inflation, and employees will not experience 
erosion of purchasing power.

<p>The survey shows that the proportion of companies offering some form of variable pay 
to employees below the executive ranks continues to increase steadily: 41% of respondents, 
up from 35% in 1994. Group/ team incentives and spot, or discretionary, bonuses are the 
most common variable pay vehicles, followed by gain sharing plans and nonqualified profit 
sharing. Rewards under these programmes are generally in addition to merit increases.

<p>The survey results also show that most companies have now introduced some type of 
flexible work arrangement to help reduce 'work and personal life' conflicts as part of the 
total reward mix. Flextime is by far the most common alternative work arrangement, 
reported by almost half (49%) of the companies surveyed.

<h4><a name="us2">New SEC view of SERPs sparks concern</a></h4>

<p>Companies that offer supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) or other non-
qualified deferred compensation arrangements may need to register those plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a new SEC staff interpretation of US securities law. Plans that involve employee 'contributions' may need to be registered - regardless of whether those contributions are merely bookkeeping entries or whether the plan offers investment in actual or phantom employer stock.

<p>Under the new interpretation, SEC registration would generally be required for many 
defined contribution SERPs and other nonqualified arrangements that let executives defer 
receipt of current compensation until some later date (eg retirement). Some plans that limit 
registration to a handful of top executives could escape registration.

<p>Registering SERPs and other nonqualified deferred compen-sation plans would add 
only a slight administrative burden (ie the need to file Form S-8) for publicly traded 
companies in the US. Foreign-owned companies that use Form 20-F to register with the SEC are eligible to use Form S-8 to register their non-qualified plans. However, the new SEC staff position has significant implications for companies that do not already register. 
In some cases, a plan registration requirement could effectively preclude such companies 
from offering nonqualified plans.

<p>Thus, private companies - in particular many foreign-owned ones - are understandably 
concerned by the SEC's apparent policy change, especially as the agency has not formally announced its new position but is nonetheless enforcing it in individual cases. Towers Perrin is participating in efforts to encourage the SEC staff to rethink this matter or, at the very least, to openly acknowledge the change and provide formal guidance for employers.
