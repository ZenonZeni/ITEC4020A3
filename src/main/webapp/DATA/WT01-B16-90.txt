<H3>Current Status and Future Programme of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor Monju. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/shibabio.html">Kiminori

<P>
Monju is a 280 MWe loop-type power reactor using plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel, with liquid sodium
 coolant, completed April 1991 and currently undergoing pre-operational testing.

<P>
R&D work is described. Development work on Monju has involved scaling up of the experimental Joyo plant,
 adding new technologies. The joint venture MOZART project between UK and Japan was performed
 to achieve appropriate core design. In the fuel development programme performance to 130 000 MWd/t
 burnup and to a neutron fluence of 2.3 &#215; 1023 neutrons cm<SMALL><SUP>-2</SMALL>
</SUP> s<SMALL><SUP>-1</SMALL></SUP> (energy > 0.1 MeV) was aimed at. Monju
 has advanced heat-transport and fuel-handling performances. Its steam generator has been especially studied,
 with additional tests ensuring no water leakage. Average fuel burnup is 80 000 Mwd/t, and the cooling system
 is of a three loop design.

<P>
JAPC constructed Monju under a contract with PNC, utilising their joint experience. Over 320 other firms
 participated in construction, which began October 1985. The location is Siraki on the Tsuruga Peninsula,
 400 km west of Tokyo.

<P>
Pre-operational tests (which are to confirm components and system performance, evaluate design margins,
 determine operational ranges of adjustable parameters in systems, and acquire test data to verify design
 methods) are in two phases: functional tests before fuel loading, and start-up tests after fuel loading. 
The former, conducted between May 1991 and December 1992, consist of assembling a dummy core, 
operation of fuel handling components and control-rod drive mechanisms in gases and sodium, pre-service
 inspection by the in-service inspection equipment, preheating of the system components and sodium charging, 
and leak rate measurements of the reactor containment vessel. These are described in detail. Start-up rests, 
begun December 1992 and scheduled to end December 1995, include tests for fuel loading and criticality, 
reactor physics, nuclear heating, and power-up. Nuclear heating tests are currently in progress.

<P>
The experimental fast reactor Joyo's function was to obtain basic FBR technology and check core 
characteristics. Monju as a prototype reactor represents the next stage of Japan's FBR development
 programme, and its role is to demonstrate performance, safety, reliability and operability of an FBR,
 plus guidelines for the economic efficiency of the demonstration reactors which will follow it. Results
 obtained from Monju's operation will be valuable to FBR technology and development, and because
 international cooperation in FBR development is important, research engineers from USA and Europe
 will be invited to make use of Monju under the 'PNC International Fellowship Programme' and other exchanges.
