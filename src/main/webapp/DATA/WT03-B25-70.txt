<BLOCKQUOTE>

Equipment and devices to test the thickness of plated, painted and powder coated finishes are displayed . . .<P>


<H4>X-Ray Fluorescence Plating Thickness Testers</H4>

The XRF 5300H x-ray fluorescence system is driven by a full Microsoft Windowsr application, Xpert™ for Windows.<P>

The XRF-5300H chamber offers a large sample positioning area, tube target selection (tungsten or high-performance molybdenum), stepper or closed-loop servo stage positioning and single or dual monitor setups. One or two fully automatic, built-in motorized programmable detector filters are available, along with laser-assisted focusing.<P>

Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, New York, 516-349-8300, Fax: 516-349-8321.<P>

<H4>Portable Non-Destructive Thickness Gages</H4>

H10/2 and E10/2 Series thickness gages measure non-magnetic coatings on steel or non-conductive coatings on non-ferrous metals. Anything from plated to painted to anodized, galvanized and powder finishes can be measured.<P>

These lightweight testers operate on battery power or AC adapter. They are ideal for the shop, lab or in the field.<P>

Series 10/2 have six non-volatile calibration memories, batch facility and multi-point calibration. The H10/2 and E10/2 models use the latest microprocessor technology. User friendly software and accuracy of plus or minus one pct make the testers reliable.<P>

Kocour Co., Chicago, Illinois, 312-847-1111, Fax: 312-847-3399.<P>

<H4>Precise Coating Thickness Measurement</H4>

The Deltascoper and Isoscoper MP2C and 3C feature plug-in smart probes with automatic probe recognition and read/write memory for application-specific data.<P>

The Deltascope measures non-ferrous coatings (copper, chromium and zinc) and all non-conductive coatings (paint, rubber, enamel) on iron and steel.<P>

The Isoscope measures non-conductive coatings on non-ferrous substrates such as copper, brass and aluminum, as well as anodize coatings on aluminum.<P>

Fischer Technology, Windsor, Connecticut, 203-683-0781, Fax: 203-688-8496.<P>

<H4>One-Point Calibration</H4>

The hand-held CGX Series of coating thickness measuring gages features one-point calibration, right-angle probe and Stats Plus. The upgraded series is used for measuring film thickness of paint and powder coating on aluminum, brass or steel; anodizing on aluminum; cadmium, zinc, nickel, copper, Teflon or enamel on steel.<P>

The one-point calibration makes it possible to accurately measure conductive and non-conductive coatings over pretreated substrates. The gage accommodates a right-angle probe that measures the anodized coating thickness of ID's of cylindrical aluminum parts.<P>

CMI International, Inc., Elk Grove Village, Illinois, 708-439-4404, Fax: 708-446-5248.<P>

<H4>Paint Inspection Gage</H4>

The Rotogroover accessory for the paint inspection gages provides the smallest possible footprint for coating film thickness measurement. It also effectively incises elastomer-elastomer coating-substrate systems that have been resistant to incision with standard linear cutting tips.<P>

Micro-Metrics Co., Atlanta, Georgia, 404-325-3243.<P>



<H4>Coating Thickness Gage</H4>

The Check-Liner DCF-900 accurately measures the thickness of paint, plating, coatings and galvanizing on iron or steel. The gage incorporates Enhanced Magnetic Calibration™ for longer lasting, driftless calibration and accuracy over the range of 0.1 to 40 mils. Other models are available for use with non-ferrous metals.<P>

Electromatic Equipment Co., Inc., Cedarhurst, New York, 516-295-4300, Fax: 516-295-4399.<P>

<H4>Gage Features Separate Probe</H4>

PosiTector 6000 Series coating thickness gages feature the Separate probe. This combination provides for instant auto-calibration to NIST, completely interchangeable probes and a combination probe that automatically measures on both ferrous and non-ferrous substrates.<P>

The gages are accurate to plus or minus one pct and feature automatic temperature compensation, stability warning indicator and optional averaging and memory capabilities.<P>

DeFelsko Corp., Ogdensburg, New York, 315-393-4450, Fax: 315-393-8471.<P>

<H4>Combination Coating Thickness Gage</H4>

The QuaNix 1500 combination coating thickness gage measures powder coatings over both ferrous and non-ferrous substrates.<P>

Two integrated probes enable the gage to take readings even in hard-to-reach areas. The gage also features memory, block segmentation, instant averaging, high/low readings and RS-232 downloading capability.<P>

Automation USA, West-minster, Maryland, 800-678-4370, Fax: 410-857-3818.<P>

<H4>Thickness Testing on Small Areas</H4>

The XRF-8500 x-ray fluorescence system measures on ultra-small areas, less than 0.002 inch (0.05 mm) in width. Other features include AT compatible computer with 32-bit processor and color graphics; large slotted chamber for measurement on nearly any size and shape part; fully programmable servomotor-driven state; high-energy, micro-focus beryllium window x-ray tube; and three-dimensional topographical mapping.<P>

Twin City, Inc., North Tonawanda, New York, 716-692-8855, Fax: 716-692-3265.<P>

<H4>Modular Technology in Finishing Gage</H4>

The Elcometer 355 uses a two-part combination of a host instrument and probe module in a portable coating thickness gage. The system is plus or minus one pct accurate.<P>

The 14-key standard unit provides memory to 5,000 readings, auto-batching of data and simple statistical information. The 28-key unit retains 10,000 readings in batches, has full statistical capability, including average and counted modes.<P>

Elcometer, Inc., Rochester Hills, Michigan, 810-650-0500, Fax: 810-650-0501.<P>

<H4>Coating Thickness Tester</H4>

Model 200 portable coating thickness tester weighs less than three pounds and measures thicknesses up to 31.5 mils. It makes measurements instantly and stores data and printing results as needed.<P>

The system stores calibrations for up to eight materials. A single key stroke allows the 200 to automatically perform statistical calculations on up to 1,500 measurements. Values are provided for average, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values, number of samples, lot number and test date.<P>

Kett U.S., Villa Park, California, 714-630-5100, Fax: 714-630-5105.<P>

<H4>Small, Quick Thickness Gage</H4>

The Minitest 100F and 200F are said to be the smallest and quickest, digital microprocessor-controlled coating thickness measurement gages. They measure non-magnetic coatings, such as plating, paint and plastics on steel.<P>

Elektro-Physik USA, Inc., Arlington Heights, Illinois.<P>

<H4>Digital Thickness Gage</H4>

This digital coating thickness gage measures any non-magnetic coating on steel or all non-conductive coatings on non-ferrous substrates.<P>
