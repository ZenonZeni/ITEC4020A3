<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly being used
at the design stage for the evaluation of air distribution and
smoke control systems in a wide range of building types.
<P>
CFD computer software operates by numerically solving the equations
governing fluid flow <A HREF="#References" >[1] </A>. These comprise
conservation statements for mass, momentum, energy and turbulence
parameters. The equations contain partial derivatives, are highly
non-linear and require an iterative solution procedure<I><B> 
</B></I>to yield results.
<H2>What must be <A NAME="defined">defined </A>when using CFD
software?</H2>

<P>
The process of running CFD software involves defining the factors
which drive the flow (boundary conditions) such as supply air
diffusers, natural ventilation openings, exhaust locations and
flow rates, heat gains, and hot or cold surfaces together with
any objects or obstructions in the space. These are mapped to
a computational grid which forms three-dimensional volumes of
space completely filling the enclosure to be modelled. The equations
are solved at each one of these 'control volumes', usually called
'cells' in 'finite-volume' codes and 'elements' in the alternative
'finite-element' codes. Historically, the finite-volume approach
was developed in cartesian (rectangular) geometries. The finite-element
method has traditionally allowed more complex and hence realistic
geometries to be modelled although the developments which have
taken place in CFD mean that many of the old distinctions have
become blurred. More accurate techniques for numerically integrating
the flow equations coupled with complex geometry capability in
finite-volume codes provide a similar level of functionality to
the traditional finite-element approach. Finite element codes
themselves are changing, further reducing the distance between
them.
<P>
The user has control over the grid and it is the resolution of
the grid which can have an important influence on the accuracy
of results. The finer the grid the better but the longer it will
take to achieve a solution. A typical grid will comprise many
thousands of 'cells' <A HREF="#References" >[2, 3] </A>. Most
commercial CFD software uses the finite-volume approach to form
the numerical integral of the partial differential equations.
Regarding complexity of modelling, much can still be done with
cartesian geometry representations - taking advantage of the much
easier model building and faster execution speed.
<P>
In using CFD, which places major demands on computer processor
speed and RAM (memory), there is always a compromise to be made
between accuracy and speed of solution. However, CFD software
is becoming more user-friendly and computers very much faster
such that high-specification PC's (e.g. fast 486's, Pentium and
Pentium Pro) can be particularly cost-effective in running CFD
codes and contributing successfully within the time-frame of the
design process.
<H2>How are the <A NAME="results">results </A>presented?</H2>

<P>
Once a solution is obtained the results can be viewed in graphical
form as flow patterns (vector plots), temperature and smoke contours,
etc. (An example is shown in <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1 </A>.)
The numerical values can be interpreted to make judgements about
the acceptability of the thermal environment in terms of air velocities,
temperatures, temperature gradients and ventilation effectiveness.
In fire modelling it is temperatures and the development and movement
of smoke which is the focus of interest either in a 'steady-state'
form or evolving with time.<BR>

<H2>Are CFD results <A NAME="realistic">realistic</A>?</H2>

<P>
Validation is always an issue with any computer calculation method.
With CFD the issue is more complex than usual because of the influence
the user can have over the quality of results. This is particularly
important in the context of setting boundary conditions, defining
the computational grid and procuring converged solutions in high
Rayleigh Number (highly buoyant) flow fields within an acceptable
computation time. Turbulence modelling is also still an area requiring
more research and development. Here, it is the 'k-epsilon' model
which is still the 'industry standard' for engineering calculations.
Despite the ever present need for more work, sufficient validation
has already been done such that, with experience and care, one
can have a good level of confidence in the quality of the results
<A HREF="#References" >[4] </A>. (Much analysis has taken place
in IEA ECBCS Annex 26 &quot;Air Flow in Large Enclosures&quot;
to evaluate the performance of CFD and to determine the conditions
under which it is applicable <A HREF="#References" >[5] </A>.)
<H2><A NAME="Examples">Examples</A></H2>

<P>
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show example results from three different types
of CFD simulations. The first simulation, <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1  
</A>, is of temperatures and flow patterns in a three-dimensional
model of a naturally ventilated shopping mall. The ventilation
system comprises low level openings with flow entering from the
left in the Figure and exiting at high level through the roof
exhaust stack. The outdoor temperature is 16 &#176;C. Occupancy,
lighting and solar gains elevate the temperature up to approximately
21 &#176;C at high level. Here, the CFD code used has predicted
the natural ventilation flow rate based on external wind pressures,
stack (buoyancy) effect and the resistance of the openings.<BR>

<P>
The second example, shown in <A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2 </A>,
represents flow in a laboratory space ventilated by laminar flow
panels in the ceiling. The exhaust air is taken through a fume
cupboard extract. The Figure shows speed contours, illustrating
the acceleration of flow into the fume cupboard and the wake-influence
due to the proximity of the operator. Both the room air distribution
and the fume cupboard containment effectiveness are being examined
here.
<P>
In the third simulation, <A HREF="#Figure3" >Figure 3 </A>, the
development of temperatures and smoke concentrations are predicted
in the atrium and occupied areas of a multi-floor office building.
Outdoor air enters the atrium at ground level and natural smoke
vents allow the smoke to escape at roof level. The temperature
stratification in the smoke layer can be seen. At ground level,
the volume of outside air entering the building maintains a clear
layer, and on the upper floors it is noticeable that floor supply
air diffusers (which remain in operation supplying fresh air)
are helping to minimise the full impact of the smoke temperatures.
From the information generated by CFD judgements can be made regarding
the safety and escape of occupants.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
Fortunately, much of the complexity of a user-friendly CFD code
is transparent to the user, who need not concern him/herself about
partial differential equations. What is important, though, is
that the user is able to properly describe the application to
be modelled, to ensure that the solution obtained satisfies certain
criteria regarding grid resolution and the consequent residual
errors in the solution, and then exercise engineering ability
in interpreting the results. An advantage of CFD is that, if necessary,
improvements can readily be made to the air distribution design
or smoke control system and the calculation re-run.
<P>
The question of cost-effectiveness is particularly important.
Historically, such computer codes have been too expensive and
too difficult to use to make a substantial impact in the buildings
and construction industry. Now, however, CFD software prices are
falling and performance and usability increasing such that acquiring
an in-house CFD capability or, indeed, commissioning external
CFD studies can be a realistic and relatively low-cost option
giving a substantial return in the quality of the project.
