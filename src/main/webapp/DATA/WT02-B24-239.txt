<A NAME="Intro">
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
</A>
  
     The graduate programs in economics at The University of Michigan
offer preparation for the wide range of careers now open to professional
economists in academic, business, and government sectors.  The
Department's faculty and graduates have long been involved in leading
developments in research and teaching and in governmental economic
policies.  The graduate programs are designed to continue this tradition,
by providing their students with rigorous analytical and practical
training.  <P>
     The Department offers two major programs, one leading to the Ph.D.
degree in Economics, the other leading to the Master of Arts degree in
Applied Economics (MAE).  <P>
     The Ph.D. program in Economics at Michigan has a long history and
many distinguished alumnae and alumni.  Designed primarily to train
professional economists, its emphasis is on the theoretical core of the
discipline, and its applications together with the essential research
skills.  In order to ensure that the quality of students is high and that
they have close contact with the faculty, new enrollment each year is
limited to about twenty-five entrants.  Most elective classes are small
and permit extensive class participation.  The sequence of core courses
provides an intensive basic preparation in the discipline, while advanced
courses, seminars, and research opportunities are offered in a wide
variety of specialized fields.  <P>
     The doctoral student will ordinarily devote the first two years to
coursework, independent reading, and preparation for the preliminary
examinations. The theory exams are normally completed by the end of the
first year or at the beginning of the second, and the applied field exams
by the end of the second year or at the beginning of the third.  The
remaining years are devoted primarily to the dissertation.  The time
required to write a dissertation varies so widely that it is difficult to
generalize about it.  For those who work part-time as teaching assistants,
it normally takes three to four years.  <P>
     The Master's program in Applied Economics, as the name implies, is a
policy-oriented program, with emphasis on the application of economic
tools and concepts to practical problems arising in a variety of fields. 
Enrollment is limited to about twenty new entrants each year.  Students in
this program ordinarily require one year to complete their work.  <P>
     The integrated programs of study and research described in this
brochure are designed to bring students into the mainstream of modern
economics by offering them the opportunity to work with leading scholars. 
The programs are also designed so as to provide substantial flexibility in
setting up a course of study fitted to the student's interests.  They
offer the student distinguished--in some cases, unique--resources in each
of many specialized fields and techniques.  <P>
     The Department also participates in a rich variety of
inter-departmental programs, including survey research, population
studies, natural resources, health economics, urban studies, law and
economics, social work and economics, and regional studies.  <P>
     All these programs naturally endeavor to develop high skills in
analysis, research, and expression.  But they aim also to encourage the
student's originality and independence of mind in seeking out and
contributing to economic issues of genuine significance. 
<P>

<A HREF="#Contents"><EM>(Back to Table of Contents...)</EM></A>
<P>

<H3>THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN ECONOMICS</H3>
 
     Admission is limited to students whose undergraduate record shows
genuine capacity for advanced work in the field of economics.  A full
economics major is not a prerequisite, but some previous training in
economics is essential (the intermediate level micro- and macroeconomic
theory courses are the most important).  Training in calculus, linear
algebra, and probability and statistics is also essential and grades
received in these courses are important factors in the admission decision. 
When appraising an applicant's scholarly promise, however, the faculty
looks not merely at the academic record but also at letters of
recommendation and the results of the Graduate Record Examination. 
Successful applicants will be those who appear strong by all these
criteria.  <P>
     The student can best prepare for graduate work in economics by taking
a broadly-based undergraduate program that includes liberal arts,
mathematics, and the natural and social sciences, rather than simply
accumulating credits in a large number of economics courses.  In
particular, prior work in advanced mathematics (especially calculus,
linear algebra, and mathematical statistics) can dramatically ease the
student's program during the first year and eliminate some required
courses. Because modern economics is highly quantitative, students without
sufficient mathematical preparation often have great difficulty completing
the program.  <P>
     In addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School,
students are expected to meet various departmental requirements.  These
are always under review and subject to revision.  The following paragraphs
summarize the present requirements. 
<P>
 
<A NAME="PhD1">
<H4>The First Year</H4>
</A> 

     A student's first year in the program is devoted to the core
curriculum.  A full course load would be: 

<PRE>  Fall Term                     Winter Term

  Econ 601 (micro theory)       Econ 603 (micro theory)
  Econ 602 (macro theory)       Econ 604 (macro theory) 
  Econ 653 (mathematics)        Econ 654 (mathematics) 
  Econ 673 (statistics)         Econ 674 (econometrics) 
</PRE> 

<P> Those
who are well prepared in mathematics or statistics may satisfy some or all
of the math and statistics requirements by passing equivalency exams. 
Some students may be advised to postpone one of these courses, typically
macroeconomics or statistics, until the second year.  For example,
first-year students holding teaching assistant positions normally take
three courses, as do foreign students who are required by the English
Language Institute to take supplementary courses in English.  <P>
     Preliminary exams are given each May and September in both
microeconomics and macroeconomics.  All students are required to pass each
exam within a year of completing the respective course.  In addition,
students who do not place out of the math and statistics courses must
receive a least a B- in each of these courses. 
 
<A NAME="PhD2">
<H4>The Second Year</H4>
</A>
 
     During the second year, since most students are teaching assistants,
the normal course load is three courses.  Most students complete any
remaining courses from the core curriculum during the second year, and
then take a two-course sequence in each of two "major" fields.  The
current list of available fields includes: Advanced Theory, Econometric
Theory, Industrial Organization, International Economics, Labor Economics,
Monetary Theory and Economic Stabilization, Population Studies, Public
Finance, and Transition Economics.  Other fields can be arranged on a case
by case basis.  Recent examples have been Health Economics, Finance, and
Natural Resource Economics.  Students must pass preliminary examinations
in their two major fields.  These exams are normally taken in May of a
student's second year or in September of a student's third year.  Both
exams must be passed by May of the fourth year.  <P>
     In addition to completing two "major" fields, each student must also
take one course in a "minor" field, chosen from the above list.  One of
the three fields chosen, the two "major" fields and the one "minor" field,
must be either Advanced Theory or Econometrics.  This requirement is
intended to insure that students are well versed in the particular
research techniques that they will use in writing their dissertations. 
Finally, students are required to take two "cognate" courses, which are
any courses (approved for graduate credit) in another department of the
University.  A wide variety of courses can be used to satisfy this
requirement.  Economics 673 counts as a cognate, satisfying one of the two
courses required.  Many students satisfy the requirement with a finance
course in the Graduate School of Business or a course in mathematics or
statistics.  Econ 775 (Stat 575) and Econ 776 (Stat 576) may be used to
satisfy this cognate requirement.  <P>
     The "minor" field requirement and the cognate requirement would
normally be completed by the end of the second year or the middle of the
third year, depending on a student's previous course load.  Courses used
to satisfy these requirements must be passed with grades of B- or better. 
<P>
     There is no general foreign language requirement for graduate
students in economics.  However, in individual cases where a student's
area of specialization or dissertation subject demands knowledge of
another language, the Department will encourage the student to acquire the
needed language skills.  <P>
 
<A NAME="PhD3">
<H4>Candidacy</H4>
</A>
 
     Once these course requirements and exams are completed, the student
has reached "candidacy," and is ready to begin work full time on economic
research for the dissertation.  <P>
     To help students make the transition from course work to research,
the Department requires that students complete a relatively short research
paper of "publishable" quality during the third year, under the
supervision of an appointed faculty member.  This paper normally starts
out as a paper written for a second-year course, and is then revised and
strengthened with the help of the faculty member.  Third-year students
meet regularly in a seminar with one of two faculty supervisors to discuss
research technique and to present results of their own research.  <P>
     Before receiving a Ph.D., each student is required to complete a
significant research project in order to satisfy the thesis requirement. 
Through writing a thesis, the student develops the capacity to conceive
and formulate a research topic, to bring knowledge and techniques from the
relevant fields to bear upon it, and to develop conclusions which advance
scholarly understanding.  Work on the dissertation also lays the
foundation for the student's own future research and professional
publications.  In many cases, the thesis will grow out of the third year
paper.  <P>
     Each student will be helped on the thesis by a research advisor, and
eventually by a committee of at least four faculty members.  As soon as is
feasible after the thesis committee has been selected, the student writes
and defends a formal dissertation proposal which describes the research
topic and the methods to be used in the analysis. Once the committee has
accepted the proposal, the student proceeds with the planned research. 
Throughout this period the student is expected to attend and take an
active part in the advanced seminar in the appropriate special field. 
When the dissertation is complete the student defends it in an oral
examination before the dissertation committee. 
 
<A NAME="PhD4">
<H4>Teaching and Research Assistantships</H4>
</A>
 
     Given the value of teaching and research in a student's training, the
Department requires the equivalent of one year of half-time experience in
a teaching or research assistant position.  Virtually all students would
do this even if it were not required.  In order to insure that teaching
and research assistant positions are available to as many students as
possible, the University also allows any one student to receive
college-funded teaching or research assistant positions for no more than
ten semesters.  <P>
     Most of the available teaching assistant positions are in the
principles courses and involve three hours in class per week.  The class
time is spent answering questions about the more difficult points covered
by the faculty in lecture that week and going over problem sets.  There
are also a few teaching assistant positions available in the upper-level
undergraduate and core graduate courses.  Some summer teaching assistant
positions are also available.  The Department also normally finances over
a dozen summer RA jobs for students following their first or second year
in the program.  These positions provide students substantial research
experience early in their program and help them establish a close working
relationship with some faculty member.  Individual faculty members finance
other RA positions, as do various research organizations on campus
including the 
<A HREF="http://www.isr.umich.edu/>
Institute for Social Research</A>, the 
<A HREF="http://mqem.econ.lsa.umich.edu/">
Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics</A>, and the 
<A HREF="http://www.bus.umich.edu/resource/otp/tax.html">
Office of Tax Policy Research</A>.  <P>

<A NAME="PhD5">
<H4>Financial Support</H4>
</A>
 
     The Department provides several types of financial aid to its Ph.D.
students.  Entering students are automatically considered for financial
aid unless they indicate they have support from elsewhere.  <P>
     <EM>Teaching assistant positions</EM>:  All continuing students making
satisfactory progress should be able to obtain a teaching assistant
position.  In addition, about a quarter of the students in the first-year
class are offered teaching assistant positions, generally in the
principles courses.  All students are required to take the Department's TA 
training course before becoming a TA for the first time.  In addition, all 
international students must demonstrate proficiency in the English 
language in an oral examination, and must successfully complete a 
three-week course in teaching techniques offered each May and August, 
to qualify for a teaching assistant position. 
Teaching assistantships entitle the student to a tuition waiver, and a
salary which depends on the time commitment required for the position. 
During 1995-96, a teaching assistant position in the principles course
required seventeen hours per week and paid a salary of $4041 per semester, 
plus health insurance. 
<P>
     <EM>Fellowships</EM>:  Entering American students with a strong
undergraduate grade point average and high GRE scores are eligible for the
University's Regents Fellowship.  This fellowship provides a tuition
waiver and a generous stipend for the first two years of the student's
graduate program, plus a guarantee of a teaching assistant position during
the following two years, subject to the usual stipulation that the student
be making satisfactory progress towards the degree.  <P>
     In addition, there are a variety of <A HREF="grad/fellowships.html">
other fellowships</A> available with
the Department and the University.  Qualified minority students are
eligible for generous support.  A number of fellowships exist for students
interested in area studies (Chinese, Russian and East European, Near
Eastern and North African, South and Southeast Asian studies).  To be
eligible for these fellowships, a separate application must be submitted
to the relevant Area Center before February 1 for the coming academic
year.  Information and application forms may be obtained by writing to the
appropriate Area Center at Lane Hall, University of Michigan.  In
addition, the Department maintains a number of attractive fellowships for
the study of the Japanese economy.  Students seeking support for graduate
study of the Japanese economy should contact the Department's Japan
Economy Program directly.  Students expressing an interest in demography
may be eligible for multi-year traineeships which are offered through the
Population Studies Center.  <P>
     Each year about half a dozen of our students who have reached
candidacy receive University fellowships, allowing them to work full time
on their dissertation.  Further information about these fellowships is
available from the Department.  <P>
     Finally, the Department has limited funds to provide tuition waivers
or small fellowships to entering students in appropriate circumstances. 
<P>
     Of course, financial aid is also available outside the University,
through the National Science Foundation, the CIC minority fellowships
program, the Sloan Foundation, and through other sources.  <P>
     <EM>Loans</EM>: Loan funds may be available through the University 
to aid students who are otherwise unable to continue their graduate work.
Students may also participate in the loan program of the National Defense
Education Act of 1958.  For information, contact the Office of Financial
Aid, Student Activities Building, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,
48109.  <P>
     <EM>Prizes</EM>: The John E. Parker Prize (currently $500) is awarded
for an outstanding written contribution in the area of labor economics or
human resources.  This prize is usually awarded annually.  In addition,
the Robert Roosa Fellowship is awarded every few years to support
dissertation research in the area of monetary economics.  <P>
 
<A NAME="PhD6">
<H4>Professional Placement</H4>
</A>
 
     The Department actively assists its graduating doctoral students to
obtain professional positions with universities and colleges, research
institutions, government and international agencies, and business firms. 
This assistance is provided routinely by those faculty members who have
worked most closely with the students, as well as by a single faculty
member who, as Placement Officer of the Department, assists all doctoral
students seeking jobs.  Administrative costs of placement assistance are
covered in part by a charge to those using the service.  The demand for
well-trained graduates in economics continues to be strong in the private
and government sectors.  About two-thirds of our graduates end up in
academic positions.  The rest find attractive jobs in international
organizations, the government sector, consulting firms, or occasionally
elsewhere in the private sector.  Unlike graduates of many traditional
Ph.D. disciplines, trained graduate economists continue to be in high
demand.<P>
 
     The placement of doctoral students over the past five years
(1990-1994) is summarized below: 
 
<PRE>    Type of Institution                      Number 
 
    Nationally ranked universities 1-20        10
    Other research universities                19
    Liberal arts colleges                       9
    Government and nonprofit organizations     13
    Private industry and consulting firms       3
</PRE> 

<A NAME="PhD7">
<H4>The Master of Arts (MA) Degree in Economics</H4>
</A>
 
     Except in special circumstances, applicants who seek only a Master's
Degree will be considered solely for the Master's Degree in Applied
Economics (MAE), which is described below.  The MA Degree in Economics is
instead ordinarily earned by students in the Ph.D. program upon successful
completion of a portion of their course work.  Some students who are
initially admitted to the Ph.D. program may eventually choose to complete
only the requirements for the MA degree, while successful doctoral
students earn the degree as a matter of course. <P>
     Specific course requirements for the MA degree include two core
theory courses, usually Economics 601 and 602 (with an average grade of B
or better), plus appropriate training in statistics and mathematics, two
applied field courses, and two cognate courses.  Alternative courses can
be substituted with the approval of the Graduate Director.  <P>

<A NAME="PhD8">
<H4>Procedures for Application</H4>
</A>
 
<!--     Applications for admission to the Ph.D. program (which automatically
includes application for financial support) should be addressed to : The
Mail Room, Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, Michigan, 48109.  
-->
<B>APPLICATIONS FOR FALL ADMISSION MUST BE RECEIVED
BY JANUARY 15 OF THAT YEAR</B>.  There is no separate application form for
financial aid.  Entrance in the Winter or Spring-Summer Terms is approved
only in highly unusual cases.  <P>
     <B>All</B> applicants must take the general aptitude Graduate Record
Examination and must provide three letters of recommendation from
undergraduate teachers or others in a position to evaluate the applicants'
potential for graduate study.  <P>
     Admission and fellowship awards are usually announced by March 15,
and students are asked to indicate their acceptance of fellowship offers
by April 15.  An enrollment deposit of $200 (non-refundable) applicable to
first-term fees is made at this point by students who choose to enter the
program. 
<P>
 
<A NAME="PhD9">
<H4>International Students</H4>
</A>

     The Department welcomes applications from talented, fully-prepared
inernational students.  Applicants whose native language is not English 
are required to take an English Language Test in their country as part of 
the process of admission.  The Graduate School will supply information
regarding the arrangements for taking the test.  Fluency in English is
essential to success in the graduate program.  Applicants will be admitted
to the Graduate School only if their scores in the test are sufficiently
high.  Those with clear fluency in English, as confirmed by an oral
presentation, will be eligible for teaching assistant positions.  Courses
on English as a foreign language are available on campus for students who
do need further training in English.  <P>
     International applicants face a special difficulty in gaining admission in
that members of the Department are rarely well-qualified to judge the
academic credentials of students from foreign universities.  Accordingly,
applicants from universities outside the United States are reminded of the
necessity of taking, through a U.S. embassy or consulate, the Graduate
Record Examination (of verbal, mathematical, and analytical achievement)
offered by the Educational Testing Service.  Further, it is particularly
useful to include information about rank in class and to have letters of 
recommendation are written by professors who
understand U.S. graduate schools and their requirements.  <P>
     All international students who come to the University of Michigan on
student visas must certify sufficient funds to support themselves and
their dependents, if any, while here.  The International Admissions Office
of the Graduate School will provide each foreign applicant with a precise
statement of the amount of support that must be certified.  <P>
     International students wanting to study in the United States have at times
been able to secure financial aid through programs administered by the
Office of Cultural Affairs of the American Embassy.  Students who want
more information should contact that office, stating their need for
financial assistance.  <P>

<A NAME="MAE">
<H3>THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS IN APPLIED ECONOMICS (MAE)</H3>
</A>
 
     This degree program is designed for students who wish to apply the
theory and techniques of economics to the analysis of practical problems
in a variety of fields.  Unlike the Master of Arts Degree in Economics,
the MAE is <B>NOT</B> an intermediate step to the Ph.D.  (However, 
students in the program may, of course, apply to the Ph.D. program.) <P>
     The MAE program addresses itself to the needs of three kinds of
students: (1) those who want advanced training in economics in order to
qualify for jobs in government or private organizations that require
greater expertise than is provided by an undergraduate degree, (2) those
who wish to study economics as a complement to their work in another
field, and (3) those who need further background in economics, math, or
statistics, or who need to certify their ability to do graduate work in
economics, in order to gain admission to a Ph.D. program.  For the second
group, dual programs, including in some cases dual degrees, can combine
economics with public health, social work, law, natural resources,
demography, industrial relations, statistics, business administration, and
other fields.  <P>
     Applicants to this program should have completed intermediate micro-
and macroeconomic theory courses as well as courses in calculus and
introductory statistics.  <P>
     The degree is earned in a minimum of three terms and requires 33
hours of graduate course work.  The course sequence for the degree
normally includes two core theory courses, usually Economics 501 and 
502, three courses covering some aspect of quantitative methods used in
economics, usually including Economics 553 and 571, three courses in 
two different applied fields in economics, and three courses in related 
fields of the student's choosing.  The student's overall program is chosen 
in consultation with the Director of the MAE program.  <P>
     No thesis is required and there are no examinations other than the
course examinations.  <P>
     <B>APPLICATIONS FOR SPRING ADMISSION TO THE MAE PROGRAM 
MUST BE RECEIVED BY MARCH 1 OF THAT YEAR</B>.  
Funds for direct support of MAE students are severely limited.  
<!-- Applications for admission should be addressed to:  The
Mail Room, Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan, Ann

     <B>All</B> applicants must take the general aptitude Graduate Record
Examination and provide three letters of recommendation from undergraduate
teachers or others in a position to evaluate the applicant's potential for

<H3>EXPENSES</H3>
</A>
 
     For 1995-96, tuition was $4,519 per term for Michigan residents and
$9,099 for non-residents.  See the Regulations of Horace H. Rackham School
of Graduate Studies for more information regarding fees, as well as a
description of the rules concerning residency.  After the doctoral student
completes all necessary coursework and examinations and is advanced to
candidacy, tuition is reduced to $2,866 per term (1995-96 rates) for both
residents and non-residents.  Living costs are comparable to those at
other ranking universities.  A variety of university and other housing is
available to single and married students.  Information on this subject can
be obtained by writing the Housing Office, 1500 Student Activities
Building, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109. <P>
