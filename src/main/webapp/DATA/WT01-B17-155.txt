<b><i>A close call with breast cancer showed these stars from L.A. Law the need to be informed about medical alternatives. Today, they argue the case that alternative medicine keeps them healthy.</i></b><br>
<p>

<img src="images/berry.gif" alt="" border="1" width="150" height="150" align="right">


Ten years ago, Jill Eikenberry, co-star of the long-running TV show, L.A. Law, learned she had breast cancer. She might have been the well-briefed activist counselor Ann Kelsey on TV, but in real life Jill had no idea that alternative medicine could help her, that there were any alternative treatments, or that women could survive breast cancer, even after a mastectomy or radiation.<p>
Today, Jill devotes her free time, when she's not starring in a new film, play, or TV show, to telling recently diagnosed women that there is life after breast cancer. In fact, as Jill, now 49, has discovered, life can be vibrant, full of self-discovery and constantly improving health. "I've never felt better in my life than now. I have enormous vitality and joy, every day."
Jill and husband Michael Tucker—another L.A. Law co-star, playing Stuart Markowitz, a kind-hearted lawyer amidst the cutthroats of office and courtroom politics—speak to audiences at hospitals, to breast cancer support groups, to anybody who wants to learn how cancer can be a positive turning point in life. Along the way, Jill and Michael, 51, talk enthusiastically about how acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, chiropractic, and massage have helped them end long-standing health problems and keep them in top form. <p>

<b>A STRANGER HELPS JILL SAVE HER BREAST</b><br>

Jill's breast cancer couldn't have come at a worse time. She was 39 and on the verge of almost guaranteed stardom. As it turned out, L.A. Law ran on Thursday nights on NBC for 8 years, until 1994; Michael received 3 Emmy nominations, and Jill won a Golden Globe. She and Michael had completed the L.A. Law pilot, and had a few weeks to rest up before beginning the fall season's filming in earnest. Instead of relaxing, they would be entering the most stressful period of their lives—dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis.<p>
In 1986, neither Jill nor Michael were familiar with alternative medicine or what it could do for cancer. "I wish I had been," Jill admits today. "I was not informed and was terrified and didn't do things right." Almost immediately, the first doctor she consulted told her to have her breast removed, a surgical procedure called a mastectomy. "That's what he did the most frequently, so I said okay, take it off—whatever you have to do," Jill says. "I simply didn't know anybody who had survived breast cancer. I also didn't have the courage then to ask the right questions."<p>
But Jill got lucky. She and Michael were at the screening of a new film in which she starred. A young woman from the cast approached Jill, studied her face, and asked her, point blank, what had happened. Even though Jill and Michael had resolved to keep the diagnosis confidential (as it could have jeopardized her career), Jill was evidently wearing the emotional impact of it on her face. <p>
     Forgetting her resolve to keep it a secret, Jill told her co-actor everything. The young woman then introduced Jill to her mother who, after hearing the story, took Jill into the ladies' room. The mother abruptly hiked up her blouse and showed Jill a little scar on her right breast. "That's all I have left to remind me of my breast cancer 11 years ago," she said. That little scar on the woman's intact breast came as a revelation for Jill. "It was the first time it occurred to me that I might survive." <p>
The experience in the ladies' room was a turning point. It helped Jill find the courage to get a second medical opinion. The second doctor said she would be better served by a lumpectomy, which would entail the removal of only the tumor. Jill had radiation therapy and the lumpectomy, and saved her breast.<p>

<b>BRIMMING WITH NEW LIFE, OPEN TO CHANGE</b><br>

Overall, it was a frightening experience, says Jill, but the worst part was not knowing what her medical options were and not having a support group beyond husband Michael. But being a woman of strength, Jill turned all that around in 3 years. In 1989, she coproduced and hosted an NBC documentary called Destined to Live. <p>
The film featured interviews with breast cancer survivors, including former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and how they coped with the emotional trauma of a life-threatening illness. "We made the documentary to show women with breast cancer that they are not alone."<p>
It was this face-to-face confrontation with her own mortality—the fear that she could die from breast cancer—that helped Jill make major changes in her life. <p>
"Having breast cancer absolutely was a catalyst for me—for both of us—to get onto a new path," Jill explains."The wonderful thing about interviewing the women was that we saw how many of them felt that, ultimately, the cancer experience had been good for them, that it had been a wake-up call, that they had used it to turn their lives around and start doing what they really wanted to. Breast cancer survivors are wonderful to speak to because they've seen their mortality and are so open to change."
Jill was no exception. In her case, life after breast cancer was "an extraordinarily fulfilling life." Working with mind-body expert (and endocrinologist) Deepak Chopra, M.D., Jill began to understand how women can store emotional pain in their breasts and genitals. <p>
Another way of saying this is that many of the unresolved emotions women are carrying around relate to their sexuality and their experiences as a woman. It's important to release these blockages and "open up all the places that women tend to hold a lot of their frustration, anger, tensions, and past abuses—everything to do with our sexuality," says Jill. Then the energy can flow freely again through the mind and body. <p>
Women of her age, as they edge into menopause, often despondently assume that life as a woman in her 50s means a dampened sexuality and diminished libido. After measuring her hormones levels, Jill's gynecologist expected Jill's sexual drive to be "completely gone," but the opposite was true instead. "Frankly, I've never had more libido. I've never felt more vital and alive, more sensually and sexually in my body." <p>

<b>ACUPUNCTURE FINe-TUNES THEIR HEALTH</b><br>
Since their introduction to serious illness and the elements of healing, Jill and Michael both have benefited from alternative medicine. For Michael, it was stress reduction. <p>
As Jill's sole support team during the breast cancer ordeal and as an actor with a demanding schedule, Michael developed a great deal of stress. This raised his cholesterol level to 240, a dangerous level according to conventional medicine. Using only the stress reduction techniques he learned from Deepak Chopra, M.D., over a 12-month period, Michael was able to relax enough to help produce a dramatic drop in his cholesterol, down to 196. But next came shoulder pain.<p>
A few years ago, Jill and Michael left Southern California and bought a house in Mill Valley, a pleasant, upmarket town amidst the redwoods near the San Francisco Bay. Michael began to have trouble getting full range of motion in his shoulder without considerable pain. A medical examination by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed that he had a water cyst impinging on a nerve.<p>
Michael's orthopedic surgeon then did something unusual for a conventional doctor: He recommended that he see Ira J. Golchehreh, O.M.D., L.Ac.,  an acupuncturist in nearby San Rafael. Over the course of 6 weeks, Dr. Golchehreh treated Michael with acupuncture and herbs twice weekly. "It's been totally successful," says Michael, who no longer has any shoulder pain. <p>
Seeing an acupuncturist was not new to Michael; he had consulted one regularly in Los Angeles for years. The relief from the shoulder pain convinced him of the preventive benefits of alternative medicine. "Now I go often for acupuncture and herbs for general balancing and well-being." <p>
His experience with alternative medicine has also shown him what holism means."You have to tie it all together. If your emotional life is good and you're happy, then you've a better chance of staying healthy."<p>
Since her recovery from breast cancer, Jill has also used acupuncture as a way of fine-tuning her system. She had a chronic problem with her stomach including digestive difficulties and colon discomfort—most likely an ulcer in its early stages, she says. Like Michael, Jill had consulted an acupuncturist while they lived in Los Angeles. He gave her nutritional supplements, regular acupuncture treatments, and dietary advice, such as eating only warm, cooked foods. She had excellent results and her stomach problems faded away until the stress of moving brought them back.<p>
Once relocated in Mill Valley, Jill followed Michael to Dr. Golchehreh who used acupuncture and herbs to boost Jill's liver energy and overall digestive vitality. "I swear by acupuncture. It's about getting the energy flowing, and Dr. Golchehreh is brilliant at this."<p>
Regular contact with acupuncturists over the years also introduced Jill to the benefits of homeopathy, especially as a safe and effective first-aid measure. "I am mostly drug-free and use homeopathic remedies for whatever comes up, such as a rash or fever. When we're worried about getting a cold, we use Chinese herbs."<p>
As appropriate, Jill and Michael rely on massage, chiropractic, and special breathing techniques. Now that they have known serious illness and exultant healing from the inside, they'll never lose sight of what makes both happen. Emotions can make or break your health; and sexuality, depending on whether it's open or blocked, can also shift the picture one way or another. For them, love and intimacy, expressed in both domains, can be a healing force, too.<p>
It's not surprising to find the "Tuckerberrys"—their whimsical term for themselves as a couple— taking a little time off from TV shows and films to star in a new production of the classic two-part play, Love Letters, celebrating the lifelong friendship of two characters as expressed through their letters. 	
It's another way of taking their message on the road, telling people that healing is possible and that personal growth is a lifetime project. And while on the road, not forgetting their L.A. Law roots, Jill and Michael won't hesitate to argue the case for alternative medicine. "We don't give any prescriptions," says Jill. "We just tell our story." <p>
