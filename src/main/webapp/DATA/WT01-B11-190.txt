<B>Ontario Plans to Continue Raccoon Vaccination Program


</B>

</CENTER><P>
MNR will vaccinate raccoons again this year along the Niagara River and in an area along the St. Lawrence River to prevent raccoon rabies from entering Ontario.<P>

The trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program is scheduled to take place between June and November this year.  Under the two TVR programs, raccoons will be trapped, vaccinated and released within a 680-square-kilometre area between the Welland Canal and the Niagara River, and along an area 3 to 10 kilometres deep on the St. Lawrence River.<P>

"Trained MNR staff will conduct the TVR programs by setting up live traps," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "Captured raccoons, skunks and foxes will be tagged for identification, vaccinated by injection with rabies vaccine, then released.  Ministry staff will check the traps every morning."<P>
	
MNR is asking the public to leave the traps alone, especially if they contain animals.<P>

To date, there are no confirmed cases of raccoon rabies in Ontario.  However, raccoon rabies has been reported in New York State, along the banks of the Niagara River, and within 
10 kilometres of the St. Lawrence River in an area across from Gananoque.<P>

This will be the third year for the TVR program in the Niagara area.  During the 1995 season, MNR captured 75 per cent of the raccoon population in that area.  It is the second year for the TVR program in the St. Lawrence region, which has also been identified as a likely entry point for raccoon rabies.<P> 

For the second year, a study which involves testing blood samples from a number of wild raccoons for signs of certain viruses, will be conducted in the TVR areas of the St. Lawrence and the whole Niagara Peninsula.  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada requires that this study be done before any consideration can be given to using oral rabies vaccines for raccoons.  Oral vaccine is currently being tested in the United States as an approach to preventing rabies in raccoons and other wildlife.<P>

Contingency plans have been developed by MNR and its partners on the province's Raccoon Rabies Task Force should raccoon rabies be reported in areas other than those with TVR programs.  A provincial contingency plan is also in place if raccoon rabies should enter Ontario.<P>

As well, the Ministry of Natural Resources is continuing its work on eliminating fox rabies in Ontario this year.  Since 1989, aerial baiting programs have taken place throughout the province and, by 2001, MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies from Ontario.<P>

A rabies hotline with two toll-free numbers is available to the public for direct and immediate access to information on rabies.<P>
