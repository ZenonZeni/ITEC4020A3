<H2>Phantom ships: piracy's
newest twist in Asia</H2></CENTER>
    According to the Commercial Crime Services Division of the International Chamber of Commerce, based in Britain,the traditional form of piracy, in which raiders board vessels on the high seas to plunder their cargo, is on the decline worldwide. While the figures are subject to seasonal variations, in part due to the vaguaries of weather, the 1994 total number of incidents was under 100 worldwide, compared with about 150 in 1993.  The 1995 totals are expected to reflect this continuing trend. However, a new form of highjacking is emerging. Operators of phantom ships, so called because they sail under carefully faked documents, are stealing upwards of $200 million in cargo every year from East Asian docks and taking it to other ports to be sold to customers who are either unaware the goods were stolen or unlikely to question the shipment's origin or ownership. <P>
    According to the International Maritime Bureau, which has investigated 20 phantom ships in recent years, the problem has become a serious headache for insurance carriers. Typically, the vessels are registered in Panama or Honduras and operated by groups of Chinese working out of Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, and Singapore. They are very familiar with documentation and shipping and usually target generic cargos that can be easily sold: wire cable, timber, minerals. <P>
    At this juncture law enforcement agencies have urged the countries under whose flags these phantom ships sail to yank the vessels' registraton, but so far none have. In the meantime, no other strategies to combat the menace have been devised. <P>
