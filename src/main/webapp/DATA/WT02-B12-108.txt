&gt;In article &lt;199402232157.QAA26990@eff.org&gt;, mech@eff.org (Stanton McCandlish)
&gt;writes, quoting NIST:
&gt;
&gt;|&gt;                    They found that the algorithm provides
&gt;|&gt; significant protection and that it will be 36 years until the cost
&gt;|&gt; of breaking the EES algorithm will be equal to the cost of breaking
&gt;|&gt; the current Data Encryption Standard. <p>

&gt;  This is meaningless.  Could someone please make a more meaningful
&gt;comparison of EES with Triple DES or IDEA?  DES is clearly out of date.
&gt;Oh, I forgot, we're not allowed to see the EES. :-) <p>

You don't need to see EES for this "expert computation". <p>

Processor speeds double every 1.5 years (thanks to chip technology
improvements -- also affecting speed of Wiener's chips). <p>

Brute force attack of Clipper's 80-bit keys takes 2^(80-56) times as
many trials.  If you want to wait until chip technology makes that as
fast as current DES breaking, you need to wait  (80-56)*1.5 years. <p>

Triple DES (of the form ECB|ECB|ECB) with three independent keys has
3*56 bits of key and it will take (3*56-80)*1.5 years before you can
break triple-DES in the same time you break Clipper today. <p>

IDEA has a 128-bit key, so it will take (128-80)*1.5 years before
you can break IDEA in the same time as you could break Clipper today. <p>

If you want brute force protection, of course, you can use my <p>

DES|TRAN|nDES|TRAN|DES          (call it DTnDTD) <p>

suggestion from a day or two ago (on sci.crypt) and get ((n+2)*56-80)*1.5
years lead on Clipper -- practical for n up to about 500, given today's
message sizes. <p>

Summary: <p>

to break X in the same time (cost) as breaking Clipper today,
        you need to wait: <p>

X               time <p>

DES             - 36 years
        IDEA            72 years
        triple-DES      132 years
        (DTnDTD, n=16)  1392 years <p>

Meanwhile, I would *far* prefer single DES over Clipper, to protect against
organized crime attacks on my privacy.  I don't believe OrgCrime would be
able to build a Wiener machine (or better) and get known plaintext from my
traffic without a huge ramp-up time in staffing and research -- but
stealing keys, bribing escrow agents, etc., is something OrgCrime is
already very skilled at. <p>
