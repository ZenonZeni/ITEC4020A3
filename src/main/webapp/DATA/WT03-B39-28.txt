TORIES BRACED FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: SENIOR MINISTERS ADMIT MAJOR MAY
LOSE COMMONS MAJORITY BEFORE END OF 1996

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Government ministers yesterday contemplated the probability that Mr
John Major will lead a minority administration later this year, amid
fears that the Conservatives can expect to lose more seats in the House
of Commons.

As left and rightwing Tories indulged in mutual recriminations over the
recent defection of Miss Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West and
Torridge, to the Liberal Democrats, senior ministers privately admitted
that the government could expect to lose its Commons majority before
the end of 1996 - and that it may rely for survival on the support of
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.

Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at least
six other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yet
several admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs would
put the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of Miss
Nicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-elections
to cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, who
remains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.

However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely on
their support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' for
the UUP.

'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason of
events in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio
4's Today programme.

Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need for
concessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relations
with the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government's
fortunes.

Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs that
the delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to be
tottering in the wake of the defection.

Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack on
Miss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defection
had been the party's shift to the right.

'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - that
is completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party is
probably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within the
party.'

Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, also
attacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming Mr
Major's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.

However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on Mr
Portillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stance
and that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is no
doubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'That
can't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is a
false denial.'

Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded a
halt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson and
called on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party's
wings.

'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visible
for all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappiness
produced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot afford
any more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said.

TAX SELF-ASSESSMENT WILL HIT SMALL BUSINESS, SAYS LABOUR

   By JAMES BLITZ

The Treasury's plan to allow self-employed managers of small businesses
to assess their own income tax liabilities will come under a strong
attack from the Labour party this week amid claims that it will add
significantly to company costs.

Labour claims self-assessment will place new burdens on small
businesses running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It estimates
the scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds
250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increases
in red tape.

Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned the
scheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday the
introduction of self-assessment later this year would increase the
Treasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.

Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commons
on Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.

Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because the
self-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis of
current-year activities rather than those for the previous year.

Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, the
change to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take more
in tax from the self-employed.

'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way the
government is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'
said Mr Smith.

He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to be
delayed to avoid confusion.

But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon the
self-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create new
difficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.

A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government would
receive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a
'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.

'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with more
definite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'
he said.

WALDEGRAVE GETS TOUGH ON SPENDING TO FINANCE TAX CUTS

   By ROBERT PESTON, Political Editor

Remorseless pressure to bring down public spending to finance next
year's widely expected tax cuts has been promised by Mr William
Waldegrave, chief secretary to the Treasury, in a new year interview.

The chief secretary said he had a long-term aim of seeing public
spending fall to around 35 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
with about 42 per cent at present.

He said this should not be seen 'against the background of a slavish
target of numbers' but because of a 'genuine belief that too much is
done (by government) and a good deal of it is act-ually hindering the
economy'.

His views on the potential for shrinking the government's share of the
economy are strikingly different from those of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who is not persuaded that there is scope to get the
proportion much below 40 per cent of GDP without damaging public
services.

There is also a significant difference between Mr Waldegrave and Mr
Clarke on European monetary union. Mr Clarke believes that the decision
to participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.
However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an act
of political will and choice'.

He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade the
EU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only a
small minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - is
motivated by a desire to delay the project.

'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions which
will be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' Mr
Waldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will be
quite considerable.'

The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest any
criticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales to Iraq, due to
be published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of the report
criticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Office minister in
the late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in the government's
policy on the arms embargo with Iraq.

Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,
said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only consider
resigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the whole
business is so wrong'.

He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault but
that of 'the whole Foreign Office'.

On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would start
visiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.

One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn cost
to government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries and
quangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred million
pounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure on
spending departments to substitute private finance for
government-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flow
there is probably more to come from that,' he said.

His other target will be to step up the government's fight against
fraud, especially in the social security budget.

AILING KING FAHD HANDS OVER POWER TO SAUDI PRINCE: MOVE ENDS
SPECULATION OVER SUCCESSION BUT FUELS DOUBT ON RULER'S HEALTH

   By ROULA KHALAF, Middle East Correspondent

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd handed over the running of the government
yesterday to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, in a development
likely to raise further doubts about the king's health but end
speculation about succession in the kingdom.

A royal order carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the
73-year-old monarch, who is believed to have suffered a minor stroke
last November, was handing over 'management of government affairs' to
the crown prince while he recuperates.

Prince Abdullah, who is two years younger than the king, is deputy
prime minister and head of the powerful 57,000-man National Guard. He
is seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than the
king, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom's
foreign and economic policies.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter and a close ally of
the US. The decree said the prince would take over while the king
enjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.

The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the king
fell ill.

Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and represent
the king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king's
health improves, diplomats said yesterday.

'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said one
diplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know is
how much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'

The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what was
officially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been a
stroke.

Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterday
aided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah and
Prince Sultan, the defence minister.

Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting an
end to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.

The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The first
was the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 which
destroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre in
Riyadh, the capital.

Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to these
events from their base in London and claimed a power struggle has
broken out in the royal family.

They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt to
undermine Crown Prince Abdullah.

Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.
Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sector
retrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Pounds 25.8bn), the
same as in 1995.

Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices and
the cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarked
on a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oil
revenues.

CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS

   By ANDREW JACK

   PARIS


Mr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with the
practice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night by
raising the political content of the country's traditional New Year's
Eve address from its head of state.

In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on most
television news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time to
defending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied in
to his election campaign promises.

He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and global
importance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance and
justice.

Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, which
was prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, he
called the resulting period one of 'crisis'.

In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praised
the 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as the
rest of the government.

However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to be
drawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue and
consultation - something which he acknowledged had not been
characteristic of France in the past.

Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'it
is no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' with
only piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to cope
with 'global competition'.

He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,
unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduce
unemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.

He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview last
October on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up a
creative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risen
since his election - would be cut as soon as possible.

President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -
a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his own
country on the wall behind him.

However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration of
the EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of the
French, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' of
employment.

SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME


President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's political
parties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government of
Mr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the life
of the current parliament.

The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual message
delivered on New Year's eve.

The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week's
meeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debate
on the future of the government following the resignation tendered last
Saturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.

As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insisting
parliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforced
this point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies will
provide the right opportunity to know precisely what the various
political groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that is
both clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'

The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time for
the political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none of
the main political parties has come forward with a proposal either for
the continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.

But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,
appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.
Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the country
cannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy's
six-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.

Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughout
President Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man who
intended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He made
his own preferences plain.

He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -
so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bank
of Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also said
he would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reform
of the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50th
anniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtle
hint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutional
reform has been tackled.

Yesterday several political parties took exception to what they
regarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particular
the president's message was attacked by the rightwing National
Alliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which was
formed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.

SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE

   By PETER WISE

   LISBON


Campaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 began
this week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing a
clear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 years
until his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October's
general election.

Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayor
of Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of the
vote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for Mr
Cavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recent
interviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.

Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistently
elected presidents from the party opposed to the government so that
each acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says that
Portugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to the
Socialists, who are also dominant in local government.

However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provide
additional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of a
parliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-
presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolve
parliament and call an early election when governments run into
difficulties.

Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backing
of a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meet
election commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercise
the budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets for
European economic and monetary union.

Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity to
dismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledged
to co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.

The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloof
decision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance and
concern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, has
made popular is proving difficult to achieve.

Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, a
less charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of his
rival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before its
defeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.

The government is avoiding decisive measures, including the
presentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. It
hopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can be
prolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.

RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY

   By JOHN THORNHILL

   MOSCOW


Russia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue to
pursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and
cut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite the
strong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary
elections.

However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economic
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employed
by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's
Eve.

'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poor
should begin to live better,' he said, promising the government would
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has
caused great social distress.

Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles which
was responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.

Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing
rhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' who
were responsible for undermining the reform programme.

He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them for
savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.

Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up
inflation early this year. The government may come under intense
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral
favour before the presidential election in June.

But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradiction
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.

PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

Political decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.

No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the first
move. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding the
fate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they have
had ample notice of the administration's limited duration.

Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996
budget. This was his last self-appointed task.

President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliament
to decide what should happen next. This will take the form of a
parliamentary debate later this week or early next week.

Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini is
more than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has the
final say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxious
the former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain in
office.

President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-up
now that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of the
presidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain prime
minister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of the
six-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategy
by Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allow
parliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for a
recreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italian
politics until 1992.

The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:

Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency and
permit elections around June.

Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held in
late February or early March.

A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permit a
programme of big institutional reforms.

The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dini
could seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headed
by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his government
of non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragile
majority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached with
the rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime
minister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, while
the parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.

Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could try
to broaden the backing for the government to include the small centre
parties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage of
lessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's main
backer and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through a
few reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset the
destabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, with
almost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.

The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament being
dissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Dini
would remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that it
normally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a government
after an election, Italy would be without an effective administration
probably until May.

The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require a
commitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of Mr
Berlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out over
the next two years important institutional reforms such as
strengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplication
of the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a
'technical' government to continue as the executive while a special
bicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a new
government would be formed, drawing ministers from the parties
supporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up the
reforms.

Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based government
over the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month for
corruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS is
sceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), his
main ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves are
changing too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.

The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continue
backing Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, has
dropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because the
PDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and beset
by doubts about being led in an election by the uncharismatic Mr Romano
Prodi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holding
company.

The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with a
movement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.
But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because of
his own problems with the law that have arisen as a result of
investigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milan
magistrates' anti-corruption team.

Against this background, the simplest option for the political parties
is to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs an
identifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is a
convenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide their
confusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at the
ballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, even
if Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of the
system.

PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS

   By GUY DE JONQUIERES

   LONDON


Public procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a year
will be thrown open to international competition under a World Trade
Organisation agreement which took effect yesterday.

The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to a
wider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago.

In addition to covering services for the first time, the new rules
extend to procurement by sub-central purchasers, such as states,
provinces, departments and utilities, as well as to central
governments.

Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,
it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, the
European Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.
Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.

The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regional
and urban public transport sector.

The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated in
Special Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened to
competition. The threshold for central government procurement is
SDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers about
SDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.

The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensure
that foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on the
same basis as those in the purchaser's home country.

GENE CLONING RAISES HOPES

   By DANIEL GREEN

   LONDON


A gene that has been linked with obesity has been cloned, a step that
brings closer a new generation of treatments for the chronically
overweight.

Two companies, Millennium of the US and Roche of Switzerland, describe
the cloning - effectively the manufacture - of the 'ob' gene in the
latest issue of the journal Cell.

The ob gene triggers the manufacture of a protein, leptin, which last
year was been shown to affect the weight of mice with no significant
side effects. But the relationship between leptin and weight in humans
has not yet been established precisely.

The two companies claim to have narrowed research to the gene's
activity in the brain, but further work is probably needed before
development of an obesity drug based on the ob gene could start.

Last year, the US biotechnology company Amgen paid Dollars 20m for to
the Rockefeller Institute in New York, which first identified the gene,
for the rights to products arising from it.

EUROPEAN PRESS REVIEW: BEACON FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACY - RUSSIA

   By JOHN THORNHILL

Democracy can be a baffling business. In Soviet times, Russia's voters
could vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fed
to them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had a
choice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer to
Russia's woes.

Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russians
bewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them opted
for the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But the
elections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders who
are now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-important
presidential elections scheduled in six months' time.

The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrial
town founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulated
many of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate the
campaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain and
ideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.

The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Soviet
emblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,
provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,
encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in the
development of a healthy civil society.

Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker could
have been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of six
parliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head of
the local administration and a director of the steel combine which
employs 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.

But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper's
role was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate and
encourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does not
agitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates for
something else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openly
one or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,
think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.

In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker
provided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carried
extensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores of
letters from its readers.

Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the then
pro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, was
the dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225
directly-elected seats.

Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies which
many critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldly
launched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promising
to improve the lot of the elderly.

But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercely
contested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tirade
against the government's policies and promised a restoration of the
certainties of the Soviet era.

These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers who
expressed impassioned and disparate views.

'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They were
given work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honest
person will vote for the Communists,' said one.

'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of the
past but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commented
another.

One reader planned not to participate in the elections at all given
they were merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country from
its true problems' while another condemned the newspaper itself for
giving too much space to the 'so-called democrats'.

The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoral
tactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsible
for them in order not to prejudice opinions.

In the week before the vote, it carried an item about a pensioner who
had been contacted by someone claiming to represent the local telephone
company.

'Vote correctly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for a
year,' the mysterious caller promised.

On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go to
the polls although it recognised that many voters were still confused
by the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.

The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did not
publish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. The
electors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok as
their local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest vote
backing Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
party and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seats
assigned on the basis of proportional representation.

In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garner
more than the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225
seats in the 450-strong parliament allocated by proportional
representation. Mr Pochinok, for example, has been elected as a
representative of a party which will be unable to form its own faction
in parliament.

One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you must
write that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. We
must go forward to the presidential elections but people must be
vigilant.'

ZEROUAL PICKS LITTLE-KNOWN DIPLOMAT AS PM

   By ROULA KHALAF

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has chosen a little-known career
diplomat as the country's new prime minister.

Mr Zeroual, elected president in November, on Sunday named Mr Ahmed
Ouyahia, his 43-year-old head of cabinet, to replace Mr Mokdad Sifi who
had been asked to stay on until the end of the year.

Most Algerians met Mr Ouyahia, who comes from the Berber province of
Tizi-Ouzou, for the first time when he appeared on state television
last July to read a statement telling them that the last round of talks
with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had collapsed. The FIS
has been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believed
to have taken a lead part in the negotiations.

That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has known
points to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generation
in a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under the
age of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on Mr
Zeroual's post election politics.

'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionary
rather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expert
yesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not what
really concerns him.'

Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a year
because Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he has
yet to commit himself to a specific date.

The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reforms
agreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for the
elections.

Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging an
accord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Mali
government in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilful
negotiator.

He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of the
accord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghreb
affairs in 1993.

Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat with
negotiating skills points to a determination on the part of the
president to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with the
FIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential election
are likely to be conducted directly from the president's office rather
than that of the prime minister.

In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the prime
minister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.

JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT

   By GERARD BAKER

   TOKYO


Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasingly
sceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend more
than Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housing
loan companies.

In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start of
what is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout in
the new parliamentary session which begins later this month.

The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, which
will cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said it
had been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.

He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of the
seven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entire
problem,' he added.

Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year's
budget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of the
bankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself to
spending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greater
than is forecast.

The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the
1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loans
which were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to the
property sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.

Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money has
escalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited by
opposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the national
budget begins at the end of January.

Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition New
Frontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to oppose
the bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory and
detailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.

The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's anger
by hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,
Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice minister
for finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for the
housing loan problem.

But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread much
more liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.

In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and most
intriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade minister
and leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalition
partner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when most
of the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.

In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financial
institutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.
But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders which
continued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.

The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstances
of the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those found
responsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held to
account.

But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the current
political heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largest
coalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are some
officials in the finance ministry.

If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalition
may break ranks and oppose the deal.

Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plans
for 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for its
viability.

INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES

   By GREG EARL

   JAKARTA


Indonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'
receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent on
market forces for their growth, according to a study.

The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,
conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,
also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half the
country's gross domestic product.

The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed a
distinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences for
business growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were now
dependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many of
the larger groups had been established under those business conditions.

The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in
1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).

The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of the
largest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase in
sales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars
350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 there
were estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of sales
accounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.

Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groups
controlling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the
300 businesses.

The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlined
by the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnic
Indonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.

While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,
several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to have
grown by 50 per cent in 1994.

CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER

   By ROULA KHALAF

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who was yesterday entrusted with
the running of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has been
described as more conservative than the king, less likely to
accommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raise
prices.

However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabia
run by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic and
foreign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under King
Fahd.

If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of the
government may be no more than a temporary measure and, until Crown
Prince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to have
the final word on big decisions.

One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the
71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoys
important ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had a
different mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant that
he comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King Abdul
Aziz.

But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince when
the latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source of
rivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known to
stick together when times get rough.

The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seems
to disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his main
source of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, a
largely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts as
counterweight to the army.

In view of his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as a
reported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base in
Saudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed to
be less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not known
to speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivating
links with the Arab world.

This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on the
Kingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US alliance
is a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much to
change,' a diplomat said.

Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played a
prominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for the
Gulf war.

'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' said
one veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince. 'The king is
very cautious and tends to see procrastination as a virtue. Abdullah is
less hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'

Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forceful
dealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdom
with faxes from a propaganda base in London.

Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated the
November 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guard
communications centre in Riyadh.

As the budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reforms started in
1994 will continue. Faced with collapse of oil prices, Saudi Arabia has
had to clamp down on spending in recent years, give the private sector
a larger role and boost non-oil revenues.

In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt you
know the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war and
that your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatment
so matters could return to what they used to be - strength and
balance.'

The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude output
at 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, when
it was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats said
yesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour a
policy of holding back production.

'I think the crown prince will continue the policy of keeping oil
prices stable, and the kingdom cannot relax on the economic front but
will have to continue with reforms,' a diplomat said.

As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said that for as long as the
crown prince was only acting on behalf of the king, he would have to
find a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothers to
minimise friction.

This may mean that he will resort to consultation and seek the
co-operation of powerful members such as Prince Sultan, defence
minister and next in line of succession.

TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE

   By PATTI WALDMEIR

   WASHINGTON


US President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaders
later today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budget
dispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failed
to yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the more
immediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.

Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, before
recessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisions
were taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areas
of disagreement.

But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were now
ready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs of
some flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: several
of them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear that
they were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) tax
cut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was more
important than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest tax
cut.

Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiations
would focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxes
and welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed by
both sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the two
sides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies the
budget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal government
to the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guarantees
of healthcare for the poor and elderly.

Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year's
presidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gear
with a concentration of state presidential primary elections in
February and March.

Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problem
of getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,
which has already lasted more than a fortnight.

The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from the
frustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends at
the Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended a
traditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,
manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the decline
of civility'.

RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OF
NATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON MAY AGAIN
DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF ITS MAIN INDUSTRY

   By TONY HAWKINS

Cecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony.

Twenty five years after Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president,
nationalised the country's copper mines, the government of President
Frederick Chiluba may be on the verge of taking the first step towards
meeting its promise to put the industry back into the private sector.

Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility study
for the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close to
conclusion, say industry officials.

It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,
seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was once
little more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.

Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Cape
to Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -
I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declared
Mr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialist
programme.

Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London could
determine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia's
economy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.

With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to be
exhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mounting
pressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
Konkola project.

Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South African
mining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare a
study and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will be
controversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.
The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for the
privatisation of ZCCM itself.

While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year
 - by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had been
processed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment and
expertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive copper
mining industry has been slow.

Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses has
passed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, in
the form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda is
back on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October's
presidential elections.

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, published
last month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of more
than Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.
In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, or
expanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.

The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in food
processing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation in
cement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and Anglo
American in hotels.

The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in
1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exporters
Nigeria and Angola.

Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just months
before elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba's
Movement for Multiparty Democracy.

The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremely
painful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, high
inflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.

That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to its
knees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United National
Independence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to cast
their ballots.

Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had the
privatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, been
implemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not had
two droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able to
exploit a period of strong demand and high prices.

Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output of
about 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less than
half the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.

In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of global
producers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow as
Nchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffers
from the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,
reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.

If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venture
between the government, whose contribution is likely to take the form
of providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - thereby
further weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-led
consortium, which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in the
scheme.

While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leave
Mr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.

An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure an
increasingly restive donor community.

The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck an
equivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' in
privatising the mines.

'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which was
interpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.

SRI LANKA'S WAR EUPHORIA FADES

   By AMAL JAYASINGHE

   COLOMBO


The euphoria that erupted when Sri Lanka's military scored a
significant victory last month over separatist Tamil rebels in their
northern stronghold of Jaffna has sharply diminished with steep price
increases coming into effect in the New Year to pay mounting war bills.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga yesterday promised to press ahead with
a carrot-and-stick strategy to end more than two decades of ethnic
violence which has claimed more than 50,000 lives.

'The economic cost of the war will have an all-round effect in terms of
higher prices,' Mr GL Peiris, deputy finance minister, said. 'This is
a war for peace, so there is no question that we have to find the
resources for it.'

The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, up
from a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.

The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo Stock
Exchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid falling
foreign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per cent
against the dollar in 1995.

Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capital
abroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which last
month galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.

It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus fares
by 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, depending
on the rate of consumption.

However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said the
economic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflows
expected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.

The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capital
from privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunications
operator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections are
considered too optimistic by private analysts.

Government politicians said the rising prices and the government's
failure to turn the military success into a political victory had
turned initial enthusiasm into despondency.

Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are still
able to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.
Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillas
laden with explosives.

Tamils who fled the fighting in Jaffna are sheltered in areas of the
country's north still under rebel dominance. The Tigers say they will
not allow civilians to cross over to government-held areas of Jaffna,
though defence analysts say that doing so would help the Tigers to go
home and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.

The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its
35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region are
dominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and the
navy.

Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army would
soon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive that
would cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was already
bracing for it.

ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET

   By DANIEL DOMBEY

   MEXICO CITY


A year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-out
from Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last week
made further changes to a government still struggling with the
unpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.

Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised for
links to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,
has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country's
comptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile to
get to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr Carlos
Salomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target of
complaints about the administration's news management at times when
speculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also been
removed.

The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicate
any big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr Jesus
Reyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration advocating a
more interventionist economic approach, the new comptroller general, Mr
Arsenio Farell, helped push through the wage-labour pacts that then
provided the centrepiece of economic policy.

Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under the
political difficulties of the government's first year and set the stage
for further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardy
reaction to months of criticism.

'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a more
thorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, a
politics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate research
institution.

Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test until
congressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetition
this year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wing
opposition party establish control over roughly a third of local
government, and win three of five governorship elections.

With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per cent
growth this year, Mr Zedillo's new appointees will find themselves the
focus of added attention in their tasks of managing the government's
relationship with the press, reducing bureaucratic profligacy and
reforming and attracting new investment to the country's energy sector.

FT GUIDE TO 1996


JANUARY

1st Italy takes over the presidency of the European Union, the EU's
customs union with Turkey starts, and Copenhagen begins its term as
European Cultural Capital. Austria celebrates its 1,000th anniversary
as a nation this year.

8th The return of George Michael, whose new single, Jesus To A Child,
goes on sale today. It is his first release since he ended his contract
with Sony Music, and also the first record release for DreamWorks, run
by its billionaire co-founder, David Geffen.

12th - 17th Fifth World Hot Air Airships Championships in Aosta, Italy.

14th Portuguese presidential elections - first round. Outgoing
President Mario Soares, who is completing his second five-year term,
cannot stand again.

17th Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia movement, goes on
trial in Milan, charged with bribing officials of the Guardia di
Finanza (financial police). A guilty verdict could destroy Forza Italia
and damage the right-wing alliance of which it is the core.

19th Annual summit of Comesa (Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa) in Windhoek.

Japan - US aviation talks in Tokyo.

20th Palestinians elect their own assembly for the first time in
history. Over a million registered voters in Gaza and the West Bank
will choose a legislative council and a president of the council.
Yassir Arafat leads the betting to become president. His Fatah party is
expected to do less well, but will almost certainly emerge as the
single biggest bloc.

21st The approximate start of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.
The precise timing depends on the first sighting of the crescent moon.
Office hours in some countries are limited.

23rd Another Milanese corruption trial. Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco
Ferre and other Italian fashion stars face the court charged with
corruption over allegations that fashion houses paid tax inspectors for
lenient audits.

28th Superbowl XXX in Phoenix closes the American football season.

FEBRUARY

1st - 6th The annual gathering of the political and business clans at
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

2nd Daiwa Bank due to withdraw from the US for concealing bond trading
losses.

7th Haiti continues its crawl towards democracy, as President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide hands over power to Mr Rene Preval, his
ideological clone, who won the December election. But Mr Aristide is
not ready for retirement and will stand again in 2000.

9th A look at one of the few artistic phenomena to have run the course
of the century: 'Abstraction in the 20th century: Total Risk, Freedom,
Discipline', an exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum until May
12.

14th The cricket World Cup starts, to be played in India, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka. Traditionally the World Cup chains most of south Asia to the
television set while evoking only modest interest elsewhere.

Now is the time to claim that you are the long lost heir to the Tsarist
crown. At New York's Metropolitan Museum from the 16th, the exhibition
Faberge in America features Imperial Easter Eggs commissioned by the
last Tsars. Later in February, the remains of Russia's final Tsar,
Nicholas II, will be buried in St Petersburg.

18th Polish referendum on methods of privatisation.

19th The Chinese Year of the Rat begins. Rat years have been auspicious
for Japanese stock prices.

20th A good day for rice growers outside Indonesia. This year Idul
Fitri, the celebration at the end of Ramadan, the Islamic fasting
month, falls before the main Indonesian rice harvest is completed. Rice
demand peaks during Idul Fitri, so the country's rice bowl managers are
scouring the world for supplies.

20th New Hampshire opens the US presidential primary season proper,
though Iowa will have chosen the first delegates in party caucuses on
February 12. Bill Clinton is unopposed on the Democratic side so the
main interest centres on whether any Republican can stop Senator Bob
Dole. After New Hampshire the primaries come thicker, faster and
earlier than ever, with 24 states holding them by March 26. The two
main parties' nominations could thus be decided by Easter.

MARCH

1st - 2nd Heads of state meet for the first ever Asian-EU Summit in
Bangkok.

2nd Alan Greenspan's second four-year term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board expires. President Bill Clinton will probably nominate
him for a third term, in order to minimise disruption in the financial
markets during the election campaign.

3rd Spain holds general elections a year before schedule, with the
conservative Popular party expecting its first crack at government.
Knee-deep in scandals, Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government
could not postpone the day any longer, as its allies have walked out.
But Gonzalez is still a man to watch, and the outcome could be closer
than the conservatives think.

8th United Nations troops to leave Rwanda.

Japan's budget to be passed at an ordinary parliamentary session.

15th - 17th Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson formally hands over
power to his successor Goran Persson at a Social Democratic party
congress.

16th - 17th Robert Mugabe seeks a new term in Zimbabwean presidential
elections.

Gianni Agnelli, 74, is expected to hand over as Fiat chairman to Cesare
Romiti, 72, perhaps some time around Agnelli's 75th birthday on March
12. Romiti, only the second non - family chairman in Fiat's history,
will preside over an interregnum, probably preparing for the fourth
generation: Giovanni Alberto, Gianni's nephew.

23rd Taiwan holds its first presidential election by universal suffrage.

25th - 27th Inter - American Development Bank annual meeting in Buenos
Aires.

29th The EU's inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht
treaty opens in Turin. The conference later switches to monthly
meetings between EU foreign ministers. The IGC will consider beefing up
the EU's common foreign and security policy, and extending powers to
the European Parliament. Germany is leading calls for more majority
voting, but the UK is resisting. Insiders therefore predict an IGC
deadlock in late 1996, followed by an agreement with a new government
after the UK general election, to be held by April 1997.

APRIL

1st The world's largest bank, the newly merged Bank of Tokyo -
Mitsubishi, opens. The bank will not just be big - by Japanese
standards it will also be financially strong, with one of the lowest
proportions of non-performing loans on its balance sheet and a wide
presence in international markets.

The merger is expected to herald a broader consolidation of the
Japanese banking industry, as the other large banks seek partners to
enable them to compete with the new giant.

1st China plans to slash import tariffs on 4,000 items to an average 23
per cent in its quest for WTO membership.

9th - 12th International Atomic Energy Agency conference in Vienna on
10 years after the Chernobyl disaster

11th Uniquely in recent European history, a former prime minister goes
on trial charged with complicity in a murder. Giulio Andreotti of Italy
faces a Perugia court over the death in 1979 of the journalist Mino
Pecorelli.

11th - 12th US Masters golf in Augusta

14th South Korean parliamentary elections

15th - 16th European Bank for Reconstruction and Development annual
meeting in Sofia.

15th - 16th Ministerial meeting between the EU and Rio Group countries
in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

16th - 18th President Clinton visits Japan.

20th to May 11th Unctad four-yearly conference in Midrand, South
Africa. The heads of state of 187 countries are invited.

21st Queen Elizabeth II turns 70

India will probably go to the polls in April for a general election
unlikely to deliver a strong, single party government. The campaign
will be dominated by opposition allegations of Congress party
corruption. Congress will portray the right-wing, Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata party as being divisively based on religion. Economic
issues may not feature heavily, aside from BJP appeals to 'economic
nationalism'.

30th Deadline for completing negotiations on liberalising basic
telecommunications services, under auspices of the World Trade
Organisation.

MAY

9th The day by which South Africa has to unveil its new constitution.
Among the issues to be resolved are whether there will still be a
government of national unity and the powers of the provinces.

9th - 20th The Cannes Film Festival

16th The Dominican Republic votes in a presidential election which, for
the first time in 30 years, will involve neither Joaqun Balaguer nor
Juan Bosch, the two octogenarians who have dominated the country's
politics. Mr Bosch has retired because of poor health, while Mr
Balaguer cannot stand for a seventh term because changes in the
constitution prevent consecutive terms.

17th The trial of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma
City bombing of 1995 is due to open.

17th to August 25th. The Glyndebourne Festival Opera in southern
England. The pick of the 1996 festival will be Handel's 'Theodora' and
Berg's 'Lulu'.

21st - 22nd Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development
annual meeting of finance, foreign and trade ministers.

22nd Degas: Beyond Impressionism exhibition. Degas achieved fame with
his work of the 1870s and 1880s, above all with pictures of the ballet
and the racecourse, but his experimental later work has never been
properly studied, and this will be the first big show devoted to it. It
runs at the National Gallery, London, until August 26, and moves to the
Art Institute of Chicago in September.

22nd World Health Organisation publishes the World Health Report, which
is expected to highlight the danger of bacterial resistance to drugs.
Such infections as tuberculosis and gonorrhea have become resistant to
drugs and have outpaced the development of antibiotics to control them.

22nd - 24th The African Development Bank annual meeting in Abidjan.

31st The World Health Organisation marks World No-Tobacco Day.

31st - June 1st The Czech Republic's first general election since its
'velvet divorce' from Slovakia in 1992. The centre-right Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus leads the polls.

JUNE

5th Opec general conference in Vienna.

Vietnam's eighth Communist party congress is due to take place in Hanoi
this month.

8th - 30th European Championship soccer. Can the persistently mediocre
England team use home advantage to win its first important trophy in 30
years? The game against the Netherlands should be testing, and the one
against Scotland colourful. The match with the least tourist potential
is Bulgaria versus Romania in Newcastle. The Germans, the Italians and
the Dutch are the best bets to win the championship, and the Turks are
the worst.

10th Annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),
attended by central bankers from around the world.

The Italian general elections, expected this February, May, June or
sometime later. It is a mystery when Italy's political parties will
agree to hold the early polls. If the elections are not held in the
first half of 1996, the life of parliament will probably be prolonged
until the spring of 1997.

16th Scheduled date for the Russian presidential elections, and the
year's most likely source of political shock. The Russian constitution
vests vast powers in the presidency, and some analysts fear that a
Communist candidate, or, even worse, an ultra-nationalist, may win.
However, businessmen and politicians close to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin are already urging him to postpone the poll. Will Yeltsin be
fit to fight?

21st - 30th Gays and lesbians hold the Europride conference in
Copenhagen.

22nd - 23rd EU summit of heads of state and government in Florence.

24th The Wimbledon tennis tournament starts, and the search for British
heroes (anyone who reaches the second round) is on.

27th - 29th Heads of government and finance ministers from the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries gather in Lyons for their annual
economic summit. In recent years the G7 has tried to scale back the
pomp and ceremony which accompanies these jamborees, but it is not yet
clear that President Jacques Chirac, the host, will be able to resist
arranging something spectacular. France, which is chairing the G7 in
1996, wants the meeting to concentrate on development, while the
leaders are also expected to use the meeting to accelerate reform of
United Nations institutions.

30th Hong Kong enters its last year under British rule.

JULY

1st Ireland takes over the EU presidency.

7th - 12th Eleventh International Conference on Aids in Vancouver.

19th The Proms. The world's biggest music festival enters its second
century under new director Nicholas Kenyon. At London's Royal Albert
Hall until September 14.

19th The centenary edition of the modern Olympics meets a steamy
southern summer in Atlanta, Georgia, which perhaps explains why the
most sought-after seats have been for the swimming and diving
competititions. Going on the off-chance is not advised since just about
all tickets are long gone by lottery or to sponsors. A total of 26
sports will be on display, with only women's softball as a newcomer
(don't sniff, the fastballs come in at 90mph). Some refinements
elsewhere: for instance, mountain bikes have been added to the cycling
classification. The Games end on August 4.

20th The Salzburg Festival, until August 31. Of the three new opera
productions, the most intriguing is Beethoven's 'Fidelio', which pairs
octogenarian conductor Georg Solti with radical German
producer-designer Herbert Wernicke. The other show to catch is the
Pierre Boulez-Peter Stein production of Schoenberg's 'Moses und Aron'.

Some time this summer Stanley Kubrick, one of Hollywood's most
influential but least productive film makers, starts shooting Eyes Wide
Shut starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in London. Kubrick, a
legendary figure in the film world, has written, directed and produced
a string of successes from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Dr Strangelove. He
is a notorious perfectionist - the actor Jack Nicholson said he 'gives
new meaning to the word meticulous' - and has not made a film since
Full Metal Jacket in 1987.

31st Japan-US semiconductor accord to expire.

AUGUST

11th - 31st The 50th Edinburgh International Festival. Productions by
Robert Wilson, Robert Lepage and Peter Stein, orchestras from
Cleveland, Moscow, New York and Oslo, plus Houston Grand Opera.

12th Liberian presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled.

12th - 15th US Republican party national convention in San Diego,
California, followed from August 27 to 29 by the Democratic party
national convention in Chicago, Illinois. Both are later than usual
because of the Olympics. The main order of business for both is to
crown candidates for president and vice president, with the latter
usually providing what suspense there is. But conventions, by also
endorsing party platforms, can set a tone for the autumn campaign for
the White House. The harsh rightwing notes sounded by the Republicans
in Houston in 1992 got George Bush off on the wrong foot, while the
left's anti-war riots in Chicago in 1968 gave Hubert Humphrey a
handicap he never overcame. Party managers try to script convention
business to the last minute, ensuring that candidates get maximum
exposure, but perfect discipline is often hard to impose on committed
delegates.

16th Indonesia's President Suharto delivers the annual State of the
Nation address, marking his country's Independence Day on August 17. He
is not a man for saying a lot in public, so few of his citizens will
watch anything else on television today. This year's speech will be
more interesting than most, because Mr Suharto will outline how he
thinks the country should behave as it prepares for the five - yearly
elections which begin in 1997. Deciphering a speech from the man who
has run the country for 28 years usually requires the delphic qualities
of a Javanese dukun. But identifying who he thinks should win the
elections shouldn't be difficult.

19th Bill Clinton turns 50. If he loses the White House in November, he
faces the prospect of a great many rounds of golf.

25th - 26th London celebrates the 31st Notting Hill Carnival. On the
second day, Britain takes a summer Bank Holiday.

SEPTEMBER

1st The second anniversary of the IRA ceasefire, if peace holds in
Northern Ireland.

9th The 20th anniversary of Mao's death will be cause for cautious
recognition by the Chinese Communist party, which has a deep fear that
anniversaries will be turned into occasions for popular protest. Even
the party faithful have mixed views about Mao - he is officially
reckoned to have been '70 per cent right, 30 per cent wrong' in his
role as the Great Helmsman.

9th - 13th Britain's Trades Union Congress holds its annual conference
in Blackpool.

14th Jewish New Year 5757 starts.

17th United Nations General Assembly opens in New York.

19th Fiftieth anniversary of Winston Churchill's call for a 'United
States of Europe'.

20th - 22nd The Pope visits France.

30th Crunch time arrives for Spain's prospects for joining the European
single currency. This is the deadline for submitting the crucial 1997
budget. The Euro was launched in Madrid, but Spain won't be a founding
member unless the government - possibly a new conservative
administration - manages to slash the public sector deficit. Not that
Spain is the only EU member facing this particular problem.

30th The British Labour's party conference runs in Blackpool until
October 4. If Labour can avoid turbulence, it will surely romp home in
1997 - or possibly earlier. This means that the party's detailed tax
plans are expected to be kept in reserve until the last minute, while
the conference will only be asked to rubber stamp the final elements of
Labour's policy review, including a long-awaited statement on social
security reforms. Tony Blair should already be profiting from two
by-election victories early in the New Year, and will attempt to
exploit the government's vanishing majority on key issues such as
Europe.

OCTOBER

1st - 3rd The annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.

8th - 11th The British Tory party conference in Bournemouth. Possibly
John Major's last as prime minister, so pretenders will bid for the
succession.

15th-29th: British International Motor Show at the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham. The days of bikini - clad models draped across
shiny bonnets at motor fairs have generally given way to sober
salesmanship. This show opens to the public from October 18.

16th Organisers of 1995's Million Man March are planning a Million
Family March in Washington for today.

29th Last possible date for Israeli elections to be held.

29th The winner of the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, is named in London. Expect critical face-gouging. Last
year, super-heavyweight Salman Rushdie (4-5 favourite for The Moor's
Last Sigh) was stylishly outpointed by fast-punching middleweight Pat
Barker (5-1; The Ghost Road). Things can only get bloodier.

30th Helmut Kohl will have been German chancellor for 5,144 days, as
long as Konrad Adenauer, who took the job in 1949 aged 73. Having
outrun his idol, Mr Kohl must hang on until 2001 to become the longest
serving chancellor ever, upstaging Bismarck, who held office for 6,940
days from 1871 to 1890. Will he make it? Mr Kohl says he expects to
quit in 1998. But Der Spiegel, the news magazine Mr Kohl refuses to
read, already calls him 'Bismarck in a cardigan'.

NOVEMBER

5th US election day - for president and vice president, all 435 seats
in the House of Representatives and 33 in the Senate, plus a full card
of state and local races. This could be a pivotal election if
Republicans win the White House and hold on to majorities in Congress.
Bill Clinton is still favourite for a second term, but not by much.
With eight of 15 incumbent Democrats not seeking re-election,
Republicans hope to increase their current 53 seats in Senate to a
filibuster-proof 60. The House, now with 236 Republicans, is often more
volatile. Voter turn-out may approach 60 per cent only if the field is
fleshed out by interesting independent or third party candidates (Ross
Perot helped lift it to 55 per cent in 1992).

10th - 12th The Confederation of British Industry annual conference in
Harrogate.

11th Germans begin their annual goose-eating binge. Germany may be a
highly developed industrial nation, but it still fusses over customs
and likes to observe saints' days, possibly because these have
developed a commercial momentum. The feast day in this case is St
Martin's, and the carnival starts in the Rhineland at 11.11am.

13th - 17th The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's World Food
Summit in Rome. Heads of state and government meet from November 16 to
17.

26th Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, will deliver his fourth
Budget or Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will deliver his first.
If Mr Clarke is still at Number 11, the 1996 Budget should be much like
1995's: modest tax cuts paid for with modest cuts in public spending
plans. If Mr Brown has moved in, the content is less clear. Not only
has Labour avoided revealing much about its tax plans, but Mr Brown may
discover that Mr Clarke has left him little room for manoeuvre.
Incoming governments traditionally say they have had to scale back
their plans because 'the books have been left in much worse shape than
we expected'.

The Bibliotheque Nationale de France, dubbed the 'tres grande
bibliotheque', is scheduled to open to the public in Paris late this
month. Approved by former President Francois Mitterrand in 1988, and
built at a cost of FFr8bn, four angled tower blocks symbolise open
books, surrounding a suspended garden. The public will have access to
400,000 books.

DECEMBER

6th-7th EU summit in Dublin. The Netherlands takes over the presidency
at the start of 1997.

9th - 13th Singapore hosts the first World Trade Organisation
ministerial meeting.

10th The Nobel peace prize is awarded in Oslo.

On a date in December yet to be fixed, the US Electoral College meets
to certify the results of the November election. The winner in the
national popular vote can still lose the election if his opponent
carries states with a majority in the Electoral College. These are
apportioned, winner-take-all, according to state population, ranging
from California's 54 delegates to three each for various smaller
states.

The world's tallest office buildings are due to be completed in the
centre of Kuala Lumpur in 1996, and to be dedicated this month. At 450
metres, the twin Petronas Towers will be slightly taller than Chicago's
Sears building. The project forms part of the plan of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister, to turn Malaysia into a fully
industrialised country by 2020. Opponents accuse him of indulging in
grandiose schemes of questionable economic benefit. Furthermore, they
add, the towers will soon be overtaken by other Far Eastern rivals.

Russian economists and western agencies have predicted that 1996 will
be the first year that Russia's nascent market economy experiences
positive growth. The Organisation for Economic Co - operation and
Development, for instance, forecasts a growth rate of 2 per cent. An
economic upswing could boost the flagging political fortunes of Russian
reformers; on the other hand, political instability could still
undermine the country's economic prospects.

Some time towards the end of 1996, or otherwise early in 1997, 10m
savers and borrowers with Britain's Halifax Building Society will get
free Halifax shares when the society floats.

FIAT STEPS UP DRIVE FOR IMPORT POSITION

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

Fiat Auto UK is restructuring its dealer networks as part of a campaign
to regain its status as one of the UK new car market's biggest
importers.

The company is reorganising its 220-strong Fiat dealer network and
increasing its Alfa-Romeo dealerships by 25 per cent.

The moves strengthening the dealer networks come as the Italian group's
wholly-owned UK subsidiary prepares today to launch its Bravo and Brava
models. They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astra
and other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UK
new car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the new
models.

The models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 per cent-plus
market share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr James Blades,
Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures to show
that Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total sales
approaching 75,000 including about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales.

Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales of
Lancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.
Yet for much of the 1980s, its share slid downwards - mainly because
of the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it had
slumped to less than 2 per cent.

So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to the
UK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -
currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.

However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, has
already brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are now
working hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.
That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject to
the whims of private buyers.'

Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new car
market in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Within
this total, fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to private
buyers have stagnated.

The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers is
underlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 are
expected to be bought by fleets.

Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformance
of the new car market overall. At 67,400, Fiat's total sales in the
first 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in
1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car market
overall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 per
cent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth is
underlined by the fact that the model segment in which they will
compete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.

Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size of
the network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,
less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailing
groups.

As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30 per cent
of the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100 retailing groups
which are capable of making the substantial investment that Fiat wants
to see.

POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY

The poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters of
their income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.

Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottom
fifth of Britain's households in the past financial year (1994-95),
according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economic
trends.

Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of the
poorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.

Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes and
benefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.

Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than the
lowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.

The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their gross
income in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by other
households.

State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefits
received by retired households, the study finds.

The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those still
at work than those who have retired.

But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retired
than among working households.

The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of gross
domestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latest
year for which complete figures are available - the south-east, home
to 31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent of
GDP.

The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced
9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.

Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 per
cent.

The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 per
head - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.

The lowest was Northern Ireland where it was Pounds 8,027 per head and
Wales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.

But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher in
Northern Ireland than any other region since 1990.

Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDP
in Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in East
Anglia and the south-west.

TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Senior left-of-centre Con-servatives yesterday warned the government to
tone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West and
Torridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.

As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame the
long-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr Peter
Temple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent of
personal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson. He argued that the
criticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wake
of her defection.

In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, has
claimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated and
unsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post in the government.

Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticism
yesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history of
disloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher in
the 1990 Conservative leadership contest.

However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is often
associated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on Miss
Nicholson were further damaging party morale.

'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough without
personalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situation
in which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'

Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language with
which Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting that
ministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.

'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulging
in this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who have
anxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should see
we are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselves
together and can work together.'

Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of Miss
Nicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by further
defections.

But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, the
MP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect to
opposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one of
the most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his every
move watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.

Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors are
Mr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; Sir
Keith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; and
Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.

None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move to
another party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - have
indicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminster
by announcing that they will not be standing at the next general
election. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.

SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR

   By JOHN AUTHERS

Consumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to the
annual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out by
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery company.

While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -
perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the most
popular sweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.

Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,
from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturers
attributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending on
chocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.

Kit Kat sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars Bars
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.

A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said Kit
Kat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 per
cent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from
16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.

Mars made changes to its product in 1995 in an attempt to appeal to
women and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sized
versions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter.

Cadbury's Dairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popular
chocolate.

In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polo
mints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review by
Trebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit by
Wrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the better
known Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.

The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,
with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Average
spending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.

The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which include
cough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett. But it
added: 'There remains enormous future potential for market growth - we
still have quite a way to go before we match the per capita consumption
for sweets of our European neighbours.'

ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECTS SUFFER DOUBLE BLOW

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY, Economics Staff

A gloomier outlook for the UK economy emerged today with a leading
forecaster predicting that growth will slow in 1996 and with the
publication of a poll which shows that business confidence is at its
lowest since 1992.

The latest report by Cambridge Econometrics, the economic consultancy,
says a slowdown in the rest of the world will depress Britain's exports
this year. It says companies will also cut output as they try to sell
the stocks they built up in 1995.

As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 per
cent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent last year. This prediction
clashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth in
1996.

But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting group
says. It thinks that spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996
and then expand strongly next year - partly because of expected tax
cuts in the next Budget.

Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bank
shows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in
1992. For the first time, the survey shows an increase in those
businesses reporting cashflow problems and a slowdown in export
orders.

Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowest
rate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence has
dropped because economic growth has been disappointingly slow.

Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,
said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they are
having difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflation
economy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made them
somewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.

Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowest
growth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and catering
businesses reported strong growth. Companies told Lloyds Bank that
investment spending has slowed because of slower profit growth and
increased pressure on cashflow. However, Cambridge Econometrics
predicts that investment will pick up in 1996 as the private finance
initiative fills much of the gap left by cuts in government capital
spending.

The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks in
the motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral product
industries. It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the short
term in response to lower mortgage interest rates, although the
underlying rate will remain broadly unchanged.

In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in
1997 from 3.1 per cent at present.

WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THE
PFI AND TACKLING FRAUD

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Like the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between the
Treasury and government departments over public spending seem to get
earlier every year.

The detail of the last public spending round was published only a month
ago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the opening
skirmishes of this year's battle.

Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that he
planned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking at
the spending of larger departments in spring, before the haggling
proper gets under way.

The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,
according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will be
Whitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target in
any search for savings.

'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of the
possibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'Peter
Lilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be delivered
in a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a few
years' time' can be made any shorter.'

Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big an
increase in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. But
he argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening control
of the benefit system.

Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social security
claimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
for some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.

He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London with
swipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to do
early in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,
non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundred
million,' he said.

Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private finance
initiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise into
public sector infrastructure projects.

'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutional
resistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for public
expenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.

Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that
economic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructure
hiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But Mr
Waldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quickly
than the Treasury assumed in the Budget.

There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings from
government spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out the
idea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritage
because of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.

But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was a
personal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that arts
organisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit the
centralisation of public support for the arts, although it would not
necessarily save money.

Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for public
spending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares of
national income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.

Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better role
models, implying a government share of national income of 35 per cent
or 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of national
income, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.

Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching a
stage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spending
negotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the idea
that departments could agree a tough settlement on the understanding
that their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But he
conceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretary
would not feel bound by the pledge.

So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains with
us. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they are
under, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest rounds
in living memory.

POLICY FOR TERRORISM INSURANCE UNDER ATTACK: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HAS
LITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE ROLE OF REINSURER
POOL RE

   By RALPH ATKINS

When the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993, causing more
than Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful that anyone was
prepared to provide insurance against further attacks.

With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercial
policies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'
company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers
- was seen as a sensible response.

Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies due
for renewal, the mood has changed.

Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurance
buyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies to
choose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or risk
going without.

The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:
a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re also
collects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of the
year; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during the
year do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).

But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial property
policies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chief
executive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we once
had it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'

There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing the
development of an alternative terrorism insurance market.

When Pool Re started in 1993 it had no capital and operated as a
mutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on its services. It
insists member insurance companies only sell terrorism cover at rates
and on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into an insurance fund
which at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but is likely now to be
substantially higher. Because most insurers are Pool Re members,
companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.

Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurance
policies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart from
smaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.

Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is only
limited scope for taking account of measures individual companies might
take to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.

Mr Alan Gavaghan, the deputy chairman of insurance broker Willis
Corroon, says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on risk
prevention action, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proof
windows. They have put a lot of thought into it, but they are treated
in the same way as people with clapped-out warehouses.'

Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers which
combined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates at
Lloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.

Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up to
Pounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means large
companies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.

But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Prices
may also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch from
Pool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, of
Willis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for those
who want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'

In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and Risk
Managers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.

'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.
'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is also
little sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return to
providing full terrorism cover without state back-up.

The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flat
contribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies. That should
allow a return to the automatic provision of terrorism cover. As funds
are built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism
 - there would be scope for contributions holidays.

Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurer
providing cover against other perils where the incidence is low but
potential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possible
example.

The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -
spreading big risks on the shoulders of many. Ms Barker says:
'Terrorism insurance ought to be automatic for the benefit of society.'

BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

Thousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communities
faced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to a
dramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems. In some
areas, temperatures soared from - 20'C to around 7'C.

In Scotland, 500,000 Strathclyde homes suffered burst pipes at some
point over the holiday. Water rationing was introduced in parts of
Northern Ireland as reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst
pipes. More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were
being used in some areas.

The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for public
housing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short of
materials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supply
stores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lost
because affected schools, factories and offices were closed for the
holidays.

Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spent
yesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies from
the river Towy. In England North West Water brought in extra staff to
cope with phone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw included
Northumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.
Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teams
were working to restore services.

NEW YEAR PLAN CONDEMNED: SCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

Scottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottish
banking industry holidays into line with England. The move could make
this the last traditional new year holiday period north of the border
and set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, the
Scottish National party's employment spokeswoman.

Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -
whereas England and Wales have only January 1.

Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,
she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society are
taking second place to English clearing banks and the London Stock
Exchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, as
is proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services is
far greater at Easter than at new year.'

PLEA FOR HELP OVER FRAUD PROBE: NHS TRUSTS

   By JOHN AUTHERS

The National Health Service Executive has written to all 458 NHS trusts
asking them to co-operate with a police investigation into an alleged
fraud by locum agencies. The investigation follows routine checks last
year by the Audit Commission, the NHS watchdog, at four hospitals in
north Wales.

The Metropolitan Police's company fraud unit is now investigating the
claims. It believes that up to 80 trusts could have fallen victim to
the alleged fraud, which is said to have involved charging excessive
fees or sending duplicate invoices for the services of locum doctors
and therapists. Four people have been arrested in connection with the
allegations, and released on police bail. The total sum involved is
alleged to be about Pounds 3m.

SAINSBURY CUTS 200 PRICES: FOOD RETAILING

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

J. Sainsbury fired a new year salvo in the supermarket price war
yesterday by cutting the cost of more than 200 items by up to 50 per
cent during January. The move comes three days after frozen food
chainstore Iceland announced it was reducing some prices to those of
1986. However, Sainsbury and other leading food retailers denied that
the initiatives would trigger another round in the price war.

FISHING PATROL MOVES INTO DISPUTED AREA

   By BERNARD GRAY

HMS Lindisfarne, a UK Fisheries Protection Vessel, yesterday went on
patrol in the controversial Irish Box fishing area between western
England and Ireland to mark the first day that Spanish trawlers were
legally entitled to work in the disputed zone.

Also on standby to monitor the situation were three commercially
chartered patrol aircraft which are used to oversee fishing fleets in
British waters.

However, in spite of predictions of confrontation, none of the 20
Spanish boats which have so far registered to work in the Irish Box
appeared.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pointed to the holiday
season as a possible explanation and added that fishing conditions were
not particularly favourable in the area at present.

Meanwhile, arguments continued between British politicians about the
agreement, which allows the large Spanish trawler fleet to use the
area, traditionally the preserve of Cornish fishing fleets.

Mr David Harris, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the
Newlyn fishing port, said yesterday that Spanish access to the Irish
Box would inevitably lead to further cuts in quotas, hurting the UK
fishing industry.

Mr Harris said he had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister,
arguing that more control of fishing zones should be handed back to
individual European Union member states, rather than being regulated by
the European Commission through quotas.

'The end result is going to be massive over-fishing of stocks already
under pressure,' he said.

Yet Mr Tony Baldry, the fishing minister, said that Spanish boats would
not be able to catch any additional fish by choosing to trawl in the
Irish Box, rather than in other areas.

'They will be policed equally fiercely on the catches that they take to
make sure the fish are the proper size and are within quota, as much as
ensuring that there are no more than 40 trawlers at any one time in the
Irish Box,' he said.

The two politicians also disagreed about whether Spanish boats would
abide by the rules of the agreement to use the disputed waters.

Mr Harris predicted that Spanish trawlers would use 'every trick in the
book' to skirt the rules, while Mr Baldry argued that the Spanish boats
would comply.

'It will be a very stupid Spanish skipper who seeks to break the
rules,' said Mr Baldry. 'If he does so he will be brought into court,
he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'

NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSE - DATELINE / WASHINGTON, ANGER
THE THE 'CLOWNS OF CONGRESS' IS RISING

   By JUREK MARTIN

It is probable that the US government will still not be fully
functioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore the
rising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of those
on the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this pretty
pass.

Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not at
President Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overall
budget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at Senator
Bob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute in
standing up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for his
presidential ambitions.

No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their own
rectitude and so insulated from the real world outside their
conservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand the
damage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, if
partial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,
to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.

It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government business
will lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Important
industries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federal
bureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate of
the New Year season, has been cancelled.

There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fat
cats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractors
dependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passports
every day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to the
small towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of great
national parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent Mariposa
County has declared itself a disaster area.

They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,
but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all are
some politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streams
of US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequently
call 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtless
measure their anger.

Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence they
have given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still do
much to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than the
denial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection ever
assembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutch
master, at the National Gallery here in Washington.

Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open its
doors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarked
for future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but not
the rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrent
Winslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,
with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for precious
passes.

But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congress
comes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibition
cannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the small
businessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers have
vented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggested
that, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House of
Representatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer's
masterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well be
salutary).

A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of the
affected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the elite
and is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thus
somehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parks
might be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercial
exploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom and
Gomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.

The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they are
on unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salary
cheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So a
group of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrange
one such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message to
the state department:

'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American school
children are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, national
parks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress are
looking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,
Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of the
parents of those school children.'

Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, in
the manner of the Incas.

FT GUIDE TO THE MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?

   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

What, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? The
body set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most other
countries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it very
seriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.

Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,
thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's national
heritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhaps
add one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, and
Palumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.

Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.
Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritage
lobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (Virginia
Bottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it a
vote-gathering twist.

Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,
now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are one
of the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lottery
cash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.
To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. But
unlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 31
1999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided among
the other four.

Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It was
decided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20th
century's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiously
around the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground at
Cardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, each
applied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welsh
passions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and
'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing Cardiff
Arms Park.

So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? No
way. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially in
the media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas and
long on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions by
demanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost of
any project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makes
things hard for imaginative loonies.

But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.
It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;
Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; and
Portsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into the
world's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46m
for a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.

But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to these
national monuments. The commissioners have also set aside another
Pounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grass
roots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a go
ahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall for
Ingleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;
a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills in
Northern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds
700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders in
the River Thames.

Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords the
commissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, which
aims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just about
sums it all up.

What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, although
Imagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,
financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.

They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-long
celebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain and
Disney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites have
also been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.

Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imagination
has plumped for Birmingham.

It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb on
the international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.
With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, it
should be some celebration.

And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.
There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is no
equivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon to
amaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,
urban parks and small woodlands.

And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue ad
infinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. The
commission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produce
about Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 and
upwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass on
the improvement to their communities.

More details will be announced this month, but you will probably have
to apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting. Good
luck.

FILM AND VIDEO

   By NIGEL ANDREWS

You can always tell a new movie year. It stomps into view overturning
Christmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's first
audiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer with
horrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)
and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding over
chopping a finger.

Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint hearted
can take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle and
swash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and in
Something To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. She
twangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands
provide power casting as Mom and Pop.

In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdly
hilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish director
Lars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there is
humanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt and
Morgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murders
patterned after the seven deadly sins.

The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough with
the smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet of
stories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantino
should be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.

On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike at
the same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to the
world's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the scenery
as the horror actor Bela Lugosi.

And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendid
showbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway. The two actors won last year's
best-supporting Oscars.

PEOPLE: JOHN BROWNE, BP'S MASTER OF RECOVERY - A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO
DEBT DOES NOT RULE OUT A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH

   By ROBERT CORZINE

John Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, has marked the
completion of his first six months in office with the conclusion of a
Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) natural gas deal in Algeria.

The project, which analysts say will help turn BP into a significant
international gas company, attracted headlines mainly because of its
location in a country struggling with an Islamist insurgency. But the
deal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations for
a new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose last
expansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure of
Robert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.

That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that of
Sir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recovery
of the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company ever
again,' said one senior executive last week.

But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BP
is afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked on
big oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the world
such as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.

Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas
- Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenure
as head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept that
political risk is best spread across a range of projects in different
countries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says one
BP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have a
material effect to the company's bottom line.'

Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of such
projects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposure
during the early stages of a project, when there is likely to be
greater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,
politically or commercially viable.

Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping the
strategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had a
string of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficient
assets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.
That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,
BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.

Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling the
problems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company of
which he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes may
have an impact on BP's customer base.

He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to the
future of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,
suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technological
advantage over competitors. An announcement on the further
restructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.

Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhance
BP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment in
which proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and the
division that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.

An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. There
have been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radical
changes to the way BP conducts its business, with some observers
speculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like to
adopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.

BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-step
approach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP's
financial and performance ambitions.

One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financial
performance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cutting
costs,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from a
competitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'
That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high as
possible even in a downturn.

Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one with
elements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one which
would provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises the
importance of relationships with host governments, partners and
suppliers.

Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But big
acquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the past
appear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP will
continue to make small-scale acquisitions.

Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strong
financial performance. But in future there is likely to be greater
investor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrower
issues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.

Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highest
capital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as a
whole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'
What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand tough
scrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'

MANAGEMENT:
BIG IDEAS, BIG BOOKS - SEVEN WISE MEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON THE
CHALLENGES COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FACE IN 1996


What will be the big management challenge of 1996? And what was the
best/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?

On this page we print seven answers to these questions.

Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London Business
School:

Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused on
rationalisation and restructuring. Often this has required
fragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radical
decentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, the
challenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations to
pursue new growth opportunities.

Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, Todd
Jick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).

This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is both
idea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,
clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world of
business publications.

Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:

Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of huge
growth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a global
view of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, cost
cutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order to
maintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role of
management - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership and
sound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.

Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at all
last year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn about
business but because I did not find the time.

The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swans
by Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's cultural
revolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about the
corporate revolution.

I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other than
business.

Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:

Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',
people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My view
is not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change work
for them, and their performance has jumped as a result.

But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to world
competition, sustaining this performance improvement will be the
management challenge of 1996.

Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than those
I found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth Discipline
Fieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease of
reading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and provides
usable suggestions on almost every page.

And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly team
learning, is a key part of building competence in companies - is
intuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical ways
to manage the learning process and build competence faster. And it
complements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much more
practical experience.

Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman Sachs
International:

Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a very
short time the world has decisively changed and management will
increasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challenges
from, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economic
dynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding of
relatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to be
augmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.

Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read business
books (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, I
have read some that I would recommend.

The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell and
Alexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companies
such as GE, ABB and Canon.

My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommend
them because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in to
dramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. Andrew
Marr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.

It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with all
his conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.

I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard to
Europe (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses past
errors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, to
British negativism towards European integration.

Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:

Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over the
past 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.

They need now to get better at investing for the long term, at
marketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate should
make this possible.

Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We're
In by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave up
after the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful if
you persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),
crystal-ball gazing with insight.

David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:

Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possible
on the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountain
for that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; and
ensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there to
step in when you eventually fall off the mountain.

Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,
practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief from
consultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping in
shape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.

George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA):

Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 the
challenge of globalisation and of building global capability.

A successful global company today needs the capability to access and to
transfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors of
production, and other sources of competitive advantage.

In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives around
the world in the face of escalating costs.

Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalization
by Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business School
Press).

Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this is
the best book I have read to date on the international aspects of this
subject.

MANAGEMENT:
A PRODUCT OF POETRY - RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BE
USED IN ADVERTISING

   By RUPERT MORRIS

Readers of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank of
Switzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.

'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' have
appeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir John
Gielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses and
so on.

The poetry was chosen, according to project manager Vincento
Travaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,
courage and perseverance'.

Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In the
early years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: The
Onoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessing
to men . .

Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popular
magazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? I
was reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writing
was in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain why
these excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they were
probably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popular
consciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.

Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imagine
the Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is the
honourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happy
girls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.

But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up the
UBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TV
viewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing their
client's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authors
who are long out of copyright.

There is no end to the number of commercial interests that might
benefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.

Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,
Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetry
at its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.

No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A Shropshire
Lad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?
Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And malt
does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale's
the stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.

Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, but
self-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so I
don't think we need worry.

Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one does
feel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.

Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group of
independent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models with
flowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps they
should try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show more
fair  .

And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highest
pavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlight
in your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate for
wigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It's
so flexible.

Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly time
the army came up with something better than that macho stuff with young
lads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving like
would-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings out
those unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by Rupert
Brooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But that
first line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might as
well make it a commercial for funeral services.

Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up to
now, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. The
words of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You may
bury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, I
shall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded
Knee.

At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organ
refrigeration a speciality. Or something like that.

MANAGEMENT:
LIQUID THERAPY FOR THE NEW YEAR

   By LUCY KELLAWAY

Ihave not been myself recently. Not since I filled my body with a
strange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incident
was quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feeling
sheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild on
the mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginary
and that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.

The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warren
offered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. She
said this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deep
relaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfway
round the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing to
try anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, that
clinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping as
well.

Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There was
an unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and she
looked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle as
hot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to put
you under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and tried
to relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feel
your calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It is
soothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel your
knees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. It
is moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.

When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine it
scrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving them
in much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn household
stains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told to
picture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean and
emptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,
better able to cope and happier.

Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as a
brush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do not
believe in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort of
stress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or to
go on holiday.

So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45
minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe coloured
fluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge of
hysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circus
in the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.

Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism story
they give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started on
a slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubious
management gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are not
so sure. We shall see.

1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. A
replacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant's
latest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like this
new fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of one
syllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companies
should work out what changes to their business need to be made, then
they should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they should
assess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put them
right. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going about
things, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell it
out to them.

In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to be
undergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses do
not have their best interests at heart.

Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,
employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always have
done. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe their
company is well managed, or think that their bosses make the right
strategic decisions.

The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers now
view their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of values
for the company, less good at living by those values themselves.

I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions for
others, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it not
be time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? I
used to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, in
particular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I am
not so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughts
it would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is the
problem.

MANAGEMENT: TEGE - FAST TRACK

   By IAN RODGER

Why not start the new year by acquiring a share in Tege, the Swiss
company that is developing a french-fries vending machine?

That's right, insert a Pounds 1 coin, wait about a minute and out pops
a fresh, hot portion of french fries. Well, almost. The vending machine
is still in the prototype stage and unlikely to be on the streets of
Europe until next spring.

Nevertheless Tege's shares soared to a high of nearly SFr74 (Pounds
41.50) on the Geneva Stock Exchange last May, valuing the company at an
impressive SFr68m. They slid recently to SFr48 after it became apparent
that the planned launch would be delayed by about six months.

The machine - or rather the french fries production system - is the
brainchild of Richard Sorensen, an American inventor. Sorensen joined
six European investors, including Jacques Hennessy (of the Cognac
house) after an initial association with a US venture-capital company
turned sour.

They claim to have put about Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) into the venture
to date. Early last year they reversed into a derelict quoted Swiss
funicular company, Tege, and transferred all the patents to it.
Together they hold 55 per cent of Tege's 920,000 bearer shares.

Patrick Bigger, a Swiss who is chief executive, said they chose a Swiss
incorporation because many of the institutional investors in the
project are Swiss and wanted a Swiss franc share. Operations, however,
are based in England, where a three-month market test with 25 machines
is scheduled to start next March.

The problem with producing french fries is that the fries quickly
become soggy. Thus a vending machine can only work if it makes a fresh
portion every time. Sorensen's solution is to use potato powder.

Once an order is made, a given amount of powder is measured and mixed
with water to achieve a dough-like substance. The dough cube is pressed
through an extruder into french fries which fall into four steel
baskets in a pot of hot oil. The baskets revolve slowly around the oil
pot and a minute later tip the fries into a chute where they fall into
a cardboard sleeve.

The clever bit, claims Bigger, is the composition of the powder, which
contains patented additives that make it form into a perfectly
consistent dough within five seconds. Any dough left lying about
quickly reverts to harmless dry powder.

The oil is kept at 220'C, well below its boiling point, and is
frequently stirred even if no orders are being taken. It is also
automatically filtered and topped up for losses that go with the fries.

Tege executives are now setting up licensing and marketing arrangements
in many countries and spinning out creative sales and profit forecasts.
In one projection, 1999 net income comes in at SFr92.9m.

They plan both to sell and lease machines and supply the magic powder.
A machine will sell for about SFr15,000 and revenue and earnings
projections are based on portions being sold for Pounds 1, DM1.50
(Pounds 0.67), FFr4.50 (Pounds 0.58), or SFr1.80. They assume the
average machine will sell 50 portions a week.

The company needs another Dollars 6m or so to cover its costs until
revenues start flowing in. A convertible bond issue is the most likely
route, says Bigger.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE - IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN
AFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

On paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgent
businessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.

He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delano
hotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractive
than the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand on
nearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superior
variety.

Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allows
aesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off the
profit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his three
New York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them into
the hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wants
something different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who can
afford four-star or five-star establishments but find them rather
boring.

The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -
are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular that
last month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotels
by saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is now
renovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a site
in London.

The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.
He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclub
that he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio
54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980
Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for tax
evasion.

After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, and
diversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,
but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point in
opening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the business
was well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and the
Carlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course at
Claridges. You can't beat that.'

They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort of
people who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and were
willing to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventional
luxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune with
their taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.

They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154
rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, the
French designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegant
modernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice of
designer for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to the
flamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starck
again on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotel
that opened in 1990.

Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is the
most audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton but
cannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schrager
ensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)
between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 for
Morgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an average
occupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industry
average of 71 per cent.

'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running an
hotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclub
sells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. The
only thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the same
with hotels.'

Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom he
collaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderland
garden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to work
with. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team of
architects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas and
bring them in on budget.

'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' says
Schrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' This
system has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of the
world's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requests
a month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.

All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are specially
commissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for the
Delano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-room
Paramount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will be
easy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leave
the rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' He
says it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventional
chintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.

His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-built
as a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, who
says he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols of
colour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artist
James Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for the
foyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'

As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areas
such as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on room
rental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.
Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one of
Manhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with pop
star Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.
'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 a
month. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makes
Dollars 4,500 a month.'

The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager will
then expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London without
success, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte could
create some opportunities.

'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,
Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn't
open hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enough
people to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17
rooms as I would into one with 700.'

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTS


More than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign by
Bangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as part
of an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.

In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinely
flout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and are
swiftly on their way.

Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailand
the largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent of
Bangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent in
New York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.

Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Some
foreign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spend
less time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to the
traffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, a
billionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected last
July on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in six
months or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching with
no noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.

However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars
150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its traffic
problems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government of
Thailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressing
environmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which to
date have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'

For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's first
Cyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-loving
after-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of
10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.

Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of women
clicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your link
to true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk from
New York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took a
closer look.

The Cyberpub is in the same ownership as the local upmarket Dusit Thani
hotel chain.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CARRIERS CUT FARES


British Airways is cutting fares to almost 100 destinations until
January 17 as part of of its World Offers. The largest saving, Pounds
358, is on return flights to Harare, with prices starting at Pounds
599. Fares to Nairobi start at Pounds 439, down Pounds 356. BA fares to
Australian cities Darwin and Perth will be Pounds 561, saving Pounds
161 on the regular lowest fares, with Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns,
Melbourne and Sydney prices cut by Pounds 124 to Pounds 699. USAir has
reduced its everyday advance purchase ticket prices for spring and
summer travel by up to 44 per cent. The move came a day after a flurry
of winter fare cuts of up to 50 per cent initiated by Delta Air Lines,
which was swiftly matched by most of its competitors.

Italian air traffic controllers have signed a new wage agreement,
ending their long fight for more money, a union official said. The
accord will give controllers a 6 per cent salary rise for the period
1994-95. More talks will be needed to hammer out a settlement for
1996-97.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
AIRPORT ON TRACK


Hong Kong's new USDollars 20bn airport project, including
infrastructure and reclamation, is almost half finished, the government
said yesterday. At the start of last month the 10 core projects were 46
per cent complete.

Billy Lam, director of the new airport's co-ordination office, said the
project, which will replace congested Kai Tak airport, was on schedule
and within budget. Seven of the projects are government-funded.

'Our target remains that the first planes will be flying out of Hong
Kong's new international airport at Chek Lap Kok in April 1998 and I am
confident that the total cost will be within our budget of Dollars
20.3bn,' Lam said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
CASH IN THE SKY


A high-tech business partly owned by a former Israel Air Force
commander has miniaturised the technology needed to recognise
banknotes, and introduced a product it hopes will turn aircraft into
flying banks.

Inflight Financial Services is negotiating with Israel's El Al airline
and US-based carriers such as United Airlines and Delta to install its
Aero-Cash automatic currency exchange machine on regular flights.

The company has developed a way of reducing bulky automatic exchange
machines to a lightweight, suitcase-sized package that easily

operates on aircraft, it said. Company president Mony Lichman said the
machine, which exchanges US dollars and seven European currencies for
any other money, 'will become a fixture on airplanes and change the way
travellers bank'.

United Airlines said it was considering using Aero-Cash on its flights
but had not yet finalised terms. The machine accepts credit cards and
will charge no commission, Lichman said.

Inflight Financial Services is a multinational company partly owned and
managed by Israelis. Some of the development work on Aero-Cash was done
in Belgium.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
AIRPORT THREATENED


Russian airport police intervened last week to prevent a group of
businessmen from taking control of the VIP lounge at Moscow's main
international airport.

Anatoly Koryakin, director of the Sheremetyevo-2 airport, said the
businessmen had appeared in the lounge with a bailiff and police in
what seemed to be a property dispute. Some were armed with Kalashnikov
automatic rifles.

'Thanks to the intervention of airport security officers, order was
restored and work on receiving official delegations continued,'
Koryakin said.

MEDIA FUTURES:
POBOX AND THE MAGIC COOKIE

   By TIM DICKSON

Which company will have the greatest effect on the development of the
Internet this year? My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is
a tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if it
were an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the single
word 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service that
is an electronic equivalent of a post office box.

The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail address
ending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of this
column. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at that
address, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a data
base and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.

This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that is
independent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internet
access. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matter
of sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address and
quoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer's
authenticity.

I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recently
moved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I have
switched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, and
messages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me in
California without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.

Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential users
includes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only an
indecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.

Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersome
length or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mail
address.

The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at the
University of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: Reuven
Bell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, a
computer science major born in Singapore. The two launched their
service in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping with
the principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off by
giving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting three
months.

Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 a
year, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for the
price of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.

Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enough
for customers to become comfortable with the service and to give their
new e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyone
to find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.

So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost half
have been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell and
Wong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indications
are promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internet
newsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,
only one of which was negative.

Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early to
predict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time off
from his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planning
to pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,
the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see the
potential in its idea.

Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It would
remove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to stay
with an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com's
success would make a large global industry significantly more
competitive.

Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the following
story by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafe
of a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give it
out,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered to
pay for the recipe.

On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge it
to her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was then
handed the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visa
statement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.

The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinking
that the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told there
was no mistake.

The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford the
recipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,
but the woman got her own back in the end.

She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all her
friends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.
'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'

I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mail
would behave in such a pig-headed way.

But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of the
Internet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people may
have baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.
And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computer
screens all over the world.

MEDIA FUTURES:
HOME SHOPPING TAKES A TUMBLE FROM ITS TROLLEY - ENTHUSIASTIC PREDICTIONS
OF A COUCH-POTATO FUTURE WERE PREMATURE

   By WINSTON FLETCHER

A funny thing has happened. Home shopping, that supposedly
trail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of its
supermarket trolley.

Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato future
for us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surf
the stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into the
rough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We would
click-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filled
by techno-magic.

Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?

The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual home
shopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offering
merchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -
mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.

The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspicious
of the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,
highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 per
cent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, the
return rate is about 40 per cent.

A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, said
in a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particular
channel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction of
the number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running a
shopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some system
developers and their software programmers assume that consumers are
itching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.
Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture to
say that the great American public prefers just to watch television and
let someone else do the work.'

In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - a
publication understandably keen to embrace almost anything and
everything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped age
of online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of Trend
Letter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant to
solicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal account
numbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means been
resolved.

Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases were
made in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until you
remember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per cent
of America's population. And Americans, particularly those living way
out nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketing
has always been big business in the US.

It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke it
doesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubber
grommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just be
switching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers being
inveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.

Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.
At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europe
carried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demand
for home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' it
proclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goods
electronically.'

The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC started
with a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at about
Pounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channel
and supply some 300,000 customers.

Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, I
suspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.
Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In a
virtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up a
pack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It sounds
so futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing it
would be wonderful. But would it?

It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we all
know what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is that
virtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.

We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best
- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important single
sense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.

As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is why
they put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake their
own bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If you
don't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the old
costermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling the
produce).

Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is least
real. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projecting
huge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will convey
even a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried to
major in aesthetics.

But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,
or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? If
people didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose the
freshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tesco
stores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you want
to inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot at
one stop?

Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter among
the marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (The
marketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in selling
it, anyway).

Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom is
nigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different models
on-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,
even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.

The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motorists
than printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,
comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroom
visits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.

Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to be
taking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -
the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financial
services.

As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, they
are ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providers
increasingly use direct response television advertising
cost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described as
virtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.

Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will be
slow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Many
people, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.
Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticated
computer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,
computer-illiterate kids.

Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.
Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their own
version of the information superhighway (and with at least as much
hyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and the
telegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as new
media so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldest
advertisements in modern times.'

By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores had
mail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping by
telephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.
Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pin
to an elephant' door-to-door.

And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to its
customers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers a
cornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, delivery
was often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would be
today.

Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't bet
my Tesco shares on it.

MEDIA FUTURES: CYBER SIGHTINGS

   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN

Kicking off this US presidential election year, the Doonesbury Town
Hall site (www. doonesbury. com/ main. html), based on Garry Trudeau's
consistently brilliant strip cartoon, looks a fine way of keeping tabs
on the campaign as it unfolds. The site (slogan: 'Join the fight
against cluelessness') has a daily news briefing and links to the
PoliticsUSA resource, as well as a chat hall and a straw poll. Top
notch.

As access increases to the former Soviet Union and eastern and central
Europe, the Prague-based Open Media Research Institute (www. omri. cz) -
a successor to Radio Free Europe - offers useful resources including a
daily digest of economic issues affecting the region.

A new site from United Airlines (www. ual. com) is an example of how a
primarily corporate marketing site can be user-friendly and
informative. Very well done, nice graphics, not too much text per page
and easy to navigate around.

The Taiwan Business Directory (http://business. com. tw) is a searchable
guide to products and companies from Taiwan. It's indexed by company
name and, comprehensively, by product classification. There are eight
contact entries alone under the heading Food and using the sub-category
Soy Sauce.

Empower (www. megalinx. net/empower) is 'Black America's Magazine for
the
Information Age', with a newswire, articles about the affirmative
action debate, and a good business profile feature, focusing on
African-American achievers.

SPORT:
GREEN TURNS DARK FOR THE STRUGGLING GOLF CLUB PRO

   By KEITH WHEATLEY

Peter Alliss recently observed that the average club golfer expects the
local professional to play like Nick Faldo, teach like John Jacobs and
be as good a shopkeeper as Marks and Spencer.

Very few club members realise how much of an endangered species the
non- tour golf professional is about to become, especially in Britain,
the home of golf. Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainer
from his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment and
giving lessons.

Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossible
as the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chain
stores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.

'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry the
stock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' says
Haydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll see
them turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have had
the chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chain
stores.'

Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from the
specialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outlets
supplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to
300 shops within a year or two.

'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,
head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 a
year and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind of
volume.'

His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, with
a matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro has
two options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take a
big loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'

Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realised
he was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has a
high-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plus
a management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.

Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business
'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 average
turnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'

His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but a
branch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.

'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer to
replacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British are
the worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to take
instruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'

He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blasted
across the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the Professional
Golfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500
members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking the
raison d'etre of the pro.

It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional is
Nick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year away
from the everyday work of the pro at the local club.

When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it found
Faldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of the
game's better-known amateurs.

Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved in
the process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insider
put it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are never
going to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and now
they're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'

Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're all
failed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could play
and was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, and
I've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds
8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel course
in the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.

Leisure management and course architecture are much more important now
than learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headed
driver for a tiny fee.

The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to a
degree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for a
tiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' says
Walker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managing
the facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beverage
specialists or greenkeepers.

'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and work
the local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'

If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We may
not buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around his
club shop's over-stocked shelves?

'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are already
moving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be selling
all the clubs and equipment. A starter's hut where you can buy a glove
and a ball - if you've forgotten to bring them - is the most likely
outcome.'

ARCHITECTURE:
YEAR OF THE MILLENNIAL RE-THINK

   By COLIN AMERY

At least 1995 ended on a note of pure wisdom. For once, the old English
system of independent representative groups of well-informed
individuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs worked
brilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worth
their salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for the
proposed Cardiff Bay opera house.

For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have been
led by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of the
designs of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposed
opera house.

The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and her
commissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is not
supported by the people of Wales and is already dated.

A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera is
a good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. The
mistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to build
something approved by a narrow segment of the international
architectural mafia.

The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,
seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece go
ahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid is
really a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avant
garde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled
'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy London
chatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seen
for what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a briefly
fashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.

The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failure
of Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.
It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far through
endless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part of
the proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of the
trendies.

Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses in
the world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone with
experience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.
Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case she
and her commissioners are right.

Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK's
architectural profession. The turnover of the British construction
industry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to the
millennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some
90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.

Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects only
beginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.
The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedly
recognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,
to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixed
developments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entire
planning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably be
re-educating the entire planning profession at the new University of
Greenwich.

He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,
since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, has
abandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile of
offices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, and
the decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board on
the Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming a
horizontal version of Canary Wharf.

The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, giving
Mitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,
London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museum
of London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, and
why not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren's
wonder?

Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.
Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to the
new Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.
Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and Richard
MacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by the
public.

That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the public
are under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you and
me - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow in
formaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand the
difference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogma
and fashionable nonsense. I live in hope.

ARTS:
MAN OF MUSIC WITH PERIOD APPEAL - ANDREW CLARK TALKS TO THE CONDUCTOR
WHO CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OPENS OUR EARS TO THE PAST

   By ANDREW CLARK

This looks like Roger Norrington's year. He opens and closes it in
Salzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month and
returning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997
festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the London
Philharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,
Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -
not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrument
orchestra, the London Classical Players.

Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the period
ranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him from
most early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills to
unravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner
- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No British
musician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears to
the past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the international
limelight.

He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not about
period instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit of
mind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would still
be the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of music
without taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, finding
what the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'

Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspired
his singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as music
director gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of how
a company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'
weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform a
composer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues to
permeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.

'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way the
music is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra after
Norrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazingly
lively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,
the music really took off.'

Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. He
has had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,
the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travel
with him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict and
demanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertible
idea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music written
by real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wants
to get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,
remove the waffle and ballast.'

That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a high
profile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has only
recently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-German
heartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they're
sinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to the
idea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my rough
German, the orchestras have been very responsive.'

Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar at
Cambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with a
couple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the London
Philharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with modern
instruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of the
published scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, the
tempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, it
already makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,
they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we drop
the vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result was
absolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you're
not going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a real
musician.'

Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in the
early 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performing
Schutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had to
invent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemann
and Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubert
and Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and the
results astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.

In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knocks
two to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keep
thinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the same
things to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagner
would sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be a
big question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music on
these instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,
Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, it
lasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will it
sound like if we do that?'

It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with a
spring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results in
Bruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the Linz
Bruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the one
Bruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out by
his pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner's
own recorded comments, which include references to a polka in the
finale.

'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Bruckner
says it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,
which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomes
singable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believe
in the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as an
innocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringly
obvious things.'

Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:
'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I do
it. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're in
constant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to follow
what the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal you
may find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it should
be. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'

For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival in
Pesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management was
keen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,
cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. He
doesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasing
than he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-century
style. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and met
Beethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethoven
is fully classical.'

Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visits
Prague in May to give the first historically aware performances of
Smetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to the
Festspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. He
wants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'
weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger in
the opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, with
which he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historical
staging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The material
is all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'

Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is a
hazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong at
times - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of his
performances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.

TALES FROM ARABIA - THEATRE

   By SIMON READE

There is no better place to tell a spell-binding story than in the
theatre, especially around Christmas, when we are at our most
childlike. This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre's
ambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christian
fables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,
it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition of
Persia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales of
Sheherazade.

The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find it
re-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyard
arcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms from
king's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plains
between Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'This
hot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful of
sand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction and
Liz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicated
company of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'

It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides after
only one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.
He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered his
first queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,
the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, and
volunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister a
bedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. So
she tells him more.

The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Baba
and the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop the
proto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfully
murdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sex
and childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. This
interpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as one
riddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues a
clear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of the
women. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.

There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richly
interwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does not
only reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.
Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.

At the BAC, London until January 7 (0171-223 2223).

TODAY'S TELEVISION

   By MARTIN HOYLE

Local heroes (7.30pm BBC2) is a little hymn to English eccentricity,
both in style and content. Adam Hart-Davies is a one-man store of
trivia (or general knowledge as it used to be called in less ruthlessly
mercenary days) about inventions of the past including laughing-gas (I
always thought invented by Humphry Davy out of sheer boredom with
Bristol; eminently likely) and a spanking-machine.

For those who remember Richard Harris' play Outside Edge, first on
stage then on television with the incomparable Maureen Lipman, the
sitcom with the same name has been something of a disappointment. Its
characters verge on the caricatured and lack that consistency that even
sitcom creations should have. Still, a show that avoids aping American
comedy and even takes cricket as its theme is worth a plaudatory
chuckle (8.30pm ITV).

Great Ormond Street continues its gripping survey of the great
children's hospital (8pm BBC1); and Wild Britain (8pm C4) is a repeat
about the bramble bush and its dependent wildlife.

AN ABSENCE OF INFLATION: THE FEELGOOD FACTOR IS SET TO REMAIN ELUSIVE
IN 1996

   By MARTIN WEALE and GARRY YOUNG

By most measures, 1995 was a good year for the UK economy. Inflation
remained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemployment
declined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit by
less than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basic
rate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentage
point.

This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by British
historical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, there
are risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.

The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is the
virtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time of
relatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly a
reflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labour
market. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases have
shown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. This
means that the benefits of increased productivity have been
appropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:
profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in
1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.

One important question in present circumstances is whether the
surprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by the
Treasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the
1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per cent
of the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5
per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which was
only squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the last
recession.

Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increase
in wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per cent
to 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflation
of 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests that
unemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.

It would be premature, however, to assume from this that the
sustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costs
picked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing in
October at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects the
stagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. But
it may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching its
sustainable level.

If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possible
for output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlying
trend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does not
guarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by the
end of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domestic
prices has been offset by increases in import prices arising from
sterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.

We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to be
slightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say that
we think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflation
target. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantially
higher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domestic
prices.

This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears to
have stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that the
overall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This time
last year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for
1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For
1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than the
Treasury's forecast of 3 per cent.

Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will be
offset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.
Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to see
higher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.

We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This is
partly due to the very slow growth in wages.

There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will be
lifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion that
spending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears about
employment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behaving
perfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 per
cent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for
1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boom
period of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a binge
like that of the late 1980s.

In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall in
claimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of the
labour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration of
benefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this will
be consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rate
of increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,
but there will be no great pressure on them.

The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker than
expected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintended
build-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demand
for British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weaken
further and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintain
the economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.

In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. The
improved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightly
faster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from the
recent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stable
macroeconomic environment established since sterling left the European
exchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8
per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be an
economic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from the
years of stop-go.

Martin Weale is director of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, a UK research institute, and a member of the
Treasury's panel of independent economic forecasters. Garry Young is a
research fellow at the institute.

NEITHER BOOM NOR BUST: CONDITIONS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR SHARPLY LOWER US
INTEREST RATES

   By STEPHEN S. ROACH

The financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seems
to be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that the
US economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is heading
dramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve is
expected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,
with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, most
forecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.
Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the glorious
bull market of 1995.

Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of these
presumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domestic
product is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -
essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy's
underlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growth
surprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid support
from three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (at
present running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which are
near historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).

In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to show
surprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest rates
down about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in the
residential construction sector should continue well into the new year.
And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom in
capital spending.

This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacular
productivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisingly
immune to the whims of the business cycle.

Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflecting
the combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diverse
trade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unit
volume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to
10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespread
fears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish global
economy.

The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditional
trading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per cent
of overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of
1990.

Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastly
exaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I do
not share the widespread conviction that households are being dragged
down by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses to
income stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit in
the latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buying
binge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through
1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of real
GDP growth.

The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue to
believe the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remains
intact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly moving
up from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per cent
in 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a little
more acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 per
cent.

I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulk
of the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of an
extraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity and
corporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 per
cent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,
I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choice
but to capitulate further on wages.

In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,
this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. The
days of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble cause
of disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash from
workers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impact
on the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.

As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than an
aggressive monetary easing is now at hand.

Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for a
further dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bank
may offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But if
market expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates were
realised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to the
wind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and I
believe it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away from
the restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.

The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is still
business as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is a
plan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,
immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (for
example, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation and
declining interest rates continues forever). I have come to the
reluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave us
Gramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard at
work today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not a
certainty.

Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.
Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chance
that a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-
mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent
is possible.

But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conform
to market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bonds
is back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such a
correction to take place by mid-year, at the latest.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANT


Sir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports that
British Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account of
subsidies that the Irish government is to provide.

In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies from
the taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant in
Alabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership with
an American and a Japanese company.

Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - the
state legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and its
two partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plant
will directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in other
parts of the country.

Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, we
find it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies in
Europe and so ravenous for them in the US.

Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind of
tilted playing field.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNARE


Sir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting for
a kinder kill', December 13). The trap research compound near
Vegreville is a ploy that illustrates how far the Canadian government
and the fur industry will go to preserve this barbaric industry.

The fur industry professes to champion Canadian native people, but it
has been the most destructive force in their history. It has exploited
them, their culture and their way of life. Native people do not
process, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industry
chain.

Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadian
native people, the Canadian government and the fur industry are
promoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically central
to the native people.

Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerage
and water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than the
average among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not had
a high school education.

Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems. It will
perpetuate them.

Sir, I feel that your front page article 'Che beer leaves Cubans
foaming' (December 22) is unfair. The project was created to help Cuba
export beer, modernise its brewing sector and draw attention to the
US's embargo of the island.

Che beer's success is due to its distinctive taste and CCC's effective
marketing campaign. Unfortunately, some people have chosen to undermine
our efforts by stirring up controversy.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
DIAGNOSING MIDDLE-CLASS ANGST


Sir, In his otherwise excellent article on middle-class insecurity
('Bang go the great expectations', December 27), John Plender is surely
incorrect in claiming that an occupational pension is 'not an asset at
all'.

For the great majority of members of occupational pension schemes, the
pension is tied to the salary earned during the years immediately prior
to retirement and is unaffected by whether or not the company pays its
full contribution in every year.

It is certainly true that the benefits could be improved were
pension-fund surpluses to be used for that purpose, but the basic
payment is secure and does indeed form a substantial asset for the
pensioner.

The whole point about personal pensions, which yield direct ownership
rights, is that whereas the benefits are not tied to salary, and may be
much greater than under an occupational scheme, the risk element is
also much greater and hence the pensioner cannot rely upon the size of
the asset.

It is most unlikely that members of occupational pension schemes are
overly concerned about being 'disenfranchised', although they most
certainly detest those 'bosses' who manipulate their own pensions for
personal advantage.

Insofar that 'frustrated expectations' are the cause of 'middle-class
angst', it is not negative equity which is of direct concern since, as
John Plender notes, this has affected relatively few middle-class
households, but rather the possibility of falling house prices.

This is a very new phenomenon, and often accompanied by great
difficulty in achieving a sale, but it has no parallel in respect of
occupational pensions since their value is unknown prior to retirement.

OBSTACLES FACING THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY


Sir, Martin Wolf's piece on whether democracies are growing in number
and influence, and to what extent democracies are less warlike than
autocracies ('Mightier than the sword', December 28) reminds me of
discussions 30 years ago on whether history moves inexorably in the
direction of communism, and to what extent communist governments would
decrease international tensions.

There are indeed powerful 'forces that are driving countries towards
representative political institutions', but there are equally powerful
forces undermining democracies from within. Democracies have been voted
out, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich and
poor will not weaken many democracies.

It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourish
democratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society has
sustained democracy for longer than 70 years. There is nothing
automatic about progress, and nothing inexorable about the direction in
which history will go: that will depend on the choices each of us
makes.

LEADING ARTICLE:
WHEN POLITICS REPLACES POLICY


Britain's general election campaign is under way in earnest. The
defection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss Emma
Nicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragility
of Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentary
majority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defections
could soon eliminate it entirely.

Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the last
possible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on the
support of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote of
confidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may well
succeed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,
ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer be
certain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now a
real possibility if not yet a probability.

The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the message
of Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory last
summer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents by
speaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.
Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has been
deserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo among
voters.

Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservative
activists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the less
committed voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blair
has learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections are
not won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.

Gruelling business

Either way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling and
unedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these days
for policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. Mr
Major's legislative programme is designed above all to minimise
controversy within his own party and to highlight areas of difference
with Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflicting
tactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expecting
Labour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to be
disappointed.

As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble for
votes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for a
moment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.
Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower public
esteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.

Wider developments

It is true that wider developments have contributed to a general
weakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' national
problems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits of
economic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europe
has robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge such
trends is not to exonerate the politicians.

The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harsh
realities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.
The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises and
performance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,
the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,
the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutions
to complex problems.

To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the right
levels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shameless
mendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfect
public services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growth
will allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax rates
promised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare state
pledged by Mr Blair.

It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways so
close to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence in
parliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive of
democracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will be
the losers.

LEADING ARTICLE:
ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCY


For the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of the
European Union has fallen to a member state whose government is
severely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming a
bad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election in
mid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidential
elections last May. The Spanish government in the past six months
managed to postpone its demise in order to complete its EU
chairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.

Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has a
government. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday after
completing his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wants
him to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italian
parliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clear
agenda for Europe.

Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinate
their plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay the
groundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmental
conference this year, which would mark another important step towards
the goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumbling
towards that target in a familiar state of muddle.

Spanish achievements

Admittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rather
more in the past six months than one might have expected from its
political weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,
albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists would
like. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint for
the launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme to
reinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And it
organised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cement
better co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.
Not bad for a lame-duck administration.

The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,
is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appear
over-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of national
priorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. A
successful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;
agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The former
should be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficult
negotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peace
initiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces tough
domestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.

Difficult issues

There are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which require
clear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months those
include the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of the
Tacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; and
reform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure for
agreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour of
member states after creation of economic and monetary union. These are
all issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which a
weak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alone
negotiate a deal.

A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeable
future. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:
under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a result
much different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is right
to urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on a
programme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted by
a broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
former prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhat
unrealistic.

Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another six
months, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing the
constitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in the
interests of Italy and Europe.

EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEW
RULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESS
WHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BE

   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPER

This morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the Swedish
Stock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the first
time, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell shares
in Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'We
can sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we were
in Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.

The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a product
of the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), which
takes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands of
broking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and is
accompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes fresh
capital requirements.

Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - by
December 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessary
legislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening faster
than previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far more
complex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'
says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities and
Investments Board.

And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets will
be far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investment
banks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms and
exchanges.

There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. The
first is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,
provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outside
their home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct of
business devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.

For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the
'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.
However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference to
their operations. Although there have been instances of member states
imposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have been
able to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained about
crossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive
vice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.

But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation for
securities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for the
first time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they are
operating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely to
lose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out local
business for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers will
have to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.

The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges and
futures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasing
volumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond market
transactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allow
brokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.

The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32
securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,
the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivatives
markets, plans to extend its electronic network to several other
countries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,
which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-based
Deutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly with
Frankfurt.

It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as these
pressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, the
Paris-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with some
derivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.
'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futures
and options exchanges in Europe,' he says.

Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network with
the Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year which
would allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the same
screens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.
'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new big
bang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.

One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likely
to be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,
which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares for
purchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested a
large amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems have
won back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.

But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularly
London - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.
NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges rather
than on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base in
London. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's role
as the physical location from which traders operate by electronic
means.

Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London Stock
Exchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.
Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,
but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely to
become concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten this
process,' he says.

The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely to
be felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the first
time to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adverse
movements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At the
moment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risks
under the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.

The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor their
risks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. For
example, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limited
in most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can only
be exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banks
are best placed to comply with such demands, having invested huge
amounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitor
their exposure.

Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot large
exposures across the business is a significant headache for many
players,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capital
markets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level of
integration that only the top few players have.'

In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some banks
having to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believe
that the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, banking
analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for most
the impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some banks
will be able to operate with less capital than before.

However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavily
involved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directive
rules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investment
banking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,
according to Mr David Band, chief executive.

But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest in
upgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements to
monitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spent
up to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firms
face minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band says
there has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on bank
systems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.

As the directives come into action this morning, the immediate
beneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly trade
across European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.
In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,
many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,
less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find a
role as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasingly
integrated.

OBSERVER: NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUN


What will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raising
from the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Not
so long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it is
the smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil its
ambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 global
investment banks.

Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a well-known
Wall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,
or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. In
October it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-old
US mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his name
running Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggest
hostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune by
selling out to NatWest.

As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of being
taken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,
Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperately
needs to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants to
compete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.

Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must be
hoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.
After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executive
in 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securities
to secure Craven's services.

The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked for
Morgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a good
five years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive record
in the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for less
than Gleacher?

Surely not. Once again NatWest may have to make do with second best.

There are lots of other good guys, such as the chief executives of

Whether Buxton deserves a knighthood after 33 years with Barclays is

EU STATES SLOW TO ADOPT DIRECTIVE ON INVESTMENT: ONLY SEVEN COUNTRIES
READY FOR CROSS-BORDER REFORM

   By ANDREW JACK, ANDREW FISHER, ANDREW HILL and EMMA TUCKER

   PARIS, FRANKFURT, MILAN, BRUSSELS


Only seven of the European Union's 15 member states were ready to
implement the Investment Services Directive when it came into effect
yesterday, the European federation of stock markets reported.

The directive is designed to allow non-bank investment groups to carry
out several activities more easily across borders.

It aims to create a 'passport' system allowing an institution regulated
in one EU country to operate in all the others without having to comply
with additional requirements.

Stock market officials in some countries say they have restructured and
are ready to meet the requirements of the directive but their
governments have not yet passed the necessary legislation. Other
governments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.

Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposes
met the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republic
of Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.
In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to be
passed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected to
introduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greece
and Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.

Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enabling
legislation for the directive to push through broader financial
regulatory reforms, which has held up progress.

There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Paris
derivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,
but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.

In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the Federal
Supervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up only
a year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance with
stricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect of
the directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to open
offices in other countries than to change the location of where
transactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of those
markets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particular
security.

Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,
said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shift
to other markets if his country's institutions did not invest and
modernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why they
will have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.

The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks for
investors because institutions receiving their passport in the country
with the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtain
recognition elsewhere.

'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outside
Europe are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'
said one stock market official. 'The strength of the whole will rely on
the standards imposed by the least experienced regulator.'

THE LEX COLUMN:
GOING FOR GROWTH


It is perfectly reasonable to feel sanguine about the prospects for the
world's main financial markets in 1996, but it is difficult to get
excited. Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may have
slowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the US
economy's soft landing looks convincing enough.

But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,
inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. The
resulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelled
advances in stock prices.

Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace is
slowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds and
stocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looks
rather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per cent
last year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earnings
are not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth does
not necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looks
expensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yields
are low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.
The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,
but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.
And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, for
example, has still to be thrashed out.

THE LEX COLUMN:
EUROPE


A correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefited
most from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely to
continue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growing
possibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majority
dwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on to
power until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of his
control over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by the
stock market.

The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,
given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise in
consumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such as
housebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further rate
cuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in the
second - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating of
the economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election would
hardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice as
much as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitters
could cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.

Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock market
prices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains it
makes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above its
current level, are probably sensible.

In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodes
well for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,
there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs that
the structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budget
deficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds and
other European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -
the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,
so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute price
movements.

THE LEX COLUMN:
JAPAN


Tokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, just
below 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fund
managers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few markets
have performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained
37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over that
period has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.
Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economic
recovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.
But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leading
market set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revival
and a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, on
top of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.

On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, with
the index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high even
by Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to the
Nikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,
Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, well
below the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavy
net sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bonds
in 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recent
pessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.
They may be right.

THE LEX COLUMN:
EMERGING MARKETS


Emerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound is
already overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects the
crisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market at
the start of the year. In fact, international investors had little
reason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. US
fund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns in
their own domestic market.

But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.
As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domestic
market, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.
Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there are
still good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of the
dire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. The
main bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, which
would suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly by
emerging markets standards, makes stock markets relatively
unattractive, given the associated currency risk.

Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strong
economic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefit
from funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.

PENSION FUNDS RAISE RETURNS BUT MISS OUT ON BIG US GAINS

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

UK pension funds recovered from their poor performance in 1994 with
investment returns averaging 19 per cent last year, according to a
survey by the WM Company.

Pension funds benefited from a return of almost 24 per cent on UK
equities, which make up more than half of their portfolios.

But they missed out on the big gains in the US stock market, which
returned 33.8 per cent last year. Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bn
of funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.

'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but it
really took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, which
specialises in performance measurement.

He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension funds
demonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured over
five years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of
15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.

'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go on
producing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and
1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 per
cent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.

Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.
Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 property
produced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for all
other sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns have
averaged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of total
pension fund assets at the end of the year.

WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,
reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despite
widespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with more
fixed-income investments and less equity.

Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension funds
are maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and more
receiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdings
to provide a more guaranteed stream of income.

But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios in
equities last year compared with 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.
Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, also
increased, but only to 9.9 per cent.

'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bonds
hasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.

CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY

   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent

Reform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which was
introduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amid
fears that some companies may be inadequately covered.

The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried that
businesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which are
forcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or risk
having to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.

Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of those
businesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase full
terrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurance
companies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover the
cost of an incident from other resources.

However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:
'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enough
terrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fears
could intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.

Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industry
about possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurance
company. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurance
companies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.

Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercial
insurance providers - have to supply terrorism insurance on fixed
terms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used to
pay any claims. If Pool Re ran out of money, the government would make
up the shortfall.

Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates have
fallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible and
expensive.

Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policies
would include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,
allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terrorist
attack.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK):
CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS - UK RETAILERS

   By NEIL BUCKLEY

Expect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers make
their January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmas
accounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports of
a buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales have
breathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in the
autumn.

Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -
Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a total
sales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, while
Next is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increase
reported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per cent
increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, over
Christmas.

Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strong
performances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnished
slightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle home
decorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightly
up, but like-for-like sales down.

The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer are
forecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent. At House of
Fraser a like-for-like increase of perhaps 3 per cent is expected.

One year after the poor trading statement that sparked the departure of
four directors, Kingfisher is expected to reveal recoveries in
Woolworths and Comet, but falling sales in Darty, the French electrical
chain.

WH Smith is forecast to report a Christmas sales increase of up to 7
per cent in its interim results on January 24, while Burton, at its
annual meeting the following day, is expected to announce a continuing
improvement in sales and gross margins.

NEW LOOK RETAILER SOLD TO INSTITUTIONS FOR POUNDS 170M

   By TIM BURT

New Look, the privately-owned fashion retailer founded by entrepreneur
Mr Tom Singh was yesterday sold to a venture capital buy-out group for
about Pounds 170m.

Mr Singh, who started the company in 1969 with a Pounds 5,000 loan, has
agreed to sell the 323-store chain to institutional purchasers led by
BZW Private Equity and jointly underwritten by Prudential Venture
Managers.

The sale follows New Look's abortive attempt to come to the market in
October 1994, which it abandoned the day before its scheduled flotation
amid fears it would not raise the estimated Pounds 150m it was seeking.

Under the terms of yesterday's deal, New Look's shareholders -
dominated by Mr Singh and his family trusts - will initially receive
about Pounds 105m in cash and shares worth about Pounds 50m in Vallsar,
an investment vehicle set up for the transaction.

That will leave the Singhs with 25 per cent of Vallsar, which is to be
renamed New Look. BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds
15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years to
March 1998.

Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,
said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 months
to March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 in
France, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.' He
claimed New Look - advised by J. Henry Schroder - was Britain's most
profitable specialist women's wear retailer. In the year to March last
year, pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 15m
on sales of Pounds 141m (Pounds 83.4m).

Its rival Etam, by comparison, reported first-half losses of Pounds
3.85m in the autumn, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m.

Mr Graeme White, a director of BZW Private Equity, praised New Look's
operating performance and said the existing management would remain.

Mr White has joined an enlarged board of New Look as a non-executive
director, as has Mr Martin Clarke of Prudential Venture Managers. He
said the two backers had no timetable for an exit, but did not rule out
a fresh flotation attempt.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK): GREENBURY GUIDELINES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST
- OTHER COMPANIES

   By WILLIAM LEWIS

The Greenbury committee's report on executive pay
will move into the spotlight in January and February, with the
publication of a consultation document and several companies' annual
meetings held under Greenbury rules for the first time, writes William
Lewis.

Next Monday, a consultation document on possible methods for disclosing
the true value of directors' pensions will be launched. The Faculty of
Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries, together with the Stock
Exchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, are to send the
paper to public companies and are seeking their views by February 9.

The Greenbury committee's report, published in July, recommended that
pension costs be disclosed to shareholders to reflect the value to the
individual as well as the true cost to the company.

The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries put forward a
preferred method but there were calls for wider consultation.

Many companies feared that directors' remuneration could appear to
increase by startling amounts under the new code. The consultation
document will include a number of options - including allowing for the
'smoothing' out of the effects of Greenbury.

Other Greenbury recommendations have already been put in place by some
companies and are due to be tested at annual meetings in the next few
weeks.

Bass and Burton, in their annual reports sent to shareholders last
month, were the first companies to give a separate remuneration
committee report on executive pay. Both companies' remuneration
committee chairmen will be answering shareholder questions on pay at
the meetings on February 8 and January 25 respectively.

Greenbury also recommended that companies seek shareholder approval for
new long-term incentive schemes. Burton and Capital Radio on January 17
will ask shareholders to vote through new schemes for executives.

Following the rule changes announced in the November budget regarding
the taxation of executive share options, Euromoney and Berisford are
asking shareholders to approve changes to their executive share option
schemes. Berisford's meeting is on January 22 and Euromoney's is on
January 18.

US investors are looking forward to some good news this month as most

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off

per share totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32
in 1994, a rise of nearly 20 per cent.

FORTE TO EXPAND THROUGH MERIDIEN

   By DAVID BLACKWELL

Forte, the UK's biggest hotels group, is planning a further 26 Meridien
hotels in a push to expand internationally.

The move is expected to be announced in today's final defence document
against the Pounds 3.3bn hostile bid from Granada Group, the
television, catering and leisure group.

Forte is also likely to promise a special dividend or share buy-back if
the Pounds 1.05bn sale of its roadside businesses to Whitbread goes
through. Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and Happy
Eater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas and
Travelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The deal
is conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.

The document is expected to include a promise to increase annual
dividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 31
1993 and were last raised five years ago.

The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, has
revalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over
10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representing
net asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the Savoy
Group, which Forte plans to sell.

The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increase
had been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assets
would have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like a
bit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief
executive.

Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels from
Air France just over a year ago in order to give it a bigger
international presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, one
is in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut and
Bangkok.

Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not been
ruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.

Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would be
overseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,
and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.

'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much more
pro-active.'

Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, giving
details of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 per
cent to group operating profits.

Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including the
Georges V in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected to
account for 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotels
accounting for 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) and
Heritage traditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 per
cent and 20 per cent respectively.

LONDON BRACES ITSELF FOR A REPO REVOLUTION: AN OPEN MARKET IN SALE AND
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR UK GOVERNMENT BONDS STARTS TODAY

   By RICHARD LAPPER and PHILIP GAWITH

Dealers in UK government bonds are today braced for one of the biggest
changes in the City since Big Bang 10 years ago.

The introduction of an open market in gilt repos, agreements to sell
and then repurchase government bonds, will allow all participants in
the market to borrow and lend stock, removing the monopoly over such
activity that a select number of firms have long enjoyed and bringing
the UK market into line with practices in the US and France.

The Treasury and Bank of England hope the changes will make it easier
for investors to trade gilts, increasing their attractions to overseas
investors and ultimately reducing the cost of funding government debt.
But in the longer term, the development of repos could also lead to
broader changes in the structure of the UK's short-term money markets
and in the way that the Bank of England manages liquidity.

'I'm not saying that repo is going to take off overnight but it is the
brave new world,' says Ms Una van Dorssen, director of repo marketing
at NatWest Markets.

In simple terms, a repo is an agreement to sell a security and then
repurchase it at an agreed future price and date.

One party to the deal 'borrows' money, using the security as a
collateral. The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,
in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession of
valuables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo looks
like a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequent
acquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by either
party.

And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complex
economic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos to
fund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed as
collateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to finance
their operations as they do not have access to the interbank markets
where banks lend to each other.

At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in a
similar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,
although in this case they have the additional security of holding a
bond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be used
to meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealers
frequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when they
feel prices are likely to fall.

In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lend
government stock through stock lending agreements has been restricted
by law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. In
addition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20
securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to
'short' the market.

The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much wider
range of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'The
fact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make it
attractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They no
longer see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says Mr
David Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.

Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquid
underlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo's
development will increase the range of strategies open to traders.

The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also be
significant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and should
help to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack of
short-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnight
market, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by a
small group of players.'

Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amounts
of money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.

And in the short term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,
dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,
offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.

Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt to
the new environment.

Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock on
their books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems and
learn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-term
investments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-term
money market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers may
prefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with money
brokers.

In the long term, however, dealing directly with other dealers and
investors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. Mr
Simon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money market
operators will respond to repo in a similar way to how British
motorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.

'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed for
more traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.'

DISNEY AIMS TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which recently bid Dollars 19bn
(Pounds 12.2bn) for the Capital Cities/ABC television company, plans to
strengthen its presence in the music business.

It is believed to have joined forces in the autumn with PolyGram, the
world's largest record company, in an attempt to sign up Janet Jackson,
the US singer. Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her in
the hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in the
music market and attract other acts.

Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson would
have split her recording contract between the two groups. She would
have signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGram
subsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of the
world.

It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract with
Virgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since
1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UK
leisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram just
before Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with Ms
Jackson.

Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, which
is one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of the
entertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's music
interests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six years
ago.

Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number of
highly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.
The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold more
than 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in the
marketplace.

One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attract
high-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fierce
competition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternative
would be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,
which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI group
next autumn. But Disney could face fierce competition from other North
American companies.

MEDIOBANCA TO GIVE FERFIN OFFER TERMS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME


Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, is expected to reveal
shortly the terms of its public offer to buy 158m shares of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company that controls the Montedison
industrial group.

The move has been forced upon Mediobanca after it lost two judicial
appeals against a public offer for an amount of shares equal to those
acquired in an October raid to gain control of Ferfin. The completion
of the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,
with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).

Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchange
watch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with the
regional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with the
higher court of the state council.

Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among these
has been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came well
after Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.
Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per share
represented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid on
Ferfin.

But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; and
Consob announced only shareholders on the register before the issue
could be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer. This point is
apparently being questioned by Mediobanca's lawyers.

Analysts also pointed out that by being obliged to acquire 15 per cent
of Ferfin, the outlay represented over 10 per cent of Mediobanca's
assets, a large exposure.

HEALTH GROUPS ABANDON MERGER

   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK


After a busy year of consolidation, the US healthcare industry ended
1995 on a sour note with the formal dissolution of a Dollars 1.6bn
merger that would have created the country's largest managed care
organisation.

WellPoint and Health Systems International, two Californian healthcare
groups, abandoned a merger agreement reached last April. Friday's
development came two weeks after the two organisations announced they
were in discussions to break off merger talks, and follows indications
that executives from each side were unable to reach agreement on how to
share power in the new company.

The merger would have created a West Coast giant with the financial
muscle to acquire other managed care groups around the country. The two
had listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a key
reason for the combination.

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systems
would have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.
However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree on
what role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.
The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-held
public company than either is at present.

VICTORS AND VICTIMS OF BOARDROOM UPHEAVAL - TIM BURT LOOKS AT THE HIGH
NUMBER OF COMPANIES STARTING THE YEAR WITH A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP

   By TIM BURT

An unprecedented number of Britain's leading companies are beginning
1996 with newly-installed chairmen and chief executives following a
year of boardroom upheaval.

Groups such as BAT Industries and Inchcape have new chairmen, while
British Telecommunications, BTR, BOC, WH Smith, and electronic
components manufacturer Bowthorpe are among those to bring in new chief
executives.

Their arrival - mostly part of a smooth succession - comes after a year
in which other high-profile directors became boardroom casualties,
including Lord Young and Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive
respectively of Cable & Wireless.

Mr Tiny Rowland left Lonrho after losing his long-running battle with
Mr Dieter Bock, the trading group's chief executive. Other departures
included Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Richard
Reynolds, a director of GEC; Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive at
Calor Group; and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley.

Russell Reynolds, the UK's largest headhunter in revenue terms, said
the number of arrivals and departures reflected the growing influence
of institutional shareholders and non-executive directors in bringing
in new management.

'We're seeing a trend that when companies are having a very difficult
time the executives are being brought to account,' said Mr David
Shellard, managing director.

He cited the Cadbury committee on corporate governance as one factor
behind the increased turnover among company directors, while adding
that the Greenbury committee on executive remuneration had focused
shareholder attention on performance-related pay.

Heidrick & Struggles International, the London-based executive
recruitment agency, said the rash of outside appointments also
signalled a growing skills shortage at board level. Mr John Viney,
chairman, said: 'There are simply too few people to go round. So we're
seeing the best, such as Sir Colin Marshall, taking on two or three
roles.'

Sir Colin, chairman of British Airways, yesterday became non-executive
chairman of Inchcape, the international marketing and services group.

'Inchcape has not been in the best of health,' Mr Viney added. 'They
know it's much better to have a top-class person - even if only for one
day a week - than someone less effective,'

Among the other new arrivals this month, Lord Cairns, who last year
resigned as chief executive of SG Warburg, the investment bank, becomes
chairman of BAT Industries.

Mr Ian Strachan succeeds Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive of BTR. Sir
Peter Bonfield, knighted in the New Year honours, moves from computer
group ICL to be chief executive of BT. Mr Bill Cockburn has become
chief executive at WH Smith.

Mr Tim Parker is taking over as chief executive at CJ Clark, the
shoemakers. Mr Nicholas Brookes is the new chief executive at
Bowthorpe. And BOC, the industrial gases group, will mark its annual
meeting later this month with the appointment of Mr David John and Mr
Danny Rosenkranz as new chairman and chief executive respectively.

NATIONWIDE LOOKS TO LIFE OPERATION

   By ALISON SMITH, Investment Correspondent

Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, is looking to its
new life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries, which open today, to
enable it to reduce its dependence on mortgage-related financial
services.

The new operations replace the relationship in life assurance that
Nationwide has had with Guardian since the beginning of 1990s.

Mr Tom Boardman, managing director of the two new subsidiaries, said
that whereas in selling Guardian's financial services about four-fifths
of Nationwide's business was mortgage-related, he hoped that within a
couple of years this could be reduced to about half.

This strategy seems to acknowledge that endowment mortgages are
becoming less popular and that any recovery in the housing market over
the next couple of years is unlikely to match the pace of the 1980s.

Nationwide has also set itself the target of winning 70,000 financial
services customers in the first year - about 1 per cent of its total 7m
customer base.

This is more ambitious than the 40,000-plus financial services
customers it is thought to have gained each year during the six-year
tie with Guardian.

The new life company will sell term assurance, a mortgage endowment
policy, a guaranteed equity bond and a personal pension plan. The unit
trust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and a
balanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.

Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will also
sell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, the
healthcare company.

This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies which
Nationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforward
nature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed the
range was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.

For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up their
own financial services businesses, a key element will be to market
these products to the entire customer base - savers as well as
borrowers.

Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will be
made up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end of
February. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with the
remainder available to visit customers.

FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE

   By ANDREW JACK

   PARIS


Credit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, is
considering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while it
undertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.

Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking a
loan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would last
about three years.

Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-term
ways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by the
withdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housing
loan schemes.

The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuring
programme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little as
the next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some of
its central Paris offices.

However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies so
they are likely to extend the length of their programme to at least
three years.

They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawing
from activities such as loans to property developers and local
authorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low and
middle-income housing projects.

Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has been
tightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharply
and its credit rating has fallen.

It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock market
regulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed merger
with its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.

The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boost
to its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving a
recapitalisation.

The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in the
medium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like its
private sector competitors.

Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, the
government appoints its chairman or 'governor'.

INTERNATIONAL COMPANY NEWS:
HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION - SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST
FAMILY-RUN 'CHAEBOL' IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES

   By JOHN BURTON

Mr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside over
the gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrial
group his father established in 1947.

That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wants
it. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire after
his death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it among
several of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most of
Hyundai's 45 companies to them.

The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groups
within Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.

The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transfer
of management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother Chung
Se-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.

Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, could
serve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. The
chaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficient
while fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication of
activity.

Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of their
marginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrial
sectors to improve their global competitiveness.

Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve these
goals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, and
these units are less able to support unprofitable activities than they
were within the old monolithic structure.

Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was divided
into six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of Mr
Chung's sons and nephews.

The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by Mr
Chung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son of
the Hyundai founder.

In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargo
container company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precision
now produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utility
vehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospace
sector, assembling aircraft and satellites.

Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wants
to expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai's
car and shipbuilding operations.

Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, has
developed Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producers
of computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, Mr
Chung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggest
in Korea.

Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group's
crown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, the
brother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has been
appointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.

Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has been
named new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refining
companies, another growth area.

Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house and
construction company, remain under the control of the group founder.

A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since the
group is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,
however, should weaken as the government imposes limits on
cross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominance
of the chaebol.

Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up of
Hyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basis
that Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, who
have created their own small industrial groups that partly depend on
Hyundai for business.

Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motor
vehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.

Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry grows
between the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, is
challenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles and
mini-vans.

A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult to
push through large projects that were once easily tackled under the
autocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.

Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundai
chairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steel
mill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries as
unnecessary.

NETSCAPE LEADS THE FASHION FOR US NEW ISSUES - FT WRITERS LOOK AT THE
BEST PERFORMING SHARES AROUND THE WORLD IN 1995 / BEST AND WORST SECTORS

   By Our New York staff and ANDREW FISHER

   FRANKFURT


New issues - if you could lay your hands on them - were the hottest
performing stocks in the US last year, with Netscape Communications,
the Internet company, racing to the fore, writes our New York staff.

The market for initial public offerings was more active than it had
ever been, but the few sceptics that remained claimed this was a sure
indication the US market was way out in front of most traditional
valuations measures.

Netscape, which produces a browser for the Internet, was floated in
August at Dollars 28 a share, and by year-end it was trading at Dollars
139, having reached a peak in early December of Dollars 174.

Other strongly performing new issues included Pixar, which handled the
animation for Disney's latest hit film Toy Story. It floated at Dollars
22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached a
high of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back to
around Dollars 28 7/8.

Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led the
market higher for much of the year, although towards the end of the
year many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor sales
slowed.

The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains in
other sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gains
made bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.
Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 per
cent.

Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,
managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stock
market sector.

Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended another
difficult year with a disappointing Christmas.

CONSTRUCTION FALLS

Building sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurt
skyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in
1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performance
slumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,
improvement.

By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,
adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of its
aggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,
the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performance
has been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.

Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,
estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise a
mere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercial
and homes building boom is now over, with public sector construction
also held back by budget constraints.

Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to perform
in line with or better than the overall market this year include
motors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.

The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 points
after it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. A
year ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higher
than expected pay rises threw out its calculations.

For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects an
overall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in
1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industries
should show steeper rises, it says.

Further markets will be covered
over the following days.

THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED

   By TIM BURT

The largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed the
engineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposed
Pounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.

Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinary
shares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders of
Thomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant value
inherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve a
scheme that will lose them control.'

Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urged
shareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by the
issue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares. He also condemned as
inadequate a proposed 3-for-10 scrip issue of additional ordinary
shares, designed to compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of
voting rights.

The dissident shareholder, advised by KPMG, said there was no logic for
Thomas Locker in acquiring Pentre, which he claimed was burdened with
Pounds 6.9m borrowings.

Neither company was available for comment.

MARKETS:
ANXIOUS EYES FOCUS ON COPPER - COMMODITIES

   By RICHARD MOONEY

London Metal Exchange dealers returning from their festive break today
will be anxious to ascertain the new year mood of the copper market,
which is likely to set the tone for other base metals contracts as
well.

Last week's lightly-traded inter-holiday period ended with the copper
market close to its 1995 low as stocks soared towards the excessive
level at which they ended 1994. At 296,425 tonnes they were more than
double the July low.

With further rises in stocks expected, analysts and traders were
predicting further falls this week. '(Stop loss selling orders) were
triggered below Dollars 2,665 earlier today,' one trader told the
Reuters news agency on Friday afternoon, 'and more are likely to be
lurking below Dollars 2,650. . . copper is back on shaky ground.'
Several analysts forecast that copper would drop to Dollars 2,500 in
the medium term as new production capacity came on stream and stocks
continued to accumulate.

The steady increase in stocks over recent weeks has been encouraged by
big premiums available for immediate delivery at the LME. As the stocks
have risen these premiums - known as 'backwardations' - have narrowed.
'If stocks keep rising, and we do expect they will, then the spreads
should come in even more,' Adam Rowley of Macquarie Equities told
Reuters.

'At some stage in the first quarter of 1996 we are looking for quite a
sharp fall in copper prices,' he added.

'With February/March at Dollars 80 to Dollars 90 backwardation it looks
as if this period will stay tight,' said Wolfgang Becker of Iceni
Commodities Brokerage. 'Obviously at some stage the whole thing will be
reversed, but this sort of stock rise may be a bear trap.'

Options traders told Reuters prices could overshoot downside targets if
hedging against large put (selling) positions below the market gathered
pace. 'We are just waiting for copper's resilience to end and when it
does the market could collapse,' one said.

ASSESSING THE POWER OF MULTINATIONALS - GLOBAL INVESTOR

   By TONY JACKSON

   NEW YORK


A noisy debate has broken out in that quiet retreat for the weekend
reader, the book review section of the New York Times. It revives an
issue which some might have thought buried: the power of the
multinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of free
trade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannot
be taken for granted.

The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr Francis
Fukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteran
leftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current social
malaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered by
large corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, the
powers of government should be increased to control them.

Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed by
Mr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.
Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by big
government.

Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion Mr
Ralph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,
export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers and
the environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rots
from the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he will
never understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.

So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becoming
part of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that free
trade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blame
the multinationals as its agents.

As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish and
destabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruelly
ravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but the
erstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.

As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, Sir
James forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.
On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr Pat
Buchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.

On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables bad
environmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -
again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countries
free from costly environmental controls.

Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-trade
governments and big business can point to one central fact. As the
chart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly in
relation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previously
grown in line.

But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Last
year, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortune
magazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales of
Dollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.
The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.

But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be more
powerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of trade
barriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour and
capital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:
put the barriers up again.

It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politically
unstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet the
genie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.

Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successful
investor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade is
not intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would be
perfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Single
countries could not do it, but groups of countries could.

Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which he
regards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. The
last comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. In
those days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and had
an interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent a
gunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainly
not the US.'

Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the time
being, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's US
presidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professed
free traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessions
to their respective outer wings.

The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull market
contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told that
multinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greater
productivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation of
markets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does not
entail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Free
trade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.

This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, which
were able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is another
matter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,
modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl
4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.

Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market argue
that the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enough
to last for a generation. The question is what that generation will
make of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could be
the first casualty.

MARKETS:
TIME TO REWRITE INFLATION TARGET - ECONOMICS NOTEBOOK

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Over the last five years many countries have adopted formal targets for
inflation as the centrepiece of their economic policies. But turning a
vaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numerical
objective is not as straightforward as it sounds.

For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need to
establish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to be
demanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are serious
about achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding because
credibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossible
to hit.

In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising three
objectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring
1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per cent
in the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from public
consciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,
however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changes
take about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late to
do much about inflation within the target period.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his Mansion
House speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent
or less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflation
between 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpected
events might push inflation higher when it was too late for
policymakers to react.

This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voices
have argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, the
permanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas that
the government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,
concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at the
Bank of England agree.

The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds of
City and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter than
its predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4
per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?

The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepened
the mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May that
inflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that he
should therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thought
inflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,
but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of the
target - 2.5 per cent or below.

But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predict
that inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, but
dropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,
its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied if
inflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. To
observers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring on
the side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except in
unavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.

But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitable
limitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstrated
by Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a study
published last month*. They constructed a model of British inflation
since 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a
2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis of
a forward-looking forecast.

The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variable
had the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.
But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possible
outcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole range
of unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.
They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been well
directed, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance of
hitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, these
results would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wide
as that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'

This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productive
to express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 per
cent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for even
a well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,
it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.

Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2
per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible to
hit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But it
argues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor for
private-sector expectations than a target range.

Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggest
that the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have a
point target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even though
that is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, the
chancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that it
reflects reality in a rather clearer way.

EMERGING MARKETS: HONG KONG - NEWS ROUND-UP


The Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options trading
in the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new options
during the review period.

The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exempt
from stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market to
spread risks.

The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bids
and how to increase the number of market participants, including market
makers

The exchange began listing individual stock options in September and
currently trades options on nine stocks.

EMERGING MARKETS: INDONESIA - NEWS ROUND-UP


Further state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automation
could mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,
brokers and analysts believe.

The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manual
operations in May, after long delays. This coincided with a move to new
premises in the central business district, and the extension of trading
by 90 minutes each session.

Brokers and analysts said the automated system had helped raise
efficiency and transparency and add liquidity. The fully automated
trading system would also provide a springboard for a planned move to
fully scripless trading, expected in the next few years.

The government is expected to list many of the more than 200 state
companies in the next few years.

EMERGING MARKETS: PHILIPPINES - NEWS ROUND-UP


The Manila equities market, which languished for much of last year, is
expected to rebound strongly during 1996 as more companies are listed.

The authorities expect the creation of a central depository, the start
of scripless trading and tighter rules to prevent insider trading to
boost sentiment.

Some brokers said they expected up to 30 companies to list.

However, inflationary pressures in the first quarter could be brought
about by an impending increase in domestic oil prices.

At present, about 200 companies are listed.

A central depository would begin operations for treasury bills and
government bonds in March before expanding to shares by the third
quarter of 1996.

EMERGING MARKETS:
TRADERS PIN HOPES ON DOLLAR - CURRENCY MARKETS

   By PHILIP GAWITH

If foreign exchange traders have their wishes granted, 1996 will be a
year of volatile markets. Last year was much better than the dismal
spectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the US
dollar trading in a very narrow range.

There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters about
the outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed to
confound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.

Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit in
the coming months from: perceptions that inflation has become
structurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficit
as a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.

They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in the
second half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round in
German interest rate expectations.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,
forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Against
the yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and current
account data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the big
bilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar's
favour.

Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that the
German economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark in
Europe, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy in
order to curb D-Mark strength.

Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affect
the dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe will
also be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.
The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,
could make life difficult for sterling.

EMERGING MARKETS:
LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS - THE EMERGING INVESTOR

   By JOHN PITT

The year just ended has not been one that investors in the world's
emerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look ahead
to the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.

But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what have
become known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.

Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (compare
this with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and an
annual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has an
average daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)

A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledgling
stock market at the start of last year would have seen
dollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this with
a loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in Sri
Lanka.

Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growing
interest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are just
beginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouring
to do so as quickly as possible.

As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,
for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into the
developed world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. In
particular, a race began among a number of US and European investment
banks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions in
Africa. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returns
on investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the more
mature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.

This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,
although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on the
continent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation of
Dollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stock
exchange.

Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996
will see this market come of age, especially after the presidential
election is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led by
Michael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe and
Russia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers are
ready to significantly increase their exposure.

'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity markets
in 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe and
Russia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per cent
of existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per cent
of the existing free-float.'

Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include an
improvement in custodial operations, with expectations that an
independent central depository will finally be created.

Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging Markets
Fund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that the
country's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before it
gets any better.

Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,
given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'
approach to financial market reforms.

But what of the core emerging markets?

Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & Colonial
Emerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of a
disappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remains
positive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,
as having strong prospects.

India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, he
says.

He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among Latin
American markets.

Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slower
economic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake on
the stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will be
very much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours the
food, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that the
recent decline in inflation means that many people now have a
disposable income for the first time in years.

At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea and
Turkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see an
improvement in the economic picture and political problems are forecast
to dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing in
monetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once again
now that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.

Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 per
cent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in the
IFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell at
James Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in Latin
America', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,
corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuing
the market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.

Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among the
world's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least the
movement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,
many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutional
money out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the Far
East.

EQUITY MARKETS:
INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATA - NEW YORK

   By RICHARD WATERS

Thanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock market
investors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic data
against which to judge the economy's performance.

The only significant new information this week will be the National
Association of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.
The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists to
be around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the
50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. That
would provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gains
have underpinned share prices.

While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix its
attention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.

Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helped
set the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This time
around, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US's
economic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.

Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.
But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty of
room for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with US
investors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of cash
around to chase share prices higher.

EQUITY MARKETS: STRATEGY - OTHER MARKETS


The start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendations
from brokers. Spain and Sweden feature among the lists as potentially
good performers in 1996 while the time may now be ripe to take profits
on Switzerland after its strong run last year.

Views on Italy are divided, with some analysts thinking the time is
right to give the market another chance but others finding the
political outlook still unappealing.

JP Morgan expects equity markets to remain volatile, with positive
responses to interest rate cuts probably offset in part by continuing
bad news on earnings.

Morgan reiterates its underweighting of Paris, saying France is
expected to experience one of the slowest growth rates in Europe next
year. It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss market
and switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discounting
the bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetary
policy.

Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interest
rate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recent
underperformance.

Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,
French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,
relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more than
discounted by the market.

Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while the
Dutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.

The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.
Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.
In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and the
Netherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market of
choice. And while Italy's valuations have improved, ABN still does not
trust the politics.

EQUITY MARKETS: TOKYO - OTHER MARKETS

   By EMIKO TERAZONO

With the Year of the Pig ending on a note of slight recovery, some
market participants are hoping that the Year of the Rat will be a good
one for the Japanese shares, writes Emiko Terazono. Past Years of the
Rat have seen the market rise by an average of 54.6 per cent, and the
animal is regarded by believers of traditional omens as a favourable
sign for investments.

Stocks may need all the help they can get since banks and life
insurance companies are expected to sell their share holdings ahead of
the March book-closing. Analysts point out that there has been heavy
trading around 21,500 and regard that figure as a strong resistance
level.

EQUITY MARKETS: HONG KONG - OTHER MARKETS


Further gains are expected among equities this week after Friday's
year-end window dressing and solid gains in the futures market, which
took the Hang Seng index to intra-day and closing highs for 1995.

Analysts are concerned, however, that the near-term outlook for
recently active newspaper stocks remains cloudy in view of their weak
earnings prospects. They add that the decision to relax conditions
governing the pre-sale of uncompleted flats will benefit developers,
although it will not have much stimulative effect on the local property
market.

EQUITY MARKETS: FRANKFURT - OTHER MARKETS


The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but having cut key rates at its last
meeting, no action can be expected on the discount or Lombard rates
this week.

James Capel says the Bundesbank Council will wish to assess the impact
of the monetary easing on M3 and the real economy over some weeks.

The most interesting feature of the meeting was likely to be what the
council said about the repo rate.

'We would expect a fairly prompt return to a variable repo rate, which
is likely to drift lower over the coming weeks,' says Capel.

On the corporate front, analysts are expecting a let-up in the number
of new bourse listings in 1996 after last year's flood, although
November will bring the flotation of Telekom, Germany's telephone
monopoly, which is expected to raise DM15bn.

Companies raised a record DM8.5bn in new funds in 1995 from 20 IPOs,
including the listing of Merck, the drugs group, that was Germany's
largest post second world war stock offering, which raised DM2.4bn, and
the Adidas placement, which raised DM2.1bn.

EQUITY MARKETS: DUBLIN - OTHER MARKETS


Even after last year's performance, which saw the Irish equity market
climb by 20 per cent to end among the best performing markets in Europe
for the third successive year, Dublin retains its enthusiasts.

Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin says the market has
more than doubled since the trough of October 1992 but still expects
the ISEQ to be among the top performing indices in 1996.

'Valuations remain low, both by historic and international standards,
the Irish economy is likely to be the fastest growing economy in in
Europe again in 1996 and the strength of corporate cash flows and
balance sheets is likely to restrict the supply of new equity to a
minimum,' he says.

How this better relative performance translates into absolute
performance depends on developments in other markets.

Mr Kelleher believes the international equity market rally can be
sustained in the early part of 1996, on the back of continuing support
from low interest rates, low inflation and rising bond prices.

EQUITY MARKETS:
YEAR EXPECTED TO OPEN ON POSITIVE NOTE - LONDON

   By PHILIP COGGAN

The UK market starts what could be a general election year in a healthy
spirit. A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions in
European and US interest rates, creates a positive background for
equities.

With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the early
months of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. While
the FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind Wall
Street's phenomenal performance.

The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not so
much for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements about
trading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profits
warnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth was
pausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.

As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of an
election, and the chances of a Labour government.

Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but on
micro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.
If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares may
start to come under pressure.

Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, a
strong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.
It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in
1996.

CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE - INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGS

   By ANTONIA SHARPE

The debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranging
international equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,
judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recent
competition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.

Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen a
consortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and four
Brazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,
one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.

The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrange
what is expected to be one of the most significant international equity
offerings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government's
stake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spread
over at least two offerings.

If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankers
involved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers had
offered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and another
including CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.

It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including Morgan
Stanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its fee
estimate was too far below the average) was in this region.

By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part of
the bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.

Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say the
level of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondary
offering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands a
higher fee.

Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the most
widely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it already
has a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.

They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,
where past international equity offerings have been done for fees of
just over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers give
to justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,
the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations in
Brazil.

Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holding
in one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m from
the whole process.

On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness among
international banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefront
of Brazil's privatisation programme.

The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in the
country's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next few
years.

The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrange
the CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risks
associated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflection
of the increasingly intense competition in the international equity
market.

Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees for
arranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been eroding
steadily over the past two years.

This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds of
selling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.

The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, where
there is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so on
corporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs that
corporate fees are also coming under pressure.

In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe and
elsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment banks
wanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels have
become one of the main bargaining tools.

With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe the
golden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, has
gone for good.

GOLDMAN SACHS REMAINS AT THE TOP

   By ANTONIA SHARPE

Goldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading global co-ordinator
of international equity issues in 1995, according to data from Euromoney
Bondware, Antonia Sharpe writes.

Goldman's involvement in Germany's
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November, should ensure
it retains the top slot in 1996. However, winning the CVRD mandate in
Brazil, which is also set to emerge in the second half of the year, has
increased Merrill Lynch's chances of taking the lead.

Although Morgan
Stanley, Merrill Lynch, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston, Dresdner
Bank-Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers remain among the top 10 global
co-ordinators for 1995, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Paribas and BNP have
been displaced by UBS, ABN-Amro and BZW.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
TOKYO

   By EMIKO TERAZONO

While the country's financial institutions' woes are likely to prompt
the Bank of Japan to maintain an accommodating stance in its money
market operations, it is expected to push up interest rates on the long
end.

Banks are expected to step up their profit-taking on bonds and stocks
ahead of the March book-closing in order to cover losses stemming from
the write-offs of bad loans.

Many of the leading banks have pledged to clear their balance sheets of
bad loans related to jusen, or housing loan companies, and some have
announced that they may fall into the red for this business year to
March.

Life insurance companies may also want to take profits on their bond
holdings due to the decline in insurance premiums. While the leading
insurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the first
half to September, this was largely due profit-taking on their
investments.

The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the March
book-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreign
exchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bond
prices.

Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year government
bond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 per
cent at the end of the first quarter of this year.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION - OPEN GILT REPO TRADING

   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPER

The launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something less
than a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step away
from a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,
towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a global
financial services industry.

The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core City
institutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchange
money brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.

Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwing
in the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an open
repo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.

Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is being
enthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - the
discount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone can
remember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank of
England channels liquidity to the commercial banks.

Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of having
employees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of the
City's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised in
recent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the money
markets.

More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank is
prepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held by
the clearers.

As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years has
been little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearing
banks.

There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England will
start to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the money
markets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, but
the bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).

This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth of
liquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number of
counterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to be
inevitable.

For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said this
week that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money market
operations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could make
it sensible to contemplate change later'.

The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of one
observer, 'any change is a sea change'.

A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible bills
in its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move to
sole reliance on repo is likely.

Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and bill
operations in tandem.

There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,
there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a more
effective method of managing short-dated interest rates than the
current practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the bill
market.

Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a future
single European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to do
anything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, if
it participates in monetary union.

A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business School
found that the money market operations of the Banque de France,
Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank of
England in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised only
repurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range of
financial institutions.

It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently in
the money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates were
much more volatile than elsewhere.

Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Intervention
via repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to make
overnight rates more stable.

Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discount
houses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of active
participants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of the
clearers.

The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new trading
instrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - a
high priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.

At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to the
discount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.

Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertise
in secured lending.

Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houses
have a head start because our job has been secured money markets since
the beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount market
is secured.

Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'This
is the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as a
potential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'

A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB within
the group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.
While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing and
lending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they have
will still count.

A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds and
institutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indications
are that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.

As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widen
their counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they have
traditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likely
to be the watchword initially.

Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England starts
to use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageable
set of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.
They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.

Another development which will encourage the development of the repo
market is the introduction of the European-wide Capital Adequacy
Directive, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a secured
money market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lower
than for unsecured ones.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
FRANKFURT

   By ANDREW FISHER

The German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,
with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.

Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economic
growth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after its
pre-Christmas interest rate cuts.

With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a further
reduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.

It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -
just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per cent
for six months.

Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.

'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'

The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current
3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,
since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.

If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interest
rates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discount
cut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
LONDON

   By CONNER MIDDELMANN

All eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on gilt
sale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.

'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,
buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem will
transform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.

'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos will
impact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays and
ultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'

But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected by
repos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have to
look elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.

The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasing
managers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.

'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumer
demand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter of
total annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi
International. 'The weekly notes in circulation data suggest that there
was a seasonally adjusted increase in M0 of almost 1 per cent on the
month - this would appear to confirm retailers' reports of strong sales
in December.'

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
INVESTORS ASSESS THEIR STRATEGY FOR 1996 - GOVERNMENT BONDS

   By RICHARD LAPPER

The scale of the rally in international government bonds over the last
six months surprised the markets and left many investors scrambling to
increase their exposures.

In assessing their strategy for this year, investors must weigh up the
extent to which benign economic fundamentals, especially for the US and
European markets, are already reflected in valuations.

At the same time, the markets could be affected by a number of
political uncertainties linked to the US presidential elections and the
creation of European Monetary Union.

European bonds provided investors with some of the best returns in 1995
- with returns (in local currency terms) to December 15 ranging from
around 15.3 per cent in France and 15.5 per cent in Germany to 19.3 per
cent in Sweden.

Over the last few weeks there has been a wealth of evidence that the
growth of core economies such as Germany and France is grinding to a
halt and that inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.

Furthermore, at their Madrid summit last month European leaders and
finance ministers reaffirmed their commitment to monetary union,
suggesting the reduction of fiscal deficits will remain a priority for
governments across the continent.

'Europe is shaping up for a common currency and that suggests
governments will wrestle to bring public finances under control. These
are developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr Craig
Shute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.

Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuries
provided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.
And the current market rally has very different characteristics to that
of 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.

During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -
now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. The
inflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analysts
argue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to the
extent of the downward trend in inflation.

Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at Yamaichi
International, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer price
index - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since
1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there may
be a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests Mr
Richardson.

Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by Consensus
Economics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent in
the longer term.

'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on the
grounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,
therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a background
of 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.

However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, the
scale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good news
is already reflected in valuations.

Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage points
in 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yields
on 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall of
more than 1.5 per cent.

'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cut
interest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bond
markets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, international
bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.

Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is a
high risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields rising
by 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also create
difficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,
in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria for
monetary union in some countries.

The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,
where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts to
reduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 per
cent.

The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expected
to have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.

Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,
it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'
stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 were
suddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.

A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZW
Securities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowings
on the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is small
relative to the yield pick-up.'

BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than European
bond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasury
curve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
NEW YORK

   By RICHARD TOMKINS

US Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologically
significant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. On
Thursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -
and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 per
cent at which it started the year.

The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and Wall
Street analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakening
of economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationary
pressures.

With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expect
the Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with the
next downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting of January 30-31.

This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for any
agreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budget
will almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of government
data to resume before the weekend.

Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers index for December. This is
expected to show a slight increase from November's 46.5.

FT GUIDE TO THE WEEK


UK gilt repo market opens

An open market begins in gilt repos, agreements to sell and then
repurchase government bonds. All players in the gilt market will be
allowed to borrow and lend stock, rather than only a select group of
dealers. The reform should provide greater liquidity, make the market
more attractive to foreign investors and reduce government funding
costs.

Cash for Marcos victims

About Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) of money from Swiss bank accounts
belonging to the late Ferdinand Marcos, the former president of the
Philippines, is to be transferred to Hawaii. The move is part of a
Dollars 100m deal in settlement of a Dollars 2bn claim by about 10,000
victims - or their relatives - who were tortured, raped or murdered
under the Marcos regime. The Filipinos filed a lawsuit against Marcos,
who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, after a popular revolt ousted him
from power in 1986.

AT&T targets Britain

UK phone-users can expect to find themselves the target of aggressive
campaigns by AT&T, the largest US telecoms operator. AT&T says it will
not compete on price but on quality of service and innovation. British
Telecom, which has so far brushed off challenges from its 150 or so UK
rivals, may have more to fear from the US giant.

Cricket

South Africa meet England in the fifth Test in Cape Town (to Jan 6).

Holidays

Armenia, Botswana, Canada, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, New Zealand,
Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Yugoslavia.

WEDNESDAY 3

Perry in Sarajevo

William Perry, US defence secretary, arrives in Sarajevo after
inspecting US bases in Italy and Hungary. Mr Perry is touring US
military operations to implement the Bosnia peace accord. It is the
first visit by a high-level US official since the deployment of 20,000
American troops began on December 16.

On Thursday, Mr Perry travels to Ukraine, where he and his Ukrainian
and Russian counterparts will participate in the destruction of an
intercontinental ballistic missile silo in accordance with the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

Summing up in Maxwell trial

The Maxwell fraud trial resumes following a Christmas break demanded by
the jury. The judge, Lord Justice Phillips, will start his summing up.
This is expected to last almost a week, after which the jury will be
sent out to consider its verdict. Kevin Maxwell, Ian Maxwell and Larry
Trachtenberg deny conspiring to defraud the Maxwell pension funds.

Holidays

Japan, Taiwan.

THURSDAY 4

UK's first war crimes trial

Committal hearings start in Dorking, near London, for what could be
Britain's first war crimes trial. The accused is 84-year-old Szymon
Serafinowicz, a former Nazi paramilitary allegedly involved in
atrocities during the second world war.

Japan's stock markets open

The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the country's other stock exchanges open
the year's trading session.

Holidays

Burma, Zaire.

FRIDAY 5

Britain's Blair in Far East

Tony Blair, leader of the UK's opposition Labour party, makes a two-day
visit to Japan on the first leg of a Far East tour (to Jan 8) to raise
his party's international profile and persuade foreign investors of the
soundness of Labour economic and financial policies. He will address
the Keidanren, the main business federation, and meet government
ministers and UK businesses in Japan. He travels on to Singapore.

German rail fares rise

Fares on Deutsche Bahn, Germany's federal railway system, rise an
average 2.8 per cent in western Germany. Train tickets in eastern
Germany, which used to be 20 per cent cheaper than in western Germany,
will now only be 10 per cent cheaper. The Schones Wochenende ticket,
which enables five people to travel unlimited mileage on local trains
for an entire weekend, will now cost DM35 (Dollars 25), up from DM30.

Mastering Management

The FT's 20-part series resumes in the UK edition with part nine,
following a two-week break. Non-UK readers can take out a subscription.

SATURDAY 6

Rifkind visits Hong Kong

Malcom Rifkind, UK foreign secretary, arrives in Hong Kong for a
three-day visit, his first to the colony as foreign secretary. He will
meet local business and political leaders and receive a briefing from
the governor, Chris Patten, on the state of Anglo-Chinese relations as
they affect the June 1997 hand-over of the colony. Mr Rifkind travels
on to Beijing.

Sailing

The Cape to Rio yacht race starts from Cape Town, South Africa.

MEASURES THAT CAME INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1 1996

Public procurement deal

Public sector procurement contracts worth several hundred billion
dollars a year were opened to international competition when a new
World Trade Organisation accord came into force. The 24 signatories
include the 15 members of the European Union, the US, Canada, Japan and
South Korea.

US bill on lobbying

A ban on gifts for politicians in Congress came into force. Senators
can only accept gifts worth less than Dollars 50, with exemptions for
home-state products and foodstuffs. House of Representatives members
are allowed nothing, although there are 23 exemptions including
home-state products, T-shirts and baseball caps. Lobbyists must
disclose full details of their activities.

Italy holds EU presidency

Italy assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union,
with the prime task of inaugurating the Inter-Governmental Conferences
(IGCs) on the future of the EU. The presidency risks being overshadowed
by Italy's political instability and a general election.

Lamberto Dini, prime minister, has argued strongly that he should
remain in office to ensure the government is able to concentrate on the
presidency.

Britain takes over WEU

The UK took over the presidency of the Western European Union, a
10-nation defence club. Britain has pledged to take a pragmatic
approach to upgrading the WEU, with some improvements in its capacity
to anticipate and handle crises but with no question of its
compromising Nato's role as Europe's main security institution.

EU-Turkey customs union

A customs union between the European Union and Turkey came into effect
with the removal of remaining trade barriers. This followed a vote in
the European parliament in December, in which the move was approved by
343 to 149, with 36 abstentions. There had been concern about Turkey's
human rights record.

EU finance directives

The EU Investment Services Directive, and the accompanying capital
adequacy directive, were both implemented. The directives aim to give
EU investment firms a 'passport' to trade in all member states if they
are authorised in one.

The CAD also introduces European Union-wide rules for banks and
securities firms to set aside capital to cover risks in securities
trading. These are in addition to international rules covering lending
risks run by banks.

Telecoms competition

Cable TV, utility, rail and other 'alternative' networks throughout the
EU were allowed to use their infrastructure to offer telecom services.
Mobile operators were permitted to build their own networks and
directly connect to other mobile operators.

French income tax rise

An additional 0.5 per cent tax charge was introduced on all revenues in
an attempt to correct the country's accumulated social security
deficit.

German tax changes

Tax cuts and other changes took effect which should leave Germans
nearly DM20bn (Dollars 13.8bn) better off this year. Tax-free
allowances were brought into line with poverty-level incomes, more than
doubling the level of income permitted before tax to just over DM12,000
a year.

Consumers will also benefit from the elimination of the 'coal pfennig',
which was previously added to electricity bills to help pay for the use
of German coal in power stations. However, these savings - amounting to
about DM27bn this year - will be offset partly by DM7.5bn higher
contributions to pensions and insurance funds.

Deutsche Telekom tariffs

Germany's state-owned telephone company, due for partial privatisation
later this year, introduced changes to bring its tariffs more in line
with market demands. Long-distance calls will become cheaper and local
calls, which have been kept artificially cheap for decades, more
expensive. Business clients can also choose from three different
discounts of up to 24 per cent.

British alcohol tax cut

The tax on fortified wine, such as sherry and port, was reduced by 12p
for a typical 75cl bottle.

UK copyright extended

Copyright on music and literature was extended from 50 to 70 years,
implementing an EU directive of October 1993. Although virtually all
member (and non-member) states adhered to the 50-year rule, the EU
followed Germany, where royalty payments last 70 years. Britain will
now be out of step with other English-speaking countries, which will be
able to produce cheap editions 20 years earlier.

The change is retrospective, bringing back into copyright works by
artists who died between 1925 and 1945, including the composers Edward
Elgar and Gustav Holst, and writers Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of
Sherlock Holmes, Kenneth Grahame, author of Wind in the Willows, Thomas
Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, DH Lawrence, and Beatrix Potter.

Income tax back in Cuba

Cuba, which abolished personal taxes as a 'capitalist evil' after the
1959 revolution, reintroduced income tax on hard currency earnings. The
government also introduced a tax on boats - whatever their size - and
road tolls on two highways leading to tourist centres.

SOCCER CLUBS IN EGYPT WINOVER TV FEES: GOVERNMENT PITCHES IN TO BOOST
ROYALTIES

   By JAMES WHITTINGTON

It was not quite the kind of negotiations Rupert Murdoch or Kerry
Packer might be used to, but for Egypt's football clubs earlier this
month it was quite something to score against the state television
monopoly.

Cairo's two most popular soccer teams last month banned state
television from broadcasting their matches after a row over royalties,
forcing the government to intervene in their favour.

The Egyptian government has long been ultra-cautious about allowing
market forces to unsettle the country's protected state sector. But
when it came to football, two senior ministers readily made the
necessary concessions.

In the Egyptian football calendar, the highlights of the season are the
matches between Cairo rivals Ahli and Zamalek.

These succeed in emptying the city's streets and push TV ratings way
past the most gripping soap operas.

Facing financial difficulties, the two teams astonished many Egyptians
by putting aside their rivalry on the pitch to take on the powerful
Radio and Television Union which for years has benefited from its
monopoly on domestic broadcasts by refusing to negotiate fees for
televising matches.

The clubs' financial problems began after the 1990 World Cup in Italy,
when the football federation urged clubs to turn professional and sign
contracts with players.

This led to fierce competition to sign the best footballers which
pushed up transfer fees and forced club directors to look more closely
at their finances.

In August, it became obvious that something had to give when Zamalek
paid a record EPounds 600,000 (Dollars 177,000) for Egypt's highest
goal scorer, Ahmed el-Kas.

'Faced with this kind of costs, to keep a first class team we had to
start thinking seriously about our finances,' explained Mr Adly
el-Kee'i, manager of Ahli.

'Before we just worried about winning our matches but suddenly we had
to think about our performance in terms of profits and losses. We
needed more income and the television rights seemed an obvious
candidate for change.'

At the start of the season in September negotiations between the soccer
clubs and the RTU on broadcasting fees were not going well.

The clubs complained that the fees, which are always paid to the home
side, were not only too low but also depressed gate earnings because
fans would stay at home to watch the matches live on television.
Demands for a better arrangement, however, were given short shrift.

'The (Radio and Television Union) is not a bank,' Mr Amin Bassiouni,
president of the RTU, was reported as saying. 'We are not responsible
for the soccer clubs' financial problems.'

On November 5, to break the deadlock, Ahli, the national champions,
took the unprecedented step of banning TV cameras from its matches.
Attendances rose three-fold, and the club said it earned more from gate
receipts than the previous television fee structure.

With the first goal scored, Zamalek quickly followed suit.

Caught offside and facing the wrath of Egypt's football fans, the
state-run broadcasters quickly called on the government to act as
referee.

The deputy prime minister, Mr Kamal el-Ganzouri, and the information
minister, Mr Safwat el-Sherif, were put on the case.

As the weeks went by and Ahli and Zamalek stayed off the screens,
football fans became more and more restless, with the local press
firmly in favour of the clubs.

With the pressure on, the RTU backed down, and the government stepped
in to provide the extra money.

A three-year contract which came into force on Saturday, will double
the clubs' earnings - EPounds 200,000 for matches between Ahli and
Zamalek and EPounds 150,000 for other matches.

'We're very, very happy, it shows we were right to stand up and fight,'
said Mr Ali Osman, chairman of Zamalek.

JAMAICA PONDERS AN ECONOMIC VICTORY OF SORTS

   By CANUTE JAMES

The custodians of Jamaica's truculent economy are celebrating a
victory, of sorts.

After 18 years of mainly acrimonious relations with the International
Monetary Fund, the island has ceased to be a borrowing member. With
foreign reserves covering three months of imports, government officials
are claiming that the new status with the IMF is a victory for the
administration's management of the economy.

Others are not so sure. The victory for Jamaica is pyrrhic, and the IMF
can claim a win in getting Jamaica to implement its structural
adjustment policies, say the government's critics. They point to
continuing currency instability and to billowing inflation. Businessmen
complain that high interest rates - a government tool for damping
demand and reducing pressure on the exchange rate - are driving them
out of business.

'After 18 years and being in a relationship with the IMF it must
reflect that we have managed effectively the macro economy,' said Mr
Percival Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'I am not concerned
whether the IMF will claim some credit. My greater satisfaction is that
the economic situation is such that we do not need to borrow from them
and that we can take our own economic choices in accordance with our
sovereign judgments.'

There are no victors in this, said Mr Delroy Lindsay, president of the
Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica. 'This appears to be a draw.
Jamaica has made progress in structurally adjusting the economy, but it
still has a far way to go. Inflation is too high, interest rates are
too high and there is little growth.'

Jamaica's relations with the IMF is a litany of repeated and protracted
negotiations, agreements reluctantly implemented by successive
governments because they were politically unpopular. IMF agreements
became synonymous with the deterioration of the economy as governments
fulminated against the Fund's conditions for the structural adjustment
of the economy.

But the end to Jamaica's borrowing from the Fund has not coincided with
any indication that the persistently wayward economy is settling down.

After 18 months of relative stability, the currency has depreciated by
16.5 per cent since July after a decline in foreign currency flows to
banks. The central bank was forced to intervene by selling from its
reserves. Economic expansion has been sluggish at just under one per
cent in 1994. Mr Omar Davies, the finance minister, says 1995 is likely
to have resulted in more of the same. 'Growth will not be spectacular,
but it will be positive,' he said.

Mr Davies rejects suggestions that the economy is stagnant. 'We are
having lower levels of growth than we expected,' he said. 'This is not
stagnation but low growth.' The finance minister has done the
unthinkable in Jamaican politics by publicly admitting to making errors
which contributed to the current uncertainty in the business climate.

The prospects for Jamaica are limited and clear, economists and
business leaders concur. A reversal of the deregulation would be
damaging. 'The government has done well in the macro-economic policies,
but its management of some aspects has been inadequate,' said Mr
Lindsay. 'Interest rates must come down, the currency allowed to find
its own level, inflation will be lower and all other things will fall
into place.'

OBSERVER: FOOD FOR THOUGHT


Hush. Egon Ronay, the Hungarian-born restaurant critic, has been
touring the eateries of Europe's four major international airports and
is not impressed. The great man, who penned The Unforgettable Dishes of
My Life, has collected more than enough material for a sequel.

Amsterdam's Schiphol comes bottom in Ronay's airport league table,
getting just one out of 10 for its catering quality. 'Anybody who eats
at Amsterdam airport needs to have his head and palate examined. It is
below criticism,' says Ronay. Paris's Charles de Gaulle is not much
better, scoring two out of 10. Frankfurt gets four out of 10, but Ronay
was still far from impressed.

Britain's Heathrow airport comes out tops, with the quality of its
chips and coffee getting a special mention. However, one word of
caution about the survey. Ronay was hired by the British Airports
Authority to undertake the exercise.

What's that they say about the customer always being right?

100 YEARS AGO: AMERICAN FINANCE


All the cables from New York reflect the feeling of relief which has
pervaded financial and commercial circles on the reported successful
negotiations for placing further Government bonds. Nothing could be
more significant than this of the low ebb to which the credit of the
United States has fallen. That it was a little better than had been
anticipated in some quarters after the publication of President
Cleveland's Message is not saying much. A workman who falls from a
scaffold may congratulate himself upon the fact that he has broken only
one leg instead of two, but the blessing is of the comparative order,
and the case of the United States is somewhat analogous to this.

The typical British car has limited passenger room, but is highly
suitable for British conditions, which are an amalgam of slow speeds,

adapted for the vast spaces of continental travelling and the
roughnesses of colonial roads. Meanwhile, the mass-produced American
car meets colonial and continental conditions admirably.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS MONTH): PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH TO LEAD TO STRONG
EARNINGS - US RESULTS

   By MAGGIE URRY

US investors are looking forward to some good news this month as most
companies start reporting their 1995 earnings figures. Throughout the
year, the quarterly numbers have produced pleasant surprises, with
results often beating analysts' estimates, writes Maggie Urry.

Corporate America has gone through rapid productivity growth in recent
years, which has meant that even in 1995, with profits rising sharply,
companies were still laying off workers and taking large restructuring
charges.

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off
charges. Forecasters expect the S&P 500 companies to announce earnings
per share totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32
in 1994, a rise of nearly 20 per cent.

Particularly strong earnings gains are expected from cyclical sectors
such as aluminium, paper and pulp, and chemicals. Also well ahead will
be technology groups. However, some of these, such as semiconductor
makers, issued warnings on profits for the final quarter as sales
growth weakened and prices came under pressure.

Weaker figures are expected from some of the consumer non-durables
groups, such as the tobacco and restaurants sectors. In February, poor
results are due from retailers.

ARGENTINE CONGRESS URGED TO SPEED LAWS

   By MATTHEW DOMAN

   BUENOS AIRES


The Argentine government is stepping up pressure on the nation's
Congress to approve key economic legislation early in the new year.
Legislators failed to vote on two important measures in extraordinary
sessions held this week.

Debate on the measures - a presidential request for additional taxing
and budget-trimming powers and a bill to advance reform of
federal-provincial government relations - was again suspended late on
Thursday evening after opposition members of the lower house of
Congress withdrew from the chamber. Their walk-out denied the chamber a
quorum and pushed consideration of the bills into January.

The government is now insisting that extraordinary congressional
sessions be extended as far as February to win approval of the measures
it argues are critical to repairing the nation's finances in 1996.
Argentina's Congress normally takes a long southern summer recess over
the months of December, January and February.

The measure considered to be the most important is President Carlos
Menem's request for extraordinary powers to cut expenditure and raise
taxes without congressional approval. The government argues that the
proposed 'superpowers' are necessary to ensure that the 1996 budget is
balanced and International Monetary Fund fiscal targets are met.

The second major measure, the ambitiously titled Reform of the State
legislation, aims to streamline financial relations between the
national government in Buenos Aires and the country's 23 provinces.

The federal government argues that elimination of duplication of
services in the two tiers of government could save up to Dollars 1.5bn
a year but is reluctant to confirm that efficiency measures may see the
loss of up to 20,000 state sector jobs.

The congressional backlog was cleared somewhat earlier this week when
the upper house of Congress, the Senate, approved the 1996 budget law
and a hotly debated measure to increase taxes on tobacco products.

Argentine financial markets have maintained a firm tone in thin
holiday-season trade this week, and investors appear content to give
Congress some additional leeway to approve the government-sponsored
measures.

Economist Raul Buonuome of ING Barings said the markets were willing to
accept that the Senate might not sign-off on the measures until March
but had expected lower house approval this week.

ISRAEL HAILS 'CONSTRUCTIVE' ATTITUDE FROM SYRIANS

   By PATTI WALDMEIR

   WASHINGTON


Israel and Syria yesterday extended negotiations into the weekend as
the two sides took cautious steps towards peace in informal talks at a
secluded venue where they were able to start to form the sort of
personal relationships essential to any peace deal.

Each side sent three negotiators to the talks, held in the elegant
ambiance of the Aspen Institute's Wye Plantation conference centre
outside Washington.

Mr Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry and a
crucial negotiator of the Israel-Palestinian peace accord, headed the
Israeli team. The Syrian chief negotiator is Mr Walid Moualem,
ambassador to Washington and a confidant of Syrian president Hafez
al-Assad. They were joined by four representatives of the US
government, whose presence is viewed by both sides as crucial to
mediate a deal. That team is headed by Mr Dennis Ross, state department
Middle East co-ordinator.

Convinced secrecy is essential to progress, all parties imposed a news
blackout. But an Israeli embassy spokesman in Washington stressed the
'positive atmosphere' of the talks.

'Very good personal contacts' were made, with negotiators from both
sides holding 'a lot of small talks' in the corridors and when they
dined together.

Given the intense distrust which exists between Israel and Syria any
improvement in the atmosphere must be progress. And Israeli sources
noted a new, more constructive attitude from the Syrians.

Analysts point out that the intentions of President Assad are
notoriously difficult to decipher, as he seldom travels to the west and
runs a closed and secretive government.

But they believe he may have concluded that the time is now ripe for
peace.

The assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin has
highlighted the strength of the anti-peace movement in Israel, which
may persuade Mr Assad that his best interests lie in making a deal with
the current Israeli government rather than having to deal with a
future, potentially more hostile one.

Mr Assad is also keen to remove Syria from the list of countries denied
certain economic benefits from the US because of their alleged support
for terrorism.

SUBSIDY WILL HAVE TO EXCEED DOLLARS 300M: NUCLEAR PRIVATISATION:
DECOMMISSIONING MAY LAST MORE THAN 100 YEARS

   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor

The government is likely to have to provide several hundred million
pounds for a special fund to pay for cleaning up nuclear power station
sites after next year's privatisation of the industry. The fund will
also have to be given tax-exempt status.

Advisers in the City of London are working on the structure of the
segregated fund which was announced earlier this month by Mr Tim Eggar,
the energy minister. The fund would be managed by an independent trust
to ensure money was available to decommission power stations over a
period that could last more than 100 years. The fund will have to be
endowed with an initial cash amount of between Pounds 200m (Dollars
312m) and Pounds 300m. This sum would be increased using earnings from
British Energy, the privatised company, to meet decommissioning
liabilities. However, contributions would come out of the company's
taxed income. So the trust itself would have to be exempt from tax to
avoid double taxation.

The size of the trust's liabilities is still being calculated. The fund
would be responsible only for long-term decommissioning - monitoring
sites while disused reactors 'cooled down' and eventually dismantling
them after 135 years. The larger costs of the first stage of
decommissioning a power station, including removal of spent fuel and
contaminated components, would be paid for by British Energy, which
would also bear the risk of a power station being shut down before
adequate provisions had been built up.

British Energy will also be directly responsible for disposing of spent
fuel, which represents the largest part of its total liabilities,
estimated at Pounds 6bn.

The initial finance for the fund could either be provided by the
government or raised through a loan from the private sector. But the
government has been told that it should provide the finance itself
because a loan would only reduce the potential sale price of British
Energy.

Another important decision will be the discount rate used to calculate
the size of provisions made by British Energy to meet its liabilities.
Present estimates have been based on the 6 per cent rate used by the
Treasury. The nuclear industry uses 2 per cent, which means that larger
provisions have to be made to reach the target.

The government's Department of Trade and Industry is expected soon to
publish details of the capital structure of British Energy.

SHOPPERS STABBED


A store worker ran amok with three knives yesterday and stabbed 10
people. The man marched through the aisles at the Netto store in
Bordesley Green in the English Midlands city of Birmingham, attacking
shoppers and staff. Two men and a woman were later stable in hospital.
Seven other people including a 13-year-old boy suffered less serious
wounds. A man was arrested outside the store by unarmed police.
