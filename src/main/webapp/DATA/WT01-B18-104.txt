<center><H3>CHARTING PROGRESS IN TREATMENT OF CANCER</H3></center><br>

<P>
Important advances in the treatment of cancer are outlined in
a new booklet launched on 25 January in London by the Association
of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI).
<P>
The booklet, <i>Target Cancer</i>, describes some of the research and
clinical contributions to the anticancer battle currently being
made by British-based pharmaceutical companies.
<P>
Some 160,000 people die of cancer each year in the UK alone, and
the pharmaceutical industry plays a vital role in investigating
the disease. More money is invested into researching how cancer
works and how to treat it by the industry - which spends a total
of &#163;4 million a day on research and developing new medicines
- than the Government and charities combined, the booklet points
out.
<P>
&quot;The UK pharmaceutical industry has a worldwide reputation
for its research and development into cancers, as it does in many
other disease areas,&quot; said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General
of the ABPI, who chaired the launch of the booklet. &quot;Yet
we are not in competition with the basic work of Government-funded
and charity-based scientists - rather we are working in full co-operation
and collaboration with them.&quot;
<P>
Nearly 50 new potential compounds in UK clinical trials for cancer
treatment or diagnosis are listed in the booklet, including more
than 30 non-biological treatments - the others are biological
products resulting from research in molecular biology. The first
category incorporates medicines to fight cancer in a variety of
areas, including breast cancer (six new medicines); large intestine
(six); prostate (five); lung (five); and leukaemias (three).
<P>
The rest are in other areas, including cancers of the ovaries,
pancreas, kidney, testes, stomach, head/neck, liver, and tumours
in various nervous tissue locations. Among the biological products
are stimulators of blood cell production in the bone marrow, bone
marrow protectors, immune stimulators and vaccine-type agents.
There are also three agents designed to break the resistance that
some tumours develop to medicines.
<P>
<i>Target Cancer</i> explains that one of the most serious problems facing
clinicians in the treatment of cancer is the development of resistance
to the medicines used. Studies in the USA have suggested that
90 per cent of the 1,400 people who die from cancer each day have
developed resistance at the time of their death.
<P>
Anti-cancer medicines need to accumulate inside cells to work.
Many cells that become resistant develop a mechanism for pumping
out anti-cancer medicines. Much research has therefore been directed
towards the discovery of compounds to prevent or reverse this
process, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of current medicines.
If this proves possible, one of the major problems facing physicians
is overcome.
<P>
Scientists have now identified many of the altered outer constituents
of cancer cells, raising the possibility that anti-cancer vaccines
can be made. New types of anti-cancer vaccine have been produced
and some are in early trials for solid tumours such as breast,
pancreas, large intestine, lung, prostate and skin cancer (melanoma).
<P>
However, the booklet suggests these products are more likely to
complement available therapies and boost other therapeutic measures
rather than replace them.
<P>
Among more conventional approaches, advances are being made in
areas, including:
<UL>
<LI>In <b>breast cancer</b> research, particular attention has been paid
to dealing with 'steroid-dependent' tumours, whose growth depends
on 'stimulation' by oestrogen. Developments are also being made
with an agent originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific
yew tree, but which can now be made synthetically.
<LI>Recent developments have resulted in improved survival rates
for patients in the advanced stages of <b>ovarian cancer</b>. A new class
of anti-cancer medicines has shown effectiveness in patients who
have not responded to some forms of conventional therapy.
<LI><b>Prostate</b> cancer and prostate enlargement - which often precedes
cancerous transformation - are a massive potential medical problem.
In Europe, there are some 19 million cases, with only about two
million receiving treatment. Several companies are developing
therapies to deal with both conditions.
<LI>Affecting both men and women, <b>cancer of the large intestine</b>
is one of the most frequent causes of death and is a tumour that
spreads easily, especially to the liver. Several companies have
made this a high-priority objective.
<LI>Established <b>lung cancer </b>is among the most difficult of all
cancers to treat. In an attempt to improve therapy, several companies
are investigating medicines aimed at targeting the tumours more
effectively.
</UL>

<P>
The booklet examines progress in the research into cancer being
made by the British-based industry in four main areas, although
the unique expertise of the industry lies in designing, synthesising
and testing new molecules. &quot;Some companies are British owned,
while others are subsidiaries of multinational organisations which
recognise the reputation of British medicine by basing their research
and development or clinical research facilities here,&quot; states
the booklet.
<P>
The booklet stresses there is clearly much more to be done in
the fight against cancer, and that many companies intend applying
gene therapy to many forms of cancer. &quot;If this happens, it
could herald the dawn of a new era of cancer treatment,&quot;
the booklet states.
<P>
The overall message of <i>Target Cancer</i> is encouraging. Increasingly,
there is greater openness about the causes and treatment of cancer
which will help to take the mystery out of the disease and remove
some of the fear still attached to it.
<P>
&quot;In the meantime, those who develop cancer should be aware
of the great progress that has been made - many tumours can be
cured and for those where this remains impossible, the duration
and quality of their lives can often be greatly increased,&quot;
the booklet says.
<P>
<i>Target Cancer </i> has been produced to inform the general public of
the contribution being made by the UK-based pharmaceutical industry
towards diagnosing and treating cancer. Researched and written
by Dr Mike Hall, a well-respected medical writer, the booklet
is available free from the ABPI, 12 Whitehall, London, SWIA 2DY, United Kingdom.
