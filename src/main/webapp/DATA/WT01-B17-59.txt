<A NAME="PICKLE">
        <H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>THE SUGUKI PICKLE:
<BR>MICROORGANISMS FOR YOUR
<BR>GOOD HEALTH</CENTER></H2>

Why are we writing about pickles, yogurt, and interferon in the same article? 
Unless you're cast in the role of a pregnant woman in a TV sitcom, you'd never think
of mentioning pickles and yogurt in the same breath.  And as for interferon, that
promising &quot;cancer cure&quot; in headlines a few years ago, what does that have to do with
either?


<P>     Well, pickles and yogurt do have something in common: They're both fermented
products, loaded with living microorganisms. (Or, at least the microorganisms were
living before the food processors, packagers, and preservatives got their hands on
them.)


<P>     Do we really want to eat something that's loaded with living microorganisms?  We
sure do! These microorganisms help with digestion and elimination.  They contribute
vitamins and enzymes and are natural antibiotics.  They're the sacrificial soldiers
of your intestine that fight and die for your health.  If you eat a fermented food
with viable bacteria, you have billions of these warriors at your service.  Your
intestinal flora is more than just important for good health-it's vital for life.


<P>     In fact, modern nutritionists are even beginning to view the intestinal flora as
an organ In its own right, responsible for some very specific functions in digestion
and disease-resistance.  Among the most important roles, intestinal flora is
responsible for: production of digestive enzymes; adaptogenic control (normalization)
of constipation and diarrhea; counteracting lactose (milk sugar) intolerance, by its
association with lactase which breaks down otherwise indigestible milk sugars;
intercepting carcinogenic (cancer-causing) substances before they are absorbed,
causing them to be eliminated instead of assimilated; destroying tumors in the
digestive tract with anticarcinogens, and probably also by producing enzymes that
degrade cancer-causing nitrosamines.


<P>     There's more.  Also involved: detoxification, by binding to unwanted metabolites
and causing them to be excreted; immune functions of the intestinal tract lining, by
protecting the surfaces of intestinal mucous membranes; suppression of undesirable
bacteria by maintaining an antibacterial and antifungal environment; reduction of bad
breath by replacing organisms responsible for unpleasant odors with neutral
organisms; reduction of flatulence (intestinal gas) by breaking down sugars
(including lactose) that promote and are consumed by certain bacteria; cholesterol
control, by promoting normal absorption of dietary fats and facilitating elimination
of unwanted cholesterol before it is absorbed; production of additional supplies of
vitamins and other trace nutrients.


<P>     Synthesis of digestive enzymes help supplement the natural food enzymes in other
foods that are destroyed by cooking.  Suppression of candida, as well as a number of
other intestinal disorders, is accomplished by replacing undesirable intestinal flora
with desirable microorganisms.


<P>     Now let's shift to Kyoto, Japan, three hundred years ago.  Kyoto was already
famous for its pickled delicacies.  One species in particular, which grew only in the
rich soil and clear water of the Kamigamo River region to the north, developed a
reputation for exceptional medicinal effects.  This was the suguki, a white vegetable
resembling a turnip.  It became a favorite of the clergy and nobility.  Eventually
the popularity of fermented suguki pickle spread to all the people of Kyoto, who
developed a reputation for health and longevity.


<P>     Back to the present.  <I>The suguki</I> pickle remains an important part of traditional
Kyoto cuisine, and today the life expectancy of the Kyoto resident is several years
longer than that of the average American.  When researchers at the Institute Pasteur
de Kyoto took a close look at the fermented suguki pickle, they found a subspecies of
Lactobacillus, called <I>Lactobacillus brevis subspecies coagulants</I>, or <I>Labre</I>.


<P>     This microorganism is notable for its ability to stimulate the natural production
of interferon!  Interferon is composed of-small proteins produced by various kinds of
cells as part of the defense mechanism against viruses and virus-related diseases.


<P>     Modern nutrition is beginning to look at disease differently It's not always the
consequence of an undesirable parasite or other foreign enemy invader, but can also
be the result of the <I>absence</I> of a necessary factor.  Supplementation with Labre could
help to insure that your intestinal flora is maintained at peak condition.  It
provides the most basic factors necessary for optimal health in our very non-optimal
environment.

<HR><A NAME="kava"> </A>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>THE NATURAL SLEEP SEDATIVE
OF THE PACIFIC</CENTER></H2>

        The kava plant, piper methysticum (which has nothing to do with java or coffee),
is a member of the pepper family Its root yields a group of fat-like substances
called kavalactones, which have a significant pharmacological effect.  Used as both a
traditional remedy and ceremonial intoxicant for thousands of years throughout
Polynesia, Melanesia, and parts of Micronesia in the South      Pacific, kava is a
muscle relaxant and a mild tranquilizer.  In small amounts, the beverage prepared
from its root produces euphoria; in large amounts, relaxation, lethargy of lower
limbs, and eventual sleep.  It does not impair mental alertness and encourages a
rather cheerful and friendly attitude.


<P>     If it's been used for thousands of years, why discuss it in our segment on
Supplement Updates?  Because it is new on the scene in most health stores today!


<P>     Pacific Islanders have traditionally used kava to treat everything from epilepsy
to toothaches.  In New Guinea, scrapings of the root are chewed to relieve sore
throats.  Other cultures have used kava in various ways against headache, menstrual
problems, tuberculosis, asthma, urinary disorders, gonorrhea, and even to provoke
abortion by inserting kava leaves vaginally.


<P>     In traditional use, the root of the kava plant is pounded, ground, or chewed
(with kava ceremonies often calling for the chewing to be performed by a virgin
girl), and the substance is mixed with saliva or water to make a drink.  The
psychoactivity of this drink is described as both complex and subtle.  Captain Cook
observed that the members of his crew who experimented with large doses experienced
an effect similar to that of opium.  Kava is not hallucinogenic, however.


<P>     The kava &quot;high&quot; appears to be much more mellow than that achieved from alcohol,
and socialization appears to be enhanced rather than 'jeopardized.  Because of these
advantages, alcoholics on the islands have been known to cure themselves of their
addiction with the use of kava.


<P>     Kava has suddenly become the focus of attention because it offers a far more
natural alternative to frequently-prescribed drugs such as valium-having the
potential for achieving similar results without the known side effects of commonly
used drugs. (Unlike valium, for example, kava usually leaves the consumer alert.)

<P>     One of the primary uses of kava is to promote sleep.  With tryptophane off the
market due to serious damage caused by the tainting of one manufacturer's product,
there is a strong demand for a sleep-inducing substance that is safe and natural.


<P>     Kava has also been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety In two recent
double-blind, placebo-controlled German studies, this effect was significant, as
measured by standardized tests after only one week of use.


<P>     Is kava safe?  The fact that kava has been used for centuries by people all over
the South Pacific with remarkable absence of negative side effects or addiction
speaks well for its safety.


<P>     Another new study shows enhanced performance on word association tests with the
use of kava.  And, in 1992, it was demonstrated that kava extract exhibited
neuroprotective activity against ischemic brain damage in test animals.


<P>     Pulverized kava root can be found in health stores.  Keep in mind that while
aqueous kava extracts may have some value, it is the fat-soluble kavalactones from
kava resin that have the primary psychoactive action.


<P>     It's interesting to note that the world's most popular drugs are stimulant drinks
such as coffee, tea, and cola.  Considering the nature of our society, there may be a
legitimate place for a sedative drink among these, especially one that's safe and
natural and keeps us clear-thinking.  In addition to the important medical role that
can be foreseen for this pepper plant root, kava products or beverages might turn out
to be attractive alternatives to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs that find their
way into our lives.
