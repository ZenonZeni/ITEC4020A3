<H3>ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF:
</H3><P>Our administrative staff coordinates between Surrogate, Intended
Parents, doctors, psychologists, laboratories, hospitals and attorneys. (Doctors,
psychologists, attorneys are independent professionals.)
<P>Our skilled staff provides care and quidance, and ensures that all necessary
steps are taken and full documentation is in place prior to commencement
of medical procedures. Additionally, statistics are updated regularly regarding
our program.
<P>Staff includes:
<P>
<UL><LI>Medical Coordinator-coordinates all medical aspects of the process,
including screening &amp; procedures.<BR>
<LI>Financial Trust Administrator-handles all financial matters between couple
and Surrogate Mother.<BR>
<LI>Surrogate Coordinator-contact person for potential surrogate mothers.<BR>
<LI>Administrative-responsible for requests for information, correspondence,

</UL><P>
<H3>PSYCHOLOGISTS:
</H3><P>Psychological Team of Dr. <a href="Hillbio.html">Hilary Hanafin</a>, Carol Wolfe MFCC, Donna
Robertson LCSW, and Dr. <a href="Gordbio.html">Elaine Gordon</a>, are specifically trained and individually
recognized nationally for their work in the field of third party reproduction.
Each surrogate mother is assigned to a specific counselor, who will provide
ongoing support and guidance throughout the surrogacy process. Every month,
our surrogates attend a group support meeting where they meet with other
surrogate mothers in their area. The Center believes that it is very important
that each person involved in the surrogacy relationship is taken care of,
therefore, not only the surrogate mother, but also her spouse and children
are taken into consideration during screening and participation in the program.
<P>The counseling team also does a psychological evaluation on both the Intended
parents to determine their appropriateness for surrogacy. Those couples who
the Psychologists do not feel are appropriate are not accepted by CSP's program.
<P>
<H3>INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS:
</H3><P>The Center works in conjunction with recognized infertility specialists
who utilize advanced reproductive technologies. These specialists are independent
of the Center. All participants undergo an in depth medical screening and
evaluation in our Surrogate Program.
<P>For IVF, typically, the specialist involved is the doctor that the couple
has past experience working with.
<P>For Artificial Insemination, the Center will send you to a doctor closest
to the Surrogate Mother.
<P>
<H3>LEGAL COUNSEL:
</H3><P>The Surrogate Mother and the Intended Parents must each meet with
outside independent legal counsel to discuss the contractual agreement into
which they both enter. This contract should define all parties' rights and
responsibilities. Contracts are drafted by the couple's attorney, The Law Offices of Vorzimer, Garber, Masserman &amp; Ecoff</a>.
