<h3>Who's Watching You and What are You Telling Them?</h3>
Many people surf the web under the illusion that their actions are private and anonymous.  
Unfortunately, there is more information collected about you than you might think.  
Every time you visit a site, you leave a calling card that reveals where you're coming from, 
what kind of computer you have, and many other details.  Most sites keep logs of all visitors. 

<H3>But Others May Know A Lot More...</H3>

<font size = +1>
As a small non-profit public interest organization, CDT's web pages reside on a 
server run by our (very accommodating) Internet service provider, and as a result, 
our ability to collect even more revealing personal information than what is displayed 
above is limited.  However, a web site operator with the right equipment and the desire 
to do so can easily obtain your e-mail address, the exact files you viewed, and other 
detailed information without your knowledge.  And you reveal information to web site 
operators both directly and indirectly.<p> 

<H3>How Your Personal Information Gets Collected</H3>

<B>Web sites and Web browsers</B><p>

Your personal information (including your hobbies, political and product interests and 
ways to contact you, such as your e-mail address) can be collected by web sites in two 
ways: directly or indirectly.<p>

<UL>
<LI><B>Passive recording of Transactional Information:</B>  The transactional information 
revealed in the normal course of surfing the net reveals a great deal of information about 
your online activities. When you visit a particular web site, for example,  the webmaster 
can determine what files, pictures, or other information you are most interested in (and 
what you ignored), how long you examined a particular page, image or file, where you 
came from, where you went to.<p>

Web servers collect transactional information in order to allow the system operator to 
perform necessary system maintenance, auditing, and other essential system functions.  
However, when correlated with other sources of personal information, including marketing 
databases, phone books, voter registration lists, etc, a detailed profile of your online activities 
can be created without your knowledge or consent.<p>

<LI><B>Cookies:</B> Additionally, many web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," 
or client-side persistent information.  Cookies allows any web site to store information 
about your visit to that site on your hard drive.  Every time you return to that site, "cookies" 
will read your hard drive to find out if you've been there before.  For example, try visiting 
<A HREF="http://www.illuminatus.com/cookie">this web site</A>  twice.<p>

<LI><B>Direct disclosure of personal information:</B> A growing number of web sites 
offer users the ability to register with the site.  In many cases, registration brings real, 
important benefits, such as access to special areas, timely information, discounts, etc.  
While registration or other mechanisms by which users divulge personal information to a 
web site provide some obvious benefits to a users, it also provides the site's operator with 
a detailed picture of how you use the site.<p>
</UL>

Regardless of how the information is obtained, a great deal of personally identifiable 
information is revealed in the normal course of surfing the web. <p>

<B>Commercial Online Service Providers</B><p>

Commercial online service providers are configured in a variety of ways, but generally, 
little personally identifiable information is revealed to Internet sites visited directly from 
an online service.<p>

<STRONG>[Many commercial online service subscribers have reported problems accessing the CDT Privacy Demonstration from their service.  This has to do with the configuration of the Internet connection from the online service.]</STRONG> <P>

If you subscribe to a commercial online service, your service provider has access to lots 
of information about your online activities.  These records are generated in the normal 
course of using the service, and are important for billing and maintenance purposes.  
However, not all services treat the use and disclosure of this information the same way.  
CDT'S Clearinghouse on Privacy Policies focuses first on the fair information practices 
of the <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/online_services/chart.html">major 
commercial online service providers</A>, including America Online, Compuserve, 
Microsoft Network and Prodigy.<p>

Later, CDT will focus on other Internet entities, such as browsers, content providers, 
and Internet service providers.<p> 

<H3>Why should you care?</H3>

Although it may not seem like it, someone is following you through cyberspace.  
Every time you retrieve a file, view an image, send an e-mail message or jump to a 
new web site, a record is created somewhere on the Net.<p>

While much of this information may never be used, it can be, and you have little 
control over it.  In the hands of a marketer with a powerful computer, or the government, 
it is possible to build a detailed profile of your tastes and preferences by monitoring your 
online activities.  The information can be used to send you unsolicited e-mail or snail mail, 
to call you, or to even put you on a list of people likely to support a particular political 
candidate.  A single piece of information about you can support a tremendous range of 
activities.  For example, if your repeated visits to web sites containing information on 
cigarettes results in free samples, coupons, or even e-mail to you about a new tobacco 
product, you may not be concerned.  However, if your visits to these web sites result in 
escalating insurance premiums due to categorization as a smoker - now you're beginning 
to get concerned.<p>

<h3>Privacy Policies and Practices</h3>

In the United States, there is no comprehensive law that protects people's privacy.  
Instead a patchwork of Constitutional, statutory and private sector guidelines that protect 
different areas of your informational privacy.<p>

<h3>CDT's Web Site Privacy Policy</h3>

Like virtually all web sites, CDT collects information to analyze traffic patterns and 
to perform routine system maintenance.   We do not use the system logs or other records 
for any other purpose, nor do we sell, rent or otherwise disclose our mailing lists.<p>

For the purposes of this demonstration, we will use information generated during your 
visit to the Privacy Web site to illustrate examples of what information you are revealing to us. 
None of the information generated during the course of your visit to this demonstration will be 
used for any other purposes, and logs will be purged on a regular basis.<P>

<h3>How to Surf without Being Watched</h3>

<A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com"><B>The Anonymizer</B></A><P>

The Anonymizer was created by Community ConneXion ("C2") for those whose 
illusions of anonymity have been shattered.  It is a web site that shields your personal 
information from the other web sites that you visit.  By visiting the Anonymizer web site 
before visiting other web sites, you are assigned an anonymous identity which is revealed 
(instead of your real identity) as you surf the web.  It allows you to surf freely, even if you 
follow a hypertext link to another web site, without having to worry that the web site you 
are reading is keeping track of who you are and your interests.<p>
