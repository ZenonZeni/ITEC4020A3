<P>Notation conventions :
<P>$       - the use of the "$"' (dollar  sign) in the documentation denotes a requirement           for the blank character (ie.
the ASCII or EBCDIC space character).
<P>(n)     - this expression is used to denote the contents of an integer binary field           which will vary depending on the
product type or data origin and will have           to be supplied on the CCT by the facility generating the CCT.
<P><.....> - this expression is used to denote the contents of an alphanumeric field,           which will vary depending on the
product type or data origin and will have           to be supplied on the CCT by the facility generating the CCT.
<P><$...$> - this expression is used to denote a blank field.
