        BRIEFING SHEET
</b></pre>

<hr>

<p>On September 5th, national drug control policy director
William Bennett will formally release his longawaited
&quot;National Drug Control Strategy.&quot; The report is
designed to present a comprehensive plan for responding to the
nation's drug problem. Although final details of the plan were
not to be made public until then, a 235page draft submitted to
the President for review was &quot;leaked&quot; and circulating
in Washington in August 1989. The final report is expected to be
similar to the draft proposal.<br>
Following is a summary and analysis of the proposed drug
strategy. <br>
<u>Highlights of the Drug Strategy<br>
</u>Although the drug strategy calls for funding and programming
in several areas, its primary thrust is in the area of law
enforcement, with less focus on prevention, treatment, and
education. Greater emphasis is also to be placed on &quot;demand
reduction&quot; by imposing new sanctions on &quot;casual
users.&quot; These sanctions will include such penalties as
revoking drivers' licenses, sentences to &quot;boot camps,&quot;
and evictions from public housing.<br>
<u>Law Enforcement/Prisons</u> The Bennett plan proposes an
increase in federal aid to state and local governments for
drugrelated law enforcement from the current level of $150
million to $350 million. In addition, funding levels for federal
prison construction would be increased from $580 million to $1.2
billion.<br>
<u>Treatment</u> Funding for drug treatment programs through the
Department of Health and Human Resources would increase from $481
million to $740 million.<br>
<u>Education</u> The Education Department would receive an
increase from $355 million to $392 million for antidrug programs.<br>
<u>International Enforcement</u> Between $300400 million would be
made available in economic and military assistance to Latin
American countries to combat the spread of cocaine.<br>
<u>Other Features</u> The drug strategy includes a variety of
other proposals, including the use of civil commitment
proceedings to force drug addicts into treatment, mandatory
imposition of user sanctions by colleges in order to receive
federal funds, and a crackdown on marijuana use.<br>

<u>Problems with the Drug Strategy<br>
</u>The establishment of the drug policy position created an
opportunity to conduct a broad examination of the reasons why
drug use pervades our society from innercity &quot;crack&quot;
houses to suburban homes to professional athletics. In contrast
to previous &quot;wars on drugs,&quot; the drug &quot;czar&quot;
position carried no mandate to adopt an exclusively
lawenforcement approach. Instead, there was the potential to
explore the range of social, economic, moral, and psychological
factors leading to drug use, and thereby creating the basis for
proposing solutions to respond to the crisis. The Bennett plan,
though, avoids asking these difficult questions, and instead
proposes &quot;more of the same.&quot; <br>
1. <u>Contrary to some initial publicity, the Bennett strategy
continues a fifteenyear commitment to a law enforcement approach,
and not to prevention, treatment, or education</u>.<br>
The proposed budget increase for federal prisons alone $654
million is greater than the total recommended increase of $565
million for treatment and prevention. Total law enforcement
funding would outpace spending for treatment and prevention by
more than twotoone. <br>
In doing so, the plan continues a pattern of funding priorities
that began shifting in the mid1970s. From 197075, twothirds of
antidrug funding $1.92 billion of $3 billion was devoted to
prevention, treatment, and education. Between 197681, 43 percent
of the total $5.2 billion budget went to these categories.
Beginning in 1982, the first full year of funding under the
Reagan administration, 80 percent of drug funding went to law
enforcement, with this pattern continuing until passage of the
1988 AntiDrug Abuse Act. <br>
From 1981 through 1986, federal funding for law enforcement more
than doubled from $800 million in 1981 to $1.9 billion in 1986.
At the same time, federal funding for prevention, education, and
treatment declined from $404 million in 1981 to $338 million in
1985. When adjusted for inflation, this amounted to a 40 percent
decrease. The Bennett plan restores some of these funds that had
been cut over the years, but still maintains a primary emphasis
on a law enforcement approach.<br>
2. <u>The drug strategy represents a continuation of a failed
approach</u>.<br>
Fighting the &quot;war on drugs&quot; primarily through law
enforcement more arrests, more prisons, and more prisoners is
hardly a new approach. The past decade has seen a doubling in our
nation's prison population at tremendous financial cost, much of
it due to drugrelated offenses. By the end of 1989, there will be
one million prisoners in our nation's prisons and jails. This
massive increase, though, has resulted in no appreciable drop in
the crime rate or the prevalence of drugs. As the Bennett paper
notes, &quot;drugs are potent, drugs are cheap, and drugs are
available to almost anyone who wants them&quot; (Draft, <u>National
Drug Control Strategy</u>, pp. 34).<br>
As former Washington, D.C. Police Chief Maurice Turner has
remarked, even though District police made over 40,000 drug
arrests in the past year, drug use in the nation's capital
remains rampant, along with the crime associated with it. As long
as the conditions which breed drug use exist, there will be a
constant source of potential new users.<br>
3. <u>&quot;Boot camps&quot; recommended in the Bennett plan will
likely result in more prisoners, with no guarantee of any decline
in crime or drug use</u>.<br>
Although sometimes referred to as &quot;alternatives&quot; to
prison, boot camps in fact are essentially prisons, albeit
shortterm ones. States which currently operate boot camp programs
generally use a model of a 36 month militarystyle regimen in an
institution. In recommending the expansion of boot camps, the
drug strategy flies in the face of government reports
recommending caution in their development. A 1988 GAO report
(&quot;Prison Boot Camps: Too Early to Measure
Effectiveness&quot;) concluded that it was &quot;too early to
measure [the] effectiveness&quot; of boot camps, while a recent
National Institute of Justice study (&quot;Shock Incarceration:
An Overview of Existing Programs&quot;) stated that, at present,
&quot;We don't know whether [boot camp] changes offenders'
attitudes, or whether it deters or rehabilitates more or less
effectively than other communitybased sanctions&quot; (p. 35).<br>
4. <u>Locking up more drug offenders will only exacerbate the
problems in our prison system</u>.<br>
Prison populations are at an alltime high, and prison systems in
forty states are under court order to improve conditions. Adding
additional thousands of drug users will only add to this burden.<br>
The serious shortage of treatment programs in prisons has insured
that incarceration cannot &quot;cure&quot; most drug addicts. A
recent Justice Department study of offenders released from state
prisons found that 62 percent of persons imprisoned for drug
possession were rearrested within three years of release. As
former Watergate figure and prisoner Charles Colson has said
recently, &quot;Addicts leave prison just as likely to commit new
crimes as when they went in.&quot; If we cannot help drug
offenders who are already incarcerated, there is little hope of
providing meaningful treatment to additional thousands of
prisoners. <br>
5. <u>The Bennett plan advocates increased incarceration, but the
major cost of this policy will be borne by state and local
governments for decades to come</u>.<br>
The vast majority of drug arrests are made at the state level.
Increased funding to state and local governments for law
enforcement will lead to more arrests, convictions, and sentences
to prison. Yet, the Bennett plan includes no funding for state
prison construction or costs of incarceration. Each new prison
cell built to accommodate Bennett's strategy will cost about
$50,000, plus approximately $20,000 a year for housing of each
new prisoner. All of these costs will be the responsibility of
state and local taxpayers, diverting funds from schools, roads,
housing, and treatment programs. <br>
<u>There is a Better Way<br>
</u>Addressing the drug problem needs to begin with the premise
that drugs are a problem which society as a whole needs to deal
with, and not just the criminal justice system. As with other
issues, the criminal justice system may provide some measure of
justice and safety, but it is not designed to resolve underlying
social and economic issues. A constructive approach to the drug
problem which the Bennett plan could have emphasized would have
been the following:<br>
<u>Social and Economic Issues<br>
</u>Contrary to the contention of Bennett and others, addressing
the problem of poverty and &quot;quality of life&quot; are <u>both</u>
shortterm and longterm issues. Funds that will be used to build
and operate prisons could instead be devoted to programs of job
training and placement, school dropout prevention, child care
programs, and other needed services. <br>
<u>Treatment<br>
</u>As the Bennett plan notes, &quot;treatment for drug addiction
can and often does work.&quot; Yet, in 1987, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse estimated that publicly funded drug
treatment was available for only 4 percent of the estimated 6.5
million drug users and addicts who needed help. Substance abusers
with financial resources have little trouble finding highquality
treatment programs. For poor people seeking help, though, a
sixmonth waiting list for treatment is not unusual.<br>
No single drug program or approach will work for all drug users.
What is needed is a funding commitment to develop a variety of
models to respond to the range of drugs and drug users.<br>
<u>Prevention and Education<br>
</u>From 1982 to 1985, only $23 million a year, 1 percent of
total drug abuse funding, was spent on prevention and education.
Although the 1988 AntiDrug Abuse Act increased funding in this
area tenfold, more than threequarters of all funding still
remained in &quot;supply reduction.&quot;<br>
With the important exception of &quot;crack,&quot; drug use has
generally been declining over the past several years. Most
experts believe this is primarily due to increased awareness
about the hazards of drugs, and not through reduced availability
or increased sanctions. Now is the time to build on this
progress, and to design new methods of reaching young people.<br>
