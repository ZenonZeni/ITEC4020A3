BEVERAGES ARE FOOD CATEGORY PURCHASED
MOST OFTEN BY MASS RETAIL SHOPPERS, SURVEY SHOWS

     Carbonated soft drinks and juice are the two food items
consumers are most likely to buy at mass retail stores, according to a
new study published by the International Mass Retail Association
(IMRA). The study was prepared by the Gallup Organization for
IMRA's membership, which includes discount department stores,
warehouse/club stores, specialty discounters, deep discount drug stores,
off-price stores, variety stores, and dollar stores, among others.

     The study, entitled Consumer Shopping Behavior on Food
Merchandise and In-store Food Services, includes the responses of 1,011
adults aged 18 years and older, who were surveyed by telephone in
September 1995. Among the findings of the study were the following
highlights.

Profile of Survey Participants

     * Nearly one-fourth of all respondents (23 percent) said they
visited mass retail or discount stores more than once a week in a typical
month. Thirty-one percent said they visited such stores twice (16
percent) or three times (15 percent) a month. Only seven percent of all
respondents said they never visited mass retail stores.

     * Females  were significantly  more likely to be the primary
shopper  in  the  family  for  clothing  and  household goods (92
percent), and food (89 percent), than  were males (70 percent).

     * Accordingly, females were more frequent visitors to mass
retail stores than males, with 19 percent of the female respondents
saying they went to mass retail stores at least once a week in a typical
month, compared to only 12 percent of males who visited such stores
that often.

     * Older respondents appeared slightly less likely to visit mass
retail stores than were the younger respondents. Only six percent of
those aged 18 to 34 years said they never visited mass retail stores, while
twice as many of those 55 years or older (13 percent) never visited these
stores.

     * Respondents were most likely (73 percent) to express a
preference for shopping at one store that carried a complete selection
of groceries as well as general merchandise.

     * Slightly more than one in six (17 percent) of all respondents
said that they always make some type of packaged food purchase during
a visit to a mass retail store. Another 27 percent said that they
frequently make such purchases. About three in ten respondents said
they rarely (20 percent) or never (nine percent) purchase packaged
foods at mass retail stores.

     * Older respondents appear less likely to purchase packaged
food at mass retail stores than do younger respondents. One third (32
percent) of those respondents age 55 and older said they rarely (21
percent) or never (nine percent) purchased packaged foods at mass
retail stores, compared to only 25 percent of those respondents aged 18
to 34 who rarely (18 percent) or never (seven percent) purchased such
food items.

     There were no significant regional or income differences in
terms of purchase frequency for packaged foods.

Soda and Juice Purchases

     The survey participants were asked how often they bought
these particular food items at mass retail stores: soda; juice; canned or
dried foods; snack foods; cookies; candy; alcoholic beverages; and baby
food.

     * Of all the food products that were specified in the survey,
soda and juice were the two products most often reported to be "very
likely" to be purchased at mass retail stores. Each product was rated
by 39 percent of the respondents to be a product they would be "very
likely" to buy at a mass retail store.

     * Respondents aged 55 years and older (32 percent) and those
respondents in the northeast (33 percent) showed a slightly lower
tendency to purchase soda.

     * Thirty-four percent of the respondents said they would be
somewhat likely to purchase soda; 26 percent said they were not at all
likely to purchase soda. One percent responded "don't know."

     * Respondents aged 35 to 54 years (36 percent) said they were
slightly less likely to purchase juice at a mass retail store, compared to
those respondents aged 55 years and older (42 percent). Respondents in
the south central region of the U.S. (43 percent), and those with
incomes of less than $20,000, were slightly more likely to purchase
juice.

The Decision To Purchase

     When asked to indicate their typical weekly packaged food
expenditures at mass retail stores, respondents indicated their average
expenditure was slightly less than $32 a week. Forty-four percent of all
respondents, however, indicated that they spend $20 or less in a typical
week for packaged food purchases.

     Respondents in the western region of the U.S. had the largest
weekly expenditures for packaged foods, while single respondents, those
55 years and older, and those in the north central region, spent the least
on average.

     Respondents were asked to characterize their food purchases
as either "planned" or "impulse" purchases. In the categories of both
packaged and prepared food, respondents were more likely to make the
decision to purchase after they were at the stores. Respondents were,
however, significantly more likely to view prepared food purchases as
impulse purchases, as opposed to packaged food purchases.

     Respondents were asked to rate various factors they consider
when deciding to buy food at mass retail stores. Quality was rated the
most important factor by 71 percent of respondents; price was second
most important, with 61 percent of participants citing it as a factor.
Selection of brands was third, at 38 percent; followed by
coupons/special promotions, 34 percent; advertised specials, 33 percent;
availability of specialty foods, 31 percent; and availability of store
brands, 21 percent.

     Females (77 percent) and respondents in the northeast (78
percent) were most likely to rate quality as very important, while males
(64 percent) and those in the west (66 percent) and north central (67
percent) regions were least likely to rate quality as very important.

     Price  was  most important to  18-to-34  year-olds (67 percent),
those with household incomes of less than $20,000 a year (67 percent),
and females (65 percent). Respondents aged 55 years  or  older (52
percent),  those  with  household  incomes of $60,000 or greater (52
percent), and males (56 percent), were least likely to rate the price of an
item as extremely important.

Mass Retail Association (IMRA), phone (703) 841-2300.

MORE COMBINATION GROCERY/MERCHANDISE
STORES OPENED IN 1994, FMI STUDY SHOWS

     Although conventional supermarkets continue to account for
the single largest percentage of food stores in operation, the percentage
of combination grocery/merchandise stores rose significantly in 1994,
according to a new study by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI). The
study, entitled 1995 Facts About Store Development, revealed that in
1994, for the first time, conventional stores accounted for less than half
(48.9 percent) of all stores. The number of combination stores, by
contrast, rose seven percentage points to a 21 percent share.
Superstores continued to represent about 25 percent of food stores,
while warehouse and limited assortment stores accounted for less than
five percent.

     Supermarket construction grew at a modest rate during 1994,
when 3.3 percent of stores were new and 3.4 percent were closed --
figures similar to the previous year. According to FMI, this trend
indicates that new stores continue to replace older ones, rather than
gaining a greater share of the U.S. supermarket mix.

     The median size of new stores was 48,200 square feet in 1994,
up from 38,000 square feet the previous year. This increase was
attributed to the growth in construction of larger-sized combination
stores and superstores. More than six percent of stores underwent
major remodeling during the survey period, with competition cited by
three in 10 survey respondents as the primary reason, and half reporting
that the store needed it. Of the stores that were remodeled, four in 10
were also expanded, by an average of about 5,300 square feet.

COCA-COLA SOLD 3.8 BILLION UNIT CASES
IN U.S. LAST YEAR; FOUNTAIN SALES UP, TOO

     Coca-Cola Co. has reported that 1995 was a record-setting year
for the company, which sold 3.8 billion unit cases of soft drinks and
non-carbonated beverages in the U.S. In addition, for the first time,
Coca-Cola Co. sold one billion unit cases more than any other soft drink
competitor in the country.

     Jack L. Stahl, president of Coca-Cola USA, commented that
"the combined strength of our brand portfolio, our contour packaging
and our bottler system has allowed us to grow twice as fast as the
industry in 1995. We intend to build upon that momentum in 1996."

     Fountain sales contributed significantly to the company's robust
results. Coca-Cola Fountain added more than 500 new chain accounts
and 8,000 net new outlets last year, including the conversion of
competitive outlets such as Steak 'N Shake restaurants and Harrah's
Entertainment, as well as the addition of new outlets owned by existing
customers. According to the company, Coca-Cola products are currently
available in 92 of the top 100 fountain accounts in the U.S., outselling
the leading competitor by a 3-to-1 margin in the channel.

     The company also entered a unique agreement with
Blockbuster Entertainment in 1995, which places Coca-Cola products in
5,000 retail outlets worldwide.

     "We are extremely pleased with our 1995 success, even though
we experienced some disappointments -- losing some volume with
customers like Sbarro's, with some Jack-in-the-Box franchisees or with
Circle K, for example," noted Stahl. "We enter 1996 determined to
capture even more of the industry growth and to do all we can to help
our customers profitably build their soft drink businesses."

     Coca-Cola products are also widely available at recreational
facilities across the U.S., including 90 percent of sports venues, theme
parks and amphitheaters, and 85 percent of movie theaters and zoos.
Entertainment accounts that were added or renewed in 1995 included
the Sony movie theater chain, the Houston and Cincinnati zoos, and the
Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas, Nev.

MAINE BOTTLE BILL WOULD IMPOSE FEES,
PAPERWORK, ON BEVERAGE MAKERS

     The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) has
reported that the Maine Bottle Bill Task Force has proposed legislation
that would require all manufacturers to pay an annual $500 registration
fee to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural
Resources if their products are packaged in beverage containers subject
to the state's deposit system. The purpose of the bill is to reduce
fraudulent redemption of containers originating in neighboring states.
The annual fee would be used to pay for the department's enforcement
activities related to the administration of the bottle bill.

     But the proposal goes beyond a mere fee -- it would also create
a new paperwork burden. The bill would require manufacturers to
report:

     (1) each product brand name that requires a deposit;

     (2) the name and address of any distributor the manufacturer
uses to sell the products;

     (3) the number of "filled" beverage containers sold to
distributors in Maine;

     (4) the names and addresses of the manufacturer's third-party
"pick-up agents," which is defined as a person who has assumed the
container pick-up responsibility imposed on the deposit initiator; and

     (5) the number of beverage containers redeemed by the
manufacturer.

     To enforce these requirements, the bill provides the agriculture
department with broad powers to refuse to issue, revoke or suspend the
registration of a manufacturer, which would limit its ability to sell
products in Maine. Any manufacturer failing to register would be fined
$100 per day.
