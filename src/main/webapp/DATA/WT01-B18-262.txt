<P><CENTER>TEXT OF PROPOSED AMENDMENT</CENTER>

<P>Be it enacted by the people of the State of Arizona: The following amendments are proposed to become valid when approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon and upon proclamation pursuant thereto by the Governor of the State of Arizona.

<P>Section 1. TITLE

<P>THIS ACT SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS THE "DRUG MEDICALIZATION, PREVENTION, AND CONTROL ACT OF 1996."

<P>Section 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS

<P>THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA FIND AND DECLARE THE FOLLOWING:
<OL>
<LI> ARIZONA'S CURRENT APPROACH TO DRUG CONTROL NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED.
     THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO THE ARIZONA CRIMINAL
     JUSTICE COMMISSION, BETWEEN 1991 AND 1993 MARIJUANA USE DOUBLED AMONG
     ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS AND, BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993 QUADRUPLED AMONG
     MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO ACTIVELY ENFORCING OUR CRIMINAL
     LAWS AGAINST DRUGS, WE NEED TO MEDICALIZE ARIZONA'S DRUG CONTROL
     POLICY: RECOGNIZING THAT DRUG ABUSE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND
     TREATING ABUSE AS A DISEASE. THUS, DRUG TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUST
     BE EXPANDED.
<LI> WE MUST ALSO TOUGHEN ARIZONA'S LAWS AGAINST VIOLENT CRIMINALS ON DRUGS.
     ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLENT CRIME WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
     ILLEGAL DRUGS SHOULD SERVE 100% OF HIS OR HER SENTENCE WITH ABSOLUTELY
     NO EARLY RELEASE.
<LI> THOUSANDS OF ARIZONANS SUFFER FROM DEBILITATING DISEASES SUCH AS
     GLAUCOMA, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, CANCER, AND AIDS, BUT CANNOT HAVE ACCESS
     TO THE NECESSARY DRUGS THEY NEED. ALLOWING DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE
     SCHEDULE I CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES COULD SAVE VICTIMS OF THESE DISEASES
     FROM LOSS OF SIGHT, LOSS OF PHYSICAL CAPACITY, AND GREATLY REDUCE THE
     PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE SERIOUSLY ILL AND TERMINALLY ILL.
<LI> THE DRUG PROBLEMS OF NON-VIOLENT PERSONS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF PERSONAL
     POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS ARE BEST HANDLED THROUGH COURT-SUPERVISED
     DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE MORE
     EFFECTIVE THAN LOCKING NON-VIOLENT OFFENDERS UP IN A COSTLY PRISON.
     PILOT PROGRAMS IN ARIZONA THAT PROVIDE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON
     FOR LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENDERS HAVE A 73% SUCCESS RATE AND COST ROUGHLY
     1/8 AS MUCH AS PRISON. OVER THE NEXT DECADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
     DOLLARS CAN BE SAVED BY USING MANDATORY DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION
     PROGRAMS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON.
<LI> VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PUNISHED DUE TO THE PRISON
     OVER-CROWDING CRISIS IN ARIZONA. PLACING NON-VIOLENT PERSONS WHO ARE
     CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS IN COURT-SUPERVISED
     DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS WILL FREE UP SPACE IN OUR PRISONS
     SO THAT THERE IS ROOM TO INCARCERATE VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND DRUG
     DEALERS.
<LI> THE MISSING LINK IN DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION IS PARENTAL
     INVOLVEMENT. THE TAX DOLLARS SAVED BY ELIMINATING PRISON TIME FOR
     NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS
     SHOULD BE USED FOR DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION, TARGETED AT PROGRAMS
     THAT INCREASE PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR CHILDREN'S DRUG-EDUCATION.
</OL>
<P>Section 3. PURPOSE AND INTENT

<P>THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA DECLARE THEIR PURPOSES TO BE AS FOLLOWS:
<OL>
<LI> TO REQUIRE THAT ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLENT CRIME UNDER THE
     INFLUENCE OF DRUGS SERVE 100 PERCENT OF HIS OR HER SENTENCE AND NOT BE
     ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE OR ANY FORM OF EARLY RELEASE.
<LI> TO PERMIT DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE SCHEDULE I CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TO
     TREAT A DISEASE, OR TO RELIEVE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF SERIOUSLY ILL
     AND TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS.
<LI> TO REQUIRE THAT NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR
     USE OF DRUGS SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGO COURT-SUPERVISED MANDATORY DRUG
     TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND PROBATION.
<LI> TO REQUIRE THAT NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CURRENTLY IN PRISON FOR PERSONAL
     POSSESSION OR USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS, AND NOT SERVING A CONCURRENT
     SENTENCE FOR ANOTHER CRIME, OR PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OR SENTENCED OR
     SUBJECT TO SENTENCING UNDER ANY HABITUAL CRIMINAL STATUTE IN ANY
     JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES, BE MADE ELIGIBLE FOR IMMEDIATE
     PAROLE AND DRUG TREATMENT, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVICE.
<LI> TO FREE UP SPACE IN OUR PRISONS TO PROVIDE ROOM FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS.
<LI> TO EXPAND THE SUCCESS OF PILOT DRUG INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WHICH DIVERT
     DRUG OFFENDERS FROM PRISON TO DRUG TREATMENT, EDUCATION, AND
     COUNSELING.
</OL>
<P>Section 4.

<P>Title 41, Chapter 11, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding

     MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION SHALL BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR WITHIN

     YEAR TERM. OF THE NINE MEMBERS, FIVE SHALL BE PARENTS WITH CHILDREN

     OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, ONE SHALL BE AN EDUCATOR IN A LOCAL SCHOOL
     DISTRICT, ONE SHALL BE A REPRESENTATIVE OF A COUNTY PROBATION

<P>Section 13. Severability

<P>If any provision of this Act, or part thereof, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining sections shall not be affected
but shall remain in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions of
the Act are severable.

<P><CENTER>ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</CENTER>

<P><CENTER>(In compliance with A.R.S. section 19-124)</CENTER>

<P>Proposition 200 would require that certain persons who are convicted of drug offenses be sentenced as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Require that persons who commit violent crimes while under the influence of drugs serve 100% of their sentences, without eligibility for parole.
<P>
<LI> Require that persons who have been convicted before the proposition
passes of the personal possession or use of a controlled substance such as
marijuana and who are serving their sentence in prison be released on
parole. A person is released on parole after serving time in jail or prison,
is under the supervision of a parole officer and may have his parole revoked
if any condition of parole is violated. The State Department of Corrections
would be required to establish a procedure for paroling these persons. The
Board of Executive Clemency would be required to release these persons
unless the Board determines that a person would be a danger to the general
public. Persons who are released on parole would be required to participate
in drug treatment or education.
<P>
<LI> Require that persons who are convicted after the proposition passes of
the personal possession or use of a controlled substance such as marijuana
be eligible for probation. A person who is sentenced to probation does not
serve any time in jail or prison, is under the supervision of a probation
officer and remains free as long as the person continues his good behavior.
A person on probation would be required to participate in a drug treatment
or education program.
</OL>
<P>Proposition 200 would allow medical doctors to prescribe a controlled
substance such as marijuana to treat a disease or to relieve the pain and
suffering of a seriously or terminally ill patient. The doctor must be able
to document that scientific research supports the use of the controlled
substance and must obtain a written opinion from a second doctor that
prescribing the controlled substance is appropriate. A patient who receives,
possesses or uses a controlled substance as prescribed by a doctor would not
be subject to criminal penalties.
