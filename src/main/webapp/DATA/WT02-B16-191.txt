<p><strong>Research and Development</strong>
<P>
For PV to make a significant contribution to the nation's energy resource mix, the technology
must be improved and electricity from PV must become more cost-competitive. Therefore, we
continue to conduct basic and applied research on promising new materials, processes, devices,
and production techniques. We also carefully measure, model, and evaluate new concepts. We
perform the R&D in three primary areas: thin films, crystalline silicon, and advanced, high-efficiency concepts. 
<P>
Thin Films
<P>
Our researchers investigate four thin-film materials&#151;amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride,
copper indium diselenide, and thin-layer crystalline silicon&#151;because of their potential for low
cost and high performance. As part of this, we have established a major new initiative: the Thin Film PV Partnership. Under the partnership, we have awarded cost-shared contracts to nine
industry technology partners and about 20 university R&D partners to develop prototype
products based on the four thin-film materials.

Crystalline Silicon
<P>
Crystalline silicon is still the most commonly used PV material.  Under the Crystalline Silicon
Research Cooperative, we explore methods for achieving higher efficiency devices made with
less expensive, industrial-grade silicon. We also investigate how material impurities or "defects"
reduce the efficiency of solar cells; this understanding will enable manufacturers to compensate
for or avoid these defects.

Advanced, High-Efficiency Concepts
<P>
We develop advanced technologies for specialized markets, such as PV concentrator systems.
These include highly efficient (32% goal in the near term), single- and multijunction cells based
on gallium arsenide and related alloy materials. Today, industry work in this area is driven by
space markets (such as satellite power). The program also investigates thermophotovoltaic
devices, which convert thermal radiation to electrical energy.
