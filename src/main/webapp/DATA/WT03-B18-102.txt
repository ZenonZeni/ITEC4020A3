<P>G. Gordon Liddy: BATF's Worst Nightmare</P>

<P>taken from GUN NEWS Digest / Spring 1995</P>

<P>supplied by The P/\NTHER/UMF</P>

<P>The meteoric rise of the &quot;G. Gordon Liddy Show&quot; is one of
network radio's most amazing success stories. But it's also the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' worst nightmare.</P>

<P>Hardly a weekday goes by that Liddy doesn't blast the BATF as a bunch
of incompetent boobs, would-be Navy SEALS who wage war on the American
people. He has labeled the killings of the Branch Davidians at Waco, TX,
as simple murder and made no secret of his disdain for BATF agents.</P>

<P>What makes these remarks all the more telling is that Liddy was in charge
of trying to clean up some of BATF's messes back in the Nixon Administration.</P>

<P>Liddy's involvement in the Watergate affair made his name a household
word-and landed him five years in prison for steadfastly refusing to implicate
others. Much of that time was spend in maximum security with 106 days in
solitary confinement. President Carter finally pardoned him &quot;in the
interests of justice.&quot;</P>

<P>Since then you may have seen Liddy as an actor in the movies and on
television. He likes to kid that his wife says he usually plays the &quot;bad
guy&quot; because that way it really doesn't require any acting. He also
has authored three best selling books and numerous magazine articles and
is editor-in-chief of The Liddy Letter, a monthly newsletter.</P>

<P>But it is the practically overnight huge success of his radio talk show
that has propelled Liddy's name into the headlines in a way that it has
not been since Nixon was in the White House.</P>

<P>Liddy's program began on one radio station - WJFK in Washington, DC
- in February 1992 and immediately shot to the top of the Washington ratings.
In April 1993 the &quot;G. Gordon Liddy Show&quot; was launched as a nationally
syndicated radio program and awed the industry as the fastest talk show
launch in history, picking up 100 affiliates in as many days. That number
has hit more than 220 stations by now and is still rising.</P>

<P>The reason for his success is obvious. He approached the hot topics
addressed on his program in a frank, outspoken manner; gives callers who
disagree a chance to voice their opinions without ridicule; and displays
a keen sense of humor-such as referring to The Washington Post as The Washington
Bleep, as if its real name is too obscene to say on radio. In short, Liddy
comes across as more in love with life and ideas than himself.</P>

<P>One thing he clearly is not in love with is the BATF. When I noted that
his dislike of BATF clearly predates the Waco incident, Liddy replied,
&quot;That's because when I arrived in Washington in '69 as a special assistant
to the Secretary of the Treasury, I had duties in the area of gun control.</P>

<P>&quot;I was actually under the assistant secretary (for enforcement)
Gene Rossides, at the time. Gene didn't know which end of the tube a round
came out of. He was a city boy from New York. I took care of all that for
him.</P>

<P>&quot;The first thing I knew we were terribly embarrassed by the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. There was the Ken Bellew incident (the
shooting of an innocent gunowner), and it just went downhill from there.</P>

<P>&quot;BATF had made this motion picture on the Gun Control Act of 1968
that was the most ridiculous thing that I had ever seen. We tried to round
up every copy of that thing that we could and destroy it because it was
a distortion of the law. It also was quite anti-gun.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then there was the famous incident after I was the primary author
of the Explosives Control Act,&quot; Liddy added. &quot;That was given
to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to administer.</P>

<P>&quot;They said, 'All right, we're going to have a big press do.'</P>

<P>&quot;They had gotten a brand new scientific van-sort of a mobile laboratory.
They said, 'You go down there where they are going to blow up an outhouse
or something. Life magazine and everybody is going to be down there. They're
going to film it.'</P>

<P>&quot;And I said, 'Why do I have to go down there?'</P>

<P>&quot;They said, 'Well, they might have some question on the law. You
wrote the law, so you should down there and just field those questions.'</P>

<P>&quot;So I went down there, and I was just hanging out by the van because
I didn't want any part of blowing up the outhouse. I figured this crew
would probably blow me up-and themselves by mistake.</P>

<P>&quot;They came to get the van and said, 'We're going to take the van.'</P>

<P>&quot;I said, 'Where do you think you are going to go with that?'</P>

<P>&quot;They said, 'We're going to go down there with the press and they're
going to film the thing.'</P>

<P>&quot;I said, 'No you're not.'</P>

<P>&quot;They said,'Why not?'</P>

<P>&quot;I said, 'Well, look at the side of it.'</P>

<P>&quot;They had just put their big logo on there -Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms; and they had misspelled 'firearms.' And I didn't
want to embarrass the Treasury further.&quot;</P>

<P>When asked if he had caught any flak for urging people not to obey gun
laws that violate their Second Amendment rights, Liddy responded, &quot;An
occasional person will disagree with me. But that's it. Whatever flak could
I catch?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's a free country. They can't come and take my guns away. I
don't have any. (As a convicted felon, he is not allowed to own any firearms.)</P>

<P>&quot;I don't have any guns, don't have any licenses. &quot;And I go
to gun shows, but I carefully don't buy anything. I just look.&quot;</P>

<P>As any listener to his program knows, Liddy is equally critical of President
Clinton. He says he knows why Clinton has shown such fervor in his drive
to ban assault weapons.</P>

<P>&quot;Because Clinton - having proved a coward when it was his turn
to serve - is unfamiliar with these weapons,&quot; Liddy said. &quot;He
really doesn't know what an assault weapon is.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The weapons look military. Anything that even looks military scares
a guy like Billy Boy Clinton. And so they demonize them because of their
military appearance.</P>

<P>&quot;You and I know how you can get a good bolt-action high powered
rifle and you can go through a heck of a lot more than you can with a medium-powered,
so called assault weapon.</P>

<P>&quot;And if you really want to do some damage, get yourself a cylinder
bore 12-guage shotgun with 00 buck. But they wouldn't think of banning
that.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, no. They're going to ban this other thing because it's got
a bayonet lug, and we've got to stop all those drive-by bayonetings that
are happening.&quot;</P>

<P>Liddy said he does expect the Republican controlled Congress to attempt
to remove at least some of the anti-gun measures from the Crime Bill.</P>

<P>But he added, &quot;You've got to remember that Clinton - at least for
the next two years - is still the President of the United Sates. He can
veto.</P>

<P>&quot;So I think the tactic probably will be to take out some of the
more absurd stuff-like magazine capacity. At least, this would be my suggestion.</P>

<P>&quot;When they come across a bill that Clinton desperately needs and
wants, just put that magazine capacity thing on it and say, 'Take it or
leave it.'&quot;</P>

<P>There's no doubt in Liddy's mind that the Second Amendment guarantees
an individual right to keep and bear arms, despite the claims of groups
like the American Bar Association (ABA).</P>

<P>&quot;The American Bar Association on this-as on so many issues-is full
of beans. It is quite clear and the courts have held that it's an individual
right...</P>

<P>&quot;The thing I like about the Founding Fathers is that they were
master craftsmen with the English language. The reason they said 'shall
not be infringed' is that they were recognizing that as a free human being,
one of the rights you are endowed with by your creator is to be armed.
&quot;And they simply said we-in forming the government and having this
Constitution-will not infringe that. Period. It's not to be infringed.
ANy anything that contravenes that contravenes the Constitution.</P>

<P>&quot;So I just tell people it's unconstitutional. You no more should
obey that law than you should obey a law that says if you're black, go
to the back of the bus.&quot;</P>

<P>As a former Army artillery officer, special agent of the FBI, international
lawyer and a prosecutor, Liddy has more than a passing interest in firearms.
He loves to shoot. And what does he shoot?</P>

<P>&quot;It's more a matter of what I don't shoot,&quot; Liddy said. &quot;I
like handguns the most. All the handguns I shoot are owned by Mrs. Liddy.
I don't own any. I cannot legally do so in as much as I have felony convictions
on my record.</P>

<P>&quot;But occasionally I'll go out to the range with Mrs. Liddy and
with other friends-private ranges usually, over in Virginia. We all shoot
and we interchange the various firearms that are owned by the people who
are attending the shoot. We all share and share alike.</P>

<P>&quot;I've fired everything. My favorite for target is the .38 wadcutter,
mid-range, which I fire out of a Smith &amp; Wesson Combat Masterpiece
with a target trigger and a target hammer spur-broad-hammer spur. It's
got a ramp-front sight and adjustable rear sights.</P>

<P>&quot;Similarly with .357 Magnums.</P>

<P>&quot;A .45 Model 1911. That's the straight back that was carried in
the First World War by my grandfather, which is now owned by Mrs. Liddy.</P>

<P>&quot;A 9mm parabellum P-35 Browning Highpower, Mrs. Liddy has that
also.</P>

<P>&quot;Similar pieces owned by friends, all the way up to fully automatic
weapons legally owned by friends.</P>

<P>&quot;We fire high power rifles.</P>

<P>&quot;And shotguns. I like trap over skeet, but I've shot both. I haven't
done this new sporting clays stuff. It's very popular. I keep hearing about
it, but I have yet to shoot it.</P>

<P>&quot;I've fired-owned by various members of my family-AR-15's, H-Bars,
the M-1A (which is the semi-automatic version of the M-14) and the Garand,
which was the piece that I was trained with. When I went into the service,
that was the standard issue.</P>

<P>&quot;I guess you would call it the main battle rifle now to try to
distinguish it from an assault weapon. Of course, I understand a true assault
weapon is one capable of fully automatic fire with the flip of a selector
switch.</P>

<P>&quot;You name it, and I've probably fired it.&quot;</P>

<P>But will future generations of Americans be able to enjoy this same
sport? Will Americans have a right to keep and bear arms 50 years from
now?</P>

<P>&quot;Yes!&quot; Liddy declares emphatically. &quot;There's the Constitution.
The only way you can take that away from us is to amend the Constitution.</P>

<P>&quot;What the American people have to do is keep control of Congress-especially
the Senate, keep control of the White House, get the right Supreme Court
justices in there and be as damm sure on this, as people are on other touchstone
issues.</P>

<P>&quot;If worse comes to worse, what you can do is you can restrict the
jurisdiction on this issue of the Supreme Court. Congress has the right
to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.&quot;</P>

<P>Liddy said the recent elections encourage his belief that Americans
are waking up to the threat to their Second Amendment rights.</P>

<P>&quot;The gun issue was a big, big issue in these elections,&quot; Liddy
said, &quot;They (the anti-gunners) have gone too far.</P>

<P>&quot;And, of course, you've had all this horrible stuff: the out-of-control
FBI hostage rescue team and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
making war on the American people.</P>

<P>&quot;I'd like to see a big push to investigate and find out how much
assistance those people were given by the armed forces. That's a violation
of the Posse Comitatus Act.</P>

<P>&quot;I'd like to stop all armed forces participation with law enforcement.
That shouldn't be happening.&quot;</P>

<P>The French newspaper Le Monde once labeled Liddy &quot;a man of extraordinary
intellect and complexity,&quot; an appropriate description for a man who,
at age 29, became the youngest Bureau supervisor at FBI national headquarters.</P>

<P>William F. Buckley Jr. described Liddy as possessing &quot;superhuman
character,&quot; while historian William H. White labeled him &quot;the
most dangerous man in America.&quot;</P>

<P>Liberal television talk show host Larry King said of Liddy, &quot;He's
totally himself, totally honest...He has passion, flair. He's just extraordinary.
A man's man.&quot;</P>

<P>But whatever else this bright extremely successful, strong willed person
is, G. Gordon Liddy clearly is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms'
worst nightmare.</P>

<P>Down to Earth UFO Abduction Research</P>

<P>An Interview with Budd Hopkins</P>

<P>by Kerri Parry</P>

<P>from the Wole Life Times April 1995 supplied by The P/\NTHER</P>

<P>Picture this: You're minding your own business, driving down the street
towards home when up above, you see a silver aircraft hovering-definitely
not a helicopter or anything you've ever seen before-with flicking, colored
lights. You stop and turn down your radio to see if it makes any noise.</P>

<P>The next thing you remember, it's dark out and you're driving down the
street again. You look at your watch: it's 9pm. You should have been home
hours ago.</P>

<P>What happened? According to Budd Hopkins, you may have been abducted
by UFOs. Called &quot;Ufology's most visible figure since the death of
J. Allen Hynek, &quot;this abduction researcher described such scenarios
in his 1981 book Missing Time and went on to explore the subject of alien/human
hybirds in the 1987 book Intruders (the subject of a CBS television miniseries
in 1992), books that were devoted to findings from his painstaking research
into UFO abductions. With help from a fellow UFO researcher and psychologist,
Hopkins performed countless interviews and hypnosis sessions on UFO abductees
to form case studies. What they found was not pleasant: involuntary human
subjects were subjected to implants and sperm and ova sampling, among other
things. Mothers were shown their half-human, half-alien children.</P>

<P>Also a New York City painter and sculptor, Hopkins has founded the Intruders
Foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to research and public education
about the UFO abduction phenomenon. Whole Life Times spoke with Hopkins
about his work.</P>

<P>* BEGIN INTERVIEW *</P>

<P>[Your last book, Intruders, came out in 1987. What has been the focus
of your research since then?]</P>

<P>Essentially what the focus was before-studying the abduction phenomenon
and looking for patterns that were unknown before. There have been a number
of these new patterns, and they have certainly occupied a lot of my thinking
since then. These might be called &quot;subsets&quot; because they're not
all that common, but there are some 12 cases where people have been abducted
as children and taken into another place, another situation with another
child. They are simply left alone to play and form relationships, and they're
abducted again and again. They may live in different cities; in one case
they lived on different continents. They are brought together and, it would
seem, the aliens are interested in watching how a relationship forms, between,
in most cases, members of the opposite sex.</P>

<P>What happens eventually in the cases I'm dealing with is the people
have actually run into their counterpart in the real world and thought,
&quot;My god, how do I know you?&quot; When you look into these cases,
it turns out they've been abducted and studied as a pair. So as a sort
of extension of the UFO occupants' interest in reproduction and this program
of mixing hybirds of them and us, they seem to be interested in how human
beings experience certain types of emotions. That's never been written
about in any length, but it's something I've run into a number of times.</P>

<P>[Why do you think certain individuals are chosen as abductees? Is it
random?]</P>

<P>People seem to be chosen across certain blood lines and families. If
a woman is an abductee and has two children, it is likely that one or more
of her children will also be abductees. I have cases which go across four
generations. So it would seem there is this interest in following a particular
set of genes and its various permutations. We don't really know, but that's
a good guess. If people are abducted when they are tiny children-I have
one case where a baby was taken from the hospital when it was one day old-if
these things happen from childhood on, then obviously whatever they're
interested in is already present in that child to start with.</P>

<P>[What are some of the symptoms by which one might recognize a personal
abduction experience?]</P>

<P>The most obvious sympton is having a very clear, conscious memory of
abduction. Now to go to the much more subtle: childhood sleep difficulties,
recurring nightmares which have a UFO component to them, fears of certain
places, certain kinds of phobias which don't make much sense. One man was
afraid to go out at night and walk into any kind of open field because
he was afraid he would &quot;fall up.&quot;</P>

<P>Another person might say he's absolutely terrified of cockroaches, and
I'll say, &quot;Well, they're certainly not pleasant; you're afraid they'll
get into your food,&quot; and then try to lead away, not using anything
UFO-like. Then he'll say, &quot;No, their huge staring eyes, and the way
they stare at you,&quot; which is not the way we thing about cockroaches!</P>

<P>If you look at this as a medical metaphor, like a high fever or an itch
on the kneecap, you name it, any symptom alone could be anything. But in
conjunction with, say, six other symptoms, you have to take it seriously
as perhaps being representative of a certain pathology.</P>

<P>[Then how do you determine if it's the bona fide thing?]</P>

<P>Well, I would then examine a person's collection of his phobias and
fears, and try to find out if a person has had any missing time experiences
that are unexplained. An example might be a trip in the car that is supposed
to take an hour and it takes three hours and he can't remember anything,
but he feels real funny!</P>

<P>Then I make inquiries into his dream life. People very often have this
unbelievable fear of going to a doctor, gynecological exam, or the dentist-fears
that are in excess of what they could understand as being logical. Soem
of what one does ina n interview is inquire into many different areas of
a person's expericnce and see what kinds of symptomns recur.</P>

<P>I've done a lot of work with children who were abductees, and when you're
working with children, I ask a different set of questions. One man remembered
that as a little boy, when his mother pointed out a praying mantis, he
started talking to it. His mother said, &quot;Bugs don't talk.&quot; He
said, &quot;No, this kind of bug talks!&quot; Another little boy made some
drawings of aliens and put a huge ear, just one ear, on the side of each
head. He said, &quot;They don't really have ears, but they can hear everything
you're saying.&quot;</P>

<P>[Do the abductions seem to happen only by &quot;grey&quot; aliens?]</P>

<P>There are other types that are described. Some seem to have a more insect-like
appearance; some people use the analogy of a praying mantis. Essentially,
you see the gray figures in 85% of the reports. There's a number of reports
of what seem to be normal humans and also people who seem to be hybirds:
part human, part alien. But they all seem, together, to be doing the same
thing.</P>

<P>[They all want to observe you, or put in an implant...]</P>

<P>Yes, implants, or alleged implants, have been found. A number of them
have been studied, and they are quite unusual, but they are not something
all science would agree could not have been produced on earth. The problem
is that all the elements on Earth are the elements of the Universe, and
how would we recognize an object that could not possibly have originated
on Earth? An implant could be made of earthly materials, so how do we recognize
it? It's not as easy an issue as one would imagine.</P>

<P>[In Intruders you surmised that the abduction phenomenon could either
be reality or a soft of universal psychological phenomenon. Have you come
any further in deciding which it is?]</P>

<P>I don't have any doubt that it's physically real. Somebody asked me
once, &quot;Is this really happening in the real world?&quot; I said, &quot;I
no longer have the luxury of disbelief about it.&quot; We're stuck with
it. It's not very pleasant to deal with. One thing I want to say that's
important is that though we know it's going on, and we know that they're
doing, at least an awful lot of them, we don't know any of the answers
to any of the big questions-like what's it going to be like 100 years from
now, where do they come from, what do they ultimately intend for us? We
don't have any of those answers. When somebody once said, &quot;This is
like a cult,&quot; I said, &quot;Well, it's the exact opposite of a cult,
if you think of a cult as the Rev. Moon or something like that. Moonies
are all beliefs and no miracles. We're all miracles and no beliefs.&quot;</P>

<P>And, I must say, I'm not given a lot of speculation. For me, it's a
lot of wheel-spinning. So when people start talking, &quot;Oh, I hink they're
time travelers, &quot;No, I think they're inter-dimensionals,&quot; I just
sort of throw up my hands and say, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</P>

<P>[Besides abductees and researchers such as yourself, is anyone else
showing concern over this phenomenon?]</P>

<P>Mental health professionals, as a group, have had a larger percentage
taking this issue very seriously than any other group that I'm aware of.
I've spoken to maybe 1,000 mental health professionals over the years and
apart from the fact that I've so far had seven psychiatrists come to me
about their own abduction experiences-and a number of psychologists and
therapists that are abductees-it seems to be, as a group, that many of
them share a great interest in this subject. I think it's because they're
very aware of the anomalies of human behavior. If you have people who are
showing signs of, say, childhood sexual abuse, and there's absolutely no
sexual abuse that can be located in anyone in the family, and the child
remembers certain things that blend with memories that have to do with
the realm of huge black eyes and finding oneself outside and a whole group
of things, the mental health people are aware that maybe there is an unusual
phenomena at work here that's outside of their normal range of training
and expertise. But we certainly hear more from them that we do from, say,
physicists or astronomers who are the first to say you can't get here from
there, or &quot;These people's experiences can't be!&quot;</P>

<P>[What about the government?]</P>

<P>Well, we know there's a cover-up on this. I don't think ther's any doubt,
because the government was investigating UFOs through the Air Force officially
up until 1969, and then they announced they were getting out of looking
into the subject at all. But when the Freedom of Information Act was passed
and we requested documents, we received many documents from all the branches
of government, at least the investigative ones, dealing with UFO investigatino
carried out after 1969. You can't say you're stopping it, and then have
all this evidence that you're not stopping it without saying that is, ipso
facto, a kind of cover-up.</P>

<P>[Tell us about the organizatino you founded, the Intruders Foundation.]</P>

<P>There are three different things we do. One is working with abductees
and referring them to other investigators and therapists around the country,
and a few in foreign countries. I'm still getting about two new potential
cases a day, and the first thing we do is get these people some help, because
they want to find out what happened to them. If hypnosis or therapy is
called for, we try to get some help. The second thing is research, trying
to put together the accounts of what's happening and determining the patterns,
what keeps happening again and again. The third thing is public education.</P>

<P>[In terms of popular culture, it seems like UFOs are coming more into
the mainstream. We're seeing more movies, more television shows and so
forth, devoted to the topic. Any thoughts on this?]</P>

<P>I think the reason is that the media is out to make a buck. There's
public interest in it, which means money, and therefore they're catering
to that. It's an interesting thing: when sweeps week comes along, everybody
calls me up and wants to do UFO this, UFO that. That lets you know that
there's an audience in it.</P>

<P>&quot;Since the show started, people have sought me out. I was warned
about nutcases but these are regular folks. A banker will tell about his
experience with aliens. Pilots and flight attendants come up to me and
claim to have seen UFOs. One friend told me, 'You don't know how accurate
you are.' He broke down, telling me about his visitations. I've known this

her, struding past a Panavision camera into a hallway at a studio in Vancouver.
He slumps in a canvas chair and grabs a reporter's notebook. He starts
drawing something on the page. &quot;You won't admit that you're really
going to be writing what amounts to fiction,&quot; he says. &quot;It's
going to have your slant on it-not the truth. You're just trying to get
a handle on something, a handle on me.&quot; The notebook is retrieved.
The drawing is a bag with a handle on it. Next to the handle he has drawn
an arrow pointing to his real name: David Duchovny.</P>

<P>So when it comes to investigating the most provocative series on TV,
Fox's sleeper sci-fi hit, The X-Files, Duchovny seems to be echoing the
show's credo: The truth is out there-but it's not likely to be in here,
in the pages of a magazine. Or is it?</P>

<P>Since it's first sighting in 1993, The X-Files has defied skeptics who
refused to believe that a show about two deadpan FBI agents, played by
Duchovny, 34, and Gillian Anderson, 26, investigating paranormal activities
could succeed. But succeed it has. By skillfully blending post-Cold War,
antigovernment paranoia; old-fashioned conspiracy theory; sly humor; and
stories drawn from today's headlines (not to mention little green men and
beast-women), The X-Files beat out favorites like NYPD Blue and ER for
best drama series at the recent Golden Globes. Ratings have nearly doubled
since its debut, culminating in its first-ever-time-slow victory in households
with the conclusion of a recent two parter about the supposed return of
Mulder's sister, a story suggested in part by Duchovny&gt; &quot;I had
no idea this could happen,&quot; says the Hollywood-handsome Carter, 38,
a former surfing-magazine writer whose favorite should as a kid was Kolchak:
The Night Stalker. &quot;I wrote this in my office in my surf trunks, playing
with my dog. It never occurred to me that someday there'd be X-Files key
chains.&quot;</P>

<P>True, the show is beset by at least on Dark Force. Many X-Files episodes
are left unresolved, making them a hard sell in syndication. So Carter
too must battle strange life forms-the kind who wear Armani suits and dine
at Mortons. &quot;We have long, tedious arguments about the network's desire
for 'closure',&quot; sighs Carter. &quot;But it's hard to put handcuffs
on aliens every week and throw them in the slammer.&quot;</P>

<P>Nevertheless, all signs point to a possible Star Trek-like franchise.
The first X-Files convention will be held soon, probably in L.A.; a series
of official X-Files novels is hitting bookstores; Topps Comics is putting
out a monthly X-Files comic book; and Fox will release an X-Files CD later
this year. The phenom has also infiltrated cyberspace. Thousands of fans-they
call themselves &quot;X-Philes&quot; - have logged onto X-Files newsgroups
on the Internet and online services; America Online even lets subscribers
role-play in a game based on the series.</P>

<P>&quot;My dorm when I was studying in Munich was an old SS barracks that
was supposedly haunted. One night we were sitting around, making fun of
the spirits. At some point I went back to my room. There was a big brass
candlabra on the dresser. I knelt down to get into the closet and the candlabra
came crashing down and just missed my head. It was on a totally flat surface.
Nothing could have knocked it over. It was very weird. I apologized to
the spirits immediately.&quot; - Mitch Pileggi,a.k.a. X-Files FBI assistant
director Walter Skinner</P>

<P>Marooned for 10 months of the year in Vancouver, where they work under
such tight deadlines that some scripts have been written in less than 72
hours, Team X-Files find the show's exploding popularity a little, well,
suspicious. &quot;I'm fascinated by what they read into it,&quot; says
director-producer Rob Bowman, 34, who surfs on those often arcane X-Files
forums in cyberspace where viewers dig for signs and symbols in nearly
every scene. &quot;We don't have time to put in everything they think they
see.&quot;</P>

<P>Die-hard fans analyze and critique the show, expecially the sinister
fringe characters, such as Deep Throat, Mr. X, Cigarette Smoking Man, or
Crew Cut Man, like Talmudic scholars. A typical America Online posting
after a recent episode read: &quot;Did any other Douglas Adams [Hitchkiker's
Guide to the Galaxy] fans out there notice that Mulder's apartment number
is 42? It's the answer to the question of Life, the Universe and Everything.&quot;</P>

<P>Another hot topic is the soulful but platonic relationship between Fox
Mulder and Dana Scully. X-Philes swoon over the sexual tension, but Carter
swears his two stars will never have a close encounter of the sensual kind.
&quot;If they ever got too romantic,&quot; he says, &quot;you can imagine
them ignoring the aliens and genetic mutants and just staring into each
other's eyes.&quot;</P>

<P>The X-Files sometimes twist its more obsessive viewers. In one episode,
the three greasy-haired conspiracy theorist losers known as the Lone Gunmen
invite Mulder for an uproarious Saturday night &quot;netpicking&quot; on
the Internet. &quot;No thanks,&quot; the agent responds dryly in one of
his trademark Mulderisms, &quot;I have to do my laundry.&quot;</P>

<P>Of course, when it comes to the X-Files, one should remember the immortal
words of Mulder's mysterious ally (or is it enemy?) Deep Throat, who died
(or did he?) at the end of last season: &quot;Nothing is as it seems.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My mother was raised by her uncle and they were very close. One
day, after she was grown up, her uncle died. That very day she'd written
him a letter and mailed it to him. [After learning that he'd died] she
went back to his house and went through his private papers. She found her
letter had been opened. And there was no one else who could have been there
to open it.&quot;-Tom Braidwood, a.k.a. one of the Lone Gunmen.</P>

<P>Both Duchovny, who has Mulder's dry wit and sardonic delivery, and Anderson,
who can be as eerily serene as her X-Files character, Dana Scully, work
up to 16 hours a day. Duchovny is a veteren of films like Kalifornia and
played the transvetite on Twin Peaks. Anderson, however, only had a few
stage and TV credits when the show began. They rarely socialize together
only &quot;because we see more of each other working than we do of anyone
else,&quot; says Anderson. Duchovny, alternately charming and brusque,
spends his free time in his spartan trailer with his dog, Blue. Anderson
dashes back to her trailer in between takes to be with her 5-month-old-daughter;
Piper.</P>

<P>On the show, Duchovny's character is the true believer: Mulder's quest
to find his sister, who he believes was abducted by aliens at age 8, drives
the show. (Carter says the sister will finally be found whenever the show
ends its run.) In real life, however, Duchovny is more of a doubter-at
times. &quot;I'm a skeptic of specifics, like the six-foot intestinal worm[in
the episode 'The Host'],&quot; he says.</P>

<P>Anderson, by contrast, who plays the pragmatic, scientific, ever-skeptical
Scully, says she's &quot;always had a basic belief in the paranormal.&quot;
Not long after arriving in Vancouver, she had even more reason to believe.</P>

<P>&quot;After my husband and I moved into our new house, I feld there
were spirits there with us. It was really creepy. It felt like there was
someone attached to me. We were told by a Native American that we lived
near an Indian burial ground. He said there had been a plague years ago
that wiped many of them out. There were a lot of souls in unrest. He came
to the house and performed this ritual called smudging in which herbs are
burned so as to purify the space. It was amazing. Afterward, it was like
the house got lighter. Whatever we felt had been there was gone.&quot;-Gillian
Anderson</P>

<P>Sounding very much like Scully describing Mulder, Anderson admits, &quot;We
have our ups and downs. At times it's difficult. We both tend to be quite
moody, but underneath I think we care about each other.&quot; They are
both coy about whether they ever considered dating, but Anderson will allow
that Duchovny is &quot;like catnip&quot; to women. When told this later,
Duchovny, soon to be featured in a Playgirl interview, notes. &quot;Just
call me David Ducatnip,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish I had the life people
think I have.&quot;</P>

<P>Unlike Mulder and Scully, who seem to have virtually no personal lives,
Duchovny and Anderson found mates soon after the show's debut. Duchovny's
L.A.-based girlfriend, actress Perrey Reeves, played a beautiful vampire
who spends the night with Mulder int he episode titled &quot;3&quot;. Anderson
married Errol Clyde Klotz, 33, a freelance art director on the show, four
months after meeting him and gave birth in September. &quot;It was intense,
everyone was mad at me,&quot; says Anderson of her pregnancy. &quot;It
was pretty ballsy of me, after getting such a big break. I was afraid they
were going to recast.&quot;</P>

<P>Instead, Anderson's abscence from the show led to one of its most compelling
storeis-last year's two-parter in which it seems that Scully is abducted
by aliens. Anderson returned to work 10 days after giving birth by cesarean
section. &quot;It was tough,&quot; she says, &quot;but now I have a beautiful
baby daughter.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I was in Ocean City, Maryland, in 1987. I looked up and saw something
that looked like a plane. I looked away for a second and it was gone. It
was low and big. I couldn't believe my eyes. I just glanced away for a
second and when I looked back it was gone.&quot;-David Duchovny</P>

<P>Duchovny, having morphed back into Mulder, is again in front of the
cameras. His &quot;sister&quot; (soon to be revealed as an impostor with
four clones) is warning him about an alien bounty hunter. Just a few feet
away, behind the set's fake backwall, a member of the production team speaks
in low, confidential tones.</P>

<P>This person, who does not want to be identified, talks guardedly about
what she says was her own abduction by aliens late last year: &quot;They
took us up in their ship,&quot; she says. &quot;It's hazy, it's hard to
remember, like a dream. They spoke, but it seemed like everything happened
telepathically. I do remember they had three fingers.&quot;</P>

<P>Duchovny, between scenes, pops out again and listens to the conversation
skeptically. &quot;On the other side of the wall, the sign above Mulder's
desk reads, &quot;I want to believe.&quot; You do too. But then you remember
the rule: Trust no one.</P>

<P>Monster in the Wilderness</P>

<P>by C. Zickuhr</P>

<P>The HAARP project being constructed near Gakona, Alaska will create
the largest-of-its-kind ionospheric heater using computer controlled radio
frequency transmitters. HAARP, which stands for High Frequency Active Auroral
Research Project, is a joint effort of the Air Force and the Navy. HAARP
program manager, John Heckscher, claims that it is a research project with
both military and civilian benefits yet only military experiments can be
found in the documentation for the project. The acronym implies something
to do with the aurora, but none of the project papers mention that aspect.
What sounds like an engineering feat deserving of public accolade, has
remained suspiciously low profile, almost unknown to most Alaskans as well
as the rest of the country.</P>

<P>Documents acquired from the Office of Naval Research via the Freedom
Of Information Act reveal a more ominous purpose for HAARP. According to
these documents, the U.S. military believes the former Soviet Union has
similar heaters with which they claim to have achieved higher levels of
ionospheric reaction than possible so far in the &quot;West&quot;. Although
smaller in size than the HAARP project, there are many other ground based
transmitting heaters in operation around the world; Tromso, Norway and
Arecibo, Puerto Rico among them. Can these heaters already be changing
the weather, and have they somehow contributed to the recent climate-based
catastrophes in the U.S? Might migratory species traveling through the
&quot;rays&quot; have already experienced irreversible damage? How many
humans have contracted cancers that might have remained dormant if not
&quot;excited&quot; by these transmissions? When Russia's Zhirinovsky speaks
of secret weapons, is he referring to their version of HAARP?</P>

<P>HAARP first came to my attention in the spring of 1993, when a neighbor
and airline pilot brought me materials on the project. The FAA had briefed
commercial pilots in Alaska on changes needed to avoid interference from
future HAARP transmissions. As a ham radio operator, my neighbor assumed
that I had some knowledge of the &quot;giant transmitter&quot; and its
effect on other communications. After making inquiries to other hams, a
few recalled seeing announcements for public meetings in Glenallen and
Anderson, Alaska. Several then attended these Draft Environmental Impact
meetings and gathered information.</P>

<P>FAA personnel, pilots, communications engineers and others raised serious
questions during the HAARP Draft Environmental Impact Statement process.
According to official statements, these questions were all properly addressed
in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). Closer examination
reveals a different story. Local FAA engineers, aware of the heavy safety
dependency of airplane communications, voiced strong objections. The national
FAA, however, overrode these objections and gave HAARP the green light
after &quot;assurances&quot; that lower level concerns would be accommodated.
The FEIS admits that all forms of radio communication are subject to interference,
yet completely ignores the concerns expressed in many of the comments.
Individuals, organizations and agencies that use radio for their day-to-day
livelihood were left with a &quot;let us know and we'll try to mitigate
it&quot; promise. It is important to remember the definition of mitigation
is &quot;to reduce&quot;, not &quot;to eliminate&quot;. What recourse does
the Alaskan Bush communicator have when their radio transmissions are rendered
useless by HAARP? That is their only form of communication.</P>

<P>The FEIS and other Department of Defense documents indicate that interference
problems would be too great to allow it to be located near other military
facilities in Alaska. What kind of monster is it that they can't even locate
it near existing military bases? Even the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA) has reservations about HAARP transmissions.
They would only permit one of the test sites (Mineral Wells, Texas) to
operate and so far have declined to extend all the requested frequency/power
privileges necessary for the Alaska site. The enormous lobbying power of
the military may overwhelm reason and force the NTIA to go along with the
HAARP request. After all, Gakona is a &quot;virtually uninhabited&quot;
area of the world.</P>

<P>Electromagnetic radiation has drawn increasing interest in the form
of health impact studies and research worldwide. The HAARP project will
generate massive amounts of intentional and some unintentional radiation.
The HAARP environmental impact statements deny possible biological effects
on humans, citing obsolete IEEE standards that basically say if the radiation
isn't causing you to feel heat, it does not harm you. The preponderance
of current studies indicate there can by promotion of cancer growth, disorientation,
and other negative physical effects from low level, non-heating electromagnetic
radiation. Why have our government agencies given their affirmation to
something so clearly controversial?</P>

<P>After searching for answers to HAARP questions for the past year and
a half, what has surfaced are very few answers and many more questions.
How dangerous is HAARP (some physicists fear severe planetary consequences)?
Commenting on HAARP in the April, 1994 issue of Physics and Society, C.
L. Herzenberg says &quot;...this technology does present issues that need
to be publicly addressed by the technical community&quot;. Can HAARP change
the ionosphere and weather patterns?? Can HAARP disrupt worldwide communications??
Can HAARP damage or destroy wildlife?? Will HAARP radiation change the
migration habits of animals that come near it?? Can HAARP cause cancer??
Can the ionospheric effects of HAARP be controlled?? Why has the project
been kept low profile and secretive, by the sponsors and the contractor
(an ARCO subsidiary)?</P>

<P>UPDATE: JUNE 1994 - ARCO sold their subsidiary to E-Systems, the 41st
largest U.S. defense contractor noted for their counter surveillance work.
Why have Alaska's public officials avoided providing serious answers to
the public's questions?? Anything that can generate these questions deserves
the MONSTER title and our serious attention.</P>

<P>Additional pieces to the puzzle that have shown themselves only serve
to heighten speculation that we are not getting clear and concise answers.
There is a connection to the recently installed Cray supercomputer at UAF
and to the Geophysical Institute there. There is an obvious power requirement
that might be met by a proposed coal power plant at Healy, connected by
a proposed power distribution intertie. Some of the experiments will require
&quot;seeding&quot; the ionosphere with chemicals that could be delivered
by rockets from the Poker Flats rocket range near Fairbanks. Patents held
by the ARCO subsidiary building HAARP describe a similar ionospheric heater
and claim abilities to stop missiles, change weather, and disrupt global
communications. The inventor, Bernard Eastlund, claims he was hired by
ARCO to find a use for their Alaska North Slope gas deposits; hence, his
inventions described in the patents. Microwave News May/June, 1994 reported
Eastlund said &quot;The HAARP project obviously looks a lot like the first
step toward this.&quot;</P>

<P>The Gakona location is interesting as it was once destined to become
an over-the-horizon radar facility. The Cold War ended before it could
be completely built. This left the military with a remote location with
buildings and generating equipment partially completed, and a choice -
either restore it to its original natural condition or find another use.
HAARP conveniently fits the site. Is the choice of this remote site for
these monster transmitters more a factor of fewer people to complain? Does
it reduce the number of humans exposed to HAARP transmissions thereby reducing
the liability? What about the wildlife in the area, what exposures will
they be subjected to? One need only remember experiments of another era
that generated nuclear fall-out killing and crippling humans and animals
in its path. It only took forty to fifty years to get the agencies involved
to admit liability.</P>

<P>In order to get an idea of just how large the HAARP transmitters are,
imagine all the ham radio operators in the United States (there are over
500,000) transmitting at their maximum allowed power from one giant antenna.
That still would not be as powerful as HAARP's multi-gigawatt (giga = billion)
radiation capability. The average Alaskan ham can communicate across the
state with less power than will be in the unintentional harmonics and side-lobes
radiated by HAARP.</P>

<P>What exactly will HAARP do? According to HAARP project documents it
will &quot;perturb&quot; the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of
energy. Using polarized, pulsating radio frequency transmissions to perform
experiments which include devising methods to destroy the communications
capabilities of others (presumably an adversary) while preserving their
own communications. Experiments with mirroring and reflecting abilities
of the ionosphere (abilities we currently depend on for all forms of communication)
will be carried out to see what military purposes may be served by the
resulting changes. An apt analogy that springs to mind is that of an inquisitive
youngster poking a sleeping bear with a stick, to see what might happen!
What will we do once the monster is unleashed?</P>

<P>The Alaska location was partially picked for its alignment with the
earth's magnetic force lines. Military experiments with the magnetosphere
also appear to be planned. And again the scientists warn of possible dire
consequences, including setting the earth into some unexpected vibration
or oscillation, similar to an axis wobble. Many scientists such as Richard
Williams writing in Physics and Society in April, 1988 have denounced this
kind of testing as irresponsible and downright dangerous, fearing long
term negative ionospheric effects. Also, like any magnet, the force lines
will react at their opposite pole, near Australia and New Zealand. Australians
are concerned enough to consider sending a team to Alaska to document and
investigate HAARP. Shouldn't Alaskans be interested too?</P>

<P>A group of NO HAARP activists is seeking to formalize their opposition
by incorporating as a non-profit organization or affiliating with an existing
group. Their prime purposes will be to promote awareness, file legal actions
and other activities focused specifically on HAARP, something no group
is currently doing. In fact, probably due to the remoteness of the Gakona
location, it has been difficult to get outsiders interested. We are quite
aware that the promoters of HAARP fully realize that they have the upper
organizational hand and the money to outlast our grassroots opposition.
Those of us in NO HAARP are committed to doing what we can to stop the
project before it comes on-line with full power in 1997. Considering the
project has been underway since the mid-1980's, this will be a difficult
task. Luckily it was not completely funded as of a year ago. There is hope
that legislative alternatives to stop it may exist as well. John Heckscher
was quoted by Microwave News in the May/June, 1994 issue saying that &quot;money
for completion of the demonstration project is in place . . . but the larger
facility would require additional funding from Congress&quot;. Unfortunately,
this additional funding is likely to be buried deep in the DOD budget.</P>

<P>What can you do? Of course you can try to &quot;write your congress
person&quot;. The Alaska delegation to congress is noted for their alignment
with the military so don't expect too much action from them. Send contributions
for the NO HAARP effort to Jim Roderick, P.O. Box 916, Homer, AK 99603.
You can lobby with the NTIA to turn down the HAARP frequency/power request.
You can make others aware of the HAARP project and the questions it raises.

<P>The OKLAHOMA BOMBING?</P>

<P>- The GODFATHER/UMF -</P>

<P>The Albert Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City collapsed into a
pile of rubble and torn bodies after explosions rippled its supports from
the foundation at approximately 9:02 am, Wednesday, April 19, 1995, the
second anniversary of the Waco massacre. Timothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran
has been arrested and charged with the crime. James and Terry Nichols,
brothers, have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to build explosive
devices at James' farm in Michigan. McVeigh and Terry Nichols were army
buddies. Casualties as of May 5th stand at 164 dead. Fifteen of them children.
Seventeen remain unidentified. The total number of injured is in excess
of 400. There are still 2 adults unaccounted for and it is feared that
they will never be found. Assistant Firechief Hansen has announced that
the clean- up of the bombsite is officially over. Rescuers wept silently
at the announcement. The reason for the bombing is still unknown. Use of
the term &quot;heartland&quot; to describe Oklahoma is right on the mark.
Oklahomans are American to the core. They are deeply religious, avid gun
owners, believe in a strict moral code, and have provided more than their
fair share of cannon fodder for the nation's wars. They are, for the most
part, honest and hard- working people from pioneer stock. Many live on
land their grandparents staked out in the great Oklahoma land rush. These
people are extremely loyal to their state and to their country. Oklahomans
knew all along where we were headed, and true to form, they tried to stop
the march toward globalism. these traits may have sealed Oklahoma's fate
on March 28, 1994 when the Oklahoma State Legislature passed a resolution
which struck out at Clinton's socialist world government agenda. They were
the first and maybe the only state to pass such legislation. *Resolution
No. 1047, 'A Resolution relating to United States military forces and the
United Nations; memorializing Congress to cease certain activities concerning
the United Nations; and directing distribution'</P>

<P>*WHEREAS, the constitutional role of the United States military is to
protect the life, liberty and property of United States citizens and to
defend our nation against insurrection or foreign invasion; and</P>

<P>*WHEREAS, there is no popular support for the establishment of a &quot;new
world order&quot; or world sovernty of any kind either under the United
Nations or under any world body in any form of global government; and</P>

<P>*WHEREAS, global government would mean the destruction of our Constitution
and corruption of the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, our freedom,
and our way of life.</P>

<P>*NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
2ND SESSION OF THE 44TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:</P>

<P>*THAT the United States Congress is hereby memorialized to: 1. Cease
the appropriation of United States funds for any military activity not
authorized by congress;</P>

<P>2. Cease engagement in any military activity under the authority of
the United Nations or any world body;</P>

<P>3. Cease the rendering of aid to any activity or engagement under the
jurisdiction of the United Nations or any world body; and</P>

<P>4. Cease any support for the establishment of a &quot;new world order&quot;
or to any form of global government.</P>

<P>*THAT the United States congress is hereby memorialized to refrain from
taking any further steps toward the economic or political merger of the
United States into a world body or any form of world government.</P>

<P>*That copies of this resolution be distributed to the Clerk of the United
States House of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States Senate,
and to each member of the Oklahoma Congressional Delegation.</P>

<P>*Adopted by the House of Representatives the 28th day of March, 1994</P>

<P>The resolution passed by the Oklahoma State had the support of all the
citizens of Oklahoma. It was a slap in the face to the Clinton administration
and all those who promote the Socialist Internationale. Those murdered
at Ruby Creek and Waco cried out for justice. Americans echoed those cries.
Everyone knew that something was terribly wrong. A police state was emerging
before our eyes. Militias were forming. The Democrats suffered the worst
defeat in their history at the polls in November. The hidden agenda of
the communist/socialist Internationale was being exposed to the public
through talk radio and a thriving underground autobahn of information.
This story really began on February 26, 1993 when the World Trade Center
was bombed in New York City. William Cooper (author of 'Behold a Pale Horse')
predicted terrorists would detonate a bomb in New York City since 1989.
It is on record, on video, tape, and in his book. He predicted that it
would be blamed on Islamic fundamentalists but the real perpetrators would
be the U.S. Intelligence Community and specifically the Central Intelligence
Agency. He did not venture to guess the target. Those arrested were linked
directly to the CIA and the FBI WAS implicated in the bombing. The perpetrators
used TWO megabombs carried in a YELLOW RYDER RENTAL VAN. The bombs exploded
in the parking garage of the World Trade Center, prematurely, before being
properly placed. The result was substantial damage. Five people were killed
and over 1,000 were wounded. If the bombs had been placed in position next
to the main structural supports the result would have been exactly what
we see in Oklahoma City only much worse. Fragments of the yellow van were
QUICKLY found in the rubble. A paper trail traced the vehicle to an outlet
in New Jersey where it was rented four days before the explosion. &quot;A
lucky breakthrough&quot; led federal agents to arrest a suspect, 26 year
old Mohammed Salameh, at the Jersey City rental agency at which he attempted
to reclaim a $400 dollar deposit on the van. In a surprise revelation Tony
Lang, a staff columnist for 'The Cincinnati Enquirer' (Gannett Chain) in
Cincinnati, Ohio, has uncovered court documents to support the direct involvement
of the FBI in the World Trade Center bombing. The papers, filed in May,
disclose that a government informer, an employee of the FBI, accompanied
the accused bomber, Mohammed Salameh, to a New Jersey apartment they used
as a bomb factory...and proceeded to INSTRUCT Salameh in how to drive the
famous van two days before the explosion! In another surprise development,
reported by Louis Beam in the 'Jubilee', tapes made secretly by an FBI
informant of conversations between him and his agency handlers linked the
nation's largest law enforcement agency directly to &quot;the most destructive
terrorist act in U.S. history&quot;. Unfortunately that title now rests
with Oklahoma City. Emid Ali Salem, an FBI informant used hidden microphones
given to him by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to record his conversations
with agents of the bureau. A Los Angeles Times article on October 28, 1993
revealed to shocked readers details of FBI involvement in the terrorist
act. FBI spokesmen in Washington refuse comment. The tapes became public
knowledge when they were ordered released by a federal judge presiding
over the case of the indicted suspects. The Justice Department fought hard
to prevent their release. The tapes which have been published by the New
York Times reveal that Salem warned his FBI bosses that the World Trade
Center was soon to be bombed and urged them to prevent it. Speculation
is now rampant in political circles that certain factions within the government
may have desired the bombing in order to speed passage of new &quot;anti-crime
legislation.&quot; This suspicion was further fueled by the startling revelation
that the FBI denied Salem's request to use phoney explosives in the bomb
he was helping to build under FBI supervision - the bomb ultimately used
in the World Trade Center explosion. Former Watergate associate prosecutor
Richard Ben-Veniste warned that these tapes pose &quot;an absolute nightmare
for federal prosecutors.&quot; One high ranking law enforcement officer
who insisted on secrecy said that in less than a years time the FBI has
been linked to criminal abuse of power and the mishandling of cases in
three different instances. &quot;First we had Weaver, where an HRT member
shot a mother with a baby in her arms, then Waco, where mishandling led
to the deaths of a hundred people, and now the World Trade Center, where
it appears the bombing could not have happened unless the agency let it.&quot;
All of this comes on the heels of an Internal affairs report by the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, linking FBI agents
to everything from drug abuse to shoplifting. OPR's annual report provided
further startling proof that the agency formally most respected for it's
law enforcement skills - &quot;has gone bad.&quot; This contention is backed
up by J.B. Campbell of the 'National Educator'. If the bombs had been placed
properly, it could have toppled one tower into the other and brought them
both down along with the 50,000 people inside. The New York Times now reports
that the FBI could have thwarted the bombing by simply calling it off,
or by building the bomb with harmless powder. One of the FBI conspirators,
a former Egyptian army officer, secretly taped his meetings with his FBI
handlers. Emad Ali Salem recalls in the tape recorded meeting that the
FBI had planned on building the bomb with a phoney powder and grabbing
the people who had been trapped in the plot. But the informer, who is heard
lecturing his FBI handlers, said the powder scheme was called off and &quot;we
didn't do that.&quot; We remember the FBI crowing about its investigative
prowess after its remarkably swift nabbing of the suspects, based on debris
found in the bomb's crater. This was never true, for later we were to learn
that the FBI's informant, Emad Ali Salem, had to teach the suspects HOW
TO MAKE A PROPER BOMB. Not only did the FBI know the suspects all along,
but it GAVE THEM A BOMB. The FBI could have ordered Salem to make a harmless
bomb but, for some reason, it decided to provide a real bomb which had
the power to kill 50,000 people and to let the suspects go ahead and explode
it. My conclusion is that Cooper's prediction was 100% right on the mark.
It gets worse...The San Francisco Chronicle reported on September 25, 1993
that observers from 11 counties watched as the U.S. Department of Energy
performed what it called the largest detonation of non-nuclear explosives
ever conducted. The blast beneath the Nevada desert resulted from the ignition
of ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel, which produced a force equivalent
to a one-kiloton nuclear bomb. The test was designed to allow scientists
to distinguish between nuclear and non-nuclear blasts should a permanent
worldwide ban on nuclear testing be established. Gee, all these years and
they still don't know the difference. Rumors began circulating in January
of this year that meetings were being held among federal law enforcement
agencies for the purpose of planing a move against the militia in April.
Most ignored these rumors. On February 18th Cooper spoke at a Constitution
Party rally in Ferndale, Michigan. A federal agent in the audience held
his badge and identification up to the crowd stating clearly that the federal
government had held meetings among several agencies for the purpose of
making an all out assault against patriots and the militias in April. His
statement was video taped and in on record. Cooper verified his credentials.
Such an attack would be political suicide unless some great tragedy turned
the public against the militias. It was shortly after Michigan that Cooper
obtained a copy of the 'Omnibus Counter Terrorism Act of 1995' introduced
on February 10th by Joe Biden in the Senate (S-390) and Charles Shumer
in the House (HR-896). Cooper remembers the random shooting that always
occurred before anti-gun legislation came up for a vote. He predicted a
wave of terrorism directed against the United States would begin in the
near future. He had already made this prediction in his book 'Behold a
Pale Horse' and during many lectures. It is all recorded. He knew this
would happen if all other attempts to destroy patriotism and disarm the
American people failed. He stated this in the book that all patriots would
be labeled as terrorists. A warning was contained in a memo issued by the
U.S. Marshals Service on May 15th. The memo expressed fear that &quot;the
terrorist attacks would be designed to attract worldwide press attention
to an Islamic Religious vendetta through the mass murder of innocent victims.&quot;
The warning stated that Middle Eastern terrorists were planning to launch
suicide attacks against federal facilities nationwide. Authorities reviewed
the security at Oklahoma city's Alfred P. Murrah building, nothing was
changed, and one guard was left to patrol a four building complex. Representative
James Saxton (R), a senior member of the House Task force on Terrorism,
said his group had alerted law enforcement and intelligence personnel on
February 27th that there was an increased threat of terrorism. Another
rumor flew through the grapevine. This one alleged that the federal government
would make an all out attack upon patriots and the militias on March 24th
and 25th. The rumor came from many sources and was published in 'Strategic
Investment' lending credibility to the story. ***************************
Strategic investment/March 22, 1995, behind the lines, by Jack Wheeler
- The slaughter of dozens of women and children in Waco by government stormtroopers
under the command of Field Marshall Reno may pale in comparison to what
has been planned for late March: a nationwide BATF/FBI assault on private
militias as the prelude to a possible declaration of martial law throughout
the United States. All leaves and vacations have been canceled for BATF/FBI
personnel, and for various State Police and national Guard's such as California's.
The Amry's infamous Joint Task Force Six (which did the training for Waco)
has been training BATF jackbooters with Bradley Assault Vehicles at Ft.
Bliss, Texas. Government agent provocateurs are set to plant fully automatic
and heavy weapons like rocket launchers, on the property of militia leaders.
Every militia in the country - and there are dozens, many of which are
well-armed and well-led by former or even active duty officers - is on
a state of Red Alert. Should Reno be stupid enough to actually attack them
militarily, there is going to be a lot of blood. The establishment media
is programmed to immediately thereafter thunderously bellow for nationwide
gun confiscation and even martial law. The Senate Armed Forces Committee
has been alerted and it questioning key Defense and Justice people behind
closed doors. Hopefully, Reno's Waco 2 can be stopped in time. But that
it was plotted in the first place should be a sobering lesson as to what
a horrifying extent liberalism, the political philosophy of the administration
and the Democratic Party, has been converted into a close relative of fascism.</P>

<P>Three Congressmen believed these stories to be true and wrote letters
to Janet Reno asking for an explanation. They cited federal law enforcement
sources. No answer was forthcoming. Nothing could happen unless something
were to occur that would turn the public against the militia. William Cooper
put out feelers through his people across the nation and the answer came
back the same. He could not identify any patriot or militia organization
that would do anything of the nature that would be required to justify
an all out assault upon patriots and the militia. He knew only that the
March dates were bogus. April approached. He had no hard evidence that
anything would occur, only reports from many credible sources, and fearing
that this could be an attempt to discredit the Intelligence Service, the
'Hour of the Time' and 'Veritas', he maintained silence. Ordo Ab Chao....
On Monday, April 17th the Orange County Register reported that the FBI
will open an international police training academy in Budapest. In an incredible
admission of the Socialist agenda Clinton announced that American law-enforcement
agencies are rapidly expanding over seas, deploying agents to dozens of
countries in scores of joint investigations. This followed on the heels
of the recent announcement that the FBI had opened an office in Moscow
and what used to be the KBG had opened an office in the United States.
These facts herald the formation of a nucleus for a world police/investigative
body. David Johnson of the New York Times reported, &quot;Last year, Freeh
opened an FBI office in Moscow, one of an overseas network of 24 such offices,
forward command posts for an increasingly global detective agency. He has
also been a driving force behind the Budapest training academy. Our worst
fears became reality on Wednesday morning, April 19, 1995. A bomb had gone
off at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. It became obvious within
hours that what had happened and what was being reported by the media were
two, completely different, events. The event reported be the news networks
must have taken place in China because it sure didn't happen here. The
truth is:</P>

<P>1. Witnesses reported hearing two distinct explosions, seconds apart,
then the ominous rumbling of the building falling in itself.</P>

<P>2. Survivors, who were in the building near the front wall reported
being hurled out of the front of the federal building through cinder block
walls into the street.</P>

<P>3. The front of the federal building was thrown out, away from the federal
building, and into the building across the street.</P>

<P>4. The front of the federal building was blown into the street immediately
in front and slightly to the left of center when facing what had been the
front of the federal building.</P>

<P>5. The first video tape of the disaster shows two large columns of black
smoke, one rising from the crater area in the street, and the other rising
from the center of the federal building.</P>

<P>6. Undetonated plastic explosives were found on the scene by the first
rescue workers. A rocket launcher was also found. This was reported then
later denied. Witnesses stick to their original story.</P>

<P>7. Officials reported that a second bomb had been found and police began
an immediate evacuation of the entire downtown area. Radio buffs and Intelligence
service agents monitoring scanners confirmed that radio traffic indicated
that a second bomb had been found. Explosives experts were called in along
with a bomb disposal truck. This was seen on television and those monitoring
scanners confirmed the disarming of the bomb was in progress. The following
was intercepted by 3 different people. I did not hear it and I have not
been able to obtain a copy of the tape. the speakers are unknown. Except
for minor differences all three people reported exactly the same conversation.
First voice - &quot;Boy, you're not going to believe this!&quot; Second
voice - &quot;Believe what?&quot; First voice - &quot;I can't believe it
... this is a military bomb!&quot; After several hours the bomb disposal
truck left and the report of a second bomb was denied.</P>

<P>8. Two people identifying themselves as firemen, but refusing to give
their names, reported that the second bomb was in fact several bombs, olive
drab colored cans of fulminate of mercury, clearly labeled as such, with
MilSpec numbers, which were found intact on separate floors next to the
elevator shaft. Officials denied these allegations. The following day an
elderly gentleman who identified himself as the father of one of the firemen
called to confirm that his son had reported the same findings to him. He
refused to give his name.</P>

<P>9. Initial examination of the bomb scene revealed that a minimum of
two bombs were needed to inflict the damage that presented. The steel reinforced
concrete pillars that held up the building were sheered off at ground level
clear back to the third pillar throughout the building. Explosives experts
have confirmed that this is impossible with the one bomb scenario being
presented by the government and the media. The reports of the survivors
who were blown out of the front of the building into the street and the
front of the building blown outward across the street support their findings.
A retired General who had spent over 25 years in explosives research and
ultimately commanded the explosives research facility for a branch of the
military informed us that the pillars could only be taken down at ground
level by satchel charges or shaped charges placed upon each pillar. His
mathematics are impressive. I do not have the expertise to understand what
he is talking about, but with his credentials someone had better listen.</P>

<P>After the brief and painful accusations against the Islamic community
and the arrest of several people of mid-eastern descent, including one
traveler at London's Heathrow Airport, the accusations swung right around
as Cooper predicted to patriots and militias. The most incredible hate
campaign in the history of the world was directed toward Islamics, Christians,
whites, males, patriots, militias, anyone using diesel fuel, anyone using
fertilizer, anyone from the state of Michigan, all who support the constitution
for the United States of America, and the people who live in Arizona, especially
talk radio hosts. The standard Ryder truck rental reared its ugly head
and within hours the FBI not only had enough parts to identify the type
of truck but had already traced it back to the rental agency. (Incredible)
The FBI quickly produced what appeared to be drawings of near photograph
quality of two suspects. Later, after McVeigh was captured, the FBI released
a new drawing of John Doe #2 which looked more like a drawing. The man
who is accused of bombing the federal building was caught speeding in a
car, his own, without license plates. He was arrested, without resistance,
for carrying a concealed weapon and jailed. (How convenient) A CBS feed
on the KU satellite band reported that the Initial report that the concealed
weapon was a gun was in error. The commentator (a woman) reported that
the concealed weapon for which McVeigh was jailed was a knife. This report
was never aired to our knowledge. The FBI and the media reported that McVeigh
lived in Kingman, Arizona at Canyon West Trailer Park. He was described
as having lived in trailer #19, under the name of his girlfriend. They
reported that he was evicted after a stormy nine months in which the man
played loud music, left piles of beer cans and a wrecked car by the trailer
and belligerently refused to obey camp rules. When interested people actually
contacted these same people they stated that McVeigh had lived in trailer
#11 from June 1993 until early September 1993. They described Tim McVeigh
as a nice man, quiet and neat. &quot;He was a nice guy, a model tenant.&quot;
The pawn shop owner, William Stumpp, killed in Texarkana by Richard Wayne
Snell was not a Jew and the press knew this all the time they reported
that he was a Jew. Stumpp was an Episcopalian not Jewish. Alacia Adams
Esquivios has signed an affidavit stating that she saw John Doe #2 on April
19th in a white government van traveling south on highway 44 at 5:15 pm.
She called the FBI on the morning of the 21st and reported what she saw.
She was told an agent would contact her for an interview. No one showed.
She called again on Monday the 24th. The person who answered the phone
said an agent would come out and interview her. She is still waiting. Members
of the St. Lucie-based second regiment of the Florida State Militia report
that Timothy McVeigh attended a local militia rally last year as a bodyguard
for Mark Koernke. Koernke denies any knowledge of McVeigh. The seismograph
report from Oklahoma University, according to Dr. Luza of the University
of Oklahoma-Norman, shows two unmistakable &quot;events&quot; that happened
in the Oklahoma City area, the first at 9:02 am followed by a second 10
seconds later. Both are surface events similar in signature to a quarry
blast, both of approximately the same duration and magnitude. no other
disturbance occurred the morning of the 19th of April in the Oklahoma City
area. The seismograph confirms witness reports of two explosions. In an
interview Dr. Luza said the second event could not have been an echo or
bounce back because the seismograph would have shown a distinctly separate
pattern if it had been either of those two things, and geologists are easily
able to recognize the secondary pattern when such an echo or bounceback
occurs. When asked if the second event could have been caused by the crashing
of the building as it collapsed, Dr. Luza said no, and explained that had
the seismograph recorded the collapse of the building, the second markings
would have been of a much lesser magnitude, and it did not take the building
ten seconds after the explosion to begin to collapse. In his closing remarks,
Dr. Luza stated that the two events were of identical magnitude, as if
the same bomb had gone off twice, and that if the second event had been
caused by an echo or anything else, the seismographic record would not
have shown such perfect consistency between the two events. His conclusion
was that there were definitely two separate explosions in the Oklahoma
city area separated by only 10 seconds. The official interpretation of
the seismograph record from the Oklahoma Geological Survey Seismograph
Station in Norman, Oklahoma is that they recorded a large surface-wave
&quot;train&quot; at 9:02:13 a.m. (140213 UTC) shortly after the explosion
at the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The seismometer
is located approximately four miles north of Norman and sixteen miles from
downtown Oklahoma City. A second large surface-wave was recorded at 9:02:23
a.m. (140223 UTC). The location and source of the second surface-wave recording
is unknown. The record is read from top to bottom and from left to right.
The small vertical offsets of the horizontal lines are minute marks. Hour
marks are twice as long as the minute marks. I've seen a second seismographic
reading from the Oklahoma City Omniplex. The station is very close to the
federal building and the seismograph reflects the fact. The two explosions
are registered on this graph as blank spaces where the needle literally
jumped off the sheet. The events are separated by 10 seconds of ink. No
experts exist at the Omniplex station. The employee who gave me a copy
said it was miraculous that the Omniplex had any records at all because
the seismograph had not been working up until 40 minutes prior to the explosions.
The Omniplex is located at the Kirkpatrick Center, at 50th and Martin Luther
King Blvd. The FBI seized the original seismographic record. My copy is
a copy made before the seizure by an employee One of the federal agents
who died in the blast was the former head of President Clinton's Secret
Service team of bodyguards. How many does that make? Oklahoma Governor
Frank Keating is an ex-FBI agent. Anti-terrorism bill is now on the fast
track. In a &quot;Bullet Poll&quot; conducted by KTBS-TV Channel 3, Shreveport,
Louisiana and reported on April 20th the following question was asked ...
&quot;Would you be willing to give up some of your freedom for a little
security?&quot; 74% reportedly fell into the category bracketed by &quot;some-most-all&quot;.
On April 28th the tape of James Nichols hearing was released by court order
and it was blank. Nothing whatsoever could be heard on the tape. It was
the only record of the proceedings. Office workers state that almost all
of the FBI and BATF agents and an unbelievable number of supervisory personnel
did not arrive at work at their usual time on Wednesday, April 19, 1995
and were not in the building when the bomb went off. A card was sent to
the hospital for the survivors by a third grade boy. It reads: &quot;Hello,
I hope you feel better from the explosion in Oklahoma. I wish it never
had happened. I felt bad for the people who died and the people who got
hurt. That's only the beginning of what's going to happen to America. Hope
you feel better, Jonathan Roden&quot;</P>

<P>Dope, Incorporated</P>

<P>Extracted from Dope, Inc.-The Book That Drove Henry Kissinger Crazy</P>

<P>supplied by The P/\NTHER</P>

<P>Seventeen years ago, the first edition of Dope, Inc. was released. Commissioned
by anti-drug American statesman Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr, it was the first
book to reveal that the illegal drug cartel was becoming the world's biggest
business; to name the causes of the war 'Dope, Inc.' has waged against
every nation in the world; and to reveal the names of the 'untouchable'
figures who protect it, including the European monarchs, whom our Hollywood
media have sold to the public as veritable deities.</P>

<P>Even before the first copies of the first edition of Dope, Inc.-Britain's
Opium War Against the United States, rolled off the press in December 1978,
leaders of the narcotics enterprise were busy trying to stop LaRouche.
Beginning in summer 1978, the Anti Defamation League (ADL) launched a multimillion-dollar
campaign to label LaRouche and his political associates as &quot;anti-Semites&quot;
for daring to expose the involvement of gangsters like Merey Lansky and
Zionist lobby leaders like Edgar Bronfman and Max Fisher in the dope business.
LaRouche also identified the powerful British Crown bankers as partners
in the dope trade, along with the Jewish crime syndicate.</P>

<P>The ADL's 'anti-Semitic' smear against LaRouche was pure 'big lie' terrorism
in the tradition of Nazi propagandist Joesph Goebbels. Everyone who bothered
to look into the matter knew that LaRouche's political career had been
built around his discoveries in physical economy, and that by 1978 he had
written hundreds of articles and several books exposing the fascist economic
austerity policies behind the Nazi holocaust which killed millions of Jews
and other victims. The ADL's bizarre slanders prompted EIR's investigators
to scrutinize the history of the supposed 'Jewish civil rights' organization.</P>

<P>The probe turned up a 70-year legacy of intimate ADL ties with Jewish
gangsters, from Meyer Lansky and his 'Our Crowd' sponsor Arnold Rothstein,
to more contemporary Dope, Inc. figures such as Max Fisher, Edgar Bronfman,
Edmond Safra, Meshulam Riklis, the ADL's own national chairman, Kenneth
Bialkin, and the lawyer for the Medellin Cartel's 'American connection',
Robert Vesco. We also discovered that much of the ADL's financial backing
comes from leading families of the Anglo-American establishment, whose
fortunes trace back to the British banks and trading companies that ran
the opium clipper ships in and out of China in the last century.</P>

<P>To this day, the ADL holds the key to the corruption of the American
political and judicial system, a corruption that was bought and paid for
by the proceeds of the international dope trade. Lyndon LaRouche was railroaded
to prison on a train built by drug money and stoked by government officials
and private agencies on the pad of Dope, Inc.</P>

<P>By the summer of 1982, the ADL was joined in its 'Get LaRouche' efforts
by Henry A. Kissinger, former Secretary of State and recipient of the ADL's
Man of the Year award. Kissinger launched a vendetta to get the federal
government to shut down the LaRouche movement.</P>

<P>The case of LaRouche associate, Lewis du Pont Smitch, illustrates the
desperation of the efforts by Kissinger and the 'Get LaRouche' task force
to stop the LaRouche movement's organizing of a national war on drugs.
An heir to the du Pont family industrial fortune, Smitch contributed US$212,000
to the LaRouche movement in 1985, the bulk of it for the publication of
the second edition of this book. Within months, Smith's parents-advised
by none other than Kissinger-had secured a judgment in the Chester Country,
Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, depriving their son of control of his
inheritance and suspending his basic human rights-such as the right to
sign contracts and be married-on the grounds that Smith was &quot;mentally
incompetent&quot;. Smith's is the first case in American history in which
an individual has been declared incompetent by the courts on the basis
of political affiliation.</P>

<P>Kissinger: A British Agent of Influence</P>

<P>Although Kissinger has been historically a close ally of the most rabid
factions inside Israel and within the Zionist establishment in the United
States, his primary allegiance throughout his political career has been
to the British Crown and its intelligence and financial tentacles.</P>

<P>On 10 May 1982, addressing a celebration at the Royal Institute for
International Affairs at Chatham House in London, Kissinger boasted that
throughout his career in the Nixon and Ford administrations, he had always
been closer to the British Foreign Office than to his American colleagues,
and had taken all his major policy leads from London. Kissinger set up
the international 'consulting firm' Kissinger Associates, in partnership
with Britain's Peter Lord Carrington, shortly after he delivered that Chatham
House lecture.</P>

<P>Chatham House is a successor to the old British East India Company,
and serves as the think-tank and foreign intelligence arm of the British
Crown. The roots of Chatham House are to be found in Britain's nineteenth-century
Opium War policy.</P>

<P>Kissinger is no stranger to the world of international dope trafficking.
The 1978 edition of Dope, Inc. told how Kissinger played a pivotal role
in covering up the involvement of the People's Republic of China in the
South East Asian Golden Triangle heroin trade in the early 1970s when he
was shuttling between Washington and Beijing playing the 'China card'.
Tens of thousands of American GIs who became addicted to drugs in South
East Asia during the Vietnam War should hold Kissinger at least partially
responsible for their habits. Later, during the 1980s, through Kissinger
Associates, Henry became a business partner of some of the same Chinese
opium lords he protected from American drug enforcement for over a decade.</P>

<P>Kissinger was furious that LaRouche and his associates widely circulated
the official text of his Chatham House speech to document that Kissinger
was a loyal asset of the British Crown. He went head-to-head with LaRouche
over Reagan administration policy. By 1982, a major battle had broken out
within the administration over the emerging Ibero-American debt crisis,
a crisis of which LaRouche had been warning senior White House officials
for months. A confrontation evolved between LaRouch and Kissinger over
whether Washington would negotiate an equitable solution to the debt crisis,
on a government-to-government basis, or back International Monetary Fund
policies aimed at further looting our hemispheric neighbors.</P>

<P>Kissinger's own efforts, aided by the ADL's so-called Civil Rights Division,
were augmented in January 1983 by a Kissinger solicited intervention on
the part of several members of President Ronald Reagan's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board, led by Edward Bettett Williams, David Abshire and Leo Cherne.
The PFIAB members demanded that the FBI launch an international investigation
of Lyndon LaRouche, in effect claiming that LaRouche's expose of Kissinger's
record of selling out the United States to British, Soviet and Dope, Inc.
interests was somehow &quot;subversive&quot;.</P>

<P>Government documents catalog the role of Kissinger's PFIAB cronies.
A memorandum from Webster to his chief deputy, Oliver Revell, dated 12
January 1983, stated in part: &quot;At the PFIAB meeting today, [name reacted]
raised the subject of the activities of the US Labor Party and Lyndon LaRouche.
He noted that he and a number of other Americans in public life had been
the subject of repeated harassment by LaRouche and wondered whether the
FBI had a basis for investigating these activities under the guidelines
or otherwise. A number of members present, including Edward Bennett Williams,
raised the question of the sources for these US Labor Party activities.
In view of the large amounts obviously being expended worldwide, the question
was raised whether the US Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence
agencies.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</P>

<P>The PFIAB inquiry led in early 1983 to the opening of a formal FBI investigation
into Lyndon LaRouche and his associates. That inquiry provided the legal
cover for an all-out offensive to drive LaRouche and his associates out
of business and into prison. The &quot;guidelines&quot; under which the
unconstitutional 'Get LaRouche' campaign was conducted, were contained
in a little-known White House document, Executive Order 12333, signed by
President Reagan in December 1981. EO 12333 gave the FBI and US intelligence
agencies a broad mandate to spy on and conduct covert actions against American
citizens deemed to be opponents of the incumbent administration. EO 12333
also allowed these agencies to use private citizens as their agents in
carrying out these operations. At this point, the ADL became an integral
component of the government's 'Get LaRouche' task force.</P>

<P>The ADL and Kissinger found their most willing collaborators inside
the Reagan-Bush administration among the spooks and White House staffers
involved in the illegal, secret Iran-Contra program. Once again, the pawprints
of Dope, Inc. were everywhere.</P>

<P>LaRouche Objects to Contra Policy</P>

<P>In the first years of the Reagan administration, LaRouche had collaborated
with several senior administration officials in the development of the
Strategic Defense Initiative and other national security policies. During
the 1982-83 period, LaRouche and his colleagues had been quietly approached
and asked to also cooperate with the administration's effort to support
the Contra guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
LaRouche warned the Reagan administration that the Contras were a wholly
owned asset of international gun and drug trafficking organizations and
that the entire anti-Sandinista program-and the Reagan administration's
widely publicized anti-drug efforts along with it-were doomed to disaster
if the administration went ahead with its Contra support program. As an
alternative plan of action, LaRouche proposed that the administration focus
its Central American efforts on an all out war on drugs which would, among
other things, expose Soviet, Cuban and Sandinista involvement in the dope
trade.</P>

<P>By this time, with pressure from Wall Street and the Zionist lobby,
Henry Kissinger had been named to head up the Reagan administration's Blue
Ribbon Commission on Central American Policy. A one-time paid employee
of the ADL, Carl Gershman, had been named as the chief of the administration's
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a covert operations funding agency
housed in the State Department's US Information Agency. The NED was at
the center of the secret support for the Contras. For Kissinger and the
ADL-led NED, dealing with cocaine traffickers was no problem. But LaRouche's
public expose of leading drug traffickers on the government payroll was
a problem.</P>

<P>A May 1986 memo from White House Iran-Contra operator Gen. Richard Secord
to National Security Council staffer Oliver North confirms that the Contra
support apparatus-what Sen. David Boren (D-Oklahoma) labelled the &quot;secret,
parallel government&quot;-was gathering &quot;information against LaRouche&quot;.</P>

<P>By the spring of 1986, following dramatic electoral victories in the
statewide Illinois Democratic Party primary by two LaRouche backed candidates
for lieutenant governor and secretary of state, the &quot;Get LaRouche&quot;
forces inside the government had built up momentum, especially inside the
deeply corrupted Department of Justice and the FBI.</P>

<P>Two of the most zealous of the Justice Department 'Get LaRouche' activists
were William Weld and Arnold Burns. Weld was the US attorney in Boston
who led the federal government's pioneering strike-force against LaRouche.
He became head of the Department of Justice Criminal Division in September
1986, the number-two position at the DOJ. Now Governor of Massachusetts,
Weld is the scion of a prominent blue-blood family that made its fortune
in the China opium trade.</P>

<P>Arnold Burns, the Deputy Attorney General, was a director of the ADL's
Sterling National Bank, an outfit founded by mob cronies of Meyer Lansky
and implicated in hot-money dealings in the United States, Italy and Israel.
Burns himself was nearly indicted in a money-laundering scheme run by Israel's
secret service, the Mossad. It would later emerge that Burns' partners
in that scheme were part of the Jonathan Jay Pollard Israeli-Soviet espionage
ring.</P>

<P>In October 1986, an army of over 400 federal and state police, accompanied
by helicopters, fixed-wing planes and an armored personnel carrier, conducted
a raid against the offices of several LaRouche-associated publications
in Leesburg, Virginia. This was the largest domestic paramilitary action
by the federal government since the urban and student riots of the late
1960s and early 1970s. The purpose was simply to execute two search warrants
and make four arrests of people who had no criminal records!</P>

<P>Over the next several years, LaRouche and dozens of associates were
arrested and put on trial. A prosecution of LaRouche and a dozen co-defendants
in a Boston federal court ended in a mistrial on 4 May 1988. The Boston
jury had heard 92 days of testimony from government witnesses. The defense
never got to present its case. However, the jurors, according to press
accounts, were so angry at the government's behavior that when they polled
themselves after they had been dismissed by the judge, they voted LaRouche
and the others &quot;not guilty&quot; on all 125 counts. One juror told
the Boston Herald on 5 May 1988 that he and his colleagues were convinced
the government had committed crimes against LaRouche. LaRouche told the
press that he had been defrauded of a verdict of &quot;innocent&quot;.</P>

<P>Six months later, the Justice Department re-indicted LaRouche in an
Alexandria, Virginia federal district court on nearly identical charges.
The judge and they jury were rigged. The jury foreman, a Department of
Agriculture official named Buster HOrton, had been a member of a secret
government task force that also included Oliver North. The judge, Albert
V. Bryan, Jr. had been a business partner of the CIA's biggest secret arms
dealer, Sam Cummings. In that federal trial and at subsequent state trials
in Virginia, leading officials of the ADL operated as de facto members
of the government's prosecution team. In one telling incident, the ADL
was caught attempting to bribe a Commonwealth of Virginia trial judge with
a promise of a state Supreme Court post in return for throwing the book
at the LaRouche defendants.</P>

<P>On 27 January 1989, just days after George Bush was inaugurated as President,
LaRouche was deprived of bail, pending appeal, and thrown in federal prison,
along with six colleagues. LaRouche was sentenced to 15 years in prison-a
life sentence for a man already in his mid-60's. Bush added his imprimatur
to the jailing by refusing to release thousands of pages of exculpatory
evidence under the control of the White House. Of all his political adversaries
and critics, Lyndon LaRouche was the one man whom George Bush desperately
wanted out of the way.</P>

<P>But the jailing of LaRouche and some of his closest colleagues was not
enough to satisfy the Dope, Inc. crowd. Two LaRouche-linked publications,
New Solidarity, a twice-weekly newspaper with over 100,000 subscribers,
and Fusion a science magazine with over 114,000 subscribers were seized
by the government on 21 April 1987 and shut down in an action that federal
courts after the fact declared to have been illegal. Federal Bankruptcy
Court Judge Martin V. B. Bostetter wrote in his 25 October 1989 decision,
which was upheld on appeal, that the government action had been in &quot;bad
faith&quot; and that the government had committed a &quot;constructive
fraud upon the court&quot;.</P>

<P>When Lyndon LaRouche first warned senior Reagan administration officials
about the drug cartel links of the Nicaraguan Contras, it was not yet publicly
known that the US government was selling dope to American children to fund
the secret Contra war in Nicaragua (even at the same time that some well-meaning
government officials thought they were genuinely fighting drugs).</P>

<P>Within days of the Leesburg raid, the first details of the Iran Contra
scandal surfaced following the crash of an American supply plane over Nicaraguan
territory and the arrest of Eugene Hasenfus, a member of the crew. In the
months following the Hasenfus capture, more and more pieces of the secret
government corruption came out.</P>

<P>The case of Lt. Col. Oliver North is one good example of this corruption,
especially because so much media attention has been directed toward building
up the image of the Marine-turned-White House superspy as a model of American
patriotism.</P>

<P>Evidence made public during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings,
through federal and state court cases and international criminal prosecutions,
reveals that Oliver North was in the middle of a major international arms-for-drugs
trafficking operations which was run out of his National Security Council
office at the Old Executive Office building next door to the White House.</P>

<P>Colonel North was the day-to-day operations officer for the Contra resupply
program. But it was Vice-President George Bush, the former CIA Director,
who was formally in charge of the entire Reagan administration Central
America covert operations program. Under National Security Decision Directive
3, signed by Ronald Reagan in May 1982, Bush was placed in charge of two
little-known White House secret committees: the Special Situation Group
(SSG) and the Crisis Pre-Planning Group (CPPG). Oliver NOrth was the secretary
of the CPPG, and it was in this capacity that he ran the Central America
spook show under George Bush.</P>

<P>North's personal notebooks, which cataloged most of his meetings, telephone
calls and personal observations during his White House days, betray the
fact that he was well aware that the Contras were being heavily financed
by Miami-based cocaine traffickers. For example, a 26 March 1985 handwritten
entry in North's notebook read: &quot;Rafael Quintero-Secord's Agent should
be on shore when arrivals occur-as liaison w/ APLICANO...Quintero...&quot;
Several days later, on 3 April, a sequel note reads: &quot;0600-RAFAEL
QUINTERO-(captured)-known narcotics trafficker-Enrique Camarena..&quot;.</P>

<P>Camarena was a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in Guadalajara,
Mexico, who was kidnapped and tortured to death in February 1985. In 1990,
Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a Honduran national who helped set up Colombian
cocaine routes through Mexico, was convicted along with several other men
in federal court in Los Angeles of conspiracy to kidnap and murder Camarena.</P>

<P>BEYOND THE MOON surpressed NASA findings by Fred Steckling supplied
by The P/\NTHER/UMF </P>

<P>This article does not deal with the Moon directly, but ventures farther
out into our solar system. Today, despite our Mariner and Viking missions
to Venus and Mars, the mystery about our neighbor planets has only widened
and most questions still remain unexplained. The most pressing question
of all is, does life exist on these worlds? Many scientists have voiced
their opinion that unless we send manned spacecraft concerning life on
these worlds may never satisfactorily be explained. The late Werner Von
Braun, rocket specialist for NASA, once stated that manned space flights
are by far more efficient than the remote controlled devices. Man, after
all, is performing his tasks in space more efficiently than any computer
ever could. &quot;Besides&quot;, Braun remarked, &quot;Man can be mass
produced by unskilled labor.&quot;</P>

<P>The mysteries mount because already from the early analysis of the United
States Mariner and the Soviet Venera missions to Venus, many contradictory
findings were reported. Since these mysteries cannot be explored by telescopes
as the planets are too far away, we must rely totally on data radioed back
to Earth by the satellites. Over the centuries our Moon, for instance,
has been the target for endless hours of telescopic observations. These
observations have revealed to us that at least some unexplainable things
are happening up there. The problem is, however, that even now after our
Apollo landings, these mysteries still remain. This indicates that we know
what is going on, to some extent, but hesitate to talk about it.</P>

<P>Receiving correct information from our space probes on Venus and Mars
makes it easier to conceal information, if we wish to do so. Therefore,
it is for the officials to determine whether to release this truth, or
untruth, over which they retain complete control. If we would live in a
truthful world, it would be easy to accept all that we are told. But most
of us know better. Suspecting the very real possibility of &quot;the great
cosmic cover-up&quot; as some authors have termed it, the public needs
to maintain a constant vigil on the officials and the validity of their
releases. Much &quot;between the lines&quot; reading is required as well
as an unrelenting search for contradictory statements to the press and
public, in order to seize the 'wool' before it is pulled too far over the
eyes of the public.</P>

<P>We live in a privileged country and our constitutional rights permit
us to question the officials, as well as our leaders. In our country where
the government is of the people, by the people, and for the people, this
relationship must be maintained under all circumstances, in order that
our freedom may be preserved.</P>

<P>Freedom alone, contrary to the belief of many, is not just the right
for anyone to do as he pleases, but it also entails the duty to seek and
maintain the truth about things of a political, economic, and religious
nature. No doubt the technical feat of steering a remote-controlled spacecraft
to the endless voids of space and locating its target with such accuracy
is a great engineering undertaking. Intricate mathematical and ballistic
problems must be solved in order to succeed in these missions. We know
they arrived there, but is the data they send back bonafide?</P>

<P>The signals received here on Earth by our tracking stations were send
in a code, deciphered only by the very top scientists through sophisticated
decoding equipment. The point I am trying to make is simple. While these
beeps, dots, and dashes are witnessed by literally hundreds of scientists,
how many of them really know what this jargon means before it is decoded?
It is obvious that only a few do and we have to trust them. I recall discrepancies
which arose when the United States Mariner spacecraft and the Soviet Venera
spacecraft radioed back to Earth temperature differences from Venus, ranging
up to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Naturally both nations claimed technical
superiority, insisting that their instruments were of superior design.
Because of this conflict, secret meetings in Europe by the space experts
from the United States and the USSR were held in order to coordinate their
releases, as such confusion causes the public to become dissatisfied, wondering,
skeptical and restless.</P>

<P>The soft landing devices on Venus caused much more controversy than
anticipated. We were told that Venus is the Earth's sister planet, very
much the same size as Earth, but that its atmospheric density is over one
hundred times as dense as that of Earth, and is laden with sulfuric acid.
People would have accepted that. However, when the officials stated that
these spacecraft landed on Venus by parachute, that stretched the imagination.
The explanation is simple. It is impossible to parachute an object of this
size, weight, and density to the surface of Venus through an atmosphere
one hundred times as dense as Earth. That is like attempting to parachute
this same device 2,000 feet down to the bottom of our sea, with pressures
identical to those of the Venusian atmosphere. Even scientists at NASA
confirmed this fact, indirectly, not with the planet Venus, but with Titan,
Saturn's moon. The NASA press release of December 12, 1980, stated that
Titan had a 300-mile thick atmosphere, hence its surface cannot be seen.
The conditions there seem to be identical to those on Venus. If future
spacecraft entitled the Cronos probe were to be send to Titan to land by
parachute, NASA space expert, James Murphy, indicated the parachute would
not work, because the atmosphere of Titan is too dense.</P>

<P>If the atmosphere of Venus is really over one hundred times as dense
as ours, a landing device would float to its surface by itself, like a
pearl down into the bottom of a shampoo bottle. This would make a parachute
landing unnecessary. Furthermore, a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit
produces violent thermals. I doubt seriously that even if the Venusian
atmosphere were identical to ours that it would be a simple matter to land
a parachute there, because of thermal activity.</P>

<P>When the USSR landed one of its Venera spacecraft on the surface of
Venus, it transmitted some excellent photographs, depicting a bright landscape
of hills and rocks, much like our deserts on Earth. This caused even greater
surprise, because an atmosphere that dense should produce total darkness
on the surface of Venus. how they managed to photograph this well lit landscape,
emitting an abundance of sunlight, has been a continuing mystery.</P>

<P>This posed other questions, such as the reports of mapping the surface
of Venus by radar. If this would be possible, then we should be able to
map our own ocean floors by radar. However, this is not possible because
on earth the water reflects the radar beams and so do water vapor clouds,
which have also been detected on Venus. One would assume that with the
density and consistency of water, we should instead attempt to use sonar
to map the surface of Venus. From the charts recently released, the radar
techniques seems to work well, which raises doubts that the Venusian atmosphere
is really as dense as we are being told.</P>

<P>Just recently released findings by the USSR, which is exhibiting much
interest in Venus, revealed the discovery of electromagnetic discharges
in the form of lighting flashes on that planet. Their spacecraft, Venera
11, also recorded a forceful storm ninety miles wide, with lighting discharges
at the rate of twenty-five per second. United States scientists said that
this was rather remarkable, because nobody expected to find lightning on
Venus. Naturally, they are surprised because an atmosphere over one hundred
times as dense as ours, laden with sulfuric acid, would be self-grounding,
making lighting highly improbable. Does this mean now that we are fed untrue
information deliberately? Or does this mean that the officials are trying
to tell us something, very much like they did with the Moon? Not outright
revelations, but here and there, a bit of contradiction to make us think.</P>

<P>There are more surprises to be found on Venus, and one of them is its
cloud formations, which totally envelop the planet. Rotation of Venus was
determined by radar, as well as by other means, to be every 280 days, once
around its axis. Let us hope that this was correctly performed. Photographs
of the Venusian cloud patterns, and the behavior of their weather, at least
in the upper atmosphere, is quite familiar to us, because it looks very
much like our own. The cloud patterns move away from the equator area toward
the northern and southern hemisphere in clockwise and counterclockwise
fashion, and it takes them about four days to go around the planet once.
One begins to wonder why these clouds behave just like those on Earth,
which also take about the same time to move around the Earth. In other
words, what makes the clouds move?</P>

<P>The contradictions continue, one being the importance of having all
United States landing spacecraft on Venus thoroughly sterilized. This brings
up the question of the necessity of sterilization in an 800 degree fahrenheit
atmosphere, which is four times as hot as boiling water. It is true that
certain bacteria can survive, and even reproduce under many hostile conditions,
like the cooling water surrounding nuclear reactors, in tanks of jet aircraft,
or in jars of gasoline, as one scientist in Los Angeles demonstrated to
me.. Even below, deep in our oceans around hot volcanic geysers, certain
strains of bacteria survive, as well as algae. I am certain that common
bacteria, such as we are exposed to on the surface of the Earth daily,
would not enjoy longevity on Venus, should it be as hot there as we have
been informed.</P>

<P>Speaking of contamination of other planets, it has been found that micro-organisms
have been traced, even to the far reaches of space, which probably were
deposited there by the trail of Earth's atmosphere, or perhaps even other
planets. Since these organisms seem to survive in hibernation almost indefinitely,
they may in time become part of another atmosphere in another planet, attracted
by its gravity, and gently flow toward its surface and multiply. If this
is true, then indeed we live in a chemical universe, where one planet &quot;pollutes&quot;
another with seeds of life. This no doubt is an interesting thought, worthwhile
to consider in our quest of Nature's secrets in outer space and other worlds.</P>

<P>We have high temperatures in the Earth's ionosphere. About 180 miles
up, where the cosmic solar rays strike the outer region of our atmosphere,
a tremendous friction is generated from he disintegration of atmospheric
molecules. Temperatures of up to 1800 degrees fahrenheit have been measured
there. Could it be that the high temperature readings of the planet Venus
found their origin in the Venusian ionosphere as our spacecraft descended
through it? This is certainly something to consider.</P>

<P>Another interesting explanation concerning temperatures is that the
sun is positive and the planets are negative, and all are floating in a
sea of electromagnetic energy. Solar rays are attracted by each planetary
body differently in intensity and velocity, according to the size of the
planet. If this is correct, it would explain why the temperatures in outer
space are 360 degrees below zero, no matter whether it is in space, around
Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, or even farther out. It would also explain
why the larger planets such as Jupiter and Saturn reflect more heat. If
the Sun sends out heat, then why is it 360 degrees below zero in outer
space? The gravity of Jupiter and Saturn is much higher than Earth's gravity.
In this case, should my ideas be correct, these larger planets would attract
the solar rays with a much higher velocity and intensity than Venus and
the Earth and even the Moon. In fact, cosmic ray bombardment on the Moon
should be one-sixth in intensity in this case.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the friction generated on Jupiter and Saturn when
these rays strike their atmosphere, causes these planets to receive heat
and warmth. This explains from whence their heat is generated.</P>

<P>According to present theories, any planet farther out than Mars is an
ice world or frozen rock. This theory was shaken when our recent Voyager
spacecraft discovered volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io. In fact,
Jupiter and Saturn have been compared to individual solar systems, with
many of their satellites, of which more and more are discovered each day,
producing nothing but mysteries for us. Granted that my idea does not prove
that it is correct, but at least I offer some explanation regarding a multitude
of unexplained questions.</P>

<P>On the other hand, our old accepted theories certainly have not produced
any satisfactory explanations either. In other words, their ideas are neither
better nor worse than mine.</P>

<P>The next planet I would like to mention is Mars. When the United States
succeeded in the successful landing of the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft in
1976, there was great rejoicing among the people of the Earth. This was
an achievement well worthy of the celebration. After the excitement abated
somewhat, certain nagging questions surfaced concerning some of the reports
released to the public regarding the planet Mars. I covered these events
thoroughly and in 1976, in late Autumn, I was compelled to write and article
for a national magazine, entitled &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. This article
was also later reprinted in Europe and Japan. I herewith reproduce it,
with only minor changes.</P>

<P>&quot;For centuries man, on this earth, has wondered whether or not
'life' existed elsewhere on the distant planets that could be seen passing
through the heavens at night. Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, together
with Venus, our second closest neighbor, would be the most logical places
to assume that there is life close to what we know it to be.</P>

<P>&quot;It probably all started with the Italian astronomer, Giovanni
Schiaparelli, who in 1877, reported the famous 'Canali' or canals on Mars.
Only intelligent beings could have built such structures, it was suggested.</P>

<P>&quot;Later, at the turn of the century, Percival Lowell, who, from
his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1906, became the ranking expert
on Mars' observations. He, too, reported and supported Schiaparelli's 'Canali'.</P>

<P>&quot;Still later, the world renowned newscaster and actor Orson Wells
succeeded in frightening millions of Americans with his famous radio broadcast
of 1938, War of the World, portraying it as a real life invasion by beings
from Mars landing in New Jersey.</P>

<P>&quot;Decades later, during the 1960's, Soviet astronomers announced
to an astonished scientific world that their close studies of the planet
Mars had revealed that both moons of the Red Planet were thought to be
artificial man-made satellites. Their observations, based on several very
puzzling facts, led to this conclusion. Both of the Martians 'moons' were
orbiting too close to the planet, only 3700 miles away. Normally they should
crash into the planet in time. Also both moons reflected too much light
to be natural. Probably the most puzzling fact of all was that both are
orbiting the planet in a clockwise direction. All other known planetary
bodies and satellites whirl in a counterclockwise direction&gt; Even the
entire Milky Way galaxy with its countless number of stars turns counterclockwise,
but not the two little moons of Mars. Granted, the idea of two orbiting
bodies, one five miles in diameter and the other ten miles being artificial,
is a bit controversial and stretches the imagination.</P>

<P>&quot;November 16, 1969, a noted space scientist and astronomer, the
late Dr. Harold C. Urey, stated some things just as startling as his Soviet
colleagues. Dr. Urey, speaking at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston,
Texas, said, &quot;We should be very careful in sending manned spacecraft
to the planet Mars as the 'life' there may be hostile and could prevent
the astronauts from returning to earth.&quot; Dr. Urey was a Nobel prize
winner in chemistry. In the same article he also defended the space program,
stating that we can afford it, for it costs only one-half of one percent
of the gross national product.</P>

<P>&quot;Turning the pages to 1976 and our recent Viking Missions to the
Red Planet, it seems that we have certainly proven all these men wrong,
or have we? It may surprise some of you, but after endless hours of study
and investigation into our two missions to Mars, I must say NO, we have
NOT proven these men wrong at all. In the following pages I shall endeavor
to explain my findings for your own evaluation in the most logical way
possible.</P>

<P>&quot;The reaction of the general public can be broken down as follows:
40% were disappointed in the total negative viewpoint of the Viking mission,
and 50% definitely believe that intelligent life does exist on Mars and
that the officials in charge of the program are covering up for some reason,
while 10% think that the Viking probes were not sent to Mars at all but
rather to the Moon. All in all, there exists a great public mistrust of
our officials and their ethics. Undoubtedly, some mistrust is present due
to the past cover-ups and accusations that have come forth from some of
our government agencies, one against the other.</P>

<P>&quot;I do feel that we managed to land these two probes on the planet
Mars, but that their true findings and most pictures are classified material
which to this day have not been shown.</P>

<P>&quot;My research has resulted in the following findings:</P>

<P>&quot;We were told that Mars is about one-half the size of the earth,
with a surface gravity of about 40% in relation to our own earth and that
the atmospheric pressure is some 7.7 millibars in comparison to about one
thousand milibars on earth. The Martian atmospheric density is reported
to be less that 1% of that of earth. We were also told that the Martian
temperatures in Fahrenheit ranged from -22 degrees below zero at early
afternoon to -122 degrees below zero at night. Viking One, which landed
close to the Martian equator, recorded a colder temperature than Viking
Two, which touched down some one thousand miles farther north, closer to
the polar caps.</P>

<P>Atmospheric measurements. The argon content of the Martain atmosphere
was not 30% as they had thought but only 3%. A mistake of the same magnitude
was admitted when a much higher water vapor reading was received then we
have thought possible from earth measurements.</P>

<P>&quot;Dr. George Sands, of Mission Control, stated, 'It is obviously
wetter than we anticipated. There is ground fog at the landing site during
part of the day. Thirty microns of water have been found in the atmosphere,
enough to cause not only ground fog but also frost and snow.'</P>

<P>&quot;I am not a scientist, but I have studied meteorology enough to
be able to say that the evidence of ground fog on Mars proves that temperatures
there are much warmer than we are told by the official reports. Ground
fog is a product of warm moist air moving across cool land masses or water.
Ground fog, as with any type of fog, is a product of temperatures above
the freezing level of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.</P>

<P>&quot;It is also interesting to note that evaporation clouds have been
photographed at an estimated altitude of fifteen thousand feet AGL (above
ground level). I can assure you that condensation clouds or any other clouds
including simple ground fog cannot exist at the reported atmospheric pressure
of only 7.7 millibars. Evaporation clouds on earth may reach up to forty
thousand feet, but even at that altitude our atmospheric pressure is still
two hundred millibars, enough to support such clouds.</P>

<P>&quot;We are told that evaporation clouds exist up to fifteen thousand
feet on Mars. The temperatures, therefore, must be ABOVE the freezing point
of 32 degrees Fahrenheit up to at least fifteen thousand feet. When rising
moist air moves upward it condenses at a given altitude and forms clouds
at given altitudes depending upon the temperatures. This we call the dewpoint
level. One must note at this point that low temperatures such as the reported
-122 degrees Fahrenheit on Mars may certainly exist in certain zones but
not everywhere. We have recorded temperatures of -127 degrees Fahrenheit
here on Earth at the Antarctica, and we know that life exists here on this
planet.</P>

<P>&quot;Regarding the Viking landers, we find some other unexplained points
to ponder.</P>

<P>&quot;The Viking landers were reported to have an earth weight of twelve
hundred pounds. According to our reports of the Martian gravity the landers
would weigh approximately four hundred eighty pounds. The parachute was
fifty feet in diameter. A fifty foot parachute with a weight of four hundred
eighty pounds dangling from it would slow that payload down sufficiently
in the earth's atmosphere for a proper adjustment in velocity at retro-rocket
firing. However, in the low density fo the Martain atmosphere, as we are
told (less than one percent of ours), a fifty foot parachute would have
no slowing effect at all. It is even doubtful that in the legendary atmosphere
there exists enough air molecules to open the chute. Calculating the size
of the parachute needed in such a thin atmosphere, the canopy would have
to be some seventy five hundred feet in diameter. The question then arises
where would such a thing be stored and what would such a load weigh? Certainly
at least two thousand pounds. It would take up about two hundred square
feet of space to store it. That is more cubic space and weight than the
entire lander itself. So, since they did use a fifty foot chute the air
on Mars is much more dense than they tell us. I would say a density of
about 40% of that of earth.</P>

<P>&quot;The lander on the fifty foot chute separated at four thousand
feet AGL, and activated its three descent rockets, which, like gigantic
blow torches, slowed down the craft to a successful soft landing. However,
the three rocket engines develop not only thousands of degrees of heat
but immense thrust. These two factors not only completely sterilized the
landing site before touchdown, but blew away all the soil of biological
value for a least one hundred feet surrounding the lander. We should question
the ability to find any signs of life in such soil. The scientists should
have questioned this. Maybe they did. In the meantime, that little shovel
keeps on digging and searching in that sterilized soil.</P>

<P>&quot;The magazine 'Scientific American' had this to say in a recent
article on Mars: 'The Martian environment is by no means so hostile as
to exclude LIFE. Our hopes for obtaining a definitive answer from the Viking
mission should not be too high.'</P>

<P>&quot;Other interesting points are to be found. For example, sand dunes
on Mars photographed by the 'orbiter' have the same height and the same
dune to dune spacing as earth's sand dunes to be found in the Sangre de
Christo mountains in Colorado. In a Martain atmosphere of less than one
percent of ours these sand dunes could under no circumstances be there!</P>

<P>&quot;It has been suggested that hurricane-like winds of two hundred
mph or better are needed to move these grains of sand on Mars but up to
now there has been no logical explanation as to where these two hundred
mph winds come from in a total sub-zero environment. Again, Mars must be
warmer in at least some regions to create wind of any speed in the first
place. As we know, wind is created by warm air rising from the ground to
be replaced by colder air masses filling in the gap. The Viking lander
only recorded winds up to forty mph, not two hundred. So, how did the dunes
get there? Even better, how did the wind get there in an atmosphere that
is only one percent of earth's and at a temperature of -120 degrees Fahrenheit?</P>

<P>&quot;I think that we have to be sensible about all of this, for it
can be seen that too many things just don't seem to make logical sense.
Certainly if we can figure this out the scientists and others working on
the project can. Some talk from both sides of the mouth does seem to be
taking place.</P>

<P>&quot;Viking 2 reveals that the polar caps of Mars are plain snow, just
frozen water. Also, that it snows often, and the atmosphere above the poles
is saturated with water vapor. Sounds good? Let us continue. A NASA article
reports that the poles of Mars are all frozen water with temperatures of
-90 degrees Fahrenheit to -120 degrees Fahrenheit. The article continues
by saying, 'The North Pole is now going through its summer, so the ice
cap is as small as it ever gets.' I would like to know how ice in sub-zero
temperatures as reported above can MELT!</P>

<P>&quot;Dr. Martin, who has just recently resigned his position with Pasadena
Viking Control, said at the International Academy of Astronautics, 'Our
biology instruments on Mars have received positive signs of LIFE in forms
of biology even though we cannot find organics.' It is amazing that they
have found even those little signs at such a blow-torched landing site.</P>

<P>&quot;Analysis of the Martian environment has so far shown that there
is carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sufficient amounts of water vapor. Are
not these the basic ingredients for LIFE?</P>

<P>&quot;Quoting NASA from Pasadena, 'If we would have placed the Viking
landers in our Pasadena parking lot and received the same chemical and
biological readings from there as we are now receiving from Mars, we would
have called it a definite sign of life.' I leave it to you to figure out
what the might mean.</P>

<P>&quot;I feel that so long as we are going to send probes out to other
worlds with our assumptions that life is unique only to our little earth,
instead of being able to see that all worlds are basically made up of the
same 'stuff', we shall continue to be plagued with unyielding difficulties
and insoluble questions.</P>

<P>&quot;Planets do not only receive warmth from their sun in forms of
friction by rays striking their atmospheres, but also by the same process,
warmth from the planet is drawn out of its body, radiating and warming
up the atmosphere. All planets need an atmosphere simply to equalize the
pressures set up from within. No planet could exist without air, for it
would disintegrate otherwise in a given time.</P>

<P>&quot;The water quantity on Mars has been analyzed to be sufficient
to cover their whole planet with an ocean of ONE MILE in depth, should
all its water now in and under the ground be released. While the polar
caps themselves show a thickness measuring one-half mile.</P>

<P>&quot;Perhaps the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli's earlier reports
of the Martian channels do not all seem so impossible when they are compared
with Dr. Daniel J. Milton's recent findings. Dr. Milton, a geologist with
the U.S. Geological Survey, stated in 'Science Newsfront': 'We have photographed
the Martian mystery channels. They resemble huge flood channels some twenty-four
miles wide and several hundred miles long, shaped by sudden discharges
of water that dwarf the flow of the Amazon River.'</P>

<P>&quot;Finally, here is a report from the wires of the AP: 'New pictures
of Mars' northern regions reveal mysterious patters, resembling contour
plowing on the planet's red surface and scientists say they cannot find
a natural explanation. 'We are getting some strange things. It is very
puzzling,' said Michael Carr, member of the team interpreting pictures
of Mars from the Viking 2 orbiter. Carr stated that the newest pictures
of the target zone showed striped patterns that resemble an aerial photograph
of a farmer's field after plowing. 'The stripes are too regular to be of
natural causes,' Carr stated. But what caused them? 'I really can't tell
you all of the possibilities that were suggested.' Carr responded. 'But
many suggestions were that it was MAN MADE.'</P>

<P>&quot;I would like to point out the most important fact that the suggestion
of man-made plowing by the Viking scientists was made AFTER Viking One
could not find life on Mars as we were looking for it.</P>

<P>&quot;To conclude this article, I would like to give credit where credit
is due and report that even as we receive double talk on the extra-terrestrial
findings, we have, as a civilization, gained enormous knowledge by venturing
out into space. We have learned more about our earth from out there by
observation and photography than is presently realized by the general public.
Space satellites placed into earth orbit have revealed our global pollution
problems. We have learned about the weather patterns, the ocean currents,
mineral deposits, soil analysis, flood control, forestry service, and higher
yield agricultural areas, both presently cultivated and those as yet unused.</P>

<P>&quot;Through out earth orbiting probes we have also found that we are
not always perfect. In the early days we received reports that life could
not exist even on our own planet. Those probes reported back that there
was not enough water vapor or oxygen to support life as we know it on Earth!
Therefore we know that the probes are not always accurate. Much depends
upon the pressures and amount of magnetism that surrounds the probes in
space when the readings are taken.</P>

<P>&quot;As it is yet to be revealed, Man's futures on this earth will
depend upon outer space research and exploration for it is from out there
that he will be able to evaluate that small world he now calls 'home'.
But one day when things become unbearable, we will be forced to venture
out to find other worlds ready for inhabitation.</P>

<P>&quot;Every dollar spend in this program is well spent. It can keep
many busy in the peaceful way, while he is learning. The space program
has all the potentials to allow man to one day explore space and work together
as brothers, so thoroughly occupied in it, that there is no time left for
foolish wars that only add additional woes and miseries to mankind.</P>

<P>&quot;Man calls himself the most intelligent creature on Earth. He will
soon have the Golden Opportunity to prove it.&quot;</P>

<P>Bradford D. Smith, NASA scientist and head of the 1980 Voyager's photographic
mission to Saturn, had this statement to make, which I feel covers or explains
some of the mysteries that have baffled us about outer space. Smith stated,
&quot;With any scientific investigation of this magnitude, many of our
long-standing theories-those cherished interpretations of the Universe
around us, are going to become casualties.&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founder and director of NASA's Goddard Institute
for space studies, was interviewed by science reported Marcia Golub of
the Special Science Digest magazine, Spring edition of 1980. In this revealing
article, titled &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, Dr. Jastrow states very positively
that life exists there. From his studies of the Viking data, there is no
doubt, Jastrow admitted, that at least some form of primitive life exists
on Mars.</P>

<P>Dr. Jastrow now teaches at both Columbia University and Darthmouth College.
&quot;But even primitive life forms such as microbes are quite complicated
forms of life,&quot; Dr. Jastroy concluded, &quot;because these would settle
the question: 'Is Life common in the cosmos?' We can be sure that humanity
is not alone, that planets circling other stars must be swarming with life,
and that in solar systems older than ours, this life may be far more advanced
than humanity on Earth.&quot;</P>

<P>Reporter Golub asked Dr. Jastrow this important question: &quot;Do you
think there is life on Mars? Some scientists disagree. Why?&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Jastrow answered, &quot;My only comment is that scientific caution
is fine if you spend $30.00 of your own money. But if you spend millions
of dollars of somebody else's money, you have to stand the heat. Also scientists
are very sensitive to being wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>During the Viking 1 microbe test on Mars, nutrients with radioactive
carbon was the food presented to possible Martian microbes. If the microbes
ate the food, they would exhale radioactive carbon dioxide, and if the
geiger counter clicked, the microbes were eating the food. The geiger counter
clicked thousands of times. While many of the Viking scientists tried to
explain this positive result as a way of being merely a chemical reaction,
several others, such as Dr. Jastrow, for instance, insisted that this reaction
was a biological one. As a matter of fact, the Viking 2 test produced exactly
the same positive reaction, as the Martian microbes ate away the radioactive
carbon laden nutrients. Nevertheless, the arguments continued as to whether
these tests were chemical or biological reactions.</P>

<P>The soil samples were stored for several months in the Viking lander
storage area and the microbe test was again repeated, and this time the
geiger counter signal disappeared. Dr. Jastrow explains that if one stores
living organisms in the dark, without food and water for several months,
they die.</P>

<P>This was the convincing fact arguing for the existence of Martian microbes,
as the first sign of life on Mars. Dr. Jastrow also stated that Dr. Levin,
who did the microbe test, also believes that these test results prove life
on Mars. But using Jastrow's own words, &quot;Dr. Levin has been a little
restrained by peer pressure from the Viking team.&quot;</P>

<P>Chief biologist Chuck Klein now admits that on the basis of the Viking
1 and 2 microbe tests, the conclusion would have to be drawn that metabolizing
organisms were definitely present in all the samples tested. &quot;That
means life on Mars exists,&quot; Dr. Klein stated.</P>

<P>Dr. Jastrow concludes with these remarks: &quot;The taxpayer got a better
return on the money he invested in Mars than he realized, but nobody has
told him. It has killed the Mars exploration program.&quot;</P>

<P>In certain scientific circles, it has been common knowledge for quite
some time now, that life exists on the Moon, on Mars, and many other planets
as well. Just because the general public is not aware of this fact does
not make it less true. While Dr. Jastrow is a very cautious man, revealing
only primitive life forms on Mars, other scientists are more outspoken.</P>

<P>One retired physicist with whom I had the privilege of spending an afternoon,
in the summer of 1980, discussed life on other worlds, UFOs, and their
propulsion methods quite openly with me. This gentleman related to me,
with revealing candor, that several friends of his, all top scientists,
had been taken to the Moon and Mars by the extraterrestrials. There are
several secret bases here on Earth, above the 15,000 foot level in mountainous
areas, where alien spacecraft land. These voyages, this scientist acknowledged
to me, are not joy rides, but have an extremely valuable scientific purpose.</P>

<P>In addition, George Adamski reported in his book, Inside The Space Ships,
that on many of his voyages into space, during the 1950's, top scientists
were also taken along. Whatever these gentlemen learned from these voyages
were later put into constructive use, without revealing the source of their
information.</P>

<P>Adamski was also told by his contacts that while the air is very thin
on the Moon, there are certain areas where even Earth men could walk around
without a space suit and air tanks, but it would take twenty-four hours
of depressurization to get their bodies acclimated to this condition. He
was also told that those men from other planets visiting the Moon must
experience the same procedure of depressurization.</P>

<P>The scientist with whom I conversed in the summer of 1980 revealed to
me very much the same information. He stated that when this group of selected
scientists reached the Moon, they were told by their hosts they could take
a walk on the surface without space suits. Nevertheless, they were given
small oxygen bottles with the explanation that they would feel very ill,
very shortly, in those conditions to which they were unaccustomed. They
did not go through twenty-four hours of depressurization. This group was
later taken to planet Mars where they, to their surprise, found it to be
inhabited with human beings. They were told that about six hundred million
people live on Mars, and that the surface air pressure at sea level was
equal to a 20,000 foot altitude here on earth. Since Mars is a bit smaller
than one-half of Earth, this air pressure seemed to be sufficient enough
there because of less gravitational attraction. A one hundred pound Earth
person would weigh less than fifty pounds on Mars.</P>

<P>Even though this story sounds rather fantastic, I have no reason to
disbelieve this gentleman, who struck me as a very mentally alert and honest
man, still engaged in electromagnetic research in a private capacity. As
a matter of fact, he too has been invited to take the same trip into outer
space as his friends did some time ago. He told me that he would share
all the information upon his return, whenever that will be.</P>

<P>The book, Alternative 3, speaks of a secret Mars mission by the U.S.A.
and the U.S.S.R. in 1962. According to the authors of this book, a copy
of this secret Mars tape and the special decoder were stolen from NASA
in the United States, and transported to Britain via Canada. There this
tape was shown to top officials and scientists in the late 70's. This tape
revealed that on May 22, 1962, these two super powers, in a consolidated
effort, landed a remote-controlled spacecraft on Mars, which reported a
temperature and atmospheric pressure sufficient to support life as we know
it. Alternative 3 was written by three well-known British television reporters,
which produced a TV program with that same title, shown by the BBC TV network
in 1977, with the book following in June, 1979. The retired physicist who
had presented me with the information concerning the Moon and Mars, also
pointed out to me that the book Alternative 3, contained a vast amount
of truth.</P>

<P>Searching for this type of truth is not an easy matter because the governments
involved in such projects prefer to clamp a tight lid on their findings.
However, in time, the truth will always be revealed, because only a few
men can take such secrets into their graves, and sooner or later, information
will leak out.</P>

<P>To receive the total picture of the truth, those of us who are interested
in finding it must never cease to investigate every little part of it,
patiently piecing together the puzzle picture until we see it clearly.
It has been said that &quot;Man know the truth and it shall make you free.&quot;
The involvement of man's intellect or his mind alone is not enough, as
often truth is revealed to us through intuitive feeling, or hunches, which
come to us through conscious awareness.</P>

<P>I feel that man will have no chance to see the total picture of truth,
unless he uses both elements of his being, his mind and his conscious awareness,
in harmony. Only then he will be able to see the total picture of the truth
and at the same time be capable of handling it.</P>
