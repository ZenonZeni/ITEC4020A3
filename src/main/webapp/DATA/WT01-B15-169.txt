<BODY>
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (the Board), an organization created by Congress to
provide technical and scientific evaluation of activities undertaken by the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), issued two reports on the OCRWM Program earlier
this year, entitled the <cite>Report to the U.S. Congress and the Secretary of Energy &#150 1995 Findings
and Recommendations</cite> (April 1996) and <cite>Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel &#150 Finding
the Right Balance </cite>(March 1996).<P>
<P>
In its April report, the Board stated that OCRWM has made significant progress in a number of
areas despite the budgetary, programmatic, and regulatory uncertainties facing the Program. The
report praised OCRWM for greatly increasing efficiency of underground tunnel operations at the
Yucca Mountain site, obtaining essential data about the character and hydrology of the rock at
the proposed repository level, beginning to formulate a clear and technically defensible waste
isolation strategy, and improving the Program's focus and effectiveness.<P>
<P>
The April report also included the Board's recommendations that OCRWM continue
development and articulation of the waste isolation strategy, begin long-term tunnel-scale
thermal testing as quickly as possible, use total system performance assessments to refine and
test the basic tenets of the waste isolation strategy, and pursue a corrosion research program for
candidate waste package materials. OCRWM addressed these and the Board's 14 other
recommendations in a letter dated October 3, 1996.<P>
<P>
The March 1996 report, noting the renewed emphasis on storage of spent nuclear fuel as a result
of delays in the repository program, concluded that there is no compelling technical or safety
reason to move spent fuel to a central facility for the next several years. This conclusion is in
conflict with some proposals currently before the Congress that would hasten the development of
Federal interim storage. The Board's report also stated that interim storage will be needed in the
future in order to add flexibility to the system once a repository begins operating and to relieve
utilities of the need to build on-site storage at shutdown reactors. The report, which praised
recent progress in site characterization at Yucca Mountain, concluded by saying that there is no
technical reason why interim storage cannot be initiated prior to the commencement of repository
operations.<P>
<P>
The Board also held two meetings in the past several months to discuss issues related to the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program. The Board meetings provide an effective
public forum to discuss technical issues between scientific experts and interested parties. During
these meetings, representatives of OCRWM and the Board discussed a wide range of subjects,
including an update on the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), plans for the disposal of defense
wastes, activities related to establishing an environmental standard for Yucca Mountain site
investigations associated with climatology and hydrology, and Program budget priorities.<P>
<P>
At the meeting held April 30 - May 1, 1996, OCRWM staff and contractors discussed aspects of
the Program's plans that have been revised as a result of funding reductions and guidance from
the President and Congress. OCRWM Deputy Director Lake Barrett presented an overview of the
revised Program described in the 

<a href="/pages/intro/planltr.htm"><cite>Draft Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</cite></a>,
Revision 1 (<a href="01entprs.htm">see related article</a>). The Board expressed a strong interest in
the Program's strategy for determining the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site.<P>
<P>
Dr. Stephan Brocoum, Assistant Manager for Licensing at the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Office, discussed the technical basis for the revised site characterization
program. Dr. Brocoum noted that the recent synthesis of the data collected from more than a
decade of surface-based investigations of Yucca Mountain and the observations and testing from
the ESF have appreciably enhanced our understanding of Yucca Mountain. This understanding
has made it possible to further focus the remaining work required to support the viability
assessment, evaluation of site suitability, and preparation of a license application.<P>
<P>
Mr. Dwight Shelor, Deputy Director of the Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation, updated the Board on plans for redirecting the waste acceptance, storage, and
transportation functions. The revised approach implements a market-driven strategy that relies on
competitive contracts with the private sector.<P>
<P>
The Board also met July 9 - 10, 1996, in Denver, Colorado, to review recent progress in the
investigations at Yucca Mountain and to examine the detail of OCRWM's climatology and
hydrology studies. An update on the substantial progress in the construction of the ESF, as the
tunnel boring machine has reached the turn for the south ramp following completion of the main
loop, and the results of surface-based and underground investigations were provided to the
Board. The update on the testing program highlighted the information being obtained from
mapping and sampling activities in the ESF. The correlation of features mapped underground
with surface mapping and model predictions is enhancing the understanding of the geology and
structural features of the Yucca Mountain site. The underground sampling activities are
providing insights regarding the flow of water through the mountain. These insights are essential
to understanding the site and assessing the performance of a potential repository located
there.<P>
<P>
The majority of the meeting was spent reviewing the climatology investigations and modeling,
and the related aspects of the hydrology program. The discussions included a series of technical
presentations on the latest results of investigations, and the use of the data and its implications
for performance assessments. The meeting culminated in a round-table discussion involving the
Board and its staff, Program participants, representatives of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the State of Nevada, and invited experts on the significance and interpretation
of the information presented during the 2-day meeting.<P>
<P>
In addition to issuing reports and interacting with the Program during public meetings, the Board
continues to communicate its interest in geologic issues at Yucca Mountain through other means.
For example, in late May, the Board wrote a letter to the Secretary of Energy and Members of
Congress commenting on the recent discovery of elevated levels of chlorine-36 in some of the
rock samples collected from the ESF <a href="11entprs.htm">(see related article)</a>, the importance
of completing the waste containment and isolation strategy, and the progress of tunneling the
ESF. The Department responded on July 8 by describing the status of activities related to these
issues &#150 issues OCRWM plans to address further.<P>
