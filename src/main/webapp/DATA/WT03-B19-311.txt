<P>
To enable businesses, governments and researchers to share the vast data resources of the Internet, new methods and technologies are required to search, extract, deliver and combine data to create information which has commercial and social relevance.
The Research Data Network CRC was established in 1994 to undertake research, development and education in the effective application of telecommunication network technologies, using the 'next generation' network, known as the Experimental Broadband Network (EBN). EBN will be significantly faster and carry much greater volumes of data over interstate distances, than has been possible before.
The CRC brings together major commercial companies and research institutions with a view to developing Australia's position in the network technology and applications arena.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Research focuses on identifying and developing new network services that allow organisations to gain competitive advantage or improve the efficiency and quality of service. Four main research projects explore different technical issues and user needs:
<UL>
<LI>Geographically dispersed high-performance computers are being linked to operate as one super-powerful computer.
<LI>Effective information retrieval systems are being developed for exploiting the information on the world’s databases.
<LI>Interactive multimedia information is being distributed over network systems.
<LI>Cost-effective access to advanced information and communications services such as desktop video conferencing and multimedia databases is being developed.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The Internet and the related World Wide Web undoubtedly represent the single phenomenon most likely to change the face of the world community as we know it today. Commercial organisations who fail to recognise the competitive advantages and organisational implications of emerging network technologies are liable to find themselves struggling in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. The CRC is committed to maintaining Australia's position as one of the forerunners in network technology.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The centre is administered at Monash University in Melbourne, with partners at research establishments in each major city in Australia. This national structure is crucial in establishing an extensive and realistic network testbed for Victorian applications developers and Victorian organisations, with an interest in using networks for communications and data transfer.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC has a range of short courses in telecommunications network technology for industry and research participants and can tailor these to request if demand is sufficient. Given the fast-moving nature of the technology, interaction and suggestions from industry are welcomed.
<P>

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The opportunities and challenges for businesses arising from developing network technology are manifold. We are entering a new era in communication and data transfer which could bring effects as profound as the telephone itself. Areas such as centralisation of administration, video conferencing, data base access and dissemination of information are just some of the opportunities that will flow from network technology.
The CRC actively encourages the participation of any commercial or non-commercial entity interested in the use of network technology in their work. Any level of participation is welcomed, from major strategic research, to specific project development.
Any organisation which is actively considering the implications of emerging network technology and applications, either operationally or strategically, should have some level of contact with the CRC, even if only to make initial enquiries.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The centre has been established with funding for five years, consisting of $13 million from the Australian Government, $21 million cash contribution from participants, and $9.5 million in-kind contributions from participants.
