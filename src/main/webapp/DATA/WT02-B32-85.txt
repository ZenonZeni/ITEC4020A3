<h4>Proposal to amend the miscellaneous additives Directive 95/2 (additives other than colours and sweeteners)</h4>

The Commission has published its formal proposal for amending Directive 95/2 (COM(96)303).  It has been circulated by MAFF for comment.
<p>
The proposal takes on board various points agreed at the Commission Working Group (5th March) and incorporates certain industry requests not included in an earlier draft.  The Ministry letter comments on the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Flour treatment agents are not included in the proposal.  The UK has asked for these to be dealt with separately at a later stage and MAFF have suggested that a timetable for legislation should be agreed.
<li>A definitive opinion from the EC's SCF on requests which have been made for additional additives in foods for infants and young children not in good health is unlikely to be available until later in the year.  The Commission is therefore unable to made a formal proposal for associated amendments to 95/2.
</ul>
A number of specific amendments relating to certain additives and certain foods have been proposed - the proposal (or the letter from MAFF) should be consulted for full details.
<p>
No date has been given for discussion on the proposal at a Council Working Group.

<h4>Proposed revision to Directive on Extraction Solvents</h4>

The Commission has published proposals to amend Directive 88/344 on Extraction Solvents used in the Production of Food stuffs and Food Ingredients.
<p>
The proposed text would make the following amendments to the Directive:
<ul>
<li>provide for the amendment of the conditions of use and maximum residue levels for permitted extraction solvents to be made by the Commission following the procedure laid down in Article 6 of the Directive (i.e. involving the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs);
<li>remove butyl acetate and methyl-propanol-1 from the list of permitted extraction solvents;
<li>allow the use of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluroethane for the preparation of flavourings from natural flavouring materials;
<li>reduce the maximum residue level for hexane resulting from its use in the production or fractionation of fats and oils and production of cocoa butter (from 5 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg)
</ul>
<p>
The proposal is based on Article 100a of the Treaty and subject to the co-decision procedure. The Commission hopes to reach a Common Position by December 1996.

<h4>Amendment to the Natural Mineral Waters Directive</h4>

A proposal to amend the Directive relating to natural mineral waters (Directive 80/777) was published by the Commission in November 1994.  A Common Position was adopted in December 1995 and two further amendments were adopted by the European Parliament at Second Reading on 22 May 1996.
<p>
The amended proposal, including the two European Parliament amendments, was adopted by qualified majority on 23 July 1996.  The main objectives of the amending Directive are to take account of technical and scientific progress since 1980 and to rationalise the provisions of the Directive to bring them into line with other provisions of Community food law.  The changes include:
<ul>
<li>extending the period of recognition for natural mineral waters originating from third countries in order to simplify the administrative process;
<li>clarifying the circumstances under which the use of ozone-enriched air may be permitted in order to separate unstable elements from natural mineral waters under conditions which will ensure that the composition of the water as regards its essential constituents is not affected;
<li>making the inclusion of the statement of the analytical composition of a natural mineral water on the label compulsory;
<li>laying down certain provisions on spring waters;
<li>introducing procedures to allow for coordinated action between Member States in urgent situations which may present a risk to public health;
<li>providing for a committee procedure for the adoption of certain additional technical provisions.
</ul>
<p>
Member States must permit trade in products complying with the new provisions within 12 months and prohibit trade in products not complying with them within 24 months (although products labelled before that time may continue to be sold).

<h4>Eggs Sizes - Publication of Amending Regulation (1511/96)</h4>

As previously described (see <a href="#96-23">17 July 1996</a>), the Commission has adopted a Regulation which amends Regulation 1274/91 which itself introduced detailed rules for implementing Regulation 1907/90 on certain marketing standards for eggs.
<p>
The new Regulation is No 1511/96, published in the Official Journal No L189, 30.7.96, p91.
<p>
The letter points out that as well as introducing new eggs sizes, the Regulation allows for supplementary indications on the type of farming.  The Commission indicates that this is aiming "to authorize supplementary indications to the terms laid down for the various types of farming, which refer to the particular characteristics of the respective type of farming but not to authorize other terms or general statements."  MAFF may circulate additional advice on this aspect.

<h4>Organic Livestock Farming</h4>

Livestock farmers would be able to market their produce in the EU in line with recognised organic standards, under a Regulation proposed by the Commission this week.  It also includes strict labelling and qualilty rules to avoid abuse of the term "organic" and to increase consumer confidence.  The measures would cover the main apsects of the animal production process for cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and bees.
<p>
<i>It is assumed that the proposal would supplement the measures already in place which largely cover crops other than animals.  More details will be provided when available</i>.
<p>

<a name="96-23"></a><i>MAFF Letter, 17 July 1996</i>

<h4>Egg Sizes - Further Discussions</h4>

The Commission's revised draft proposal (See earlier items on Egg Size Grades <a href="l-eu-96a.htm#96-15">25 June 1996</a>) was considered by the Eggs and Poultry Management Committee on 16 July.
<p>
The following grades would be defined:<br>
<ul>
<li>               XL - VERY LARGE: 73g and more
<li>               L - LARGE: from 63g up to 73g
<li>               M - MEDIUM: from 53g up to 63g
<li>               S - SMALL: under 53g
</ul>
To avoid ambiguity, an amendment to the original revised proposal was made and it now states "On packs, the weight grading would be indicated by the respective letter or by the respective terms .... or by a combination of both, which may be supplemented by the corresponding weight ranges." 
<p>
The text was voted on.  The MAFF letter states: "The vote resulted in the Committee failing to deliver an opinion as two countries abstained and two countries opposed.  This is not a negative opinion nor is it a favourable one.  The procedure will be that the Commission submit the text to internal written procedure and providing there are no objections to the text it will be published as law in the Official Journal.  If there are no objections this will be before the intended effective date of 1 August 1996."  The main transition period will last until 30 June 1997.

<h4>Simplifcation of EU Veterinary Legislation</h4>

MAFF has responded to the Commission on the issue of the simplification of the animal and public health (hygiene) directives.  In response to the Commissions consultative document issued in April 1996 [see earlier item dated <a href="l-eu-96a.htm#96-12">19 April 1996</a>], the UK Government has submitted comments to Brussels.  The Government has welcomed the DGVI initiative which it believes should result in better legislation to secure effective public health protection, and better regulation for a competitive business environment.
<p>
Certain general observations have been made and the following are some of the points made:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>General</b>: "We favour a risk based approach to hygiene controls and their enforcement, and believe such an approach should facilitate significant simplification of hygiene directives and lead to the removal of prescriptive requirements wherever possible.  We believe it should be possible to consolidate hygiene legislation into a single instrument, keeping in view that legislation should be shown to be necessary, proportionate to risk and take account of SME interests."
<p>
<li><b>Scope</b>:  "The Guide makes no mention of the interrelationship between the general and the product specific hygiene rules.  In order to achieve a successful continuum of legislation from "farm to fork", we would suggest the common provisions be aligned with the general food hygiene directive.  This would be more efficient and reassuring for consumers in public health terms because there would be greater transparency, consistency and user-friendliness in the legislation.  It would also help industry and enforcement agencies to have a clear understanding of their respective roles in ensuring safe food."
<p>
<li><b>Own Checks</b>:  "We welcome the greater emphasis on own checks, based on the principles of HACCP, which correctly places more responsibility on producers to control and monitor hygiene and safety within establishments.  It should therefore be possible to remove some of the more prescriptive requirements in the text, or at least to introduce greater flexibility in the need to follow them absolutely.  On this basis, we believe that structural and equipment requirements could be further rationalised.
<p>
"Own checks provisions should be flexibly cast to reflect more closely the Codex approach - which recognises that full documentation may not always be necessary for smaller businesses.  Documentation should be available at the time of inspection - there is no need for it to be submitted to the authorities."
<p>
<li><b>Official Checks</b>:  "The greater emphasis on own checks should be accompanied by a reappraisal of inspection procedures.  Where risk based control systems are in place the focus of any check should be on the control system.  A main purpose of visual or physical examination should be to confirm that critical points have been correctly identified and that controls are in place.  We welcome the recognition that the frequency of official checks should be related to risk, and believe that better focused, more risk related enforcement, which takes account of the controls that exist within the establishment, will provide more effective public health protection."

<h4>Mycotoxins - EC Permitted Levels</h4>

The Commission held a further meeting on mycotoxins on 12 July 1996 (See earlier item <a href="l-eu-96a.htm#96-2">3 June 1996</a>).  It now seems likely that the Commission will only press ahead at this stage with limits for aflatoxins and not including ochratoxin A and patulin.  These last two may be subject to a further Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) review before regulatory action is again considered.
<p>
The Commission is still considering levels based on "ideal sampling and optimal methods of analysis", to be agreed at a later date, which caused the UK delegation some concern that values were being discussed in isolation from these issues. 
<p>
Aflatoxin levels (in micrograms per kg) are now being proposed in the working document for:<br>
<ul>
<li>Groundnuts shelled and peeled (may be redrafted to simply "groundnuts") with sub-divisions.  Proposed levels are B1 - 5, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 10 where further treatment will take place and B1 - 2, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 4 when prepared for consumption.
<li>Nuts (including coconut); pistachios; dried fruit (figs, plums, apricots) intended for consumption without modification. Proposed levels are B1 - 2, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 4.
<li>Cereals (including maize) (may be redrafted to be "(including buckwheat)").  Proposed levels are B1 - 2, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 4
<li>Milk. Proposed level is M1 - 0.05.
</ul>
It is also likely that spices may be added following a German proposal.
<p>
The next meeting might be in September with a formal proposal for Regulation "some time later".

<h4>
Drinking Water Standards</h4>

The Commission is taking the UK to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for not fully implementing the drinking water Directive.  The reasons are, first, that some of the drinking water standards, which came mandatory in 1985, are still not being met in the UK, and second, that the system of water company "undertaking", used where standards are not being met, are not compatible with the Directive, the Commission believes.  The undertakings cannot be enforce by individuals who may be affected by drinking water that does not meet the standards.  The main problem in meeting the standards relates to the pesticides parameter, particularly in drinking water supplied to the population in the Greater London area.
<p>
The Commission has been trying to reach a settlement with the UK government since it first opened the case in 1991.  However, last month the UK government informed the Commission that it could not accept the Commission's proposals for ending the dispute.  The Commission has spared no efforts to reach a settlement, Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said, but it is unacceptable that the UK is unwilling to ensure the legally enforceable rights for its citizens to drinking water of a quality that meets EU standards, eleven years after the Directive came into force.

<h4>Common Position for Decision on the maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain foods</h4>

A Common Position was adopted on the 18th June <i>[See related item on 26 June 1996 for more background]</i>.  The Annex containing a listing of  foods for which Member States may continue to restrict additives has been extended and modified by the addition of a further 7 foods.  The Annex lists the Member States concerned, the specified foodstuffs and the categories of additives which may continue to be banned.  It now reads:<br>
<ul>
<li>Germany - Traditional German beer ("Bier nach deutschem Reinheitsgebot gebraut") - all except propellant gas
<li>Greece - "Feta" cheese - all
<li>France - Traditional French bread - all
<li>France - Traditional French preserved truffles - all
<li>France - Traditional French preserved snails - all
<li>France - Traditional French goose and duck preserves ("confit") - all except preservatives
<li>Austria - Traditional Austrian "Bergkase" - all except preservatives
<li>Finland - Traditional Finnish "Mammi" - all except preservatives
<li>Sweden/Finland - Traditional Swedish and Finnish fruit syrups - colours
<li>Denmark - Traditional Danish "Kodboller" - preservatives and colours
<li>Denmark - Traditional Danish "Leverpostej" - preservatives (other than sorbic acid) and colours
<li>Spain - Traditional Spanish "Lomo embuchado" - All except preservatives and antioxidants
<li>Italy - Traditional Italian "Salame cacciatore" - All except preservatives, antioxidants, flavour enhancers and packaging gas
<li>Italy - Traditional Italian "Mortadella" - All except preservatives, antioxidants, pH-adjusting agents, flavour enhancers, stabilizers and packaging gas
<li>Italy - Traditional Italian "Cotechino e zampone" - All except preservatives, antioxidants, pH-adjusting agents, flavour enhancers, stabilizers and packaging gas
</ul><p>
The Common Position now returns to the European Parliament for a second reading.

<h4>EU Poultry Meat Marketing Standards</h4>

The letter provides limited information on a recent change to the detailed rules contained in Regulation 1538/91 (which introduces detailed rules for implementing Regulation 1906/90 on certain marketing standards for poultry).
<p>
Following French concerns that there were poor quality capons being marketed in France, the definition of "capon" has been amended.  It previously stated:<br>
<i>"male fowl castrated surgically before having reached sexual maturity"</i>.<br>
Following the adoption of Regulation 1000/96 (published on 5 June 1996), it now reads:<br>
<i>"male fowl castrated surgically before reaching sexual maturity and slaughtered at a minimum age of 140 days; after castration the capons must be fattened for at least 77 days"</i>.
<p>
Regulation 1000/96 also makes some related changes to the references to capons in Annex IV of 1538/91, which specifies the production criteria that must be met in order to make use of certain marketing terms (e.g. free range).

<h4>Proposed Amendment to EC Regulation (2081/92) - Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin</h4>

Following the adoption by the Commission of a list of protected names under Regulation 2081/92 on the 12 June, the Commission has also published a related proposal to amend Regulation 2081/92.  The Regulation contains a provision allowing for a 5 year transitional period during which foods using a protected name can continue to use the name even though not meeting the requirements of the protected name.  However the period specified in the original Regulation was to run from the date of publication of the Regulation (24 July 1992).  This only leaves about 12 months from the time of registration.  The amendment would alter Regulation 2081/92 so as to make the transitional period run from the time of registration of a name.

<h4>Review of 7 Vertical Directives - Chocolate, Sugars, Honey, Fruit Juices, Preserved Milk, Coffee, Jams</h4>

The Commission has formally issued proposals to simplify 7 Directives which specify compositional and labelling requirements for certain foods.  The Directives were all originally agreed between 1973 and 1980.  This was before the full development of the "horizontal" labelling controls contained in Directive 79/112 and before the adoption of the "new approach" to Community food law which was incorporated into the Internal Market programme.
<p>
The seven proposals are based on a common structure consisting of an operative part followed by an Annex.  The operative part contains provisions on the scope of the Directive, labelling and the committee procedure.  The Annex contains the definitions and designations of the products and details of their composition.
<p>
The following point can be noted with regard to chocolate and cocoa - the most controversial issue.  The main difficulty here was the present position whereby certain countries have used a provision allowing them to incorporate the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter during chocolate production (up to 5% by weight).  At present this practice is permitted by UK, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Finland and Sweden, but such products can not be sold in the other Member States.  In the proposal, this practice will continue to be permitted but, under mutual recognition, their sale would be permitted throughout the Community subject to "a clear, neutral and objective indication of the presence of such substances".  Products not including the cocoa butter substitutes could include a reference on the labelling to the fact that vegetable fats have not been used in their manufacture.
<p>
The formal adoption of the proposed Directives is complicated since 2 (chocolate and coffee) were originally adopted using Article 100a of the Treaty of Rome whilst the others used Article 43.  This means that different procedures are required for their adoption.  The proposals will now be considered by the European Parliament.

<h4>Common Position on Amendment to the Miscellaneous Additives Directive (95/2/EC)</h4>

A Common Position was adopted at the Environment Council held on 25 June for a proposed directive to amend Directive 95/2/EC on Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners.  The aim of the amendment is to add the new food additive known as "E407a Processed Eucheuma Seaweed" into Annex I of the Directive for use at <i>quantum satis</i> level.  The substance had previously been given the name "alternatively refined carrageenan" but this was not acceptable to the European Parliament.  The Common Position now returns to the European Parliament for a second reading.
