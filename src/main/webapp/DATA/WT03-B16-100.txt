<h2>Synthetic Aperture Radar</h2><p>

<h4>What is SAR?</h4>
Synthetic Aperture Radar.   An active microwave instrument, producing
high-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface in all weather.<p>

There is a good introduction to imaging radar by Tony Freeman of JPL at
<a href=http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/desc/imagingradarv3.html>

<a name=SAR-SATS><h4>What are the main SAR platforms?</h4></a>
Several past, present and future Earth Observation Satellites.   Also
the Shuttle Imaging Radar missions.   See the table
for a full list.
<ul>
<li> ERS-1/ERS-2
<li> JERS-1
<li> Shuttle Imaging Radar SIR-C/X-SAR
<li> Almaz
<li> RADARSAT
</ul>
the future...

<li> ENVISAT

<a name=SAR-OPT><h4>What distinguishes SAR from hi-res optical imagery?</h4></a>
Two main properties distinguish SAR from optical imagery:
<ul>
<li>The SAR is an active instrument.   That is to say, it generates its own
illumination of the scene to be viewed, in the manner of a camera with flash.
The satellite's illumination is coherent: i.e. all the light in any flash is
exactly in phase, in the manner of a laser, so it does not simply disperse
over the distance between the satellite and the Earth's surface.
A SAR instrument can measure both intensity and phase of the reflected
light, resulting not only in a high sensitivity to texture,
but also in some three-dimensional capabilities.   Experiments with the
technique of <i>Interferometry</i> (measuring phase differences in
exactly aligned images of the same ground area) have shown that SAR
can accurately model relief, and appears able also to detect small
changes over time.  A paper describing the technique and experiments is
available at <a href=http://gds.esrin.esa.it/A0x0000001c>
http://gds.esrin.esa.it/A0x0000001c</a>.<p>
Some consequences of being an active instrument (and using coherent light) are:
<ul>
<li>Works equally day or night
<li>Polarised - can be used to gain additional information (esp. when
different polarisations are available on the same platform - as on
the most recent Shuttle missions).
<li>Needs a lot more power than passive sensors, and can therefore only
operate intermittently.
<li>Suffers from speckle, an artifact of interference patterns in coherent
light, sensitive to texture.
</ul><p>
<li>SAR is <i>Radar</i> - i.e. it uses microwave frequency radiation.
<i>(note that in consequence, references to "light" above should
more strictly read "microwave radiation").</i>
Microwave radiation penetrates cloud and haze, so SAR views the Earth's
surface (land and sea) in all weather.   For general purpose Remote Sensing,
this is probably <i>the</i> major advantage of SAR.<p>
An example of its use is the ESA/Eurimage "Earthwatch" programme, producing
imagery of natural and other disasters when weather conditions prevent other
forms of surveillence.   Earthwatch imagery is available at

</ul>
<a name=SAR-USES><h4>What are SAR images good for ?</h4></a>
<i>this wants a better entry - else I'll just point to a bibliography
on the Net</i>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive to texture: good for vegetation studies.
<li>Ocean waves, winds, currents.
<li>Seismic Activity
<li>Moisture content
</ul>
<a name=SAR-COLOUR><h4>What is the meaning of colour in a SAR image?</h4></a>
Of course, all SAR image colour is false colour: the notion of true colour
is meaningless in the context of invisible microvawe radiation.<p>
Most SAR images are monochrome.   However, multiple images of the same scene
taken at different times may be superimposed, to generate false-colour
multitemporal images.   Colour in these images signifies changes in the scene,
which may arise due to a whole host of factors, such as moisture content or
crop growth on land, or wind and wave conditions at sea.   SAR is
particularly well-suited to this technique, due to the absence of cloud cover.
<p>The shuttle SAR's images are the nearest to 'natural' colour, in the sense
that they are viewing three different wavelengths, which can be mapped to
RGB for pseudo-naturalistic display purposes (essentially the same as false
colour in optical/IR imagery).<p>
