<B>Annex 12 -- Metal Hydrides</B>
<P>
The objectives of this International Energy Agency annex are to develop 
new hydride 
materials suitable for on-board hydrogen storage for vehicles, to develop 
new hydride surface 
treatments for a new generation of electrochemical applications, and to 
identify spin-off 
applications.  The lack of convenient, cost-effective storage devices for 
hydrogen is a major 
limitation to the wider use of hydrogen energy systems.  It has been 
difficult to develop a storage device that meets all these criteria:  it 
uses a minimal amount of energy, it is compact, and it does not add 
excessive weight to the vehicle.  Metal hydrides are a promising approach 
to storing hydrogen for both mobile and stationary systems that could 
satisfy these criteria.
<P>
This annex includes all aspects of investigating and developing metal 
hydrides for 
hydrogen storage and transportation.  Collaborative work includes 
laboratory research to 
synthesize and characterize new hydride materials and surfaces, 
evaluation of the 
manufacturability of such systems, and identification of potential 
applications.
<P>
Participating countries include Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and 
the United 
States (Operating Agent).

<I>Recent Activities</I>:
<P>
An informal working group meeting was held in conjunction with the Gordon 

Research Conference on Metal Hydrogen Systems (Henniker, NH) on July 
17-18, 1995.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the annex work 
plan and reach general agreement on it.  A technical workshop was held in 
Kjeller, Norway, on September 27-28, 1995.  Participants were from Japan, 
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.

<H2>The Hydride Properties Database</H2>
<p>
</body>
The Hydride Properties Database  is now available on the World Wide Web.  
Funded by the
U.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Program in support of the 
International Energy Agency
Annex 12 project on metal hydrides, this free database is the first of 
four databases that will
eventually make up Sandia National Laboratories' on-line Hydrogen 
Information Center.  The
Hydride Properties Database was created to make basic property data 
available to those interested in utilizing hydrides or beginning research 
in this area.  Structured to allow on-line searches, the database 
includes numerous hydriding elements, alloys, and intermetallic 
compounds.  Properties covered include tabulations of basic pressure, 
composition, and temperature (PCT) data.  Values of enthalpy and entropy 
changes are included, allowing users to calculate PCT thermodynamic 
conditions.  Also included are metallurgy and synthesis, activation, 
kinetics, cyclic stability, morphology, and gas impurity effects.  
Commercial suppliers, applications, and references for further reading 
are also part of the database.  The Internet address is <a
