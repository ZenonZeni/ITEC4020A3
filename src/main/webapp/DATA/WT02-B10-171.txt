The Clinical Psychology department has remained active in several areas of research. A major focus is the investigation of optimal treatments for childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Major Depressive Disorders in Adolescents</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1994, we initiated a placebo-controlled investigation of the efficacy of standard antidepressants in adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder. Adolescent depression has been shown to be related to the adult form of the disorder in many ways: it predicts the occurrence of depression in adulthood, and it is associated with a family history of depression in adult relatives. Yet, several small studies have failed to document that its response to treatment follows the pattern observed in adult Major Depression. To remedy the limitations of small-sample studies, a group of researchers from several university centers have launched a large scale study of a tricyclic drug, imipramine, and a serotonergic agent, paroxetine. The study will provide the first powerful test of antidepressant efficacy in depressed adolescents.

<B>Conduct Disorders in Children and Adolescents</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1993, we completed a treatment study of children and adolescents with conduct disorders, comparing lithium and methylphenidate to a placebo. We found a striking positive outcome in methylphenidate-treated children. However, significant family and social problems continued in many cases. In 1994, we developed a comprehensive treatment program to address the diverse serious problems experienced by young people with conduct disorders. An ambitious one-year-long treatment package was developed. It includes family interventions, teaching of parental management, and medication. It is currently being put to the test in a controlled design. This multi-treatment approach to one of the most challenging problems in child mental health is the first of its kind.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In tandem with efforts to reverse conduct disorders, we have designed a program, headed by Laurie Miller, Ph.D., that attempts to prevent the development of conduct disorders. Toddlers, at high risk for the development of antisocial behavior, participate with their caretakers in a two-year program that optimizes conditions in the home. The program is designed to minimize the development of the early onset of child behavior problems which are known to be strongly predictive of later antisocial behavior. This work has continued during 1993, under the sponsorship of Barbara Jonas and the Lowenstein Foundation.

<B>Risks for Mental Disturbance in Offspring of Adults with Mental Disorders</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our interest in identifying risks for mental disturbance that may occur in young children due to mental disorders in their parents has led us to initiate a study of the offspring of adults who had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in their own childhood. This study, initiated in 1994, will contribute to our knowledge of the inter-generational transmission of a very common and disabling childhood disorder. It will also potentially provide the basis for refined genetic studies, as well as prevention studies, by enabling the identification of characteristics in young children that are related to a parental history of ADHD.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We are examining as well, the children of adults with anxiety disorders in order to provide understanding of the risks conferred to children from a variety of parental psychopathology. The diversity of our high-risk research will generate important information about the specificity of possible disadvantages associated with different mental disorders in families.

<B>Collaborative Research Activities</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department has a close collaboration with the Department of Child Psychiatry through joint research activities in the Child Psychiatry Clinical Research Center (CPCRC), which is dedicated to the study of depression, anxiety, and suicidality in children and adolescents. The department directs the Clinical Core of the CPCRC, through which established investigators and research fellows conduct studies that span the neuropsychology of adolescent major depression, the psychobiology of child and adolescent anxiety disorders, early temperamental characteristics in offspring of adults with panic disorder, interpersonal psychotherapy of adolescent major depression, the psychopathology and treatment of selective mutism, and the neurobiology of adolescent suicidality.
