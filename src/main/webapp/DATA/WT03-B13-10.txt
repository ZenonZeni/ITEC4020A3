INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES REFLECT ON 1995, LOOK AHEAD TO 1996

     More than a decade ago, a revolutionary service in communications
was born:  cellular.  The cellular industry has come a long way,
changing and growing along the way.  And as 1996 begins, many are
reflecting on the impact 1995 has had on the industry and what the new
year may hold for cellular--domestically, internationally and
technologically.  Several issues raised in 1995 will continue to
affect the industry in 1996.  Instead of rehashing bygone issues of
MPN, we will let a few industry insiders reflect on 1995 and what the
new year has in store for the wireless industry.

  ...From a National Brand Point of View

     "The lesson we learned [in 1995] was the same we have learned--
and learned from--the past 11 years:  Start with your customers," said
Cellular One Group Executive Director Richard Lyons.
     "Looking forward, the new year holds one promise:  exciting
change.  The telecommunications industry will continue its
metamorphosis--the evolution of the telecommunications revolution. 
From the brand perspective, such as Cellular One's, that means that
even in the presence of the immense amount of change that drives the
industry, the key challenge will be to not lose touch with our current
customers and to anticipate the needs of our potential subscribers.
     "In looking at the issues facing the cellular industry as the new
year begins, one stands out:  the need for the cellular industry to
solidify and expand its positioning in the larger telecommunications
marketplace.  This is a direct result of the increased competition
that will occur from the introduction of new wireless technologies,
such as PCS, as well as the entrance of new players into the wireless
industry.  In 1996, the competition could become even more fierce when
Congress passes the telecommunications bill.  Consequently, in 1996,
Cellular One will look at broadening its product and service
offerings.
     "This increase in competition has made the strength of a brand
name more important than ever before.  Consumers have strong brand
preferences and make purchasing decisions daily based on the strength
of a brand name."

  ...From a Resale Point of View

     National Wireless Resellers Association Executive Director David
Gusky predicts resellers will profit in 1996 if 1995 is any
indication.  "[Last year] was a good year for wireless resale in that
more and more companies seeking to enter the wireless marketplace saw
resale as a legitimate means of market entry.
"Nineteen ninety-six should see this trend continue, especially when
you consider the changes in store for the industry.  As an increasing
number of PCS carriers, both broadband and narrowband, open for
business, creating greater competition and network capacity, the stage
will be set for a real boon in wireless resale. Competition will drive
down prices and shrink profit margins, meaning carriers will be
looking for efficient, low-cost distribution channels.  This
situation, together with the excess network capacity that is bound to
occur as PCS carriers build out their systems to comply with FCC
timetables, will prompt carriers to turn to resellers in increasing
numbers to distribute their products and services.  Resale today
accounts for just 3 percent of total revenues in the cellular
marketplace.  When you consider that long-distance resellers account
for 10 percent of their industry's revenues, or more than three times
the market share of their wireless counterparts, and that the wireless
industry will soon take on characteristics of the long-distance
industry in terms of competition and network capacity, we expect good
things to happen in wireless resale in 1996 and for a good many years
to come."

  ...From a Software Solutions Point of View

     Eric Johnson, president and CEO of Coral Systems Inc., had this
to say about the year ahead.  "We will see in the United States, the
emergence of competition into the whole wireless industry.  In the
past, we had the luxury of being able to focus on subscriber
acquisition in a duopoly environment. ...  [In 1996], we will see a
whole different tier of users ..., which will change the way the
wireless industry does business. ...  We're not just cellular anymore. 
We're a wireless industry comprised of many different standards. 
[Nineteen ninety five tells us that] wireless carriers need to focus
on customers."
     Internationally, global system for mobile communications (GSM)
operators are going through the same problems analog carriers in the
United States went through in the early stages of cellular, he said. 
But they are "close to having the majority of them solved.  I think we
will see a dramatic increase in GSM in 1996.  We'll see similar things
with CDMA [code division multiple access].
     "I'd like to say we'll have a resolution between the standards,
but there will probably be a further entrenchment [of differences]. 
Ericsson will be very aggressive in promoting time division multiple
access (TDMA) and GSM.  Competition among infrastructure providers
will increase.  We may see those who have announced what standard they
are going with, reversing [their choices]."
     He said it is unlikely dual-mode phones will pair CDMA, GSM and
TDMA, but rather each of those standards will be paired with analog. 
"Analog will emerge as the common unifier amongst [all the digital
standards]."
     Reflecting on trends that emerged in 1995, Johnson said, "I think
that there has been an enormous increase in fraud awareness."  He
described it as one
of those problems that has always been around, but now that
competition is
becoming more serious, carriers are paying more attention to the
issue.  Also, he said 1995 saw widespread acceptance of selecting a
fraud strategy or platform.  A platform of different fraud solutions
allows carriers to put unrelenting pressure on criminals, which is the
most effective strategy.
     Another trend to emerge in 1995 was the formation of national
alliances.  PCS PrimeCo L.P. Johnson said is a significant example
because it shows how the industry has "reached a phase where your
enemies become your friends."
     What does 1996 hold for Coral Systems?  "We will be announcing
some large strategic relationships early this year that show our
strategic vision, which is basically to give carriers the tools they
need to manage their businesses."

  ...From a Domestic Services Point of View

     In looking at 1995 and the future, Comcast Cellular
Communications Inc. President Don Harris reflected on the industry's
beginnings.  "When the industry first got started, cellular--although
a tremendous advancement in and of itself--was fairly primitive by
today's standards.  Phones were bulky and very expensive.  There was
no such thing as value-added features and services, and carriers
offered relatively few choices for customers.  Today, cellular has
become an incredibly sophisticated industry, offering customers a
dazzling array of equipment and feature options, and more choices than
ever before. ...  With 30 million subscribers and more than 10 percent
national penetration, [the cellular industry] is a classic American
success story."
     "Now, there are as many descriptions of what this wireless future
will look like as there are pundits who observe this industry.  From
our perspective, though, the future is all about being able to respond
to virtually every customer segment with wireless solutions that
enhance productivity and make people's lives easier and more
convenient," Harris said.  "We are emerging as a single-source
provider of wired, wireless and [TV] program content to customers here
in the United States and around the world."

  ...From an International Services Point of View

     According to AirTouch International President and CEO Arun Sarin,
highlights of 1995 included the launch of AirTouch cellular service in
Italy, Spain and India, expansion of its presence in Japan through
several joint ventures, opening of a European headquarters and in the
third quarter of 1995, growth of its international subscriber base by
130 percent compared with the third quarter of 1994.  Looking ahead to
1996, Sarin said he expects AirTouch to bid for licenses in Poland,
the Czech Republic, Brazil, Taiwan and possibly China.  Also, he
expects AirTouch to increase profitability of its operations in Asia
and Europe as well as launch services in South Korea, India and Japan.

  ...From a Technology Point of View

     TDMA Forum Project Manager John McQueen says TDMA is still the
best kept secret in digital cellular.  The Forum grew from 14 to 44
members in 1995 without any formal promotion, McQueen said.  "We have
built the most thorough protocol conformance specification, software
and test procedures to ensure full operability and functionality of
IS-136 mobiles."
     Also in 1995, the Forum uncovered and solved a major analog
compatibility problem that would have kept almost 4 million analog
phones from working on digital networks, and it began discussions on
merging IS-136 and GSM standards.  In 1996, the forum plans major IS-
136 deployments in the first quarter, and will launch an Internet web
site, sign up new members and improve TDMA functionality.

FCC PROPOSES `BILL AND KEEP' FOR CMRS-LEC CONNECTIONS

     To speed competition in both the wireless and local exchange
service markets, the FCC proposed at its December meeting an interim
"bill-and-keep" compensation plan for interconnection of commercial
mobile radio service (CMRS) and local exchange carrier (LEC) networks. 
In initiating CC Docket No. 95-185, the commission also tentatively
concluded that information about CMRS-LEC interconnection arrangements
should be made public, and it is seeking comments on whether to
require tariffs, public disclosure reports or some other alternative
to private contracts.
     For CMRS-LEC interconnection through dedicated transmission
facilities, the commission proposed a compensation plan based on
existing flat-rate access charges for similar facilities.  The FCC
further proposed that CMRS providers be allowed to recover access
charges from interexchange carriers in the same manner the LECs do. 
     Telcos generally have opposed bill-and-keep compensation for
interconnection with any type of competitor--wireline or wireless. 
Under a bill-and-keep system, each service provider terminates the
other carrier's traffic without imposing an interconnection charge. 
The LECs contend that they will be terminating significantly more
outside carrier calls than will other carriers.  
     Commissioners wanted to hear about other types of compensation
plans, but they generally seemed convinced that bill-and-keep was the
best interim choice because of its ease in administration and the
relatively small market share of wireless competitors.  Chairman Reed
Hundt said those proposing another compensation method should "think
hard about the economics and relative market powers of incumbents that
control wireline networks."
     The notice also seeks views on the FCC's jurisdiction in setting
interconnection polices affecting intrastate terminating traffic.

Industry Responds To FCC Proposal

     Soon after the FCC announced its bill-and-keep proposal, Comcast
Corp. President Brian Roberts released a statement applauding the FCC
for its actions.  "[The proposal] may be the single biggest step the
FCC has taken so far to promote local telephone competition," he said. 
"This proposal could make wireless an economically viable way to
compete for all customers."
     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association President Thomas
Wheeler also released a statement favoring the proposal.  "The wire-
less industry commends the FCC for its action today, which will lead
to greater competition in the local telephone market and lower charges
to customers. ...  In 1994, wireless customers paid LECs more than
$800 million to terminate their calls.  Such a fee can only act to
impede development of wireless as a competitive local exchange ser-
vice.  Reciprocal Termination is the solution to this anti-competitive
inequity, as the FCC has wisely proposed."

FCC Simplifies Radio License Application

     At a brown bag luncheon in December, FCC Wireless
Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) Chief Michele Farquhar said she has
approved a simplified, one-page version of Form 600, which is used to
apply for mobile radio licenses.  Farquhar said the Office of
Management and Budget has 120 days to approve the Form 600 EZ before
it can be made available to applicants.  Judy Dunlap, chief of the
FCC's Data Services Branch, said that up to 85 percent of applicants
should be able to use the new form.  In January, the commission also
will begin accepting Form 600 electronically.
     In other FCC news, former Commercial Wireless Division Chief
Rosalind Allen is now associate bureau chief.  David Furth, formerly
deputy chief, will become acting chief of that division.  Larry Atlas
and Daniel Phythyon, formerly associate bureau chiefs, will move to
the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) to work with former WTB Chief Regina
Keeney, who now heads the CCB.  Coming from the CCB, Karen Brinkman
will join the WTB this month to assist with local competition issues. 
Farquhar also expressed interest in creating a new division
specializing in public safety issues.

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA OUTPACES OTHER REGIONS, STUDY SAYS

     The cellular subscriber base of Latin America will reach 22
million by 2000, according to Pyramid Research Inc.  Its report,
"Cellular and PCS Markets in Latin America and the Caribbean,"
projects an annual growth rate of 40 percent between 1995 and 2000.
     The report claims that subscriber growth is outpacing all other
regions.  That surge is driven by tremendous growth in Brazil and
Colombia as well as continued growth in Mexico, Argentina and
Venezuela.  Privatization is racing through the region; non-basic
services including cellular are the first markets to open up, followed
closely by basic services markets, the study said.  Argentina, Chile,
Mexico, Peru and Venezuela have witnessed total privatization of their
telecom sectors.  To illustrate the penetration of competition into
these markets, the study takes note of how many competitors there are
in each.  Chile has four separate mobile phone operators, Colombia and
Argentina each have six and Mexico has 10.  In Central America (aside
from Mexico), where competitors are fewer, granting cellular operator
licenses is a top priority for governments.
     Operators serving Colombia were surprised by the demand, the
study said.  In the first nine months of operations of the cellular
networks in the country, subscribership totalled 150,000, which is
nearly half of what the operators had predicted Colombia would have in
five years.  Venezuela also was greeted with more demand than
expected, so much so that government officials are considering
licensing a third operator and speeding up the buildout of personal
communications service (PCS) networks.
     Demand is high even in markets that are not yet privatized.  For
example, in Brazil, where state-owned companies still maintain a
monopoly, the number of subscribers grew by an average of 283 percent
between 1991 and 1995.
     Why is demand so high?  Cellular often serves as a solution to
public networks unable to meet demand for telecom services. 
"Backlogged demand for basic service and heightened competition have
contributed to strong growth in the region's cellular markets," said
report author Linda Barrabee, a senior analyst at Pyramid Research. 
This demand also will benefit equipment vendors. Between 1995 and
2000, the market for cellular and PCS infrastructure is expected to
grow from $1.5 billion to $3.7 billion.  Digital equipment will
dominate in the equipment market for the region.  Revenue for digital
is expected to grow from $87 million in 1995 to more than $2.7 billion
in 2000.
     Proponents of time division multiple access (TDMA) and code
division multiple access (CDMA) technologies are battling for market
share as the region moves closer to a migration from analog to digital
networks.  Many countries have selected TDMA because it was available
first, but some of the larger markets--including Argentina, Brazil and
Mexico--have delayed their decisions until the next generation of the
TDMA and CDMA standards are available.  "Many of the larger markets
are serving as test-beds for a range of digital cellular ... standards
such as TDMA, CDMA, E[nhanced]-TDMA, and the GSM-based standard DCS-
1900," Barrabee said.  The migration to digital is inevitable because
the current demand for service cannot be met by analog systems.
     The total number of PCS subscribers will be 4 million by 2000. 
But Barrabee says that "cellular operators should not be threatened by
PCS operators in the short-term.  The window of opportunity is far
from closed.  After all, with or without PCS, by the year 2000, Brazil
will log on 9 million cellular subscribers, Argentina will top 2
million and Mexico will surpass 4 million."

COURT EXCUSES WTR's CARLO AND RESEARCH FIRM AS DEFENDANTS IN CANCER
LAWSUIT

      On Dec. 18, George Carlo, chairman of Wireless Technology
Research LLC (WTR), and the research firm he heads, Health and
Environmental Sciences Group Ltd. (HES Group), were dismissed as
defendants in a lawsuit alleging cellular telephones cause brain
cancer.  Motorola Inc., WTR (formerly known as the Scientific Advisory
Group), the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
and CTIA Senior Vice President-Public Affairs Ron Nessen are the
remaining defendants in the suit (MPN, March 13, 1995, pages 1-2). 
The judge is expected to deliver a written opinion deciding the matter
this month (January).
     Last March, plaintiff Debbra Wright alleged that use of cellular
phones had caused her benign brain tumor and that the defendants had
conspired to withhold information from the public about the alleged
connection between cellular phones and brain tumors.  The lawsuit,
filed with the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., is Debbra Wright v.
Motorola.  As a real estate manager for Bell Atlantic Mobile, Wright
said she used cellular phones from one to six hours per day between
February 1988 and March 1994.
     "[On Dec. 18] Illinois Judge Paddy McNamara ruled that even
though Wright had obtained a vast amount of information in the last
year about Dr. Carlo, HES Group and the scientific program that Dr.
Carlo is leading, she had not come forward with any evidence that Dr.
Carlo and HES Group were involved in the alleged conspiracy," said
James Baller, chief litigation counsel to Carlo, the HES Group and WTR
in the case.
     "Judge McNamara also is expected to rule in March 1996 on similar
charges [filed] by Wright in September directed specifically against
the independent scientific organization WTR," Baller said in a
statement.  "WTR believes that these allegations should also be
dismissed by Judge McNamara as they are based on the same key factual
issues the judge has now resolved.
     "WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wasteful
attacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of the
research necessary to answer the public's questions ... and that these
tactics could themselves pose threats to public health if they delay
implementation of any interventions that may prove necessary," Baller
said.
     "CTIA and the others have also filed a motion to dismiss and that
should be heard sometime early in the new year," said Nessen.  "Just
as the [motions of Carlo and HES Group] one by one have been dismissed
for lack of scientific evidence, we expect the court will also dismiss
this case."
