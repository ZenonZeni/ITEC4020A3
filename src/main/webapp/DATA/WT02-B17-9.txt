<strong>HScan/AHP Decision Analysis;<br>

S. Mack, Principal Investigator,<br>
Energetics, Incorporated</strong>

<P>

In the coming years, one or more high-value projects will be

funded by the Hydrogen Program to field-test hydrogen

technologies that are at advanced stages of development.

These projects will be selected through a competitive

proposal evaluation process.  Because of the significant

scope and funding levels of projects at these development

phases, a formal proposal evaluation process was devised to

ensure that supported projects are implemented by capable

investigative teams and that they will advance programmatic

objectives.  To meet this need, a proposal evaluation

method called HScan/AHP was developed.  HScan is a two-part

survey instrument that elicits detailed information from

proposers concerning potential risks and benefits of their

projects.  HScan also provides the reviewer with an

evaluation mechanism.

<P>

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an evaluation

technique that allows the decision maker to define important

criteria and then structure the criteria into a decision

framework.  The criteria weights and the relative rankings

of candidate alternatives are derived in a special paired-comparison 

process.  In the HScan/AHP exercise, the evaluation 

criteria are factors that must be considered in

selecting projects to fund.  These criteria include

technical, market, financial, and other factors.  The HScan

and AHP components of the process are linked by building

those evaluation criteria into their structures.  A

completed HScan provides a concise information source for

evaluating proposals using the decision model generated with

the AHP.

<P>

This work began during the 1995 planning year.  At that

time, a coordinated effort was made to generate an initial

HScan/AHP prototype that represented the Program's decision

environment in selecting a proposal for advanced technical

validation.  A baseline HScan survey was developed.  A

prototype AHP evaluation model was constructed using Expert

Choice&#174; decision support software.  Both the HScan and the

AHP components were configured using evaluation criteria

defined in an interview process.

<P>

During the past year, an HScan/AHP prototype was fully

developed and implemented.  The prototype was tested using

two unsolicited proposals for projects at the technical

validation stage.  The proposer section of the HScan was

sent to the proposing teams for completion.  After those

sections were returned, they were submitted to two reviewers

for evaluation using an HScan/AHP package supplied to them.

To perform the evaluations, the reviewers first completed

their HScan sections based on the information supplied by

the proposers.  The proposals were then evaluated and ranked

using the predefined AHP decision model.  The reviewers used

special evaluation forms to make the AHP comparisons.

Completed HScan/AHP packages were returned to the

development team.  Both the proposers and the reviewers were

able to complete the HScan/AHP sections with minimal

assistance.
