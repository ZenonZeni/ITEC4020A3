<H3>GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT</H3>
<P>
<B>-A  Multipurpose Natural Antibiotic</B>
<P>
One of the most versatile and non-toxic germ killers known to
medicine might be lurking in one of our most familiar citrus fruits,
the grapefruit. In 1964, Florida physician Jacob Harich, M.D.,
discovered that an extract prepared from the ground seeds and
membranous material of the grapefruit had remarkable, quick-acting
effects against infections inside the body and on the skin, ears,
and in the mouth.
<P>
The product was originally marketed as Citricidal and in the years
since its discovery, grapefruit seed extract has been tested and
validated by the FDA, USDA, the Pasteur Institute in France, and
numerous physicians.
<P>
The list of its applications is long and impressive. Grapefruit
seed extract works as a multipurpose germ killer, or natural antibiotic,
for bacterial and viral problems in the intestines, against yeast
infections (Candida albicans), mild to moderate internal parasitic
infestations, dysentery, as a vaginal douche, for skin cuts and
scrapes, gingivitis, strep and sore throat, ear infections, nail
fungus, dandruff, sore gums, stomach upsets, wart removal, as
a nasal spray, gum cleanser, or foot powder against athlete's
foot.
<P>
You can disinfect vegetables and fruits that may have been sprayed
with pesticides or mildly contaminated with microbes by washing
them in a grapefruit seed extract rinse.
<P>
You can use the product to help rid your body of parasites (See
<A HREF="i07-a08.shtml">&quot;Parasites-Unwelcome Visitors in Your Body&quot; 
<I>
Prescribing-for Yourself, 
</I></A> and in combination with the herbs
Echinacea and goldenseal, where it enhances their effects. Grapefruit
seed extract is excellent to support the weakened immune system
of people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or AIDS, where it acts
as a natural, gentle antibiotic.
<P>
When the FDA tested grapefruit seed extract in 1990 with 200 patients
who had internal parasitic infections, they found it gave &quot;more
symptomatic relief than any other treatment.&quot; Researchers
at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil found the substance to
be &quot;100% effective in skin disinfection when used as a pre-surgical
preparation compared to a 72% effectiveness rate for alcohol.&quot;
Physicians in Monterrey, Mexico, found that out of 20 patients
with vaginal yeast infection, 15 had relief of their symptoms
in only 3 days after douching with grapefruit seed extract every
12 hours. Doctors also report that the citrus extract, when used
topically,  can inactivate the Herpes virus after only 10 minutes
of exposure.
<P>
Grapefruit seed extract is strong and concentrated, so a little
goes a long way. The product is non-toxic and produces no side-effects.
Approximately 3-5% of people will be sensitive to the substance
and may not be able to tolerate its acidity. There are different
strengths and preparations of Grapefruit seed extract according
to application.
<P>
<B>
Grapefruit Seed Extract is available as ProSeed&#153; as  Liquid
Concentrate, Vegicaps&reg; (vegetarian capsules), Feminine Rinse,
Ear Drops, Gum Cleanser, Herbal Cleansing Spray, and Foot Powder.
A similar line called Seed-a-Sept<FONT SIZE=-2>[TM]</FONT>, is formulated for physicians.

<H3>COENZYME Q10</H3>
<P>
<B>-Life Insurance for Your Heart</B>
<P> 
Although coenzyme Q10 is present in many foods (such as rice and
wheat bran) and although the body can make it from the raw materials
in foods, many serious health conditions have now been linked
to a shortage of CoQ10 in the body's nutritional stocks. On the
positive side, taking CoQ10 supplements has been proven to help
in conditions such as heart disease, gum infections, breast cancer,
hypertension, diabetes, and a weakened immune system.
<P>
CoQ10 is a natural chemical substance essential to the generation
of energy in the cells. It's called a &quot;coenzyme&quot; because
it enhances the activity of other enzymes. It was discovered by
an American researcher in 1957 and soon after shown to be effective
in treating heart conditions. While CoQ10 is not yet generally
prescribed by physicians in the U.S., in Japan it is among the
most widely used of drugs.
<P>
In one study, 17 patients with mild congestive heart failure took
30 mg per day of CoQ10; after 4 weeks, every patient had improved
and 53% had become symptom-free. CoQ10 kept 38% of 641 patients
from requiring hospitalization for the same condition; they took
CoQ10 at the rate of 150 mg per day for 1 year. 
<P>
Patients with angina pectoris who took 150 mg per day for 4 weeks
had a 53% reduction in chest pain episodes. After 12 weeks on
CoQ10, patients with cardiomyopathy (lesions on the heart muscle)
enjoyed increased strength in their heart beat and less shortness
of breath. Patients undergoing heart surgery who took CoQ10 14
days before and 30 days after surgery recovered faster and with
less complications.
<P><A NAME="blood"> </A>
In other studies, CoQ10 lowered blood pressure significantly in
4-12 weeks. Episodes of pulmonary edema, in which fluid builds
up in the lungs, were reduced by 60%, using CoQ10. When diabetics
took CoQ10 at the rate of 120 mg per day, their blood sugars dropped
by 20-30%. CoQ10 can actually reverse peridontal or gum disease.
As with diabetics, people suffering from gum disease typically
are deficient in CoQ10. Dosages of 50-75 mg per day can halt the
deterioration of gums, sometimes within days. 
<P>
In studies reported by Dr. Karl Folkers, M.D., formerly of  Merck
Laboratories and now retired, breast cancer patients who took
300-400 mg daily of CoQ10 found their tumors completely regressed.
<P>
European studies (1994) by K. Lockwood, M.D., S. Moesgaard, M.D.,
and Karl Folkers, M.D., indicate that for 32 breast cancer patients
taking 90 mg per day of CoQ10, after 24 months, all were still
alive and 6 had partial remissions; in all cases, the tumor size
had stabilized. Then one of these patients took 390 mg per day
and within 3 months her tumor had disappeared. When a new breast
cancer patient took 300 mg per day, after 3 months, all traces
of her cancer were gone.
<P>
CoQ10 can also protect your heart against the damaging effects
of certain cancer drugs. Also, if you happen to be taking these
to lower cholesterol, this can dangerously lower body levels of
CoQ10.
<P>
Animal studies have shown that even at high doses, CoQ10 has no
toxic side effects and is safe as a nutritional supplement. Generally
it takes 4-8 weeks for CoQ10 to build up a peak concentration
in the body and to produce noticeable effects. CoQ10 is best absorbed
as a supplement when it's prepared dissolved in oil rather than
as a powdered capsule; in fact, one of the leading authorities
on the substance states that the body cannot absorb CoQ10 unless
it is made fat soluble. Chewable wafers of CoQ10, combined with
fatty acids, are available and work well.

<H3>SUPER-ANTIOXIDANT FROM GRAPE SEEDS</H3>
<P>
<B>-The &quot;Youth Nutrient&quot;</B>
<P>
One of our most powerful antioxidants was discovered in 1534 when
Canadian natives showed French explorer Jacques Cartier how to
make a nourishing tea from pine tree bark and needles. Even though
these substances had little vitamin C, somehow the brew kept Cartier's
crew from dying of scurvy.
<P>
The mysterious life-saving ingredient in pine tree bark is now
known as a bioflavonoid, a component of vitamin C. In the 1940s,
Dr. Jacques Masquelier gave this compound a special name, pycnogenol
(pronounced pick-NAH-gen-all) and began explaining how the pine
bark extract could scavenge free radicals in the body even better
than the &quot;experts,&quot; vitamins C and E. 
<P>
A free radical is a chemical compound, usually an unstable  form
of oxygen, derived from radiation, toxic chemicals, air pollution,
overly processed foods, and other contaminants, that damages cells
in the body, degrades collagen, affects DNA, and is implicated
in more than 60 diseases. An antioxidant is a substance that renders
free radicals inactive. Most alternative medicine physicians recommend
a daily intake of antioxidants, usually as vitamins C and E, to
maintain good health.
<P>
Pycnogenols have been shown to be up to 50 times more effective
than vitamin E and 20 times stronger than vitamin C in this work.
That's why many researchers contend that pycnogenols might be
the most powerful antioxidant yet discovered. European scientists
call it the &quot;youth nutrient&quot; because it helps slow cell
mutation and keep collagen (the fibrous part of connective tissue)
healthy and flexible. A British scientist calls pycnogenols the
&quot;arteriosclerosis antidote&quot; because it helps maintain
the integrity of arteries while enhancing circulation.
<P>
Then in 1986, Dr. Masquelier found that grape seeds produce an
<I>
even better 
</I>
pycnogenol antioxidant than pine tree bark.
<P>
Grape seed extract is now widely prescribed in France and Italy,
which also happen to be abundant in grapes. Doctors prescribe
grape seed for improving blood flow to the brain and heart, treating
varicose veins, skin discoloration at the extremities, such as
the nose, tingling in the extremities, bleeding gums, glaucoma,
hemorrhoids, excessive menstrual bleeding, and hardening of the
arteries.
<P>
How much should you take? Consult your physician for a precise
prescription, but researchers suggest a dosage in the range of
200-300 mg a day for 5-10 days to saturate the body tissues, then
to follow this with a maintenance dose of 60-150 mg. The substance
is absorbed almost immediately by the body (in about 20 minutes)
and produces no side effects.

<HR><A NAME="BARK"> </A>
<H3>A CANCER MEDICINE FROM THE BARK OF A BRAZILIAN TREE</H3>
<P>
An herbal extract made from the inner bark of the Tabebuia tree,
found in Brazil, Argentina, and India, may offer yet another option
in treating cancer. First discovered in 1966, by Argentine botanist
Dr. Theodor Meyer, the herb now widely known as pau d'arco has
shown promise in helping to regress cancer tumors, especially
when used in the disease's earliest stages.
<P>
Although scientists explain that pau d'arco's main active ingredient
is a substance called lapachol, in fact the herb has at least
12 aromatic compounds that, acting together, produce its positive
effects with cancer, leukemia, in addition to colds, flus, syphilis,
malaria, infections, gonorrhea, and one kind of lupus.
<P>
Back in 1970, the National Cancer Institute used pau d'arco in
a provisional study with lesions in a breast cancer case. At the
time, NCI concluded that pau d'arco was possibily toxic for humans
because it could produce nausea and blood-coagulating effects,
but later research proved that this herb is no more toxic than
coffee, which is to say, it is essentially nontoxic at moderate
dosages.
<P>
In recent years, isolated studies have suggested that pau d'arco
can help reverse leukemia, restoring dangerously low blood counts
of platelets and erythrocytes.  Meanwhile, South American physicians
report dramatic cases of tumors shrinking, pain diminishing, and
hopeless cancer cases going into remission, thanks to pau d'arco.
A study at the University of Recife in Brazil reported that out
of 9 patients taking oral doses of lapachol for 20-60 days, 3
had a partial or complete tumor regression.
<P>
In another case, a man with severe leukemia, after a month of
unsuccessful chemotherapy, took a combination formula of Essiac
(a patented multiherb blend) and 10 drops of pau d'arco extract
twice every day. After one week of this program, his blood count
had risen from 4800 to 10,800; after another week, it had further
climbed to 14,000 (10,000 is normal). Shortly afterwards, the
man left with his family on a  4 month world cruise.
<P>
CAUTION! 
Pau d'arco is available as a dried herb or liquid extract.
There is some concern in the herb market as to quality and counterfeit
(made from other trees) or inferior grades of the herb, so be
discriminating when making your selection.
