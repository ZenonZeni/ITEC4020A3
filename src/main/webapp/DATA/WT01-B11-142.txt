<H2>Trap-Vaccinate-Release (TVR) Program 
</H2>
</CENTER>


<B>What is the TVR program?</B><P>

The TVR program is a preventive measure to protect raccoons in certain areas of the province against the spread of the raccoon strain of rabies.  The program is active in the Niagara Peninsula between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal and in the vicinity of bridge border crossings along the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Iroquois, Prescott and Gananoque.<P>

<B>Why is it necessary?</B><P>

It is necessary because of the approach of raccoon rabies from the United States.  Raccoon rabies is a strain of rabies carried primarily by raccoons.  At present, this strain is not found in Ontario but has been confirmed in raccoons, on the New York state side of the Niagara River and close to the St. Lawrence River near Gananoque.<P>

<B>How does the program work?</B><P>

With the assistance of local trappers hired for their expertise, Ministry of Natural Resources staff set out live-trap cages to catch raccoons without harming them.  The raccoons are then vaccinated against rabies, marked with ear-tags that will identify them as vaccinated, and released unharmed at the site where they were captured.<P>

In 1995, the program vaccinated 72.5 per cent of the raccoon population in the buffer zones in the Niagara Region and along the St. Lawrence River.  Trapping will continue this year, from June to November.<P>

Vaccinating a large number of raccoons in these areas against rabies will contain or slow the spread of the disease, should it move into Ontario along natural routes.<P>

<B>Where are traps placed?</B><P>

The traps are placed by Ministry of Natural Resources staff in any area that raccoons are known to inhabit, including private land.  The public can expect to see wildlife technicians setting cages and checking them within 24 hours for raccoons.<P>

<B>What happens if other animals, such as pets, are caught in the traps?</B><P>

Although other animals may inadvertently be caught, they cannot be harmed by the traps.  The cages are checked within 24 hours and any other animals will be released.  The public should not attempt to release any animal from these cages.<P>
