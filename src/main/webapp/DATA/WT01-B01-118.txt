Democratization, while heralded by Africa's citizens and supported by Western governments, brought 
unexpected and often painfully familiar conditions for the press in 1995. Few leaders 
appeared willing to tolerate the free speech they promised fellow citizens on the 
campaign trail. As governments rushed to take pre-emptive steps before upcoming elections, 
draconian press laws were introduced, laws CPJ is carefully monitoring and protesting. 
The one bright spot in 1995 was South Africa, which has shown remarkable progress 
and encouraged democratic reform and free speech throughout the region.<BR>
<BR>
Crackdowns on the press were particularly harsh in Zambia, the Gambia and other countries 
with upcoming presidential and legislative elections. Many of the incumbents, former 
one-party rulers or military dictators, effectively outlawed free speech through the use of colonial-era sedition laws and criminal libel laws that make "insulting 
or offending" the president or other government officials offenses punishable by 
prolonged imprisonment. Foreign correspondents and journalists working for state-owned 
media were also targeted for perceived unfavorable coverage. For the benefit of donor 
nations in the West that are prone to criticize undemocratic methods, governments 
use the courtroom, rather than brute force, to curtail freedom of expression and 
to intimidate the press. In Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the judiciary is so compromised that 
it rarely decides in favor of the press despite the fact that press freedom is guaranteed 
by the constitution. And in the Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, military regimes simply enact decrees to override judicial verdicts they deem unfavorable to the 
state.<BR>
<BR>
Nigeria's position as Africa's most populous and oil-rich nation lends particular 
significance to the actions of Gen. Sani Abacha's brutal regime. Abacha's systematic 
and unrelenting attack on members of the press and proponents of democracy escalated 
in 1995, with a chilling effect on the Nigerian people. The secret military trials for 
treason of journalists Christine Anyanwu, Ben Charles Obi, Kunle Ajibade and George 
Mbah; the executions of nine Ogoni human rights activists, including the writer Ken 
Saro-Wiwa; and the continued imprisonment of President-elect Moshood Abiola and thousands 
of pro-democracy campaigners and human rights workers ushered in a new era of political 
repression that threatens to erupt into full-scale civil war. CPJ is working closely with Lagos-based journalists and has started a campaign to keep the endangered 
Nigerian press in the international spotlight.<BR>
<BR>
Rwanda and Burundi continued to be the most dangerous places on the African continent 
for journalists to work. Targeted by the government, the military and citizens for 
perceived ethnic alliances past and present, some journalists fled into exile. "Hate 
radio" was still used to incite ethnic violence, and government's attempts to shut 
it down proved futile. To counterbalance its effects, alternate broadcasting facilities 
have been created to provide information that is more ethnically neutral to refugees 
throughout the region.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast media remain state owned throughout most of Africa, and governments show 
no signs of relinquishing their control of the airwaves. Because of high illiteracy 
rates, low incomes in high-inflation economies and large numbers of citizens living 
in the countryside, radio is still the most effective medium for reaching the majority 
of the continent's population.<BR>
<BR>
Economic factors--such as skyrocketing printing costs, the scarcity of advertising 
and the high cost of libel suits, fines and other forms of state harassment--continue 
to deter the growth of pluralism in the press.<BR>
<BR>
The events of 1995 have left the press at an unwelcome crossroads. The coming year 
will determine whether Africa's independent press backtracks to its earlier position 
of compromise, or whether it continues to fight for true freedom of expression. <BR>

<H5>SPECIAL REPORT</H5>

<A NAME="Nigeria"><H2>The Retreat of Nigeria's Press: </H2></A>
<H3>Tactical Withdrawal or Temporary Defeat?</H3></H2>
by a Special Correspondent to CPJ<BR>
<BR>
The Nigerian independent press is in deep crisis. Famous as the most vibrant on the African continent, Nigeria's 
independent media--especially its scrappy private press--is in retreat. A sanguine 
view is that this is a tactical withdrawal in the face of a particularly brutish 
military regime, and that the independent press will outlast Gen. Sani Abacha. Perhaps, but 
there are serious questions concerning the viability of the press and its relevance 
to the body politic.<BR>
<BR>
In a 136-year history, the Nigerian news media have evolved from endorsing the colonial 
missionary catechism through the spirited advocacy of the struggle for independence 
and moved on to its post-independence mission, defining its role within the state.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1960, the press has been asserting its relevance to the evolution of the Nigerian 
state, although for 25 of those 35 years it has operated under the malevolence of 
increasingly repressive military regimes. Its vital tradition of lively reportage, 
remarkable on the African continent, was nurtured within a political culture that tolerated 
dissent, especially as a mechanism for balancing the various ethnic and political 
forces battling for the center of the Nigerian state. This center, then and now, 
remains the federal government of Nigeria. Structured as a 30-state federation, Nigeria's 
de facto mechanism of governance remains integrated into a unitary structure. This 
arrangement endows the federal government, and therefore whoever heads it, with virtually complete control of the Nigerian state--and unfettered access to its treasury.<BR>
<BR>
The Nigerian news media--especially privately owned presses--have also been subject 
to the government's pull. Atop the pile, for now, sits Gen. Abacha, buoyed by the 
two million barrels of oil produced daily.<BR>
<BR>
But it is to his immediate predecessor, Gen. Babangida, under whom Abacha served as 
head of the army for nearly a decade, that credit must go for the systematic assault 
on the press. Babangida's regime appropriated and centralized an unprecedented measure of executive powers, weakening the existing counterweights of civil society. The 
regime systematically stripped the judiciary of its effectiveness, appropriated all 
legislative functions and neutralized virtually all organized dissent by the political 
class with the tantalizing promise of elections and the full restoration of democracy.<BR>
<BR>
The Nigerian media, in their classic role as public watchdogs and instrument of checks 
against the government's excesses, were particularly targeted by Babangida. In a 
sophisticated carrot-and-stick strategy, the government co-opted senior members of 
the media, corrupted many, coerced others and terrified some--driving scores into exile. 
<BR>
<BR>
It was under this regime that a top editor, Dele Giwa, was assassinated by a letter 
bomb in March 1986 and various publications were proscribed by executive fiat. In 
1993, in the aftermath of Babangida's nullification of the June 12 elections, the 
Nigerian news media's sustained campaign helped lead to the coup that unseated him. <BR>
<BR>
Babangida's successor, Abacha, takes a more ham-fisted approach to muzzling the press. 
This era may be the last for the generals, and his regime's survival depends on strategically 
silencing the last organized domestic opposition to military rule.<BR>
<BR>
Until today, conflicts between the media and the state were resolved through backdoor 
negotiations and/or judicial intervention. Although many journalists have been fined 
and, in a few instances, jailed for plying their craft in defiance of military regimes, social pressures have historically limited the degree to which the state could 
be punitive. Potential flash points were defused through the mediation of the Nigerian 
Union of Journalists (whose members include both government and independent press), 
as well as a handful of quasi-autonomous guilds and councils that regulated the media.<BR>
<BR>
This relationship between the government and the media, already badly frayed by the 
Babangida era, was obliterated in March 1995 when four journalists--Christine Anyanwu, 
publisher and editor in chief of <CITE>The Sunday Magazine;</CITE>
 Ben Charles Obi, editor of <CITE>Weekend Classique;</CITE>
 Kunle Ajibade, editor in chief of <CITE>TheNEWS; </CITE>
and George Mbah, assistant editor of <CITE>Tell </CITE>
magazine--were among 42 people (mostly military personnel) arrested and charged with 
attempting to stage a military coup against the Abacha government. The four were 
tried before a secret military tribunal and sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment. 
Several prominent human rights and civil rights activists were also arrested and charged 
with participating in plotting the coup. They might well have been executed if national 
and international groups had not pressured the junta to commute their sentences. The Abacha regime, in its crude attempt at instituting a totalitarian order, has 
finally drawn the press into its vortex.<BR>
<BR>
This unprecedented infringement on the rights of civilians is the current military 
dictatorship's desperate attempt to secure its own survival by employing the full 
resources of the Nigerian government. But even the Abacha regime is not omnipotent. 
In today's exquisite political balancing act, the sentences of the journalists imprisoned 
for allegedly plotting the coup were reduced from life imprisonment or 25 years to 
15 years. And in his October Independence Day address, Gen. Abacha removed the ban 
on the Punch Group and the Concord Group, two prominent news media chains that were put 
out of circulation for more than a year. A third, the Guardian Group, was unbanned 
in July only after its owners were forced to offer a personal apology to Abacha himself.<BR>
<BR>
Last November, seeming to defy world opinion, the regime executed the author and television 
producer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni human rights activists. But, with these 
acts, it was clearly playing to a domestic gallery--attempting to reassert control after backing down by commuting the sentences of those who allegedly plotted the 
coup.<BR>
<BR>
As the Abacha regime attempts to exercise control of the Nigerian polity, it is occasionally 
forced to retreat by the press, other remaining pockets of civil opposition and the 
uneven pressure of international sanctions. But the military blunders on.<BR>
<BR>
During Christmas week, State Security Service agents arrested Nosa Igiebor, editor 
in chief of <CITE>Tell </CITE>
magazine, Nigeria's leading newsweekly. (Igiebor was the recipient of the Committee 
to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 1993.) The agents also 
confiscated 55,000 copies of the magazine and forced its managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, into hiding. In a related incident, the office of the recently unbanned <CITE>The Guardian </CITE>
was attacked and torched by men armed with machine guns. <CITE>Tell </CITE>
magazine released a statement shortly after the arrests and attacks saying, "State 
terrorism and acts of brutal intimidation will not force us to compromise our belief 
in freedom, justice and the rule of law." This might well be the battle cry of the 
Nigerian news media.<BR>
<BR>
While the responsibility of the media to the polity remains clear, their ability to 
function effectively has been seriously compromised. In the best of times, the many 
structural inadequacies of the system were mitigated by the intellectual brilliance 
and commitment of a corps of top-notch journalists that kept the national debate lively 
and engaging. During the last decade, however, an entire generation of journalists 
fled Nigeria, alongside the country's best and brightest professionals in every field. 
Those who chose to remain behind, like Dapo Olorunyomi, editor in chief of <CITE>TheNEWS, </CITE>
and Nosa Igiebor, in addition to facing off the military, must contend with a depleting 
stock of experienced and well-trained journalists.<BR>
<BR>
The rejuvenation of the press as an element of civil society is tied to the overall 
need to reinvent a democratic post-Abacha Nigeria, and hence a postmilitary era. 
The gradual erosion of democratic structures over a quarter-century of military misrule, 
cascading into an avalanche under this present regime, is the prevailing reason for 
the Nigerian news media's retreat. But the media's current position may be a tactical 
withdrawal: The Abacha regime has been forced to announce plans for a transition 
to democracy, but the full implementation of those plans might be well beyond this government's 
control and tenure.<BR>
