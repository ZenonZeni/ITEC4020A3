<H2><A NAME=child><B>Child Labor Around the World</B>



</A>


</H2><P>






<P><B>Recently your Mom or Dad bought you a new soccer ball. There is a good









chance that the ball was made by someone younger than yourself. Fully half
of the soccer balls sold in the United States are made in Pakistan, and every
one of those soccer balls had an assist from a child under 14 who toils 10
hours a day in subhuman sweatshops, stitching the ball or cutting material
used to make it.</B>






<P><B>This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children worldwide,












some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production line.
Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India, Pakistan,












Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human rights
abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children between the ages of
10 and 14. </B>






<P><B>These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugs
and countless other products that are flooding the American market and driving












hard-working Americans out of jobs. More than 60 years ago the United States












banned child labor, sweatshops, long workdays and workweeks. But now we are












subsidizing, encouraging and failing to criticize the enslavement of young
people in the Third World. </B>






<P><B>Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much that they
buy
them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or for the settlement












of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only four years
old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young son for
less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving loom most
of the time, tying tiny knots 10 hours a day. </B>






<P><B>Carpetmakers like the young weavers because their tiny fingers can
make
very tight knots, and also because they are cheap to own and maintain. Masih
was a free person by the age of 12 and crusaded against the horrors of child












labor. In November 1994 Iqbal spoke out on the abysmal conditions in the
sweat shops of Pakistan at the international labor conference in Stockholm,












Sweden. The next month, he was given a Youth Action award in Boston. Shockingly,












in March 1995 he was shot and killed in his village in Pakistan while riding
his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman of the Bonded Labor Front, a group fighting












child labor, said, "We know his death was a conspiracy by the carpet mafia."









</B>






<P><B>Only a boycott by the United States and other nations will have any
impact
on slave-based industries like the rug manufacturers. Nike similarly bases
its operations on finding the lowest-cost labor to make its athletic shoes.












Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian sweatshops 70 hours a week making
Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of glue. Blue jeans and cheap clothing
made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves of American shops like K-Mart and












Wal-Mart.The United States needs to take a leadership role in eradicating
child labor around the globe. </B>






<P><B>Child labor is a human rights issue. What is more of a human right
than



growing up a free person, attending school without being shackled to medieval












machinery? Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label that
says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia, that
a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed his
or her labor to that product.Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't buy












clothing and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator,












Congressman and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest
abuse of human rights: child labor. </B>

<P><B><A NAME=cause>What is the Children Against Underage Servitude and


Employment





</A>(C.A.U.S.E.) ?</B>






</H2><P>






<P><B>C.A.U.S.E. is a group of American children who are opposed to the












exploitation
of children in Third World countries. We believe that children should be
in school, not in factories. We believe that poor countries can only escape
from their poverty by education of their children. Child labor only continues
the cycle of poverty.</B>






<P><B>The basic premise of C.A.U.S.E. is that strong and effective action



must
be taken to reduce child labor around the world.</B>
