Primary Care Substance Abuse Training Gives Plans
Chances for Quick Payback


Arming primary care physicians with the tools to
diagnose substance abuse is one example of how quality improvement
initiatives actually lower costs.

Better substance abuse training in primary care physician residency
programs could improve dismal diagnosis rates, a panel of
clinicians and health administrators recommends.
But managed care organizations shouldn't leave the job to graduate
medical education, one health plan administrator urges. Taking the
lead in educating primary care physicians on substance abuse
treatment can help health plans achieve a substantial and quick
return on their investments.
Arming primary care physicians with the tools to diagnose substance
abuse is one example of how quality improvement initiatives
actually lower costs, says Dr. John Ludden, senior vice president
for medical affairs at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of Brookline,
Mass. "The patient feels better, the PCPs' lives are made more
organized, the cost picture is better, and the employer wins."
And substance abuse patients can be treated with greater success
rates than people with many other chronic illnesses, says A. Thomas
McLellan, professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania.
The competency model recommended by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation
offers health plans a starting point for education efforts, Ludden
adds. "Those are things that ought to be expected of PCPs in
currently functioning organizations."
Ludden and McLellan were members of a panel of 45 physicians,
employers, academics, public officials and administrators that
composed the list of competencies that primary care physicians
should learn in residency programs.
Substance abuse education historically has been at the bottom of
managed care organizations' list of priorities, but that could
change rapidly.
"What forces this up the priority list, especially in integrated
MCOs that do behavioral health, is that it's one of those few
situations where everyone wins," Ludden says.
And enhancing a health plan's ability to identify and treat
substance abuse patients will pay back quickly, probably in 18
months or less, Ludden argues. "It's one of the very clear areas
where employers understand the payback," he says. "They don't have
to be sold that anymore."

Among the primary care physician competencies recommended by the
foundation:

o        Screening patients for alcohol and
drug abuse;
o        Using office-based therapy,
including brief intervention techniques, counseling and
pharmacotherapy;
o        Referral to specialized treatment
and other community programs;
o        Care of affected family members; and
o        Recognizing and assisting colleagues
with substance abuse problems.

Contact Joe Sutherland of the Macy Foundation at (301) 652-1558,
and Ludden at (617) 730-4746.

Managed Medicaid Plan's Providers Contend Program
Owes Them Millions


About 65 mental health agencies in Massachusetts may
sue a Medicaid managed mental health contractor for $6 million to
$9 million in unpaid claims, saying a billing catch-22 deprived
them  of the money.

A managed behavioral health firm has found itself caught under
attack from providers who want payment for services rendered under
the Massachusetts managed mental health program.
The providers may sue the state's Medicaid managed mental health
care contractor, Mental Health Management of America, for breach of
contract over $6 million to $9 million in allegedly unpaid claims.
The state has promised to make sure money owed providers is paid.
The providers say the contractor trapped them in a catch-22 to
avoid paying claims for mental health and substance abuse
treatment. The contractor required that claims be submitted within
90 days of service and include preauthorization numbers, then
allegedly didn't furnish the numbers promptly enough for the
providers to meet the deadline.
"Claims processing was not [Mental Health Management's] strength,"
acknowledges Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the state Division for
Medical Assistance, which oversees Medicaid. For example, there was
a problem with a claims backlog.
"We'll make sure [Mental Health Management] is resonsible for
complying with the contract," Bullen says. "But it doesn't mean
we'll pay all claims."
He noted that Mental Health Management "performed in a superior
fashion in some areas, like quality management."
John Kahn, a lawyer representing 65 mental health agencies
allegedly owed money by Mental Health Management,
agreed that quality of care wasn't at issue.
But Massachusetts canceled Mental Health Management's Medicaid
managed care contract. The company's parent, First Health Services,
did not have its contract to run New Mexico's certified Medicaid
management system renewed in 1994.
Mental Health Management of America, owned by First Financial
Management of Atlanta, got the Massachusetts managed care contract
for mental health and substance abuse treatment in 1992.
In a letter to a Mental Health Management outside lawyer, Kahn asks
the contractor to process the providers' unpaid claims and suspend
troublesome edits related to prior approval, billing within 90
days, a 365-day payment appeals process and claims identification
numbers.
Kahn says Mental Health Management hasn't met providers' demands
yet, but the two sides are scheduled to meet next week. 
At press time, Mental Health Management had not granted a request
for comment to MBH.
Mental Health Management broke new ground in providing
comprehensive managed mental health care to Medicaid, so there were
growing pains, says Ron Preston, HCFA associate regional
administrator. But that's not why Mental Health Management's
contract wasn't renewed past June. "Other applicants had more solid
applications," Preston says. Massachusetts Behavioral Health
Partners won the bid.
Under the contract with Massachusetts, Mental Health Management was
paid $11.5 million in admini- strative expenses under a
risk-bearing contract that allowed it to make up to $750,000 if it
kept expenses in line or shell out up to $750,000 if it went over
budget. The first 92 cents of every dollar saved went to the state,
and the remaining 8 cents to Mental Health  Management.

Plan Builds Disorder Pathway As Cue for Patients,
Providers


Confronting a relatively uncharted illness, a health
network used its experience with past pathways to shape guidelines
for treatment of dissociative identity disorder.

Starting from scratch, Presbyterian Behavioral Health Network of
Albuquerque, N.M., has designed a clinical pathway to guide
patients with dissociative identity disorder and the providers who
treat them down a standard route.
"With DID, there were no models and no clinical studies to work
from," explains Selene Mahaffey, quality improvement specialist at
Presbyterian. But Albuquerque's intensely competitive managed care
environment puts a premium on controlling inpatient length of stay
and proving treatment value.
So Presbyterian built a DID pathway from the ground up, drawing
from experiences that it gained in crafting protocols for bipolar
disorder and alcohol  detoxification.

Among lessons learned during those earlier efforts:

o        Work very closely as a team when
creating treatment guidelines.
o        Come to a consensus on what
constitutes effective treatment.
o        Dig up the latest research on a
target illness, concentrating especially on controlled clinical
studies.
o        Communicate constantly with staff
members, making sure they understand the goals of the path and how
to use it.

Presbyterian kept the pathway design group small and focused,
including only two outpatient therapists, two physicians, an
inpatient mental health therapist and a quality improvement
specialist. The pathway came together in four 90-minute meetings.

Complexity Keeps Goals Focused

In tackling DID, the Presbyterian pathway creators confronted a
complex illness: Anxiety, depression and sleeplessness all are
involved, and a large number of DID patients also have substance
abuse problems.
The group settled on several goals, including lengths of stay of no
more than seven days and keeping patients from harming themselves
in medically serious ways. Dealing with past memory was deemed too
difficult to achieve in a seven-day stay.
Without a trail of clinical studies, the clinical judgment of
nurses and physicians continues to play a large role in a patient's
treatment, though the DID guideline identifies situations when
patients should be taken off the path.
The pathway rests in Presbyterian's existing computer system, and
standard order sets programmed into the network allow charge nurses
to move patients along the path without having physicians sign off
every time. That's been a hit with the nursing staff, Mahaffey
says: "They feel there's plenty of room for their professional
input."
The pathway is also becoming a motivational tool for DID patients.
"Most of them like that it's very concrete - they know what the
goals are and what's going to happen every day," she says.
The price tag for the pathway: A minimal consulting fee of less
than $500 for the outpatient therapist's time. Using the existing
computer system and doing planning work during regular staff hours
cost Presbyterian nothing.
Presbyterian's DID pathway has run into several serious obstacles,
Mahaffey admits. "We had people who didn't believe in it as a
disorder opposed to providers who specialize in it," she explains.
And the lack of clinical studies stymied efforts to standardize
drug treatment.
"If we had the studies to fall back on, that would help handle the
physicians who are more creative in their prescriptions," Mahaffey
says. "We had to be honest about the differences in opinion and
focus on the things we could agree on."

Breast Cancer Study Could Give Carve-Out Plans the Blues


Investigators hope to show that integrating mental and
medical health services will improve breast cancer treatment
outcomes.

A two-year clinical investigation uniting the American
Psychological Assn. and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts
could be good news for cancer patients but bad news for the managed
behavioral health carve-out concept.
The study's hypothesis: Integrating mental and medical health
services would improve outcomes for women with breast cancer and
save payers money.
The first of 120 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer will
enter the study within the next two months. Those patients will
then participate in a 16-week group managed psychological
intervention program conducted by Massachusetts Blues mental health
providers.
Mental health services won't be integrated into the medical
treatment program of a comparison group of cancer patients.
Instead, the group will follow the "existing standard of care," the
study's creators explain, accessing psychological services on their
own from a list of behavioral health resources.
Investigators will track immunological functioning, long-term
cancer recurrence and mortality within the two groups. Preliminary
results could come as early as this year.
The association expects those results will clearly demonstrate that
the early integration of psychological services into medical
treatment will improve clinical outcomes. That could give
scientific backing to the APA's argument that integrated delivery
systems should bring psychological services back into their menu of
primary and specialty medical services.
For information, call Jan Peterson of APA at (202) 336-5898, and
Susan Leahy of the Massachusetts Blues at (617) 832-4823.

Little-Fish CompCare Deals Could Trigger More Mergers


The refurbished national specialty care company has big
dreams for public sector mental health business, and that could
mean fewer independent players by year-end.

On the heels of recent acquisitions of two regional managed
behavioral health companies, relatively unknown Comprehensive Care
Corp. has nationwide ambitions in public sector managed mental
health care - ambitions that could accelerate consolidation in the
managed behavioral health arena.
After nearly dropping completely from market screens in the early
1990s with a failed push into hospital ownership and tax troubles
with federal authorities, Costa Mesa, Calif.-based CompCare
reshuffled top leadership and restructured operations. CompCare has
targeted $2 billion in business in 1996, and acquisitions will be
crucial to success.
Late last year, CompCare's managed behavioral care subsidiary,
Comprehensive Behavioral Care, purchased Health Management Services
of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The acquisition brought 350,000 covered
lives in the Midwest to CompCare, boosting total managed behavioral
care membership to 1.25 million, up from 400,000 a year earlier.
This month, CompCare bought Philadelphia-based Mustard Seed, adding
140,000 public sector covered lives in Pennsylvania to its managed
mental health division (MBH 2/8/96, p. 7).
Those moves expanded CompCare's managed behavioral care presence
out of the West and the South, and came on top of deals last fall
with HIP Health Plan of Pennsylvania and PCA Health Plans in Puerto
Rico.
The Mustard Seed deal strengthens CompCare's position at the
doorstep of the New Jersey/New York public sector mental health
market. The company is reportedly eyeing a large piece of public
sector business in the metropolitan New York region.

Mustard Seed, HMS Won't Be Last to Go

But industry observers wonder if the Medicaid managed mental health
care pool is large enough for yet another national player.
"[CompCare's] growth isn't going to disrupt the structure of the
market," says Dr. Michael Freeman, president of the Portola Valley,
Calif.-based Institute for Behavioral Healthcare. "They're just one
of several very focused organizations" in a market that will
continue to grow for several years.
Comprehensive Behavioral Care's numbers don't approach the more
than 15 million lives of Park Ridge, N.J.-based Merit Behavioral
Care Corp., for instance, or the 20 million lives covered by Value
Behavioral Health of Falls Church, Va.
Nevertheless, "There's an attitude [among the largest managed
behavioral health firms] of, 'We don't know who these people are,
but we're going to keep an eye on them,'" says Suzanne Gelber,
president of SGR Health and a senior research fellow at Brandeis
University's Institute for Health Policy. "They kind of came out of
nowhere."
Mustard Seed won't be the last of the managed behavioral health
care market's smaller players to look for larger friends, industry
observers predict.
"The small guys just have limited access to larger contracts,"
explains Mustard Seed Vice President for Business Development
Robert Bailey.
CompCare CEO Chriss Street concurs. "The mental health market tends
to be very fractured, with lots of 'mom and pop' providers," Street
says. "As the bar gets raised, those providers are going to be
ground out or bought out."
Among smaller fish mentioned by some observers as potential
takeover targets: Vista Health Plans of San Diego, with 470,000
covered lives.
But new acquisitions may not top the priority lists of big players
such as Value Behavioral Health and Magellan Health Services, which
are still digesting  previous purchases. 
"They now have to integrate their acquisitions, and that takes time
and effort," Freeman said.
For more details, call Matt Lepo for CompCare at (818) 789-9000,
Bailey at (215) 836-3205, Freeman at (415) 435-9821, and Gelber at
(203) 761-0860.

Group Captures Patient Views Using Electronic System


A computer-based patient functional assessment tool gave
a behavioral health group practice a window into its own operations
and greater stature with payers.

Using an electronic functional assessment tool, an Albuquerque,
N.M., mental health group practice pairs clinicians' observations
with comprehensive patient-generated information - and the
combination has attracted the notice of payers.
In the past, pencil and paper were Mesa Mental Health's standard
tools for capturing patient perceptions of service quality,
explains Gayle Zieman, chief clinical officer. Patient views on
their functional levels slipped by completely, leaving clinician
notes as the only word on functional status.
Standardized measures were nonexistent.
BEHAVIORisk, an electronic assessment tool created by Response
Healthcare Information Management of East Greenwich, R.I., changed
that. Using a survey instrument that the behavioral health
organization chooses, patients fill out a bubble-sheet
questionnaire, which is scanned into the organization's information
system.
Mesa's customized survey questions cover a range of issues,
including patient satisfaction, symptoms, functional levels and
even perceptions of physical health.
What Mesa providers found surprised them, Zieman says. Most new
patients expected their treatment would last less than 10 sessions,
lower than Mesa's  estimate.
The system also covers areas providers had often overlooked. "Some
of our clinicians never asked about chemical dependency," he says. 
The electronic patient survey does ask about chemical dependency,
alerting providers when the condition could be present.
The system's selling points: BEHAVIORisk uses Microsoft's Access
database, software Mesa already had licensed. An open-architecture
design allows the group practice to customize the software.
The creation of a central database proved most attractive, Zieman
says. "The ability to export our data into an aggregate pool is
very important."
Response is building a national data warehouse for patient
satisfaction information, functional improvement data and outcomes
measures. 
The database cuts across care divisions, gathering information from
HMOs, group practices and hospitals as well as behavioral health
providers.
Response eventually plans to shape performance measures from the
data.
The payoff: The ability to capture the patients' side of functional
assessment recently helped Mesa land a partnership deal with one of
Albuquerque's major behavioral health payers to track the treatment
of depression in primary care settings.
For details, call Zieman at (505) 291-5300, and James Spitzer of
Response at (401) 885-6900.

HHS Rejects Medicaid Waiver For Mental Health-Only Plan


Montana may yet land a waiver for a com- prehensive
Medicaid managed care plan  that includes a special focus on
managed mental health.

While HHS recently shot down Montana's plans for a Medicaid managed
mental health care-only demonstration, state officials say a less
ambitious plan could earn a waiver by the fall.
State officials last summer asked for a Sec. 1115 Medicaid
demonstration waiver to begin the Montana Mental Health Access
Plan. The program would have moved Medicaid mental health services
into a single, statewide managed care program extending coverage to
residents with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level.
The demonstration would not have covered other health services for
newly eligible recipients.
That exclusion killed the plan's chance for a Sec. 1115 waiver, HHS
said in rejecting Montana's plan. Without a guarantee of basic
health services for the new group, HHS won't OK the project.
But HHS Secretary Donna Shalala told Gov. Marc Racicot (R) that
federal officials could fast-track an application for a Sec. 1915
waiver or a revised Sec. 1115 waiver proposal that expands services
to physical as well as mental health care.
That's sent state officials back to the drawing board. Pushing
ahead with the planned extension of mental health benefits without
federal matching funds isn't an option, says Dan Anderson,
administrator of the state's Division of Addictive and Mental
Disorders.
Alternate plans include pursuing a Sec. 1915 waiver to move current
Medicaid eligibles into a managed mental health plan and using
state funds to cover target groups such as severely mentally ill
adults and adolescents.
The state is also considering adding coverage of basic health
services for newly eligible beneficiaries to its original Sec. 1115
waiver application.
For more information, contact Anderson at  (406) 444-3969.

Consider Employer Concerns In Outcome Measure Design


Don't jump into outcomes measurement without understanding
the basics, one expert says, and always keep an eye out for
measures payers want.

Asking some basic questions before building a behavioral health
outcomes measurement system can keep an organization's efforts on
track and ensure the final product offers measures that payers will
value.
Robert Shomer, president and CEO of Encino, Calif.-based Hawthorne
Community Medical Group, cautions behavioral health organizations
to have the answers to the following questions before pushing
ahead:

o        Why are you doing this? Know your
target audience before you begin crafting an outcomes measurement
system. Is it for a report card? Will the results be used in
marketing? Does a payer want to see enrollee utilization trends?
Are you benchmarking your performance against other players?
o        Do you want to measure satisfaction
or outcomes? Know the difference, Shomer warns. Patient
satisfaction surveys are effective at uncovering needed
improvements. But the reasons why patient satisfaction levels are
down or why interventions fall flat will elude you. Outcomes
studies give behavioral health groups the power to track causality.
o        What level of precision do you want?
Greater detail can mean greater expense. For some, an inexpensive
patient satisfaction survey using postcards that patients fill out
at the office is enough.
o        Do you have the in-house talent to
build a system? If the pool of internal expertise is too shallow,
groups can turn to consultants or existing proprietary systems.
Don't dismiss a team effort with the psychiatry department of a
local university, Shomer says. They're extremely interested in the
impact of managed care, and they're more adept at real-world field
work than many behavioral care companies expect.

Move Beyond Clinical Quality Measures

Behavioral health groups shouldn't stop at clinical quality and
patient satisfaction measures. Anticipate the demands of employers,
for whom greater employee productivity on the job and stability at
home can be more important than clinical improvement, Shomer says.
Studies tracking functional status at work and within the home can
win and keep contracts.
"The therapist may be content, but for the family and the job, the
patient is just as dysfunctional," he says. "Employers aren't
interested in re-engineering employees' personalities - they want
people to be able to get back to work."
Other key information payers want: medical cost offset data. "If
you can show that you're providing lots of access, and because of
that patients don't end up in the hospital or in the primary care
physician's office inappropriately, that's extremely powerful,'
Shomer says.
For more information, contact Shomer at (818)  609-1761.

POLICY & REPORTS


       New developments in managed mental
health care will be among the topics at the Feb. 28 meeting in
Washington of the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
Subcommittee on Mental Health. The subcommittee will also discuss
new  research on alcohol abuse. Contact Gail Fisher of NCVHS at
(301) 436-7050.

       The Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration is seeking comments on its
requirement that states asking for a substance abuse prevention and
treatment block grant for 1997 report on their efforts to stop the
sale of tobacco to minors. SAMHSA estimates the additional
requirement will add only 24 hours to the application process. Send
comments to Deborah Trunzo,  SAMHSA Reports Clearance Officer,
Room 16-105, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md.
20857.

       The first formal meeting between
managed behavioral health care companies and mental health consumer
groups ended with the creation of work groups and a promise to keep
talking. Nine executives of American Managed Behavioral Healthcare
Assn. member firms met early this month with 10 representatives of
national consumer organizations in a wide-ranging, two-day
discussion. The result: Three work groups covering issues such as
consumer education and the use of practice guidelines will produce
reports on their findings. For details, call Clarke Ross of AMBHA
at (202) 434-4565.

       The Consumer Managed Care Network,
a mental health consumer advocacy group, released its "Platform for
Action," outlining the basics of a consumer-friendly managed care
system. Among planks in the six-point platform: (1) service
delivery in the least-restrictive community-based setting;  (2)
"meaningful" consumer involvement in contract development, clinical
protocols and provider credentialing; (3) prevention of
cost-shifting to public mental health systems; and (4) access to
all quality assurance measurement findings. For more information,
contact Laura Van Tosh, CMCN coordinator, at (703) 739-9333.

       A report studying the relationship
between changes in Massachusetts' public mental health care system
and client deaths found that mortality rates among patients using
Department of Mental Health inpatient, case management or
residential services declined between the beginning of 1991 and the
end of 1993. But investigators refused to link the drop in
mortality rates to changes such as managed care, citing
insufficient data. Among recommendations in "Report on
Massachusetts Department of Mental Health Service Recipient
Mortality (1991-1993)": DMH should integrate existing data on
patients treated in department inpatient, case management or
residential services; and create a comprehensive data system to
track mental health patients treated through outpatient therapy,
clubhouses or emergency services.

       Managed behavioral health care firms
could get their first peek at the National Committee for Quality
Assurance's managed behavioral health care accreditation system as
early as April. NCQA says it will release the system for industry
comment this spring. For more information, contact Claire Sharda,
assistant director of accreditation policy,  at (202) 955-3500.

       A bill allowing managed care
enrollees to see psychologists and other specialists without a
referral is moving through the Indiana legislature. State Rep. Jeff
Espich (R) is sponsoring the legislation, H.B. 1289, which would
allow specialists to treat managed care plan patients who had not
gone through plan "gatekeepers." The Indiana House passed the bill,
which has been sent to committee in the Senate. But powerful
opponents, including the state's Chamber of Commerce and the
Indiana Manufacturers Assn., have lined up against the legislation.
With the legislative session set to end in mid-March, however, the
clock, not business groups, may snuff the bill's chances this year.
Call Espich's office at (317) 232-9606.

       More than four out of five employers
offered employee assistance programs in 1995, according to a survey
of 1,050 major U.S. businesses conducted by Hewitt Associates of
Lincolnshire, Ill. In 1990, 73% of employers had EAPs in place.
Five years later, the number had jumped to 84%, with most employers
contracting with an outside provider for EAP services. Contact
Monica Gallagher of Hewitt Associates at (847) 295-5000.

Credentialing Service May Go Electronic


As early as June, managed care companies could begin
tapping into the American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Assn.'s
provider credential verification service.

The National Behavioral Healthcare Credential
Verification Service should cut the cost and effort of checking out
potential network providers by offering behavioral health plans and
providers a clearinghouse for credential verification (MBH 1/11/96,
p. 5).

The association plans to sign a contractor by March and
have the system operational three months later, says Darcy
Gruttadaro, a consultant who helped develop the program.
The service will verify a physician's license, proof of
residency program, lack of major malpractice judgments and other
documents.

Still uncertain is the cost of using the system.
Proposed charges include a fee per verification  request, annual
fees or provider recredentialing charges.

The whole process could go on-line sometime down the
road, Gruttadaro predicts, with plans, providers and the
credentialing service linking together electronically.

Contact Gruttadaro at (703) 519-8539.
