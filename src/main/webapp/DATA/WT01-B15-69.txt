A banana republic no more, we can bask in the warmth of fiscal restraint. The warm glow that comes from lower inflation, fiscal restraint, good growth and export potential. Several recent economics reports from Canadian banks point to better times ahead.<p>The Bank of Montreal (yes, I think that their "times they are a'changing" ads are great)! have issued a recent report that predicts a great year for 1997. Despite the aforementioned strong growth, Canadian industry has the excess industrial capacity to handle the expansion, without triggering higher inflation. The Bank of Montreal also expects lower interest rates from the Bank of Canada and therefore, good bond markets. The economists at Scotiabank expect that Canadian growth rates will lead the G-7 nations in 1997 and we will achieve this with one of the lowest inflation rates of all industrialized nations.<p>By the way, check out the <a href="charts/usvscdn.gif">Canandian dollar chart</a>. We're up to about 75cts.,with the potential of getting to about 78-79 cts.<p>Over the past month, Canadian sub-indices have been reflecting the World's new high opinion of Canada. My list of 48 International and domestic indices and sub-indices places 10 Canadian sub-indices in the top (12 market) quartile. The only International indices to make the top list were Madrid and Hong Kong. The best performing Canadian sub-indices for the past month are Real Estate, Financials (especially Banking), Communications, Transportation and the Oil and Gas Index. For the rest of our natural resource investments, things are much as they were last month. Paper and Forests are showing improvement after making cycle lows between March and August. Metals are dragging and Gold appears to be losing value, although it may pay investors to watch the action of bullion prices. The London Gold chart shows that gold is very oversold, as investors look at other apparently fertile fields. When an investment sector hits the bottom everybody is invariably looking elsewhere, so it might be worthwhile to post a note to keep checking on Gold bullion prices. The worst performers for the past month are Golds, Consumer Products, Metals and Industrial Products.<p>The TSE 300 is powering along at over 5700 and is really overbought. But who will stand in the path of a moving train and go against the rising tide at this point? Traders' rules say "Always go with the trend." Overbought markets can accelerate in the direction of the major trend for quite a while. All we can do is go along for the ride for the time being. Will the markets end in a crash as many of the "bears" have predicted? I'm not the one to tell you. The "bears" have been wrong to date and strong markets generally don't turn on a dime. In the "Crash of '87" the markets topped out nearly two months before October 19th and the August 28th high was about 15% above the Dow on October 19th. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/londongo.gif">London Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metal<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>95</center></body></html>
