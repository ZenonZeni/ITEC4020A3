<b>TAHITIAN FRUIT HELPS CANCER, ARTHRITIS, CHRONIC FATIGUE, PMS</b><p> 
Among the lay healers of Tahiti, the reputation of the noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia) as a medicinal food ranks high. The plant itself is found throughout French Polynesia and can grow as high as 20 feet, bearing noni fruits (pictured above) the size of potatoes. In Malaysia, it is known as Mengkudu and is used for urinary problems, coughs, and painful menstruation, while in the Caribbean, people know it as the Pain Killer Tree. People throughout the region have long used the noni fruit as a dietary staple.<p> 
Anecdotal reports suggest that juice from this fruit can be significantly helpful in numerous health conditions, such as hypertension, wounds and infections, ulcers, skin rashes, digestive disorders, colds, influenza, arthritis, and cancer. Mitchell Tate, director of the Center for Lifestyle Disease in St. George, Utah, reports using noni to prevent sore throats and bacterial infections after his family was exposed to strep infection.<p> 
Tate further reports that while researching noni at the University of Honolulu in Hawaii (noni also grows in Hawaii), he found that "a significant amount of research has been done on the plant and that most of it substantiated claims by the Tahitians."<p> 
One laboratory study showed that noni was effective as an antiseptic against 9 types of infectious bacteria; another suggested it would help lower blood pressure; and a third showed that noni produced complete remissions and increased life spans in mice injected with lung cancer. Out of 22 mice injected, 9 survived more than 50 days after receiving noni for 5 days; mice not receiving noni survived only 9-12 days.<p> 
According to principal researcher A. Hirazumi, Ph.D. (Proceedings of the Western Pharmacological Society, 1994), noni juice "seems to act indirectly by enhancing the immune system involving macrophages and/or lymphocytes [key cancer-fighting immune cells]." A Japanese research team studied the effects of 500 extracts from tropical plants in inhibiting the activity of  the K-ras-NRK cell (believed to be a cancer precursor) and found that noni performed the best (Cancer Letters, 1993). A French study (1990, published in Planta Medica) demonstrated that noni has a clinically important sedative and pain-relieving (analgesic) effect.<p>
Research by R.M. Heinicke, Ph.D., at the University of Hawaii, suggests that the active ingredient in noni is xeronine, a digestive enzyme similar to bromelain in pineapple. Dr. Heinicke emphasizes that noni must be consumed on an empty stomach, preferably upon rising in the morning, for the enzyme to become activated by the intestines.<p> 
Dr. Heinicke believes that, once activated, xeronine helps to repair damaged cells by regulating the rigidity and shape of particular proteins comprising those cells. "Since these proteins have different functions within the cells, this explains how the administration of noni juice causes a wide range of physiological responses," states Dr. Heinicke.<p>
According to testimonials published in Health News, noni juice has produced relief in individuals with arthritis, chronic fatigue, and PMS, among other conditions. John Bowers, aged 35, had suffered from ankylosing spondylitis and arthritis  for 10 years. He was disabled, only able to get around with a wheelchair or cane, in constant pain, and facing a lifetime of debilitation. Numerous conventional drug regimens and therapies failed to improve his condition over a 5-year span. Bowers states that the first night after taking noni, he slept through the night for the first time in 4 years. Taking noni at the dosage of 2 ounces daily for 2 months, his need for both cane and wheelchair was nearly eliminated and he was able to get about on his own.<p>
Colleen Abbott, aged 55, had suffered with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) for 20 years. A variety of nutritional supplements had improved her symptoms but not eliminated them. A recent accident injured her back, leaving her in pain, almost immobile, and on painkillers. Colleen reports that after taking noni for 3 days, she was able to "get up, walk, and climb stairs without crawling." Her sleep improved, her pain and most of her CFS symptoms went away, and instead of needing chiropractic adjustments twice daily, she had them only once a month.<p> 
Noni appears able to correct PMS and menstrual problems, according to Vicki Morgan. She reports that she always had severe cramps 5 days before her period and during the first few days of bleeding; although she followed a nutritional program for 6 years, her menstrual problems remained. Taking noni regularly eliminated her PMS cramping and reduced the cramping during bleeding.<p>
According to Morinda, the product's manufacturer, about 25% of the users of noni experience a noticeable difference after using the drink for 3 weeks, while 50% notice benefits after 3-8 weeks of daily use. Mitchell Tate suggests a daily dosage of 2 tablespoons for general health maintenance, but 3-4 tablespoons daily for an existing health condition.<p>

<b>GARLIC IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART<br>
Lowers Blood Pressure and Cholesterol</b><p>
While garlic has been used for centuries in traditional cultures throughout the world as a multipurpose medicinal food, in recent decades more than 2,000 clinical studies have validated many of the folk healing claims for "the stinking rose," as garlic was once called. Promi-nent among these substantiated claims is garlic's ability to lower blood pressure, inhibit cholesterol production, promote blood circulation, and discourage clot formation.<p>
In a Chinese study, 70 patients with clinically diagnosed high blood pressure took garlic oil for several weeks. At the end of the study, 35 registered a "marked" lowering of their blood pressure, while another 14 subjects experienced "moderate" drops. <p>
Garlic liquid extract that has been aged for at least 1 year appears to produce better results than fresh raw garlic. A Bulgarian study on cats showed that fresh garlic juice produced only a "slight and temporary" decrease, while aged garlic extract produced more significant and sustained drops in blood pressure. <p>
Garlic can not only lower high blood pressure, but apparently elevate low blood pressure as well, leading researchers to propose that its true effect is normalizing blood pressure. <p>
Garlic may also lower cholesterol and appears to produce this effect by slowing down the synthesis of cholesterol by the liver in the first place. In a study published in Atherosclerosis, 20 patients with elevated levels of lipoproteins (a protein-fat compound) took garlic for 4 weeks. At the end of the period, all subjects showed a 10% drop in blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Researchers studying a vegetarian community in India found that those who consumed "liberal" amounts of garlic (and onions) had an average of 25% lower cholesterol levels than those who did not. <p>
A study directed by Benjamin H.S. Lau, M.D., Ph.D., of the School of Medicine at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California, studied the effect of garlic supplementation on 32 subjects with high cholesterol. During the 6-month study, subjects took 4 capsules daily of liquid garlic extract, after which time cholesterol levels had returned to normal in 65% of the participants. More specifically, levels of HDL cholesterol (believed to protect the heart) rose steadily, while levels of LDL cholesterol (believed to harm the heart) steadily dropped. <p>
Garlic has also been shown to promote blood circulation, both peripheral (to the hands and feet) and "microcirculation" (into the tiniest capillaries). It can also interrupt the harmful tendency of the platelets and fibrin in the blood to form clots, a condition associated with heart attacks and stroke. Researchers reported in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition (October 1994) the results of a clinical study involving 45 men, aged 30-70, with high cholesterol levels. Of this group, 66% received "beneficial effects" in these levels and platelet activity after taking garlic extract at 700 mg, 9 times daily for 6 months. The result was "cardiovascular risk reduction." <p>
Yu-Yan Yeh, Ph.D., of the Department of Nutrition at Pennsylvania State University reviewed extensive multi-laboratory studies on garlic's ability to reduce cardiovascular disease and concluded: "Collectively, the results suggest that garlic may lower the risk for this disease by reducing plasma lipids, lowering blood pressure, and depressing platelet adhesion and aggregation [clotting]." <p>
According to Brenda Lynn Petesch, nutritionist with Wakunaga of America Co., Ltd., manufacturers of Kyolic® Aged Garlic Extract™, garlic can prevent the spread of smooth muscle cells in blood vessels that would otherwise further the progression of heart disease. Petesch also notes that a recent Australian study showed that garlic extract "may afford protection against the onset of atherosclerosis [hardening of the arteries]." <p>
Finally, with respect to existing heart conditions, dietary garlic may reduce the risk of having a second heart attack as well as the general risk of dying from heart disease. Over a study period of 3 years, regular use of garlic reduced the rate of repeat heart attack by 30% in the second year and by 60% in the third year based on a group of 432 subjects. Researchers proposed that garlic's benefit is cumulative, building with continuous use. <p>
