<B>Public Review of Proposed Expansion<BR>
to Wabakimi Provincial Park
</B>
</CENTER><P>




The Ministry of Natural Resources is undertaking a final public review of the boundary for its proposal to expand Wabakimi Provincial Park from 155,000 hectares to close to 900,000 hectares (ha).  Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced a final review period on December 12, 1996.<P>

Wabakimi Provincial Park is located approximately 300 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, near the community of Armstrong in Northwestern Ontario. The Ministry of Natural Resources will analyse the comments from the public review before regulating the proposed park boundary early next year.<P><BR>

<I><B>What is the public being asked to review?</B></I><P>
<B>1. Comments are requested on a specific proposal for an expanded boundary for Wabakimi Park.</B><P>
In 1992 the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) initiated a review of the original boundary of Wabakimi Provincial Park to look at the park's size, shape and representation of natural features. A proposal to expand Wabakimi was announced in April of 1995 with many details about the proposed expansion left to be worked out before the park could be regulated.<P>

These details included minor boundary adjustments and an accurate mapping of the boundary location. MNR staff have completed this work in the boundary proposal now available for public comment.  A Boundary Proposal Information Package is available that includes a map of the proposed expansion.<P><BR>


<B>2. General comments are requested regarding the permitted uses recommended for the expanded area.</B><P>
The Wabakimi Park Boundary Committee, representing local interests, recommended permitted uses for an expanded park based on ecosystem protection, recreation opportunities and maintenance of existing remote tourism activities. <P>

MNR's boundary proposal reflects the input of the committee.  Many of the current recreational and economic uses within the proposed expanded park area will continue to be permitted.  These include remote tourism, mechanized travel, hunting, trapping and bait fishing.  These are outlined in detail in the Boundary Proposal Information Package.<P>

More detailed consideration will be given to the extent and location of some permitted uses during park management planning.<P><BR>

<B>What other information is found within the final boundary proposal?</B><P>
The boundary proposal includes information on accommodating many of the current uses of the area through a unique framework of permitted uses recommended for the expanded park area.  The proposal also recommends that the expanded park area be classified as a Natural Environment Park.  The original 155,000-hectare Wabakimi Provincial Park will retain its wilderness classification.  Traditional Aboriginal uses will continue within all of the expanded park area.<P>

There is an area of 550 ha of leased mining claims near the northwestern edge of the proposed expansion.  Discussions are continuing with the primary leaseholder regarding the status and future of these claims.<P><BR>

<B>What happens after the review?</B><P>
The Minister of Natural Resources plans to proceed with park regulation after this review of the boundary proposal.  It is anticipated that regulation will occur in the spring of 1997.  Park regulation will be followed by a more detailed park management planning phase, during which additional public comments will be requested.<P>

MNR will amend the District Land-use Guidelines for Nipigon and Ignace to reflect the approved boundary and permitted uses resulting from this review.<P><BR>
<I><B>How to get the information package:</B></I><P>
