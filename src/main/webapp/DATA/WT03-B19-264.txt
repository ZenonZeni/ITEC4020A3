<title>Guide for Investors - Commonwealth Government services</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1>Commonwealth Government services</h1>
<P>
<A NAME="hdq">
<B><I>Investment promotion and regional headquartering</I></B>
<P>
The Commonwealth Government plays an active role in attracting productive investment to Australia in the manufacturing and services sectors in the interests of industry growth, employment and increased exports. The main vehicle for the promotion and recruitment of investment is the Investment Promotion Program (IPP).
<P>
The Program is administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST) in conjunction with Austrade.
<P>
Major activities under the Program involve the promotion of Australia as a location for foreign direct investment to likely investors, the provision of detailed investment briefs for both new investment and reacting to matchmaking opportunities, major project facilitation and the co-ordination of investment missions and site visits.
<P>
Most of the promotion and facilitation work within the IPP is done by Austrade, internationally through its Investment Commissioner posts in various countries, and locally through its Investment Office (Investment Australia). DIST undertakes the preparation of promotional material and policy development for the Program. The IPP is undertaken within a framework of co-operation with the promotion and facilitation activities of the States and Territories.
<P>
There are several sub-programs of the IPP that offer specific forms of assistance to prospective investors.
<P>
<I>Regional Headquarters Marketing Program</I>
<P>
This initiative, which commenced in September 1993, is designed to encourage companies to invest in Australia as a base for operations in the Asian region.
<P>
The Commonwealth Government offers various forms of assistance to companies which locate their regional headquarters (RHQs) in Australia:
<ul>
<li>certain foreign source dividends passed through a resident company to a non-resident shareholder will be exempt from dividend withholding tax (DWT);
<li>certain costs associated with the establishment of RHQs in Australia will be deductible expenses for Australian tax purposes, being costs which in most cases would otherwise be treated as capital and hence be non-deductible. Where, during establishment and early operations, a RHQ is not an operating business and therefore not a taxable entity, eligible costs will be allowed to be carried as deductions against assessable income in the following year. Also, any tax loss of an operating business will be allowed to be carried forward indefinitely, subject to current arrangements;
<li>on a case-by-case basis, the provision of a wholesale sales tax exemption for imported used computer and computer-related equipment for RHQ investment proposals; and
<li>a streamlined immigration process for RHQ employees seeking residence.
</ul>
<P>
Significant numbers of international companies have established regional headquarters in Melbourne in recent years including both large, well known and smaller firms. These have included Campbell Soups, Oracle Corporation, Dun and Bradstreet, Chiquita and Hella.
<P>
<I>Research and Development Marketing Campaign</I>
<P>
This initiative is modelled on the IPP's RHQ campaign and aims to encourage multinational companies to locate their Asia-Pacific R&D activities in Australia and to capitalise on Australia's abilities in science, innovation and leading edge information, telecommunications, multimedia and other technologies.
<P>
<I>Feasibility Study Consultancy Fund (FSCF)</I>
<P>
This fund provides support for feasibility studies to encourage new investment in value-adding, advanced manufacturing or internationally traded services. Proposals must have a minium initial capital investment of $10 million or have the support of a State or Territory Government. The Commonwealth provides funds to match those of the State or Territory up to a maximum contribution of $50,000.
<P>
<B><I>Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST)</I></B>
<P>
The Department of Industry, Science and Technology has several programs to support innovation and research and development in Australian industry. These programs are designed to strengthen the international competitiveness and export orientation of Australian business. New technologies emerging from R&D lead to the creation of innovative products and processes and the identification of market opportunities all over the world.
<P>
Programs include:
<ul>
<li>Tax Concessions for Research and Development;
<li>Competitive Grants for Research and Development;
<li>Concessional Loans for Commercialisation of Technological Innovation;
<li>Access to Export Finance;
<li>Technology Access;
<li>Advanced Manufacturing Technology.
<li>Agri-food Industries Program
</ul>
<p>
<A NAME="tinc">
<I>Tax Concessions for Research and Development</I>
<P>
A deduction of 150% is allowable for qualifying expenditure incurred on 
research and development activities carried on in Australia. 
<P>

A company's total research and development expenditure for the year must 
be greater than $20,000 to qualify for the full concession. The results of the R&D must be exploited on normal commercial terms and must benefit the Australian economy.
<P>
The concessional deduction is available to companies, partnerships of companies and to public trading trusts. To be eligible for the concession the company must be registered with the Industry Research and Development Board.
<p>
As of 6 December 1995, companies must register no later than six months after the end of the financial year in which the R&D expenditure was incurred. There will be a one-off exception period of six months from 6 December 1995 for taxpayers to register in respect of expenditure in 1993-94 to 1994-95.
<p>
Expenditure directly incurred on undertaking eligible R&D activities can be claimed. Claims should be made on an individual project basis and must be based on actual incurred expenditure. Eligible items include wages, allowances, bonuses, overtime and penalty rates, annual sick and long service leave, superannuation fund contributions, payroll tax and workers compensation premiums. Expenditure on plant, including pilot plant, used exclusively for research and development, is deductible at a rate of 150% over three years.
<P>
<I>Competitive Grants for Research and Development</I>
<P>
Companies that are eligible for the R&D tax concession as well as companies that may not currently be profitable, or have carry-forward losses which do not enable them to take full advantage of the tax concession can apply for Competitive Grants for Research and Development. Private discretionary and unit trusts (not eligible for the tax concession) can also apply. 
<P>
The maximum grant is 50% of project costs. Grants are provided on a competitive basis for:
<ul>
<li>market driven R&D in firms needing assistance, but unable to gain full financial benefit from the 150% tax concession for research and development;
<li>collaborative R&D activities, that are high risk, but could provide extensive benefit to Australia;
<li>trial and demonstration activities between technology developers and potential customers; and
<li>collaborative R&D activity between industry and research institutions.
</ul>
<P>
Projects must involve research and development or trial or demonstration of internationally competitive products, processes, systems or services, and the results of the project must be exploited for the benefit of Australia. Grants are awarded competitively to eligible projects.
<P>
<I>Concessional Loans for Commercialisation of Technological Innovation</I>
<P>
This program is available to companies incorporated in Australia, partnerships and trusts employing less than 100 persons.
<P>
Concessional loans support the early commercialisation of technological innovation of goods, systems or services. The maximum loan is 50% of project costs. Loans will be made for a maximum of three years from the date of the loan agreement, with repayment commencing after 42 months. Interest is calculated daily at 40% of the Commonwealth Bank Loan Reference Rate and will accrue three years from the date of the loan agreement.
<P>
Projects must involve early commercialisation of technological innovations for products, processes, systems or services.
<P>
Support will be limited to: product/process design; trial production runs including tooling-up costs; regulations and standards compliance; protection of core intellectual property; trial and demonstration activities; and product documentation. Loans are awarded competitively to eligible projects.
<P>
<I>Access to Export Finance</I>
<P>
The program is intended to identify sources of export finance appropriate to exporter's needs, and to help them obtain assistance in preparing proposals for export finance. Applicants will be reimbursed 50% of the costs incurred in obtaining expert advice on options for financing an export transaction and the subsequent preparation of a proposal for export finance.
<P>
Small, new exporters employing less than 30 employees who have begun exporting in the last five years and have annual export sales of $5 million or less are eligible. An exporter must first have paid an expert provider of advice for assistance in preparing a proposal for export finance, and must have lodged the proposal with an export finance provider.
<P>
<I>Technology Access Program</I>
<P>
This program is designed to facilitate the establishment of an Australian technology network to improve the manufacturing industry's access to technology and technical advice. It is readily accessible by firms at all levels, but places particular emphasis on servicing small to medium enterprises in the manufacturing sector.
<P>
Funding by way of competitive grants is made available for groups of institutions or centres to upgrade or expand their facilities and services offered to manufacturing firms.
<P>
<I>Advanced Manufacturing Technology - Investment Evaluation Guidelines</I>
<P>
This program is designed to address the detailed technology issues confronting many firms and provides a means of determining whether an investment in technology is justified. The Investment Evaluation Guidelines assist firms to focus on priorities and identify technologies which are consistent with their company's strategic objectives. They assist firms to evaluate the technical, operational and financial feasibility of the technologies.
<P>
Eligible companies can receive a subsidy through AusIndustry to assist them in meeting the costs of employing a licenced consultant to help implement the Investment Evaluation Guidelines.
<P>
<I>Agri-food Industries Program</I>
<P>
This is a joint government-industry strategy to improve the international competitiveness of the Australian processed food and other value-added food industries.
<P>
Priority areas for activity are workplace reform, trade and investment, clean food export, food quality, innovation, links between growers and processors, networking, regulatory reform, transportation, food packaging and import replacement.
<p>
<A NAME="pdf">
<B><I>Pooled Development Funds</B></I>
<P>
The Pooled Development Funds scheme assists in making equity capital available for small and medium-sized enterprises.
<P>
The scheme provides a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for special investment companies, known as Pooled Development Funds (PDFs). The sole purpose of PDFs is to provide new equity capital in Australian resident companies which have total assets of less than $50 million and are seeking funds to expand production or markets.
<P>
Dividends paid by a PDF are tax exempt in the hands of the investor. In the case of franked PDF dividends, investors may elect to include the dividends in their taxable income and so gain the benefits of the imputation system. Capital gains on the disposal by investors of PDF shares are also tax exempt.
<P>
PDFs are not permitted to borrow, except for short term liquidity purposes, nor are they allowed to buy back their own shares. They are permitted to invest up to 30% of their funds in any one enterprise, with investments being for at least 10% of the paid-up capital of an investee company.
<P>
PDFs are also prohibited from investing in retailing operations, or real estate except for tourism or manufacturing projects.
<P>
The PDF scheme started in 1992 and was slow to gain acceptance amongst the business community. Only 11 companies were registered under the scheme in the first two years. The Government, in consultation with business, made some changes that were designed to make the scheme more attractive. These changes were introduced in 1994 and in the year since, 16 additional companies have been registered making a total of 27 PDFs with about $61 million under management as at July 1995.
<P>
<B><I>Invest Australia</I></B>
<P>
<I>Infrastructure Borrowings (Develop Australia Bonds)</I>
<P>
Invest Australia, a trading name of the Development Allowance Authority, a statutory office within the Commonwealth Treasurer's portfolio, approves access to Develop Australia Bonds. The bonds extend preferred taxation status for investment in important Australian infrastructure projects. Develop Australia Bonds are a specific form of debt used to finance infrastructure projects. The term reflects the role of the bonds in the development of community infrastructure in Australia.
<P>
Invest Australia does not itself issue Develop Australia Bonds. Its role is to approve proposals that meet the Government's policy aims for provision of specific forms of private sector infrastructure.
<P>
Develop Australia Bonds is a generic term that includes bonds, debentures, discounted securities and any other form of indebtedness. There is no upper or lower limit on the size of the debt. The key benefits of the bonds are:
<ul>
<li>interest paid to lenders is tax free, or a rebate may be claimed;
<li>capital gains on disposal of securities are exempt;
<li>expenses incurred by the lender are deductible;
<li>interest paid is not deductible by the borrower; and
<li>the concession is available for up to 15 years.
</ul>
<p>
Infrastructure projects with lengthy construction periods may not produce assessable income for some years and may accumulate tax losses in the early stages of development. When taxpayers borrow to finance the construction of these projects, they are often unable to access interest deductions available to them. By making interest on Develop Australia Bonds non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower, the tax benefit of the interest deduction is transferred to the lender in the form of non-assessable interest income. This enables funds to be raised at a lower interest rate, and borrowing costs are reduced.
<P>
Specifically, Develop Australia Bonds can lower the cost of finance for private sector infrastructure projects. This is attractive, in straight price terms, to taxpayers with high marginal rates. A tax rebate of 36% is also available as an alternative to increase the attractiveness to low tax rate investors, including superannuation funds.
<p>
Key criteria for eligibility for Develop Australia Bonds are:
<ul>
<li>the infrastructure facility must be operated commercially;
<li>the public must be charged for use of the facility;
<li>the facility must be operated by the private sector, or a government body acting on a commercial basis, for 25 years after completion; and
<li>the facility must be in an eligible sector comprising water supply or treatment, sewerage and wastewater, roads, railways, seaports (wharves and docks), electricity, air transport, gas transmission, as well as necessary related facilities (e.g. rolling stock in the case of a railway).
</ul>
<p>
<B><I>Austrade</B></I>
<p>
Austrade is the agency of the Commonwealth Government responsible for international business facilitation and assisting Australian companies to expand exports. Austrade's services include:
<ul>
<li>the provision of basic information and counselling;
<li>planning, market entry/promotion activities;
<li>investment advice;
<li>the development of industry sector strategies; and
<li>export assistance.
</ul>
<p>
Austrade's overseas operations concentrate on markets with significant trade opportunities where Australian-based companies face particular problems such as language and cultural differences. North Asia and South-east Asia are of special importance. Fees are charged for most Austrade products.  
<p>
<I>Export Market Development Grants (EMDG)</I>
<p>
The EMDG scheme aims to encourage Australian exporters to seek and develop overseas markets for goods, services, intellectual property rights and industrial expertise that are substantially of Australian origin.
<P>
The scheme provides financial incentives to Australian residents in the form of taxable cash grants based on expenditure incurred for the purpose of seeking and developing overseas export markets. Eligible areas of spending include overseas market research, overseas advertising, overseas representation, participation in overseas exhibitions and fairs, bringing overseas buyers to Australia, foreign language training and export education courses. Expenditure related to trade with New Zealand is excluded.  
<p>
Grants are calculated as 50% of eligible expenditure in excess of $15,000, 
subject to a minimum eligible expenditure threshold of $30,000 with a maximum 
grant of $200,000 in any one year. A maximum of eight grants are generally 
payable to any one recipient. However, those claimants who undertake promotions 
in new markets as defined in the legislation may be eligible for an additional 
three grants for each new market entered. After grants have been received for 
two years, the maximum grant is the lesser of the amount calculated according 
to the above formula and a percentage of export earnings as shown in the 
following table:
<p>
<table WIDTH=100% border=4>
<th align=left>Year for which grant is received</th>
<th align=left>Percentage of export earnings</th><tr>
<td>3rd</td>
<td>40.0</td>
<tr>
<td>4th</td>
<td>20.0</td>
<tr>

<td>10.0</td>
<tr>
<td>6th</td>
<td>7.5</td>
<tr>
<td>7th,8th and following 'new maket' claims</td>
<td>5.0</td>
</table>
<p>
Grants are not paid to claimants with export earnings in excess of $25 million in a grant year. Affiliated companies can only receive grants where the aggregate export earnings of those companies which actually lodge claims are less than $25 million in total. However, total grants payable to members of a single group may not exceed $250,000 a year.
<P>
Claims for a particular grant year must be made within five months of the close of that grant year. However, during their first three grant years, claimants may lodge claims half yearly.
<P>
<I>Market Opportunities Unit (MOU)</I>
<P>
Products and services available under the MOU of Austrade include:
<ul>
<li>the monthly Trade Intelligence Report containing tender details and industry-specific information;
<li>the World Import Regulations Directory, a loose-leaf reference guide covering import requirements for around 115 overseas markets;
<li>the Import Regulations Unit, which handles complex enquiries regarding foreign import regulations; and
<li>TOP On-line which gives Trade Intelligence Reports subscribers electronic access to the latest information on trade opportunities from Austrade's overseas network.
</ul>
<p>
<I>Austrade loans</I>
<p>
Austrade loans provide firms, groups of firms, consortia, or industry associations with financial support for international business activities. The scheme targets financially sound firms with a successful track record in exporting which require assistance in order to expand their exports.
<P>
To be eligible for assistance, the applicant must be an Australian company, and be prepared and able to undertake at least 50% of the proposed expenditure, where minimum total activity expenditure is $150,000 over three years. The applicant's product or service must be substantially of Australian origin with potential to earn net foreign exchange earnings of at least $3 million over five years. Applicants are selected for funding on a competitive basis. Maximum funding available for any company is $5 million, and support is available for a maximum of three years. Funds are provided either as a low-interest loan or an advance attracting a royalty. The scheme also allows up to $300,000 to purchase capital equipment which is directly related to an export project. This funding is available to small and medium exporters who can demonstrate an innovative approach to export.
<P>
<I>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC)</I>
<P>
The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is Australia's official export credit agency. EFIC offers a range of export credit insurance, export finance, bonds, export working capital guarantees and overseas investment insurance facilities to Australian exporters. EFIC's primary purpose is to encourage trade and commerce with overseas countries by giving Australian exporters access to facilities comparable with those available to their foreign competitors. These include:
<p>
<I>Export Credit Insurance</I>
<P>
EFIC insures exporters of Australian goods and services against defined 
risks of non-payment for 
exports. Its Export Credit Insurance Policy suits varying export 
products, credit terms and offshore 
risks. Cover is available for the export of Australian goods and services 
on credit, leasing 
of Australian equipment to overseas hirers, non-payment of sums due from 
overseas employers for goods 
and services under construction contracts, payment guarantees to overseas 
agencies and/or an 
Australian bank financing Australian exports, letters of credit cover and 
the facility to indemnify 
Australian companies for losses related to goods stockpiled for sale 
overseas.
<p>
<I>Overseas Investment Insurance</I>
<p>
EFIC insures Australian overseas investment against the non-commercial risks of loss caused by expropriation, war and the inability to transfer monies received on, or return of, the investment.
<P>
<I>Export Finance</I>
<P>
EFIC provides a range of finance and bonding facilities to enable overseas buyers to purchase Australian capital goods, related services and stand-alone project management services. It can also finance some associated overseas costs incurred by Australian exporters.
<P>
EFIC export finance complements facilities provided by financial institutions within Australia and operates under the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>exports financed are capital goods, related services and stand-alone project management services;
<li>an eligible contract contains goods wholly or mainly produced in Australia and services wholly or mainly provided from Australia; and
<li>Australian origin is certified to EFIC by the exporter. Provided Australian content is the substantial majority of the contract, some non-Australian content can be financed.
</ul>
<p>
<I>Bonds</I>
<p>
EFIC offers Performance Bonds, Bid and Tender Bonds and Advance Payment Bonds against the provision of acceptable tangible security. An exporter may, however, apply to EFIC for support for Performance Bonds and Advance Payment Bonds on an unsecured basis, where the exporter has insufficient collateral.
<P>
Insurance cover for Unfair Calling of Bonds is also available to the exporter, for cover usually up to 95% of the face value of the insured bonds.
<P>
<I>Export Working Capital Guarantee</I>
<p>
EFIC provides Export Working Capital Guarantees. This facility has been developed to assist exporters which have an export transaction in place, or are currently negotiating an export transaction, for most goods or services but which need working capital support to complete the transaction.
EFIC will guarantee to the exporter's bank the provision of working capital to enable exporters to complete an export transaction.
