<H2>Federal Energy Management: Billions Saved, Billions More to Come</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
This report is designed to highlight the Federal government's reduced cost and increased efficiency of energy use in its buildings and facilities from Fiscal Year 1985 through Fiscal Year 1994.  It examines the investments made to create the savings, the savings achieved, and the projected savings to the year 2015. 
<P>
The Federal Energy Management
Program (FEMP) provides
this report to document one of the most successful energy management
programs in the country.  Federal energy management has been an activity of the government
since the late 1970's, when energy conservation was a necessary response to the energy crunch
brought on by the Oil Embargo of 1973&#150;74,  natural gas shortages in 1977&#150;78 and the
Iranian Hostage Crisis in 1979. Through a series of energy policy laws and executive orders, the
Federal government was mandated to become more efficient and reduce its use of petroleum.
 Under these mandates Federal energy management is a shared responsibility, met through
independent but coordinated actions of Federal agencies.  By responding to the initial energy
crises of the 1970's the Federal government discovered that energy efficiency improvement made
economic and fiscal sense&#151;that it was just good business practice.  FEMP's role is to serve
as the advocate, enabler and facilitator of Federal energy management, leading Federal agencies
to accomplish energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water conservation goals.  
<P>
The Federal government is the single largest energy consumer in
the nation, with 1.2 quadrillion Btu (quad) delivered to the point of use in Fiscal Year (FY) 1994<A HREF="#note1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.  This energy helps house and support our service men and women; fuels vehicles, aircraft, and
ships; powers government research and development; and keeps government offices lighted,
heated and cooled, allowing Federal employees to more productively perform their jobs.  There
are approximately 500,000 Federal buildings, with over 3.1 billion square feet of floor
space.  It is also probably the most diversely located set of energy uses as well&#151;covering all 50
states and overseas, and all climate zones.
<P>
Federal energy management has already achieved significant success,
with quantifiable results. Federal energy management is sound business practice; increased
energy efficiency through improved training, maintenance methods, conservation practices,
capital retrofit projects, efficient new building design and efficient product procurement
has led to reduced energy consumption and costs and increased pollution prevention, as well
as increased Federal productivity.
<P>
The accumulated savings from energy improvements in Federal buildings
and facilities, FEMP's mandated programmatic focus, was $9.8 billion through FY 1994.
 Looking ahead, consistent application of energy efficiency improvements and use of solar
and renewable energy technologies in Federal buildings is expected to result in additional
annual savings of approximately $1 billion per year by 2005 from current levels,
and an additional cumulative net savings of $15 billion by 2015.
<P>
<H3>The Record of Success&#151;Meeting the Fiscal Year 1995 Goal</H3>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=50 SRC="images/reductio.gif">
<P>
The National Energy Conservation Policy Act, Section 543, as amended
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, established the FY 1995 goal of improving energy
efficiency in Federal buildings by 10 percent from 1985 levels on a Btu per gross square foot
of floor area basis.  <STRONG><I>This goal was exceeded in FY 1994, with a total government reduction in Btu per gross square foot of floor are of 11.2 percent.</I></STRONG>  In meeting this goal the Federal agencies compiled tremendous successes in energy and cost reduction.
<P>
As part of the Federal energy management effort, the major agencies
report information on energy use and cost, as well as other relevant information, to
Congress on an annual basis<A HREF="#note2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.  This information provides a validated record of achievement.  This record runs from Fiscal Year 1980 through Fiscal Year 1994.   Preliminary results for Fiscal Year 1995 are currently being reviewed and confirmed by FEMP and the agencies.  All energy and
cost amounts in this report are based on this historical record.  Savings are calculated from
Fiscal Year 1985 levels, the base year for goal measurement specified in current legislation and
executive orders.  All dollar amounts are expressed in constant 1994 dollars.  The key results
are:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 SRC="images/costsav.gif">
<UL>
<LI>FY 1994 energy costs decreased by $1.5 billion from
1985 levels.
<LI>$9.8 billion in cumulative energy cost savings accrued
over the FY 1985 through 1994 period.
<LI>FY 1994 site energy consumption in buildings was
18.2 percent less in absolute terms than in Fiscal Year 1985.
<LI>FY 1994 Federal buildings petroleum-based fuel use
declined 45.4 percent from 1985 levels, addressing energy security goals.
<LI>Electricity consumption increased 7.7 percent from
1985 levels.
</UL>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=all>
<IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 SRC="images/invsav.gif">
The Federal government has invested taxpayer dollars to achieve
these accomplishments.  A cumulative total of $3.3 billion dollars in Federal appropriations
were invested from FY 1980 through FY 1994 for capital energy efficiency projects.  Based
on the experience of the Department of Energy In-House Energy Management Program (IHEM),
these investments can, on average, be expected to return $5 for every $1 invested, with
a 25 percent annual return on investment over a 20 year project life. <STRONG><I>Based on this experience the investment in place in FY 1994 can be reasonably expected to produce an additional $10 billion in energy cost savings through the year 2015.</I></STRONG>
<BR CLEAR=all>
<H3>Analysis of Federal Energy Cost Savings</H3>
The reported $1.5 billion reduction in Federal energy bills represents
the sum total of all changes that contributed to energy use and cost reduction in Federal buildings.
 Based on the IHEM experience, cost savings from Federal efficiency investment in
FY 1994 should have been about $5.2 billion, or about $4.6 billion less than that reported. 
In order to partially explain this difference, the energy costs savings were adjusted<A HREF="#note3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> for an observed
real energy price decline and a reduction in Federal buildings gross square footage over the
FY 1985 to FY 1994 period. 
<P>
Federal buildings energy cost reduction in FY 1994 from the 1985 baseline, as reported by Federal agencies was $1.498 billion. This annual energy cost savings is reduced by $ .181 billion to reflect real energy price decreases from 1985, and $ .067 billion to reflect decreased gross square footage in Federal buildings.  These effects represent 17 percent of the FY 1994 cost reductions resulting in net savings of $1.25 billion.
<P>
This $1.25 billion in annual savings can be attributed to investments
in efficiency projects (reported as $3.3 billion from FY 1980, the earliest reported
data, to FY 1994), and to operations and maintenance actions, and other non-investment actions that
resulted in net energy use reductions.  While energy and cost savings directly resulting
from investments are not available, cost savings in FY 1994 from the investment stream can be reasonably
estimated using the DOE IHEM experience.  Based on the Federal energy project investment stream from FY 1980 through FY 1994, approximately $ .718 billion of the $1.25 billion in energy cost savings, excluding price and gross square foot effects, can be attributed to those investments. The remaining $ .532 billion in savings can be partially attributed to operations and maintenance actions, the costs of which are not separately accounted for by agencies. 
<P>
Federal energy cost savings are also effected by two other important
factors, weather variability and change in energy utilization.  Weather variability can be
normalized through use of heating and cooling degree-days, however integrating the differences in
weather conditions at thousands of Federal sites nationwide is impractical.  It is reasonable
to assume that weather effects, when averaged over the entire nation over a ten year period, would
not have a significant effect on savings.  Federal energy utilization in buildings since FY 1985
has probably changed substantially, with office automation accelerating in the late
1980's through FY 1994.  Although not tracked, increased use of energy consuming equipment would
tend to reduce reported energy and cost savings, thus understating the effectiveness of Federal
energy management efforts. Further, changes in energy utilization can also be positively
affected through installation of more modern equipment that, while not accounted for in energy project
investments, consumes less energy to operate (e.g. photocopiers).  It should be noted that
Federal investments in energy efficiency retrofits do not account for replacement of inefficient
equipment that has reached the end of its useful life; these replacements are made from other
operating accounts. 
<P>
This analysis suggests that the Federal energy management infrastructure,
in addition to identifying and installing capital energy efficiency retrofits,
is seeking out and implementing efficiency changes in operations and maintenance, new building
design, replacement equipment procurement, as well as undertaking simple conservation actions
(e.g. removing unneeded equipment).  It also suggests a future need for assessing the
costs and impacts of these non-investment actions.   
<H3>Projected Savings&#151;Meeting FY 2000 and 2005 Goals</H3>
<IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=20 SRC="images/cstsav2.gif">
The Energy Policy Act of 1992, and Executive Order 12902 established
Federal buildings efficiency goals of 20 percent and 30 percent reduction in FY
2000 and FY 2005, respectively, in energy consumption per gross square foot of building area.  These
goals challenge Federal agencies to double the rate of efficiency improvement over that
of the past ten years.
<P>
<STRONG><I>Successful accomplishment of the FY 2000 and FY 2005 goals will
result in enough energy savings to produce a net $15 billion in energy cost savings through
2015.</I></STRONG> FEMP, in a draft study<A HREF="#note4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> of investment needed to meet the established energy savings goals, estimated that over $6 billion in funding from FY 1996 through FY 2004 would be needed
to meet the energy savings goals.  The draft study projected a significant shift in funding
source from Federal appropriations to private sector financing in the form of Energy Savings Performance
Contracts (ESPCs). 
<P>
While private sector financing accomplishes the same energy savings
as those funded through Federal appropriations, the cost savings realized by the government are
divided between the government and the private sector contractor.  This results in a net total
return of $2.5 to the Federal government for every $1 invested through ESPCs.

<P>
The cost saving impacts of Federal energy management investment,
should investment continue through FY 2004 at anticipated levels, should extend through the
year 2024.  <A HREF="#table1">Table 1</A> summarizes the net investment and energy cost savings from Federal
energy management.
<P>
FEMP's additional mission focus of water conservation will provide
cost savings as well.  While specific data on Federal water use has not been precisely measured,
FEMP estimates that the annual Federal water/sewer bill approaches $1 billion annually.
 FEMP also estimates that the Federal government could save over $240 million each year by installing
cost effective water conservation measures such as low-flush toilets, faucet controls,
and landscape irrigation controls.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
Reported Federal energy costs, when examined in a constant dollar
analysis, demonstrate the effectiveness of Federal energy management efforts.  Key conclusions
of this study are: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>FY 1994 18.2 percent energy consumption reduction
and $1.5 billion energy cost reduction from FY 1985 are significant and real. 
<P>
<LI>An additional $10 billion in energy cost savings
will accrue over the life of investment projects already in place in FY 1994.
<P>
<LI>Over $15 billion in additional net energy cost savings
will accrue from FY 1995 through FY 2015 if sufficient Federal and private sector
investment is put in place through FY 2004.  Net cost savings should exceed $21
billion over the life of all past and potential future investment.
<P>
<LI>An active and effective Federal energy management
infrastructure is critical to implementing efficiency investments, and securing significant
savings from non-investment energy management actions.
<P>
<LI>Federal investment accounts for 48 percent of the
realized FY 1994 cost savings; other non-investment actions account for 35 percent
of cost savings.
<P>
<LI>Average total return on Federal energy efficiency
investment can be expected to be $5 for $1 invested; net return to the government
is $4:$1 for projects funded through appropriations, $2.5:$1 for private sector funded
projects.
<P>
<LI>Real energy price decline, and reduction Federal
building gross square footage account for 17 percent of FY 1994 savings.
