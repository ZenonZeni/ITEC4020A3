<h1 align=center>IDEA Reauthorization Officially Dies</h1>

<h2 align=center>IDEA Reauthorization is Dead</h2>
On Sept. 30, 1996, Senator Bill Frist announced that the Reauthorization
of IDEA will not be introduced on the Senate floor before the 104th
Congress adjourns. Despite the many good provisions in the bill and the
uncertainty about what the 105th Congress might do with the
Reauthorization of IDEA, on Sept. 25, LDA, along with other disability
organizations (ASHA, CED, NASP, NESS, NPND, The Arc, and UPCA) and regular
education groups (the American Association of School Administrators and
the Council of Great City Schools) had asked Senator Frist to postpone
passage of IDEA until the next Congress. They were concerned because of
the lack of time to study the effect of a last minute Manager's Package of
Amendments to IDEA on students with disabilities.

<p>The CCD (Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, a
coalition of over 65 disability organizations which work together on
legislation of common interest) Education Task Force sent a letter to the
Hill listing specific concerns:
<ol>
<li>cessation of educational services for certain students with
disabilities
<li>weakening of other civil rights issues, such as the requirement that
parents identify the remedy as well as the reason for the request for a
due process hearing, the stay put provisions under discipline, and the
provisions for changing the placement of children with "disruptive
behavior"
<li>failure to assure the presence of related services personnel, as
appropriate, at IEP meetings, and elimination of assistive techonology
considerations under special factors under the IEP
<li>uncertainty about discretionary programs
</ol>
<h2 align=center>What Does This Mean?</h2>
Failure to pass a Reauthorization bill does not affect Part B, which
contains all the assurances, protections, and safeguards for the education
of children with disabilities.  Part B remains the same and none of the
proposed changes - good and bad - are required. Authorization for the
discretionary programs (teacher and parent training, research and
development, early intervention, clearinghouses) has expired, but these
programs are all funded in the 1997 Appropriations bill.

<h2 align=center>What Happens Now?</h3>
Now is the time to prepare for the Reauthorization of IDEA in the 105th
Congress. Constituents should write or call their Congressmen (and
Congressional candidates) to express support for the promise of IDEA and
to offer to help explain any areas of uncertainty. Hopefully, the new
Congress will pass an IDEA which incorporates all of the good features and
eliminates the bad features of the proposals in the 104th Congress.
<p>Thank you all who responded to the many requests to provide input to
Congress in the last two years. Hope you will be joined by many more as we
work for a better IDEA in the 105th Congress
