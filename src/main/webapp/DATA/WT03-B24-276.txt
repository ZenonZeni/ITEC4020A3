<p><strong>Communists Say Republican Convention is a Wake-Up Call to Voters.</strong>
</p><p>Communist Party National Chairman, Gus Hall, branded the Republican national
convention "a scripted extravaganza of demagogy that raises the level of the
ultra right danger and the stakes in the 1996 elections."
</p><p>The Communist leader termed the convention "a corporate financed and
choreographed spectacle in which every tightly controlled speech was steeped
in hypocrisy with the aim of hoodwinking the millions of voters watching the
show on TV." Hall said attempts of the convention managers "to show inclusion
and diversity" came through "as total demagogy, considering the extremely
racist and anti-immigrant positions of the Republican platform." He predicted, "the
crude efforts to narrow the gender gap by highlighting a few women speakers
will fail to convince the mass of women who know the Republican anti-labor,
anti-people record." 
</p><p>Hall said that the smoke and mirrors convention recalled "the beginning of
fascism in Germany when Adolf Hitler's party called itself the 'German
National Socialist Party' with the sole aim of throwing people off guard. And
it worked -- for a while." He cautioned that "we must not allow the
exteme right forces in our country to portray themselves as the party that
will restore the American Dream when they are in fact promoting an American
nightmare."
</p><p>On the positive side Hall added, "This speaks volumes about the
democratic sentiments of the American people. The convention handlers felt
compelled to ban the words "Contract with America" and the candidates
distanced themselves from the platform, because the American people have rejected those
positions." "But the danger is great," he went on. President Clinton's
statement earlier that he would sign the Republican, anti-people welfare bill
was grist to the Republican mill. "That and the announcement of a Dole-Kemp ticket gave new
energy to the Republicans," he said. "It is already changing the electoral
picture and it will boost the sagging fortunes of the Gingrich Gang of 73,
the rich Republican right-wing businessmen and the religious right who
are out to destroy the economic and democratic rights of the people. The
deceptive tactics displayed at their convention should serve as a wake-up
call to step up voter registration and education campaigns. The stakes have
never been greater."
