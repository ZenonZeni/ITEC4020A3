<h2>CLAIM III: LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED USE
AND INCREASED ADDICTION LEVELS </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A cornerstone of the legalization proponents' position is the
claim that making illegal drugs legal would not cause more of
these substances to be consumed, nor would addiction increase.
They claim that many people can use drugs in moderation and that
many would choose not to use drugs, just as many forego alcohol
and tobacco now. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no
evidence that drug use would increase with more sensible
policies. In fact, they found that drug use would probably
decrease with more sensible policies. </p>

<p>They also found that, even if drug use did increase,
decriminalization would still be a better approach simply because
of all the harm caused by the current policy. See the list of the
Biggest Studies of Drug Policy, also on these web pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum felt strongly that
when drugs are more widely available--as they certainly would be
if they were legalized--rates of use and addiction would
increase. </p>

<p>Legalizing drugs sends a message that drug use (like tobacco
and alcohol) is acceptable, and encourages drug use among people
who currently do not use drugs. </p>

<p>When the social taboos about premarital sex were removed, the
nation's illegitimate birthrate soared. And we are paying dearly
for it. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>All of the arguments here depend upon what you mean by
&quot;legalized&quot;. </p>

<p>No, it does not send any such message, and our society's
campaigns against tobacco are perhaps the best example. And of
course, the real question is: How many millions of people do we
have to put in prison to show the right amount of disapproval? </p>

<p>This is a &quot;TV-talk-show&quot; argument, which blithely
ignores the fact that the illegitimate birth rate is due to
problems much more complex than the taboo on premarital sex. </p>

<p>Does this mean that, as a solution, the DEA is proposing that
we throw people in prison for premarital sex? There are lots of
ways to discourage something without throwing people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look to our history. For years, the United States legally
refined morphine from opium, and hailed it as a miracle drug.
Many soldiers on both sides of the Civil War who were given
morphine for their wounds became addicted to it. Are we ready for
more morphine addicts? Crack addicts? Heroin addicts? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Morphine was first refined when many battle wounds were
treated with simple amputation without anesthesia and a doctor
was considered a good surgeon if he could do the amputation
quickly to minimize the pain. In the medical context of that type
of &quot;surgery&quot; and the fact that there were no
antibiotics to control infections, morphine was a real miracle
drug because it relieved a great deal of suffering. </p>

<p>The figures differ on the number of Civil War veterans who
became addicts, partly because of the difficulty in defining what
an addict is. There was widespread use of these drugs simply
because there were no regulations at all during this period and
they were included in many common patent medicines, including
remedies for baby colic. There is no evidence that the Civil War
veterans who became addicts were any more of a problem to society
than a modern tobacco addict. The 1905 Pure Food and Drug Act was
the first law to require manufacturers to state the contents of
their mixtures on the label. This was clearly a good law because
it helped consumers make an informed decision. Drug use declined
steadily between the time the law was passed and 1914, when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed. See any of the major studies
listed elsewhere in this book for a more complete history of the
subject. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Early in the 20th Century, drugs were plentiful, cheap, and
legal in the United States. Some could even be bought from the
Sears Catalogue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But Americans realized that these legalized drugs were harmful
to individuals and society, and drug laws were written. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is not true. The reasons were more complex than this and
were largely based on racism and ignorance. No evidence was
presented to Congress to show that prohibition was either
necessary or desirable. No evidence was even presented to show
that these drugs were even medically harmful. In the case of
cocaine and the opiates, it is doubtful if Congress realized it
was passing what would be regarded as a general prohibition on
these drugs because it was phrased as a tax act. In the case of
marijuana (hemp) it is clear that most members of Congress did
not realize that they were passing a law to prohibit the most
common crop in America. These laws were a hoax from the very
begining. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>CocaCola took the coca out of its popular soft drink and
substituted caffeine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. The original name of Coca-Cola was &quot;French
Wine of Coca -- Invigorating Tonic&quot;. It is also true that
there was a campaign to outlaw caffeine for the same reasons that
cocaine was outlawed. That campaign died when it was realized
that caffeine was contained in too many common foods, such as
coffee, tea, and chocolate. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents would have them put it back, and make
opium as available as chewing gum. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is a flat-out lie and a cheap, deliberate attempt to
distort the arguments. It shows that the DEA has set up
&quot;legalization&quot; as a straw man, defined in their own
extreme terms. We do not agree with this extreme policy, or the
DEA's extreme definition of &quot;legalization&quot;. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>More recently Alaska decriminalized the personal use of small
amounts of marijuana in the home. The experiment did not turn out
the way legalization proponents had predicted. Although the legal
age for using marijuana was 19, adolescents as young as 12 years
old were using the drug. Alaskans eventually came to the
realization that decriminalization did not work, and voted to
overturn the law. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Twelve-year-olds using marijuana (hemp) is nothing new. I
observed pre-teens using marijuana (hemp) more than twenty-five
years ago, and it appeared to me that it was fairly common among
children of that age. Decriminalization in any area has never
been shown to have any real effect on the use patterns of
marijuana. </p>

<p>The law was overturned because of a massive campaign headed by
then-Drug-Czar William Bennett as one of the cornerstones of his
campaigns against the evils of drugs. Bennett, at the time, was a
tobacco addict. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts believe that legalization of drugs would decrease
the perception of risk currently associated with drug use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Let's assume that the DEA experts are right. How many millions
of people do we have to put in prison to create the proper
perception of risk? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group strongly endorsed the notion that the Government
should help protect people from substances and activities that
are harmful to themselves the community and society at large. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>So why aren't we throwing people in prison for alcohol or
tobacco? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Herbert Kleber, prominent psychiatrist from Yale
University, former Demand Reduction Deputy Director at the Office
of National Drug Control Policy and currently with the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, states in a
1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine that clinical
data support the premise that drug use would increase with
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not define what he means by
&quot;legalization.&quot; There are any number of different
policies which could be defined as &quot;legalization,&quot; each
of which could have widely varying effects. Therefore, all the
rest of his statements on the subject are essentially
meaningless. Even if he did define what he means by
&quot;legalization&quot;, it is not the only option we have for
drug policy. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>He says: &quot;There are over 50 million nicotine addicts, 18
million alcoholics or problem drinkers, and fewer than 2 million
cocaine addicts in the United States. Cocaine is a much more
addictive drug than alcohol. If cocaine were legally available,
as alcohol and nicotine are now, the number of cocaine abusers
would probably rise to a point somewhere between the number of
users of the other two agents, perhaps 20 to 25 million...the
number of compulsive users might be nine times higher...than the
current number. When drugs have been widely available--as...
cocaine was at the turn of the century--both use and addiction
have risen &quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>See the table below for the latest ratings on the relative
addictive qualities of drugs. </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not suggest that the most productive approach
to the 50 million nicotine addicts, or the 18 million alcoholics,
is to put alcohol or tobacco users in prison. Why not? </p>

<p>Drug use was widespread at the turn of the century. This
statement ignores the fact that drug use and addiction fell
steadily after manufacturers were required to list the
ingredients in their products. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> England's experience with widely available heroin shows
that use and addiction increase. Great Britain allowed doctors to
prescribe heroin to addicts. There was an explosion of heroin use
and by the mid-1980s known addiction rates were increasing by
about 30% a year. According to the Lancet, the wellrespected
medical journal (Lancet, January 9, 1982), 2,657 heroin addicts
were registered in 1970 compared with 5,107 in 1980. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>By the mid-1980's Great Britain was fully into the American
style drug war so it is apparent that, if there is any connection
between the drug war and addiction, the drug war must have made
the problem worse. </p>

<p>It is also worthwhile to note that the figures show that the
number of heroin addicts doubled in ten years, but the numbers
were still trivial in comparison to the number of addicts in any
comparable segment of the United States. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>This was a program in which heroin users needed a doctor's
authorization to get their drug. What would happen if anyone
wanting to try heroin could simply buy it at the government
store? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The vast majority of them would throw up after using it and
find they really didn't like the effects. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alaska tried the legalization experiment and abandoned it.
Legalization was given a lengthy try closer to home when the
Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that the state could not
interfere with a person's possession of marijuana in his home for
personal use. Enforcement was permitted only when the quantity
possessed exceeded four ounces--this in a state that, because of
the long, sunny days of its brief growing season, produces extra
potent marijuana. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Alaska's ruling applied to personal possession of hemp
(marijuana) and use within the confines of one's own home. This
is a far cry from the &quot;legalization&quot; the DEA talks
about elsewhere. The court decided that the right of privacy
protected the citizen's rights within their own home. </p>

<p>All states are capable of producing extra potent marijuana.
Alaska is nothing special in this regard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The court's ruling was interpreted by many Alaskans as a
signal to light up, and so they did, especially the young ones,
even though the ruling was limited to persons 19 and over.
According to a 1988 University of Alaska study, the state's 12 to
17yearolds used marijuana at more than twice the national average
for their age group. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is ludicrous to state that an Alaskan Supreme Court
decision would be interpreted by anyone as a &quot;signal to
light up.&quot; It is highly doubtful if teenagers govern their
behavior based on Supreme Court decisions. Anyone who wants to
use a drug is going to do so regardless of what the Supreme Court
may have said about it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;The frequency with which marijuana was used within the
current sample,&quot; the report on the study said,
&quot;suggests that it is not an experimental event for many
students, but that it seems to have become well incorporated into
the lifestyle of many adolescents.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And the DEA suggests that the best way to improve these
students lives is to hunt them down and put them in jail to cure
them of their lifestyle. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Although they historically cling to their personal liberties,
Alaska residents voted in 1990 to recriminalize possession of
marijuana, demonstrating their belief that increased use was too
high a price to pay for increased personal liberties. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A referendum was passed in 1990 by Alaska voters which
attempted to overturn the Alaska Supreme Court decision. The
referendum was the result of an intensive, well-funded campaign
by then-Drug Czar William Bennett and other drug wars to remove a
major embarrassment to their cause -- the fact that Alaska had
protected private use of marijuana and Alaskan society had not
fallen apart as a result. The courts later threw out the vote
because the issue had been decided on a matter of basic
constitutional protections of privacy, which cannot be voted away
under Alaskan law. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Will the public support an aggressive marketing approach?
While &quot;government drugs&quot; could conceivably be priced
low enough, perhaps by having taxpayers subsidize them to
discourage a black market, the combination of low price and ready
availability would bring more consumption, more addiction. We
would have won the battle and lost the war. If they see this as
the probable outcome, the American people can hardly be expected
to endorse a &quot;sell at all costs&quot; policy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Why should there be an aggressive marketing approach? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert L. DuPont, M.D., former director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, considered the impact legalization would
have on use and addiction rates in a paper published in 1994. </p>

<p>&quot;Would legalization increase the number of drug users and
the social harm produced by the use of drugs?&quot; Dr. DuPont
asked. &quot;The answer to those two questions is simply, 'Yes,
it would.&quot;' </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The answer to this question is simply: What
&quot;legalization&quot; are you talking about? Until you define
what you mean by &quot;legalization&quot; you can't define what
the likely effect on the number of drug users and social harm. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The current global experience with alcohol and tobacco reveals
the downside of legalization clearly, Dr. DuPont said. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is certainly true, keeping in mind the fact these drugs
are only legal under certain conditions. Despite this, Dr. DuPont
is not suggesting that we outlaw alcohol and tobacco as the most
appropriate response. Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization of any drugs leads to large increases in
the use of the legalized drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;Because most
of the social costs of drugs are not the costs of prohibition but
the costs created by the drug use itself (a point proved beyond
dispute by the dismal global experience with alcohol and
tobacco), legalization raises the net social costs of drug use. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK12"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"
align="bottom" width="562" height="19"></a><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if we assumed this to be true, every major study of drug
policy has said that the cost of the current policy far outweighs
the other potential costs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization is an old, siren call which promises to
reduce the high costs of drug use, but which abundant evidence
shows would inevitably raise the costs society pays for drug use,
not reduce them. We do not need new experiments to make <br>
