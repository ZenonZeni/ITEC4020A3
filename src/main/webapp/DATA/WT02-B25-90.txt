<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is ECT? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - application of a brief electric stimulus to produce a generalized seizure </p>
<p>2 - treatment for severe mental illness (i.e. acute mania, some schizophrenia) </p>
<p>3 - the most controversial treatment in psychiatry </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. the nature of ECT itself </p>
<p>b. history of abuse </p>
<p>c. unfavorable media presentations </p>
<p>d. compelling testimony of patients </p>
<p>e. special legal attention </p>
<p>f. uneven distribution among practitioners &amp; facilities </p>
<p>g. uneven access by patients </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">History/Use </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - 1940s &amp; 1950s </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. administered to the most seriously ill in mental institutions </p>
<p>b. used for a variety of disorders </p>
<p>c. frequently given in high doses &amp; for long periods of time </p>
<p>d. often ineffective &amp; even harmful </p>
<p>e. used as a means of managing unruly patients for whom other treatments were 
unavailable - led to a perception of ECT as an abusive instrument of behavioral control 
for the institutionalized chronically ill </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 - use has waned with the introduction of effective psychopharmacological medications &amp; with the 
development of judicial/regulatory restrictions </p>
<p>3 - now used mainly in general hospital psychiatric units &amp; in psychiatric hospitals </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Concerns </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - is it being used when alternative treatment is possible? </p>
<p>2 - is it truly effective over time? </p>
<p>3 - isn't there potential for misuse &amp; abuse? </p>
<p>4 - is its use a violation of patients' rights? </p>
<p>5 - would curtailing use deprive certain patients of potentially effective treatment? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Effectiveness </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - measured only in terms of symptom reduction, not in terms of quality of life or social functioning </p>
<p>2 - ECT as treatment for depression </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. the most effective treatment for short-term management of depression </p>
<p>b. relapse rates are high unless maintenance antidepressants are used </p>
<p>c. more rapid onset of action than antidepressants </p>
<p>d. not effective for mild depressions (i.e. dysthymic or adjustment disorder) </p>
<p>e. only advantageous in the short term </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3 - ECT as treatment for delusional depression </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. highly effective </p>
<p>b. superior to antidepressants or neuroleptics </p>
<p>c. effective for those previously unresponsive to treatment </p>
<p>d. long-term efficacy is unknown </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4 - ECT as treatment for endogenous/melancholic depression </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. effective short-term treatment </p>
<p>b. effective for those previously unresponsive to antidepressants </p>
<p>c. long-term efficacy is unknown </p>
</blockquote>
<p>5 - ECT as treatment for acute manic episode </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. equally effective as lithium </p>
<p>b. superior to hospitalization without somatic therapy </p>
<p>c. when followed by lithium maintenance, no increased risk of relapse </p>
</blockquote>
<p>6 - ECT as treatment for schizophrenia </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. neuroleptics are the first treatment that should be tried </p>
<p>b. effective for those with a short duration of illness, a more acute onset, &amp; more 
intense affective symptoms </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How to maximize the benefits of ECT? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - perform a pretreatment medical examination </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. history </p>
<p>b. physical </p>
<p>c. neurologic examination </p>
<p>d. EKG </p>
<p>e. laboratory tests </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 - when clinically feasible, decrease or discontinue medications that affect the seizure threshold 
before beginning ECT treatment </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. discontinue MAOI 2 weeks before treatment </p>
<p>b. be lithium-free </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3 - get severe hypertension under control before treatment </p>
<p>4 - evaluate &amp; monitor cardiac conditions </p>
<p>5 - educate the patient &amp; family prior to obtaining written informed consent </p>
<p>6 - designate an area for ECT administration &amp; recovery </p>
<p>a. have appropriate health care professionals available </p>
<p>b. include equipment &amp; medications to use in the event of complications </p>
<p>7 - use a professional specifically trained &amp; certified in the use of brief anesthetic procedures </p>
<p>8 - include trained nursing personnel on the treatment team </p>
<p>9 - use the lowest amount of electrical energy to induce an adequate seizure </p>
<p>10 - remember that bilateral ECT is often more effective </p>
<p>11 - remember that nondominant unilateral ECT results in shorter confusional periods &amp; fewer 
memory deficits </p>
<p>12 - remember that a brief pulse stimulus results in fewer cognitive deficits than the sine wave 
stimulus </p>
<p>13 - monitor seizures with an EEG or by placing a blood pressure cuff on an arm or leg &amp; inflating 
it above systolic pressure prior to the injection of a muscle relaxer </p>
<p>14 - after treatment, continue patients on antidepressant medication or lithium </p>
<p>15 - include ECT education in medical school curricula </p>
<p>16 - include ECT training in psychiatric residency programs </p>
<p>17 - include questions about ECT in oral &amp; written medical examinations </p>
<p>18 - establish regulations &amp; review committees in hospitals &amp; centers using ECT </p>
<p>19 - require periodic inspection of ECT equipment </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Treatment administration </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - begin in the early morning after 8 to 12 hours of fasting </p>
<p>2 - give atropine or another anticholinergic agent prior to treatment </p>
<p>3 - place an IV in a peripheral vein until after recovery </p>
<p>4 - provide the anesthetic methohexital &amp; then succinylcholine for muscle relaxation </p>
<p>5 - provide ventilatory assistance with a positive pressure bag using 100% oxygen </p>
<p>6 - monitor EKG, blood pressure, &amp; pulse rate throughout procedure </p>
<p>7 - place stimulus electrodes bifrontotemporally or with one electrode frontatemporally &amp; the 
second on the ipsilateral side </p>
<p>8 - 6 to 12 treatments are usually effective </p>
<p>9 - the usual frequency is 3 times weekly in the US/2 times weekly in the UK </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When is ECT appropriate </font>treatment? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - only in those conditions for which efficacy has been established </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. delusional &amp; severe endogenous depressions </p>
<p>b. acute mania </p>
<p>c. certain schizophrenic syndromes </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 - after complex consideration of advantages/disadvantages in the individual case </p>
<p>3 - after all other alternatives have been fully considered, tested, &amp; ruled out </p>
<p>4 - when absolutely necessary to preserve life </p>
<p>5 - when there is a risk of suicide not manageable by any other means </p>
<p>6 - only for the benefit of individuals, not for institutions </p>
<p>7 - for acute manic episode characterized by certain symptoms </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. clouded sensorium </p>
<p>b. dehydration </p>
<p>c. extreme psychomotor agitation </p>
<p>d. high risk for serious medical complications </p>
<p>e. death through exhaustion </p>
<p>f. nonresponse to pharmacological interventions </p>
</blockquote>
<p>8 - after consideration of ones emotional suffering or extreme incapacitation </p>
<p>9 - when medical conditions preclude the use of other treatment </p>
<p>10 - for severe depression or psychosis during the 1st trimester of pregnancy </p>
<p>11 - after certain conditions have been ruled out </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. increased intracranial pressure </p>
<p>b. space-occupying lesions in the brain </p>
<p>c. recent history of myocardial infarction </p>
<p>d. large aneurysms </p>
<p>e. personal history of unresponsiveness </p>
<p>f. personal history of debilitating side effects </p>
</blockquote>
<p>12 - when the patient has freely given informed consent </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. when the patient is aware of all other treatment/nontreatment options </p>
<p>b. when the patient is aware of the possible risks &amp; benefits involved </p>
<p>c. when the patient understands the character of the procedure </p>
<p>d. when the physician has strove to identify &amp; clarify the options that the patient alone is 
entitled to exercise </p>
<p>e. when the physician initiates periodic reviews of the patient's consent </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1. risks &amp; benefits change in nature throughout treatment </p>
<p>2. the patient's mental capacity changes during treatment </p>
<p>3. ECT results in memory loss so continuous consent is essential </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>f. a court must issue consent for an incompetent patient </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Future research requirements </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - a national survey </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. assemble the basic facts about ECT use </p>
<p>b. study patient attitudes &amp; responses to ECT </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 - identify the biological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ECT &amp; resulting memory 
deficits </p>
<p>3 - delineate the long-term effects of ECT on affective illnesses &amp; cognition </p>
<p>4 - determine the mode of electrode placement &amp; stimulus parameters that maximize efficacy &amp; 
minimize cognitive impairment </p>
<p>5 - identify patient subgroups for whom ECT is particularly beneficial or toxic </p>
