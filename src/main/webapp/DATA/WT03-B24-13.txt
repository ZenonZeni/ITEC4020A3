<H2><CENTER>The Italian Connection at GMU</CENTER>
</H2>
<HR>The Italian Connection at GMU started in the summer of 1991, with the
arrival of the two explorers, <B>Elisa Bertino</B> and <B>Pierangela Samarati</B>,
to GMU on a very special mission - that of establishing a strong connection
between Italy and the USA! Their mission was so successful that they made
it a point to be present during the subsequent summers, and in 1994 they
brought along with them the rest of the army - <B>Claudio Bettini</B> and
<B>Luigi Mancini</B>. <BR>
<BR>
During this period, the Italian team has been involved mostly with <B>Professor
Jajodia</B> and other affiliates of the Center for Secure Information Systems.
The research work has focused on several topics related to database security,
including transaction management in multilevel systems, extended authorization
models, and to temporal databases. Their stay has been very productive with
the publication of a number of papers in various conferences as well as
journals. <BR>
<BR>
In order to cement this relationship, Professor Jajodia spent a <B><I>glorious</I></B>
(his words!) month this May at the University of Milan. He also had an opportunity
to visit the University of Genova. Brief biosketches of the visitors are
given below. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><I><STRONG>Elisa Bertino</STRONG></I> is professor of computer science
in the Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione of the University of Milan
where she heads the Database Systems Group. <BR>
<BR>
She has also been a professor in the Dipartimento di Informatica e Scienze
dell'Informazione of the University of Genoa, Italy. Until 1990, she was
a researcher for the Italian National Research Council in Pisa, Italy, where
she headed the Object-Oriented Systems Group. She has been a visiting researcher
at the IBM Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, and at the MCC in Austin,
Texas. Her main research interests include database security, object-oriented
databases, distributed databases, deductive databases, multimedia databases,
interoperability of heterogeneous systems. She is a co-author of the book
<I>Object-Oriented Database Systems - Concepts and Architectures</I> , (Addison-Wesley,
1993). She is on the editorial board of the: <I>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge
and Data Engineerin</I>g, <I>International Journal of Theory and Practice
of Object Systems</I>, <I>Journal of Computer Security</I>, <I>Data and
Knowledge Engineering Journal</I>, and <I>Journal of Parallel and Distributed
Databases</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><B><I>Claudio Bettini</I></B> received the Laurea degree in Computer
Sciences in 1987 and a PhD in Computer Science in 1993 from the University
of Milano. He has been an Assistant Professor at Dipartimento di Scienze
dell'Informazione, University of Milan, since 1993. His main research interest
is temporal reasoning in knowledge and data bases. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><B><I>Luigi Mancini </I></B>received the Laurea degree in Computer Science
from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 1983, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer
Science from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Great Britain, in 1989.
From 1989 to 1992, he was an Assistant Professor at the Dipartimento di
Informatica of the University of Pisa. Since 1992 he has been an Associate
Professor of the Dipartimento di Informatica Scienze dell'Informazione of
the University of Genoa. His research interests include database and operating
system architecture. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><B><I>Pierangela Samarati</I></B> received the Laurea degree in Computer
Science from University of Milan in 1988. Since 1990, she has been an assistant
professor at the Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione, University of
Milan. Her main research interests are information systems security, database
security, authorization models, and databases. She has been a visiting researcher
at Stanford University, and at George Mason University. She is currently
serving as the Italian representative in the IFIP Technical Committee 11
on Security and Protection in Information Processing Systems. She has co-authored
the book Database Security (Addison-Wesley, 1994). <BR>
