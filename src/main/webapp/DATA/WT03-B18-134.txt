<h1><b>Today is the tomorrow you dreamed of yesterday!</b></h1><br>
<p align="CENTER">Off-line, robot programming is possible with the new 
"intelligent" software options</p>

<p><b>Fort Myers Beach, FL</b> (September 6, 1996): For the past twenty -five years, the robotics industry has dreamed and worked to find the solution to robot accuracy. Repeatability has been perfected with robot manufacturers concentrating on the hardware of the robot. Now that we have achieved this level of repeatability we want accuracy. Will it come from hardware innovations or follow in the footsteps of the other leading edge technology, from intelligent software solutions.</p>

<p>A technology company in Fort Myers Beach, FL has combined the knowledge of a 25 yr. Founder of the industry and an inexpensive software program to achieve what everyone thinks is impossible. Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc., has proven at multiple sites that robot accuracy is not only attainable but is also affordable. Using the Robotrak and Workspace software package, they have achieved results that no robot manufacturer would begin to offer a user. Their customers have improved inaccuracies from 22mm to .9mm and subsequently saved millions of dollars in the first year.</p> 

<p>The piece to the puzzle that has been neglected is in the "brain" of the robot; the software that controls it. Robot manufacturers and third party software vendors have either walked away or have avoided following in the same directions as other technology markets. The PC revolution would have stalled 10 years ago if they had relied on hardware innovations to fuel the advancements in computer technology. It was the software development companies that have created more intelligent programs that have conversely solved many of the hardware limitations.</p> 

<p>The technology is available today that will allow you to go beyond mastering your robot and allow you to "signature" each robot. By defining the robot's manufactured discrepancies, each robot can be calibrated in off-line programming to achieve accuracy at the tool tip.
It is these robot discrepancies that have plagued robot, off-line programming innovators to state that it is "just not possible."</p>

<p>Robotrak&reg; and Workspace&reg; are the cost effective solutions to off-line programming through actual native language programming of your production floor robot. With these two, PC based applications, you can get each individual robots signature and then utilize the kinematics of each robot as you generate the off-line program.
</p>

<p>Robotrak&reg; is the robot calibration and signature tool that utilizes a series of calibration moves to provide Workspace, an off-line and simulation software package, with the measurements of difference in the robot components. Through the use of Robotrak, you can generate a true signature of the robot that is then utilized in the calculation of the robot program through Workspace&reg;. It is this measurement of robot arm positioning that permits Workspace&reg; to effectively and accurately off-line program the robot controller.
</p>

<p>Once the signature is determined, about a 30 minute operation, the differentiation in the kinematics is applied to the robot arm positioning algorithm. This imported data becomes a true simulation of the robot on the production floor. Now when Workspace&reg; creates the simulation using your imported, 3D CAD part, you are actually programming the exact robot you have on the floor to the exact part you are manufacturing. Now off-line programming with accuracy is achievable.
</p>

<p>Workspace&reg; does not utilize language translators but instead uses interpreters that allow you to program in native language just like a teach pendant would. This eliminates the problems associated with other third party programs that program in a proprietary language and rely on post processors to translate the language into something the robot controller can understand.</p> 

<p>"We recently received a request from an automotive OEM supplier who was looking for a way to reduce robot programming downtime and to improve tolerances to under 3 mm," said Walt Weisel, CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, the exclusive North American dealer of Robotrak and Workspace. "They were losing over $17,000 per month in downtime charged to reprogramming robots. In addition, the lost production at $12.00 per part, per minute created an additional loss of $204,000. Within a 1.5 hour process with Robotrak and Workspace, we were able to take the part tolerance to within .9 mm of accuracy and cut the programming time down to under one hour. An hourly programming savings of over 6 hours on just one of their 30 robots. A high ranking official was so astonished when he added up all of the savings, that he is implementing a 200 plant task force to implement the technology. The total annual savings could, conservatively, exceed $200 million dollars in the first year."
</p>

<p>To walk away from off-line programming or to settle for the results you are getting is a shame. There is a better answer to achieve substantial savings and to reduce downtime production losses due to teach pendant programming and minimally successful off-line programming.
