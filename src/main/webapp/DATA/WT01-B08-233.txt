</font><font size=3><b><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT<p></CENTER>


President Clinton and I are committed to promoting the growth of electronic 
commerce and robust, secure communications worldwide while protecting the 
public safety and national security.  To that end, this Administration is 
consulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state and local 
law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major initiative to 
liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products.<p>


The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to use 
stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect their 
privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.  It will support 
the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of the global 
information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S. encryption 
product manufacturers during the transition to a key management infrastructure.

<p> 

Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption products 
will be permitted under a general license after one-time review, and contingent 
upon industry commitments to build and market future products that support key 
recovery.  This policy will apply to hardware and software products.  The 
relaxation of controls will last up to two years.<p>  

 

The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technology 
strategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the ultimate 
solution must be market-driven.  

 <p>

Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make 
commitments to develop and sell products that support the key recovery system 
that I announced in July.  That vision presumes that a trusted party (in some 
cases internal to the user's organization) would recover the user's 
confidentiality key for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under 
proper authority.  Access to keys would be provided in accordance with 
destination country policies and bilateral understandings.  No key length 
limits or algorithm restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products. 

 <p>

Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain 
free to use any encryption system domestically.  

 <p>

The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption 
policy initiative designed to promote electronic information security and 
public safety.  For export control purposes, commercial encryption products 
will no longer be treated as munitions.  After consultation with Congress, 
jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred from the 
State Department to the Commerce Department.  The Administration also will seek 
legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providing 
penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery agents 
against liability when they properly release a key.
<p>


As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the 
purchase of key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote key recovery 
arrangements in bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop federal 
cryptographic and key recovery standards, and stimulate the development of 
innovative key recovery products and services.

 <p>

Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued after 
one-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit 
benchmarks and milestones for developing and incorporating key recovery 
features into their products and services, and for building the supporting 
infrastructure internationally.  Initial approval will be contingent on firms 
providing a plan for implementing key recovery.  The plan will explain in 
detail the steps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute, 
and/or market encryption products with key recovery features.  The specific 
commitments will depend on the applicant's line of business.<p>  

 

The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periods if 
milestones are met.  Two years from now, the export of 56-bit products that do 
not support key recovery will no longer be permitted.  Currently exportable 
40-bit mass market software products will continue to be exportable.  We will 
continue to support financial institutions in their efforts to assure the 
recovery of encrypted financial information.  Longer key lengths will continue 
to be approved for products dedicated to the support of financial applications. 

 <p>

The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry, users, 
state and local law enforcement, and other private sector representatives with 
the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery.  Topics will include:<br>
<UL><LI> evaluating the developing global key recovery architecture
<BR>
<LI>assessing  lessons-learned from key recovery implementation
<BR>
<LI>advising on technical confidence issues vis-a-vis access to and release of keys
<BR>
<LI> addressing interoperability and standards issues
<BR>
<LI>identifying other technical, policy, and program issues for governmental
action.</UL>


The Administration's initiative is broadly consistent with the recent 
recommendations of the National Research Council.  It also addresses many of 
the objectives of pending Congressional legislation.<P>
