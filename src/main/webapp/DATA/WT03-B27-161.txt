Looking into the future<BR>
is easy for this searcher</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>

How can you project what will happen before it actually happens?  It's easy.  
Just ask Rita McDowall and she'll tell how easy it is to peer into the future  
of the energy and utility field with NewsNet.  <P>

Rita is primarily responsible for researching competitive  
intelligence and pricing for the marketing department at Central Illinois  
Public Service Company (CIPS).  CIPS, a public utility, conducts all core  
research on an in-house level and recently began intense competitive tracking  
with NewsFlash.  <P>
  
Rita likes NewsFlash for easy retrieval of the information she needs to  
project possible mergers or uncover services the competition may offer in the  
near future.  <P>
  
"The utility area is very competitive.  NewsNet helps us pinpoint the changes  
occurring with the competition.  NewsNet helps you know your competitors, as  
well as you know yourself, " Rita says.  "With NewsNet, I don't waste time  
waiting for what I need.  I could go into NewsNet and find a company profile  
or an analysis of the latest development in the field.  It's so easy, and the  
news is so timely," Rita says.  <P>
  
Another benefit is the large number of newsletters online covering the energy  
and utility fields and the ability to pull stories off the newswires.  "We  
like to see what the newswires release online related to our field.  Sometimes  
a story about a utility a thousand miles away will be a real benefit to us,"  
she explains.  <P>
  
Rita feels the analysis is simplified when the right information is at your  
fingertips and no time is wasted.  <P>
  
"When all the needed information is in front of you, it's much easier to  
complete the analysis.  We want to be able to make accurate projections as  
soon as possible- before something happens.  It's how we remain competitive in  
the field," she adds.    <P>
