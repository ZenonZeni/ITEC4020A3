<H2>Information about the Amos Tide Calendar:</H2> 
<P>The calendar shows predicted tides for the Aransas Pass Ship Channel
connecting the Gulf of Mexico with Corpus Christi Bay. Other locations will soon
be available. Predictions are based on a one-year series of measurements made in
1973-1974 at the Army Corps of Engineers stilling well tower which is located
off the South Jetty of the Aransas Pass just east of the University of Texas
Marine Science Institute's facility in Port Aransas. From the series, 37
harmonic constituents of the astronomical tide were calculated and used in a
modification of the standard National Ocean Survey tidal prediction program to
make hourly water level predictions and the times of the highs and lows for each
day. The water level is adjusted to mean sea level rather than the Gulf Coast
Datum. Consequently, the annual and semi-annual variation in sea level can be
clearly seen in the position of the daily tide fluctuations relative to the zero
mean sea level line (Compare January when low tides prevail with October when
the opposite is true). Each hour is indicated by a vertical line connecting the
curve with the zero line. In general, slack water will be at the times which the
curve intersects the zero axis, but when the curve is offset as in January and
October, some interpolation may be necessary. Flood and ebb tidal currents will
be at a maximum at the times of high and low water respectively. This
astronomical tide is often radically changed by strong winds before and during
the passages of cold fronts and during extra tropical depressions. The
astronomical signal will still be found &quot;riding&quot; on top of the
meteorological surges. Past history has shown that the predicted times are quite
accurate, although the range of the tides in the predictions is somewhat
exaggerated. The author is working on new predictions based on a multi-year
tidal series measured at the UTMSI pier (since 1985). </P> 
<P>Local times of the highs and lows are listed beneath each daily box (all
heights are given in feet and all times are local). They are listed in &quot;order
of appearance&quot;; if the first tide extreme is a low then the time and height
will be preceded by L1, for the Low 1. Heights here are given in feet and
inches. The next tide will be H1 for High 1, etc. These numbers may be difficult
to read on some VGA screens. Note: the English units are given here because it
is the system most commonly used by the general public. The shaded areas each
day show the hours of darkness. Phases of the moon are shown for each day with
the New Moon (NM), First quarter (FQ), Full Moon (FM), and Last Quarter (LQ)
marked on the moon symbol where appropriate. The relative size and shape of the
moon will be quite close to reality each day, but the moon's orientation is
always vertical on the calendar. The author is working on a method of depicting
the moon as it appears to the observer. The symbols appear on the night of the
day closest to when the phase occurs, e.g. If full moon is at 1215 (24-hour
clock) on the 25th of a month, then the symbol will appear straddling midnight
of the 25th. Should it occur at 1145 then the symbol will appear on the 24th of
the month. </P> 
<P>The local time zone in use is given at the top of each monthly chart. When
Daylight Savings Time comes into effect in April and reverts to standard time in
October is depicted by either a shorter or longer day and the symbol &quot;CDT&quot;
for Central Daylight Time, or &quot;CST&quot; for Central Standard Time on the
day these changes take place. Notice how it messes up a perfectly good calendar.
This was one of the more difficult aspects of the calendar to program. If anyone
notes any obvious errors or has any comments, please contact Tony Amos by email.
