<H2>CDT Presents Testimony at FTC Hearings</h2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on June 5, 1996 || Last Updated on June 18, 1996</FONT>
<P>
On June 4th and 5th, CDT participated in the Federal Trade Commission's "Workshop on
Consumer Privacy on the Global Information Infrastructure". Privacy advocates, industry
representatives, and FTC officials gathered to discuss the privacy issues posed by the evolving online marketplace, and the potential technologies that can be used to address these issues.  Attendees also discussed the issue of children's privacy in the online world.
<P>
At the workshop, CDT offered an overview of privacy considerations in the online world and its model for privacy protecting technologies which empower users to exercise more control over the collection and use of personally identifiable information online. CDT also presented its Privacy Demonstration Page to workshop attendees.
