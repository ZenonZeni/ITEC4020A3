<H1>TOPEX/Poseidon History & Future</H1>
<p>
<p>
<h3>
In 1979, NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"> (JPL) </A> began planning TOPEX, an experiment that would use a satellite <a href=alt_def.html>altimeter</a> to measure the height of the world's oceans.  At the same time the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) was designing an oceanographic mission called Poseidon, named for the Greek god of the sea.  In the early 1980's, they pooled their resources to form a single mission called TOPEX/Poseidon.

<p>
TOPEX/Poseidon's ability to accurately measure sea surface height  is 3 times better than the original requirement.  Given that the satellite flies at an altitude of 1336 km (830 miles), this is comparable to being able to detect less than the width of a U.S. dime on the surface of the ocean from a jet flying at 35,000 feet!
<p>
As part of the effort "to lay the foundation for a continuing program to provide long-term observations of ocean circulation" a follow-on mission is currently planned to launch during 1999.
