Ron Toms has had a varied career as an aeronautical engineer, a rocket scientist, a planner of missions to the planets, a director of geothermal research, and a program officer for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR). He has a multi-disciplinary background in the engineering and physical sciences.<P>

Born in England and educated at the Royal Naval Engineering College in Aeronautical Engineering (M.S.), and at London University in Mathematical Physics (a second M.S.), he became director of aerodynamics research at Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1949, developing the aerodynamic design of supersonic ramjets and the Concorde. He came to the U.S. in 1957 to build the first hypersonic wind tunnel for the U.S. Navy. In small businesses he developed and tested the first nuclear-powered ion rocket in the early '60s, and later joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he planned Mariner, Viking and Voyager missions to all the planets except Pluto.<P>

In 1975 Ron came to ERDA, which later became the Department of Energy (DOE), to direct research and technology development in geothermal energy, and joined the SBIR program at DOE in 1987. Ron retired from DOE in 1992 and became an associate of Dawnbreaker in 1993.<P>
