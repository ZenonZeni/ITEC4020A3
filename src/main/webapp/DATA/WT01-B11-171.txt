<B>WORKING AROUND WATER?<BR>
What you should know about <BR>Fish Habitat and Building Docks and Boathouses<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
The waters in front of your property are important fish habitat.  To maintain the shoreline waters so that fish may continue to live in these areas, you need to build your waterfront structures with care.<P>

This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to build a dock or boathouse.  It outlines the types of docks and boathouses that require a work permit under the Public Lands Act.  For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for dock or boathouse construction.  If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases.<P>
 
<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land. In the past, any dock or boathouse built on this land needed a work permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recent legislative changes removed the requirements for work permits for most docks and boathouses.  Listed below are the types of docks and boathouses that do, and do not, require a permit.<P>

Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau or Trent-Severn Waterway, these areas are under <B>Federal</B> jurisdiction.  Approval for in-water and shoreline works in these areas will be granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.<P> 
<OL>
<LI><B>Docks and boathouses which WILL NOT require a work permit:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Cantilever docks
<LI>Floating docks and floating boathouses
<LI>Docks and boathouses supported by posts, stilts, or poles
<LI>Boathouses built above the high water mark
<LI>Crib docks and crib boathouses where the total supporting crib structure (including historical crib structures) does not exceed 15 sq. metres in surface area.

<LI>Any combination of the above (e.g. a floating dock with a crib 
 < 15 sq. metres).
<LI>Boat lifts and marine railways
<LI>Removal of an old dock or boathouse
</UL><P>
<LI><B>Docks and boathouses which WILL require a work permit:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Crib docks and/or boathouses where the total surface of all historical cribs and the proposed new cribs exceeds 15 sq. metres in surface area.
<LI>Docks with solid foundations (e.g. concrete), jetty docks, or docks constructed with steel sheeting
<LI>Boathouses with solid foundations (e.g. concrete)
</UL>
</OL>
If you plan to build any of the structures described in section 2, you will need approval under the Public Lands Act through the work permit process.   You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. <P> 

Projects that require a work permit, pose a significant risk to the environment.  MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area.  This takes time, so submit your application early in the planning process.<P> 

Construction of any type of two story boathouse, or single story boathouse with living accommodations, on Crown land is not covered under the Ministry's free use policy.  As a result, although you do not need a work permit, you will require land use occupational authority under the Public Lands Act, at an appropriate fee.  If you are thinking about building any type of two story boathouse or a boathouse with living accommodation, contact your local MNR office early in the planning stage.<P> 
  
Keep in mind that you may need other approvals.  Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency.<P> 

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P> 

The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water frequented by fish.  Breaking these regulations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and you may be required to cover the costs of returning the site to its natural state.<P>   

If you suspect your property is adjacent to a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout,  walleye, pike, muskellunge, talk to staff at your local MNR office, or have your project reviewed by an environmental consultant.  These fish species often have only one spawning/nursery site in the waterbody.  Any structure placed near these sites could affect fish habitat and result in fewer fish.<P> <BR>
<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following best management practices will help to ensure that your dock or boathouse will not harmfully alter or destroy fish habitat.  Following these practices will help to ensure that the terms and conditions of the federal Fisheries Act are not violated. <P> 

In addition, it's a good idea to talk to local contractors, engineers, and building supply outlets, to ensure that all aspects of your project are completed properly.<P>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Select a structure which minimizes disturbance to the river or lake bottom:</B> Cantilever, floating and post-supported boathouses and docks do not disturb river or lake bottoms or restrict the movement of water near the shore.  These structures can actually improve fish habitat by providing fish with extra shelter from predators.   From a fish habitat perspective, these structures are preferred.  If your dock requires a concrete abutment, this should be located entirely on the upland property, above the high water mark.<P>
 
<LI><B>Limit the size of crib foundations:</B> Crib foundations for docks and boathouses are acceptable if there is bridging between them which enables water to circulate.  Small cribs are preferred.  Vertical planking is not recommended along the dock, because it can restrict water movement.  Remember, if the total surface area of your cribbing exceeds 15 square meters, including existing or old cribs, you will need a permit from MNR.<P>
 
<LI><B>Use clean rocks taken from dry land:</B> If you are planning to build a crib dock or boathouse, use rocks that are clean and free of soil.  The rocks must not be taken from the lake or river bottom, or the shoreline.  Removal of rocks from these areas could destroy fish habitat and result in charges under the federal Fisheries Act.<P>
 
<LI><B>Avoid any solid structures without bridging:</B> Generally, MNR will not approve solid docks made from cement or steel sheeting.  These structures are vulnerable to ice damage, destroy fish habitat, and can create stagnant backwater areas.<P>
 
<LI><B>Be careful with pressure-treated wood:</B> If you are planning to use pressure- treated lumber, all cutting, end sealing, staining, etc. should be done well back from the water.  The wood should be completely dry before being placed in the water.  These practices will help to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the waterbody.<P>
 
<LI><B>Avoid projects which involve in-water dredging and filling:</B> Dredging and filling may be harmful to fish and their habitat.  If your project involves dredging or filling, you will need a permit.<P>
 
<LI><B>Do not work in the water during the spawning and nursery period for those fish species in your waterbody:</B>  In-water construction activities during spawning and nursery periods could kill eggs and young fish.  If you are planning intensive, in-water construction activities, contact your local MNR district office for details on timing your project to protect fisheries. <P>
