<H1>MARIJUANA DEBATE<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Professor Bruce Singh, head of department of psychiatry, Melbourne University/Royal
Melbourne Hospital, chaired a symposium on marijuana today at the 20th congress
of the CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacolgicum).<BR>
<BR>
Professor Singh said afterwards: &quot;The central issue is whether marijuana
is so toxic to the brain, or is so related to precipitating mental disorders,
that we should or should not decriminalise it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My personal view is that we should move cautiously towards partial
decriminalisation.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If it is illegal, it's hard to mount an appropriate education campaign
about how people already using it should do so. They need to know what is
already known.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we still have much to learn about its possible role in causing
mental disorders or in triggering mental disorders in people predisposed
to them.&quot; <BR>
