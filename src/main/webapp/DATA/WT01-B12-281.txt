<P>

Several Wall Street newsletters are now suggesting that a victory for the Dole-Kemp ticket in the presidential election would boost equity prices by lowering capital gains taxes while increasing long-term bond yields because of investor concerns about a return to large federal budget deficits. 
<P>
While it is natural for investors to be concerned about the budgetary affects of Republican promises to reduce taxes, the history of the past ten years should have demonstrated that it is the nation's savings and investment balance, not just budget deficits, which determine interest rates.  As a result the impact of the  Dole economic program on bond yields will depend upon how it influences the country's private savings behavior and demand for capital, not just the federal government's deficit.  Several factors suggest that the Dole program will have a less damaging impact on either the federal deficit or interest rates than many Wall Street pundits now fear.
<P>
First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts.  This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it.  Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to high deficit fiscal policy. As the ratio of federal debt to GDP is now about 55% compared to 28% when Ronald Reagan became president, the markets will be far less tolerant of large scale fiscal stimulus than they were during the early 1980's
<P>
Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part.  The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending.  Regulatory cost push has played such a major role in driving up business costs during the past three decades that there is a stronger statistical relationship between the number of pages in the federal register and interest rates than between federal deficits and interest rates.  The register peaked at nearly 90,000 pages during the high inflation era of the late 1970's and fell steadily to a trough of 49,000 during the late 1980's.  The Clinton administration has pushed it back to 70,000, so if a Dole White House could reduce it back to Reagan era levels there would be potential benefits for both inflation and interest rates.
<P>
If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing.  But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates.  The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform.
<P>
The overall scope of  the Dole fiscal program is also very modest compared to the tax changes which occurred during the Reagan years.  The Dole program would reduce the top marginal tax rate to 34% whereas during the Reagan years it declined to 28%.  If Congress enacted every tax change proposed by the Dole-Kemp platform without cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus to the economy would be only $58 billion during 1998 compared to a nominal GDP of $8 trillion.  It is also quite likely that the capital gains tax cut would produce such a huge revenue windfall that the federal deficit would shrink during the twelve to twenty four months after the
 enactment of the Dole tax program.  As a result of the equity bull market since 1991, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. is now 95% compared to a previous all time peak of 82% in 1929 and a sixty year moving average of 48%.  If the household sector could realize capital gains with a tax rate of only 14%, there would be a realignment of portfolios on a scale so large that the Treasury would experience a massive revenue windfall.
<P>
Thirdly, the presidential campaign cannot be viewed in isolation from the congressional election campaign.  Under the influence of consultant Richard Morris, the President recast himself as a conservative on many social and economic issues during the first half of 1996 but the Democratic Party in the Congress remains far to the left of the President.  During most of the 20th Century, the Congressional Democratic Party was well balanced between membership from the rural south and the urban northeast and middle west.  During the 1990's, though, the Democratic Party has lost most of its congressional membership in the south and became heavily dependent upon the urban centers of the Northeast, the middle west, and California.  In the House, for example, the Republicans now have 78 of the 125 seats in the old southern confederacy  compared to only 6 in 1960.  As a result of  the pending retirement of many long-term Democratic incumbents, the Republican share of southern seats could easily rise to 90-100 this autumn even if the party loses seats elsewhere in the country.  If the Democratic Party regains control of the House with only 20-30 southern seats, many of their most influential committee chairmen will be far to the left not just of current Republican chairmen but also of previous Democratic chairmen.  The contrast between a house speaker Richard Gephardt and the old Democratic house speaker, Tom Foley, would also be very striking.  After flirting with so-called "new Democrat" themes in the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade to promoting protectionist trade policies and new forms of federal intervention in the economy.  President Clinton  has so far resisted most of the congressional Democrats' economic proposals,  but as a result of his apparent flexibility on many issues, the financial markets are uncertain about how he would manage a more left wing Democratic Congress if he is reelected to a second term.  The great fear haunting the U.S. bond market today is not a Dole-Kemp victory in the Presidential election and the enactment of a modest Republican tax cut program.  It is what would happen to government spending, the cost of federal regulation, and trade policy in the event that the Democrats made a sweep of both the White House and the Congress.  Such a sweep would probably encourage an immediate wave of selling by foreign investors in the U.S. bond market and a slump in the stock markets of emerging market economies sensitive to U.S. trade policy.
