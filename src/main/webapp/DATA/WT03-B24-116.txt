<title> Welcome message, NIS&T Key Escrow Export Meeting, September 1995</title>

Dear Participant:
<p>
<p>
Thank you for agreeing to participate in the two-day
meeting on software key escrow encryption.  We are
anxious to work with you and other industry
representatives to facilitate development of exportable
key escrow encryption in software products.  I look
forward to the workshop being an important step in that
process.
<p>
<p>
I have attached a draft agenda for the two days.  I
propose that we spend the majority of our time discussing
a set of export criteria.  In order to move that
discussion along, a draft set of criteria is attached. 
The criteria state, in general terms, the government's
needs with respect to exportable software, consistent
with its law enforcement and national security
requirements.  Since it is important that the final
criteria be clear, straightforward, consistent, and
implementable, Mike Nelson of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy will spend a few minutes describing
these criteria on the first morning of the meeting. 
After that, we would like to hear your perspectives on
them and work with you to refine them.  On the second
day, we plan to discuss the export licensing process for
such products, and begin exploring characteristics of
acceptable key escrow agents.
<p>
<p>
Again, thank you for your participation.  I look forward
to seeing you there.
<p>
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
/ s /
<p>
<p>
Raymond G. Kammer
Deputy Director
