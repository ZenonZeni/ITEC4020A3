<P><H3><A NAME="A2"><B>H.1 Description of Contract</B></A></H3>


<P>This is a three phase contract to acquire Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) waste acceptance and
transportation services on a privatized basis. The Contractor has been selected as having the
requisite technical, business, and financial capability to perform all three phases. Phase A is a
fixed term, firm-fixed price effort to establish the technical, operational, regulatory, financial,
and planning elements required to provide fixed-unit-priced waste acceptance and transportation
services on a privatized basis. Based upon evaluation of the Contractor's deliverables (criteria
TBD), the Contracting Officer will determine whether to authorize the Contractor to proceed to
perform Phase B and to subsequently authorize the Contractor to proceed to perform Phase C.
Phase B work, which would begin approximately 17 months after the award of Phase A, consists
of the design, permitting, institutional outreach to states, tribes, local governments and interested
parties, hardware acquisition, and mobilization necessary to startup waste acceptance and
transportation of SNF operations. Phase C work consists of waste acceptance and transportation
of SNF to a Federal Facility and delivery of storage hardware at fixed unit prices (which include
costs of performing Phase B work) utilizing facilities and equipment that are developed,
financed, permitted, constructed, owned, operated, and deactivated by the Contractor.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="A3"><B>H.2 Obligation of Funds</B></A></H3>


<P><DL><DD> a. The amount of funds obligated to this Contract with respect to the work
covered by Phase A is <U> $ TBD </U>.
<P><DD> b. Phases B and C of this Contract will be incrementally funded. Such funds may be
unilaterally increased by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 
<P><DL><DD> 1) DOE's obligation to make payment under this Contract is contingent upon
the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for Contract purposes can be legally
made. No legal liability on the part of DOE for any payment, termination liability, or other
contractual requirement may arise from performance under this Contract unless and until funds
are made available and obligated to this Contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such
availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
<P><DD> 2) DOE will make its best efforts to obligate funds to the Contract after Congressional
authorization and appropriation, and the allotment is received by DOE. DOE intends to obligate
funds to the Contract incrementally as necessary to meet or exceed any annual termination
liability (see Clause H.17, Termination Settlement) and performance payment requirements.
However, nothing in this contract shall be considered to bind or otherwise obligate the Congress
to appropriate funds sufficient to cover contract requirements.
<P><DD> 3) During Phase B, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in
writing whenever it has reason to believe that the payments due from DOE under this Contract in
the event of a termination for convenience will result in an amount due from DOE which exceeds
the amount obligated under this Contract pursuant to this Clause H.2.
<P><DD> 4) During Phase C, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing
whenever it has reason to believe that the payments due from DOE under this Contract in the
next 60 days, when added to all payments previously made and the amount that would be due in
the event of a termination for convenience, will, in the event of a termination for convenience,
result in an amount to be due from DOE which exceeds the amount obligated under this Contract
pursuant to this Clause H.2. Such notice shall, as a minimum, identify 1)payments made to date;
2)nature and amount of expected payments to the point of exceeding amounts obligated; and
3)payments for the remaining portion of DOE's fiscal year. 
<P><DD> 5) In the event that DOE does not obligate sufficient funds to fulfill its legal
obligations during Phase B and C, the Contractor shall have no further obligation to continue
performance and the continuance of such performance shall be at the Contractor's own risk. DOE
will advise the Contractor, within a reasonable time, of its intentions and expectations regarding
further obligation of funds, provided, however, that a delay in obligating additional funds for
performance of more than 120 days (or such other period as may be mutually agreed upon) will
result in a termination for convenience. 
<P><DD> 6) If, solely by reason of failure of DOE to obligate additional funds in amounts
sufficient for timely performance of the contract, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is
delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are obligated,
an equitable adjustment will be made in the contract prices, or in the time of delivery, or both.
Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute within the meaning
of FAR
<P></DL></DL>

<H3><A NAME="A4"><B>H.3 Payments For Completed Work</B></A></H3>

<P>DOE will pay the Contractor, upon the submission of proper invoices or vouchers, the prices
stipulated in this Contract for completed work in accordance with the following: 
<P><DL><DD> a. For Phase A, a single payment at the end of Phase A will be made after
receipt and acceptance of all deliverables in accordance with the requirements of Section C,
<I>Statement of Work</I>, and Section E,<I> Inspection and Acceptance</I>.
<P><DD> b. There will be no payment for Phase B work. However, the Contractor's costs of
performing the Phase B work may be recovered in the Contractor's Phase C fixed unit prices. 
<P><DD> c. For Phase C work, payment will be made in accordance with the requirements of
Section C, <I>Statement of Work</I>, and Section E, <I>Inspection and Acceptance</I>.
Contractor invoices for payment may be submitted no more frequently than monthly.
<P></DL>


<H3><A NAME="A5"><B>H.4 Payment Pending Resolution of Contested
Claim</B></A></H3>


<P>In order to ensure that the Contractor is promptly compensated for all work that has been
satisfactorily performed and accepted by DOE, DOE will pay the uncontested portion of any
properly submitted claim, invoice, or other payment made in accordance with the terms of this
Contract.
<P>

of the Index.
<P><DD> ECI<SUB>fgb</SUB> shall be the value for the index for the base period [TBD] 
<P></DL><DD> d. The Contractor agrees that, in the event that any of the indices utilized herein
are removed from publication, negotiations will be conducted to select an alternate published
index as nearly identical in scope and content as possible to the original index.

work and so notifies the Contractor in writing, the Contractor shall commence such performance
in accordance with said notice and diligently prosecute said work in accordance with this
Contract.

not be deemed a breach of Contract or a termination for the convenience of the Government, and
the Contractor's only entitlement shall be to receive payment of the Contract price for CLIN 1
upon delivery and acceptance of all Phasedeliverables. If DOE has not authorized the Contractor
to proceed beyond Phase A within approximately seventeen months after Contract award, the
Contract will be deemed to have been completed on that date. Failure to authorize a Contractor to
proceed beyond Phase A shall not be subject to protest before DOE or the General Accounting
Office or under the Disputes Clause.
