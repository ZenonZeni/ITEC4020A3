<B>1996 Moose Hunting Season
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Hunters are reminded that applications for the adult moose hunt validation tag draw must be received no later than 4:30 p.m., May 15, 1996, and that a valid Outdoors Card is required to enter the tag draw.<P>

The number of tags in some Wildlife Management Units has been reduced this year.  However, some WMUs are in a position to offer more tags than last year.<P>

The largest reduction in the number of tags issued has taken place in WMU 35, in an area north of Sault Ste. Marie District.  This is because of a decline in the moose population coupled with a greater than planned harvest of bull moose in 1995.  For similar reasons other WMUs, including 13, 15B and 21A in Thunder Bay District, have seen a smaller number of tags issued than WMU 35.<P>

Areas where an increase has occurred this year include WMU 42, in North Bay District, where the number of tags is up to 105 in 1996 from 65 in 1995, and WMU 47, in Parry Sound District, where the number of tags jumped to 340 from 230.<P>

For more information, hunters can obtain a copy of the 1996 Moose Hunter's Fact Sheet at all licence issuers and local MNR offices.<P>

Outdoors Card holders are required to submit renewals at least three weeks before the May 15 adult moose validation tag draw deadline to avoid delays and help ensure they receive a new card in time to participate in the draw.  Cards can be renewed by mail or by calling the automated Outdoors Card renewal hot line, at  1-800-288-1155.  The fastest method is to renew by phone.<P>
