<p> <b>DRUG OFFENSES ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF JAIL
INMATES</b> </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h1>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Drug offenses accounted for 23 percent of </p>

<p> the charges against the almost 400,000 men and women being
held in </p>

<p> local jails during 1989--up from 9 percent in 1983, the
Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Statistics announced today. The Bureau, a component
of the </p>

<p> Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice,
reported </p>

<p> that the number of inmates in the nation's 3,312 local jails
grew 77 </p>

<p> percent from 1983 to 1989. More than 40 percent of that
growth </p>

<p> resulted from the increased number of persons held for or
convicted of </p>

<p> drug offenses. </p>

<p> &quot;The dramatic increase in the number of persons in jails
on </p>

<p> drug charges occurred both among those awaiting trial and
those </p>

<p> already convicted of crimes,&quot; said Bureau Director
Steven D. </p>

<p> Dillingham. &quot;And more than one-half of all convicted
jail inmates </p>

<p> said they had committed the offense for which they were
incarcerated </p>

<p> under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both.&quot; </p>

<p> The findings were drawn from a nationally representative </p>

<p> survey of 5,675 inmates held in 424 local jails. Similar
Bureau </p>

<p> surveys of jail inmates were conducted in 1972, 1978 and
1983. A jail </p>

<p> is a locally administered institution that holds people
awaiting trial </p>

<p> or already sentenced, usually for one year or less. </p>

<p> About half of all jail inmates in 1989 had been convicted and
</p>

<p> were serving time, 7 percent had been convicted but not yet
sentenced, </p>

<p> 26 percent were awaiting or on trial and 16 percent were
awaiting </p>

<p> arraignment. </p>

<p> An estimated 46 percent of the jail inmates in 1989 were on </p>

<p> probation, on parole, on bail or were in some other criminal
justice </p>

<p> status at the time of their arrest. More than three-quarters
of all </p>

<p> inmates being held in 1989 for any offense had had a prior
sentence of </p>

<p> probation or incarceration. At least a third of the inmates
were in </p>

<p> jail for a violent offense or had been previously sentenced
for a </p>

<p> violent offense. Other survey results: </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 convicted inmates said they had </p>

<p> been using an illegal drug during the month before they
committed the </p>

<p> offense for which they were incarcerated. About one in four
convicted </p>

<p> inmates said they had used a major drug, such as heroin,
cocaine, </p>

<p> crack, LSD or PCP, in that month. </p>

<p> --Women and Hispanic prisoners were the most likely among all
</p>

<p> jail inmates to be held on drug charges--about one-third in
each </p>

<p> group. </p>

<p> --Among convicted inmates, 29 percent reported they had </p>

<p> committed their offenses under the influence of only alcohol,
15 </p>

<p> percent under the influence of only drugs and 12 percent
under the </p>

<p> influence of both. </p>

<p> --Almost one-third of all jail inmates said they had </p>

<p> participated in a substance abuse treatment program at some
time in </p>

<p> their lives--about 18 percent of the inmates had received
treatment </p>

<p> for drugs, 9 percent for alcohol and 6 percent for both. </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 female inmates reported they had
</p>

<p> been abused at some time before their current
incarceration--33 </p>

<p> percent physically and 36 percent sexually. </p>

<p> --About 39 percent of all jail inmates had grown up in a </p>

<p> single parent household and an additional 11 percent had
lived in a </p>

<p> household without either parent. </p>

<p> --The racial and ethnic composition of local jails changed </p>

<p> between 1983 and 1989--blacks increased from 38 percent to 42
percent </p>

<p> of the inmates population, Hispanics increased from 14
percent to 17 </p>

<p> percent and the percentage of white non-Hispanics decreased
from 46 </p>

<p> percent to 39 percent. </p>

<p> --The female jail population increased from 7.1 percent in </p>

<p> 1983 to 9.5 percent in 1989. One of every four female inmates
was in </p>

<p> jail for larceny or fraud. </p>

<p> --About 11 percent of the inmates were being held for other </p>

<p> authorities--most awaiting transportation to a state prison. </p>

<p> --Among the inmates who had been sentenced to serve their
time </p>

<p> in local jails, half had received a sentence of six months of
less. </p>

<p> It is estimated that about half of the inmates sentenced to
local </p>

<p> jails would serve less than five months. </p>
