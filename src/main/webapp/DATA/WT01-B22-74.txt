<h1>A SHORT HEMP HISTORY, </h1>

<p><b>The Story you were never told in school</b> </p>

<p>The World History of Commercial Cannabis Hemp or Marijuana
Cannabis Hemp has a history that goes back to pre-historic time. </p>

<p>Cannabis Hemp has been found in Tombs dating back to 8,000 B.
C. </p>

<p>Hemp Travels The World: </p>

<p>1. 8500BC China 2. 1000BC India </p>

<p>3. 500BC Africa - Asia 4. 500AD Europe </p>

<p>5. 1495 N America 6. 1545 S America </p>

<p>7. 1992 Australia 8. 1993 England </p>

<p>Cannabis use can be documented as far back as 2700 BC (1) in
ancient Chinese writings. These writings tell us that cannabis
was used by the Chinese for a variety of uses. These included
fiber, oil, and as a medicine. By 450 BC history tells us that
hemp was being cultivated in the Mid-East region. From
Afghanistan to Egypt hemp was cultivated for its fiber and drugs.
It appears that hemp was first introduced into Europe around
500-1000 AD. It is known that hemp was in wide cultivation in
Europe by the Sixteenth century. It was cultivated for its fiber
and its seed. The seed was cooked with barley and other grains
and eaten. In 1537 Dioscorides called the plant Cannabis Sativa,
the scientific name that stands today as its true name. He noted
its use in &quot;the stoutest cords&quot; and also its medicinal
properties (2). </p>

<p>Hemp was introduced into Chile about 1545 (3) where it was
grown for fiber. Hemp was introduced in New England soon after
Puritan Immigrants settled, noting that it grew &quot;twice so </p>

<p>high&quot;(4). In Virginia the early legislature passed many
acts to promote the hemp industry. Before the revolution hemp
seems to have flourished in the area around Lancaster PA. Hemp
was first grown in Kentucky in 1775 (5). In 1802 two extensive
Ropewalks were built in Lexington Kentucky. There was also
announced a machine that could break &quot;eight thousand weight
of hemp per day&quot;(6), a huge quantity for the time. Hemp
spread to other states including Missouri by 1835, </p>

<p>Champaign IL by 1875, Nebraska by 1887, California by 1912
(7), Minnesota by 1880 (8), Wisconsin and Iowa by the early
1920Us. The cultivation of hemp was stalled by federal action in
1937 by the imposition of a heavy tax on producers known as the
Marijuana Tax Act. By 1940 the US government reduced the tax so
production could take place during WW II. After WW II, with the
heavy tax, cultivation declined until 1968 when the last legal
crop was grown in Minnesota (9). </p>
