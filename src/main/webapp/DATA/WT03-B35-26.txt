SPOT U PRICE IN U.S. RISES ABRUPTLY; DOC CLEARS ENTERGY LEU SHIPMENT

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington; Ray Silver, Toronto; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

The spot uranium price in the U.S. rose in the last weeks in December. The
Uranium Exchange Co. raised its spot U3O8 price to $12.10 per pound on
December 18; Washington Nuclear Corp. raised its U3O8 price December 21 to
$12.50/lb. Some analysts thought that latter figure was high, but most
agreed that the market was clearly trending upward.
   In deals completed before the holidays, Cameco apparently selected
several suppliers to fill its request for offers for 700,000 U3O8, but will
probably not buy the entire amount. The mining company, sources said,
didn't see any offers below $12/lb and will probably buy much of the
material at a price around $12.25/lb, plus or minus 10 cents. Some offers
reportedly as high as $12.50/lb were considered, but several others with
prices a $1 or so higher than that were dismissed.
   British Nuclear Fuels reportedly also selected more than one supplier,
reportedly for more than 200,000 lb U3O8. One source suggested that the
company may have bought as much as 500,000 lb U3O8 equivalent at prices
ranging from $12.20/lb to slightly above $12.40/lb.
   San Diego Gas & Electric is said to have selected a supplier for U3O8.
(The utility had been looking for offers to supply 223,000 lb.) The price
is said to be at or slightly above $11.85/lb, the TradeTech value at the
end of November. Said one source, ``San Diego and Wisconsin Public Service
(which is still evaluating offers) may have seen the last of the
under-$12/lb uranium.''
   At press time there was a report that Consumers Power was out looking
for a supply of 600,000 lb U3O8.
   Fermco, the company in charge of cleaning up the DOE defense facility at
Fernald in Ohio, solicited offers last month for the purchase 484,061 lb of
excess normal uranium, which is in various forms including derbies, ingots,
recyclable metal, and UF4. The minimum acceptable price, the solicitation
said, was $2.04/lb--$1.36/lb for the material and $0.68/lb for analysis,
handling, and packaging. Bids were due December 20. According to sources,
Fermco received expressions of interest from four companies.
   In NuclearFuel's judgment, significant open-market transactions in the
U.S. during the forward two-week period could be concluded within the range
of $12.00-$12.40/lb U3O8, a rise from the range reported two weeks ago of
$11.80-$12.10/lb. So-called unrestricted buyers, those able to use uranium
from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), could probably conclude
a deal within the range of $10.00-$10.30/lb, a slight rise in the range
reported two weeks ago of $9.90-$10.20/lb.

DOC Clears Import Of Entergy LEU
   A shipment of low-enriched uranium (LEU) destined for use in one of
Entergy's reactors was finally released December 21 by the U.S. Customs
Service after the import was cleared by the Department of Commerce. The
material, enriched at Eurodif and imported by Cogema Inc., contained
uranium originally from Kazakstan and/or Uzbekistan. Sources said DOC
cleared the shipment after Entergy agreed to match an equal quantity of the
uranium with newly produced U.S. uranium. Neither DOC nor Entergy officials
were available to confirm that report, however.
   Under the terms of the antidumping suspension agreements with those
countries, the origin of the uranium does not change when it is enriched in
a third country and therefore, the uranium can only be imported right now
into the U.S. under the quota systems in both suspension agreements.
   Joseph Spetrini, DOC deputy assistant secretary for import
administration, has been trying to negotiate an agreement to grandfather
some of the so-called bypass Uzbek and Kazak uranium. In October, Spetrini
proposed to grandfather 75% of the uranium utilities contracted for before
March 27, the date the Kazak agreement was signed. The remaining 25% could
come in if the utilities matched the uranium with newly produced U.S.
uranium. The mining company petitioners, including Cogema Inc.'s Pathfinder
Mines, protested to Spetrini and told him that they would agree to
grandfathering only under certain conditions.
   Spetrini found himself in a bind and, according to one source, was
facing the threat of a lawsuit by Entergy if the shipment was not cleared.
   (Washington Nuclear reported that Customs cleared the five containers of
Entergy's LEU that had been held up at Portsmouth, Va. since December 8.)
   On the Entergy shipment, DOC, according to one source, ``used chewing
gum to patch together'' the settlement, allowing Commerce to make the call
to Customs to clear the shipment. The mining companies apparently didn't
agree to the settlement and still maintain that there is no legal basis to
let the uranium in.

Miners' Conditions For Grandfathering
   The ad hoc group of U.S. uranium mining companies, petitioners in the
antidumping cases, submitted a confidential set of conditions that they say
must be met for them to agree to any grandfathering of Uzbek or Kazak
uranium (NF, 18 Dec. '95, 2). The miners say these conditions represent ``a
firm position of industry.'' Among the conditions, sources said, are the
following: The quantity of grandfathered material is not to exceed
9.5-million lb; the material to be allowed in without restrictions must be
only 75% of the nominal quantity contracted for; the matched sales to allow
import of the remaining 25% must be done by June 30 and must be matched
with newly produced U.S. uranium; the utility contracts for the purchase of
Uzbek or Kazak uranium concluded after March 27 and those not brought to
DOC's attention in response to September 22 Federal Register notice would
not be eligible for grandfathering; and the DOC must reverse its
interpretation of the Uzbek agreement--and an interpretation that allows
for a doubling quota amount to 1.88-million lb U3O8 per year after 1996.
   ``There are limits to industry's willingness to accept mechanisms which
will flood the U.S. market with dumped CIS uranium,'' the miners said.
``Those limits have been reached.''

Australian Analysts See $14.25/lb U Price in 1996
   Analyst Daniel Stubbs of the Australian Bureau of Agriculture & Resource
Economics is predicting that the average spot uranium price will rise to
(US)$14.25/lb U3O8 in 1996 from $11.50/lb in 1995. Stubbs and fellow
analyst Charles Millsteed are predicting that in the longer term, the spot
price will increase to $19.70/lb ($17/lb in 1995 dollars) by the end of
2000. Rising prices will lead to increased production from Australia's two
operating companies--Energy Resources of Australia and Western Mining Corp.
The cost of production in Australian uranium mines is estimated to be in
the range of $10-$15/lb U3O8. Production is expected to rise from 4,700
metric tons U3O8 to 6,300 MT in 1999-2000, the analysts say. The articles
about uranium appeared in the December 1995 issue of the journal Australian
Commodities.

INI: Price Spike In 1998, But Softening Thereafter
   International Nuclear Inc. (INI), whose president is ex-Nuexco analyst
David Schramm, has recently completed an analysis of the market that
forecasts a spot market price spike by 1998, but with the price softening
after that. INI says it believes the spot price in constant 1995 dollars
will be in the $16.50 range by 1998 but will fall by the year 2000 to
around $14.80/lb U3O8. The spiking will occur, INI believes, because of
pressure to produce more uranium as utility stocks get used up over the
next two years. The softening will occur, however, as more blended-down HEU
enters the market under the formula called for in the pending U.S.
Enrichment Corp. privatization bill and as more uranium enters the U.S.
from Kazakstan and Uzbekistan under their suspension agreement quotas, INI
believes. INI, as do most analysts, foresees essentially flat requirements
over the next five years.
   INI also believes there could be a rising premium for longer-term
contracts, and it forecasts a base price for those types of contracts in
the mid-$18/lb range by 1998.

ESA Advisory Group Elects New Officers
   The Euratom Supply Agency's advisory group met last month to elect new
officers and hear updates on various items of interest, but took no new
initiatives, participants reported.
   Elected chairman was Jose-Luis Gonzalez of Enusa; new vice chairmen are
Stig Sandklef of Vattenfall Fuel and H. Blackwell Gresley of Urenco Ltd.
   The committee heard a brief report on the U.S.-Euratom agreement for
nuclear cooperation, now under review by the U.S. Congress, and on
relations with Russia and the ex-Soviet republics that export uranium, but
a source said there is ``nothing new'' in the latter field. The committee
will have to tackle the issue during the coming year, to define whether and
how the ESA's ``common policy'' of limiting nuclear materials imports from
Russia must change when the overall European Union-Russian Federation
partnership and cooperation agreement enters into force, in principle on
January 1, 1997. The agreement calls for free trade between the two parties
on that date, but the EU insisted on a potential exemption for nuclear
trade if the required market conditions are not fulfilled.

Linder Fund Buys More Stock In URI
   Uranium Resources announced December 26 that one of its largest
stockholders--the Linder Dividend Fund Inc.--had exercised it rights under
a May 1995 warrant agreement to buy more common stock in the company. The
exercise of 500,000 warrants will infuse the company with $2-million in
working capital for project development and other purposes.
   URI said that it expects production to begin at its Kingsville Dome site
late in the first quarter. Combined with production from Rosita, URI said
it expects to produce more than 2-million lb in 1996. In 1995, URI said
610,000 lb U3O8 were produced at Rosita.
   URI's stock closed December 26 at 5 3/8, with 16,800 shares being
traded. Its 52-week high was 8 5/8.

Court Okays Denison Restructure
   Four days before Christmas, Denison Mines President Bill James announced
a new deal for shareholders who have been in financial limbo for four years
since Ontario Hydro canceled its long-term commitment to buy 100-million lb
of high-cost Elliot Lake uranium. With final approval from the Ontario
Court of Justice, General Division, James said the company could proceed
with a restructuring plan that will reclassify existing Class A, Class B
and preferred shares into new common shares. The new shares should be
listed for trading on Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges by January 3, he
said.
   ``It has been a long road and all stakeholders have paid a price. The
(federal and Ontario) governments have provided interest relief on taxes
and a postponement of taxes payable; corporate lenders and Canada Mortgage
& Housing Corp. have given interest, principal and repayment concessions;
preferred shareholders have agreed to eliminate a large amount of dividends
in arrears and their priority on liquidation; Class A and Class B
shareholders have accepted a significant dilution of their equity
interest,'' James explained. The provincial government have made
concessions in exchange for assurance that decommissioning of Denison
Mines' Elliot Lake mine-mill facility would be completed.
   ``As a result of the stakeholders contributions, Denison has been
preserved as a going concern and its capital structure have been
substantially improved,'' James noted.

Czech Deal With Cameco
   The first company in Eastern Europe to take its uranium conversion
business to Canada, the Czech electric power utility CEZ has contracted
with Cameco Corp. for conversion services at Port Hope, Ontario. Noting
that the Soviet Union previously met such nuclear fuel demands, Cameco
Chairman and President Bernard Michel said the CEZ deal ``reflects the
changing global marketplace as Eastern European countries open their doors
to Western business.'' Cameco would not say how much uranium would be
involved nor the dollar value of the CEZ contract.

MINATOM OFFICIAL CALLS FOR MAKE-OR-BREAK DECISION ON KRASNOYARSK RT-2
PLANT

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   Prospects for completing the RT-2 reprocessing plant at Krasnoyarsk-26
are bleak, according to a key official at the Russian Ministry of Atomic
Energy (Minatom).
   RT-2, with a design throughput of 1,500 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM)
per year, was supposed to reprocess spent fuel from VVER-1000 plants.
Construction began in 1987 but was stopped two years later for lack of
funds (NF, 4 Jan. '89, 5). Meanwhile, spent fuel is being stored at
reactors and at an interim storage facility adjacent to the RT-2
construction site at Krasnoyarsk-26.
   Evgeny Mikerin, who heads up nuclear fuel production at Minatom, said
last month the plant is about 30% complete. Since 1989, the project has
been modified to include design innovations, including safety improvements
in the aftermath of an explosion at a separation plant at Tomsk-7 (NF, 12
April '93, 1). If construction were to resume now, Mikerin said, RT-2 could
be completed by the end of 2003.
   Construction cannot proceed, however, until regulator Gosatomnadzor and
local authorities review reports required under Russia's new nuclear
licensing laws, passed in mid-1995. Mikerin said Minatom anticipates
difficulties in getting all consulting experts to agree on the contents of
an ecological report that must be submitted to licensing authorities.
   In the meantime, Mikerin said, Minatom has not appropriated any
construction funding for the project. Russian media reported in early 1995
that following a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to complete
RT-2, that the central government, Minatom, and local and regional
authorities earmarked more than $100-million for the project. But Mikerin
said those reports were false.
   ``There is no money for RT-2 beyond the small amounts required to
maintain the infrastructure already there,'' he said. Mikerin added that,
because construction on the Siberian site had started nearly 10 years ago,
infrastructure maintenance must be funded at a higher level now in order to
prevent the equipment from deteriorating.

Taiwan, ROK Won't Take Back HLW
   There also is no longer an agreement inside the Russian administration
on the project's cost. Mikerin said that while costs associated with RT-1
have been rising, cost estimates for the construction and operation of RT-2
also have increased. But, he said, ``the government has taken no decision
on this as of yet.''
   He said Minatom still is looking for foreign partners wanting to
reprocess fuel at RT-2 ``because we cannot continue to depend upon
government support.'' Mikerin said on December 5, ``As of today, all those
(parties) we have discussed the project with have declined'' to be
involved.
   Mikerin confirmed that utilities in Germany and Switzerland have
formally declined to consider a reprocessing joint venture at
Krasnoyarsk-26. He said that talks also had been held with utilities in
Taiwan and the Republic of Korea (ROK). Those potential clients have not
categorically withdrawn from the talks, Mikerin said. But the two Asian
states are not yet willing to take back high-level reprocessing waste
(HLW), he added. That takeback is now required by Russian law.
   Mikerin also contradicted speculation that Japan, as part of an ongoing
review of its own reprocessing expansion program, might fund completion of
RT-2 to reprocess Japanese spent fuel. The Minatom official said that
nuclear political relations between Tokyo and Moscow are ``not good'' and
are hampered by a long-running dispute about Russian Navy low-level waste
dumping off Russia's Pacific Coast. Under these circumstances, he said, it
is not possible to strike a deal with Japan involving RT-2.
   Mikerin acknowledged that the slow pace of Minatom's nuclear power
development program since the Chernobyl accident in 1986 now poses problems
for the economics of the reprocessing project. At 1,500 MTHM/yr, RT-2 was
designed to be much too large for the current projected demand.
   ``It's time to make hard decisions about RT-2'' Mikerin said. ``If we
want to finish it, we should find the money and do so--now. If not, we
should give it up.''
   The interim storage facility at Krasnoyarsk-26 for VVER-1000 spent fuel
is 15% full, Mikerin said, compared to 13% at the end of 1994.
   As a result of a government-to-government agreement with Ukraine, about
half the spent fuel to be added to the storage facility will come from
VVER-1000 units in Ukraine, he said.
   Following a commercial contract two years ago, Ukraine is trying to pay
for the storage of its spent fuel at Krasnoyarsk-26. About half of the
payments it makes to Minatom are in cash. The rest are in barter, mostly in
food and stainless steel tubing provided in advance for RT-2, as well as
zirconium and a small amount of uranium ore.
   While RT-2 could be ready in eight years if approved and funded, Minatom
officials said, without foreign help, it will take longer for Russia to
digest the plutonium output of the plant in the form of plutonium-uranium
fuel.
   So far, Mikerin said, an experimental fabrication line for
plutonium-based fast reactor fuel at Chelyabinsk-65 has produced only two
to three assemblies per year. They have been loaded into the BN-600 fast
reactor at Beloyarsk, near Ekaterinburg. The reactor, like most other
Soviet-design fast reactors, has traditionally operated on uranium fuel
enriched to up to 25% U-235.

LA HAGUE SITE REACHES NOMINAL PRODUCTION; MELOX GEARS UP

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Cogema's La Hague reprocessing site reached its nominal capacity for the
first time in 1995, processing some 1,550 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM),
despite the labor unrest that slowed production in June, said Jean-Louis
Ricaud, the company's reprocessing chief.
   The UP3 plant that reprocesses foreign reactor fuel was commissioned in
1990 but reached its nominal capacity of 800 MTHM/year five years later.
UP2-800, commissioned in August 1994, took less than a year to reach the
same target, Cogema officials point out, saying this demonstrates the
company's mastery of the industrial process.
   Ricaud said that Cogema's mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication complex
also is gearing up, with the refurbished Cadarache MOX plant having
manufactured more than 30 MTHM of fuel for Electricite de France (EDF) in
1995.
   The much bigger Melox MOX plant at Marcoule produced low-enrichment and
medium-enrichment MOX pins last year, but complete fuel assemblies included
high-enrichment pins made in Cadarache, he said. About 70-75 fuel
assemblies were produced at the plant, or 20 MTHM equivalent of MOX fuel.
   But Melox will really begin full production in 1996, Ricaud said. ``We
are confident that the plant will be able to deliver 85 tons to EDF in 1996
with the label `Made in Melox,' as scheduled,'' he said.
   The nominal capacity of Melox is 120 MTHM/year. Cogema has announced
plans to increase that to 160 MTHM/year in the near term.

BNFL TAPS EXXON CHEMICAL VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SLOT

   British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) has confirmed the appointment of
international chemical industry executive John Taylor as its new chief
executive. His appointment will go into effect in March.
   Taylor, currently a vice president of Brussels-based Exxon Chemical
Europe Inc., replaces Neville Chamberlain. Last month Chamberlain left that
post for a promotion as deputy chairman of BNFL (NF, 4 Dec. '95, 11).
Chamberlain is combining both roles until Taylor's installation.
   BNFL is beefing up its top management in efforts to maximize overseas
opportunities. Taylor, 48, has been with Exxon Chemical for 26 years,
holding a number of senior international management positions in the U.K.,
U.S. and Belgium.
   Taylor said that BNFL's improved safety and environmental performance,
coupled with recent successes in winning international business, made it an
``exciting time...to move the company forward.'' BNFL was recently named
the U.K.'s fastest growing large exporter (NF, 23 Oct. '95, 8).
   Taylor's appointment coincided with BNFL's announcement that site work
has started on a revolutionary 360-million-pound (U.S.$560-million) plant
to treat intermediate-level radioactive waste (ILW). The plant is expected
to cut 500-million pounds from the lifetime costs of BNFL's ILW program and
to attract international business with its state-of-the-art technology.
   The Sellafield Drypac plant, scheduled to come on line in 2002, will
convert wet ILW into dry material that can be compacted, mixed with
concrete, and packed in 500-liter stainless steel containers. Main building
and civil contract work on the plant is due to start April 1997.

YEAR LATER PASSAGE OF WASTE BILL REMAINS AN INDUSTRY TOP PRIORITY

   The nuclear power industry has no ``Plan B'' up its sleeve in the event
nuclear waste legislation does not pass this year, said Joseph Colvin,
executive vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
   ``There is a strong consensus across the nation this needs to be done,''
he said.
   A year after the industry trade association set waste legislation as its
top priority for 1995, a congressional fix of the faltering DOE waste
program still has top billing. But Colvin remains optimistic that can be
accomplished.
   Even as the Upton-Towns nuclear waste bill, H.R. 1020, became bogged
down in congressional budget battles on Capitol Hill, it remained one of
the strongest bipartisan bills making its way through the legislative
process, he said. Supported by the Republican leadership and such
influential Democrats as Reps. John Dingell of Michigan and Frank Pallone
Jr. of New Jersey, the bill has a hefty list of supporters.
   More than 230 members of the House are ready to move on the bill,
according to Colvin.

Breaking The `Scoring' Logjam
   NEI has sent suggested solutions to the House Commerce Committee in an
effort to break the ``scoring'' logjam that prevented the bill from moving
to the floor in 1995. Earlier Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich
(R-Ohio) had warned that the user fee provisions in the bill would require
about $4.2-billion in new offsetting budget cuts.
   Under H.R. 1020, money collected from nuclear utility ratepayers to fund
the DOE waste program would be limited to the amount the program spent the
year before. The provisions would eliminate the hundreds of millions of
dollars in surplus fees collected from ratepayers each year that are
scored, or counted against the federal budget.
   Colvin said that doing away with the new railroad spur called for in
H.R. 1020 would save $1-billion. That, coupled with the one-time payments
utilities are required to make to the DOE program, would put the scoring
difference at less than $1-billion, he said.
   He noted that NEI still has a lot more to do in working with the Senate
leadership on fixing the waste program. Sen. Larry Craig's (R-Idaho) S.
1271 is the companion to H.R. 1020 and will be tackled this year.
   Timing will be everything in both chambers. Colvin said NEI is
optimistic about getting a bill through the Senate early in the year,
before the political pressure of the presidential election year gets too
high. He noted there was no magic cutoff point for passing nuclear waste
legislation, but that the longer that effort dragged on the more difficult
it would be.

Increasing Industry Role
   The role the nuclear industry will have in the DOE waste program is
expected to increase in 1996. Colvin said that DOE is expected to issue a
request for proposals early in the year, seeking private sector involvement
or input on spent fuel transportation.
   DOE program director Daniel Dreyfus has noted that budget cuts would
force DOE to turn that work over to the private sector. The department also
will be terminating its multipurpose canister (MPC) program, also leaving
that work up to the private sector.
   Colvin said NEI plans to play a key role in the private-sector
development of spent fuel canisters that can be used to store, ship, and
ultimately bury the waste. NEI will be a key coordinator of work and is
expected to outline utility specifications for the canisters, much like
what the industry did for advanced light water reactor requirements through
the Electric Power Research Institute.
   ``Clearly NEI will have some type of catalyst role,'' said Colvin.

HOLTEC, SIERRA NUCLEAR, AND SEG-VECTRA MAKE MESCALERO PROJECT SHORT LIST

By:
Elaine Hiruo, Washington

   Three dry storage teams made it to the Mescalero project's short list
last month, keeping them in the running as potential suppliers for the
commercial spent fuel storage business planned for Mescalero tribal land in
New Mexico. Final selection is expected early this year.
   On the short list are Holtec International, Sierra Nuclear, and a team
made up of Westinghouse subsidiary SEG and Vectra Technologies Inc.
   A contract with the Mescalero-utility project could open doors
elsewhere. Northern States Power Co. (NSP), for example, is the lead
utility in the project and will only consider storage technologies tapped
for the Mescalero venture when it develops its own away-from-reactor
storage facility.
   Under Minnesota law, the utility must look for sites elsewhere in
Goodhue County, away from the Mississippi River, to store Prairie Island
spent fuel. The plant is in Goodhue County near the river. Jim Alders, NSP
manager of regulatory projects, said last week that the storage capacity at
the away-from-reactor site will be limited to 680 fuel assemblies.
   NSP, he said, expects to receive vendor bids in mid-January and to
select the winning technology by mid-March. The utility plans to submit a
license application to the NRC in October.
   Public opposition, meanwhile, is mounting against attempts to move
Prairie Island spent fuel away from the reactor site. A citizens advisory
group's draft report now circulating recommends that the state scrap plans
for an away-from-reactor storage facility, said Alders. The group is
scheduled to submit its final report to the Minnesota Environmental Quality
Board in mid-January.
   Alders said he did not know if a board decision to leave spent fuel at
Prairie Island would put the issue back in the lap of the Minnesota
legislature.
   Meanwhile, dry storage vendors expect the Mescalero Apache Tribe and its
utility partners to select more than one technology for the spent fuel
storage facility planned for New Mexico. The project is aimed at providing
limited storage relief to participating utilities, which feel they can no
longer rely solely on the faltering DOE nuclear waste program.
   The commercial venture is slated to have enough storage capacity to
handle 20,000 metric tons uranium of spent fuel. It will be built and
operated as a business, with an operating life of no more than 40 years.
   The short-listed companies already have links to utilities participating
in the project. Holtec, for instance, earlier sold its canister-based spent
fuel storage system to Commonwealth Edison, the largest nuclear utility in
the U.S. and a member of the Mescalero project. Sierra Nuclear and Vectra
storage systems, likewise, have been purchased by other project members.

IN MATTER OF YEARS, DOE STANCE SHIFTS FROM `OBLIGATION' TO NO CLEAR LEGAL
DUTY

   In 1984, DOE correspondence on the department's accepting utility spent
fuel in 1998 was peppered with such phrases as ``legal obligations.''
Despite being called for in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and in
contracts DOE signed with utilities, by 1993 those phrases were gone, and
DOE officials maintained they didn't have a clear legal obligation to take
the spent fuel by the 1998 contract date if DOE failed to have a place to
put the waste.
   Attorneys for states and nuclear utilities suing the department over its
1998 responsibility have submitted DOE correspondence to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that appears to show an
evolving policy. Plaintiffs in the case have asked the court to reinforce
what they consider a binding DOE obligation to begin taking utility spent
fuel by January 31, 1998.
   Oral arguments are slated for January 17.
   The following are excerpts from DOE correspondence in the joint appendix
plaintiffs' attorneys filed with the court or in DOE's response to a
Freedom of Information request.

May 30, 1984 letter from DOE General Counsel Theodore Garrish to Sen.
Bennett Johnston (D-La.), ranking Democrat on the Energy & Natural
Resources Committee:
   ``The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 was passed with the presumption
that a repository would be operational by January 31, 1998. The Department
fully intends to meet this congressional objective and is currently in the
process of taking the steps necessary to ensure that we fulfill all of our
corresponding legal obligations under the act....
   ``We believe the intent of Congress when formulating the act was
directed toward commencing disposal operations by 1998. The Department is
totally committed to achieving this objective. In light of this commitment,
we are not now in a position to analyze in any meaningful way the legal
consequences raised by your question as the act was premised upon the
existence of an operational repository by the January 31, 1998 date.''

June 21, 1984 letter from Johnston to Secretary of Energy Donald Hodel:
   ``For some time I have been concerned about the Department's nuclear
waste program. In pursuing this concern I have put several questions to
Departmental spokesmen. Recently I received a rather extraordinary letter
from your General Counsel, Theodore J. Garrish, responding to a request
that I had made of the Department for a memorandum on the Department's
interpretation of certain provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982.
   ``I had asked for an opinion on the legal obligation of the Department
and the Department's authority to take title to spent nuclear fuel in the
event that a repository has not commenced operation. Garrish's reply was as
follows: ``...(W)e are not now in a position to analyze in any meaningful
way the legal consequences raised by your question....
   ``The only sensible interpretation I can put on this response is that
the Department does not want to provide an answer to my question.''

Draft letter, dated June 29, 1984, from Hodel to Johnston [Eric Fygi, DOE
deputy general counsel under the current administration, later said this is
an unused draft of the response Hodel later sent to Johnston on September
7, 1984.]:
   ``My first reaction to your letter was sympathy. Lord knows that many
times I, too, have despaired at getting a `sensible interpretation' out of
the Office of General Counsel. As if that were not enough, the Office of
General Counsel has adopted its own version of the winemaker's adage, under
which `they'll not opine before it's time.'
   ``But as I actually turned to Mr. Garrish's repsonse [sic] of May 30 it
seemed to make a good deal of sense. It emphasized Congress' clear policy
objective that acceptance of spent fuel for disposal would commence by
January 31, 1998. Instead of trying to render a legal opinion in a factual
vacuum, Mr. Garrish's letter advised you, correctly, that the Department is
`totally committed to achieving this objective.'''

August 30, 1984 letter from Garrish to Johnston:
   ``The Department does not intend to breach the legal commitments it has
made in carrying out the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and, of course, to date
there has been no suggestion that it has defaulted on any of its
obligations. To the contrary, this administration's clear policy commitment
is directed to commencing waste acceptance `beginning in 1998.'...
   ``Since the clear policy commitment made by the Congress in formulating
the Act was directed to beginning repository operations in sufficient time
to commence disposal of spent fuel by 1998, and since the Administration is
committed to achieving precisely that objective, the issues that might be
presented by the unavailability of a repository at that time have an
abstract quality. We are not in a position now to analyze in any meaningful
way the legal consequences of unavailability of a repository wholly bereft
of a real factual setting necessary to aid our understanding of the
question. Section 302(a) (5) contemplates beginning disposal of spent fuel
by January 31, 1998, and the Department is fully committed to achieving
that objective.''

September 7, 1984 letter from Hodel to Johnston:
   ``In our original letter, the Department stated a firm commitment to
accept for disposal, on an orderly schedule, high-level radioactive waste
and spent fuel not (sic) later than January 31, 1998.''

March 12, 1987 letter from DOE General Counsel J. Michael Farrell to Rep.
Philip Sharp (R-Ind.):
   ``(A)cceptance of spent fuel for storage at an MRS (monitored
retrievable storage) facility beginning January 31, 1998 would comply with
the contract requirements that were based on the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act...''
   ``Thus we believe section 302(a) (5) (A) imposes a duty on the Secretary
after commencement of repository operations to take title to spent fuel
promptly on request, but does not foreclose the Secretary from taking title
to spent fuel in advance of commencement of repository operations if that
step is necessary and appropriate in fulfilling the terms of the contract
by which the program is implemented.''

April 1, 1987 letter from Farrell to Sharp:
   ``Had Congress intended in section 302(a) (5) to specify a date by which
a first repository was to begin operations, the logical point at which to
express this policy would have been in that section's subsection that deals
expressly with `commencement of operation of a repository.' Instead, it
refrained from specifying a date certain for commencement of repository
operations, but required only that, once a repository has begun operations,
the Secretary shall act with expedition to take title to spent fuel on the
request of the generator or owner of spent fuel.''

Prehearing questions and answers related to the April 23, 1987 hearing by
the Senate Environment & Public Works Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation.
Witness: Secretary of Energy John Herrington.
   Q: ``Do you view the MRS facility as either a `disposal' facility or a
facility in which to `dispose' of `spent nuclear fuel?'''
   A: ``No. The MRS is viewed as a DOE facility as defined in Article I 10
of the contract; which would be an integral part of the waste disposal
system. That definition expressly includes a facility to which spent fuel
`may be shipped by DOE prior to its transportation to a disposal facility.'
The purpose of that definition was described in the preamble of the final
rule adopting the contract terms `to expressly state, an accordance with
the act, that there may be an interim storage facility...which DOE may
utilize prior to emplacement in a repository.''

January 12, 1991 letter from DOE waste program director Daniel Dreyfus to
Commissioner Susan Clark of the Florida Public Service Commission:
   ``The Department does not have a clear legal obligation under the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act to accept spent nuclear fuel absent an operational
repository or other facility. However, the Secretary has acknowledged her
belief that the Department may have created such an expectation through its
implementation of the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel
and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR 961). The Secretary has further
indicated her intention to explore with affected utilities various options
and methods for offsetting a portion of the financial burden associated
with continued onsite storage in order to address expectations resulting
from currently projected waste acceptance schedules.''

December 29, 1993 letter from Dreyfus to Robert Butterworth, Florida state
attorney general:
   ``The Department shares your concern regarding the timely provision of
disposal services for the Nation's spent nuclear fuel. When the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act was enacted in 1982, the Department planned to have a
facility in operation and prepared to begin acceptance of spent nuclear
fuel in 1998. The Department does not have a clear legal obligation under
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to accept spent nuclear fuel absent an
operations repository or other facility.''

SOUTH CAROLINA STUDIES WASTE FEE OPTIONS

   Concerned about the lack of progress in the DOE civilian high-level
nuclear waste program, South Carolina last month became the third state to
look into withholding nuclear utility ratepayer contributions from the
federal Nuclear Waste Fund. The state Public Service Commission on December
20 approved Commissioner Warren Arthur's motion to establish the review
process. Arthur said the commission is obligated to determine if the waste
fee is in fact a ``prudent expenditure.'' He said that commission staff
will look into such things as the legal aspects, under South Carolina laws,
of withholding the ratepayer payments.
   Arthur said that, in the context of a rate case proceeding, the
commission might later pursue such options as barring utilities from
passing the fee on to ratepayers, or placing that money into a special
escrow account. Arthur said the staff has been asked to present its
preliminary report to the commission February 22. The final report is due
by June 1.
   The Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) became the first state
body to request such a study in July 1995. SCC staff was slated to present
the report to the commission late last week. The Minnesota Department of
Public Service (DSC) announced its probe of the fee issue in November. Any
DSC recommendation to change the way the fee is handled would have to be
taken up by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.

WESTINGHOUSE HANFORD AWARD FEE $1.5-MILLION

   The Westinghouse Hanford Co. received a $1.5-million DOE award fee last
month after receiving a rating of ``good'' for its work at the shuttered
Hanford nuclear arms plant in Washington state. The rating covers the
six-month period ending September 30 and is up from the satisfactory grade
the company received for the previous six months. The maximum award fee
possible for work done during this latest rating period was $5-million.
   The fee is one of several the company can receive, based on the caliber
of its work. Westinghouse Hanford is prime contractor at the DOE site. DOE
said that fiscal 1995 fees awarded to the company as of December 15
included: $11.7-million out of a possible $13.3-million for meeting
performance-based objectives; $9.4-million, based on a claimed savings of
$188-million (DOE said a cost savings validations is under way and is
expected to add to the cost-savings fee.); and $2.6-million out of a
possible $3-million for its handling of solid waste at the site.

HOLTEC WINS RERACKING JOB AT ANGRA-1

   The team of Holtec International and U.S. Tool & Die has received a
contract to install high density spent fuel storage racks at Angra-1 in
Brazil. Value of the deal has been estimated at $6-million. The reracking
will increase the in-pool storage capacity of the Furnas Centrais
Electricas S.A. unit from 363 storage locations to 1,252 slots. Holtec said
the racks are designed to store fuel in two regions of the pool: Region 1
will be designed for storing fresh fuel assemblies, and Region 2 will be
for assemblies taking credit for burnup.

NRC STAFF LOOKS TO FRENCH PROGRAM AS IT REVIEWS DOE WORK ON BURNUP CREDIT

By:
Elaine Hiruo, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   NRC staff expects to soon be able to submit questions to DOE on the
department's topical report on burnup credit. When approved, the report
could serve as a valuable reference to dry storage vendors in the U.S.,
according to one DOE official.
   Late last month Charles Haughney, deputy director of the NRC spent fuel
program office, said he believed that DOE was on the road to addressing
issues surrounding the use of burnup credit. Key among them is
criticality.
   ``You really have to take an attitude that a criticality accident in the
public sector is absolutely unacceptable,'' Haughney said. Criticality
already is on NRC's roster of technical issues that must be addressed in
its licensing of such things as the spent fuel containers and the
repository itself.
   Any NRC approval of the DOE topical report is expected to have vendors
scrambling back to the drawing boards to redesign spent fuel baskets
already approved by the NRC. The credit could result in higher capacity
waste packages.
   Burnup credit is not now used in the U.S. Haughney was part of a
two-member NRC team that went to France in November to see how the issue is
handled there. The differences between the more mature French program and
DOE's would prevent any direct shifting of technology and ideas. But
Haughney said the visit left him wondering how some of what the French do
could be adapted to fit within the framework of the U.S. program.
   ``We went over there to get a little smarter, not to find the keys to
the kingdom,'' he said.
   French officials say that as fuel burnups increase, calculating the
residual uranium enrichment of spent fuel precisely can translate into
optimization of transport and consequent cost savings.
   Jean-Louis Ricaud, head of Cogema's reprocessing and engineering
operations, which also includes the Cogema group's transportation business,
said no special burnup credit was needed for fuels with an initial
uranium-235 enrichment of around 3%-3.5%, corresponding to today's standard
burnups of around 35,000 megawatt-days per metric ton. Standard spent fuel
transport casks and especially internal fuel baskets were designed to
prevent criticality accidents for such enrichment levels, he explained.
   But when utilities began moving to higher burnups, requiring initial
enrichments above 3.5%, the French company and its customers sought a
method to give credit for U-235 burnup in a reactor, in order to
demonstrate that spent higher-enrichment fuel does not in fact have a
residual enrichment greater than 3% and thus that no special measures are
required for its transport, such as loading the transport baskets with
fewer fuel elements.
   Ricaud said equipment has been developed to measure the dose rate from
assemblies in the reactor, calculate the fuel's content in fission
products, and deduce the amount of U burned and thus the amount remaining
in the assembly after discharge. The method requires monitoring fuel burnup
in-reactor. Ricaud said he didn't know how widespread the practice is in
France today; Electricite de France is only beginning to move to
higher-burnup fuel.
   Research staff of the Institute of Nuclear Safety and Protection (IPSN)
have participated in the development. IPSN is a semi-autonomous unit of the
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) which works partly for the CEA and
other industry customers, and partly in a safety analysis function for the
French nuclear safety authority, DSIN.
   Ricaud said that following a criticality specialists' meeting in
Albuquerque, N.M. last September, technicians from the CEA and the NRC had
agreed to pursue discussions on burnup credit.
   Ricaud observed that the U.S. situation is ``fundamentally different''
from the French situation, because spent fuel is generally shipped in
France to La Hague after only one or two years' cooling. In the U.S., he
said, fuel cools longer at-reactor, so the capacity of each transport cask
is theoretically higher. An additional margin could be won if credit is
given for burnup in calculating the amount of fuel that can be loaded into
a given basket. But the real problem in the U.S., he said, is that
``there's no place to ship'' the spent fuel.

TOLEDO EDISON BEGINS LOADING THREE NUHOMS MODULES AT DAVIS-BESSE

   Toledo Edison Co., after being cleared by NRC, began the process of
loading three Nuhoms spent fuel storage modules December 26 at Davis-Besse.
The modules, made by Vectra Technologies Inc., will hold 72 assemblies and
allow the utility to maintain a full-core off-load capability when it
enters a refueling outage in April. The utility may need two or more
additional modules in early 1998 (before the next refueling outage) if a
federal interim storage facility is not available, a company spokeswoman
said.
   NRC declined to grant a request from the Toledo Coalition for Safe
Energy to halt the loading of the casks. The Toledo group had one lawsuit
dismissed in November challenging the NRC rule allowing the Nuhoms cask to
be used for spent fuel storage. However,the group November 30 filed a new
lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
claiming that NRC improperly allowed Vectra to alter a safety analysis
report commitment on cask wall thickness (NF, 6 Nov. '95, 17). Joining the
Toledo Coalition in its latest suit is the Maryland Safe Energy Coalition,
which seeks to block the use of Nuhoms modules at Baltimore Gas & Electric
Co.'s Calvert Cliffs.
   Separately, Vectra reported in mid-November a net loss of $1.9-million
for the three months ending October 1 on revenue of $24-million. In the
same period a year ago, the company earned $23,000 on revenue of
$32.5-million.
   In a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Vectra said
the revenue decrease was due partially to a decrease in nuclear engineering
services. Vectra President Ray Fortney said the company would have a
stronger fourth quarter.
   In September, the company negotiated a new $3-million loan, which it
says will be sufficient to meet all its commitments through the end of
1995. But the 10Q filing notes that operations in 1995 will not alone
generate sufficient cash to continue operations. But it adds that
``management anticipates that sufficient cash will be provided through
additional reductions in operating expenses, entering into a joint venture
or strategic partnership, or the sale of other assets. The company also
intends to explore alternatives for raising capital through preferred stock
or a rights offering.'' Fortney said he is confident that ``Vectra will be
in business in 1996.''
   Earlier in the year, the company sold its chemical decontamination
business, Plant Services Inc., to Westinghouse for $19-million, less
certain adjustments. Among other things, Vectra used the money to reduce
long-term debt.

USEC SALE SHOULD BE CANCELED, SAYS HARVARD STUDY OF HEU DEAL

By:
Wilson Dizard III

   The planned privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corp. (USEC) is a bad
deal for the U.S. Treasury and for national security, according to a
forthcoming book by Richard Falkenrath and others of Harvard University's
Center for Science & International Affairs (CSIA).
   Falkenrath's study of the high-enriched uranium (HEU) deal and USEC's
role in it appears as part of Avoiding Nuclear Anarchy: Containing the
Threat of Loose Russian Nuclear Weapons and Fissile Material, to be
published by CSIA this year.
   According to a prepublication copy of the study provided to NuclearFuel,
``The U.S. government could resolve many of the problems with the U.S.
purchase of Russian HEU if it were simply to cancel the privatization of
USEC.
   ``Under this option, USEC would remain the executive agent of the HEU
deal, but the U.S. Treasury would remain USEC's sole owner. As a
government-owned corporation, USEC could be instructed to accept lower
profits for the foreign policy gains associated with the purchase of
Russian HEU--a trade the corporation would resist making if it were owned
by normal, profit maximizing investors.
   ``This solution, of course, would work only so long as the government
exercises more effective oversight of USEC's purchase of HEU from Russia
than was the case in 1994-95.
   ``Canceling the public sale of USEC is a less radical idea than it may
seem. Most if not all of the efficiency gains associated with
private-sector management were achieved in July 1993, when USEC was
established as a government-owned corporation out of the highly inefficient
government enrichment operation run by DOE. Few if any additional
efficiency gains can be expected by transferring the ownership from the
government to the private sector. Indeed, there are at least two reasons
why the public sale of USEC may be a poor choice for the government. The
first reason has already been noted: the White House could compel a
government-owned USEC to accept the lower profits associated with buying
Russian HEU, whereas a publicly owned USEC would resist this pressure.
   ``The second argument against privatizing USEC is that the net present
value of USEC as a government-owned corporation exceeds by a substantial
margin the net expected proceeds of the sale of USEC.''
   Falkenrath's analysis of the costs to USEC of buying Russian material is
based on his view that USEC's production cost for SWU hovers around $60,
compared to the current cost of SWU to USEC under the HEU deal of $82.50.
   The Harvard scholar's view that the sale of USEC will cost the U.S.
government more than it gains is based in part on a study of the
transaction conducted by the General Accounting Office last year (NF, 25
Sept. '95, 1).
   Other enrichment market analysts have raised the point that delaying,
rather than canceling, the sale of USEC could lead to increased revenue for
the U.S. government. Under one privately discussed analysis, the Treasury
would stand to gain as much as $1-billion by delaying the sale of USEC for
one year.

NRC Sees Certification Delay
   Another factor that could impair the privatization of USEC is the recent
announcement by NRC staff that completion of the review of the federal SWU
company's application for safety certification will be delayed by several
weeks.
   NRC's Executive Director for Operations, James Taylor, informed the NRC
commissioners November 28 that the certification schedule was likely to
slip several weeks from the previous completion date of February 29.
   NRC staff asked USEC 1,300 first-round questions about the second safety
certification application the federal SWU corporation submitted on
September 15. The first safety certification application was rejected in
April
   ``USEC has responded to a substantial number of questions,'' Taylor
wrote. ``However, responses to a number of substantive issues have not yet
been received. In addition, it is apparent from discussions with USEC that
certain issues raised by the staff's questions will not be easily resolved.
For example, the staff believes that substantial improvements are needed in
USEC's proposed technical safety requirements, particularly those needed to
ensure protection of workers from death or serious injuries from potential
uranium hexafluoride accidents.''
   Taylor said NRC staff would brief the commission before making a
decision on certification. He made his comments in Secy 95-279, ``Status of
Certification of the USEC Gaseous Diffusion Plants.''
   Separately, USEC announced that it has hired Donald Hatcher as director
of risk management. Hatcher will oversee insurance programs at USEC.

MINATOM EXPECTS EURATOM HEU DEAL; STATE DEPT. WON'T INTERVENE ON FRM-2

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow; Michael Knapik, Washington

   The Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) for the Russian Federation and
the European Union (EU) have begun negotiations over supply of weapon-grade
high-enriched uranium (HEU) to the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) and may soon
conclude an agreement, Moscow officials confirmed last month.
   According to an aide to Minatom head Viktor Mikhailov, negotiations on
supply of HEU for research reactor fuel to ESA might be concluded by late
January. The aide added, however, that scheduling and other details could
push back a final agreement until sometime in February.
   Diplomatic sources in Moscow said that so far Minatom had not attached
any ``unusual restrictions'' on the supply of the HEU to Euratom beyond
requiring the usual peaceful-use commitments. Accordingly, HEU supplied by
Minatom to ESA would be fungible under the terms of a peaceful-use
agreement, and it will be up to ESA to determine how the material would be
distributed.
   The sources said that, also conforming with usual practice for
peaceful-use agreements, Minatom would specify that HEU it supplied is
intended for use in research reactor fuel and would expect to receive a
list of where Euratom intends to store, process, and irradiate the
material.
   German opponents to the FRM-2 materials test reactor project, planned to
be built by the Technical University of Munich, have said the Russian HEU
would effectively relieve pressure from the U.S. to convert the reactor to
use low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.
   Following up high-level talks in September between Secretary of Energy
Hazel O'Leary and German IAEA representative Cornelia Yzer, U.S. and German
officials are expected to meet in Garching in mid-January to discuss the
prospects for building the FRM-2 with a slightly larger power rating and a
core using lower-enriched uranium. DOE hopes to see Germany agree to
re-design FRM-2 to use fuel proposed by the Reduced Enrichment for Research
and Test Reactor (RERTR) program. Argonne National Laboratory unilaterally
produced such a redesign last year at a meeting of the RERTR program
participants, raising protests from the FRM-2 sponsors and constructor
Siemens (NF, 25 Sept. '95, 7).

No State Department Action
   After the U.S. Department of State asked Germany to confirm a report
that Minatom and ESA had agreed to supply HEU for research reactors (NF, 25
Sept. '95, 7), diplomatic sources speculated that the State Department
would intervene--either to persuade Russia not to consummate a deal that
would challenge U.S. nonproliferation policy, or to request assurances from
ESA that FRM-2 would not be supplied Russian-origin HEU.
   But a senior U.S. official said last week that the State Department
would not take any action with Moscow. The official suggested that as long
as the U.S. is using HEU in some research reactors, U.S. objections to
FRM-2 running on the material are not credible. In the past this argument
has been pushed by European operators, who have said they are disadvantaged
commercially by the continued use of HEU in the U.S.
   Other U.S. officials say that the German desk at the State Department
has determined that proliferation concern about using HEU in FRM-2 is a
low-priority issue in U.S.-German affairs.

GAN IN NO POSITION TO TAKE RUSSIAN PHYSICAL INVENTORY

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   Gosatomnadzor (GAN), the agency appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to
watch over Russia's nuclear materials, has neither the means nor the
political clout to carry out a comprehensive material balance inventory,
Russian officials said last month.
   Yuri Volodin, head of the department of safeguards at GAN, said that
inspectors have been able to do only ``book audits'' based on data already
collected by operators of facilities under the control of the Ministry of
Atomic Energy (Minatom). In addition to the audits, GAN personnel can
conduct ``problem checks'' of data, to see how a facility operator obtains
and processes the information.
   ``In a few cases,'' Volodin said, facility operators ``measured
canisters for us,'' to verify the amounts of material declared to GAN. ``We
have been everywhere and seen everything, but not much of the inventory has
been verified,'' he said.
   There is no central data bank at Minatom or GAN for inventories of
nuclear material. GAN officials said that inventory data are in the hands
of plant operators. The only reporting obligation plant management has to
central authorities in Moscow, one official said, is an ``annual request''
by the Ministry of Finance to report on the production of materials for
customs purposes. GAN does not know whether Minatom facilities routinely
comply with those reporting requests, he said.
   GAN staffers complain that the agency has never seen some sensitive
inventory data that Minatom passed on to the U.S. DOE in mid-1995. That
information was given to the U.S. as part of a bilateral agreement related
to the transfer of weapon-grade uranium to the U.S. and the disposition of
Russian plutonium.
   There are also no plans at GAN to conduct a comprehensive physical
inventory in Russia. Volodin said that such an effort would require
technical means, political authority, and funding that is out of his
agency's reach. The cost of new equipment needed to take a complete
physical inventory would be about $6-million. GAN has nearly no resources
at all and is routinely two to three weeks behind in paying staffers, he
said.
   To meet payroll and routine expenses for the last several months of
1995, the central government had to scrape to find an extra 300-million
rubles (about $60,000 at current exchange rates). For safeguards efforts at
DOE or Euratom, Volodin said, ``this amount would be a pittance.''
   But it paid about 30 safeguards inspectors located in four Russian
regions that GAN has staffed up during the 24 months since Yeltsin made GAN
responsible for nuclear materials accounting. Permanent on-site inspectors
have been assigned to bulk-handling facilities at Tomsk-7, Krasnoyarsk-26,
Chelyabinsk-65, and Sverdlovsk-44.
   Regional centers have been set up in St. Petersburg for northeastern
Russia (Northern Fleet naval fuel inventories in Severodvinsk, all
RMBK-design reactors, and St. Petersburg research institutions); in
Novosibirsk for Siberia (11 fuel cycle processing facilities, including
Tomsk-7, Krasnoyarsk-26, and Angarsk; plus a uranium mining operation in
Chita); and Ekaterinburg for the Urals (fuel processing plants in
Sverdlovsk-44 and Chelyabinsk-65).

Naval Fuel Accounting Deficiencies
   A fourth regional center for the Far East is also being set up in
Khabarovsk, centering on the Komsomolsk shipyard at the mouth of the Amur
River. Officials said that GAN had gotten enough access to fuel assembly
operations for the Pacific Fleet to have determined that there is ``no
input control, no quality control for nuclear material, no check of the
quantity of material in single cores, and no accounting system'' during
preparation of naval propulsion fuel, another Russian official said.
   Through the St. Petersburg center, GAN is working with the Murmansk
Shipping Co. and the German firm Gesellschaft fuer Anlagen- und
Reaktorsicherheit mbH (GRS) to improve physical protection and accounting
measures for nuclear fuels associated with Russian icebreakers and other
non-military vessels.
   While Yeltsin at the outset had put GAN in charge of accounting for all
Russian nuclear materials, in October 1994 Yeltsin stripped GAN of
responsibility for military inventories and production facilities.
   Volodin downplayed the impact of the Yeltsin decision, calling it a
``relief'' that served to clarify questions about GAN's access and
eliminate a conflict point between GAN, Minatom, and the Ministry of
Defense (MOD). But other officials complained that Minatom had pressed
Yeltsin to keep GAN out of military activities. Minatom ``plays all kinds
of political games in Moscow'' to deny GAN funds and authority, another GAN
inspector complained. ``The basic problem we have is that Minatom just
doesn't believe in the need for an independent safeguards agency.''
   Just before Yeltsin cut off GAN's access to military activities, this
official elaborated, MOD had begun to work with GAN and had appointed a
representative on a joint committee to organize safeguards activities at
defense-related facilities. Now, MOD itself is in sole charge of safeguards
at these sites. GAN officials said that MOD, unlike GAN, does not have a
set of procedures for accounting for weapon-grade uranium and plutonium,
however. In the meantime, MOD has assured GAN that it will get complete
access to disarmament materials, once they are broken down from weapons
components.
   Minatom officials objected that, in the U.S., NRC also has no safeguards
access to defense-related materials. But GAN staffers replied that DOE,
unlike Minatom, has a complex defense material accounting and control
system that relies heavily on established safeguards practices.

Plutonium MUF Problems
   One result of Yeltsin's October 1994 ``clarification'' is that GAN has
been told it has access in principle to all inventories of UO2 and PuO2,
including those produced by defense-related facilities, officials said.
   According to Volodin, GAN's access is blocked once oxides are processed
into metal form. A discussion is underway between Minatom and GAN about the
point where GAN must forfeit access and the material becomes categorized as
defense material, Volodin said. ``But we have access to all the PuO2 stored
at all the reprocessing plants,'' he said.
   Regardless of access in principle to PuO2 inventories, lack of proper
equipment has prevented GAN and Minatom so far from accurately measuring
and verifying plutonium inventories at bulk-handling facilities. This has
contributed to a significant estimate of material unaccounted for (MUF) in
process inventories at the RT-1 reprocessing plant at Chelyabinsk-65
(Ozersk), for example, officials said.
   Surge tanks at RT-1 have a ring geometry that, one GAN official said,
prevents plutonium in solution from settling homogeneously, causing
significant reliability problems. In addition, the accuracy of equipment
used at RT-1 to weigh samples of material is only plus or minus 5 grams per
each 3-kilogram sample.
   The point of departure for Minatom's calculation of initial inventory at
any bulk-handling facility is the estimated amount of U-235 in fresh fuel
feedstocks. GAN has access to historical records of these estimates, but,
officials said, Minatom never used non-destructive or destructive analysis
to verify the estimates. The only reliable plutonium inventory figures
available for reprocessing plants are for the plutonium output itself,
which can be determined analytically.
   Independently of the battles over authority, GAN officials said that, at
the facility level, plant management is very cooperative with their efforts
to assess inventories. According to fuel cycle plant officials, however,
cooperation would be less if facilities were operating at Western capacity
factors. RT-1 last year ran at about 30% of design throughput. ``We have
plenty of time to show the inspectors around,'' said chief engineer Evgeny
Dzekun.

WITHOUT EC ASSURANCES, NRC MOVES TO SUSPEND COMPONENT EXPORTS

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris; Mark Hibbs, Bonn

   A jurisdictional dispute between the European Commission and certain
member states prevented Euratom from giving the U.S. legal assurances
required for certain nuclear reactor and fuel component exports before the
expiration of the U.S.-Euratom agreement for cooperation on December 31.
   As a result, the U.S. NRC was in the process, as NuclearFuel went to
press December 28, of suspending the general and specific licenses (those
licenses referred to as XCOM and XMAT) to export reactor components, heavy
water, and nuclear-grade graphite to all Euratom countries except Spain,
Sweden, and Finland. NRC's action could cost several companies
``potentially millions of dollars,'' said one agency staffer.
   A senior EC official said December 28 that member states are examining
two solutions but that neither would be in place when the original
U.S.-Euratom agreement expires, and with it the validity of the existing
letters of assurance.
   The list of so-called non-major or non-sensitive components is contained
in items five through nine of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 110. The items
include pressure tubes, zirconium tubes, such reactor internals as core
support structures, and reactor control drive mechanisms. Among the
companies most affected by the suspension are Siemens--which imports
zirconium tubes from the U.S. and has a large fuel fabrication business in
the U.S.--and Carpenter Technology, sources said.
   European Commission staff had hoped that an interim solution could be
worked out to avoid an interruption of trade in the affected items on
December 31. They had aimed at an ``interim measure'' under which the
Commission would have made the necessary assurances on behalf of European
Union (EU) member countries, while preparing a permanent exchange of
letters--to be submitted for formal approval by the European Council--that
would take effect with the new U.S.-Euratom agreement in the spring (NF, 18
Dec. '95, 8).
   Sources said, however, that France and Britain objected to the
Commission making the assurances on their behalf, because they touch areas
in which the Commission does not have jurisdiction, or shares it with
member states. This is notably the case for the assurance that the exported
items will be used for peaceful purposes only, since defense is a national
prerogative in the EU today.
   Pressed by Siemens, the German government approached the U.S. about
delivering a separate set of assurances so that exports could continue to
Germany. That solution became less attractive, however, when the Germans
were told that with such bilateral assurances, German companies could not
transfer the exported components to another country within Euratom without
U.S. consent.
   In addition to control over retransfers, the U.S. requires countries to
give assurances that the components will be under IAEA safeguards and will
be used for peaceful purposes. In the U.S., the fact that the new
assurances have not been given was described as ``disturbing and
mystifying,'' by a senior administration official.
   The assurances are necessary to satisfy U.S. law--which many Europeans
apparently find just as mystifying. The non-major components and materials
are not covered by the U.S.-Euratom agreement, which contains similar
assurances covering more sensitive nuclear materials, equipment and
technology. But the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act required
peaceful-use, safeguards and retransfer-approval assurances on the
non-sensitive items, too--hence the need for separate assurances covering
them.
   The current generic component assurances, given in 1979, are tied to the
expiring U.S.-Euratom agreement, although they are not a part of it.
   The U.S. entered into separate agreements with Sweden, Spain, and
Finland before they became members of Euratom. As a result, nuclear exports
can continue to those countries under the individual agreements, even in
the absence of any agreement between the U.S. and Euratom.

Authority Of EC Assurances Challenged
   One source following the U.S.-Euratom saga in Brussels said that the
Commission had produced a draft assurance package and submitted it to EU
country ambassadors at their regular meeting December 22. But certain EU
states maintain that the Commission does not have the authority to make the
required commitments. ``They can't make a peaceful-use commitment for us,''
said a French official. ``That's the prerogative of member states.''
   Worse, said one industry official, EU states didn't know there had been
an exchange of letters between the Commission and the U.S. government in
1979, containing such commitments on behalf of the states, until last July,
when the Commission was forced to make the old letters public in the course
of EU debate on the new Euratom-U.S. agreement for cooperation.
   The discovery that the Commission had unilaterally agreed to the U.S.
conditions in 1979 added to the tension surrounding the intra-Community
negotiation of the U.S.-Euratom text, member state sources said.
   ``We were astonished when we discovered the existence of that exchange
of letters,'' said an attorney for a major French nuclear company.
   The senior Commission official acknowledged that in fact the European
Council--the EU's collective political leadership--had been informed
officially of the existing exchange only at the beginning of November. And
a check following the protests of member states last summer turned up ``no
trace of a report to the Council'' in 1979, when the initial exchange was
accomplished, or since then, he said.
   The EC official said the history of the commitments was still unclear,
but ``it's possible it was considered as a measure for management of the
(U.S.-Euratom) agreement'' at the time. Such management measures can be
taken without the Council's approval.
   ``Obviously, that didn't improve the atmosphere'' between the Commission
and member states, which have criticized the Commission's negotiation of
the U.S.-Euratom agreement, the Commission official acknowledged. It also
didn't help, he said, that the matter was put before the EU ambassadors
``under pressure'' right before the Christmas break. ``People got a bit
irritated,'' the official said, and an agreement could not be found.
   French vendors aren't very affected by the Section 109b assurances,
industry sources said, because they export very few such components from
the U.S. But they are worried about the principles involved in the
assurances.
   One attorney for a French vendor, who appeared to believe there was
still some leeway in U.S. law to permit an alternative to the blanket
assurance letters, said he wondered if it would be simpler to provide
assurances case-by-case on affected components or materials destined for
export from the U.S. The industry does not like the fact that the letters
of assurance also list countries to which U.S.-origin components may be
freely re-exported, he said.

German Industry Sought Action
   According to a German fuel cycle official, German industry pressed the
German Foreign Ministry to submit independent assurances to the U.S.
``after it became clear that (the EU) would not act in time'' to prevent an
interruption in bilateral commerce.
   The German official said that difficulties had arisen during negotiation
of a ``consensus text'' of the letters among Euratom parties, noting the
objections by France and Britain related to their status as nuclear weapon
states. The official also said that German representatives had had
difficulty demonstrating to Euratom ``just how serious our situation is.''
   As of mid-December, he said, Bonn had been assured that the U.S.
Department of State would take action on the letter submitted by Germany.
   The official said that in anticipation of a December 31 cutoff, Siemens
had succeeded in stockpiling U.S.-origin zirconium in Germany for later use
in manufacturing fuel assemblies. But the company did not manage to arrange
for advance production and delivery of all UO2 fuel assemblies under
contract with European customers through the first few months of 1996, nor
in stockpiling enough UO2 to manufacture assemblies using its limited
capacity available in Germany.
   The EC official said the Commission and member states are considering
two alternatives: either a complete set of bilateral assurances, such as
those proposed by Germany, but only provided any potential obstacle to
intra-Community trade is removed; or ``collective assurances'' that would
be given by the Commission and member states together, ``each one according
to his jurisdiction.''
   Whatever is decided, an interruption in trade in the nonsensitive
materials and components is inevitable and will likely last for several
weeks, until the EU can formally approve a new set of assurance letters.

DOE POSTPONES DECISION ON ALTERNATIVE FOR TAKING BACK RESEARCH REACTOR
FUEL

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington

   Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary apparently decided December 22 not to
decide on a preferred alternative for dealing with about 22,000 spent fuel
elements of U.S.-origin fuel that have been used at non-U.S. research
reactors around the world. Sources said O'Leary wants some more analysis
from her staff.
   The fact that selection of a preferred alternative for DOE's final
environmental impact statement (EIS) was again delayed would typically be
criticized by advocates of those foreign research reactors facing a spent
fuel storage crisis. Instead, the non-decision was greeted with a sigh of
relief by those sources because, in their opinion, DOE was about to decide
on an alternative that would be ineffective, be open to legal challenge by
Greenpeace, and be fatal to the U.S.'s reduced enrichment in research and
test reactor (RERTR) program.
   Those points were made in a December 20 letter to O'Leary by Howard
Shapar, who along with Joseph Egan has provided legal assistance to a group
of 17 foreign research reactor operators--a group put together by Edlow
International--that have spent fuel covered by the EIS. Shapar told O'Leary
that he learned her staff was leaning toward an option that would have
forced operators in countries with a nuclear waste program to send their
fuel to the U.K's Dounreay plant for reprocessing. DOE would sign a
memorandum of understanding with the U.K. under which Dounreay would, in
the future, begin reprocessing low-enriched spent fuel. Reactors operating
temporarily on high-enriched fuel would have to down-blend to LEU with DOE
paying the cost of down-blending. DOE would reprocess the remainder of the
fuel at its Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina except for Triga
fuel, which would be shipped to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
   This option, Shapar said, ``would send a strong signal to the foreign
research reactor community that DOE has abandoned the RERTR program for all
but a few select reactors.'' He mentioned that government authorities in
Sweden and Denmark, and probably in Norway, will not allow reactor
operators in those countries to pursue the Dounreay option, ``largely for
political reasons.'' DOE, Shapar said, will have stranded these countries
with no alternative other than shutdown and/or HEU dry storage.
   Other operators, Shapar said, will stop efforts to convert their
reactors. ``They will not now expend millions of dollars on conversion,''
Shapar said, ``in the hope that DOE's MOU with Britain will produce an LEU
reprocessing stream at Dounreay by the time they are ready to ship their
LEU spent fuel. Instead, they will maintain operations on HEU fuel and
avail themselves of a certain HEU reprocessing stream, with reliance on
Russian HEU.''
   Shapar went on to note that Greenpeace, which is opposed to reprocessing
at Dounreay, would likely sue DOE ``for failing to consider the
extraterritorial impacts of its actions in the U.K.''
   Shapar said DOE should decide to bring all of the spent fuel (except the
Triga fuel) to Savannah River. ``Given DOE's recent decisions to keep one
of the reprocessing canyons open at the SRS...it is unlikely that the
state's congressional delegation will oppose taking the foreign research
fuel back,'' Shapar said. The governor of South Carolina could sue, ``but
we believe that to be very winnable litigation,'' Shapar said.

RT-1 OPERATION FACES COST CRISIS, UNCERTAIN FUTURE DEMAND SCHEDULE

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   A senior official at the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy
(Minatom) said last month that prices for reprocessing services at the RT-1
separation plant at Ozersk must be raised to justify further operation.
   Evgeny Dzekun, chief engineer at RT-1, told NuclearFuel that the
reprocessing plant, designed to handle a throughput of 400 metric tons
heavy metal (MTHM) of spent fuel from VVER-440 reactors, naval reactors,
and fast reactors, is currently allowed by local authorities to reprocess
up to 250 MTHM/yr spent fuel.
   During 1995, however, RT-1 handled far less than that amount, and in
1996 it will process still less spent fuel, officials in Moscow said last
month. Ozersk was earlier known as Chelyabinsk-65.
   Dzekun said that between 150 and 180 MT of spent fuel were reprocessed
at RT-1 in 1995. According to information from other Minatom fuel cycle
officials, the total was closer to 150 MT. At average discharge burnups for
VVER-440 fuel of 20,000-25,000 megawatt-days/MT, about 0.8% of the
recovered output is plutonium. Since Dzekun said that the amount of fresh
plutonium added to the stockpile at Ozersk during 1995 was just over 1 MT,
no more than about 150 MT of spent fuel could have been handled there,
these experts said.
   Dzekun had said previously that, up to 1990, the historical average
throughput at RT-1 was about 200 MT/yr; in 1991, he said, 170 MT was
reprocessed, and in 1992, 120 MT (NF, 4 Jan. '93, 4).
   Russia's overall economic situation, and the failure of nuclear power
plants to be paid for power they produce (Nucleonics Week, 7 Dec. '95, 1),
meant that plant management ``can no longer pay for reprocessing,'' Dzekun
said.

U.S. `Interference'
   Dzekun also claimed that U.S. government interference posed a threat to
his reprocessing operation, and he blamed Washington for persuading VVER
reactor management outside Russia to opt for dry storage of spent fuel.
   Officials in Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic all have
felt diplomatic pressure from the U.S. not to reprocess any more VVER fuel,
he said.
   Last month, under terms of a commercial contract with Finland's IVO, the
latest annual shipment of spent fuel from the Loviisa VVERs to Ozersk
occurred. The Finns are still considering whether to ship spent fuel to
RT-1 in 1996 (NF, 18 Dec. '95, 15). Dzekun said that, contrary to claims by
environmental groups, safety will not be a factor in Finland's decision.
Both IVO and regulator STUK have surveyed the RT-1 reprocessing operation
and found it ``safe and reliable.'' However, IVO can send the fuel to the
storage facility being built by Finland's other nuclear utility, TVO.
   In both 1994 and 1995, RT-1 took delivery of spent fuel from the Paks
VVER station in Hungary under a spent fuel takeback deal signed in 1994.
Dzekun said that Paks management has decided in principle to continue
reprocessing spent fuel at RT-1 in 1996 but that it is ``intimidated'' by
the consequences of Russian nuclear law, passed in mid-1995. The law
obliges RT-1's foreign clients to take back high-level reprocessing waste
(HLW) in vitrified form after 25 years of interim storage.
   Hungary ``must take this into consideration if it wants to keep
reprocessing,'' he said. GEC-Alsthom is building a vault-type spent fuel
storage facility for the Paks Nuclear Power Plant that Dzekun suggested
could be licensed to contain HLW.

Reprocessing Cost Inflation
   Dzekun said that, every three months, the cost of inputs for RT-1
reprocessing operations are adjusted upward because of continuing Russian
inflation and market price reforms.
   Real prices for electricity, chemicals, equipment, and transportation
have reached near-Western levels, he said, while RT-1 is tied to premarket
contracts and is not able to pass these increased costs on to customers.
``We will have to raise the price of reprocessing to Russian reactors to
continue justifying operation of the plant,'' Dzekun said. Dzekun said that
he was holding talks with Russian VVER plant managers in an effort to
``persuade'' them to pay more for reprocessing services.
   Dzekun would not reveal the price that VVER-440 stations in Russia pay
for reprocessing. According to unconfirmed reports from other Minatom
sources, however, in some cases reactor management pays as little as $50
per kilogram heavy metal (kgHM), compared to European reprocessors' going
rate of about $1,000/kgMH.
   Similar to steps taken by Cogema to hang on to its German reprocessing
clients (NF, 4 July '94, 1), Minatom will offer VVER-440 reactors a
``package deal'' involving an array of fuel cycle services, including fuel
fabrication, along with higher reprocessing prices, Moscow officials said.
   One senior Russian fuel cycle official qualified that because Minatom
has dropped the VVER-440 from its nuclear energy development plan, ``the
real issue for RT-1 is who its clients will be'' in the future.
   In the meantime, the RT-1 client base is expected to shrink further.
Minatom plans to decommission soon after 2000 the country's older VVER-440
reactors, including Kola-1 and -2, and Novovoronezh-3 and -4. These units
reprocess their spent fuel at Ozersk. Dzekun ``must convince foreign
clients to keep reprocessing'' to keep RT-1 operating, according to an aide
to Minatom head Viktor Mikhailov.
   The aide speculated that an alternative strategy would be to put RT-1 to
work on the huge inventory of spent fuel from the Russian Navy icebreaker
and submarine fleet. But he said that neither Minatom nor the Ministry of
Defense can fund major management of Russia's daunting propulsion reactor
fuel inventory.
   Evgeny Mikerin, head of Minatom's fuel cycle operations, said that
reprocessing of UO2-based icebreaker fuel at RT-1 poses no technical
challenges, but that a large inventory of spent icebreaker fuel presently
stored near Murmansk would be ``difficult to transport'' to Ozersk.
Uranium-zirconium fuels used in submarine reactors, Mikerin said, are
difficult to reprocess there.
   Dzekun also would not disclose prices paid by RT-1's foreign clients.
But Mikerin said that speculation that Hungary pays only about $200/kgHM
for reprocessing services is false. Mikerin said that both the Paks VVER
station and IVO are paying ``somewhat less'' than the Western price, adding
that the rates charged foreign clients are consistent with Minatom's policy
of slightly undercutting market prices.
   According to unconfirmed reports from other Moscow sources, IVO pays
about $700/kgHM for RT-1 reprocessing.
   At present, about 28 MT of separated plutonium from RT-1 VVER
reprocessing operations are stored at Ozersk, Dzekun reported. A little
more than 1 MT was added in 1995. Minatom will continue to stockpile the
plutonium there, he said, in anticipation of BN-800 fast reactors being
built at the Beloyarsk and South Urals sites--the latter adjacent to
RT-1--to absorb the material later as MOX fuel.
   According to Mikerin, however, no funding is allocated for BN-800
construction, and the units will not be built until sometime in the next
century.
   Three years ago, Dzekun said, reprocessing-related operations at
Chelyabinsk-65 employed about 18,000 people. Now the complex provides work
for 14,000; the other 4,000 employees have left for commercial work
elsewhere in the formerly closed city.

REPROCESSING CRITICS SAY MAYAK WILL DIE WITHOUT FOREIGN BUSINESS

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Official Russian recognition that the RT-1 reprocessing plant at Ozersk
is fighting for its future confirms predictions made by reprocessing
critics last year.
   In companion papers submitted to the recent Global 95 conference in
Versailles, Anatoly Diakov of the Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology,
and Oleg Bukharin of Princeton University, argued that without reprocessing
business from Hungary and Finland, paid for in hard currency, RT-1 ``would
be completely unprofitable,'' as Diakov put it.
   Ironically, Bukharin pointed out that the existing backlog of naval
spent fuel and submarine dismantlement--amounting to up to 350 submarine
reactor cores' worth of spent fuel within a few years--would provide enough
work for RT-1's naval fuel processing line for ``tens of years,'' even at
100% capacity. But ``this work does not add to the plant's revenues,''
Bukharin said, since the fees paid to RT-1 operator Mayak by the Navy and
the icebreaker fleet only cover production costs. He added that the Navy is
having trouble finding even that amount, independent of the problem of
shipping the spent cores.
   Reprocessing of HEU fuel, Bukharin said, is not favored by Mayak because
it must be funded by Minatom (the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy) and
is actually a drag on Mayak's own budget.
   Bukharin reviewed the situation with operators of VVER-440 reactors in
Russia and abroad, concluding that economic difficulties in Ukraine and
Bulgaria would diminish the economic value of any spent fuel takeback
arrangements with reactors there. As for VVER-440 operators in central
Europe and Finland, they are gradually moving toward alternative
arrangements, in light of Minatom's high reprocessing fees and the new
requirement for returning waste to reprocessing customers.
   ``Reprocessing of foreign spent fuel has become the principal source of
revenues for Mayak,'' Bukharin said, but those revenues ``cannot be assured
in the future....The loss of the foreign contracts would likely undermine
Mayak's reprocessing business.''
   Recently, Minatom officials--like some of their counterparts in the
West--have attempted to sell future reprocessing operations at RT-1 as part
of a global disarmament and waste management strategy involving mixed-oxide
fuel use and, potentially, advanced techniques of actinide incineration.
   Even if Mayak stopped processing spent fuel soon, Russia would still
have a weapons plutonium inventory of 125 metric tons--an amount destined
to grow in the future as plutonium is separated out from nuclear weapons
components--and a civilian stockpile totaling 72 MT, excluding plutonium
contained in about 8,000 MT of spent fuel stored at reactor sites,
according to Diakov's figures. As of October 1994, all newly produced
plutonium is supposed to be stored in oxide form. High-level Minatom
officials have argued that this plutonium represents a ``national
treasure'' whose use as fuel must be promoted.
   But Diakov argued that technical difficulties, including reactor design,
costs and licensing requirements, would foreclose the introduction of MOX
fuels in Russia's VVER-1000 reactor fleet. Minatom has essentially no
experience burning MOX in LWRs, an argument used by breeder reactor
enthusiasts to promote the recycling of plutonium in fast reactors instead
of LWRs (NF, 9 Oct. '95, 6).
   Diakov, however, contends that the high cost of MOX in a breeder
strategy also would kill that option. He cited an estimated cost of
$765-million for a new BN-800 fast reactor at Beloyarsk and a
multimillion-dollar cost for the so-called Shop 300 plutonium fuel
fabrication plant at Ozersk. An additional three BN-800 units planned for
the South Urals site, near the Mayak complex, would cost $3-billion, he
said.
   Diakov--a well-known opponent of reprocessing and bete noire of
Minatom--said that the nuclear ministry had requested $85-million as part
of its fiscal 1995 program to support a program for transforming ex-weapons
plutonium into MOX fuel. But as of last June 30, the ministry had received
less than 10% of the funds, he said.
   Another potential obstacle is Russia's new nuclear legislation, which
imposes more stringent environmental standards and consequently complicates
licensing of new fuels.
   Because of ``Russia's current chaotic political and economical
condition,'' the Moscow researcher wrote, ``it is unlikely that plans for
Pu utilization will be carried out soon.''
   Moreover, Diakov said, Minatom is not enthusiastic about non-reactor
options for plutonium disposition, such as vitrifying the material, which
it perceives as unsafe.
   Diakov predicted that ``in the next several decades...there will be no
plutonium use in Russia.'' For one thing, Russia's uranium production
capability can support 100 gigawatts of installed reactor capacity, while
the country has only 22 GW. For another, its stockpiles of high-enriched
uranium and uranium enrichment tails are estimated at 1,200 metric tons and
300,000 MT, respectively. Finally, Diakov said, Minatom has about
15-million SWU worth of enrichment capacity and the potential to fabricate
4%-enriched uranium fuel from 0.3% tails at a cost of $540 per kilogram.
   ``It is clear there is no economical motivation for Russia's nuclear
industry to reprocess spent fuel or use plutonium for fuel fabrication,''
he said. Diakov argued that the real question is whether Russia's nuclear
business will take a short- or long-term view of the plutonium disposition
issue. He noted that the main concern is ``to prevent diversion and reuse
of weapons-grade material in new weapons.''
   Rather than seek new uses for plutonium, Diakov contended, the Russian
government should ally with the U.S. to ``make a determined effort to set
up a reciprocal regime of plutonium storage under bilateral or
international control.''

NONPROLIFERATION, SPENT FUEL HANDLING KEY TO LWR SUPPLY CONTRACT WITH DPRK

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   Under a supply contract signed between the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO) and North Korea in New York December 15,
KEDO will be responsible for providing fuel to and handling spent fuel from
the two light water reactors promised to Pyongyang.
   North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Ho Jon, and KEDO
Executive Director Stephen Bosworth signed the agreement following long and
difficult negotiations that began in Kuala Lumpur in September and resumed
October 16 in New York City. While the contract leaves many details about
the reactor deal unanswered, it paves the way for a possible
ground-breaking at the reactor site in North Korea as early as April, a
source close to the talks said.
   KEDO will finance the $4.5-billion reactor project. It still must enter
into a prime contract; select a ``program coordinator,'' as the
architect/engineer is being called; and finish the site characterization
underway at Sinpo. The Korean Electric Power Corp. is expected to be the
prime contractor, with a number of subcontractors. The supply contract says
that the program coordinator is to be a U.S. firm. The contract for program
coordinator is expected to be awarded based on open competition, with a
request for proposals going out in January or February, said one source
close to the talks. The contract calls for completion of the two reactors
by 2003.
   The contract specifies that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) will continue the freeze on its 5-MW research reactor and refrain
from building the two larger reactors that were planned, as well as
continue to cooperate in safely storing and canning the spent fuel from the
research reactor, Dan Poneman said at a news briefing in Washington, D.C.
on December 15. Poneman is senior director for nonproliferation and export
controls at the National Security Council.
   KEDO was established in March by the U.S., the Republic of Korea, and
Japan to finance the cost of constructing two 1,000-MW reactors promised to
North Korea under the October 1994 Agreed Framework between the U.S. and
North Korea. The Clinton administration negotiated the agreement to address
the nuclear weapons proliferation threat posed by the DPRK.
   The supply contract says that KEDO will provide nuclear fuel for the
initial loading of each LWR and then will assist the DPRK in obtaining LWR
fuel, other than that provided in the initial loading, through commercial
contracts. KEDO and the DPRK are to cooperate to ensure safe storage of
spent fuel. ``If requested by KEDO, the DPRK must relinquish any ownership
rights over the LWR spent fuel and agree to the transfer of the spent fuel
out of the DPRK through commercial contracts,'' a KEDO statement said.

Contract Prohibits Reprocessing
   Under the contract, the DPRK agrees to apply IAEA safeguards to the LWR
project. North Korea also agrees not to reprocess or increase the
enrichment level of any nuclear material used in or produced through the
use of any reactor or nuclear material transferred in connection with the
reactor project.
   KEDO officials insist that no target date has been set for the
ground-breaking, because there are still many uncertainties surrounding the
project. That decision will depend on the findings of the site
characterization teams and on the timetable for completion of the other
contracts and protocols that KEDO needs to negotiate.
   KEDO sent a third site characterization team to the survey area near
Sinpo City in South Hamgyong Province on December 16. The 15-member team
plans to remain in North Korea for a month, during which time it will
gather information for a topographical map and prepare boring work for the
next step of the site survey, KEDO officials said.
   Of the estimated $4.5-billion cost to construct the two reactors, it is
expected that South Korea will contribute about $3-billionz, Japan about
$1-billion, and the U.S. and other KEDO members about $500,000, plus the
cost of continuing shipments of heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea in
the agreedment, one source noted. However, the exact amounts of money
pledged by the two major players, as well as smaller donations pledged by
other countries, have not been made public.
   A KEDO spokesman declined to comment on the organization's finances or
to provide information on the contributions provided by member nations or
contributing countries. A South Korean embassy official said December 19
that a decision on the amount South Korea will contribute to KEDO has not
been made yet, because the exact cost of the project is not yet known. The
official suggested that a decision might be made following the KEDO board
meeting planned for mid-January.
   Among the key issues to be worked out before construction can begin are
the details of how North Korea will repay South Korea for the financing.
The supply contract states that KEDO will finance the cost of the
construction and will be repaid by the DPRK, interest free, over 20 years,
inclusive of a three-year grace period, beginning with the completion of
each LWR.
   ``Repayment may be in cash, cash equivalents or through transfer of
goods,'' a KEDO release on the agreement stated.
   Under the supply contract, KEDO is to provide a radioactive waste
storage building for low- and medium-level waste with a 10-year storage
capacity for the two LWRs; nuclear fuel for the initial loading of each
plant, including such fuel rods as may be necessary to preserve safety for
initial operation; and technical support services for the first LWR for one
year after its completion.
   The DPRK further agrees: to allow the IAEA to resume ad hoc and routine
inspections of facilities not covered by the nuclear freeze when the supply
agreement was signed; to remain a party to the Treaty on the
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to allow implementation of
its safeguards agreement under the NPT; and to come into full compliance
with its IAEA safeguards agreement when a ``significant portion'' of the
LWR project is completed, but before the delivery of key nuclear
components.
   The DPRK also agrees: to conclude a bilateral agreement for peaceful
nuclear cooperation with the U.S. prior to the delivery of key nuclear
components, if U.S. firms provide such components; to transfer spent fuel
from the 5-MW reactor from North Korea when the delivery of key nuclear
components for the first LWR begins; and to begin dismantling its
graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities upon completion of the
first LWR, and to complete the dismantlement upon completion of the second
LWR.
   The contract further states that prior to shipment of any fuel
assemblies, the DPRK will observe the provisions of Convention on Nuclear
Safety, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the
Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological
Emergency, and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material.

CAMECO'S PORT HOPE REFINERY LICENSE RENEWED JUST DAYS BEFORE EXPIRATION

By:
Ray Silver, Toronto

   Cameco Corp.'s refinery at Port Hope, Ontario was granted a two-year
license renewal December 19, a dozen days before its operating permit would
have expired. The facility is the oldest of four large uranium processing
plants in the world.
   The license renewal had been deferred earlier in the month after area
residents voiced safety and environmental concerns at an Atomic Energy
Control Board meeting. Despite staff reports that the facility posed no
threat to the environment or to public health and safety, several residents
had concerns ranging from emergency response plans to the ultimate
decommissioning of the facility.
   The introduction of environmental issues into the license review
apparently stemmed from a 15-year debate on the disposal of low-level
refinery waste at Port Hope. The Port Hope license renewal was announced a
week after Canada's natural resources minister Anne McLellan said she would
ask the government early this year to consider a task force recommendation
that radioactive Port Hope refinery waste be buried at Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd.'s Chalk River nuclear station.
   Cameco's predecessor company, Eldorado Nuclear, built the Port Hope
facility in 1932 to extract radium from pitchblende. The plant was modified
12 years later to refine the stockpiled residue and yellowcake to uranium
for the Manhattan Project in the U.S.
   In 1962 Eldorado began to produce uranium oxide (UO2) to fuel Candu
reactors and in 1969 to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for light water
reactors. Both uranium trioxide (U03) from Cameco's Blind River, Ontario
facility and uranium from other producers feed the Port Hope refinery,
which produces 8,000-9,500 metric tons of fuel a year, most of it as UF6
for LWRs in the U.S. and abroad.
