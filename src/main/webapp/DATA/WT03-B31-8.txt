SLANTS & TRENDS

     Back-to-back news reports on Jan. 2 and 3 speculated that Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos might yet become the first member of President
Bush's cabinet forced to leave office.  White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater denied the rumors Jan. 3, saying Cavazos "has done an outstanding
job."  When asked directly if Cavazos were leaving, the president's
spokesman replied, "He has the job as long as he wants it."  Similar rumors
seven months ago had also been denied, when the president himself said
Cavazos "has my full confidence."

     The rumors resurfaced Jan. 2, when columnist Jack Anderson reported
that Cavazos might be on the way out because some "Washington insiders"
felt that his low-key style had failed to help build Bush's reputation as
"the education president."  Cavazos' style was compared to that of his
outspoken and combative predecessor, William Bennett.  Anderson said
Cavazos had also alienated Congressional Democrats and education interest
groups for not pushing harder for higher spending on education.  The
columnist said unnamed "White House operatives" were scouting for a
replacement for Cavazos, with outgoing New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean (R) and
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander (R) among their candidates.

     On Jan. 3, The Washington Post carried a similar story on its front
page, including more criticisms of Cavazos.  The criticisms from liberals
were largely predictable, but even Jeanne Allen, education policy analyst
at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, "We don't need a mellow
secretary.  We need somebody to really rock and roll.  He just doesn't know
policy."  The Post also quoted Cavazos' reaction to his critics, offered
during an interview with the paper:  "I'm just going to keep on doing my
job.  They can just line it up and have at it, because I'm going to have
right back at them."

     Later that same day, while denying rumors of Cavazos' imminent
departure, Fitzwater said criticisms of the secretary were "unfair," and
alleged that "action interest groups were trying to stimulate" Cavazos'
ouster.  As of RLP press time, Cavazos still had his job.

GOVERNORS' ASSN. TO HOLD THIRD ANNUAL CONFERENCE
ON STATE LITERACY INITIATIVES IN HARRISBURG, PA.

     The National Governors' Association (NGA), in cooperation with the
U.S. Department of Education and Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), will
sponsor the third annual conference on state literacy initiatives April 2-4
in Harrisburg, Pa.  The theme of the conference will be "Alliances for
Literacy," and it will focus on the development of state literacy policies
and the implementation of state-wide literacy systems.

     The three-day meeting is expected to draw more than 400 participants,
ranging from governors and their spouses to new adult readers.  Others
will include representatives from governors' offices, state literacy
agencies, nonprofit organizations, the business community, organized
labor, education, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Departments of Education,
Health and Human Services, and Labor.  Organizers say they also hope
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen.
Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio) will attend.

     While a detailed agenda is still in the works, organizers say
conference workshops will be divided into three tracks:  Targeting
Services, Creating an Infrastructure and Evaluating Effectiveness.  Because
some state programs are further along than others, workshops are being
planned that will address various stages of program implementation.
Conference plenary sessions will be devoted to national literacy issues
that are relevant to state efforts.

     For further information, contact Bob Silvanik at the NGA, Hall of the
States, 444 North Capitol St., N.W., Suite 250, Washington, D.C. 20001;
(202) 624-5353.

GOVERNORS SET TO ADOPT NATIONAL EDUCATION
GOALS AND RECOMMEND AGENDA FOR ACTION

     Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad (R), chairman of the National Governors'
Association (NGA), says the nation's governors will not only adopt
education goals at their annual winter meeting in February, they will also
issue an action agenda outlining the steps needed to acheive those goals.
(See RLP, Dec. 14)

     Branstad issued a statement Dec. 27 in which he said that the
governors' "education summit" with President Bush in September had
"produced an action agenda in four areas:  building national goals,
providing more flexibility in federal education programs, restructuring
education and improving accountability.  First, we will adopt national
goals for excellence in education.  Then, we will outline the process for
achieving the rest of our agenda."

     Branstad said the NGA task force on education will develop an action
agenda for the governors and the nation and issue it at the Feb. 25-27 NGA
meeting in Washington.  According to the NGA, the agenda will describe the
problems of education and the issues facing state policymakers, outline a
consensus on reasonable and achievable goals, and recommend practical ways
to acheive those goals.

     One of the broad goals set forth at the September summit was the
acheivement of "functional literacy" by all adult Americans.  Other broad
goals addressed the gammut of educational issues, from preschool through
college.  In the intervening months, the NGA education task force has been
involved in a joint effort with Bush administration officials to develop
more specific goals.

NATIONAL 'REPORT CARD' SHOWS STUDENTS'
READING AND WRITING ABILITIES REMAIN LOW

     "The reading and writing skills of American students remain dreadfully
inadequate," said Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos Jan. 9.  Cavazos was
speaking at a Washington news conference to announce the results of
nationwide studies on reading and writing conducted in 1988 by the
federally-funded National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  The
NAEP is conducted by the Educational Testing Service under a grant from the
Education Department's Office of Educational Research and Improvement.
(See related story, RLP, Oct. 19)

     Cavazos said that, overall, the reading and writing performance of
nine-, 13- and 17-year-olds remained "virtually unchanged" since the last
assessment in 1984.  Among 17-year-olds, 58 percent still could not read at
the "adept" level, which is defined as having the ability to find,
understand, summarize and explain information in materials like 12th-grade
textbooks.  Writing abilities were similarly deficient, showing little
change since the first writing assessment in 1974.  Seventy-two percent of
17-year-olds could not write adequate responses on the least-difficult
persuasive-writing task in the 1988 study.

     One hopeful sign amid the otherwise bad news was that Black and
Hispanic students continued to make gains in reading achievement, although
they still lagged behind white students.  In writing, the performance gap
between minority and white students did not change for nine- and
17-year-olds, and while the gap was reduced slightly for 13-year-olds, the
reduction was caused by lower performance among the whites.  Officials
blamed poverty for the racial disparities.

     Reading from a prepared statement, Cavazos used the disappointing NAEP
results as a springboard to call for enactment of the Bush
administration's education agenda.  "We must give parents the right to
select the schools their children will attend, and let schools compete for
students...." he said.  "We must let parents, teachers and administrators
manage their classrooms and schools without interference from district,
state and federal governments."

     Cavazos read his statement at the beginning of the news conference,
then turned the meeting over to representatives of the NAEP for a detailed
explanation of the study results.  He left the room immediately, without
inviting questions from the scores of reporters in attendance.

     But during a later question-and-answer session, a reporter compared
the lack of educational progress during the 1980s with earlier gains, and
asked if the new study had not deliberately avoided criticism of Reagan-era
cutbacks in education programs.  Wilhelmina Delco, vice-chairman of the
National Assessment Governing Board and a Democratic member of the Texas
House of Representatives, used that opportunity to complain about cuts in
the Head Start program for pre-schoolers.  "The Head Start program has been
substantially diminished in some areas and even abolished in others," she
said.  "This was a working vehicle, and we would encourage efforts in this
direction to be advanced, not discarded."

     The NAEP will mail free copies of The Reading Report Card, 1971-88 and
The Writing Report Card, 1984-88 to some 20,000 education professionals and
policymakers.  To find out if you are on their list, and to order the
reports if you are not, contact Kent Ashworth, NAEP, P.O. Box 6710,
Princeton, N.J. 08541-6710; (800) 223-0267 or (609) 734-5890.  Those not on
the free distribution list will be charged $9 for the reading report and
$12 for the writing report, with shipping and handling charges included in
those prices.

NATIONAL COALITION FOR LITERACY
ELECTS NEW CHAIR, CONSIDERS POLICY ROLE

     Indiana University Education Professor Anabel Newman has succeeded
Literacy Volunteers of America (LVA) President Jinx Crouch as chair of the
National Coalition for Literacy.  Coalition members include nonprofit
literacy groups, government agencies and education trade groups.  It
promotes greater awareness of adult illiteracy, attempts to foster
communication between literacy providers, and assesses national literacy
needs and services.

     Newman says that in a departure from previous practice, the coalition
is about to become involved in the national literacy policy debate.  She
told RLP Jan. 10 that coalition leaders are working toward a consensus on
various issues, but they have yet to agree on any specific positions.  This
new tack presents a problem for the coalition's governmental members (see
below), who have said they cannot take part in advocacy or lobbying
efforts.

     Newman is director of the Reading Practicum Center at Indiana
University.  She is a member of the International Reading Association
(IRA), one of the coalition's member groups, and serves as chair of the
IRA's committee on International Literacy Year (ILY).  The United Nations
has designated 1990 as ILY in an effort to promote literacy throughout the
world.  (See RLP, Dec. 28)

     During her one-year term as chair of the coalition, Newman will act as
its central coordinator, prepare agendas for and chair coalition meetings,
and represent the coalition at various functions.  Newman can be contacted
at:  School of Education 211, Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind. 47405;
(812) 855-9160 (Reading Practicum Center), or 855-7167 (sec'y), or 855-0378
(School of Ed.).

     At its most recent meeting, the coalition accepted a request from ILY
organizers and agreed to publicize ILY in the United States.  The
coalition will put special emphasis on getting the word out to the literacy
community, in an effort to encourage local ILY observances.  A series of
articles written by coalition members will be published in the newsletters
of the coalition's member groups and in other periodicals.

     ABC network Vice President John Harr wrote one such article for
inclusion in the December issue of The Reader, the LVA newsletter.  Harr is
ABC's project director for Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), another coalition
member group.  In his article, Harr conceded that U.N. literacy conferences
in Bangkok and Geneva "might seem a little high-flown for local literacy
programs" in the U.S., but he went on to say that awareness of ILY
activities should be "a morale-builder" for local programs.

     Newman says the National Contact Center, another coalition member,
will function as a clearinghouse for ILY information.  The center will add
information about national and local ILY activities to its database and
respond to ILY-related inquiries.  The center may be reached via its
national literacy hotline number, (800) 228-8813, or by writing to P.O. Box
81826, Lincoln, Neb. 68501-1826.

     In addition to the LVA, the IRA, PLUS and the contact center, other
coalition members include the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor, the
ACTION agency, the National Commission on Libraries and Information
Science, Laubach Literacy Action, the American Library Association, the
American Association for Adult and Continuing Education, the Correctional
Education Association and the National Council of State Directors of Adult
Education.

SEN. MOYNIHAN BERATES ADMINISTRATION FOR FAILURE
TO NOMINATE HHS OFFICIAL TO RUN J.O.B.S. PROGRAM

     Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote to Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan Jan. 4 to express his "bitter
disappointment that the administration has still not nominated an Assistant
Secretary for Family Support."  Among other responsibilities, the
assistant secretary would be in charge of the Job Opportunities and Basic
Skills Training (JOBS) program for recipients of Aid to Families With
Dependent Children (AFDC).  (See RLP, Dec. 28)

     The assistant secretary's post was created by the Family Support Act
of 1988, a major overhaul of welfare programs that stresses job training
and education for welfare mothers.  Moynihan is chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, and he was the chief
Senate sponsor of the act, which was signed by President Reagan in October
of 1988.  At least 25 states have already implemented JOBS programs despite
the vacancy at HHS.

     In his recent letter to Sullivan, Moynihan wrote:  "The program must
be up and running nationwide by October 1, 1990.  And yet, there is still
no one to run it....  Is there some way we can help?  If you like, I will
be happy to hold a hearing of the subcommittee early in the new year in
order to give you a chance to explain your problem...."

     Sources told The Washington Post that the leading candidate for the
job is Gordon Johnson, director of the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Services.  A Sullivan spokesman told RLP that the secretary is
eager to complete the selection process, but would only confirm that
Johnson is "a candidate."

CENSUS BUREAU WILL MAKE SPECIAL EFFORT TO INCLUDE
ILLITERATE, HOMELESS AND DISABLED PEOPLE IN 1990 COUNT

     The Census Bureau says it will make special efforts to include such
groups as illiterate adults, the homeless, and the disabled in the 1990
census.  The bureau says it will not attempt an actual headcount of
illiterate or homeless people as such, but some census forms will ask about
languages spoken at home.  The bureau reasons that many illiterate and/or
homeless people would be reluctant to answer questions about their status,
rendering any attempted headcount highly unreliable.  Census officials also
say that, in the absence of universally accepted definitions of
"illiteracy" and "homelessness," they will not attempt to come up with
their own.

     The 1990 census is being called a "do-it-yourself" count because it
will be conducted almost entirely by mail.  Five out of six households will
receive a short form containing 14 questions.  The rest, about 17 million
households, will receive a long form with 59 questions.  (It is these long
forms that will include questions about languages and disabilities.)

     The bureau will feature the "Census '90" logo prominently in a planned
advertising campaign, in the hope that people will recognize it when their
forms arrive in the mail.  The forms will include a toll-free telephone
number for anyone who needs help filling them out, and the bureau has also
arranged to set up hundreds of walk-in assistance centers across the
country.

     Households that do not return census forms will be visited by
"enumerators" from the bureau.  Also, special teams of enumerators will
interview some homeless "street people" at pre-identified sites, but these
interviews are designed to collect sample data only, not to produce a
definitive count.

     MARYLAND -- School officials in Prince George's County have not had

     MARYLAND -- School officials in Prince George's County have not had
any employers take them up on their "student-back guarantee" so far,
according to a report in the Greenbelt News Review.  Last June, the
district, which borders Washington, D.C., issued certificates of
employability to more than 2,500 graduating seniors who had been enrolled
in a variety of career education programs -- more than a third of all
graduates.  The wallet-size certificates guarantee potential employers
that the students have learned essential basic skills, including specific
competencies in reading, writing, math and verbal communication.  The
students are also guaranteed to have mastered work habits and attitudes,
interpersonal relationships, reasoning and problem-solving.  If a
"guaranteed" graduate fails to measure up, the district has promised to
provide job counselling and retraining at no cost to the employer.
Initial success has prompted efforts to attract even more students and
businesses into the program this year.

     NEW YORK -- For the first time, high school students trying to gain
admission to state colleges and universities will be allowed to use
calculators on the math portion of New York State's Regents exams next
year.  Fred Paul, head of the state Education Department's mathematics
bureau, said of the decision:  "It's an everyday situation where people
have them, they're going to use them, and we're just going to acknowledge
that."  Paul said the calculators will not give a significant advantage to
students who use them, because most of the Regents math questions require
problem-solving skills, not just arithmetic skills.  Students will still be
required to show the work involved in reaching their answers.

     PENNSYLVANIA -- Field screening of clients referred to the public

     PENNSYLVANIA -- Field screening of clients referred to the public
defender's office in Pittsburgh from June through November revealed that
only 51 percent of the clients could read at the ninth-grade level or
better.  Eight percent of the clients had a fourth-grade or lower reading
ability, while 41 percent were able to read at the fifth- to eighth-grade
levels.  The results were reported in On-Line Literacy, the newsletter of
the Pittsburgh Literacy Initiative.  The group said the statistics
indicated a need to integrate remedial education programs into court
sentencing procedures.  (See RLP, Dec. 14)

     The Philip Morris Companies will donate $1.5 million and the Pew
Charitable Trusts will donate $600,000 to form a private/public
partnership with the Mayor's Commission on Literacy in Philadelphia.  The
commission is an umbrella organization for adult literacy services.  The
money will fund a three-year initiative aimed at a significant reduction in
adult illiteracy.  According to reports, nearly 40 percent of the city's
adults have inadequate literacy skills.  Philip Morris will also fund a
local literacy-awareness advertising campaign.

     VIRGINIA -- The state's public/private Literacy Initiative, championed

     VIRGINIA -- The state's public/private Literacy Initiative, championed
by outgoing first lady Jeannie Baliles since 1986, is credited with helping
Virginia move from 48th place in the nation to 34th in terms of funding
for adult basic education and literacy.  While new programs are reaching
only five percent of the 668,000 Virginians over 25 who have less than a
ninth-grade education, only two percent received instruction before the
initiative.  State funding for literacy programs has jumped from $20,000
in the 1986-87 academic year to $270,000 in '87-88, and to a budgeted $4.25
million for the '88-90 two-year period.  Enrollment in adult education
programs nearly doubled between '87-88 and '88-89, and the adult dropout
rate has gone from 50 to 28 percent.  Only eight businesses had workplace
literacy programs four years ago, but 44 have them now.  Since 1985, the
number of private volunteer programs has also more than doubled, from 34 to
80; the number of trained volunteer tutors has jumped from 1,700 to 3,500;
and the number of students in volunteer programs has gone from 1,500 to
3,452.
