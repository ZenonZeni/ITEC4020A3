<p> After mowing fibre hemp in September, field-drying is
weather-dependent and therefore not reliable under Dutch weather
conditions. Direct harvesting can be done by field choppers
equipped with a row-independent header. Storage and preservation
of the wet material on the farm is possible under acid and
alkaline anaerobic conditions. No losses of cellulose were
measured, but fibre strength was decreased. Bark and core can
easily be separated by water flotation of the preserved chopped
stems. Decortication of the stems in the field was less effective
and would be more expensive. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1990, the Dutch government initiated a four year programme
to research the technical and economic feasibility of cultivating
fibre hemp for paper pulp. Both bast and core had to be processed
and the objective was to cultivate a crop with a maximum fibre
yield. This meant that harvest could not start before September
and that traditional harvesting methods might not be suitable. </p>

<h3>Available harvesting systems for tall fibre crops</h3>

<p>Fibre hemp is usually grown for textile fibres. For this
application, the strength, colour, softness and fineness of the
bast fibres are very important and harvesting technique focuses
on these aspects (for example, a retting process is necessary).
Because of the decreased demand for bast fibres, in most areas
the mechanization of bast fibre crops is not advanced. In the
Ukraine, hemp is mown and laid down in swaths to ret (van der
Werf 1994). In the USA, an experimental machine was developed to
cut kenaf. The stems were also laid down in a swath to ret or to
dry (USDA 1988). In Australia, sugar cane harvesters and field
choppers have been used to harvest kenaf for paper pulp (Wilkes <i>et
al.</i> 1969, Wood <i>et al</i>. 1978). Both types of machines
technically functioned well, but the harvest costs of a sugar
cane harvester were found to be much higher than those of a field
chopper. In the USA and Australia, initial attempts to start a
kenaf-processing industry failed.</p>

<p> In France, 6000 ha of fibre hemp is grown for processing into
paper pulp. Two harvesting systems are used, depending on whether
the seed is to be harvested or not (FNPC 1985). For the best and
highest fibre yield, the hemp is cut with a mower conditioner for
field drying in the third week of August. In about 4 days, the
moisture content is under 15% and the hemp is baled with a round
baler. However, if the seed is also to be harvested, the stem
tops are cut and threshed with a combine in the first week of
September. Subsequently, the crop is mown and laid down in a
swath to dry. With this second harvesting system the fibre yield
is much lower (depending on the cutting height of the combine)
and because of poor weather conditions in September, the fibre
quality can be lower. </p>

<h3>Research objectives</h3>

<p>From the beginning of the Dutch Hemp Research Programme, two
specific research topics were formulated. First, a system for
preservation and storage of the harvest was needed so as to
enable supply of pulp processing plants with fibres for the whole
year. Because hemp may not be harvested dry, many experiments
were performed concerning the preservation and storage of wet
hemp. Secondly, the processing of hemp into paper pulp demands a
separation of bark and core because these fractions differ
physically (fibre length and diameter) and chemically (cellulose
and lignin content) (Zomers <i>et al</i>. 1991). The separation
may be done as a harvest operation in the field or as a
preprocessing step of the pulping. The Institute of Agricultural
and Environmental Engineering (IMAG-DLO), together with the
Department of Agricultural Engineering and Physics of the
Wageningen Agricultural University, investigated these aspects to
determine the best processing chain in which harvest,
preservation, storage and bark/core separation are integrated. </p>

<h2>Materials and methods</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>Field tests were carried out with a cutter bar, a mower
conditioner, balers, field choppers and a decorticator. All
machines, except the decorticator, are commonly used in other
crops. When relevant and necessary, minor adaptions were made to
make them suitable for hemp. The main objective of the field
tests was to learn and solve the difficulties in handling a fibre
hemp crop utilizing different techniques.</p>

<p> We investigated the possibility of wet preservation by
anaerobic storage. The hemp stems were cut in short pieces (1 cm)
and preserved in bottles of 1.5&nbsp;l capacity. After flushing
with nitrogen, the bottles were closed air tight. To create
different environments, we used the following additives: <i>Foraform </i>(Barenbrug
Holland BV), a silage additive consisting primarily (92%) of
formic acid; kitchen salt; sodium hydroxide; and <i>Silage
inoculant 1188</i> (Pioneer Hi-bred Nederland BV), a silage
additive containing <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Streptococcus
facium</i>. After preservation, pH was measured of a 1:10 aquatic
extract. The cellulose and hemicellulose sugars and the lignin
were determined using an analysis derived from TAPPI-249 and
TAPPI-222 (de Maeyer and Huisman 1994). Bast fibres were cooked
for 1 hour in a 2% sodium hydroxide solution and the strength was
measured in a controlled environment (23<sup>o</sup> C, relative
humidity 50%) with a stelometer according to ASTM D-1445 (ASTM
1967). </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<p>We used 3 methods to separate bark and core: decortication of
green stems in the field, sieving of chopped stems, and flotation
of chopped stems. The decorticator broke the core of whole stems
and beat the core pieces from the bark. The sieving and flotation
of chopped stems were done after a 6 month wet preservation
period. The sieve dimensions were 2 x 4 cm. With flotation, the
hemp was thrown into a bath of slow moving water in which part of
the pieces floated and the rest sank. By measuring bark and core
masses, we determined the efficiency of each operation. </p>

<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>For storage of dry hemp, the moisture content must be less
than 15% to avoid fibre decay by micro-organisms. In France,
field drying takes at least 4 days for the crop to reach the
necessary dry matter (dm) content of 85%. Comparing weather data
from two Dutch and two French weather stations, we estimate that
in the Netherlands, on average, 6 days of dry weather in
succession are needed to have the hemp sufficiently dried. Based
upon data of the workability of the grain harvest (Portiek 1975),
in September for 9 out of 10 years, only 3.5 days are available
to harvest winter wheat with a moisture content below 24%. If the
moisture content of wheat is higher than 23%, it is not expected
that a mown hemp crop, lying on the ground, will reach the
necessary moisture content of less than 15%. So, in September,
the field drying period would be longer than 6 days for many of
the years and the crop would start dew retting. This would
decrease bast fibre strength (Hessler 1945, Robinson 1946). If
the crop stays wet, retting can even become rotting. So, we
concluded that field drying is not reliable in the Netherlands in
September.</p>

<p> Chopping of the standing crop is less weather dependent and a
field chopper with a row independent header can mow the crop
easily. Fewer problems occurred with a drum type chopper than
with a flywheel type chopper. To avoid blockages, the crop chute
must be smooth and without any augers or blind areas. The knives
must be sharp and the chopping length set short (6&nbsp;mm). To
handle hemp, great attention has to be paid to avoid bark
wrapping around rotating machine parts.</p>

<p> After chopping, the hemp has a dm content of 33%. Artificial
drying is too expensive, so we tried to preserve the hemp by
ensiling (wet anaerobic preservation). In corn or grass silages,
lactic acid bacteria consume available sugars and produce lactic
acid to yield a pH of 4.2. Then the product is preserved and no
further losses occur (McDonald <i>et al</i>. 1991). In hemp
silage, the pH did not drop to 4.2, even after addition of lactic
acid bacteria. The reason for this was lack of the necessary
sugars. Only 4 g of sugars per kg of stem dm were available and
based upon grass silage, about 75 g are needed for a sufficient
fermentation (Wieringa 1961). Despite the inadequate
fermentation, no cellulose or hemicellulose was lost in silage
(Table 1). Only with the addition of sodium hydroxide did some
hemicellulose and lignin dissolve. This was also shown by de
Groot <i>et al</i>. (1994). Impregnation of hemp core, during 30
minutes with 1 M sodium hydroxide at 20<sup>o</sup> C, removed
some xylan (the main component of the hemicellulose) and some
lignin.</p>

<p> It is important to maintain fibre strength when processing
the bast for paper pulp. Paper tensile strength is positively
correlated with the quantity and the quality of the bast fibres.
The bast fibre strength was best preserved in an acidic
(pH&lt;4.5) or alkaline (pH&gt;12) environment (Table 2).
However, even under these circumstances fibre strength decreased.
Because the control fibres, after 3 and 6 months, were not the
same (dry compared to frozen fibres), no clear results can be
given on the decrease of fibre stength in time. However, the big
difference between the data after 3 and 6 months' storage
indicate that fibre strength may be slowly decreasing, even in a
stable acidic or alkaline environment. More research is necessary
to determine how much this strength decreases and whether this
decrease can be stopped. </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<pre>Figure 1 presents the results of decortication in the field and the separation of bark and core after chopping and ensiling, by sieving or by flotation. With decortication, the bark could not be cleaned well enough and still contained more than 40% of the core. About two thirds of this core was not attached to the bark. Bark and loose core should be easily separable by sieving since the size of the bark and of the loose core pieces greatly differ. The length of the core pieces ranged from 1 to 8 cm and the length of the bark from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The quantity of the remaining fixed core would be very difficult to reduce. It was clear that the quantity of fixed core mainly depended on stem diameter: the smaller the diameter, the higher the quantity of fixed core.</pre>

<p> With field chopping, the bark was not cut as short as the
core. The bark was very tough and the knives stripped some of the
bark from the core. So after chopping, about 90% of the mixture
consisted of clean bark and core pieces. This made it possible to
separate bark and core by sieving or flotation. Sieving of
chopped hemp resulted in a 'contamination rate' of both bark and
core of about 25%, since the size difference between the chopped
bark and core was not big enough to separate them by sieving.
With flotation, very clean bast could be collected, although some
bark floated because it stuck to a piece of core, resulting in
its collection with the core.</p>

<p> A disadvantage of decortication is the low processing
capacity. The costs would be high, approximately 110 Dfl per ton
of dm, especially because the machine only can be used in hemp.
Flotation seems most satisfactory and would cost approximately 5
Dfl per ton of dm. It is expected that a simple chopping
operation of the floating material can reduce the mass of bark in
the core. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<pre>Field choppers equipped with a row-independent header can harvest fibre hemp, but the sharpness of the knives and the throughput of the chopped fibres need special attention to prevent wrapping or blocking. The chopping operation loosens about 90% of the bark and core. Because the bark sinks in water and the core floats, flotation is an easy and effective separation method. This operation perfectly fits into a harvesting system with chopping and ensiling. In a system of cultivation, harvest and storage of fibre hemp, wet anaerobic preservation is the most uncertain factor for the supply of consistent good-quality fibres throughout the year. Acidic and alkaline preservation techniques seem to be the best methods, but more research is needed on these processes, with special attention paid to the observed decrease in fibre strength.
