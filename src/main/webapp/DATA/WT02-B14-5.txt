<a name="RTFToC2">Illegal
Immigration and the Peso
Devaluation</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Experts predicted in 1994 that Operation Gatekeeper would reduce illegal
immigration from Mexico.  But then came the 50 percent devaluation of the
Mexican peso, and the number of aliens apprehended jumped in January and
February 1995 over 30 percent above year earlier levels, with especially sharp
increases in apprehensions in Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>The spring and summer of 1995 will provide a test of how well beefed-up US
border controls can cope with sharp increases in Mexican emigration pressures.
The peso has lost about 50 percent of its value since December 20, 1994,
widening the US-Mexican wage gap from 8 to 1 to about 12 to 1 (wages in Mexico
have been raised).  In addition, up to 10 percent of the 10 million Mexicans
who have formal sector jobs may lose them.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been several attempts to project Mexico to US migration in 1995.
Princeton demographer Tom Espenshade, who puts the annual flow of unauthorized
Mexicans in the US sometime during a typical year at 1.5 to 3 million,
predicted for the US Treasury, an annual increase of 460,000 illegal border
crossers including about 40,000 who would settle in the United States.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most US migration researchers agree with Espenshade that unauthorized
Mexico-to-US migration is likely to rise in 1995.  Both UCSD's Wayne Cornelius
and University of Pennsylvania's Doug Massey, for example, report that in the
Mexican villages from which most migrants come "bags are packed" for the trek
north--stepped up border controls, they argue, are not likely to deter
migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>In a January 1995 survey, Cornelius found that 30 percent of the Mexicans
questioned thought that "it was not at all difficult" to find a job as an
illegal alien in the US, while 28 percent thought that it was "very difficult."
Over 80 percent of the Mexicans interviewed by Cornelius had heard of Operation
Gatekeeper, and 80 percent thought that it was now more difficult to enter the
US, but over 70 percent of those who had worked in the US in recent years were
thinking of migrating to the US in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on February 24, 1995 said that some of the
undocumented immigrants being apprehended by INS agents have said they crossed
the border because of plant closings or other job losses related to the peso
devaluation.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Mexican researchers, on the other hand, argue that suddenly poorer
Mexicans may not be able to finance the trip to the US.  Jorge Bustamante,
President of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), a Mexican research
center in Ensenada, said the number might actually drop because the cost of
traveling to the United States has increased by about 50 percent.  In one
report, the average cost of being smuggled from Tijuana to Los Angeles rose
from about $300 to $450.  </tt><p>
<tt>COLEF researchers monitoring illegal border crossings from Mexico report
that, as a result of Operation Gatekeeper, aliens must often make four or five
rather than just one or two entry attempts.  However, there is no indication
that the need to make multiple entry attempts has so far deterred large numbers
of illegal entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Cornelius emphasizes that so many migrants have left rural Mexico and
settled in the US since 1986 that there is not much "migration potential" left
in many traditional emigration areas.  Moreover, settlement in the US has also
reduced remittances to communities of origin, increasing the migration
potential of those who remain.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been three major peso devaluations in the past 15 years, and
each has produced a distinct migration response.  In 1982-83, Mexico also
experienced a sharp peso devaluation (70 percent), but much of the adjustment
took the form of lower real wages in urban areas rather than open unemployment.
In rural areas, it took 16 months of a cost-price squeeze on farmers to produce
a significant increase in apprehensions. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1986-87, the US offered amnesty or legal status to practically any rural
Mexican who had some US farm work experience.  Because of US legalization, the
mid-1980s peso devaluation was not associated with increased apprehensions in
1987.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994-95, by contrast, Nora Lustig of the Brookings Institution notes
that the adjustment seems to be taking the from of open unemployment in urban
areas, as manufacturing and other firms announce bankruptcies and layoffs.
Separations from good jobs seem to be concentrated in urban areas, while
emergency programs to alleviate the effects of devaluation seem to be
concentrated in rural areas.  The Mexican government plans to temporarily
employ 500,000 unemployed workers to build rural roads.  </tt><p>
<tt>If more urban-origin migrants head north in 1995, then a new set of
migration streams may be set in motion, promising more migration in the years
ahead.</tt><p>
<tt>As the number of apprehensions along the US-Mexican border rose 38 percent
to 118,000 in February 1995 in comparison to February 1994, US Border Patrol
agents report that violence against them has increased.  Seven of the nine
US-Mexican Border Patrol sectors--San Diego and El Centro, California; Yuma and
Tucson, Arizona; and El Paso, Del Rio, Marfa, Laredo, and McAllen, Texas--saw
apprehensions rise  (the Border Patrol divides US borders into 21 sectors).
These stations had 3,750 agents--or 88 percent of all agents-- in September
1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Agents reportedly have more rocks thrown at them, encounter nails driven
through boards to stop their vehicles, and often confront larger groups of
aliens being smuggled into the US.  Mexico has promised to expand its Grupo
Beta, which seeks to eliminate border crimes committed against aliens, but not
deter Mexicans from migrating illegally to the US, and to crack down harder on
smugglers of aliens (coyotes).</tt><p>
<tt>The US and the Mexican governments have launched a three-part study of the
magnitude, impacts, and solutions for unauthorized Mexico-to-US migration.  The
study was launched in February 1995, with Mexico and the US sharing its costs.
The aim is to reach consensus at each phase of the study--numbers,
characteristics, push-pull factors, impacts, and policy recommendations--before
proceeding to the next phase.</tt><p>

Naturalization</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>,
Greencards</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> and Family
Unity</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The number of immigrants electing to become naturalized US citizens jumped
75 percent in the first four months of 1995.  In FY94, some 558,139
applications were filed.  In the first quarter of FY95 (October-December 1994),
some 234,000 applications for naturalization were filed, almost a
million-a-year pace.  The Los Angeles INS district has been receiving 1,500 or
more naturalization applications every day in 1995, double the number in
1994--about half of California's naturalization applicants are believed to be
in the Los Angeles area.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the INS, an average 235,000 naturalization petitions were
filed in the late 1980s, and a similar number of aliens became naturalized US
citizens.  Petitions and naturalizations rose in the early 1990s:  there were
342,00 petitions filed in 1992, and 240,000 persons naturalized, and 522,000
petitions filed in FY93, when 315,000 persons naturalized.</tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons for the upsurge in naturalizations.  First, the
number of aliens eligible for naturalization is peaking, as those legalized in
1987-88 become eligible.  Second, Congress is debating measures to make non-US
citizens ineligible for many welfare benefits--many commentators asserted that
the upsurge in naturalization applications represented a backlash against
Congressional Republican attempts to deny benefits to non-citizens.  According
to the Department of Health and Human Services, some 2.2 million legal
immigrants would lose benefits if the Republican plan is approved.  Some assert
that a high percentage of persons naturalized tend to vote in the first
election after they receive voting rights, which would be 1996 for persons
naturalized in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, the INS is requiring the estimated one million aliens who arrived
before 1979 to replace by March 20, 1995 their I-551 Alien Identification or
green cards--between 1946 and 1964, the card was green.  The new I-551, which
costs $75, has a photo, fingerprint and signature--a naturalization application
costs $95, only $20 more.</tt><p>
<tt>There are more than 10 million immigrants in the US eligible to become US
citizens, and the INS has proposed a simplification of the rules under which
aliens can become naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Under current procedures, an alien 18 or older must be a permanent US
resident for at least five years, with no absences of more than a year, and
pass an English and civics test.  Aliens married to US citizens can become
naturalized US citizens after three years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Aliens wishing to become naturalized US citizens must complete a four-page
application form (N-400), be fingerprinted, and pay a fee of $95; they must
also be persons "of good moral character, attached to the principles of the
Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and
happiness of the United States."  </tt><p>
<tt>They are then scheduled to be interviewed and tested by an INS official for
their knowledge of English and US government--applicants are asked five to ten
of 100 questions on US history and government.  Aliens 50 and older with 20
years US residence, or 55 and older with 15 years residence, are offered a
simplified English test.</tt><p>
<tt>Most naturalization applicants take about 50 hours of instruction in
English and civics in classes organized by schools, churches, unions, and
Community-Based Organizations (CBOs).  CBOs and community colleges are already
permitted to certify an alien's knowledge of English.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS is considering a proposal to let CBOs certify an applicant's
knowledge of civics to reduce backlogs that have lengthened the wait between
petitioning for naturalization and the interview-test to six months or more.
Some CBOs believe the US government should subsidize their teaching and testing
of immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Most Mexican and Canadian immigrants who are eligible to become naturalized
US citizens do not do so for fear of losing legal and emotional links to
Mexico.  Mexican citizens lose their Mexican citizenship when they become US
citizens, and many Mexican immigrants falsely fear that loss of Mexican
citizenship might threaten their property rights in Mexico.  Mexico recently
changed its citizenship laws to permit Mexican citizens to reclaim Mexican
citizenship if they wish.  Some are pushing for both the US and Mexico to adopt
dual citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>In a settlement of a class-action suit on March 31, 1995, the INS and
immigration rights lawyers established new family unity guidelines in
immigration law.  Under the new standards, immigrants living continuously in
the US since May 5, 1988 may return to their home countries for visits without
fear that their naturalization applications will be denied.  </tt><p>
<tt>The settlement also affects undocumented family members of persons
legalized during the 1980s amnesty programs.  Under the family unity provision,
qualified undocumented immigrants who arrived two years before the cut-off date
of May 5, 1988, can receive renewable work authorization and protection from
deportation while their naturalization cases are considered. </tt><p>
<tt>In a related development, a federal judge in California dismissed an INS
effort to close the door on an estimated 300,000 illegal aliens who assert that
they failed to apply for legalization in 1987-88 because of an INS rule that,
to be eligible, illegal aliens had to live in the US CONTINUOUSLY since January
1, 1982.  The INS rule was later modified to permit "brief, casual, and
innocent" absences from the US but, on January 30, 1995, the INS announced that
it would no longer accept applications from illegal aliens who claim that they
were discouraged from applying for legalization.</tt><p>
<tt>The lawsuit, now in its ninth year, seeks to force the INS to permit
eligible "discouraged aliens" from applying for legalization.  Hundreds of
applications continue to be filed each month in Los Angeles and New
York.</tt><p>

<tt>Congress continued to hold hearings throughout March on proposals to reduce

269 on March 14, 1995.</tt><p>

Claims, has been holding weekly hearings on immigration issues.  Smith
announced that he would not support a House Republican plan to make legal
immigrants ineligible for welfare benefits, but that he would support measures
that would make sponsors of immigrants legally liable for supporting them until
the alien becomes a US citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) introduced a reform package on March 21 which
includes a $1.00 border crossing fee, increases in civil and criminal penalties
for forgers and makes document fraud an aggravated felony.  The measure would
also increase employer sanctions with fines ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 per
undocumented worker hired.  Current fines range from $250 to $2,000.
Feinstein's reform package also includes an employer verification system and
adding 2,100 Border Patrol agents. </tt><p>
<tt>Unlike the Simpson measure, the legislation does not call for reducing
legal immigration.  Feinstein has not endorsed Simpson's plan, although the two
measures are similar.  </tt><p>
<tt>The 41-member House Task Force on Immigration headed by Rep. Elton Gallegly
(R-CA) is due to make recommendations to reduce illegal immigration by June
1995, so that the House can hold hearings and approve immigration reform
legislation by September.  Gallegly asserted that his proposals would make it
tougher for illegal aliens to enter and work in the US, but he left open the
door to an expanded guest worker program to fill "legitimate" labor
needs.</tt><p>
<tt>The House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Government
Management, Information and Technology on March 7, 1995 heard about the INS
Telephone Verification System (TVS) Pilot system under which 200 employers in
industries likely to employ illegal aliens can call in newly hired workers'
A-numbers to verify their right to work.  Under TVS, an employer gains instant
access to the INS database, and can determine whether a newly-hired worker is
authorized to work in the US.  The employer punches in a code, the employee's
date of birth, and his or her A-number, and minutes later receives a report
from the INS on whether the A-number is valid, and whether it permits
employment.</tt><p>
<tt>In 70 percent of the cases, INS confirmed employment authorization right
away, and secondary verification took five to ten days.  The theory is that
fraudulent documents will lose their value, because the employer will in most
cases learn instantly that the worker is not authorized to work in the US.  The
INS system currently works only for aliens, and relies only on INS data.</tt><p>
<tt>If the worker is not authorized to work, the employer keeps the employee,
mails in a secondary verification form, and awaits the results of manual
verification.  This INS computer verification system is being extended from 9
businesses nationwide to 200 Los Angeles area employers in 1995-96, and to
1,000 in 1996-97.</tt><p>
<tt>On February 23, 1995 CIR Chair Barbara Jordan repeated before the House
Judiciary Committee's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee the CIR's
recommendation that pilot computer employee validation systems that combine
data from Social Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization
Service be tested to enable US employers to determine quickly if ALL
newly-hired workers are authorized to be employed in the United States.
According to a Harris poll, 53 percent of Americans in 1994 favor a national
work permit system for US citizens and authorized aliens, up from 46 percent in
1990.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>On February 22, 1995, the INS announced that it had detected over
5,000 aliens working in entry-level hotel, restaurant, construction, and
manufacturing jobs in Arizona after a 10-month investigation.  About 10 percent
of the 50,000 I-9 forms at 500 Arizona companies that were checked by the INS
were signed by workers not authorized to hold US jobs.  About 500 unauthorized
workers were deported, and 30 employers were fined $326,120.  According to the
INS, most employers were not purposely violating the employer sanctions
law.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR also called for better border management--deterring illegal
crossings while facilitating legal ones.  Jordan also emphasized that,
"Deportation is crucial.  Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in
one sentence: those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out,
are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to
leave."</tt><p>
<tt>About 333 million foreigners were admitted at 200 air, land, and sea ports
with legal visas in FY94, and 662,000 were denied entry to the US--90 percent
of the legal entries were over US land borders.  About 93 percent of all
nonimmigrants enter with visitor visas for pleasure or business. </tt><p>
<tt>Procedures for issuing visas vary from country to country, with
face-to-face interviews required in countries where fraud is common.  Visitors
from 22 countries coming to the United States for business or pleasure for up
to 90 days may be admitted without visas under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program.
Mexicans can receive border crossing cards, which permit them to travel within
25 miles of the border for up to 72 hours.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the estimated 300,000 visa overstayers in 1992, 60,000 were Mexicans,
18,000 Italians, 15,000 Filipinos, 13,000 Bahamians, and 9,000 Poles.
Lawfully-admitted nonimmigrants comprise approximately 33 percent of aliens
filing asylum applications with INS.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the British press, there are an estimated 150,000 illegal
alien workers from Britain in the US, and more are being apprehended in INS
raids on British-themed restaurants.  Most presented their US employers with
false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 14, House Republican leaders decided to bar legal immigrants only
from five of the 60-some federal assistance programs that would have become
off-limits to them under the original welfare reform proposal.  Legal
immigrants would be barred from the so-called Big 5 programs--Medicaid ($155
billion in federal-state costs per year), Food Stamps ($27 billion), Disability
aid, AFDC ($23 billion), and Title 20 social service programs--they would not
be barred from employment and training programs.  States would also gain more
power to require the sponsors of immigrants to repay the cost of any aid that
the immigrants receive.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the savings anticipated from welfare reform come from barring
non-citizens from welfare programs.  For example, if the proposed ban on non-US
citizens receiving AFDC is approved, the CBO estimates that about $2 billion
annually would be saved from the $23 billion federal-state AFDC program.
During the summer of 1993, about four million mothers were receiving AFDC
payments for 10 million children.  There were about 4.2 million foreign-born
mothers, and nine percent or 400,000 of them were receiving AFDC payments,
about the same as the 11 percent rate for US-born mothers.</tt><p>

and California Population
Growth</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The US population was estimated to be 260 million on July 1, 1994, up from
249 million in 1990.  There are about four million births annually, and two
million deaths, so that natural increase adds about two million Americans per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Net international migration adds another 770,000 residents per year,
according to Census estimates.  About 43 percent of the immigrants are
Hispanic, 30 percent are Asian, and 10 percent are Black.</tt><p>
<tt>The largest five states included 36 percent of all residents.  California,
with 31 million people (12 percent), Texas and, New York, 18 million each
(seven percent each), Florida, 14 million (five percent), and Pennsylvania, 12
million (almost five percent). </tt><p>
<tt>According to the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, California's employment
grew by almost two percent in 1994 to 12.2 million nonfarm employees, up from
the 1993 low of 12 million.  California's population, which had been growing by
almost three percent per year in 1989-90, is now growing by only one percent
per year--in 1994, net immigration to California is projected to be zero, the
first time in recent memory that as many people left the state as
entered.</tt><p>
<tt>Even though California's economy is turning up, 57 percent of Californians
in a March 1995 poll believed that the state was on the "wrong track."  A
majority of those polled thought that California's economy would get better in
two or three years, but one-third are not confident that they will have their
current jobs in six months.</tt><p>
<tt>Data on job attachment between 1973 and 1993 indicate that a stable 20
percent of American workers aged 45 to 54 have worked for the same company for
more than 20 years, and half of them have worked for the same employer for 10
or more years.  This apparent stability of job attachment seems to fly in the
face of stories of corporate cutbacks at companies such as IBM and Kodak that
used to offer "lifetime employment."  It may be that job attachment is
declining fastest among the less-educated men whose real earnings are also
declining, fueling the "angry white men" syndrome to which some attribute
Republican political victories.</tt><p>
<tt>Moving company records for 1994 indicate that almost twice as many families
were moved out of California as were moved in, 95,500 out, and 54,300 in.
However, California continues to receive enough immigrants so that, even if
twice as many residents leave California for Texas, Washington, Arizona, and
Colorado, the state's population grows as immigrants replace departing
Californians, and immigrants and resident Californians have babies.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Illegal
Alien Numbers
Revised</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>As Congress debates what to do to reduce illegal immigration, there were
several reviews of the level of illegal immigration, and the efforts of INS to
reduce it.</tt><p>
<tt>Demographer Jeff Passel notes that ESTIMATES of number of illegal aliens in
the US have fallen while the actual NUMBER increased.  For example, estimates
of six to 12 million illegal aliens were common in the late 1970s, even though
it was later estimated that about 2.1 illegal aliens were included in the 1980
Census.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1985, Passel estimated that there were three to five million illegal
aliens.  Some two million were legalized in 1987-88, or about two-thirds of the
illegal aliens in the US since 1982, and the number of illegal aliens was
estimated at 2.2 million in 1988.  However, the number then began to increase,
reaching an estimated 3.4 million in October 1992, and 4 million at the end of
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Between October 1986 and 1988, there was an especially sharp drop in the
number and share of Mexican illegal aliens because so many Mexicans were
legalized.  Mexicans dropped from about 58 percent to 38 percent of the total
population of illegal aliens in the US, and in California the estimated illegal
alien population fell from 2.9 million to 800,000.    </tt><p>
<tt>There are two broad strategies to combat illegal immigration.  What might
be called the "island" model is the policy of the UK and Australia, which have
strict entry controls, but neither residence permits nor employer sanctions.
The so-called "continental" strategy puts the primary emphasis on internal
controls, usually with residence and employment permits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US has traditionally relied on a continental strategy, relying
primarily on the Border Patrol to deter illegal entry, but an analysis by INS
statistician Bob Warren of data on aliens who entered the US legally, and then
stayed too long and became illegal aliens, suggests that most of the 3.4
million illegal aliens who were believed to be living in the US in October 1992
entered the US legally.  These data suggest that the US may be pushed to move
toward both island and continental strategies, beefing up both border controls
and internal controls.  The number of illegal aliens was increasing by about
300,000 per year between 1988 and 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS in August 1994 adopted a strategic plan that shifts the focus from
apprehending aliens to preventing the entry of illegal aliens.  Some in
Congress are pressing the INS to adopt the El Paso Hold-the-Line strategy of
flooding the border with agents to deter illegal entries in California.
According to some estimates, 8,000 to 9,000 agents concentrated on the 165
miles of border through which most illegals enter could dramatically reduce
illegal immigration.  The INS counters that Hold the Line is not appropriate in
San Diego, where an estimated 99 percent of the illegal alien entrants are
passing en route to an interior location such as Los Angeles, versus 35 percent
in El Paso.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the INS, the San Diego strategy of using three lines of agents
to apprehend all illegal entrants IS working.  Aliens apprehended report that
the price of being smuggled to Los Angeles has jumped 50 percent, from $300 to
$450, and the GAO agreed with the INS in testimony on March 10 that smugglers
are attempting to bring aliens into the US in other areas, especially
Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>In FY 93, the San Diego and El Paso Border Patrol sectors accounted for
two-thirds of the 1.2 million southwest border apprehensions.  In FY92, over
half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600
border miles--13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico,
and five miles along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.  In
response to the INS's new border control strategies, in FY94, the San Diego and
El Paso's share of total southwest border apprehensions dropped from two-thirds
in fiscal year 1993 to about one-half in fiscal year 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Border Patrol reopened in March the checkpoint on Interstate 5, 66
miles north of the US-Mexican border, to determine how many illegal aliens were
getting into the US despite Operation Gatekeeper.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">CIR
Considers Immigration's Impacts on US Labor
Markets</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>At a CIR hearing February 23, a Department of Labor representative urged
the CIR to reduce employment-based immigration in order to balance employers'
needs for international labor market access with the need to invest in
education and job training for US workers.  Several CIR commissioners argued
that more rather than fewer immigrants should be selected on the basis of US
employer needs, but DOL argued that, if the US continues to admit large numbers
of foreign scientists and engineers, 20 years from now even more will be needed
because the US will have given up on ways to interest young people in these
careers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Also on February 23, the CIR heard George Borjas, a professor at the
University of California, San Diego, argue that 20 percent of the wage gap
between less-skilled and more skilled workers in the United States is due to
the presence of the most recent wave of immigrants, legal and illegal, who have
fewer skills than previous generations of immigrants.  Vernon Briggs of Cornell
University argued that the labor market is being buffeted by changes such as
defense cutbacks, echo baby boomers entering the labor market, and more women
working for wages, and that, immigration today is "far too high for labor
market needs."</tt><p>
<tt>Harriet Orcutt Duleep of the Urban Institute argued that only illegal
immigrants and refugees have low levels of education, although her analysis
excluded all Mexican immigrants because it was hard to separate legal and
illegal Mexican immigrants in the data used.  Markley Roberts of the AFL-CIO
argued that DOL should do an even better job of labor
certification--determining that American workers were truly not available
before allowing US employers to hire foreign workers.  DOL finds that employers
are often employing the same foreign workers illegally that they are requesting
DOL to certify that they need.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of US engineers and computer programmers argued that the US
is permitting the entry of foreigners to fill jobs even though there are large
numbers of unemployed American engineers and programmers.  US employers, they
argued, use temporary foreign workers because they are cheaper and easier to
recruit.  It was noted that entry-level engineering salaries have fallen three
percent between 1974 and 1994, from $35,700 to $34,700 in 1994 dollars.  The
real wages of more experienced engineers fell even more.  An engineer with a
Master's degree and 25 years experience made $78,600 in 1974 (in 1994 dollars),
and $71, 400 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In a critical review of DOL labor certification procedures, a Boston firm
attempting to hire a British alien who did not have a BA degree, and thus did
qualify for a professional employment visa, reportedly spent $10,000 and six
months before securing a temporary visa for the British worker.  As the story
makes clear, US employers think that the tough part is finding the ideal
foreign candidate for a vacant job; US labor certification procedures, they
feel, are simply a bureaucratic obstacle to getting the foreign worker they
feel is needed.</tt><p>
<tt>A US employer who wants to bring into the US temporary foreign workers must
file two applications for alien labor certification with the Department of
Labor.  The first, labeled an ETA-750A, specifies the terms and salary of the
particular job; the second, called an ETA-750B and filled out by the would-be
recruit, lists the applicant's qualifications.  The local Employment Service
(ES) office where the employer files the application then does a prevailing
wage survey to ensure that the employer is offering the going wage.  </tt><p>
<tt>After the ES approves the wage offer, the employer is required to do three
kinds of recruiting: The employer has to place an ad for the job with the
employment department for 30 days, within its own offices for 10 days, and in
an "appropriate publication" for no less than three consecutive days.  When US
citizens and legal immigrants respond to the ads, the employer is required to
provide the employment department with "lawful, job-related reasons" for not
choosing them.</tt><p>
<tt>Janitors are the largest single occupation in the US in which a majority of
the workers are probably immigrants, and the 10-year Justice for Janitors
campaign of the Service Employees International Union is moving from cities
such as Los Angeles, New York, San Jose, and San Francisco, where a majority of
the janitors are SEIO members, to smaller cities such as Sacramento.  Non-union
janitors typically earn about $5 per hour and have few benefits; unionized
janitors earn $7 to $8 and have benefits such as health insurance and pensions.
Justice for Janitors typically targets corporations with household names that
hire their janitors through contractors.

<tt>The US Information Agency modified on February 14, 1995 regulations under
which 10,000 European au pairs enter the US each year.  USIA had proposed
requiring that the weekly stipend be raised from $100 to $155, but reduced the
stipend to $115.  USIA dropped the proposed requirement that au pairs be at
least 21 to care for children under two, and the proposed requirement that they
be limited to nine hours of work daily (the limit is 45 hours weekly).  The au
pair program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 1995.</a></a></a></a></a>

Activities to Deter Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Prop. 187 in California may have marked a new era in state and local
government activism to reduce illegal immigration.  Virginia is estimating the
number and cost of illegal immigrants in order to seek federal reimbursement,
and Maryland has held hearings on whether English should be the official state
language.</tt><p>
<tt>In Florida, the Orlando-based group Save Our State is planning to put an
initiative on the November 1996 ballot to withhold publicly-funded services
from unauthorized aliens.  It needs 50,000 signatures to have the proposed
constitutional amendment reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court, and 430,000
signatures to put the measure on the ballot.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, a federal judge on March 13 scheduled a trial for September
6, 1995 on the constitutionality of Proposition 187.  The State of California
had sought to have the constitutionality of Proposition 187 determined first in
California state courts.  A bill has been introduced in Congress to require
three rather than one federal judge to agree to issue an injunction to block
the implementation of a voter-approved initiative.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a Los Angeles Times poll that included non-voters and non-US
citizens, most Californians think that the passage of Prop. 187 was a good
thing. Most want Prop. 187 to be implemented immediately; 52 percent want Prop.
187 implemented immediately, while 38 percent do not.  Only Latinos--by 54
percent to 35 percent--do not want Prop. 187 implemented immediately.</tt><p>
<tt>By 53 percent to 40 percent, those questioned thought that passage of Prop.
187 was a "good thing."  Only nine percent of those questioned thought that
there had been a major increase in discrimination since the passage of Prop.
187.</tt><p>
<tt>Yale law professor Peter Schuck reviews the likelihood that the courts will
eventually uphold 187, and notes that there is ample precedent for the US
Supreme Court to uphold or to strike down the proposition.  Schuck believes
that it would be wrong to uphold 187, largely because the optimal level of
illegal immigration is not zero--it costs too much to completely stop
immigration--and so the illegal aliens who inevitably arrive should receive
public education and emergency health care.  </tt><p>
<tt>Schuck also believes that it would be foolish to make ineligible for
welfare benefits legal immigrants in the US, since, he asserts, Congress can
discriminate against legal immigrants in welfare programs, but the states
cannot without Congressional approval, so that a federal ban may wind up simply
increasing state and local costs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are currently four bills before Congress that would declare English
to be the official national language.  Under English-only rules, bilingual
ballots are banned, government documents are printed only in English, and
government workers must speak English at work.  Three of the four bills would
also abolish Bilingual programs in the US Education Department. </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson announced that he would "explore" seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, and signaled that two of his themes
would be opposition to illegal immigration and affirmative action.  However,
President Clinton responded that "some" who supported Prop. 187 in 1994 to
reduce illegal immigration had laid the ground work for illegal immigration in
1984-85, when Congress approved an "easy" farm worker legalization program that
permitted over half of the mostly young Mexican men who became legal US
immigrants to gain that status fraudulently.  </tt><p>
<tt>If illegal immigration becomes a major issue in the 1996 campaign, the
1983-86 campaign by western growers for a "free agent" guest worker program is
likely to be scrutinized closely.  The kingpin was Rep. Coehlo (D-CA) who
arranged to have former Rep. Panetta, currently Clinton's chief of staff, carry
a bill that would have permitted Mexican workers to enter the US and "float"
from farm to farm as needed.  After the House approved such a program in 1994,
then Senator Wilson persuaded the Senate to approve a similar program in 1985.
</tt><p>
<tt>Unions, churches, and ethnic organizations strongly opposed these
non-immigrant programs, setting the stage for the last-minute compromise in
1986--a legalization program for all unauthorized workers who had a minimal

<a name="RTFToC9">California
Farm Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On March 31, the United Farm Workers Union held events around the nation to
honor the anniversary of the death of UFW founder Cesar Chavez.  </tt><p>
<tt>Farm workers are one of only three US occupations with one million or more
workers in which the majority of workers are immigrants--the other two are
maids and janitors.  There are two to three million farm workers, including
about 800,000 persons who work for wages sometime during each year on
California farms.  About half of these California farm workers might be
considered dependent on farm work for most of their earnings--a typical
California farm worker earns about $5 hourly for about 1,000 hours of work, for
$5,000 in annual farm earnings.</tt><p>
<tt>For over 100 years, most California farm workers have been persons who
could not obtain any other jobs in California, usually because they lacked
English, skills, and contacts.  In 1965, Cesar Chavez organized a strike by
California grape harvesters to protest grower refusal to pay mostly local
workers the same wages that they were required to pay to non-immigrant Mexican
workers and, since the Bracero program ended in 1964, Chavez's United Farm
Workers was able in 1966 to win a 40 percent wage increase.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1975, California became the first major agricultural state to enact a
law that granted farm workers the right to organize into unions, and required
employers to bargain with the union representative elected by workers.  During
the next 20 years, there were about 1,200 elections involving 100,000
workers--the same worker could vote in several elections--but one-third of
these elections were held in the last five months of  1975.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration marked the rise and fall of the UFW.  In 1980, the UFW asked
for another 40 percent increase.  After a bitter strike that saw growers turn
to  labor contractors who organized crews of often illegal workers to be strike
breakers, the UFW won an Pyretic victory--many companies that agreed to UFW
demands went out of business.  UFW membership fell from a peak of perhaps
60,000 in the late 1970s to as few as 5,000 in the early 1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>The UFW resumed efforts to organize farm workers after Cesar Chavez died in
1993, and in December 1994, the UFW won an election to represent the 1,400
workers employed by Bear Creek, better known as Jackson-Perkins, the rose
company.  On March 17, the UFW negotiated a three- year contract that increases
wages and benefits 22 percent over the life of the contract, sets a $5.82
hourly starting wage, and offers nine paid holidays, including Chavez's March
31 birthday.</tt><p>
<tt>On the eve of the ALRA's 20th anniversary of the ALRA, the state's
Legislative Analyst proposed eliminating the ALRB as an independent agency, and
combining it with the agency that regulates labor relations for public
employees.  The ALRB currently has only two of its authorized five members, and
in 1993-94 its 50 employees certified the results of nine elections and issued
31 Unfair labor Practice complaints.  The UFW protested the inclusion of the
ALRB into the PERB, arguing that it is currently in negotiations with 32 farms
that employ 13,000 farm workers.</tt><p>
<tt>California was battered by storms in January and March 1995--rainfall was
almost twice normal levels--and the rain washed away at least temporarily the
jobs of many immigrant farm workers, especially in Salinas-- the nation's
"Salad Bowl" about one hour south of San Francisco.  The Monterey County
agriculture commissioner, for example, estimated that instead of the usual
40,000 farm workers employed in March in the area, 30,000 acres of flooded
broccoli, cauliflower, and lettuce left only a few thousand employed.
Statewide, losses were estimated at $500 to $600 million, or 2 to 3 percent of
usual annual farm sales of $20 billion.</tt><p>
<tt>However, there should be about the same number of hours worked in
California agriculture in 1995, because farmers will replant vegetables such as
lettuce, and there will be significant clean up work in the state's orchards
and vineyards.  For example, only 600 of the state's 23,000 acres of
strawberries were washed away--less than 3 percent of the acreage.</tt><p>
<tt>There is some question about whether residents of small cities hard hit by
flooding -- Pajaro, Watsonville, and Castroville--will advise friends and
relatives in Mexico to stay there, especially in light of stepped up border
enforcement.  However, with workers in rural Mexico hearing of $5 to $6 hourly
wages in California, versus less than $1 per day in Mexico, many may
nonetheless be tempted to migrate.</tt><p>
<tt>There will be no water shortages to constrain planting in California
agriculture in 1995.  However, the demand for hired farm workers has been
increasing, as farmers shift from low-value and mechanically harvested crops
such to high-value fruits and vegetables that require more labor.</tt><p>
<tt>The Legal Services Corporation, which funds legal services for migrant farm
workers, is threatened once again with budget cuts.  The 1994-95 budget of $415
million for 320 organizations and 4000 lawyers has been slated for elimination
over 5 years, according to one plan of the House Republican leaders.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">German
Immigration and Integration Challenges</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The US and Germany are among the world's major countries of immigration.
The US takes in more immigrants than any other country, and Germany is the
chief destination of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe.  Nothing suggests
the influx of migrants to either country will soon cease.</tt><p>
<tt>Population growth in both countries is fueled by immigration.  In the US
about one-third of population growth is due to immigration; in Germany, 100
percent of the population growth is due to immigration.  About eight percent of
the 260 million US population are foreign-born, and almost nine percent of
Germany's 81 million residents are foreigners.  Some foreign-born residents in
the US are naturalized US citizens, and about one-sixth of Germany's foreigners
were born in Germany (persons born in the US are automatically US citizens;
persons born in Germany acquire the nationality of their parents).</tt><p>
<tt>Successive German governments have taken the position that "Germany is not
a country of immigration."  This is not to be understood as a descriptive
statement, but as a declaration of policy:  it means that Germany does not
invite settlement by foreigners.  The population of resident foreigners is
nonetheless growing, primarily as the result of a continuing influx of asylum
seekers, family unification, and births to foreigners living in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Can Germany and the US, despite differences in immigration history and
policy, learn from each other?  A March 28, 1995 conference in Washington DC on
immigration and asylum challenges and choices in Germany and the US, sponsored
by the UC Comparative Immigration and Integration Policy program, the American
Institute for Contemporary German Studies, and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung,
heard German experts review recent developments, and Americans draw comparisons
with recent US developments.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and the US offer an interesting comparison.  Germany proclaims that
it does not wish to become a country of immigration, but provides a relatively
generous set of services to legal foreigners.  The US, by contrast, basks in
its immigrant heritage, but provides relatively few public services to help to
integrate newcomers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Managing migration is a tough but not impossible challenge facing
industrial societies, and international comparisons will continue to be
fruitful.  As numbers rise and force action, leaders must be willing to
confront the trade-offs inherent in deciding how to manage immigration and
integration.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigration</u>.  The two parts of  Germany have been affected
differently by migration.  The former West Germany added 13 million net
immigrants between 1950 and 1993, while the former East Germany lost five
million residents because emigration exceeded immigration.  The former West
Germany included in 1993 about four in five Germans, and virtually all of the
seven million foreigners in Germany live in the former West Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is unlikely to remain a country in which foreigners arrive and
remain foreigners.  If a net 400,000 immigrants continued to arrive annually,
Germany would in 2030 have a population of about 90 million, of whom 30 percent
would be foreigners.  Major cities such as Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich,
which are now about one-quarter foreigners, would have populations that were
half or more foreign.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since one in six foreigners in Germany today was born in Germany--1.2
million of seven million--and half have lived in Germany for 10 or more years,
the status quo of foreigners remaining foreigners is not likely to continue.
</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  Most of the foreigners arriving in Germany over the past
five years seeking to settle have arrived as asylum seekers.  In Germany and
all of the industrial democracies, the majority of asylum applications are
rejected, so that separating genuine and false asylum applicants is a major
objective of all asylum systems.</tt><p>
<tt>When the number of asylum seekers surges, as it did in 1992 in Germany to
about 438,000, the cost of housing, feeding, and deciding asylum cases--some DM
6 to 8 billion or $4 to $5 billion--can equal contributions for development
assistance (Germany provided $7 billion ODA in 1993).</tt><p>
<tt>In 1992-93, there were numerous attacks on foreigners in Germany at a time
when over 1,000 foreigners daily were applying for asylum.  Germany added
resources to speed up the processing of asylum cases, to streamline the system
for determining whether a foreigner was being persecuted for political reasons
in his country of citizenship, and to return to neighboring "safe countries"
asylum seekers who passed through Poland and the Czech Republic en route to
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Most observers consider the asylum reform a success.  The number of asylum
applicants fell by three-fourths, reducing the state and local costs of housing
and feeding asylum applicants.  Romanians and Bulgarians learned that it was
not worthwhile attempting to get to Germany and apply for asylum.  There does
not appear to be an offsetting increase in illegal immigration from countries
that were sending asylum seekers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the early 1990s, the US too faced a huge backlog of asylum
applications--over 400,000 in 1995, representing over 700,000 individuals.  In
January 1995, the US streamlined its system and added more staff to speed up
asylum processing.  In the US today, an applicant applies to one of what will
soon be 327 asylum officers (Germany has 900), and that asylum officer either
grants asylum or refers the case to an immigration judge--a non-INS employee.
Second, asylum applicants must now wait at least 180 days to work legally in
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Both Germany and the US have invented in-between categories for aliens who
are not eligible for asylum, but who nonetheless are not deported.  The US and
German acronyms--TPS, DED, "tolerated"--reflect the expectation that these
aliens will eventually depart.</tt><p>
<tt>Mass asylum in industrial democracies is a 1980s-1990s phenomenon that has
been confronted with more staff to decide cases quickly, and by restricting
access to the system.  How is the asylum system likely to evolve?  Some believe
that the concept of safe haven will replace resettlement.  Under some notions,
ALL persons requesting asylum would be offered safe haven, perhaps on
extra-territorial islands.  Then, as budgets permit, individual cases would be
heard, and those deemed in need of resettlement would be granted the right to
begin life anew.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Foreign Workers.</u>  Germany recruited guest workers between 1961 and
1973, when their number peaked at 2.6 million, making one in eight workers a
foreigner.  Over the next 15 years, these foreign workers united their families
in Germany, and second and third generation-foreigners joined their parents in
the German work force.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigration in the 1990s</u>.  Germany responded to rising migration
pressures from the east after 1989 with five distinct foreign worker programs
that involve some 350,000 foreigners, and add the equivalent of about 150,000
full-time workers to the German work force.  However, unlike 1960s guest worker
programs, 1990s foreign worker programs have a different purpose--to cope with
micro rather than macro labor shortages, and to make inevitable migration
legal.  German foreign worker programs today also have different incentives for
the workers involved; the emphasis is on ensuring return to their countries of
origin.</tt><p>
<tt>The most important program involves project-tied workers.  Under this
program, German firms sub-contract with foreign firms, and the foreign firm
supplies the expertise and workers to complete a particular phase of a project.
There were an average 40,000 project-tied foreign workers in Germany in 1994,
down from 60,000 in 1992 because of scandals that involved German contractors
using project-tied agreements as backdoor guest worker programs.</tt><p>
<tt>Most newly-arrived foreign workers are employed seasonally in Germany.  A
peak 150,000 seasonal foreign workers in 1994 contributed the equivalent of
40,000 FTE to the German labor force.  Seasonal foreign workers can remain 90
days in Germany, and most are employed in agriculture, restaurants, or
construction.  If the workers are employed less than two months, the workers
and their employers do not have to pay social security taxes on their
wages.</tt><p>
<tt>The third program is for border commuters from the Czech Republic and
Poland.  If local workers are not available in Germany within 50 km of these
eastern borders, then employers can request permission from the German
Employment Service to employ commuter workers at prevailing wages who can
remain in Germany for up to two nights weekly.</tt><p>
<tt>The fourth program permits about 6,000 young East Europeans to work and
learn in Germany for up to 18 months, although evaluations indicate that
Czechs, Poles, and other East Europeans learn few skills in Germany that they
use at home.  Finally, about 1,000 nurses from the former Yugoslavia are
allowed to work in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>In both the US and Germany, there has been a shift in the rationale for
temporary foreign worker programs.  Instead of recruiting foreign workers to
deal with macro or widespread labor shortages, most programs today are
justified as a way to deal with a micro labor shortage, or to channel into
legal programs inevitable and otherwise illegal migrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, most of the industrial democracies have heeded the advice of the
OECD and deregulated their labor markets, and most today play less of a
job-matching role in labor markets.  The German ES matches about 35 percent of
all job seekers and jobs, the US ES three to four percent--giving governments
less credibility when considering employer requests for foreign workers.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">Muslim
Immigrants in
France</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>There are three to five million Muslims in France, including one million
who are French citizens.  There have been Muslims in France since the beginning
of the 20th century, but it was only in 1967 that their number topped one
million.</tt><p>
<tt>France on January 1, 1994 had 58 million residents.  The French population
has been increasing by about 400,000 annually, due to 300,000 more births than
deaths, and 100,000 immigrants.  Half of all French immigrants, and 40 percent
of the asylum seekers, are from Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>In the past, France had an assimilationist attitude toward
immigration--immigrants were expected to learn French and to conform to French
values in public.  Muslims have begun to challenge assimilation just as France,
like other industrial countries, is debating the best way to integrate minority
immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Fall 1994, the French government officially banned girls who wear
"ostentatious" headscarves from attending public schools.  Some Islamic
associations immediately attacked the headscarf ban as a symbol of French
intolerance for minorities; 22 percent of the Muslims polled in October 1994
thought that Muslim girls should be allowed to wear headscarves to school.
One-third of the Muslims polled agreed that integration into French society
means that an individual becomes less Muslim.</tt><p>
<tt>Muslim girls in France face special challenges.  At home, boys are favored,
but in school, Muslim girls reportedly do better than Muslim boys because they
are treated more equally than at home.  Many Muslim families reportedly arrange
marriages for their daughters at age 18 and, if the girl objects, she sometimes
must make a break from her family.  Other girls go to the other extreme,
becoming fundamentalist to gain power within their families.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 21, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights issued
its annual report on human rights in France.  The report expressed alarm over
the continued spread of intolerance toward foreigners, especially toward those
of North African origin.  The Commission reiterated its criticisms of a series
of laws passed in 1993 tightening controls on immigration and restricting
access to the French nationality.</tt><p>
<tt>One of the laws passed in 1993 tightened the regulations on marriages
between immigrants and French citizens.  Immigrants married for more than one
year to a French citizen, or who are parents of a child born in France,
generally cannot be deported.  Previously, the government granted long-term
residence cards to such immigrants.  Under the 1993 law, the government rarely
grants work, study or residence permits.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The two-year-old law, according to a government spokesperson, was
designed to stop marriages of convenience.  Mayors have the power to review
marriage applications and refuse those they think are for convenience.  An
organization called Lune de Miel says that the law has left many partners in
honest marriages between an immigrant and French citizen without access to
social services and employment. </tt><p>
<tt>French authorities are continuing to stop dark-skinned men to check their
documentation.  The random checks began in fall 1994 after five French citizens
were slain in Algeria.  French authorities worry that the violence plaguing
Algeria will move to France.  After the hijacking of an Air France plane from
Algiers, French citizens backed the crackdown. </tt><p>
<tt>"The zero generation" is a term coined to describe the French born-children
of immigrants parents, who have no opportunities due to a stagnant French
economy.  They are frequently turning to fundamentalism.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Algeria, a civil war between Islamic fundamentalists and the military
government threatened to add to the 800,000 Algerians and three million French
citizens of Algerian origin in France.  </tt><p>
<tt>Algeria, which  has 28 million people and a per capita GDP of $1800, won
its independence from France in 1962.   A new 1989 constitution permitted
political parties to contest elections but, when it appeared that
fundamentalists would win the<b> </b>general election, the government annulled
the election, with the support of the French government.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since then, there has been fighting between Islamic militants and
government troops, and 300 to 600 militants headed to Algiers were reportedly
killed by government troops in an ambush near the end of March.</tt><p>

<tt>The immigration bill being prepared by Home Secretary Michael Howard
responds to critics who assert that current controls fail to combat illegal
immigration and that European integration will worsen the problem of "backdoor"
immigration.  If enacted, Britain would introduce sanctions on employers of
illegal immigrants, removing the right to oral hearings for those asylum
seekers whose claims are without foundation, increasing the countries to which
visa restrictions apply, and publishing a list of safe third countries to which
rejected asylum seekers could be sent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Additionally, a reduction in benefits payable to asylum seekers is part of
the proposed reform to combat illegal immigration.  Last year, 50,000 asylum
seekers waiting for their applications to be processed received Social Security
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The impetus for the proposed benefits reductions stems from the growth in
the backlog of applications awaiting decision, from 5,060 in 1985 to 55,000
last year.  Allegations that 80 percent of the asylum applications are bogus
further fuels the drive for reform.  Proponents argue that cutting benefits
will send an important message to bogus asylum claimants.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the proposal to fine employers of illegal immigrants, employers would
have to check national insurance numbers - or social security ID cards - before
employing someone.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Department of Employment reports that 864,000 foreigners were
employed legally in Britain in  spring 1994, and they were three percent of the
overall labor force.  Of the two million foreigners in the country, 44 percent
were employed.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in Britain are grouped at the ends of the skill
spectrum--they tend to be more or less skilled the labor force as a whole.  The
professionals, managers, and technical workers are often in Britain because of
corporate transfers.</tt><p>
<tt>The lower skilled foreigners are more likely than Britons to work in
labor-intensive industries, such as hotels, restaurants, distribution and
repairs.  The Irish Republic has been a traditional source of immigrant
labor--over 200,000 Irish workers are employed in Britain, as well as 15,000
Germans. </tt><p>
<tt>Britain is the only country that conducts DNA tests to see if a child being
brought into the country for family reunification is indeed the claimant's
child.  The tests are most frequently used for those coming from South Asia and
Africa.  Applicants have the right to refuse the test. </tt><p>
<tt>Last year the British High Commission in Islamabad carried out 833 genetic
tests on Pakistanis trying to send children and other relatives to Britain.  In
an effort to keep track of the complicated strands of Muslim family life, where
one man may have several wives, British embassy officials in maintain about
280,000 files on Pakistani families with British ties going back to the 1950s.
Each applicant is asked to draw up a family tree, which is in
computerized.</tt><p>

<tt>On March 26, 1995, the seven Schengen countries of Germany, France, Spain,
Portugal and the three Benelux countries abolished border controls between
themselves.  These countries have established the Schengen Information System
in Strasbourg, simplified extradition arrangements, and agreed on a list of
countries from which visas will be required to enter any Schengen member
country.  Britain threatened to veto any attempt to mandate the extension of
the Schengen agreement to all EU states.</tt><p>
<tt>The traveling public noticed little change because most of the land borders
shared by the seven countries had been reduced or eliminated since customs
checks ended on January 1, 1993 with the launching of the single European
market. The main impact of the Schengen changes will be felt at airports, which
will make a distinction between passengers arriving from within the Schengen
area and those flying in from outside.  Hence, flights between Munich and Paris
will be able treated domestic trips, and passengers will be able to travel
without their passports.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 26, 1995, 30 Ghanaians who were being deported walked unchallenged
through the barriers at Amsterdam's Schipol airport.  Another 80 were stopped
by immigration officials.  The Ghanaians were given "smart cards, "on a flight
from Brussels to Amsterdam, where they were to catch a connecting flight to
Africa.  The Belgian police thought the Ghanaians would be held in the transit
area, as happened in the past.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be 3.5 to 5.5 million illegal aliens among the EU's
372 million residents, meaning that 1 to 1.5 percent of the EU population are
unauthorized foreigners.  The French in October 1994 established a 6,200 member
police force to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany tightened border security along the eastern frontier to prevent
illegal immigration. But, the feared hordes of Poles flooding Germany failed to
materialize.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany launched a crackdown--putting up traffic checkpoints--on its
western frontier with France, Belgium, and the Netherlands on January 1, 1995
that resulted in the apprehension of 900 illegal aliens in two months.  Many
were Albanians who had paid $1,300 to $2,000 to be taken by ferry to Italy,
then to France, and finally to Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>A report noting that despite EU promotion of the four freedoms--the freedom
of movement of goods, capital, services, and labor-- less than two percent of
the EU nationals live in another EU nation, prompted one reporter to assert
that abolishing US border controls would solve the immigration control problem
and "would produce no new tidal wave of the poor into Texas, Arizona and
California."  </tt><p>
<tt>The major basis of this conclusion is that most people do not move.
According to some Europeans, ''The real [immigration] controls are complicated
things like cultural traditions and language, not the physical barriers between
countries.'' </tt><p>
<tt>From 1987 to 1991, approximately 1.5 million people moved from one
member-state to another.  Much of the movement has been the north-south
movement of retirees--for example, 29,000 Spaniards have moved to the UK, while
86,000 Britons have moved to Spain.  With a projected 75 million retirees by
the year 2000, some predict more north to south migration.  </tt><p>
<tt>Denmark was the wealthiest EU nation in 1991--its per capita GDP of $23,660
was four times Portugal's $5,620. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Relations between Greece and Albania soured again at the end of March after
a report that Greek border guards shot and killed an Albanian man who had
crossed into Greece illegally and ignored warning shots while returning.  The
Greek government denied that the shooting occurred. </tt><p>
<tt>There had been hope that relations between the two countries were improving
after Greece's foreign minister visited Albania.  The mid-March visit was
designed to repair relations after Greece expelled 70,000 Albanians in 1994 in
retaliation for Albania sentencing several ethnic Greeks to death for spying.
There are about 400,000 ethnic Greeks among Albania's three million people.
</tt><p>
<tt>Greece and Albania agreed to establish a program under which Albanians can
work seasonally in Greece.  They also agreed to consider opening a Greek bank
branch in Tirana to facilitate the transfer of remittances from Albanian
workers in Greece.</tt><p>
<tt>Albania is the poorest country in Europe.  According to the government,
unemployment is 30 percent, although some Albanians claim it is 80 percent.
There is running water only three times per day and the electricity supply is
sporadic.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to a poll by a Tirana professor, 82 percent of Albanians would
leave the country if they could, and only Germany has agreed to accept a few
hundred Albanian emigrants.  Malaysia is the only country to allow Albanians to
enter without a visa.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 26, police dispersed 1,200 youth in Tirana who had assembled
outside the US Embassy after a newspaper falsely reported that the US was
offering work visas.  A similar incident occurred three days earlier.</tt><p>
<tt>On the streets of the Albanian capital of Tirana, counterfeit passports
sell for about $US 5,000.  A visa to Italy is about $US 1,500.  Families
purchase the documents with their life savings --the average income in Albania
is less than $US 400 per year.  If they cannot afford false documents,
Albanians go to Vlora to catch a $US 500 to $US 1,000 three-hour boat ride to
Italy, where taxis wait to take them to the train station. </tt><p>
<tt>Italian border police report that 11,000 ethnic Albanians from the Kosovo
province in Serbia have vanished after arriving legally in the country.  Border
police speculate that they moved on to France and Germany.  Citizens of former

<a name="RTFToC15">Turkey
and Germany Struggle with Racial Tensions</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In Turkey, there are fears that fundamentalist-government tension, plus an
internal struggle over Kurdish separatism, could lead to mass
emigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey is a country of 60 million that has been knocking on Europe's door
since 1987, when Turkey formally applied to join the EU.  Turkey's application
was rebuffed in 1989, but on March 6, 1995, Turkey and the EU signed a customs
union that will free up trade beginning in 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the agreement is approved by the EU Parliament, Turkey would receive
about $900 million in aid over several years.  However, members of the EU
Parliament have threatened to withhold approval of the agreement because of
Turkey's treatment of its Kurdish minority.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also fears that fundamentalists could come to power in Turkey, or
that a fundamentalist-secular split could plunge the country into civil war.
The conflicts within Turkey are already mirrored in disputes among the two
million Turks in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about two million Turks in Germany, including about 400,000
Kurds, 400,000 to 600,000 Alawites, and 1 million ethnic Turks.  Germany
estimates that about 35,000 of the Turks in the country are fundamentalists,
extremists, or PKK militants.   </tt><p>
<tt>Germany has several times suspended the deportation of Kurds because of
Turkey's alleged violations of Kurdish human rights, but at the same time, the
German government has sold weapons to the Turkish government.  On March 20,
Turkey sent 35,000 troops across the Iraqi border in an effort to wipe out
Kurdish bases there.</tt><p>
<tt>In March there was a wave of firebombings of Turkish mosques, travel
agencies and cultural centers.  Unlike previous violence of Germans attacking
foreigners, these firebombings are the result of the divisions between Turks.
German authorities believe that most of the attacks are led by the separatist
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK).  Some Turks believe that there is tacit German
solidarity with the Kurds, and that the German authorities were not doing
enough to protect Turks from Kurds in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In Germany, the attacks on Turks are reportedly convincing more Germans
that the Turks will not be easily integrated into German society.   On March
15, the German government decided to resume the deportation of illegal Kurdish
immigrants and rejected asylum seekers, after a Parliamentary committee heard
17 witnesses testify that Turkey generally does protect the rights of Kurds and
all other Turkish residents.  Even though 11 of Germany's 16 foreigners'
commissioners asked that the moratorium on deportations be extended, the
Foreign Ministry and the Turkish government argued that even Turks accused of
criminal conduct in Turkey who are returned have their legal rights
protected.</tt><p>
<tt>Deportations are the responsibility of the state governments, and the 11
SPD-ruled states announced that they would continue to not to expel
Kurds.</tt><p>
<tt>Violence against Turks appears to be moving to Switzerland following
firebombings aimed at several Turkish travel agencies in several northern Swiss
towns.  In Basle, Kurdish protesters fought with police after a Kurdish
cultural center was closed.  In Zurich, Turkish Moslem Alawites and Turkish and
Kurdish communists staged separate demonstrations to protest police violence in
Istanbul and Ankara, and the Turkish army's drive against Kurdish separatists.
Similar marches were held in German, Austrian and French cities on March 18.

<a name="RTFToC17">Philippines
to Restrict Overseas
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Philippines has instituted rules to limit the numbers of workers
overseas because of mistreatment of Filipino workers abroad.  The Philippines
is among the world's top labor exporting countries, with an estimated 2 to 3.5
million Filipinos working in some 140 nations as construction workers,
domestic helpers, entertainers, crew members on ships, hotel employees,
teachers and office clerks.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Filipino overseas workers sent home some $2.4 billion through
formal channels, up from 1993 remittances of $2.2 billion.  The economic impact
of these remittances in the Philippines is believed to be over $8 billion
annually, or one-sixth of the Philippines $52 billion GDP.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 17, 1995, Singapore hanged a 42 year-old Filipina maid for killing
in 1991 another maid and a child.  Her case became a cause celebre in the
Philippines after two other Filipinos argued that she was framed.  </tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Ramos asked that the execution be postponed and, when
it was not, the Singaporean Prime Minister was forced to postpone a scheduled
trip to Manila.  There are about 75,000 Filipinos working in Singapore, most as
maids, and on March 26, 1995, there were massive demonstrations throughout the
Philippines to protest harsh treatment of Filipinos in Singapore.  As public
resentment swelled, President Ramos recalled the Philippine ambassador and
banned Filipinas from going to work in Singapore.  </tt><p>
<tt>The maid's March 26, 1995 funeral march turned into a massive demonstration
against Singapore for executing the maid, and against the Filipino government
for failing to protect Filipino workers abroad.  Some reports compared the
emotional outpouring for the executed maid to the 1986 revolt that led to the
end of the Marcos government.</tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Ramos ordered the evacuation of Filipina maids who
wanted to leave Singapore and sent military aircraft on March 29 to fly home 83
Filipina maids.  Most of the maids who signed up for the flight home claimed
they were mistreated by their Singaporean employers or were homesick.  Several
days later, Ramos extended the invitation to return home at government expense
to overseas workers in other countries. </tt><p>
<tt>The hanging of the Filipina maid in Singapore has reopened a debate over
how to protect Filipino migrant workers abroad.  Every year, reportedly
"hundreds" of Filipino migrant workers return in coffins, usually as a result
of workplace accidents, but also for violating other countries' laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The Middle East and Singapore are among the places most frequently cited as
abusing Filipino workers.  The Philippines has been pushing for a
U.N.-sponsored global conference on labor migration.  The Philippines sponsored
a resolution in the United Nations seeking more protections for migrant
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most Asian labor-importing nations object to more migrant worker
protections.</tt><p>
<tt>A high level Thai official called for an agreement on the free movement of
labor after the hanging of the Filipina maid.  Such an agreement would give
ASEAN member countries a framework upon which to base uniform rules for the
protection of workers' rights.  The issue is expected to be raised at an
informal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers in April 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the Philippine government required Singaporean recruitment
agencies to post a $4,000 bond for every 50 domestic helpers they recruited in
the Philippines.  Manila says the bond will be put in escrow and used to help
maids who have been abused in Singapore. </tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Labor and Employment has also started an accreditation
scheme for foreign employers.  DOLE reports that domestic helpers in Japan can
earn $ 1,200 a month compared to $200 monthly in Saudi Arabia.</tt><p>
<tt>Following pressure after the hanging of the Filipina maid in Singapore,
President Ramos appealed for clemency for a Filipino worker sentenced to die
for murder in the United Arab Emirates.  The Philippine leader has also ordered
full legal assistance to another Filipina domestic being tried in the UAE for
murdering her employer, who had allegedly raped her.</tt><p>
<tt>Filipina maids in Hong Kong are worried that as the colony prepares to be

have given no official response to the question of whether Filipina maids will
be able to be employed in Hong Kong after 1997.  There are about 100,000
Filipina maids in Hong Kong, earning an $US 485 per month.  The average per
capita income in the Philippines was $770 yearly in 1992.</tt><p>

<tt>The Korean government has launched a program to 'internationalize' Korea's
insular and homogeneous society.  However, its attempts to use foreign trainees
to curb labor shortages in Korea and provide the training needed to accelerate
development in labor-surplus countries got off to a rough start.  </tt><p>
<tt>In January 1995, Nepalese factory trainees held a nine-day sit-in at
Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral, complaining that the trainee program begun in
1993, and administered by the Korea Federation of Small Business, was really a
slave labor program.  In January 1995, trainees were 19,000 of the 33,600
foreigners legally working in Korea.  Most were from China, the Philippines,
and India and Pakistan.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey by of 185 workers at an industrial complex in Seoul indicate that
42 percent were beaten.  </tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in 1996, Korea plans to admit legal foreign workers--not
trainees--who will have contracts and be guaranteed the same wages as Korean
workers.  Korea hopes to control illegal alien workers, who number about
50,000, by<b> </b>1999.  The government will increase the number of foreign
industrial and trainee-workers to fill the gap in the industrial work force
that results from the deportation of illegal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The policy is based on the belief that the only way to fundamentally
resolve the controversial issue of illegal foreign workers would be to
eliminate foreign workers who overstay their visits and to improve the foreign
trainee system.  However, small industries depend heavily on illegal foreign
workers who overstay their visits, and the labor ministry plans to reduce their
number by deporting about 10,000 a year through 1999.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration data indicate that overstaying foreign workers totaled 49,800
as of the end of January, 1995.  They include 19,800 Korean-Chinese, 7,500
Filipinos, 5,000 Bangladeshis, 2,300 Pakistanis and 2,000 Nepalese.  A total of
4,422 illegal foreign workers were deported in 1994, 894 of them forcibly and
3,528 voluntarily after they received exit orders.</tt><p>
<tt>Two Korean government agencies disagree on the employment and management of
foreign workers.  The Ministry of Labor is trying pass special laws to employ
and manage foreign workers, but the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is
opposed to any law, saying it will impose a burden on smaller companies.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Labor ministry has announced that, despite protests, it will introduce
a minimum wage system for foreign trainees in Korea.  However, a minimum wage
might encourage some employers to reduce their outlays for lodging and boarding
of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The technical trainees earn about US$20 per month.  Many prefer to work
illegally, since they can earn US$450 per month. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>A profile of Asian professionals in the US who are returning to Taiwan,
Korea, India, and other Asian countries of citizenship suggests that a
combination of economic growth that has narrowed income gaps, new private
investment in high-tech industries, and government policies that subsidize
returns has persuaded thousands of engineers and financial professionals to
return to their countries of origin.  Emigration from the US is estimated to be
about 200,000 of the estimated 850,000 immigrants arriving  annually in the
early 1990s, suggesting that emigration is about 25 percent of
immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>An OCAC survey on ROC nationals who have migrated to the United States
shows that 27 percent have done so for business reasons, 21 percent have gone
for the sake of their children's education, and another 10 percent said they
migrated to continue their own advanced studies.  Only 14 percent said they
emigrated due to the low quality of life in Taiwan, and 9 percent said they
chose to emigrate because of the poor social security situation in Taiwan.
</tt><p>
<tt>Another 8 percent said their motive for emigrating was their fear of a
communist Chinese invasion, 7 percent said they were wary of the unstable
political situation, and 5 percent said they wanted to live with other family
members in the United States.  </tt><p>
<tt>The report says that the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and
South Africa are the top five countries of destination for Taiwanese emigrants.
Data from the five countries show that 21,166 ROC citizens emigrated to those
countries in 1990; 19,988 in 1991; 21,580 in 1992, and 22,081 in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>The emigration rates of Taiwanese to the five countries are related to
those countries' immigration policies.  Stricter immigration policies adopted
by the US, Canada, and Australia are expected to slow the number of immigrants
from Taiwan, while the relatively more relaxed immigration rules of New Zealand
will prompt more Taiwan people to seek residency there. In addition, the
Interior Ministry is planning to establish an emigration agency.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the returning Asian professionals studied in the US, and were
offered jobs upon graduation by US employers.  With prospects for using their
training at home in modern labs dim, many stayed in the US.  In the 1990s,
however, US aerospace, financial, and other industries sharply reduced
employment, while such industries boomed in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Asians are returning in what Taiwan calls rencai huiliu--return
flow of human talent--accept pay cuts of 30 to 40 percent in exchange for being
closer to aging parents and relatives and what they see as better prospects for
upward mobility.</tt><p>
<tt>In a bid to attract more professionals and investment capital from Hong
Kong and Macao, Taiwan has relaxed its immigration rules.  Investment
requirements have been lowered from $US 384,000 to $US 192,307; investors must
remain in Taiwan for 21 out of 24 months.  The new rules must be approved by
the Cabinet. </tt><p>

<tt>More than 800,000 Vietnamese have been housed at least temporarily in camps
in southeast Asian camps since 1975, and 46,000 remain there.  Half are in Hong
Kong and the rest are scattered throughout Southeast Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>As countries such as the Philippines begin to force the remaining
Vietnamese to return home, scenes such as that near Manila--where Filipino
police had to prevent Vietnamese from committing suicide as they were being
moved to an island in preparation for their return to Vietnam--are likely to
become more common. British officials are skeptical that Vietnam can meet the
timetable to prepare for the return in 12 months of the 22,000 boat people in
Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Vietnamese in the Filipino camps left Vietnam in boats in the
past eight years to take advantage of a US program that offered US citizenship
to Amerasian children of American soldiers.  The Vietnamese were in a program
allowing them to emigrate to the US after cultural training and English at the
camp.  </tt><p>
<tt>US officials concluded that virtually all of the documentation of the
remaining Vietnamese in the Philippines is false, so they were denied entry
into the US.  The UN closed the camp in which they live on December 31,
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The US has offered to pay repatriation costs for the 272 boat people but
has encountered difficulties negotiating with the Vietnamese government.  The
UNHCR has requested that countries donate $74 million for the repatriation of
the Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>A World Bank report says that 51 percent of the Vietnamese population lives
in poverty.  The Vietnamese economy is growing at eight percent per year, and
the World Bank estimates that poverty will have fallen by 29 percent by
2000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Vietnamese community in Australia had begun a campaign to persuade the
Australian government to assist boat people in overseas refugee camps. The
campaign has been sparked by fears in the international Vietnamese community
that genuine refugees will be forcibly returned to Vietnam and face persecution
or death.</tt><p>

<tt>The 20,000 delegates from 120 nations gathered in Copenhagen spent $30 to
$60 million to discuss ways to reduce the poverty that afflicts 1.3 billion
people--almost 1 in 4 persons worldwide lives on less than $1 per day.
Underlying the discussion of ways to alleviate suffering was, for some
countries, fears of uncontrolled migration and environmental degradation.
</tt><p>
<tt>Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark laid out a "very concrete" argument to
use with "ordinary people" to justify aid to emigration countries:  "if you
don't help the Third World...then you will have these poor people in our
society."  Since "Europe has now lived through a period where thousands and
thousands and thousands of refugees are coming from various parts of the
world...ordinary people now recognize ...the global situation."</tt><p>
<tt>The challenge is daunting.  About 20 percent of the world's population is
very poor, 70 percent of the poor are women, and poor nations owe $1.4 trillion
in debt.  Industrial nations urged poor nations to follow market-oriented
economic polices and to extirpate corruption and guarantee basic human rights.
Poor countries countered that their debts should be canceled, and that aid
should come without strings.</tt><p>
<tt>The Group of 77--130 developing nations--asked industrial country donors to
adopt a 20-20 formula--20 percent of their aid would be earmarked for basic
human needs such as schools and hospitals, and recipient countries would also
commit 20 percent of their government expenditures to basic human needs.  If
implemented, industrial countries would have to triple their spending on basic
human needs, and poor countries double their spending.</tt><p>
<tt>According to economists, the gap between the richest 20 percent and the
poorest 20 percent of the world's population has doubled since the 1960s.  Many
of the 1,050 citizen groups that ran a parallel conference criticized the UN
parley as filled with rhetoric but few concrete plans.</tt><p>

Rounds Up Colombian Illegal

</a></h2>
<tt>Venezuelan soldiers rounded up abut 1,000 illegal Colombian immigrants in a
border area, burned their homes and crops, and deported them to Colombia.  The
expulsions were a reprisal for a raid by Colombian guerrillas that killed eight
Venezuelan marines.</tt><p>
<tt>The Colombian government demanded that Venezuela compensate the Colombian
farmers who were deported.  The Venezuelan government rejected the demands and
reinforced the border area.  The government said it plans to deport another
2,500 Colombians in the near future. </tt><p>
<tt>Colombia and Venezuela share a 1,378 mile border that has been the frequent
site of border skirmishes between the two countries.  An estimated 1.5 million
undocumented Colombian immigrants are in Venezuela.  Colombian guerrillas have
attacked Venezuelan military installations about 50 times, killing 30
Venezuelan soldiers.  During the last half of 1994, about 3,600 cars stolen
from Venezuelans were taken to Colombia.  Virtually all of the three tons of
cocaine confiscated in Venezuela last year came from  Colombia.</tt><p>
<tt>Venezuela is now demanding the right of "hot pursuit" to chase Colombian
guerrillas across the border.  A Colombian public opinion poll conducted the
week of March 5 found that 96 percent of the respondents oppose allowing
Venezuelan soldiers to enter Colombia. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (no 2) 1995, if approved, will
prevent Chinese boat people from applying for refugee status on the grounds
that China is a safe "third country."  An additional amendment to prevent
Chinese boat people from claiming refugee status in Australia on the grounds of
their country's one-child policy is expected to be included in the package.
</tt><p>
<tt>The proposed law has sparked bitter criticism from Australia's Asian
communities, human rights groups, and the Catholic Church, and prompted the
country's longest-serving politician to threaten to resign if it is
passed.</tt><p>
<tt>The bill was introduced by Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus to counter the
threatened flood of boat people.  He explained that the bill was needed to
"ensure that unauthorized arrivals are not able to abuse the system." </tt><p>
<tt>These reforms come three years after Minister Gerry Hand introduced the
Migration Reform Act of 1992.  The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
annual report for 1993-94 found that its refugee decision-making process was
working effectively. </tt><p>
<tt>The opposition indicated that it will support the amended bill if it
ensured that people who had "direct" fears of persecution under the one-child
policy would be allowed to apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Targeting the Sino-Vietnamese as potential abusers of the refugee system is
surprising, considering their unusually high recognition as refugees.  UNHCR
commented that such restrictive measures may prevent genuine refugees from
access to asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Following the arrival of 106 asylum seekers from China, the Australian
government is bracing for another possible influx if illegal boat people.  The
Australian facilities are currently full and any more arrivals will be housed
at a air force base in the western part of the country. </tt><p>
<tt>Australia has signed a memorandum of understanding with China under which
the Australian government has agreed to pay for the transport of boat people
back to China -- if they do not succeed in their attempts to gain asylum -- and
some of their repatriation costs.  Under one proposal, asylum would be refused
if an applicant already had the protection of another country.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-March, Australia announced that foreigners who deposit $550,000 in
government securities for at least three years can become legal immigrants.
About 2,100 of the 76,000 slots available to immigrants in 1995 have been
reserved for such investors, and 15,000 immigrants have come to Australia under
such investor programs since 1981.</tt><p>

against immigration, based on Brimelow's assertion that shared cultural norms
are what undergird capitalism and stable societies.  Brimelow argues that much
more should  be done to reduce illegal immigration, and that reducing illegal
immigration can be justified in the name of avoiding a change in the nation's
racial-ethnic composition.</tt><p>
