<b>Use Herbs and Nutrients to Reverse Prostate Problems</b><br>

	Problems with the prostate are by no means inevitable for men over 50, yet statistics show that taking care of your prostate before serious problems develop is a good idea. Prostate problems account for an estimated 5.5 million doctor visits, 950,000 hospitalizations, 43,500 deaths, and about $7 billion in medical bills every year, states Michael B. Schachter, M.D., a physician practicing in Suffern, New York.<p>
	According to Dr. Schachter, there are a number of dietary and nutritional steps any man can take today to either prevent or treat a swollen prostate (called benign prostatic hyperplasia) or an inflamed prostate (called prostatitis).<p>
	General Diet. A diet high in fiber, high in complex carbohydrates, low in fat, and moderate in protein is advisable.<p>
	Substances to Avoid. Avoid sugar, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, white flour products, hydrogenated fats, food additives and chemicals, fluoride, chlorine, aluminum and Teflon cookware, nonprescription recreational drugs, mercury amalgam fillings, electric blankets, and hair dyes.<p>
	Zinc Picolinate. Take 15-60 mg daily. As the prostate contains 10 times more zinc than any other body organ, this is the single most important prostate nutrient, states Dr. Schachter.<p>
	Vitamin B6. Also called pyridoxine, B6 enhances the absorption of zinc; take 50-300 mg daily.<p>
	Magnesium. Take 200-600 mg daily of elemental magnesium in glycinate or taurate form. Magnesium aids muscle function and boosts the immune system as it deals with infections.<p>
	Saw Palmetto. Taken at the rate of 2 capsules, 80 mg each, 2 times daily, saw palmetto berry is effective in treating many male urogenital conditions without suppressing sexual interest.<p>
	Pygeum Africanum. This substance, derived from an African evergreen tree, taken at the dosage of 25-50 mg daily (in a 200:1 concentrate), contains substances that act against inflammations and bacteria. It has been used in Europe to treat prostate problems since the early 1980s.<p>
	Stinging Nettle. Used in combination with Pygeum, at the rate of 150-300 mg daily (at a 5:1 concentration), stinging nettle leaves enhance its effects, strengthening urinary flow.<p>
	Cernilton Flower Pollen. This substance (6-12 capsules at 500 mg each daily) removes obstructions to urine flow; bee pollen works well, too.<p>
	Flaxseed Oil. This oil contains alpha linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid necessary for making hormones that work against inflammation and cancer. Take 1-2 tablespoons or 12 capsules daily.<p>
	Evening Primrose Oil. This contains gamma linolenic acid, an omega-6 essential fatty acid, with the same action as flaxseed oil. Take 6-12 capsules at 500 mg each daily.<p>
	Vitamin E. Take 1 capsule (400 I.U.) 2 times daily.<p>
	Other. Dr. Schachter recommends taking sodium selenite (elemental selenium) at the rate of 200-400 mcg daily; copper sebacate (elemental copper) at 4 mg daily; amino acids (glycine, alanine, glutamic acid) 6 capsules daily; and a multivitamin/ mineral pill.<p>

<a name="stop"><h4>Your Hands Can Stop a Heart Attack.</h4></a>

<b>And Energize Your Body</b><br>

	There are particular locations on your body, called Energy Sphere Points, which you can lightly touch  with your fingertips, to stop a heart attack, seizure, or asthma attack, or to revitalize your whole body with energy, says Glenn King, director of the Glenn King Institute for Better Health in Dallas, Texas.<p>
	King is the foremost U.S. practitioner of a little known Japanese art called Ki-Iki-Jutsu (pronounced key-ee-key-joot-soo), which means, literally, “breath-of-life art.” In practical terms, it’s a finger-delivered form of therapy that “allows the body by its own tremendous power to heal itself by unconstricting any stagnation or blockage of the natural energy circulatory patterns,” King explains. 	Subtle body energy (known in Chinese medicine as Qi, presented by King as Ki, pronounced chee) flows along regular pathways throughout the body. Press gently on the right points and you can treat seizures, chronic pain, insomnia, depression, migraines, memory loss, lymph disorders, and other more serious health conditions.<p>
	Heart Attack. A partner is required to perform this. Place your right fingertips (fingerpads) on the heart attack victim’s  5th thoracic vertebra  (the 12th vertebra down from the top of the neck; see illustration) while your left hand holds the little finger of the patient’s left hand. “This prompt action has consistently stopped heart attacks in progress,” states King. It can shift a person from being on the verge of entering cardiac arrest into a state of no sign of heart arrhythmia, pain, or discoloration within 2 minutes, on average, King says, adding that these results have been confirmed by cardiologists. William Lee Cowden, M.D., for one,  has used Ki-Iki-Jutsu successfully on 12 patients.<p>
	Seizures. Firmly hold both big toes of the person or firmly grasp both thumbs to stop the seizure.<p>
	Asthma Attack. Place the fingertips of your right hand on the patient’s 3rd thoracic vertebra (10th vertebrae down from the top of the neck; see illustration). With your left hand, hold the middle finger of the patient’s left hand for 3-4 minutes, then hold the middle finger of the patient’s right hand for 3-4 minutes, then the left again, until the attack subsides.<p>
	Anaphylactic Shock. Place one hand on the patient’s first thoracic vertebra (the 8th vertebra down from the top of the neck; see illustration) while placing the other on top edge of the sternum, just below the trachea, until the symptoms subside.<p>
	Whole-Body Energizing. “Use this simple technique to revitalize the circulation of energy throughout your body, relax tension, promote mental alertness, and improve sleep,” King advises. The sequence of 8 steps should take about 24 minutes. Use the fingertips of your index, middle, and ring fingers. Only light finger contact, not pressure, is required. Lie down on a comfortable surface.<p>

<ul>

<li>Step 1: Place your right hand fingertips on the top center of your head; place your left hand fingertips between the eyebrows. Hold for 3 minutes. Keep your right hand fingertips in this location until you reach step 8:
<li>Step 2: Place your left hand fingertips at the tip of your nose; hold for 3 minutes.
<li>Step 3: Place your left hand fingertips at the center of the top edge of the sternum; hold for 3 minutes.
<li>Step 4: Place your left hand fingertips at the center of your sternum; hold for 3 minutes.
<li>Step 5: Place your left hand fingertips at the bottom end of your sternum; hold for 3 minutes.
<li>Step 6: Place your left hand fingertips at your navel; hold for 3 minutes.
<li>Step 7: Place your left hand fingertips at the top center of your pubic bone; hold for 3 minutes.
<li>Step 8: Place your right hand fingertips at the tip of your tailbone or coccyx; keep the left hand fingertips on the top center of your pubic bone  for 3 minutes.

<a name="get"><h4>Nutritional Relief for Arthritis</h4></a>

	Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly prescribed for arthritis, they can produce irritation and inflammation, even ulcers, in the gastrointestinal tract. There are effective nutritional alternatives for treating arthritis, says Seattle, Washington, physician Ralph Golan, M.D.<p>
	<b>Medications</b>. If you must stay on conventional arthritis medications, take licorice root extract (deglycyrrhizinated, up to 1000 mg daily) to protect your intestinal mucosa.<p>
	<b>Diet</b>. Eat whole foods to minimize your consumption of free radicals and trans-fatty acids. Eat liberal amounts of cherries and bilberries; stay away from the nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, tobacco) for 3 months.<p>
	<b>Detoxify</b>. Do a bowel cleansing followed by a liver flush; do a one-day fast;  brush your skin every day with a hairbrush.<p>
	<b>Vitamins</b>. Take beta carotene (15,000-25,000 I.U. daily); vitamin E (400-800 I.U. daily); vitamin C (2000-3000 mg daily); vitamin B6 (50-100 mg daily).<p>
	<b>Minerals</b>. Take zinc (30 mg daily); selenium (200 mcg daily); copper (2-3 mg daily); manganese (up to 100 mg daily for 6-12 months, then reduce to 20 mg daily).<p>
	<b>Supplements</b>. These include methionine (250 mg daily, in 3 doses); glucosamine sulfate (500-1000 mg, 3 times daily); shark cartilage capsules (up to 2200 mg, 3 times daily); EPA fish oil (up to 1000 mg, 3 times daily) with borage oil capsules (2-3 times daily, for a total of 500 mg daily of gamma linolenic acid); niacinamide (up to 1000 mg, 3 times daily); high doses can temporarily irritate the liver, so check with your doctor).<p>
	<b>Herbs</b>. Recommended here are hawthorn berry (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of solid extract, 2-3 times daily); bilberry (up to 80 mg in capsule form, 3 times daily); Boswellia serrata, an Ayurvedic herb (150 mg, 3 times daily); turmeric, yucca, and devil’s claw; (as a combination formula, take 3-4 capsules, 3 times daily); cayenne ointment rubbed into the skin at the arthritic areas; sea cucumber extract (follow product instructions). Herbal bromelain contains the traditional arthritis herbs mentioned above, plus black cohosh, ginger, celery, onion, and feverfew.<p>
	<b>Other Therapies</b>. The following supportive therapies may also bring relief: DHEA hormone supplementation; alternating hot and cold packs on the affected area; bee venom injections; exercise, such as swimming and isometrics; and chiropractic adjustments to correct structural abnormalities (legs that are different lengths, postural problems).<p>

<a name="stay"><h4>STAY SEXUALLY FIT DURING MALE MENOPAUSE</h4></a>

	It’s well known that in most men over 50, the body’s levels of testosterone, the prime male sex hormone, start to decline. Symptoms of testosterone deficiency can typically include fatigue, lowered sex drive, slower hair growth, less virility, sometimes impotence, and a weakening of the muscles and testicles. Other men, of course, remain robustly healthy and virile into their eighties. <p>
	Is there a male menopause? Sandra Cabot, M.D., suggests there might be more fact than myth to this idea. While male hormone replacement therapy is an option, there is also a nutritional strategy men can apply that can start improving the functioning of their endocrine system (the source of all hormones) and their testicles. Here are Dr. Cabot’s daily male menopause recommendations:<p>

<ul>

<li>Vitamin E: 500 I.U. 
<li>Magnesium: 500 mg 
<li>Zinc: 50 mg
<li>Selenium: 50 mcg
<li>Manganese: 5 mg
<li>Ginseng: 2000-4000 mg
<li>Royal Jelly: 2000-4000 mg
<li>Balanced B vitamin complex: 1 tablet
<li>Evening primrose oil: 3000 mg

</ul>

Dr. Cabot’s male meno-pause kit, taken daily, is designed to help the male body cope with the natural decline of testosterone. Ginseng, for example, acts as a glandular tonic, helping to improve the function of the testicles. Royal Jelly, rich in choline, indirectly helps improve sexual performance and response. Evening primrose oil supplies fatty acids that aid the production and release of hormones. Zinc can boost male virility and reduce prostate problems such as swelling. Vitamin E and magnesium strengthen the heart and blood circulation, including blood supply to the pelvic region.<p>
