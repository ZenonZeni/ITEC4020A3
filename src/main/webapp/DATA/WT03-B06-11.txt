Betting on confidence in the New Year

Harnessing the energy he used on the campaign trail, the French
president seeks to reopen a dialogue with the people. He hopes
his confidence will be contagious.
In his New Year's message on 31 December 1995, President Jacques
Chirac promised the French a moratorium on tax hikes, a dialogue
on employment and a Europe more focused on social issues.
After emphasizing that "Europe is now more necessary to us than
ever," Chirac declared that he would push the European Union to
make jobs a priority, to be more attentive to daily concerns and
to do more to "meet the social aspirations" of the French.
Chirac admitted that the year-end turmoil could have caused some
to lose the hopes they had held upon his election. The president,
who was voted into office on 7 May 1995, said he would see to it
that such hopes were not dashed. At the same time, he paid
tribute to the "courageous action" of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
In doing so, he bolstered the position of Juppe, whose reform of
the social security system--an institution dear to the French but
in near-bankruptcy--sparked the wave of strikes in key public
sectors, particularly the railways.
In late October, Chirac, a Gaullist who made the battle against
"social divisions" one of his campaign themes, chose to achieve
this goal by reforming government spending. Chirac aims to
decrease France's government deficit from 5 to 3 percent of the
gross domestic product by 1997--a necessary move for French
finances and a condition set in the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union for moving to a single currency by 1999.
In the televised message from his office at the Elysee Palace,
the French leader also promised to hold off on tax increases and
to intensify the battle against unemployment. In addition, he
resolved to lower obligatory withholding taxes, noting that he
had asked the government "to stop resorting to new tax hikes and
social expenditures and to lower these as soon as possible."
Juppe had already announced such a future moratorium.
A new tax, the RDS, or reimbursement of social debt, will be
instituted on February 1 to progressively bring down the $40
billion Social Security deficit.
Chirac also expressed his hope that 1996 will "bring a collective
commitment to adjust and reduce working hours, to encourage
employment and help young people get jobs." Unemployment affects
3 million people in France, 11.5 percent of the work force.
The president ended his speech with the wish that France "embark
upon the future with confidence, because it has chosen progress
and solidarity."

Financing peace

Following the signing in Washington of the interim agreement on
28 September 1995, representatives of the foreign aid community,
Israel and the Palestinian Authority met in Paris on 9 January
1996. The total to be made available to the Palestinian people by
the foreign aid contributors in 1996 is more than $1.365 billion.
Ministers pledged to give a new boost to the aid effort for the
Palestinian people and provide additional support for the peace
and reconciliation process under way in the region.
The participants expressed their firm intention to contribute to
the success of the peace process. According to the French
government, during the ministerial conference, "we have made
commitments. They must be translated into deeds." That is why the
contributors emphasized the importance they attach to the
elections due to take place in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on 20
January 1996.
The conference participants emphasized the importance of
improving the economic and social conditions of the Palestinian
people by creating jobs, improving infrastructures and laying the
foundations for sustained economic development.
In April 1995, the Palestinian Authority,  Israeli government and
the international community adopted a three-pronged plan of
action, designed to reduce the Palestinian budget deficit and
stimulate economic development. The participants welcomed the
signing of a new version of this agreement which takes into
account recent economic and political developments. The Israeli
government will support and facilitate Palestinian economic
development, while the international community has agreed to
contribute to the development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian Authority also emphasized the importance of the
basic investment program, adopted unanimously by the Palestinian
cabinet and presented by the Palestinian Authority at the meeting
of the World Bank's consultative group on 18-19 October 1995.
This program, which stresses economic development and job
creation, involves investments totaling 500 million dollars.
Investment projects include roads, wells, schools, hospitals and
water- and infrastructure-related projects.
The aid contributors demonstrated their support for the basic
$550 million investment program and other priority projects
presented by the Palestinian Authority, including the
establishment of industrial zones, the ongoing aid program and
financing of the current $75 million account deficit.
The total to be made available by the foreign aid community in
1996 is more than $1.365 billion. Furthermore, a number of
contributing countries will continue to provide an appreciable
level of aid in kind.

Cult alert

France was warned last week that more tragedies like December's
murder-suicide of 16 members of the Order of the Solar Temple are
possible, and the government was urged to keep closer watch on
cults. A parliamentary commission has urged the government to set
up a special body to monitor such groups.
The commission said cults had the potential to grow rapidly in
France. "In the light of the evidence, the state cannot allow
what many believe to be a veritable tidal wave to develop within
its core,'' the panel said in its report, released in Paris.
The report estimated that there are about 173 cult groups in
France plus another 800 smaller affiliated entities, and
estimated their total membership in France at about 160,000
people. It said a new watchdog body should be set up under the
auspices of the prime minister's office with doctors, legal
experts and sociologists among its members. Its role should be to
monitor cults in cooperation with the various ministries, inform
the prime minister of any developing problems and propose
strategies for handling potentially dangerous activities.
"To remain passive would not only be irresponsible with regard to
those who are affected (by cults) or open to their influence, but
a threat to the democratic principles on which our republic is
founded. It is thus necessary to act.''
The report appeared less than three weeks after the discovery in
a remote Alpine area in southeastern France of 16 bodies
belonging to the Order of the Solar Temple, a cult based in
Switzerland.

The Pope in France in September

Pope John Paul II will visit France in September of this year,
for the 1,500th anniversary of Roman Catholicism as France's
principal religion. The Pope will be in the country from
September 19 to 22, for his sixth visit to France. He will visit
the Loire valley, Brittany and  Reims. In 496, King Clovis
converted to Christianity and was the first ruler to submit
himself to the authority of the Church, giving France the
traditional name of the "oldest daughter of the Church."
The fifth underground nuclear test took place on December 27. The
energy released was less than 30 kilotons.

l'Evenement en bref

Last issue
The low-cost, full-color daily InfoMatin published its last issue
January 8, two years after its launching. Despite a strong start
with sales above 200,000 copies in January 1994, circulation
quickly dropped to 70,000 copies. It needed to sell 130,000 to
break even. One week later the major conservative French daily Le
Figaro celebrated its 170th anniversary.
Botton affair
The appeals court of Lyon handed down stiffer sentences than the
original court's ruling to the three principal defendants in the
Botton political corruption affair. Pierre Botton had been
charged with misappropriating $5 million from firms he controlled
and with making payments to former Lyon mayor Michel Noir and
current Cannes mayor Michel Mouillot to gain influence and public
contracts. The court gave the two mayors suspended 18-month jail
terms, and sentenced Botton to three and a half years in prison.
Popularity
President Chirac and Prime Minister Juppe enjoyed a higher
approval rate to begin 1996, according to the Louis Harris
polling institute. Jacques Chirac's job performance is considered
positive by 41 percent (up 13 percent) of the French while Alain
Juppe received a job performance rate of 34 percent (up 7
percent). Despite this improvement, 59 percent of the French
believe that the government is going in the wrong direction.

Popular and solemn

Former President Francois Mitterrand, who died peacefully in his
apartment at the age of 79 only eight months after leaving
office, preferred an intimate burial to a state funeral. A
military band played Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," the anthem of the
European Union that Mitterrand worked so hard to build during his
14 years in office, as the flag-draped oak coffin carried by
military pallbearers set out through the narrow streets of
Jarnac, his birthplace. Two hundred fifty miles away in the
nation's capital, world leaders bade farewell to the Socialist
leader at a requiem mass, with 1,300 French and foreign
dignitaries present in Notre Dame Cathedral led by Cardinal
Jean-Marie Lustiger.
German chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mitterrand's partner in more than
a decade of energetic European integration, wept openly in Notre
Dame and Cuban president Fidel Castro, one of 65 heads of state
and government present, also cried. Kohl, the head of state who
had met with Mitterrand the most, mourned "a good friend," adding
that  "Europe [had] lost a great statesman."
President Clinton said "the entire world benefited from his
strong and principled leadership,'' calling him a "man of
vision'' (see next page).
Before the Paris services, Mitterrand's Gaullist successor
Jacques Chirac met Russian president Boris Yeltsin and American
vice president Al Gore at the Elysee Palace.
British Prime Minister John Major and U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali were among the foreign mourners. "President
Mitterrand was a very big figure in European history. It will be
recognized in due course by history," said Major. Margaret
Thatcher, despite political differences, "liked and respected"
Mitterrand, adding that he "had become for the rest of the world
a symbol of the essence of France."
From the Middle East, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli
prime minister Shimon Peres and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak
sat close to each other in the cathedral.
Peres, a fellow Socialist and old friend, said Mitterrand's
message was universal and reached far beyond France's borders.
Calling the late president "an unusual combination of culture and
justice,'' Peres said: "We shall miss him very much.''
In Jarnac, the town of 5,000 in southwestern France where
Mitterrand was born in 1916, a private mass was held in Saint
Pierre Church before Mitterrand was buried in the family tomb.
His widow Danielle, sons Gilbert and Jean-Christophe, Mazarine,
his daughter born out of wedlock, her mother Anne Pingeot and
former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas attended the ceremony.
"Adieu" was the most frequently used word in French newspapers,
many of which published photos of a huge public tribute at Paris'
Place de la Bastille held the day before, beneath a giant poster
of Mitterrand waving goodbye. Tens of thousands of supporters
laid red roses, the symbol of the Socialist Party, at the square
and outside the floodlit residence near the Eiffel Tower where he
died. Many wept in the square, a rallying point for the French
Left since the 1789 French Revolution, especially when American
soprano Barbara Hendricks sang "Le Temps des Cerises," anthem of
the 1871 Paris Commune rebels.
According to a poll conducted at the request of state-owned
television station France 2 and the weekly Le Point, Francois
Mitterrand was considered a "great statesman" by an overwhelming
93 percent of French citizens.
As the famous Edith Piaf song goes and as those paying hommage at
the Bastille cried, "Non, rien de rien, je ne regrette rien."

Death of Francois Mitterrand

Excerpts from a speech by President Jacques Chirac
Paris, 8 January 1996
"My dear compatriots,
President Francois Mitterrand died this morning. The French
people learned with shock of the passing of the man who guided
them over 14 years.
I would like not only to salute the memory of the statesman, but
also to pay tribute to the man, with his rich and complex
character.
Francois Mitterrand--his works. A great reader and lover of fine
books, writing for him was as natural as breathing. (...)
Francois Mitterrand--his resolve. The resolve to serve certain
ideals. Solidarity and social justice. The humanist message of
which our country is the bearer and which is rooted in the very
heart of our traditions. Europe, one in which France, reconciled
with Germany and working with it, would occupy a leading place.
But also a way of living our democracy. A modern, now calm
democracy, thanks in particular to the smooth changeover of
political power. (...)
In politics, Francois Mitterrand had first of all a profound
respect for the individual, and that is why he decided to abolish
the death penalty. A respect too for human rights:  he
continually stepped in wherever they were flouted. (...)
But it is, I believe, Francois Mitterrand's life which is
paramount. (...) He espoused his century. Over 50 years spent in
the center of the political arena, at the heart of things in the
process of being achieved. The war. The Resistance. The elected
offices. (...)
But Francois Mitterrand cannot be reduced to his career. He lived
his life more than to the full because he had a passion for life,
one which nurtured and allowed his dialogue with death. Life in
all its forms. Life in its dark and its glorious moments. The
life of the land, of our countryside, of that rural France he
loved so much, almost carnally (...).
Because he had a passion for friendship, loyalty to friends was
for him an article of faith, which prevailed over all others. He
aroused in return deep loyalties, through the years and trials.
My situation is a singular one, since I was President Francois
Mitterrand's adversary. But I was also his prime minister and am
today his successor. All this creates a special tie, which
includes respect for the statesman and admiration for the private
man who fought illness with remarkable courage, in a sense,
eyeing it with disdain, and constantly winning victories over it.
From these contrasting, but longstanding relations, I have
learned the strength of courage when it is backed up by
willpower, the need to put the human being at the center of any
project and the importance of experience.
In this evening of mourning in our country, I extend my feelings
of respect and sympathy to Madame Mitterrand and her family. As
Francois Mitterrand becomes part of history, I should like us to
ponder his message."

A dependable, yet independent ally

Mitterrand embodied the traditional mixture of solid fraternity
in critical situations and small irritants that characterizes the
friendship between France and the United States.
During his 14 years as French president, Francois Mitterrand
proved to be a dependable and yet independent ally to three
American presidents, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton.
The solid bond of longstanding friendship uniting France and the
United States was in no way compromised by political differences
between the Socialist French President and Ronald Reagan.
Mitterrand stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States
during the Soviet challenges of the early 1980s, the Gulf War and
the peaceful revolutions that ended East-West divisions, as
President Clinton recalled on January 9, two days before Vice
President Al Gore headed the U.S. delegation to the former
leader's funeral.
French support at the end of the Cold War proved to be essential,
as evidenced by Francois Mitterrand's key speech before the
German Bundestag in 1983 stating that "pacifism is in the West
and euromissiles are in the East" at a time when German public
opinion was opposed to the deployment of Pershing 2s. This
endorsment of American policy in Europe coming from the leader of
Germany's closest friend, a country long known for putting great
store in its independence toward the superpowers, had tremendous
impact.
President Clinton paid tribute to Francois Mitterrand, calling
him "a man of vision'' whose stalwart leadership helped end the
Cold War and unify Europe. "Not only France but the United States
and the entire world benefited from his strong and principled
leadership,'' Clinton said.
"I consulted frequently with President Mitterrand, as did my
predecessors, and greatly valued his insights, advice and wisdom.
He was a man of vision whose strength helped bring Europe and the
West through a period of tough confrontation to the peaceful,
undivided Europe we are building today.''
These sentiments were echoed by former President George Bush who
worked closely with Mitterrand during the 1991 Gulf War.
''Francois Mitterrand was a great friend and steadfast ally for
the United States. He was a man of his word, and I had great
respect for his intellect and his innate sense of decency. To be
sure, he was one of the great leaders of our time,'' said Bush.
"He laid aside the historic Iraq-French relationship to make a
point that aggression should not stand, that a bully cannot take
over another country, that one member of the United Nations must
not subjugate and wipe out the sovereignty of another,'' Bush
told France-3 television from his Texas home,  referring to the
Gulf War.

"We are the Mitterrand Generation"

It started 10 May 1981. That day, the election of France's first
Socialist president of the Fifth Republic marked the birth of
what would be dubbed seven years later in a reelection slogan the
"Mitterrand generation"--an age group too young to take a serious
interest in Valery Giscard d'Estaing's presidency and which
would, from 1981 to 1995, know one sole occupant of the Elysee
Palace--Francois Mitterrand.
For many, that May 10 was a cause for major celebration, but
others feared the Red Army itself would march down the Champs
Elysees. In 1981, its shadow still loomed large and the Eastern
bloc and the Iron Curtain were realities. This fear was, of
course, unfounded, but came from a generation which had grown up
with the Cold War.
The Mitterrand generation, however, over the course of time had
to reevaluate a large part of what they had been obligated to
learn to earn their baccalaureats: the Berlin wall fell, borders
changed, atlases become obsolete, the Soviet bloc fell apart and
the European Union continued to grow, despite it all.
These same young people witnessed major changes on the
technological front as well. The high-speed train (TGV) became a
reality in 1981, and Great Britain would no longer be considered
the "isolated kingdom" thanks to the Eurotunnel built beneath the
English Channel. The Mitterrand generation learned to use the
Minitel and, later, PCs, laptops and the Internet. Computers,
which made a limited appearance in lycees at the end of the
1970s, were suddenly accessible to everybody.
The Mitterrand generation contributed to the emergence of new
social and humanitarian causes. They gave money to finance air
shipments of rice and medicine to the starving in Somalia,
attended concerts by their favorite singers to raise money for
Armenian earthquake victims and rallied around the comedian
Coluche and his "Restos du Coeur" (see NFF 95-20, p.6) for the
poor and homeless.
  They witnessed the emergence of the suburbs as an entity that
felt the need to express itself--often violently. The children of
immigrants (mostly from North Africa) constituted an important
part of the Mitterrand generation, and SOS-Racisme leader Harlem
Desir became the spokesman for an integration movement that would
see the wearing of the Islamic scarf in the classroom become a
major issue throughout the country.
   In the arts world, the Mitterrand generation even had its own
Minister of Culture in Jack Lang. Rap music, which took root in
the surburbs, found its place on the official list of
"beaux-arts" thanks to Lang, whom they considered "incredibly
hip."
What lessons did the Mitterrand generation learn from its 14
years with the President? Maybe the acceptance of all sorts of
"cohabitation": pleasure and morality, show business and
humanitarian crusades, a Gaullist prime minister and a Socialist
president.
Toward the end of his second presidential term, Francois
Mitterrand stated in his own self-effacing manner," Just think
that for as long as young people aged 15 to 20 have been
politically aware, they have known only me. If I were in their
shoes, I'd be a little tired."

A lifetime serving France

Francois Mitterrand was born on 26 October 1916 in Jarnac
(Charente). His father was then employed by the Paris-Orleans
Railway Company.
After studying law, arts and political science at the University
of Paris, Francois Mitterrand was drafted into the army in 1939.
Wounded, taken prisoner and transferred to a camp in the middle
of Germany during the Second World War, he escaped successfully
at his third attempt in 1942. On his return to France, he
immediately joined the Resistance. Sent on missions to London and
Algiers-- where he was received by General de Gaulle -- he was
keen to return to Occupied France to continue the fight there,
which he did on 26 February 1944. In the underground movement, de
Gaulle appointed Mitterrand Secretary-General for Prisoners of
War, Deportees and Refugees. In this capacity, he took part in
the first Council meeting of the French Republic's Provisional
Government in liberated Paris on 27 August 1944.
In 1944, he married Danielle Gouze, whom he met in the
Resistance. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre at the age of 18.
They went on to have two sons, Jean-Christophe and Gilbert.
In 1945, Mitterrand joined the Union Democratique et Socialiste
de la Resistance (UDSR), formed out of various Resistance
movements. In 1946, he was elected Deputy for Nievre. He remained
a member of Parliament for this department until May 1981, except
for four months in 1958. He represented Nievre in the Senate from
1959 to 1962. During those 35 years, he held numerous local
elective posts, including those of mayor of Chateau-Chinon,
general councillor of Montsauche, president of the Association of
Mayors and president of the Nievre General Council.
During the 12 years of the Fourth Republic (from 1946 to 1958)
Mitterrand held office in several governments. In 1947, at the
age of 30, he was the youngest minister in a century. His
ministerial career was marked by a number of initiatives
heralding, starting in 1950, the decolonization of Black Africa.
In May 1958, Francois Mitterrand became one of the main
opposition leaders.
In the 1965 presidential election, he was the sole candidate of
the Left. He won 32 percent of the votes cast in the first ballot
and in the second, on 19 December 1965, when General de Gaulle
was re-elected, 45 percent of the electors voted for Francois
Mitterrand.
On 16 June 1971, at the Epinay Congress, Mitterrand was elected
first secretary of the Socialist party, an office he held until
1981. In June 1972, on behalf of the Socialists, he concluded an
agreement with the French Communist party and left-wing radicals:
the Common Government Program of the Parties of the Left.
In the 1974 presidential election, Mitterrand was again the
Left's sole candidate. In the second ballot, he won 49.19 percent
of the votes. Valery Giscard d'Estaing obtained 50.81 percent and
was thus elected.
On 10 May 1981, Francois Mitterrand won 51.75 percent of the
votes cast and became president of the French Republic. On 8 May
1988, he obtained 54.02 percent of the vote and was reelected
president of the French Republic. This second term ended on 17
May 1995.

Summary of articles previously published by News from France

"France is our homeland, Europe, our future"
Francois Mitterrand's steadfast commitment to a united Europe was
one unwavering point in his diplomatic policy. The president of
the Republic referred to the eventual unification of Europe as
the  the most important undertaking of our generation. This
unflinching will to serve Europe earned him the nickname
"Mitterrand the European."
--NFF05/12/95--
From the Cold War to a New World Order
During his long tenure as president of the Republic, Francois
Mitterrand had shown himself to be a loyal ally of Western
nations. However, his achievements in foreign policy are not
limited to the confines of the Continent. President Mitterrand
had never wavered in his convictions concerning the Arab-Israeli
conflict, declaring himself to be both a friend of Israel and a
proponent of Palestinian self-determination. The French praise
Mitterrand for the prestige that he brought to their nation on
the international stage.
-NFF04/28/95-
Fourteen years of domestic policy
Elected president on 10 May 1981, Mitterrand quickly left his
mark on French domestic policy through the abolition of the death
penalty in October  1981. During Mitterrand's first months in
office, important laws to protect workers were enacted. On the
economic front, the priority was lowering the inflation rate and
building a strong franc. When Mitterrand was re-elected in May
1988, he stressed political reconciliation and unity. In November
1988, the "minimum income for integration" (RMI) was created as a
safety net for those individuals who were not eligible for
unemployment benefits.

Fifty years in politics
Francois Mitterrand had a rich political experience before
serving two terms as president of the Republic. He was the first
Socialist to lead the Fifth Republic and the second Socialist
president in French history. With the parliamentary victory of
the Right in 1986, then-Prime Minister Laurent Fabius stepped
down and a period of  "cohabitation" began with Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac. In 1988 Mitterrand became the first president to
be elected twice through universal suffrage.
-NFF04/28/95-
Cultural advocate
Under Mitterrand's presidencies, education was accorded top
priority. In 1991, it was allotted for the first time in the
history of France, the largest portion of the budget, exceeding
military expenses. Speaking on the importance of education and
the transfer of knowledge, Francois Mitterrand said, "They must
be the permanent underlying fundamental preoccupation of all
political leaders."

Where did all the farmers go?

The farming workforce is six times smaller than 50 years ago,
according to a study published by the National Statistics
Institute.
The report emphasizes the dramatic change in farming with the
normalization of French agriculture which moved closer to western
standards through concentration, mechanization and education.
Ten million people were dependent on agriculture for their
livelihood in 1945. Farming households accounted for 2.5 million
in 1993. Young people and women in particular have left the farm.
Hence the farming population has become older and more male.
Thirty percent of the farmers aged 30 to 34 were bachelors in
1993 compared with 18 percent in 1978.
This decline in marriage is not offset by couples living
together, a situation that barely exists in the farming
population. In the early 1960s, almost every spouse was working
on the farm; 40 percent now work outside.
Concentration is the other major trend of the last 40 years, with
the average farming surface increasing from 34,500 acres to
87,000 acres. This was made possible by mechanization. The number
of tractors increased from 100,000 in 1948 to 1.4 million in
1993. Progress in productivity  also explains the fact that the
amount of working hours have decreased three fold, compared with
30 years ago.
Half of farms are specialized in livestock farming, 18 percent in
general agriculture and 12 percent in viticulture. The
modernization of agriculture and the generalization of modern
farm machinery have made it necessary to restructure by
regrouping parcels of land under cultivation, and mechanization
has resulted in greatly increased productivity.
The decline in the agricultural population has been encouraged by
the lowering of the farmers' retirement age to 60 in 1986,
resulted in the rejuvenation of the sector. Older farmers used to
work with their sons, who would subsequently take over from them.
This is no longer the case as retired farmers tend to leave the
land. Less than a third of retiring farmers are
replaced--generally by their sons--compared with half in the
1960s. Meanwhile farmers have become more skilled and educated,
as farming is now being considered a profession like any other.
   French agricultural production represents approximately 23
percent of E.U. production as a whole, making France Europe's
number-one farm country. Agriculture accounted for 2.5 percent of
the commercial GDP in 1993 and the added value of the
food-processing industry for 3.4 percent. The trade account in
the food-processing sector (raw materials and manufactured
products) hit 56.9 billion francs ($10.3 billion) in 1993,
exceeding by 3.3 billion francs ($0.6 billion) its 1992 record.
In addition, the trade surplus in food products reached 24.7
billion francs ($4 billion) in 1993, 4.8 billion ($0.8 billion)
more than in 1992. In value, France is the world's second biggest
exporter of processed foods after the United States.

Corsican dialogue

Prime Minister Alain Juppe set up last tuesday a new ministerial
group to work out social and economic plans for the French
Mediterranean island of Corsica but ruled out bowing to
nationalist demands for autonomy.
Juppe met parliamentarians from the island, rocked by 44 bomb
attacks so far in 1996 after 602 in 1995, and asserted that Paris
would reassert the rule of law in Corsica. The inter-ministerial
working group will submit proposals on Corsica's economic and
social problems. The prime minister indicated that "a
modification of the institutions of the island was not on the
agenda."
A few days beforehand, Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre paved
the way for dialogue between the state and Corsican nationalists
during a two day visit to the island. Preceding the visit, the
hardline "historic wing'' of the outlawed Corsican National
Liberation Front (FLNC) called a three-month truce in bombings at
a secretive news conference, with a show of force by about 600
hooded and heavily-armed men.
Following several meetings with elected officials of the island,
Debre stated "the moment has come to move on to a positive
dialogue." A dialogue should help "solve the three great chapters
of the Corsican problem ...The state will remain in Corsica just
as Corsica will remain in France," he reminded his audience.

Societe en bref

Vigipirate scaled down
From the implementation of the security plan "Vigipirate" on
September 7, to December 18, 70,500 people were taken in for
questioning where an eventual 21,540 people were charged with
crimes or misdemeanors, and some 2,324 were deported. In
addition, increased border controls led to 19,972 people being
denied entrance into France. The anti-terrorism plan "Vigipirate"
was scaled down earlier this week.
Ariane launches U.S. satellite
Western Europe's 82nd Ariane rocket blasted off into space from
French Guiana last Friday, putting a U.S. and a Malaysian
communications satellite into orbit. The launch capacity of their
new Ariane-5 rocket will be increased by more than a ton in the
next five years, enabling it to put two heavy satellites into
space simultaneously and meet booming demand for commercial
launches.
Babies
The birth rate continues to drop in metropolitan France, but
city-dwelling women (except those in Paris) have more children
than their counterparts living in the country, according to the
National Statitics Institute (INSEE). In rural areas, women are
having fewer children--a recent evolution, since in 1975 the
birth rate in the country was five to ten percent above the
national average.
Urban activism
Just before the announcement of the prime minister's plan to aid
the suburbs, SOS-Racisme and the National Federation of Youth
Centers (Maison des Potes) announced that a Conference on
Neighborhoods will take place on February 3 and 4. More than 300
urban activists will get together to try to find answers to the
problems confronting urban youths--juvenile delinquency, drug
abuse, housing and unemployment.
Denise Grey is dead
Denise Grey, doyenne of the French acting world, whose career
spanned three-quarters of a century, died last Saturday at the
age of 99.

From Minitel to Internet

France Telecom announced last Friday its policy concerning the
Internet and the evolution of the Minitel.
France Telecom, which founded the world's first on-line service
with the Minitel, is confronting the stagnation of this service
and the arrival of the Internet which is rapidly becoming the
standard on-line service worldwide.
The company announced that all French citizens will now have
access to the Internet at a local billing rate (8 to 25 centimes
per minute) starting March 15 via their Transpac network. The
provider will pay to have access to Transpac (13,200 francs per
month per 400 subscribers) and will then charge its subscribers
the nominal fee of 25 francs per month, according to France
Telecom. Subscribers currently pay between 60 and 200 francs on
average per month, plus communication costs.
The service will offer e-mail, access to newsgroups, a navigation
guide in French, Internet access to Minitel services, and a
cyberspace shopping site, Wanadoo. The company's decision to
provide its own Internet service follows in the footsteps of
Lagardere, Europe on Line, and already well-established services
like the American firm CompuServe, which currently has 35,000
subscribers in France.
France Telecom's strategy is two-pronged--first, investing in the
Internet, and second, improving available services on the
Minitel, which has been a longtime fixture in many French
households. There are currently 6.5 million Minitel terminals and
14 million users. Aiming at this market, France Telecom has
introduced a new terminal, dubbed the Magis Club, which is eight
times faster than current machines and permits credit card
payments from home.
Francois Beneviste, president of the provider Calvacom and the
French Association of Internet Professionals, praised France
Telecom's decision saying, "It's an excellent measure that will
completely open up the market and make France unique in the
world."
The public operator took to heart the wish expressed by
telecommunications minister Francois Fillon last October to see
French citizens have easy Internet access that would be billed at
local rates. "We must make sure that new developments in
technology do not lead to a two-speed France and that our country
is not behind in the world development of the Internet," Fillon
stated. He praised France Telecom's steps to make the information
superhighway more accessible to all French citizens.

Coup d'Oeil

The French government has enacted a new law to give French
recording artists a chance against more heavily marketed U.S. and
British songs. The law requires that 40 percent of songs played
between 6:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. be of French origin.
Broadcasters risk fines or suspension from the air if they defy
the quotas, which are to be supervised by the government's
broadcasting watchdog. The law has drawn much criticism. French
singer Charles Aznavour defended the quotas saying, "I think it's
sad that we've come to this, but it's something that's become
inevitable, a question of cultural survival."
Archeologists said this past Tuesday they have discovered signs
of human civilization dating back 50,000 years in a cave in
southwestern France, making it the earliest evidence of
cave-dwelling humans. French government archeologists worked
secretly on the site in the town of Bruniquel for the last five
years. "Carbon-14 dating allowed us to scientifically establish
that a bone fragment dates back at least 47,000 years," stated
archeologist Francois Rouzaud. The cave is in the same corner of
France as the world-famous Lascaux caves, which house paintings
and engravings dating back to about 15,000 B.C.
