BUSINESS
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Singapore Telecom MobileLink has launched its PCN
service after a US$48m investment in hardware from
Northern Telecom. The service is being marketed
alongside all existing cellular services in operation
with pricing pitched towards the private user. The
installation process has not been that easy.
According to Pascal Debon, VP and general manager of
Nortel GSM Wireless Networks: "In Singapore, Nortel
had to face geographical and technical challenges due
to a very high population density, high-rise
buildings and expressways tunnels.  Specific
equipment has been successfully developed to adapt to
this particularly complex environment and to optimize
the indoor coverage." A number of PCN roaming
agreements are being planned as PCN service rolls
out.

Northern Telecom has revealed that it has advanced
the launch dates of expansion for a Taiwanese GSM
cellular network, bringing it up to five months ahead
of schedule due to tremendous user demand. In
September 1994 the Long Distance Telecommunications
Administration awarded a US$100m supply contract to
Nortel for a GSM digital cellular system in Taiwan
and the network has been operational in phases with
160,000 users online by the end of October with
10,000 new subscribers signing up for service each

Vodac Ltd, the Vodafone Group Plc cellular service

to corporate customers including the provision of
cellular telephony bills on computer disk through the
so-called Call Manager software package.  Customers
have to pay GBP25 per month to receive accounts on

authority card' which allows corporate customers to
receive a repair service from any Vodac Service
Centre throughout the UK and the account can be
settled directly with Vodac. In the new year Vodafone
plans to emulate the 24-hour repair/replacement
scheme first pioneered by Hutchison Telecom/Orange
which will allow customers to get prompt replacement
for faulty cellular equipment, although details are
presently not known.

MOBILE MATTERS-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE AWARDED
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

The Austrian government has awarded the first
competitive GSM cellular licence to a consortium
backed by Siemens and Deutsche Telekom known as Oe-Call.  
Oe-Call bid US$397m for the licence -- the
highest of the five applicants.  Viktor Klima,
transport minister for the Austrian government, said
that the competing service was forecast to bring down
prices by as much as 30%. Some competing consortia
said that the bid was unfair as Siemens was an
important equipment supplier to the Austrian Post
Office -- operators of the other GSM service.  An
appeal is permitted under Austrian law although to
date no company has said that it intends to take
advantage of this option.

Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd in the UK
has given a pledge to the Office of Fair Trading
stating that it will not breach the Resale Prices
Act. The OFT previously launched an investigation
after receiving numerous complaints from dealers who
said that Orange was attempting to impose minimum
resale prices on mobile phone handsets. Under the
Resale Prices Act 1976, it is unlawful for a supplier
of goods to make it a condition of supply that its
goods will not be sold below a specified price. Many
dealers had experienced sudden problems getting new
stock once they had sold phones at a price other than
Orange's recommended price.

Peoples Phone, a large UK independent cellular

Stock Exchange early this year, making its founder
Charles Wigoder a multi-millionaire in the process.
Analysts expect the company to be valued at around
GBP200m although Peoples Phone was not exactly a
rags-to-riches affair for the 35-year-old son of
Liberal peer Lord Wigoder.  The company has rapidly
expanded since its formation in 1988 to a company
turning over GBP118.5m in 1994 through its 175
brightly-decorated retail outlets -- capturing a 7%
stake of the UK market.

MOBILE MATTERS-TEXAN PAGING FIRMS HIT OUT AT LOCAL
TAXATION
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Paging companies in Texas, USA are angry about a new
taxation plan which will, according to them, provide
an unfair burden on their businesses when compared to
other sectors. A tax has been introduced to create a
US$150m fund which will help schools and hospitals
purchase equipment to connect up the information
superhighway, with half of the funding coming from an
assessment on local telephone companies, the other
half from the wireless industry, comprising mainly of
cellular and paging businesses. The wireless industry
contends that they are a smaller business with annual
revenues of around US$1.5bn compared to the wireline
businesses which generate around US$8bn annually.
Administratively, this is causing some problems for
local authority officials as the telecommunications
levy has to raise a fixed amount of money from an
indeterminate number of companies with unpredictable
revenue.  A number of workaround solutions are under
consideration.

According to the UK government's Radiocommunications
Agency, the new Short Range Business Radio service
(SRBR) is set to be introduced in early 1996 which
will allow parties to use their own equipment with a
range of up to 400m without restrictions on
portability or location. The Agency believes that the
SRBR will be of particular use to small businesses
who will be able to take advantages of speech and
paging services on a localised site basis. A licence
costing GBP30 will be required covering a three year
period, although in reality observers suggest that
enforcement will be difficult. Frequencies for SRBR
will be: 461.2625MHz, 461.4750MHz and 461.4875MHz,
for the speech service and 49.2625MHz, 49.2875MHz and
461.3000MHz for the paging service.

PHILIPS COMMUNICATIONS says that its RBS918
GSM/DCS1800 radio base stations recently helped deal
with the world's busiest GSM network, located at the
Telecom  95 exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland. Four
out of the five base stations which covered the
Palexpo site were from Philips and they managed the
highest traffic load ever measured in a GSM network
and successfully mastered a peak traffic load of
about 360,000 calls per day.  Philips said that the
service problem was exacerbated because there were
only a limited number of frequencies available for
GSM as part of the spectrum is still used by the
analogue NMT900 system, that interference to both
French GSM networks had to be considered and that the
large surface of Lake Geneva causes difficult
propagation conditions. Load of the radio channels
reached up to 99.9% frequently throughout the event.

COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Hutchison Orange, operators of a UK PCN service, has
changed the way they distribute products to the
channel, much to the chagrin of retailers.  A range
of new and existing handsets are now being made
available to dealers at full trade prices with
commission paid upon connection.  When Orange first
launched it sold units at net prices to dealers who
then sold on mark-up. The company claimed that it was
breathing a breath of fresh air into the cellular
marketplace although it denies that it has made a
sudden about turn.   Orange dealers will also be able
to earn extra commission by signing up customers to
higher price plans, based on marketing support
programmes and gimmicky offers.  "Orange if convinced
these proposals will ensure the competitiveness of
the trade proposition for 1996, building on the
excellent results seen since the launch of Orange,"
claimed Gareth Jones, group director of sales.

The Metropolitan Police has started the rollout of
its new force-wide trunked radio service known as
Metradio. The service is being rolled out on a
sector-by-sector basis and the Met hopes for all of
 1 Area' to be on the system by the end of February. 
Once the programme of installation is eventually
completed, over 18,000 operational officers will be
using the UHF-based trunked system.  Senior officers
say that the network will provide a number of
benefits to policing including secure communications,
better speech quality, pooling of frequencies,
greater security for officers and a more reliable
service.

MOBILE MATTERS-CLAMPDOWN ON UK MOBILE PHONE USERS
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Several cellular service providers are clamping down
on their customers mobile phone usage in a bid to cut
fraud.  One network reseller has already placed a
ceiling of GBP50-worth of calls without a deposit
being paid and large deposits are being demanded off
GSM digital cellular users who wish to take full
advantage of cellular roaming while overseas.
Cellphones Direct, a UK service provider who resells
Vodafone Group airtime, plans to introduce its
cellular ceiling plan in February, despite customer
concern to the plan.  Vodafone and Cellnet, as
network operators, are not responsible for the
charges placed by its reseller agents who deal direct
with members of the public.

The ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY, the British ad
industry watchdog, has clamped down on a number of
firms for their recent breaches of the advertising
code.  PEOPLES PHONE COMPANY PLC has seen a complaint
against it upheld where it offered a free pocket
colour TV on the purchase of a mobile phone.  The
complainant stated that the offer was only valid for
a select number of phones and not the entire range as
implied and noted that the offer was only being
offered for analogue handsets and not the digital
ones.  The company said that the offer applied to all
mobile phones and not all tariffs with the exclusions
listed in footnotes.  The ASA said that the adverts
should have been more clearly stated to avoid
confusion and requested that greater care be taken in
the future. HUTCHISON ORANGE was censured following a
direct mail shot which offered trade-ins through a
dealer which apparently did not exist when the
recipient called local outlets.

digital cellular telephone network during 1996. A
number of roaming agreements have been agreed in
outline with Pacific Bell Mobile Services, American
Portable Telecom, American Personal Communications,

service pricing and exact offerings will be made

delegates at a recent IT conference that the GSM
digital cellular telephony format is likely to become
the de facto  standard of choice' in the United
States, despite the take up of PCS services. Spindler
said that GSM is a model of technological development
because consumer applications were developed rapidly,
cheaply and a standard was adopted quickly by
Europe's telecommunications authorities.
