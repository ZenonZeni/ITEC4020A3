&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thank you to all at Zegrahm for a truly memorable trip <B>`Round Britain</B> in June. When I came to live in this country ten years ago, I planned to see as much of it as I could. Now I believe I have been truly privileged and been able to see more in ten days than most people see their entire lives. Your organization was absolutely excellent in every way, and I was thrilled to receive a copy of the logbook, a reminder of an outstanding trip. Again, many, many thanks, I very much hope to be able to join you again on one of your trips in the future.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Needless to say, the trip around northwestern Australia with all its many highlights was a memorable one - unique in a myriad of ways.  <B>The Kimberley</B> now means more to me than just a remote, virtually untamed areas of the seventh continent! The rich natural beauty of the area, together with your unending knowledge and enthusiasm, to say nothing of your boundless energy, created an experience not soon to be forgotten. I look forward to traveling with you soon again and wish you every success in your endeavors.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <B>Across the Top of Australia</B> expedition certainly adds another extraordinary jewel to Zegrahm's crown. Neither Ruth nor I can see any room for improvement. We found the <I>Coral Princess</I> very comfortable - the crew most attentive and friendly. Max was a superior chef. From the time we arrived in Darwin to our departure in Cairns everything was well planned and executed.  The Mike and Sonja combination is superior. They are friendly, helpful, interested, patient and gentle when answering passenger questions or helping solve any problems.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;April and Polynesia seem so far away. We are counting the days!<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <B>Galapagos</B> defy description - other-worldly, spectacular, fascinating, strange.... Having been a wilderness trip leader some years back - in a little organization where everybody did everything - I am particularly mindful of the extensive behind-the-scenes detail work that makes all the difference between a smooth trip and a chaotic one. Thanks to each of you for the logistics and the clear information you assembled on our behalf.  You all are a class act.<BR>
<I>- Jean, Washington</I><BR>
