<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   Surging tax revenues confirm the economic
recovery Argentina has been waiting for but raise  a time-honored political
temptation: boom-time spending.  &#167;  Economist Javier Gonzalez Fraga takes
issue with the argument that convertibility has outworn its usefulness, and
points to politics and external factors as bigger challenges to the economy.  &#167;
 Falklands authorities rejected a joint YPF/British Gas offshore oil bid for
being too low, but downplayed political implications.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   The government has moved quickly to reduce barriers
to foreign capital after the meteoric rise of  foreign reserves reversed itself,
both reflecting and confirming investor concern over a swelling current account
deficit.  &#167;  Slogging ahead with efforts to consolidate and clean up the
banking sector, the central bank is pressing to overhaul two large regional
banks, while the monetary council has approved a reorganization plan for four
Minas Gerais state banks.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;   The Christian Democrats' poor showing in recent
municipal elections strengthened presidential prospects for the other two
center-left ruling coalition parties and for Joaquin Lavin, a prospective
candidate from the right.  &#167;  Foreign investors will have to prove direct
DL600 investment will go specifically to &quot;productive&quot; ends if they are
to avoid a 30% reserve requirement.  &#167;  The government will award passenger
terminal and freight contracts next year for a $100 million plan to triple the
capacity of the Santiago airport.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   A committee failed to vote on two drug bills that
could repair US-Colombian relations, but  congress had no trouble meeting quorum
to denounce the US ambassador and bringing tensions to a new high. &#167; 
Congressional opposition has taken the teeth out of a plan for raising $420
million through a proposed war bond.  &#167;  Ecopetrol is challenging
government boasts over the size of the oil discovery at Coporo.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   The new economic pact shows the government's
growing confidence that it can afford to loosen the  strings slightly on the
budget and current account, but leaves investors worried about a return to
deficit spending. &#167;  Despite all the fuss over the failure to privatize
secondary petrochemical plants, new petrochemicals legislation is not so bad: it
allows foreign investors full ownership of newly-built facilities.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>PERU</B>  &#167;   A new securities law will allow investors to choose
among more sophisticated financial instruments,  boosting the fund industry.  &#167;
 Snapping up another deal in the region, Argentine oil conglomerate Perez
Companc paid $202 million for rights to Petroperu's Block X.  &#167;  Opposition
groups won a battle allowing them to proceed with a referendum to challenge
President Fujimori's re-election plan.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA  </B> &#167;   The government has set attractive terms for the
billion-dollar November 27 sale of 49% of  telecommunications giant CANTV, in
hopes that a successful sale will lend credibility to its other privatization
aspirations.  &#167;  Growing pressure for judicial reform may prompt President
Caldera to finally address shortfalls that make the legal system a travesty. &#167;
 To soften opposition to oil privatization, the government is making sure
Venezuelans have a chance to get in on the latest marginal oil field
development.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>INSURANCE INDUSTRY REPORT</B>  &#167;   Some of the over-optimistic
missteps taken during a recent two-year  boom are dogging Brazilian insurers who
now face a lull in sales, new competition, skyrocketing auto-theft claims and
high health-care costs. Once the growing pains are over, however, the insurance
industry has plenty of room to expand to take advantage of social security
reform, deregulation, and potential markets for innovative new products.  Pages

<H1>Chile</H1>
<H1>Municipal Elections Set Stage for 1999 Presidential Race</H1>
<P>The Christian Democrat Party (PDC), the main force in the ruling center-left
Concertacion coalition and the country's biggest political party, fared badly in
recent nationwide municipal elections. The party's overall vote dropped by an
arithmetically small but politically significant 3%. It also lost control of an
important number of councils. The results may cost former finance minister
Alejandro Foxley his job as PDC chairman and a chance at a 1999 presidential
run.</P>
<P>The PDC has borne the brunt of the political wear and tear of governing
while the other two main coalition parties, the Socialist Party (PS) and the
Party for Democracy (PPD), have acted as an opposition within the government. As
such, they are often spared the cost of sometimes unpopular measures. But the
lower PDC vote also reflects the widespread belief that the party's mayors have
been involved in more than their fair share of corruption and inefficient
municipal management. </P>
<P><B>Time For A Change?</B> By increasing their share of votes and
representation on local councils, the coalition parties strengthened their hand
in the approaching Concertacion debate over the 1999 presidential candidate. The
PS and the PPD see no reason to accept a PDC candidate for the third time after
the successful campaigns of PDC presidents Aylwin and Frei. The left's candidate
is public works minister Ricardo Lagos, who holds a commanding lead in opinion
polls.</P>
<P><B>Rising Star From The Right.</B> Meanwhile, the municipal election raised
the profile of Joaquin Lavin, a prospective presidential candidate from the
right. Lavin is the incumbent mayor of Las Condes, one of the most important
municipalities in Santiago. As a member of the right-wing Independent Democratic
Union (UDI), Lavin was re-elected with 78% of the vote. His victory has put a
wrinkle in the presidential hopes of center-right candidate, Andres Allamand,
chairman of Renovacion Nacional (RN).</P>
<H2>Reserve Rule Slapped On DL600 Capital</H2>
<P>Foreign capital entering Chile under the country's DL600 foreign investment
statute may now be subject to a reserve requirement following a recent ruling by
the central bank. To avoid the requirement, investors will have to prove that
money coming into the country is for &quot;productive&quot; purposes, not for
financial speculation. The measure has been criticized by business but the
central bank says it is simply interpreting existing rules under the DL600
foreign investment statute.</P>
<P>In a parallel measure, the central bank lifted a similar requirement on
funds coming in under the alternative Chapter XIV regulations, providing that
their use is productive. Financing for capital increases in existing firms will
be exempt only if the increase corresponds to an expansion of productive
capacity.</P>
<P><B>30% On Hold.</B> The new reserve requirement, known as the &quot;encaje,&quot;
means that 30% of incoming funds must be deposited with the central bank for one
year without interest. The measure was first introduced in 1991 but DL600
financing has until now been exempt. The central bank describes the new ruling
as closing a loophole. Authorities claim too much speculative capital was coming
in through DL600, but have provided no figures.</P>
<P><B>Doubtful Efficacy.</B> Critics of the measure complain that it is not a
very efficient way to deter speculative capital and also makes nonsense of
Chile's aspirations of becoming a financial center in Latin America. The reserve
requirement is already the subject of a number of court cases. Unperturbed,
central bank president Carlos Massad maintains that removing the requirement
would expose the economy to fluctuations via the exchange rate. When the
financial system gains more breadth and depth, Massad says, the rule will no
longer be needed.</P>
<P><B>NAFTA Sticking Point.</B> The reserve requirement was a major stumbling
block in negotiations between Chile and Canada for a NAFTA-style trade
agreement. Canada has apparently conceded the point and the trade agreement is
expected to be completed shortly.</P>
<H3>SANTIAGO AIRPORT TO EXPAND</H3>
<P>With airline traffic booming, the government has announced a plan to triple
the capacity of the Santiago airport by the year 2000. The project will require
an investment of around $100 million with $20 million to upgrade cargo
facilities and $80 million for expanded passenger handling and an increase in
boarding gates from four to 14. The project will be open to the private sector
through the build-operate-transfer public works concessions pro gram.</P>
<P>Contracts for the passenger terminal and the freight  facility are expected
to be awarded next year. The ministry of public works will host an international
seminar to publicize the project on November 20 in Santiago.</P>
<P>One consortium has already been formed to place a bid. The group is made up
of the Airport Group International, Bechtel of San Francisco, the Odebrecht
construction company of Brazil, the local LanChile airline and a local bank. The
Enersis electricity group, which has a major real estate project close to the
airport, is also reportedly interested in forming a consortium.</P>
