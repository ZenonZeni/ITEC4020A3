</CENTER></H2>

<P>
Telesurgery is an area of considerable interest for medical companies
and clinicians.  The main driver of this interest is the need
to leverage the expertise of surgical specialists to facilitate
greater training and adoption of laparoscopic procedures.  The
major laparoscopic instrument makers have  made significant investments
in this area and have established tele-surgery networks where
two-way video and audio equipment connect surgical suites with
teaching facilities.
<P>
To date, telesurgery has consisted of two-way audio and video
communications allowing surgeons in the OR to consult with surgeons
at remote areas.  Robotic devices will allow surgeons to actively
participate in the surgery from a remote location.  AESOP is the
first step in that development, allowing the surgeon to actively
control the video picture. 
<P>
We have configured a system that can be easily integrated into
an existing tele-surgery communications network.
<P>
The AESOP TS Telesurgery System includes the following equipment:
<UL>
<LI>an AESOP system with communication card to be used in the
&quot;local&quot; OR
<LI>additional AESOP TS Controller, Hand Control and communications
card to be used at the &quot;remote&quot; site.
</UL>

<P>
The AESOP System can use the existing communications link to send
and receive commands or use its own dedicated modems for communication.
<P>
The AESOP TS System is <U><B>not</B></U> FDA cleared for use in
surgery.  Its applications at this point are in research only.
