&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As I arrived at breakfast one morning aboard the Coral Princess, sometime in the middle of the first Zegrahm Kimberley trip, Mike handed me a fax from the office with a note from Werner:  "While aboard, would you mind writing an article about your experiences in the Kimberley for the next newsletter?" With good intentions, I responded in the next fax that I would be happy to do so.  However, I soon realized that accomplishing this seemingly simple task was certainly not going to happen as long as I was exploring the Kimberley coast.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon after we sailed from Wyndham in early May, I realized this was not going to be a trip like any other.  There were no restful days at sea to enable us to "catch up."  In fact, there were no afternoons or mornings at sea - free time was as rare as clouds on the <IMG SRC="zoeexpl.gif" ALT="zoeexpl.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2>horizon.  I kept telling myself I would find the time tomorrow.  Needless to say, it never happened - not until after I disembarked in Broome.  So, as I sit here on a plane bound for home, after what has truly been a fantastic expedition, I have finally found the quiet time to write about a most incredible voyage.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like many people, a year ago I had never heard of the Kimberley.  A place called Broome?  I thought that is what you swept the kitchen with.  Darwin?  I thought he was a the man who came up with the theory of evolution, not a charming little town in Northern Australia.  As for crocodiles - I can honestly say that I was not in any hurry to come face to face with them.  Little did I know...<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first, one may think Australia is not a remote enough destination for someone interested in an "expedition.  However, the northwestern corner, known as the Kimberley, is one of the most remote, isolated and little known places in the world.  Very few people live here - less than 25,000 inhabitants in an area the size of Great Britain.  The majority of the residents are aboriginals, whose estimated 40,000 year history on this continent is depicted on countless rock overhangs and isolated cave walls which we seemed to stumble upon in the middle of nowhere.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a doubt, the most ominous and well known resident of this region has four legs, not two and is reminiscent of another age in our history.  The saltwater crocodile - a truly prehistoric looking creature - I found to be simply terrifying yet mysteriously captivating.  It is virtually impossible to believe that these reptiles grow as large as 8 meters in length, but as you see them slither silently through the water, their yellow eyes and scaled head barely breaking the surface, you immediately understand why the locals do not dare to swim in the murky waters close to shore.  At night as we patrolled aboard ZOE Explorer - our specially equipped 48 passenger excursion boat, built especially for these trips to cruise the shallow waters of otherwise inaccessible rivers - we were stopped cold by the "salties" eyes, which glow red as they rest motionlessly on the muddy river banks.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, not all residents of the Kimberley are this intimidating.  On one occasion, we marveled as a female green turtle slowly made her way across more than 100 meters of beautiful white sandy beach from the waters edge to the safety of higher ground, where she proceeded to dig a deep hole and lay her eggs with great determination.  Then, her task completed, she returned to the sea.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sea is the focal point of life in the Kimberley.  The enormous tides vary as much as 10 meters - the third largest in the world.  In the Kimberley, everything revolves around the ebbing and flowing tides.  At low tide, entire river beds dry up, mangroves are exposed to their tangled roots and mud flats come alive with mud skippers, crabs, and crocodiles.  When the water rises, the environment changes, as all forms of life who do not want to be submerged retreat to higher ground.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of my favorite stories from this voyage was the day we decided to have a barbecue on remote Albert Island.  The Captain agreed that this was a great idea, but cautioned that we had to be careful to return to the ship early because of the tides, which were particularly large in this area at this time of the month.  Not long after we were ashore, having set up all of our cooking gear, we began noticing that the tide was dropping much more quickly than we expected.  As a matter of fact, based on our well placed log/water markers, the tide was dropping about a meter every 15-20 minutes!  Soon the water’s edge was more than half a mile from our original landing site.  As darkness fell, it was closer to a mile!  Mike and I walked endlessly across the newly exposed beach, flashlight in hand, trying to discern exactly where the water’s edge was.  At one point a small turtle crossed our path, and Mike debated carrying it back up the beach to where we had built a campfire, to show the passengers.  It was still a long walk however, and the turtle was anxious to move on without us.  When we finally reached the water’s edge, the Coral Princess was only about 1 mile away, and we briefly considered wading back to the ship.  But passengers had settled in comfortably on the beach, singing songs by the fire and enjoying the balmy Australian evening, so we decided it was best to wait until the tide turned.  Fortunately, the tide returned as quickly as it had receded and by 2300 we were all back on board (the BBQ equipment, too!) after a truly amazing day.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are so many things that make Australia’s Kimberley a unique destination.  Perhaps the unofficial national motto - "No Worries" - sums it all up.  This catchall phrase describes life in the land of "Aus."  The people are friendly, accommodating and amenable and fortunately this warm, laid back feeling is immediately contagious.  Before I knew it, I was calling everyone I met "mate" and by the end, I did finally realize which side of the car to get in to as a passenger (they kept wondering why I was trying to drive their cars!)<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rarely explored Kimberley region is a land of untold hidden secrets.  The rich history and spectacular scenery make it an excellent destination of discovery.  It would take years to explore it all - but what a pleasure just to scratch the surface!

<I> Werner’s note:  As many of you know, Lisa has for years been the undisputed Polar Queen, preferring the cooler weather of these regions to our more equatorial destinations.  Although she was looking forward to accompanying two of our 1996 Australian expeditions, she was a bit hesitant about the very warm temperatures, which are in the 80’s during the time of our voyages.  However, I was not surprised when she came back full of enthusiasm, wanting to return next year!</I>
