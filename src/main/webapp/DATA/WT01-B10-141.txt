<H2>The Dennis G. Shepherd Memorial Teaching Prize</H2>
<BR>
Professor Shepherd, who died January 1994, was a noted expert and teacher
of fluids engineering and turbomachinery. His early career was spent with
Sir Frank Whittle and the team that developed the first jet aircraft for
the Allies during WWII. Shep came to Cornell in 1948 and was a major influence
on the education of Cornell engineering students for four decades. He continued
active teaching until 1988, well past the date of his nominal retirement.
After his death a prize was established in his memory through the generous
gifts of his family, friends, the faculty and staff of the School and numerous
alumni. This year, Professor Charles H. K. Williamson, noted for his outstanding
and enthusiastic teaching style, was chosen as the first recipient of the
Dennis G. Shepherd Memorial Teaching Prize. <BR>
