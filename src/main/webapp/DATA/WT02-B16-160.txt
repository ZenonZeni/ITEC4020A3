        <td valign="top" width="640">Interested in having your
        software tool included in the directory? <p>We are
        looking for software for improving energy efficiency or
        incorporating renewable energy concepts in buildings. The
        software must be available--no vaporware--either directly
        downloadable or for purchase. Tools intended primarily
        for research users are ok if they are available and well documented.
        Commercial software is also welcome--no ads please. We
        intend the directory to act as an impartial clearinghouse
        -- providing consistent information about a broad variety
        of building software available worldwide. </p>
        <p>The information we need for the directory is shown at
        the end of this message--a good example from the
        directory is the <a href="blast.htm">BLAST</a> energy
        simulation program.</p>
        <p>How best to get information on your software to us? We
        prefer that you e-mail the information as text in a
        message. <em>Attach electronic versions of logos or
        screen captures to the message. We really want and need
        graphics!</em> Simple screen captures are fine. Do not
        worry about formatting the information or the graphics.
        We can convert most common formats. When you send us
        information on your software, include the category where
        your software fits best and a list of five keywords that
        describe what it does.</p>
        <p>Once we get the information, we will evaluate it to
        ensure it is complete, consistent, and not too much of an
        ad for your software. We will then format it and put it
        up on the web page. Yes, it is that easy. Generally it
        takes less than a couple of days.</p>
        <p>I hope that you will be interested in having your
        software in the directory. If you have questions or would
        like to recommend other software for the directory,
        please contact me.</p>
