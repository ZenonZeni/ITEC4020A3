LONDON ONLINE SHOW ATTRACTS RECORD CROWD

     by Tom Hogan

     [Editor's Note: "Information Today" Publisher Tom Hogan was in London
last month at Learned Information Europe Ltd.'s Online Information 95 meeting,
so we asked him at deadline to prepare this quick report. Next month, in his
first "European Report" column for "IT," U.K.-based information industry
writer-editor Richard Poynder will cover the conference in depth.]

     The Online Information 95 exhibition, held in London December 5-7,
attracted a total of 16,870 visitors, clearly establishing this event as the
largest electronic information meeting in the world. The meeting, formerly
known as the International Online Information Meeting or IOLIM, celebrated its
19th anniversary this year with an attendance growth of some 35 percent.

     "The widespread media coverage of the Internet has brought our industry
into the limelight," said Jill Cousins, director of marketing for Learned
Information Europe Ltd., sponsor of the meeting. "In fact, however, we have
been promoting the use of electronic information for the last 20 years. The
substantial increase in the number of visitors at this year's meeting reflects
the growing recognition of the importance of electronic information services
for general business and scientific use."

     The exhibition, held at the Olympia 2 conference and exhibition center,
housed 346 exhibitors and featured a special Internet floor under the banner
of "Internet World International Winter 95." Learned Information Europe Ltd.
will hold its main Internet conference, Internet World International 96, on
May 21-23, also in London.

     On the conference side, slightly over 1,000 attendees listened to
presentations as varied as "Online Pricing: Changing Strategies in a Changing
World" to "Assessing the Impact of the Internet and Online Services on
Traditional Publish-ers" to "Peace and Information in the Middle East."

     The complete 612-page proceedings of the conference can be purchased in
North America from Information Today, Inc., 800/300-9868.

     [Tom Hogan is the publisher of "Information Today."]

COMPUTER SECURITY SURVEY: FINANCIAL LOSSES AND INTERNET BREAK-INS

     In addition to the problems of hackers, ex-employees, and unscrupulous
competitors, increased use of the Internet for business purposes is a growing
concern for information security professionals, according to the Third Annual
Ernst & Young/InformationWeek Information Security Survey.

     More than half of those surveyed reported security-related financial
losses in the past year--with 20 companies reporting losses in excess of $1
million. And of those using the Internet for exchanging information
externally, 20 percent reported successful or attempted break-ins in the past
year.

     Forty percent of the Internet business users expressed dissatisfaction
with Internet security, the survey found. At the same time, a commanding 87
percent of Internet users stated that they would use it more for business
purposes if security were enhanced. More than two-thirds of those not using
the Internet now, but planning to within a year, said they would increase
their potential use even more if its security were improved.

     Most companies surveyed admit that they do not have adequate tools or
properly trained personnel to defend against information security losses,
which can run into millions of dollars. But Daniel E. White, an Ernst & Young
partner specializing in information security, points out, "Companies are
demonstrating growing awareness of security problems and increased willingness
to devote additional resources to their solution."

     "Information security should be decentralized," said White. "As companies
rely on advanced information technology to exchange data among remote
locations such as plants, branch offices, and warehouses, effective security
systems need to be implemented in those locations, and the people in charge
locally must regard information security as part of their responsibility. To
assist in this effort, common guidelines for security must be developed
centrally and uniformly enforced at all locations."

     The report, which surveyed 1,300 chief information officers (CIOs) and
other senior information executives, looked at a wide array of other security
issues, ranging from problems of "telecommuting" employees with remote access
to a company's systems to the importance of being placed on security in new
client/server environments.

     Other key survey findings are:

     --   More than two-thirds of respondents surveyed reported encountering
          a virus in the past year.

     --   A lack of proven security tools/solutions is a major obstacle to
          good information security.

     --   A notable increase was reported in the number of security heads who
          report to the CIO (43 percent in 1995, 32 percent in 1994, and 27
          percent in 1993).

     "Our survey results over the past three years show that information
security issues are becoming better understood. And the increased awareness
that management is putting on computer security is very encouraging--budgets
are increasing, more tools are being implemented, and security professionals
are becoming more involved in the systems development process," White said.

     The survey also reports that nearly half the companies surveyed have
ongoing information security awareness programs, although fewer companies have
such programs as part of the orientation process for new employees. More than
three-fourths have a formal corporate information/data security policy.

     For more information or a copy of the survey, contact Bernard Wedge of
Ernst & Young LLP, 216/861-8884; e-mail: bernard.wedge@ey.com.

CADMUS DEBUTS JOURNALS.AT-HOME, TEAMS WITH UNCOVER CO. FOR DOCUMENT DELIVERY

     Cadmus Digital Solutions (CDS) has established JOURNALS.At-HOME
(http://journals.at-home.com) on the Internet's World Wide Web with the
electronic debut of 18 prestigious scientific and medical journals.
JOURNALS.At-HOME debuted last October with table of contents and abstracts for
the October issues of "Stroke," "Circulation" (twice monthly), "Circulation
Research," "Hypertension," and "Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular
Biology," published by the American Heart Association; "The American Journal
of Pathology" published by the American Society for Investigative Pathology;
and the "Journal of Immunology." In addition, complete articles in "The
Cutting Edge," a section of the "Journal of Immunology" and table of contents
for 11 journals published by the American Society of Microbiology went online.
Subsequent issues go online simultaneously with the mailing of printed
catalogs.

     Journals, electronic catalogs, and databases residing on JOURNALS.At-HOME
are linked externally to other sites and will soon be linked internally as
well, to meet the growing interactive and communications needs of scientists,
physicians, engineers, researchers, scholars, librarians, and teachers,
according to Cadmus. JOURNALS.At-HOME offers an evolutionary approach whereby
publishers can initially go online with table of contents and then add content
gradually. The content opportunities can include complete articles, letters to
the editor, images, editorial board profiles, subscription ordering, product
literature, online catalogs, and more.

     "With JOURNALS.At-HOME, we have created a single collaborative space
where the objectives of publishers, end users, and advertisers can all be
met," said Frederick Bowes, president, Cadmus Digital Solutions, and creator
of JOURNALS.At-HOME. "Helping content owners generate new revenues from their
online services is an important component of Cadmus Digital Solutions'
publisher-oriented approach."

CADMUS/UNCOVER PARTNERSHIP

     Cadmus also recently announced a strategic partnership with The UnCover
Company to provide online document delivery service within JOURNALS.At-HOME.
The UnCover Company provides a comprehensive, multidisciplinary database
containing over seven million article citations, indexing nearly 17,000
journals worldwide. JOURNALS.At-HOME will begin offering document delivery
service early this year.

     Without leaving the JOURNALS.At-HOME service and depending on each
publisher's configuration, researchers, educators, and professionals will have
the opportunity to quickly access complete articles from a journal's table of
contents, or abstracts residing in JOURNALS.At-HOME, and complete articles
cited and back issues of journals residing in the service. Users will generate
online orders directly with The UnCover Company and receive printed articles
within 24 hours via fax.

     "Through our collaboration with The UnCover Company, an industry leader
in the field of document delivery, CDS now has the ability to meet the
objectives of both end users and publishers," said Bowes.

     "Those seeking cutting-edge research can quickly and conveniently access
quality resource materials, saving valuable time. Publishers benefit by making
it easy for users to obtain legal copies."

     The UnCover Company and its parent company, The CARL Corporation, a
leading provider of library automation services, are owned by Knight-Ridder
Information, Inc.

     Cadmus Digital Solutions is part of Cadmus Journal Services, a producer
of scientific, technical, medical, and scholarly journals. Cadmus Digital
Solutions offers Internet publishing and content management services along
with new media products to professional and scholarly publishers, including
the more than 400 highly specialized journals already produced by Cadmus.

SEVEN DATABASES TO ADOPT OVID INTERFACE

     Ovid Technologies has announced that three Cambridge Scientific Abstracts
databases--Cambridge Life Sciences Collection, Cambridge Aquatic Sciences &
Fisheries Abstracts, and Cambridge Environmental Science & Pollution
Management are being implemented with Ovid software, to appear on CD-ROM,
networks, and online. Additionally, Ovid plans to create electronic
implementations of four academic databases--Bowker's Books in Print, the MLA
International Bibliography, PAIS International, and Sociofile. Each will be
equipped with Ovid software.

CAMBRIDGE DATABASES

     Cambridge Life Sciences Collection covers the international literature of
over 21 separate life science disciplines, including cell and molecular
biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, biotechnology, entomology, ecology,
immunology, microbiology, genetics, agriculture, and veterinary science. The
database is derived from 22 journals which abstract and index 6,500 worldwide
publications.

     Cambridge Aquatic Sciences & Fisheries Abstracts is the leading database
in aquatics science, produced in collaboration with four UN agencies and a
network of national research centers. Coverage includes developments in the
science, technology, and management of marine, freshwater, and brackishwater
environments and organisms.

     Cambridge Environmental Science & Pollution Management covers relevant
fields across the environmental sciences, monitoring 1,500 primary journals,
monographs, and conference proceedings and providing selective coverage of
5,500 secondary sources. The database is drawn from the primary sources for 11
abstracts journals. It covers the ecosystem and all forms of pollution,
including air, marine, and freshwater pollution; environmental engineering,
toxic hazards of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other substances; biochemical
applications in water treatment and pollution; and more.

     Ovid's implementations of all three databases will include special Ovid
features. Among these are Pull-Down Search Menus, combining field-specific
text descriptions with easy searching of all fields; Database-Specific Limits,
allowing users to restrict more precisely the result of a search to predefined
criteria, such as language, document type, and publication year; and Advanced
Output Configuration, permitting searchers to define the fields to be viewed,
printed, or saved.

ACADEMIC DATABASES

     Produced by the Modern Language Association of America, The MLA
International Bibliography indexes critical scholarship on literature,
language, linguistics, and folklore. The bibliography provides expansive
coverage of national literatures in more than 100 languages, as well as
linguistic research and analysis of every language family and group; it
contains entries for journal articles, series, monographs, dissertations,
bibliographies, proceedings, and other materials. In all, the bibliography
indexes more than 3,500 publications.

     The MLA International Bibliography on Ovid will incorporate the print
bibliographies since 1963 and will include more than 1.2 million records. Ovid
will offer the MLA thesaurus as a convenient pull-down tool, allowing
first-time users to employ the same concise vocabulary as experienced
searchers. A pull-down permuted index and a classification hierarchy will
further enhance advanced search techniques. Familiar Ovid features such as
on-screen search tips, database-specific limits, and configurable output will
make the bibliography exceptionally easy to use. The MLA International
Bibliography on Ovid will soon be available for networks and for fixed-fee and
pay-as-you-go online access. The database will be updated 10 times a year.

     Produced by Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), the PAIS
International database is a bibliographic index with abstracts covering the
full range of political, social, and  public policy issues. Coverage includes
documents published worldwide in any of six languages: English, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. The index headings and abstracts are
in English. Topics covered include economic, political, and social issues;
business; finance; law; international trade and relations; public
administration; government; political science; and any topics that are or
might become the subject of legislation. The database covers selected journal
articles, books, statistics, yearbooks, directories, conference, proceedings,
pamphlets, reports, government documents, and microfiche. More than 1,600
journals and over 8,000 monographs are indexed each year.

     PAIS International on Ovid will be available for stand-alone, network,
and online searching. Implementation features will include a Thesaurus and
Database-Specific Limits.

     PAIS International on Ovid will also include Configurable Output Options,
allowing users to define the fields that they view, print, and save.

     Bowker's Books In Print on Ovid will be available for stand-alone and
network searching and is already available via Ovid Online. Special Ovid
features will include Separate Records for each instance of a book title, an
Author Field that indexes an author's name and role (e.g, editor or
illustrator), and a Database-Specific Limits Menu that allows users to narrow
their searches without memorizing complex search codes.

     Produced by Sociological Abstracts, Inc., Sociofile is the leading
research database in the field of sociology and related social sciences,
including anthropology, economics, education, social work, and social policy
and development. The file provides abstracts from more than 2,400 core and
discipline-related serials (1974-present) published worldwide and enhanced
bibliographic citations of relevant entries from Dissertation Abstracts
International (1986-present).

     An Ovid implementation of Sociological Abstracts, the parent database of
Sociofile, is currently available online, and Sociofile will soon be available
for CD-ROM stand-alones and networks, as well as online. Ovid's version
features Automatic Natural Language Mapping to Sociofile's subject headings,
Database-Specific Limits, and a full Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms.

NEWSWIRE ASAP RELOADED ON DIALOG WITH PREDICASTS PRODUCT CODES

     Information Access Company (IAC) has announced that IAC Newswire ASAP
(File 649) has been reloaded on DIALOG with Predicasts Product Codes to
enhance searching capabilities. Also, as part of the Newswire ASAP reload, the
file is now available to non-North American searchers.

     Newswire ASAP provides the full text of wire stories from key worldwide
news sources. Among the wire services currently covered are Business Wire,
Newsbytes, and PR Newswire. It becomes the sixth IAC database on DIALOG to be
reloaded and standardized with DIALOG's uniform fields this year. Uniform
field tags facilitate cross-file searching across the entire DIALOG system.

     Newswire ASAP offers both current and retrospective information on
companies, industries, products, people, trends, and technologies. It provides
historical perspective and current awareness on worldwide events, helpful for
tracking global political and economic news, conducting competitive
intelligence, and monitoring worldwide industry and technology.

     The complete text and indexing of wire stories are usually available for
searching within 36 hours of transmission, according to IAC. All words within
the text are searchable, facilitating searches for quotes, figures, or any
mention of a company name or personal name found in the text. Controlled
vocabulary searching may be used to limit searches to substantive stories
about specific companies, industries, products, people, or events.

     In addition to the standardization, a significant enhancement to topical
searching is now available in Newswire ASAP with the addition of Predicasts
Product Codes. Predicasts Product Codes provide a hierarchical numerical
coding system that enables online searches to focus as broadly or narrowly as
required. Predicasts Product Codes, which include over 21,000 unique codes,
are also available on IAC Promt and IAC Trade and Industry Database, and other
IAC databases. The addition of this coding system enables users to combine
other Predicasts-coded IAC business databases using DIALOG OneSearch.

WILL TODAY'S DATABASES SURVIVE? A QUESTION OF VALUE

     by Leonard M. Fuld

     [Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of three articles by
publishing consultant and writer Leonard Fuld addressing the future of online
databases and the changing information climate. His two subsequent articles
will run in the February and March issues of "IT."]

     The information Ice Age is here. The Internet has opened the information
seeker's mind. Yet, at the same time, it may have begun the Ice Age for
traditional databases. As found on the Internet, information has become cheap
to get and relatively easy to find. Not that the data is necessarily high
quality or even timely; it's just that it's low in cost and may actually meet
the average person's needs. Practically overnight, large numbers of folks who
are not info-junkies or trained information professionals have discovered
electronic information. The big question facing the database producers now is:
"What do we do for an encore?"

     Database publishers should take a lesson from rock-and-roll bands. Like
rock bands, databases have seen evolutionary change: creation, extinction,
absorption, and even enhancement. I remember seeing a family tree of sorts
that tracked the path that rock-and-roll has taken, where particular musicians
have gone, what band they joined, and where they moved next. Databases have
followed a similar course of development. The ones that did not meet a need
died. Those that did meet a need either grew or were merged into larger data
pools.

     Database historians looking back at the late 1990s will likely point to
this period as one of meteoric change. They will indeed have a great deal of
material from which to draw their conclusions. Just examine today's electronic
publishing headlines:

     --   Low cost + sophistication: InfoSeek, an inexpensive Internet search
service, is accessed over 1 million times a day and processes over 500,000
full-text inquiries. The basic monthly subscription charge is $9.95, with
relatively modest search fees for some special services it offers. InfoSeek
Search includes such databases as Associated Press Online, Reuters Business
Report, Commerce Business Daily, and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. The
service even offers customers the ability to create relatively sophisticated
information filters. These filters will help customers limit the amount of
information they need to see. Has InfoSeek laid down the gauntlet to DIALOG
and LEXIS-NEXIS? You bet. Is this cheap, low-quality information? No, just
reasonable information, inexpensively obtained.

     --   "Have it your way," two lines of attack: PR Newswire, a database
containing corporate press releases from many (but a limited number) of U.S.
corporations, leapfrogged traditional database delivery systems. You can now
tap into PR Newswire directly through the Internet, or you can phone an
automated faxback system. By calling a special number and following the menu
directions, you can order one or a series of press releases--all at no charge
to the caller. Use the phone pad or the keyboard; it makes no difference to PR
Newswire. Either way, you get the data.

     --   Volume discounts: CD-ROMs are making online access to directories
almost obsolete. Why pay thousands of dollars to access countless names online
when you can buy a series of discs that hold over 80 million names, addresses,
and telephone numbers for approximately $100?

     Instead of heeding these warning signals and racing to upgrade their
products or the means to deliver their products, many publishers and database
distributors have merely taken baby steps. Some have decided that growth
through acquisition of other databases is the way to fend off competition.
Others have improved their front-end search engine--or at least its
appearance. Is bigger necessarily better? Is prettier better than smarter?
These are questions demanding answers.

     To a certain extent, the larger and richer the database the more valuable
it becomes--up to a point. Big databases take more maintenance and become
difficult to tailor and enhance. Adding fields or features becomes a complex
task, as the data itself has become less uniform, more diverse than its
smaller predecessor. It is very possible future publishers will look back 10
or 20 years from now and view behemoth databases as data dinosaurs, not
malleable or user friendly.

     The survivors, the entities that will actually thrive, will do so because
they have adapted to the new information environment. In this environment,
there will be two classes of databases: those that are low priced, offering
little added value to the user, and those that charge a premium for
specialized data that have been--or can be--massaged.

     The low-priced databases will be forced to practically give away their
files and their data. These database publishers can expect slim margins. Their
users can expect rudimentary results and will not pay a high price for what
they receive. In contrast, the high-priced databases will deliver high-quality
results, not just data. Publishers of such databases will need to maintain the
infrastructure to retain the quality and to constantly add enhancements.

     Most of today's database publishers operate in the high-priced arena and
presumably would like to stay there. All this costs. They have built expensive
support, communications, and data processing facilities. I include the IAC,
Chemical Abstracts, and Derwent databases in this group. Yet the Internet is
forcing the price per unit of raw data down to extremely low levels. The
average consumer, even the corporate librarian pressed by a tight budget,
would rather choose the free alternative than the fee-based one.

     Plummeting database prices have already begun to squeeze the profits out
of the bottom line. Without the margins to support the existing business, the
traditional database publishing infrastructure itself may erode. The result
may be the bankruptcy of certain databases. This would be a loss to both the
publishers and to the public.

ACCESS, ACCURACY, AND ADDED VALUE

     If today's database publishers want to thrive in years ahead, they must
enhance offerings to their information-savvy public by dramatically improving
their product quality. The quality issue goes far beyond spell-checking or
indexing. It goes to the core of the product itself. Future database quality
will be measured by three criteria: access, accuracy, and added value.

     Access refers to the ease of entry into the system and to the data
itself. The more the user has access to the knowledge embedded within a
database, the more useful and user-friendly that database becomes. In
contrast, the greater the black box effect, the less the user will want to
use--or to pay--for that source. For instance, if a searcher needed to find
information on local area networks but just plugged in the term LAN, would the
database find all related terms and technologies? Right now, the answer is hit
or miss. The skilled searcher may know to look for all synonyms, but the
professor, salesperson, purchasing manager, or executive, who is frequently
the ultimate user, may not. Future database publishers will have to cater to
this group of decision-makers; besides, economics will dictate that databases
migrate to this broader population and further away from the librarian who is
often the database gatekeeper. These decision-makers want answers, not merely
data; the services that can most easily provide them with answers will win.

     In the future, access will mean that, despite the fact that searchers may
not have known all the relationships and technical synonyms, they will easily
find the complete answer. And if they can't find it in the high-priced
databases, then they will naturally select the low-priced database
alternatives, despite all the deficiencies and inconveniences they represent.
Even today, if PR Newswire offers some of the news (albeit biased), why should
the cost-conscious manager go to Information Access Corporation's PROMT or to
the Dow Jones or Reuters news services? PR Newswire's content may be biased
and somewhat unstructured, but it's also inexpensive and easy to find. For the
harried manager who just wants information, it may suffice.

     Accuracy is the second criterion and perhaps conceptually the easiest for
today's publishers to meet. Databases filled with errors or poor abstracting
will suffer alongside the more accurate ones. At the same time, error-prone
databases or those lacking specificity will lose against even poorly managed
Internet Usenet groups or Internet-available databases. After all, where is
the benefit in the consumer's eyes? Why pay for only partial or inaccurate
data, when you can get the equivalent for a lot less money?

     Unfortunately, accuracy, while important, remains the least visible of
the three criteria. Typographical errors aside, other types of errors are
elusive, only caught by a few. Once again, the busy manager or academic may
miss the inaccuracies, casting a longer glance at the final bill.

MORE INSIGHT, LESS DATA

     Finally, added value represents the greatest threat--and opportunity--to
database publishers in the 1990s. Database publishers are currently spending
great amounts of money on adding content to their information pool, without
doing much to enhance its value in the eyes of business decision makers (a
large part of the market). Decision makers want fewer, more focused
findings--not more data in the form of paper. Database producers need to add
this value. They need to create information summaries, or maps of the data,
anything that will help the consumer answer questions earlier and more
perceptively. Instead of receiving endless printouts, decision makers want
summaries that will help point them in the right direction. Users want these
systems to identify trends, and to winnow out the valuable from the valueless.
Users, in short, want insight, not just more data.

     Business managers want to receive early warnings of market shifts or a
competitor's new product development. They do not want to read more history
and countless articles repeating the same message over and over again. The
ultimate customers are willing to pay a premium for time-saving notices.

     Many of today's better-constructed databases already have the built-in
structure, the indexing, to offer their users a better end product. In
particular, I am thinking of the Derwent patent databases, Chemical Abstracts,
and the Predicast/IAC series with their specific product and event codes.
These and others like them contain embedded coding that should help these
publishers further enhance their end products' value. Give me a cluster
analysis of patents to help me determine a competitor's technology strategy,
or provide me with signs that a competitor may be changing its target market.
This is added value. In certain cases, third-party vendors offer some of these
solutions today. However, the publishers themselves need to offer these
products. They know their products best and would benefit the most from an
improved, more user-friendly deliverable.

     Either the publishers need to enhance the way they store the data, or
they need to work with concerns that can enhance the front end, the means to
massage the existing data. The more automated a database publisher can make
the product, the more data the user will need. It's a win-win situation for
everyone: the decision-maker as well as the publisher.

     Today's lack of added value has become the greatest barrier--a knowledge
barrier--for the online database world. I know many corporate executives who
refuse to examine the database printouts their library sends them simply
because the volume is too great, or the information gems are too difficult to
identify. The searchers themselves are often at a loss as to how to present
the data in a more sophisticated form. Hence, insights that the database
search could yield never surface. Critical knowledge is missed.

     Currently, the database industry apparently thinks it is delivering
value-added business information--at least as far as the advertisements read.
"Competitive intelligence" and "business intelligence" crop up in the database
press all the time. By and large, database publishers and the systems they use
to distribute the data do little more than group or compile it like pieces of
information. I have seen few products that truly analyze or even save the user
a great deal of time.

     True, publishers have found ways to pool data into blocks of information,
but they have failed to add enough value, to turn this information into
decision-producing intelligence. The information consumer realizes this. The
database community should be warned of the axiom: "Nothing kills a bad product
faster than good advertising." Publishers need to dramatically improve their
value-added offerings or suffer the consequences of dwindling usage.

     Publishers must learn how to mine the value inherent in their products.
Those that do will continue to command the value/price high ground. Their
customers will be equally happy with the improved, time-saving,
decision-producing results they receive.

     Whether or not the database world realizes it, its environment has
already begun to change. With an increasing number of sophisticated electronic
competitors entering this new world, the competitive climate is growing
harsher. The publishers and distributors that survive will be the ones who
recognize and act on this changing information climate.

Competitor Intelligence" (John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1995).]

WHAT'S AHEAD FOR 1996?

     Once again "Information Today" is starting off a new year with some
forward thinking by presenting the predictions of a number of executives
selected from varied segments of the information industry. We asked them to
tell us what they foresee developing in the industry and at their companies
during 1996 and beyond.

     Here's a look into the future of one of the most exciting, most
important, and most rapidly evolving industries--one that is taking the world
in new directions. Let's see where some of our industry leaders think we're
headed.

     Morris Goldstein
     Chief Executive Officer
     Information Access Company

     If 1995 was the year of Internet access, then 1996 is the year of the
World Wide Web. It is the beginning of an era in which content, computing, and
telecommunications converge, altering the world's business landscape as we
know it today.

     The center of activity in the computing world will shift from a
client/server platform to the World Wide Web. Large software players (such as
Microsoft, IBM/Lotus, and Oracle), as well as major online services (America
Online, CompuServe, and Microsoft Network, to name a few), will make the Web
environment their number one priority for software and service development.

     As part of this shift, we will see the emergence of groupware
capabilities for the Web, greater ease of use, expanded functionality, and a
dramatic acceleration of information usage among novice end users and
information professionals. In parallel, new publishing ventures will exploit
the commercial potential of the Web by developing low-cost, multimedia
alternatives to traditional print and electronic media, thus helping to expand
the information industry's financial model from a usage-supported paradigm to
one that is partially advertising supported.

     In a related development, specialty services such as executive
recruitment, travel, real estate, financial services, and insurance brokerages
will expand their Web-based offerings, enabling their customers to easily
locate business and leisure opportunities, weigh options, and make competitive
price comparisons.

     As corporations de-emphasize restructuring and reengineering to
concentrate on "top line growth" in order to command leadership positions in
their markets, 1996 will witness center stage growth in the areas of knowledge
creation and ongoing knowledge management. At the core of this opportunity
will be the corporate information specialist, whose expertise in monitoring
the external marketplace and creating actionable knowledge will be critical to
the successful outcome of daily corporate decision making. Companies that are
tuned into the dynamic nature of this process will commit budget funds to the
creation and management of knowledge as a means of stimulating innovation and
revenue growth.

     At the same time, public and academic libraries will develop as the
preferred electronic information "hubs" for their communities and continue to
improve their services by offering remote access to patrons who wish to
utilize the Internet and other electronic services from their dorm rooms,
faculty offices, and homes. For this reason, many libraries will make
significant investments to support access to services that require intelligent
workstations.

     During a period of accelerating paradigm shifts, it's unlikely that the
information industry and even the concept of databases will remain status quo
 . . . but that's a good topic for next year's predictions!


     Steve Arnold
     President
     Arnold Information Technology

     A new medium has been invented in the last 12 months. "Internet" is the
word applied to a cluster of technologies that is blending and breeding at a
very fast rate. A normal publishing year has 12 months; the Internet year has
three months. No one doubts that for the electronic information community,
there are both opportunities and challenges.

     Over the next 12 months, five forces (what I call "vectors") will gain
momentum. The first is rising cost and competitive pressure in traditional
information companies. Particularly stressed will be those firms in legal,
scientific-technical, and professional publishing. The old models are
evolving, and authors are going direct to readers. Governments can no longer
afford to print paper copies of their prodigious output. The Internet is less
costly and does not kill trees.

     Second, the Internet makes available a delivery and content platform that
allows customers to experience information, not just read it. New businesses
will flourish in response to keen customer demand for old information in new
packages. The game model is replacing the reference book model.

     Third, the traditional database world is in the process of transforming
itself from text to a multiobject format. The result is a new syntax and
rhetoric packaged in compound complex digital documents (C2D2). Why just read
about an experiment when one can see it take place and examine the data sets
it generated.

     Fourth, the era of intelligent text processing and agents that perform
value-adding functions once associated with human workers will become part of
the desktop. New online companies will exploit these technologies
aggressively, meeting little or no resistance from established online "brand"
names. There are not enough human indexers or money to pay them. Software is
fast and comparatively economical.

     Fifth, the pace of change will enable the technologically adept and
disable the technologically inept. Companies that refuse to embrace the new
medium will fall far back in the competitive pack.

     The opportunities are unparalleled in the history of communications, not
just electronic publishing. For many firms and individuals, the challenges
have never been greater. One thing is crystal clear--once these vectors of
change have been let loose, they will be difficult to control.


     John J. Regazzi
     President and CEO
     Engineering Information Inc.

     Lately I find myself tossing off a phrase that I believe so well
describes the world today and especially the current nature of the information
industry. I wish I could attribute it to its proper source: "The future," it
goes, "isn't what it used to be."

     It seems a day doesn't go by without at least one article or news story
on the Internet. Whether the story concerns virtual reality programs from PARC
or the confluence of video, audio, and text via computer in the home, or just
old fashioned get-rich-quick scams in cyberspace, news stories abound. And why
not? Once communication lines were opened, the rush to gain knowledge, to
exchange information instantaneously, or just to send some informal messages
to colleagues was unstoppable.

     Dealing with this momentum of information exchange will color all of
1996. The scientific and technical information community, of which I am a
part, will embrace new credos in each of its sectors. Authors will find new
channels of scientific communication; primary publishers will digitize and
disseminate or die; secondary services, perhaps most vulnerable, will need to
rediscover how to link reader and writer by some other means than abstracts
and indexes; libraries will be forced to find a means of controlling
technology, lest they are eroded from within; and readers and researchers will
discover that the systems' "walls of silence" have come down, but that there
are no instant answers in this new digital world. In short, not what it used
to be.

     The year 1996 will also mark, I believe, a landmark, because of the
current breadth and pace of change in the information industry. Soon
researchers and managers will be able to roam the world seeking information
independent of time and space. Whether in an airplane over London or on a
commuter train outside Chicago, you'll be able to send a voice mail message,
a paper copy, or even a video image to your office in New York or Tokyo with
a simple effort. A wider variety of files will be available online and
digitally 24 hours a day, accessible anywhere in the world. The freedom and
breadth of universal access may be the most significant benefits of the new
communication and information technologies of our age. Access, retrieval, and
display technologies will dwarf the capabilities of today, making the fax
machine seem as quaint as the manual typewriter.

     The final shift in this new information world--the shift of
leadership--will be initiated in 1996. Information production and
dissemination, once a labor-intensive task, is fast becoming a process
involving two parts. The production of knowledge will be open to many, as
technology lowers the barriers of entry to the traditional publishing
business. Dissemination, however, will be a capital-intensive business,
reserved for the few who can afford to support global, nonstop markets. The
traditional mainstays of the scientific and technical information
infrastructure--the technical societies, governments, the not-for-profit
associations--will be greatly disadvantaged in this capital-hungry enterprise
and will yield their leadership positions to the multinational, publicly held,
global communications companies now emerging.

     The year 1996 will mark the passing of these and other mantles, and after
that . . . well, you know, the future is not what it used to be.


     Bela Hatvani
     President
     SilverPlatter Information, Inc.

     The year 1996 will see an impressive growth in electronic publishing and
distribution. We are encouraging and, more importantly, facilitating this
growth through our ERL Technology. With ERL, we are not only broadening the
possibilities for access to electronic information, but we are enabling
partners to publish their own ERL-compliant documents through our Partner
Publishing Program. We will expand this program dramatically in 1996, enabling
publishers throughout the world to bring up their own publications in
ERL-compliant form.

     We will continue to work with our partners by equipping them with the
tools that will enable them to create an ordered Worldwide Digital Library on
the Internet. Our program for document management will link the magnificent
compendiums of bibliographic reference files that we distribute for over 100
major information providers to full-text documents in a methodical way through
the Internet, through direct dial to document sources, through fax, and
through other methods.

     We will come out with beta releases of the World Integrated Library of
Documents (WILD thing). This project is focused on creating pieces of
interoperating digital library technology that will enable our collaborating
partners to co-create with SilverPlatter the first of many embryonic and
interconnected digital libraries, which will exploit our base information
store and which will also allow publishers and technology providers to extend
this base.

     We will continue to serve our library and end-user customers with
hassle-free products and services. We will be releasing the Search Advisor,
which enables information intermediaries to put their search strategies into
scripts to allow end users to ask simple questions from a simple interface and
get accurate results.

     This industry is just beginning. We are about to see a sustained
explosion that will continue to grow the industry in a creative and chaotic
way. It is an exciting time for all involved.


     Deborah M. Hull
     Chief Operating Officer
     Ovid Technologies, Inc.

     The year 1995 saw the proliferation of a powerful new model for
information retrieval--the World Wide Web. In spite of its drawbacks, it has
captured the popular imagination in a way that no technology has done since
the introduction of the PC. Just as the PC ultimately transformed the working
world even without living up to its touted potential in the home, the Web will
change forever the way that information retrieval is perceived. As a
distributed, client/server model that is easy to use and develop, the Web
makes manifest that information retrieval is for anyone, that it cannot be
contained within one collection or product, and that adherence to standards
can bring a certain unity and presence to what has previously been a
staggering variety of products for specialized audiences. The many, and even
serious, information retrieval problems of the Web will not put this genie
back in the bottle.

     At Ovid Technologies, we have already been fully committed to standards
in our products, including Z39.50, SGML, and the NISO Thesaurus. We are
embracing not just the Web but the information retrieval model it implies. Our
client/server system architecture and all our products are designed for
maximum flexibility in fitting into existing environments--locally at a
research site or remotely via our online service. More importantly, we have
built a rich infrastructure for linkages from our databases to other database
products; to local OPAC holdings via Z39.50; to expanded product views via
internal Ovid links (for example, linking all the articles from one issue into
a table of contents or linking a document to one similar to it); and to other
services via URLs. An increasingly important linkage for us is to full text
from bibliographic records; between the various structural elements of full
text; or between cited references and full text. We see our growing full-text
collections as increasingly important in the "post-Web" world, where the end
result of a search is naturally expected to be a document rather than a
citation.

     Although in 1996 many companies will be scrambling to make products and
services on the Web, those of us already in the information retrieval business
will do well to think creatively about bringing the advantages of our type of
products into the simplified, graphic world of the Web. I think that 1996 will
be the year in which information retrieval goes mainstream, affecting even the
"traditional" research models.


     Tim Collins
     Division General Manager and Vice President
     EBSCO Publishing

     Many key issues of 1996 will relate to the struggle to effectively use
technology to integrate numerous products and services into comprehensive
solutions that allow information professionals to provide service to users at
lower costs.

     We will see this with the way information from periodicals is searched
and delivered. Librarians will no longer need to contract with different
vendors for each of the following services: subscription service, current
awareness service, periodical abstract/index databases, online search and
retrieval service, and document delivery service. Companies such as EBSCO
offer services that allow librarians to provide access to table of contents,
abstract, ASCII full text, and image full-text data through one search. The
services provide the ability to order documents or to learn where in the
library these documents are located if they are not available electronically.

     Electronic access to databases will become even more distributed
throughout organizations. More searching will be done directly from faculty
and employee desktops and less will be done from central libraries. School
libraries will provide searching through larger networks in the library, and
the extension of searching to the classroom will become more prevalent. Public
libraries will offer online services through their growing networks and will
begin to provide access to more computers dialing in from homes.

     The World Wide Web will become more and more prevalent and will emerge as
a legitimate source for accessing quality commercial data through
sophisticated search and retrieval software. It will mature and no longer have
the reputation as a fun place to find interesting, but not critical, free
data. Libraries will begin to find themselves competing with consumer online
services and Web sites for the attention of their constituents. Careful
comparison of data being offered by these sources will become critical.

     Primary publishers of consumer titles will experiment with ways to
provide their data inexpensively online to the masses and will look to
advertisers to cover the costs of online service providers much the way they
cover the cost of printers and typesetters now.

     A significant number of primary publishers of scientific, technical, and
medical data will cross the threshold and make their data available
electronically. Many pricing models will be used but, by the end of the year,
some models will emerge as being viable for the long run.

     Customizing services to the unique needs of individual users will become
a more important component of success. As companies struggle to provide
comprehensive solutions that merge multiple products and services it will be
a challenge to include the customization that each separate product and
service provided when it was offered alone.

     The provision of training and support to library professionals on the use
of these services will be an important factor in the purchase decisions at
small libraries as well as for large state-wide projects.

     Competition will be fierce among information service providers as they
struggle to establish or maintain their place in this rapidly changing
industry. Those that will be successful will be the ones that integrate
technology effectively and provide practical solutions at reasonable prices.


     Joe Bremner
     President
     Database Development

     As always, there seem to be more questions than answers. It is good to
see that the publishing industry--not the telephone or computer companies--is
absorbing the electronic information business. Significant acquisitions have
been made by companies like Wolters Kluwer, Thomson, Reed/Elsevier,
Knight-Ridder, and Pearson.

     In the last Commerce Department survey, the U.S. publishing industry and
related services had total revenues of nearly $200 billion, while the
electronic information industry (separately classified by the Commerce
Depart-ment) was approximately $15 billion. There was no way that this $200
billion industry was going to sit by and watch someone else steal its
franchise.

     We have argued for many years that the ascendancy and growth of the
"online business" was really a publishing anomaly that would be absorbed into
the publishing industry once its capabilities and potential capabilities
matured and were recognized. Those capabilities include its being a natural
successor to the structures in place in the publishing industry for
researching, assembling, editing, presenting, and distributing all types of
information.

     The publishing industry understands these processes better than any of
the other competitors who are scrambling to define the multimedia future. The
depth and diversity of the skills present in the publishing industry will
challenge the ability of computer or telecommunications players; it is not at
all clear that the rapidly conglomerating "entertainment" or "multimedia"
conglomerates will have significant scale or distribution advantages.

     Why? Well, of course, it's the Internet, which, stated another way, is an
open network that provides a kind of access to distribution for small players,
a development that may be unique in industrial history.

     What does this view of the future mean? One of the significant effects of
technology in this environment will be continued disintermediation of
aggregators and distributors. In an open network environment, how does one
define where WESTLAW ends and America Online begins? Given the passable job
that existing intelligent information agents do, and imagining how much more
powerful their successors will be, won't these tools further level the
distribution playing field--the open Internet-based playing field?

     Do the fits and starts of the Microsoft Network reveal a lack of
strategic "publishing" skills mentioned above? If the playing field remains
open, and the technology exists, publishers will create their own electronic
environments, target their traditional audiences--programmers, pilots, brides,
bankers, business managers--and bring them to that environment, using all of
the skills that helped them "own" those audiences in the past, and they may
not need Microsoft or other online services to help them.

     What will this mean for players like UMI, NEXIS, and ISI? Will they be
able to develop value-added services to maintain their holds on distribution
rights granted by publishers?

     The only thing I am certain of is that life will be exciting.


     Dr. K. Wayne Smith
     President and CEO
     OCLC Online Computer Library Center Inc.

     In 1996, we expect to continue pursuing our public purposes of furthering
access to the world's information and of reducing information costs. We will
also continue to aggressively pursue our goals of making OCLC's services
available around the clock, around the world.

     In 1996, we believe the OCLC community of 21,000 libraries in the U.S.
and 61 other countries will be thinking most about the following:

     1)   The Internet, the World Wide Web, and Web software will continue to
          grab headlines and shift paradigms. They will impact planning for
          library services at the local, regional, national, and international
          levels.

     2)   Libraries will increasingly bring their organizational and retrieval
          skills to bear on the Internet. They will start helping people find
          information on the Internet.

     3)   Libraries will continue to move closer to their dream of an
          electronic virtual library that integrates technical services,
          public services, archiving, and other library functions into a
          unified whole. More library patrons will log on to their libraries
          from their homes or offices.

     4)   As the pace of technological change quickens, the gap between
          information haves and have-nots will continue to grow. Libraries
          already recognize this growing gap and will try to narrow it.

     5)   Electronic scholarly publishing will begin to come of age in 1996.
          There will be a critical mass of electronic journals available from
          publishers that will provide libraries with new service and
          collection options and readers with a new way of accessing journal
          information.

     OCLC will be active on all of these fronts in 1996, from developing a
Java interface for its electronic journals to leading 185 libraries in an
Internet resource cataloging project, to offering financial subsidies for
libraries to trade in their older workstations for state-of-the-art machines,
to providing new products and services that will further reduce libraries'
costs.

     The OCLC community will mark the 25th anniversary of the OCLC Online
Union Catalog (OLUC) in 1996. With its 34 million records, some 600 million
location listings, and its more than 4,000 years of recorded knowledge in 360
languages, the OLUC has become a unique information resource highly valued by
scholars and researchers around the globe. It is a good example of what is
possible and probable on the emerging, global, digital, information highway.


     Patrick J. Tierney
     President and CEO
     Knight-Ridder Information, Inc.

     Organizational reengineering, converging technologies, and global
economics are inexorably reshaping the way organizations use information.
Managers must recognize that productivity is key, and no single information
product can satisfy all the requirements of all information users.

     Increasingly, information specialists, our core customers, are redefining
the function of the information center to make the best use of new
technologies, to build and manage organizational knowledge, and to deliver
information throughout the organization. They are being asked to serve as
consultants as well as researchers; to provide a "virtual library," available
24 hours a day to the desktop; to synthesize information from both internal
and external sources, including the Internet; and to deliver it to their
corporate clients. At the same time, their clients are becoming more
information-savvy and are placing ever greater demands on them as information
specialists.

     To meet their needs, Knight-Ridder Information is focusing its efforts on
providing integrated information solutions -- those that enable these
specialists to gather and deliver information quickly on an enterprise-wide
basis. One key product, KR ProBase, was introduced in Europe and North America
in 1995. Its familiar Windows-based interface gives searchers fast, easy,
point-and-click access to the outstanding collection of DataStar
databases--without learning a new search language. In 1996, we will extend
that convenience to the DIALOG service as well.

     The Internet has become the hot new medium for communications, and more
and more, it is an advertising-based medium, which will have a dramatic impact
on the future of services developed for it. At the same time, the "Intranet,"
or internal network utilizing Internet technologies, is emerging as a way to
build information sharing systems, which can blend internal and external
information sources for use throughout the organization.  Taking advantage of
the opportunity to bring information solutions to the desktop, we are
introducing the first two products in a new line of end-user services: KR
BusinessBase for the Windows operating system and KR ScienceBase for the World
Wide Web. And to ensure network-based document delivery, our 1995 acquisition
of The UnCover Company will permit us to significantly enhance our KR
SourceOne delivery service.

     The changes we are observing are not restricted to the U.S. As
technological advancements circle the globe, there is an increasing worldwide
demand for easy access to local information, and in many cases we see
technologies such as wireless communications that leapfrog the existing
infrastructure. Our KR Global-Reach service was developed to meet this need.
Introduced in 1995 and rapidly expanding, KR GlobalReach uses the Internet to
bring vital regional data to countries around the world, in their local
business languages.

     As we enter 1996, we are at the dawn of a new era of customer
expectations for information services. To meet those expectations, information
service pro-viders must go beyond our traditional offerings to create an
integrated suite of new and innovative tools that help information
professionals extend their reach into all functions of their organizations and
help information users increase their overall productivity.


     Tom Hogan
     President
     Information Today, Inc.

     When I was younger, nothing used to turn me off to a discussion more than
when one of my seniors would say that something had already been tried or
done. Using a past experience to win an argument seemed irrelevant and unfair.
They were saying, in effect, that "There is nothing new under the sun," which
can destroy one's sense of adventure and discovery.

     However, now that I've been in the electronic information business for
over 25 years, I find myself in the position of feeling compelled to recall a
few pieces of history in order to justify my predictions for the future.

     In the mid-1970s, after a few years of relative obscurity, online
services such as DIALOG and SDC Orbit began to assert themselves as viable
tools for information delivery. In 1975 I happened to be in charge of
marketing at Data Courier, and I remember online royalties for our ABI/Inform
database reaching $40,000 that year, an amount we considered quite good.
Today, UMI, which now owns that database, enjoys online royalties in the
millions.

     But the story doesn't end there. Because the word spread that there was
money to be made in online information, a kind of gold rush mentality swept
over the information publishing community, and databases of every shape, size,
and subject began appearing on one online service or another. Putting
something up online seemed to be the straightest path to fame and fortune.

     What people tended to forget, however, was that online users were
actually being asked to pay for the information they retrieved, and it turned
out that putting something up online didn't make it irresistible. There were
many more databases that produced very little revenue or failed altogether
than there were success stories such as ABI/Inform.

     Similarly, in the late '80s and early '90s, CD-ROM technology burst upon
the scene, and the gold rush began again. I wonder how many CD-ROM discs are
gathering dust in publishers' warehouses because people simply didn't want or
need the information they contain, no matter how attractive the technology was
or is.

     We now find ourselves faced with a new technology, the Internet, and the
frenzy has started all over again. Getting something up on the Internet,
establishing a site on the World Wide Web--surely this is the path to fame and
fortune in the mid-'90s and beyond.

     Somehow I doubt it.

     What I really think will happen, and here comes my prediction, is that
the zillion or so Internet users will come to understand in 1996 that really
valuable, accurate, reliable information comes with a price tag--just as it
always did in print, on microfilm, on CD-ROM, or online. Solid intellectual
property costs money. And if it costs money, then it better serve a real need.
Marshall McLuhan notwithstanding, the medium isn't the message. The message is
the message.

     Therefore, I hereby declare 1996 to be the "Year of Content." (Accent on
the first syllable of "content.") And my advice to publishers is to first make
sure you've got something people really want, regardless of the medium of
delivery, before investing time and money in the technology du jour. The
consumer is wiser than we may like to believe.

QUINT'S ONLINE: Censorship as Marketing Opportunity

     By Barbara Quint

     What this country needs is some good five-cent censors.

     Before you report me to the ACLU or have me barred from the next dinner
dance of the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee,
let me explain. On second thought, go ahead and report me. It's a free
country. I can say whatever I want. On third thought, maybe I will amplify my
remarks. Expensive market studies have shown that readers of leading trade
press publications dislike one-paragraph columns. See how quickly commercial
interest can affect political correctness!

     Harry Cohn, the much maligned movie mogul who founded Columbia
Pictures--and of whom, observing the large crowd at Cohn's funeral, comic Red
Skelton remarked, "Just goes to show. Give the people what they want and
they'll turn out."--anyway, Harry Cohn used to drive producers and directors
nuts with his somewhat vulgar test for whether a picture worked or not. It
concerned an itch in his posterior regions. Regardless of the anatomical
location, any good marketer or product designer better have an innate gift for
recognizing rashes and other allergic reactions when it comes to consumers.
The best and most successful products scratch itches, wherever they may occur.

     Censorship is an itch of long standing, an itch that crawled out of the
caves with the human animal, an itch that won't go away. Considered on its
broadest level, maybe it shouldn't go away. Review your own lives, especially
those of you over a certain age (and any age is a certain age). Don't you find
yourself almost as appreciative of some of the things you have never known,
never heard, never thought of as you are of the things that you have? How many
of us shake our heads and tsk-tsk at the deplorable depravities of the "other
generation"? Of course, what each person considers depravity varies. For some
it may mean ladies without hats and gloves on a public street; for others it
means ladies of the street. Some may condemn rap music ("Albums to Commit
Felonies By"), others New Age sound ("Will somebody PUH-LEEZ shut that
elevator door?!").

     Basically most people want to engineer silences as well as sounds.
Perhaps we all should be intellectual and spiritual "tabulae rasae," cool
dudes open to all experiences. Then again, maybe many of us are already double
parked, too busy with the problems at hand to reflect on problems
unrecognized. Or maybe our personal learning styles only absorb and create
true knowledge in a quiet corner huddled around a limited and manageable array
of data. Hurricanes of data can lead even the chronically curious to shut the
door on an open mind--at least until the winds die down.

     And so people turn to censorship, to systems that shut off information
flow. The more massive the data flow and the more stress factors related to
the data content, the more the censorship reaction occurs. Can we stop it? No.
Should we try to stop it? Maybe not.

A P.C. DISCLAIMER

     A brief pause for political correctness. In this column, my definition of
censorship is very broad. The dark side of censorship usually occurs when
people try to control not just what they themselves experience, but what
others can experience as well. Although people may have a right to not listen,
to not research, to not have to argue their positions, they don't necessarily
have the right to force on others the same silence or to deny others the
information needed to satisfy personal goals and beliefs.

     Borderline areas occur when one person does have legitimate
responsibility for the minds of others, such as parents for children or
teachers for pupils. As a rule, the closer the monitor and the monitored come
to a peer relationship, the less the legitimacy of the control. So parents of
2-year-olds have more right to control the perceived reality of their progeny
than parents of 12-year-olds, and practically none over 22-year-olds.
Kindergarten teachers have more sway than college professors. Employers may
even have some rights over the minds of employees--at least when they're
paying the employees for their "thought time" and for the information services
they use to support the thinking. (Has anyone seen that America Online
commercial where the guy laughs that his boss doesn't know he's really playing
games at work? Censor!!)

     The demands of alternative values or alternative scenarios for reaching
the same ends can also complicate issues of censorship. People oppose
censorship because they do not want truth silenced, but people support
censorship because they do not want truth buried under a deluge of lies,
half-truths, and noise. Even ardent defenders of academic freedom, for
example, will often still endure the "censorship" of the peer review standards
of scholarship.

     Democratic governments have longstanding barriers erected by
constitutional law against controlling the minds and mouths of the individuals
the governments serve. Most protections against censorship focus on government
as censor, probably because of the inequality of power between individuals and
"city halls." However, a government's obligation to protect the lives of its
constituents elicits constitutionally valid exemptions, as in the classic
metaphor of "crying 'Fire!' in a crowded theater."

FILTERS NOT CENSORS

     Let's focus on "authorized censors," those authorized by the very best
authorities--individual users shaping their own information environments. When
searchers go shopping, they often look for what vendors won't provide them as
well as for what they will. Rather than censorship products, perhaps we need
a new name for these "wanted-information-only" services. What about
information filters? Some information filter services follow traditional
product lines, yet perhaps use more high-tech production modes. Others
constitute software that the individual can apply or ignore to suit particular
information flow problems. Others form the basis for developing new
information environments.

     Of course, all database designers censor merely by setting rules of
inclusion and exclusion and defining scopes of coverage. The Internet may have
brought back the '60s, tie-dye morality (or amorality, depending on your world
view), but even the most complacent among us would have to admit that
commercial online sources represent The Establishment. Actually some databases
have biases that can be useful. Look at PR Newswire, the collection of
electronic press releases, the "company line online," so to speak.

     Frankly, PR Newswire often serves as a useful filter. For one thing, it's
honest about its biases. Business articles that appear in newspapers or the
trade press usually invoke some journalistic credibility, although they often
consist only of rehashed press releases. Then again, sometimes searchers don't
want critical, investigative reporting; they just want the official line. And
sometimes knowledgeable experts get too cute, and the official line turns out
to be the truth after all. In any case, it's convenient to have a database
that filters for the "official" version of reality.

     Electronic mail management software has grown more sophisticated as the
threat to users' time schedules has grown more dire. Any e-mail and listserv
user who travels out of town for a week or more can tell you of the cold
terror awaiting on return to base. Why do you think they sell so many laptop
computers? They're defense mechanisms from online overload. "Post-Boolean"
search engines in some e-mail managers can now rank messages by relevance,
allowing users to set priority levels. Online e-mail managers can sometimes do
the same. Do users ever miss anything important? Maybe, but some users may
decide it's better than losing large chunks of every workday.

     It's not only e-mail that needs filters. Many voicemail systems offer the
option of ranking messages. And why do you think they put speakers on your
answering machine? Of course, none of us would ever be rude enough to not pick
up the phone until we identified the caller and maybe the reason for the call.
Naah!

     The Internet's propensity for electronic frontier freedom has led to the
introduction of "real" censors. Trying to avoid lawsuits, bad press, and
Congressional virtue, vendors have started supplying rating and blocking
tools, like the V-chip, against "naughty bits." As the Internet continues its
inevitable march, the need to categorize and rank content will increase.
Already services such as the McKinley Group and Point Communications promise
to identify the "best" and most reliable Web sites.

     As television and the home computer overlap, new product opportunities
may arise. Frankly, cable television, not to mention direct satellite
broadcasting, is already out of hand. Even with a "TV Guide," you cannot
identify everything you could view at any given moment. As an occasional
C-SPAN binger, I was overjoyed to see a forum from them on the new Microsoft
Network (MSN). Imagine my dismay when it turned out that they only loaded the
previous day's schedule. What the heck good is that? But if I had an online
guide to all of the C-SPAN schedule along with all of the other cable and free
television broadcasts, I could start to craft an infotainment product of my
own. If the computer could turn the television and/or VCR on and off, the
online guide could form the basis for filtering mechanisms.

     The other day I saw a rather rowdy panel on C-SPAN where several major
television producers pounded on a congressman advocating the V-chip. The
producers didn't want any rating system for violence, electronic or otherwise,
because they think it will deter advertiser support and effectively censor
some shows off the air because of removed funding. On the other hand, the
bluntest opponent of the V-chip inadvertently admitted his own censoring
habits. Children under 5 in his household cannot watch any television. They
can only watch videotapes from Disney. His personal parental programming got
me to wondering. What happens after age 6?

     When I was 6 and 7 and 8 and so forth, television operated under a rigid
broadcasting code that only allowed the pure of heart and mouth on the air.
Now that's not going to happen these days, and maybe it's for the best. On the
other hand, I'm not sure that Bart Simpson or the Terminator is desirable as
a universal role model for impressionable youth either. Maybe parents could
program restricted access during the daylight hours or when they're not home.
American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies show flicks filmed under
equally restrictive codes. Nickelodeon shows old television and kid programs.
For youthful viewing, we could add program selections from PBS stations,
Discovery Channel, TLC (The Learning Channel), and maybe some news broadcasts.

     Of course, some people would put a Boolean NOT in front of all those
selections and turn their filters the opposite direction. Hey! It's a free
country.

     Regardless of the product produced, information vendors should keep
monitoring users for situations that lead to complaints about too much data
noise or too much of the wrong kind of information stimuli. Battered consumers

DATABASE REVIEW: THREE NEW DATABASES EXTEND DIALOG BUSINESS AND SCI-TECH
DATA LEAD

     By Mick O'Leary

     The year 1995 was one of furious activity in the arena of online business
information. Three major services--DataTimes, Profound, and NewsNet--received
extensive makeovers, involving colorful GUIs, new pricing schemes, and more
databases. This occurred in a climate of anticipation around new market
entrants, such as Microsoft Network, which has content from many leading
business database producers, and forthcoming services from AT&T and MCI. Amid
all of this hype, some of the other established services may appear to be a
little behind the curve. Even venerable DIALOG looks like it has some catching
up to do.

     In recent years DIALOG, with its pricing scheme that still depends
heavily on connect rate and its lack of a flashy, graphics-laden GUI, has
lagged behind some industry trends. Nevertheless, when it comes down to
content, DIALOG is still looking over its shoulder at the followers. Although
others may proclaim themselves as the "leading" or "most comprehensive"
business service, DIALOG is unrivaled or, at least, unsurpassed. The
definition of the "best" business service is in the eye of the beholder, but
by several definitions, DIALOG remains top dog. For its coverage of companies
and industries, for its depth of U.S. and international information, and for
its collection of textual, numeric, and directory files, DIALOG can make the
strongest claim for being the most comprehensive online business service.

     Three new business databases announced on DIALOG during the fall
strengthen its position. Two of them, D&B European Financial Records and
Kompass Eastern Europe, enrich DIALOG's large collection of company databases.
The third, International Business Directory, fits with DIALOG's strengths in
both business and sci-tech information.

NEW DATA FROM D&B

     DIALOG and Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) have long been one of the strongest
online service/database producer partnerships. DIALOG was the first external
supplier for D&B and remains a major third party host for D&B databases. The
newest database, D&B European Financial Records, extends DIALOG's set of
detailed financial data to non-U.S. companies. European Financial Records is
comparable to Duns Financial Records Plus, which contains financials for over
a million U.S. businesses, nearly all of which are privately held.

     European Financial Records (EFR) covers 2.4 million businesses in 13
Western European nations. Those most heavily represented are the U.K., France,
the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, with smaller numbers of records
from Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra, and San Marino.

     The data in an EFR record is similar to that found in Duns Financial
Records Plus:

     --   Company profile with name, address, phone, primary and secondary SIC
          codes, officers, number of employees, banks, premises, and year
          started

     --   Corporate family, including subsidiaries with percentage of
          ownership, branches, and immediate parent

     --   Financials (including sales, profits, net worth, assets,
          liabilities, debts, and capital), assets and liabilities broken down
          into over a dozen items, and three years of annual totals expressed
          both in local currency and in U.S. dollars

     --   Thirteen key ratios, with three-year annual totals

     Most of these fields are searchable, so that a record can be customized
to almost any desired set of fields. The ability to pick and choose among data
elements is welcome in this expensive database--a full record is $75 and
connect rate is $90/hr.

     EFR must be used with the same caveats that apply to DFR and other D&B
databases. Many company records are not complete and may have only summary
financial information. Figures may be D&B estimates when data from the company
itself are absent. Financials are also based on annual totals, which may not
reveal the company's current situation.

KOMPASS LINE EXPANDS

     European company information is also the focus of the latest in the
Kompass series. Unlike the D&B files, which concentrate on financial data, the
Kompass databases emphasize product information with detailed product listings
from thousands of companies worldwide.

     The Kompass databases are produced by an international consortium of
business directory publishers. Other Kompass databases cover Western Europe,
the U.K., and the Asia/Pacific region, as well as several individual
countries. They concentrate on manufacturing and industrial firms that sell
business-to-business, including related service companies. Kompass Eastern
Europe lists 100,000 companies from Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Croatia, and the Yugoslav region.

     A Kompass record provides a brief company profile containing name,
address, phone, fax, type of business (manufacturer, distributor, etc.),
industry sector, sales, number of employees, principal officers, and summary
parent/subsidiary information. Product line information is more specific, with
a thorough listing of the company's products and services. They are arranged
according to the Universal Commodity System, a classification widely used in
Europe. The system classifies 45,000 different products and services, allowing
for precise description of a company's product line.

     Most fields in a Kompass record are searchable. Product terms are
arranged hierarchically so that a search on a broad product class will
retrieve all of the more specific subclasses within it. Befitting Kompass'
wordly flavor, records can be obtained in English, German, French, Spanish, or
Italian; product names can be searched in any of the languages. The records
for each country are updated annually on a rotating basis; thus, at any time
a given record may be substantially out of date. Kompass Eastern Europe is
exclusively on DIALOG, where it joins several other Kompass files.

TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRANSFER

     The International Business Directory is misnamed, since it is actually a
directory of technologies for transfer from both profit and nonprofit
organizations. It is based on the The World Bank of Licensable Technology, a
directory produced by the Canadian Industrial Innovation Centre.

     The database lists over 26,000 technologies that can be licensed in
manufacturing, chemicals, electronics, medicine, agriculture, energy,
construction, and communications. Technology descriptions are provided by
hundreds of licensing organizations including companies, research labs,
universities, and government agencies. The directory is international, with
input from over three dozen countries, although three-quarters of the content
comes from the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.

     Each record briefly describes the technology, its uses and advantages,
development stage, patent number, and licensing terms. Not all records have
this complete description; many have only summary descriptions and may lack
other record elements. Records also contain supplier information, industry
sector names, and a contact person. Most record fields are searchable.

     The International Business Directory is DIALOG exclusive. As a mixed
business and technical database, it is a small but useful addition to DIALOG's
great collections in each area. DIALOG's status as the leading business
service may be subject to honest dispute, but as the best common source for
business and sci-tech data, there is no question.

over 15 years. He is the director of the library at Frederick, Maryland, and

                       D&B EUROPEAN FINANCIAL RECORDS
                           KOMPASS EASTERN EUROPE
                      INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DIRECTORY

     SYNOPSIS

          Three new business/product directories provide detailed financial
     and product information for millions of companies, especially in Europe.

     databases.

LEGAL LINE: LAW FIRM HOME PAGES MADE EASY

     By Cary Griffith

     One of the most memorable announcements of 1995 was West Publishing's
plans to create home pages for the more than 800,000 attorneys listed in
"West's Legal Directory." At the time, it was the kind of announcement that
surprised many people, considering the amount of work the project would
require. But now two occurrences make West's announcement even more memorable.

     Six months after the announcement, the legal industry is beginning to see
the results of West's labors. These results are worth some examination.

LEGAL INDUSTRY INTEREST IN THE INTERNET IS GROWING

     In six months the legal industry's attention to the Internet has gone
from marginal interest on the part of a few practicing attorneys to something
much more significant. How significant? An anecdotal survey of large law
offices finds that, of the dozen or so contacted, all either had home pages,
were contemplating home pages, or at the very least had Internet access. For
some their presence may be limited to simple access through a local Internet
provider. But if you ever get on the Internet with a World Wide Web (WWW)
browser, you'll find that the legal industry's Internet presence is taking
some interesting turns.

     At the 1995 ABA TechShow, the Internet presentations were among the most
attended sessions. At the time (March 1995), over 50 medium or large law firms
were listed as having WWW home pages. Today, even barring West's announced
home page development, the number is too great to count and still growing.

     Why are law offices expressing an interest in WWW home page development?

     "It allows people in the general public to obtain information about a
firm without any barriers," says Joe Lester, a Bloomington, Minnesota,
attorney who offers a Web site focusing on business and technology law
(http://www.mnlaw.com). Like many other Internet observers, Lester points to
two important features that make an Internet presence worth considering,
particularly for law offices.

     Once a home page is located, most provide the researcher with a variety
of information they can't find anyplace else: links to examples of the
attorney's work or links to related home pages or subjects that can be very
useful.

     "It's an alternative to going to a printed directory," explains Lester.
"You can [do a] search, based upon categories of information, that would lead
you to a variety of firms, and then from there, link into more specific types
of information that may or may not be of interest."

     Another reason Internet observers like Lester are pointing to the
importance of an Internet presence is because of the advertising/marketing
exposure. "For the firm it is extremely high-value marketing. The firm can
provide useful information, at a very low cost, that's much more accessible
than traditional print advertising or directories."

WEST'S HOME PAGE PROGRAM

     Given the growing importance of having an Internet presence, many firms
are trying to figure out how to get started, without realizing they may
already have a WWW home page.

     According to a press release dated August 3, 1995, West Publishing was in
the midst of creating "home pages for all of more than 800,000 profiles
contained within West's Legal Directory (WLD) . . . West Publishing will
create a WWW home page for each of the private practice attorneys, law firms,
corporate counsel, government attorneys, and other legal professionals listed
on WLD. Each home page is accessible free of charge to users browsing the WWW
and to clients interested in gathering information on legal professionals."

     Part of West's continued development includes improving the e-mail field
for each WLD profile so individuals have easier access to Internet e-mail. And
each professional's WLD profile will have an Internet URL field. The URL field
will link the user to the firm or attorney home page. In this way WLD will
become a locator for each attorney's home page.

     The preceding commits to a significant amount of home page development.
Unfortunately, in many cases those home pages will not reach their full
potential. Unless attorneys take an interest in their home pages, they won't
provide any more information than what's already noted in their WLD listing.
But it's worth noting that West's press release went on to state that "in
addition, West is offering an opportunity for law firms to customize the
design and information contained with their Internet home page."

     For a sample of an informative home page design, consider the law offices
of Briggs and Morgan (http://www.briggs.com). Internet users accessing this
site first view an introductory page like the one depicted in Figure 1.

     The introductory screen contains little more than the Briggs and Morgan
logo and a phone number. But notice the reference to "Briggs and Morgan's Web
Pages." The plural is significant, because if you scroll through Briggs'
introductory screen you'll find it's actually very brief. In fact, the entire
home page takes up approximately three screens. But each Briggs screen is
packed with a lot of information, and the details can be acquired by simply
pointing and clicking.

     Anyone who has spent much time browsing the Internet will recognize this
design. The beauty of the Briggs page is in its simple design and in the way
it leaves further perusal to the browser. For example, if I wanted to view the
biographical listing for a Briggs attorney, I could simply click on the
Profiles icon (third from left near the middle of the screen--see Figure 2).
That takes you to a list of Briggs and Morgan Attorney Profiles, which
identifies every Briggs attorney in alphabetical order. If you want to see
more information on a particular attorney, simply click on the person's name,
and you're taken to the full WLD listing for the attorney.

     Similarly, if I was interested in learning more about Briggs' practice,
I could click on About or Practice. If I wanted to learn more about the
advantages of Briggs' law firm I could click on Advantages. And if I wanted to
view some of their publications, I could click on Alerts or Other
Publications.

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR

     How much does it cost to get West's assistance in creating a customized
home page on the Internet? According to West, it depends on what you want to
list. But general costs can be anywhere from $1,500 per year (for solo
practitioners) to several thousand dollars a year for a large law firm with a
very detailed listing. The price really depends on firm size and on the
complexity, layout, and content of the home page design.

     However, if a law firm compared the prices of outsourcing or setting up
a home page itself (design of home page, establishing themselves as a WWW
site, etc.), the costs would easily exceed $30,000. Similarly, if a firm
outsourced the design of a home page and rented space with a local Internet
provider (to house the home page) the approximate annual costs could be as
much as $9,000.

     West offers an extremely comprehensive service, guaranteeing what it
calls 7/24: The home pages are available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
West also offers a directory that can be searched in a variety of complex
ways, enabling users to find home pages for attorneys they would otherwise
have to find through other, weaker search engines.

     Interested users can view a demonstration firm site on the Internet.
Tennyson & Keye, a fictitious law firm West created as an example of its WWW
home page services, can be found at http://demo.wld.com. If you have the right
equipment, you can even view the Tennyson & Keye home page's video
presentation.

     One surmises that West is offering all firms a home page as both an
enhancement of its directory and as a way to give those attorneys not
currently participating with a full page in the directory more enticement to
do so.

     Nothing in life is free, but if you compare the price of going out and
creating your own home page (a process I'm in the middle of--and I expect it's
going to cost around $50 per month, which doesn't include the actual page
creation), West's deal looks very good.

CONCLUSION

     1995 was a year of both remarkable news and phenomenal growth on the
Internet. On occasion, both of these phenomena intersected. West's
announcement regarding home page development was the kind of intersection most
attorneys appreciated.

     Providing home pages for the attorneys listed in WLD not only makes
marketing sense for WLD but also presents a great marketing opportunity for
every attorney practicing today.

CD-ROM COMMENTARIES: WHAT WILL DRIVE CD-ROM DRIVES IN 1996?

     By Peter Jacso

     Survival instinct, that's what will drive them. CD-ROM drive
manufacturers (and CD-ROM database publishers) have been under a great deal of
pressure lately from all sides. The phenomenal growth of Internet access, the
plummeting price of hard disks with gigabytes of capacity, the incredibly
successful ZIP drives of Iomega, the launching of the phase-change dual
technology (PD) discs, and the promise of super-high-density discs prompted
many industry observers to write obituaries for CD-ROM.

Count me out. I still believe in the feasibility of CD-ROMs. There have been
constant improvements in CD-ROM technology. We saw some of this in 1995; more
will come in 1996.

TRANSFER RATE IMPROVEMENTS

     CD-ROM drives had been tagging along at the 150 KB/second transfer rate
for quite a time, until the first double-speed (2x) drives--transferring 300
KB of data per second--appeared on the market in 1992. Single-speed drives
were acceptable for text and audio databases. Single-speed, however, turned
out to be inappropriate for animation and the first video clips, even if they
were of postage stamp size. This ushered in first the double-speed and, in
1993, the unusual triple-speed (3x) drives from NEC. They were followed in
1994 by the first quadruple-speed (4x) drives and another odd drive, the
quintuple-speed from NEC. There are other drives with odd transfer rates, such
as the 4.5-speed Toshiba, Panasonic, and Plextor models, and the 4.4-speed
Pioneer.

     The rate at which transfer speed has been increasing since 1992 has been
quite impressive. It was obvious that we wouldn't have to wait long for
sextuple-speed drives, and, indeed, in 1995 they arrived from NEC, Plextor,
and TEAC. Mitsumi, the number-one drive manufacturer for OEM purposes due to
its low prices, has a 6x drive for less than $300 (which translates to about
a $200 OEM price). This time, Mitsumi doesn't skimp on buffer size, featuring
a 128 K buffer. Toshiba demonstrated its 6.7-speed XM-3701 drives (in both
internal and external versions) at Fall COMDEX. Why 6.7x? Because it just
breaks the 1 MB/second transfer rate and is certainly a good eye-catcher in
the ads.

     Yes, you guessed right. The first 8x drive--from Diamond--just started
shipping, and NEC and Chinon plan to ship their 8x drives by the time you read
this. Others may join the fray, although I am somewhat skeptical. I wonder if
it is worth stretching the transfer rate further at this time. To achieve this
speed, the discs must be spinning at 4,000-5,000 revolutions per minute,
depending what part of the disc is being read. (Your Walkman spins the disc at
about 450 rpm, for the sake of comparison.) This generates a lot of heat,
noise, and resonance, and may not result in a perceivable performance
improvement for the user.

     Though motion video could benefit from faster transfer rate, it is
unlikely that there will be any multimedia titles that would include video
recorded with a view toward this 1.2 MB/second transfer rate. Title developers
in 1995 still optimized their video compression for the double-speed drives
(still the largest segment of CD-ROM drives). This will probably change this
year for the annually updated or newly released titles, which are likely to be
optimized for a quad-speed, 600 KB/second transfer rate that will become
dominant in drives. Running such titles on drives sporting transfer rates
higher than quad speed is only marginally beneficial, except when files are
copied (instead of being played back) from the CD-ROM, as in the case of
installing program suites.

     Displaying text and playing audio files from an application do not call
for a higher rate than 150 KB/second. Still images shown as a slide show even
with recorded narration are more than happy with a quad-speed transfer rate,
so why torture the mechanical parts of the drive by spinning it madly? It is
like running to the bus stop even when there is no bus in sight. Much more
important is the balanced performance of the drive. Transfer rate is only one
element of the drive's speed. Equally important is the access time of the
drive.

ACCESS TIME IMPROVEMENTS

     In order to transfer data, first the read mechanism has to get to the
appropriate section. This is known as access time, measured in milliseconds
(ms). This has also improved by the same factor as transfer rate over the
10-year timespan, but in a reverse pattern. The first drives had 900- to
1,000-ms access time (and IBM's entry to the field was via a drive with a
pathetically high 1,500-ms access time and a ridiculous price tag of $1,200).
In a year or two, access time halved, then went down to 300- to 350-ms,
stagnated there for a while, and now typically hovers around 200 ms.

     A few current drives and most of the new ones that will come out this
year sport access times of less than 200-ms. This is very important, because
users jump from sector to sector not only in bibliographic databases (e.g.,
when a subject search yields records scattered all around the disc) but also
in multimedia applications (e.g., when a hyperlink is activated to jump from
the article on Hungarian music to the biography of Franz Liszt). It is rather
disappointing (and misleading) when a headline in a good magazine that sells
about a million copies claims that "Speedy 6x Drives Make CD-ROM Searches a
Snap" ("PC World," December 1995). It is akin to saying that faster planes
make getting from New York to Boston a snap. Flying time and commuting time
between the city and the airport together define the effective travel time.
There may be some further improvements in decreasing access time but the
current champion, the Plextor 4Plex with a 135-msec average access time, will
be hard to beat soon.

JUKEBOX IMPROVEMENTS

     For quite a long time Pioneer was the only manufacturer of a jukebox
(CD-ROM changer) accommodating six discs in a cartridge. Then came the
seven-disc version from Mountain Network in 1994. These were a godsend for
such megadatabases as MEDLINE or the CDMARC database from the Library of
Congress. There were significant innovations in late 1995 that will have an
impact on the market in 1996.

     Gateway started to include (for a $100 premium) dual-disc minijukeboxes
last year. NEC released four-disc, then seven-disc minichangers, both with a
quad-speed transfer rate. They had the attractive innovation of not requiring
you to handle the entire cartridge when replacing a disc but just ejecting and
inserting a single disc. The 350-ms access time, however, was a letdown. NEC
probably will improve on both jukeboxes in trying to catch up with the new
six-disc Pioneer changer sporting 4.4x transfer rate and 150-ms average access
time. With the ever increasing availability of ready reference titles, even
home users will demand such CD-ROM changers--at a reasonable price--to hold
several discs on tap. There are super jukeboxes storing hundreds of discs
quasi-online, and these will facilitate the management of such gigantic image
databases as UMI's Business Periodicals Ondisc, Ovid's Core Biomedical
Collection, and other upcoming CD-ROM megadatabases.

PORTABILITY IMPROVEMENTS

     The most visible CD-ROM technology development in 1995 was the
proliferation of CD-ROM drives built into the latest generation of notebook
computers. There are many users, however, who don't have built-in CD-ROM
drives in their notebook computers. Until now, the best they could do was to
have a double-speed CD-ROM drive with a parallel port connector (less commonly
with a PC Card, or PCMCIA, Connector), and with a bulky AC adapter. This
scenario is also going to change.

     There were plenty of stylish, sleek, affordable, and more powerful
portable CD-ROMs at the COMDEX show, and mouth-watering promises for the first
and second quarter of 1996. PC Card-type connection is to become the norm. The
double-speed PacRIM Labs CyberMan CD is remarkable for including a 16-bit,
44-KHz, wavetable synthesis chip and a 256 K buffer in the CD-ROM--which is
multisession-capable and also plays CD-i discs. EXP Computer, Inc. was the
first portable (if somewhat bulky) parallel-port-based CD-ROM player that did
not require an AC adaptor. It now has the drive with a PC Card interface, and
promises to have quadruple- and sextuple-speed drives by June. These, however,
will require an AC adapter because of the significant power consumption.

     CNF Inc. and Chase Advanced Technologies offered the two most stylish and
lightweight double-speed portable drives, the Cardport CD and the DISQ,
respectively, at the very competitive price of $220 to $230. Both companies
promise a 6x portable drive by March or April. Axonix--a longtime provider of
portable CD-ROM drives for notebook computers--has both 4x and 6x variants,
with an amazing 160-ms access time. Axonix is currently testing the
possibility of using the keyboard connector for power supply instead of a
separate adaptor. I am not the only one who would be overjoyed at this,
because in notebook computing every ounce and extra cable count.

     Even at these aggressively increasing transfer rates and moderately
decreasing access times, CD-ROMs will remain an order of magnitude behind
current hard disks on both counts. But they were never meant as hard-disk
replacements. The alternative media and drives (magneto optical, phase-dual,
super-density, the ZIP, and the JAZ) that seem to be threatening CD-ROMs have
their own niche. As we shall see next month, they complement well what CD-ROMs
are used for these days.

CD-ROM REVIEW: "GALE BUSINESS RESOURCES:" GOOD CONTENT, CLUMSY INTERFACE

     By Linda Rosen

     Gale is known throughout the library community for high-quality reference
products in the form of books, online databases, and even CD-ROMs. That's why
it's so puzzling that the company's latest attempt to put many of its volumes
of business reference information on CD-ROM is so clumsy. If it weren't for
some of the useful content in this product it would not be worth looking at as
a viable reference tool for a library. As it currently exists, "Gale Business
Resources" is a misfire that can certainly be recovered if Gale puts some
development and effort into it.

     The main defect in the product is its interface. Amazingly, this is a
DOS-based product. Although there is a "graphical interface" through which the
user can navigate with a mouse, the buttons and screen design throughout are
very "non-standard." By this I mean that when you single-click on a button in
a Windows-based software product, you will get an immediate response. In the
"Gale Business Resources" product, you need to double-click on that button and
even then response is mighty slow. In a discussion with a spokesperson at
Gale, I learned that the intended market for this product was public and
academic libraries, who, Gale decided through its own research, were not using
Windows-based computers and were unlikely to do so until at least later this
year. Since business and corporate libraries were not a target market, Gale
decided to go with the DOS platform only. This is the main reason not to buy
the product now.

CONTENT IS KING

     Interface aside, (but it's extremely hard to ignore it while using the
product), some of the content and ideas that Gale has for the product have
merit. You can't go wrong with standbys like the "Encyclopedia of
Associations," "Companies and Their Brands," "Consultants and Consulting
Organizations Directory," and "Ward's Business Directory" (to name a few).
These appear to be the gems of the product in terms of content. Others include
"American Wholesalers and Distributors Directory;" "Business Rank-ings
Annual;" "Encyclopedia of American Industry;" "Finance, Insurance and Real
Estate USA;" "International Directory of Company Histories;" "Manufacturing
USA;" and "Service Industries USA."

     A total of 30 volumes of Gale's business references with full text of the
"Fortune 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission Reports" (on a separate
CD-ROM) and the "US Industrial Outlook" are also included.

     A selection of Gale products are available on CD-ROM and through online
databases. For example, the "Encyclopedia of Associations" is available in
both of these formats. "Gale Business Resources" brings many of the best Gale
reference products together in one place. The idea is great, but so far the
execution leaves much to be desired.

SEARCHING BY COMPANY, BRANDS, INDUSTRY, EXTENDED

     The main screen (which never leaves you, even if you don't want to see it
in the background the entire time) provides four buttons to begin your
research. So far, so good. But try to click on a button as you might in a
Windows-based application and nothing happens. Click again and finally the
system slogs through to the next screen. If you are used to working in DOS and
have the patience to endure yet another interface that doesn't look like or
behave like anything else you use, you might be willing to use this product.

     You cannot successfully run "Gale Business Resources" in a DOS window if
you are using Windows. The speed degrades so completely that it simply isn't
worth it.

     Select the "Company" button and you are presented with a scroll-type
listing of companies to choose from. The product includes information on
210,000 firms (many are divisions within a company). You have to choose a
company and then look at the brief profile to determine if it's really the one
you want. If you choose Novell as the company, for example, you are presented
with several listings: for Novell, Novell Inc., and Novell Corp., and it's not
initially clear which is the main one you want. You can choose to mark a range
of companies in this screen.

     Once companies have been selected, you can view the details in one of
several formats (Full, Brief, Mailing, or Custom). One company I chose had
only SIC and brands listed but no mailing address information. It's hit or
miss. Move from the Company Information screen to Industry Information, and
you are offered a listing of SIC codes and descriptions for the industries in
which the companies are engaged. Industry Information that's available for
most of the industries on this disc includes Market Share Reports, Rankings,
Articles & Essays, Associa-tions, and Statistics.

     In my quest to find information on the software industry I viewed each of
the items available. Market Share Reports is data culled from Gale's "Market
Share Reporter" and tends to be quite dated, especially for information on
this fast-paced industry. Rankings, too, tended to have data not much more
current than 1993. Articles & Essays appears to come from the "Encyclopedia of
American Industry" and does not include current articles from industry
publications. For the report on software, the very latest information included
was excerpted from a March 1994 article. Articles & Essays should more
properly be called Industry Background and History. Current, it is not.

     The Associations section is, of course, based on the "Encyclopedia of
Associations." This has always been a great product, so it's hard to look bad,
even in this clumsy interface. If your goal is to find associations, however,
the books, online version, or dedicated CD-ROM version are better choices.

     Statistics appear to come mainly from the "U.S. Bureau of the Census and
County Business Patterns." This again is not current data (no fault of Gale),
but Statistics might not be the right moniker for this section--again, it
might be more accurate to call this section U.S. Government Industry
Statistics.

BRANDS AND THEIR COMPANIES, COMPANIES AND THEIR BRANDS

     One of the more useful resources in this product is Gale's "Companies and
Their Brands," searchable through the Product and Brand Name button on the
main menu. You can find information on more than 116,000 brands and 15,000
products in 1,000 industries. The same procedures apply as with a company
search. You choose a brand or product name with a scrollable list, mark the
ones you want, and then look at the companies with which those brands are
associated. You can then move into company or industry information as
described above. Again, if the interface and speed of the product were at all
modern, this could be a very useful tool for finding brand information and
then exploring the companies and industries associated with it.

EXTENDED SEARCH

     Ostensibly, the Extended Search option from the main menu allows you to
simultaneously search multiple fields in the "Gale Business Resources"
database. As the manual suggests: ". . . you could search for all software
companies in California with revenues between $100,000 and $250,000, or all
companies with a 212 area code that manufacture ophthalmic goods." Although
the capability is there, the execution of the interface and the slowness of
the search system bog down this process. The Extended Search is built around
a series of tab cards that each offer a different access point to the data. As
in other parts of the program, the response you get by clicking on these cards
is not what you would expect in a Windows application, but it sort of looks
like it and kind of behaves like it.

     Extended Search "Cards" are available for Contacts (company name,
officers' names, parent company, phone), Location (city, state, ZIP code, area
code), Industry (SIC, industry description), Scope (number of employees, year
founded, revenue, stock exchange, ticker symbol), Profile (description of
business, publications, seminars, and special services offered by the
company), and Products (brand name and description). The concept is good, the
underlying information is uneven, and the search software is inadequate for
this type of sophisticated search. Too bad, it would be great otherwise.

SEC REPORTS AVAILABLE

     If you happen on a company for which an SEC report is available (1,000
10K reports are included for top public companies), you'll see an SEC Report
button to choose in the company profile. Click on this and the system will
prompt you to insert the second CD-ROM, which includes the full text of these
reports. Awkward, but not unreasonable.

A FINAL WORD ON THE INTERFACE

     An additional ongoing problem with the program is the lengthy text
screens that provide no other navigation mechanism than to continually press
the Page Down button on the keyboard or to double-click the mouse on the tiny
More button on the screen. There is no "slider" down the side of the text box
to indicate the length of the article or to be able to quickly navigate
through it. This makes exploration of the Articles & Essays section, for
example, quite painful.

     Information can be printed and exported from any portion of the program.
Exported data is put into an ASCII file and can also be downloaded as comma
delimited. Again, this is a clumsy way to deal with data today. Cutting and
pasting has become second nature to many people. Exporting to an ASCII file
and then bringing the file into a word processor harkens back to dark days of
database searching.

IN CONCLUSION

     The price for" Gale Business Resources" is $7,995 per year and includes
quarterly updates. If you priced out the separate costs for all of the
resources included in this product, the cost of having them on this one disc
is a good deal. However, access to the data is severely affected by the poor
interface and the value of the information is therefore compromised by this
inaccessibility. If you're going to spend nearly $8,000 for a CD-ROM product,
you probably won't be too concerned about buying a PC with Windows. Gale is
missing a great opportunity in corporate libraries and especially in small
businesses where a tool like this could be really valuable.

     Cut down on the price, modernize the interface and search software, and
remove the dated material from "Gale Business Resources," and you might really
have something.

MULTIMEDIA MEDLEY: COMDEX '95 AND MULTIMEDIA IN '96

     By Peter Jacso

     Las Vegas, which I visited recently to attend Fall COMDEX, claims to have
become a family destination. I had my doubts as I waded through the sleazy
complimentary magazines scattered on the sidewalks. But I have never doubted
that Las Vegas was the perfect host for this computer show, which it has been
for the past 17 years.

     The show has been getting bigger and better every year. This time, it
attracted 210,000 visitors and over 2,000 exhibitors. Multimedia was even more
at the heart of the show than it was in 1994, as it came not only from CD-ROMs
but from the hundreds of World Wide Web sites.

     As usual, a visit to COMDEX makes it easy to predict what computers and
information technology applications the next 12 months will bring into our
homes and offices. Here I only give a condensed report of what the multimedia
landscape is likely to look like, but in later columns this year I will
discuss particular issues more closely.

MULTIMEDIA TO GO

     The most impressive trend to me was the coming of age of affordable,
genuine multimedia notebook computers. IBM undoubtedly had the show stopper
with its incredible ThinkPad 760CD, featuring a 90 MHz Pentium, 8 megabytes
(surprisingly low) of RAM, a 12-inch active-matrix screen capable of 16
million colors at 640X480 mode, or 65,000 colors at 800X600 mode, a
1.2-gigabyte hard disk, a quadruple-speed drive, and an MPEG-2 chip for video
playback. All this in a sleek design. It's no surprise that this horsepower
allows stunning broadcast-quality video. At the $10,000 price (including
shipping and handling!), however, it will not be the mainstream multimedia
laptop in 1996. Nonetheless, it was as impressive as Batman's car.

     But there were also numerous notebooks capable of very decent multimedia
performance for $3,500 to $4,500. Among the big guns, Texas Instruments leads
the way in price/performance with its entry-level Extensa 550CD multimedia
notebook. For just under $3,000, it has a 75 MHz Pentium processor, 8
megabytes of RAM, 1 megabyte of video RAM, 10.4-inch dual-scan display (256
colors at 640X480), PCI bus architecture, 16-bit sound card, microphone and
speakers, 524-megabyte hard drive, and double-speed CD-ROM. Many lesser-known
manufacturers (AMS, Sager, Patriot) have this typical entry-level multimedia
configuration at even lower prices. Some notebooks with similar
capabilities--such as the Vectra 4000 from NEC and the Gateway Solo
V75--seemed to be overpriced and are likely to be reduced by early this year.

     I saw many mouth-watering midrange multimedia notebooks (Toshiba
Satellite Pro 410, NEC Versa 4000, Gateway Solo) for about $4,000 to $5,000,
sporting 90- or 100-MHz Pentiums, 8 to 16 megabytes of RAM, 540- to
720-megabyte hard disks, active matrix or dual-scan screens, and
quadruple-speed built-in CD-ROMs. Toshiba announced at the show the price of
the Tecra 700 Series, which will represent the high end of the multimedia
notebook market this year. The Tecra 700CT has a 120-MHz Pentium, 16 megabytes
of RAM, a 1-gigabyte hard drive, 11.3-inch active matrix display capable of
65,000 colors at 800X600 resolution, 16-bit audio, and a quadruple-speed
CD-ROM drive. At a price of $6,000, it certainly will not be an impulse buy.
Gateway announced a similar notebook at the same price, and others will follow
suit.

DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA PROWESS

     On the desktops we shall see 100- to 120-MHz Pentiums, with 16 megabytes
of RAM, 15- to 17-inch monitors (with 65,000 colors at 800X600),
quadruple-speed drives, 1.2-gigabyte hard drives capable of full-screen,
full-motion video (through MPEG-1 chips on the motherboard), and hi-fi audio
quality (through DSP--Digital Signal Processor--chips instead of sound boards)
for about $2,300 to $3,000. IBM sets the tone for the mainstream multimedia
desktop with its Aptiva series. Although its case design is nondescript at
best, what is inside the box is impressive and sufficient for good multimedia
playback. You will not see new models featuring Intel 486 processors and
double-speed drives, as these will become passe this year and will be sold
only at close-outs.

AUDIO HARMONY AND CACOPHONY

     Recorded audio performance cannot be much improved beyond CD-quality, but
the synthetic music renderings certainly will get better, because in almost
all the new audio cards you'll find wave-table synthesis support for MIDI
playback. Audio installation will be much easier because the majority of the
new multimedia systems will come with DSP chips, and users will not need to
know any more about them than they do about math co-processors. While sound
boards will still be sold (for the sake of those who want to upgrade their
existing systems), it will be a much easier task to install the new
plug-and-play sound boards if you are using Windows 95 and let the hardware
wizard take over the "seating" arrangement as a maitre d'.

     Enhanced CDs will probably be a disappointment. I have played with half
a dozen titles, and (as I will detail in my February column) most of them were
unimpressive and overpriced. Some of my reasons, of course, may be subjective.
It is, however, an objective fact that the much-heralded Enhanced CD,
particularly the CD Plus (Blue Book) format, will have a very rocky start. As
if it had not caused enough cacophony and confusion, why are there three
different enhanced CD formats (Track Zero, Track One and CD Plus)? The latter
format will not run on any of the NEC, Toshiba, and Sanyo drives manufactured
before August 1995. This represents at least hundreds of thousands of drives
and a pretty large number of angry customers who will ditch their Sony CD Plus
discs and be utterly skeptical about the Enhanced CD concept (see my sidebar,
"CD Plus Turns Out to Be CD Minus" on page 34).

     What gave me some peace of mind amid this cacophony was listening to the
series of sound clips from Network Music in the most elegant and comfortable
booth of the show. We have heard and seen a lot of CD-ROMs with audio clips,
but this series exudes professionalism and quality. There are five volumes
(business/office, high tech, pop culture, etc.), each with 30 music samples in
30- and 60-second, short-tag and loop versions of perfectly recorded music at
11 and 22 KHz, and 100 sound effects that you may edit (for perfectly timed
fade-in and fade-out) and convert to different sampling rates, frequency, and
even to compressed format to include in your multimedia presentation. There
are certainly cheaper alternatives, but you get what you pay for. Along with
stock film and video footage, this type of mediaware will be significant this
year.

DIGITAL VIDEO DELIGHT

     Delightful digital video will finally arrive  this year in a convenient
and affordable way. The key to that will be MPEG compression/decompression.
MPEG-1 playback chips on the motherboards or on the video accelerator cards
will be widespread and will provide full-screen, full-motion video at least at
videotape quality. MPEG-2 decoder chips (for broadcast-quality video) will be
limited to the high-end market because of the price. However, MPEG-1 movies
(320X240 resolution and 24 frames/second) will be played back also without
hardware decoders. I have heard claims that MPEG clips played with
software-only decoders will produce decent video on 33-MHz Intel 486
processors, but my own experience clearly suggests that a 75-MHz Pentium and
double-speed drive are required as a minimum. As this will be the entry-level
multimedia machine, I believe that many of the multimedia titles will have
MPEG videos by mid-1996.

     CompCore impressed me the most with its MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 hardware
products and particularly with the video quality of the SoftPEG software-only
decompressor. There have already been many contenders for hardware MPEG
solutions, but this fairly young company managed to license its technology to
such industry heavyweights as NEC, Packard Bell, Hitachi, Cirrus Logic, and
ATI. It is akin to starting with a few Grand Slam trophies while still
unseeded.

     Horizon Technology is another promising provider of software-only MPEG
playback technology with its TrueMotion-S. The company also has a multimedia
authoring package (Open! Info Manager) that facilitates the making of
multimedia presentations that include motion video. Sirius' Motion Pixels
technology was yet another impressive demonstration of software-only playback
of highly compressed video files, though not MPEG files. Beyond playback
quality, the crucial issues for developers will be the licensing arrangement
and the performance at the compression stage. We shall see a lot of CD-ROMs on
a lot of Pentium PCs with much better video than in 1995.

     It is too early to predict what will happen this year with the proposed
Zoomed Video Port (ZV Port) standard, which would allow transfer of
full-motion, full-screen video with minimal CPU utilization, through a new PC
Card (the card earlier known as PCMCIA). It sounds amazing but I'll believe it
(and report about it) when I see it.

WHAT MAY NOT FLY IN 1996

     There were a couple of announcements of products that may not be
available in volume in 1996 or that may not have a sizable market. Intel's
Pentium Pro is unlikely to have wide appeal. That's the new name for the
processor that has been mentioned until now as the P6. It is a bad name. Not
because I would prefer "Sextium," but because users will be confused,
especially as both the Pentium and Pentium Pro line will have a 150- and
166-MHz product. It also gives the impression that the Pentium itself is not
for the pros. At that high speed, it certainly is.

     The PowerPC has been depicted for nearly two years as the Promised Land
for those who want to use both Mac and DOS/Windows products on the same
computer, and it was characterized as a perfect cooperation among Apple, IBM,
and Motorola. While Apple has indeed come out with PowerPC-based systems, IBM
had no desktop computer featuring this processor, and you could not run IBM
applications on the Macs equipped with PowerPC chip. At COMDEX there was again
a pavilion dedicated to PowerPC, and it wasn't only birds chirping the new
magic word CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform). But I doubt that we
shall see any such desktop computers this year that will run both Mac and IBM
applications without third-party emulation software.

     Of course the big question for multimedia users is whether high density
or super-density ROMs of several gigabytes capacity will steamroll the
680-megabyte CD-ROMs of today. I saw the impressive prototypes; I saw the
joint communique from the formerly warring Sony/Philips and
Toshiba/Time-Warner teams (and their own brochures), but I'd bet my computer
that the super-density drives will not be shipping in 1996.

     In the meantime, we were able to witness at COMDEX how good old CD-ROM
technology keeps improving. As this is an issue not only for multimedia but
also for non-multimedia CD-ROM applications (and because I'm running out of
space), I'll discuss CD-ROM drive developments in this month's CD-ROM
Commentaries column (page 26).

     Las Vegas may have gotten cleaner than it was in the 70s as depicted by
Scorsese in his current movie, "Casino." While it still is unlikely to hit the
Boy Scouts' list of recommended places to visit, it is the perfect place for
COMDEX, and especially for the show's multimedia exhibits. Sometimes I had to
pause and remember whether I was in a casino on the Strip or in the Multimedia
Pavilion. Not a bad dilemma.


[The following sidebar is included in the article.]

                     CD Plus May Turn Out to Be CD Minus

          The CD Plus solution has been heralded for a year as the panacea for
     the problems of playing back music on an audio CD player from CD-ROMs
     that have both computer files and audio CD files--without damaging your
     speakers or your ears with white noise as the audio CD player tries to
     play back a computer file. Users are warned to skip the first track where
     the multimedia file resides, but users don't always pay attention. Many
     just toss in the CD-ROM and press the play button.

          In the CD Plus format, the audio CD file is on the first track,
     followed by a gap and then by the computer file. Sensing the gap, the
     audio CD player stops, but the CD-ROM reader can get to the computer
     file. The September issue of "Computer Life" magazine depicted such a
     wonderful, fairy-tale scenario about CD Plus that I could hardly wait to
     get my hands on a CD Plus-format disc. There were none available, so I
     held my breath and waited for COMDEX.

          It seemed to me to be absurd that while the CD Plus format was
     endorsed not only by the Recording Industry Association of America but by
     Sony and Philips, Sony had none available at that time, and at its booth
     Philips showed upcoming titles in every format except CD Plus. Well, it
     turns out that you will not be able to use titles in CD Plus format if
     you have--among others--a NEC or a Toshiba drive manufactured before
     August 1995. Chances are good that you do, as these drives have been
     best-sellers, sold in the hundreds of thousands not only directly to you
     but to PC manufacturers (as OEM products) who built these drives into
     their computers. And don't forget multimedia kit manufacturers who bundle
     sound boards with CD-ROM players.

          When I finally got my first CD Plus title ("Bob Dylan's Greatest
     Hits," from Sony), I was less than pleased to see that there was no
     warning about the fatal incompatibilities. The outside label  tells you
     that you need a 486SX 25-MHz or faster system, 8 MB of RAM, Windows 3.1
     or higher, 640X480 resolution, 256 colors (8 bit), double-speed or faster
     multisession CD-ROM drive and 8-bit sound card. In other words,
     single-speed, single-session drive owners need not apply. That's all.

          Only when you open the box at home will you find the following
     ominous sentences in the user booklet: " . . . certain CD-ROM drives may
     not properly recognize CD Plus discs. With [the enclosed] Corel drivers
     for Enhanced CD, you may be able to upgrade your CD-ROM drive to make it
     CD Plus compatible." But for many drives, this upgrade does not help.

          Sony's way of dealing with the incompatibility problem was to put no
     outside warning label alerting consumers to it, because users would not
     know whether their machines were affected, since most PCs have OEM
     drives. This is neither a heart-warming attitude nor a convincing
     argument. Hundreds of thousands of users have CD-ROMs that are clearly
     labeled by the NEC or Toshiba logo. Even in the case of OEM drives, users
     could often find out from the CONFIG.SYS file if they have drive that is
     not CD Plus compatible. Sony could have attached on a floppy the Corel
     CD-ROM Advisor program (included inside the package on a separate CD). It
     could have been made available from Sony's Internet site to let potential
     customers check whether their drives were capable of recognizing a CD
     Plus format disc.

          As I was fiddling with the installation, I bumped into a file that,
     although in a proprietary format (presumably to be used by the Corel
     Advisor program), was easily deciphered. Having snooped around in this
     file, let me do what Sony should have done by advising you about the
     brands and models of those multisession and double-speed or faster CD-ROM
     and CD-R drives that are unlikely to appropriately handle CD Plus format
     discs: NEC CDR601; Multispin 4x Pro, CDR510, and Multispin 74-1; TEAC
     CD-50; Plextor DM-XX24K; Aiwa ACD-300; Hitachi CDR-6750 and CDR 37-50;
     Reno CD-ROMX2A; Yamaha CDR100; and Ricoh RO1060C. These latter two are
     recorders/players. The Toshiba XM3501 and XM-3601 are likely to skip on
     audio, rendering them useless.

          The fatal incompatibility problem and Sony's attitude are likely to
     spoil the (post-) Christmas spirit and will dampen the enthusiasm of the
     public not only for the CD Plus format but for the entire enhanced CD
     concept. Not long ago, MediaVision went bankrupt over its sound card's
     incompatibility problems and its attitude toward handling of returns.
     Disney burnt its fingers with the bug-ridden CD-ROM release of "The Lion
     King" a year ago. Intel was grilled for shipping processor chips that
     calculated incorrectly in some situations and paid dearly for not
     advising customers sincerely.

          Sony will lose some of its credibility, and cooling down disgruntled
     customers and CD Plus distributors will cost Sony more than spelling out
     specifically the limitations of the CD Plus titles would have done.

INTERNET WAVES: THE INDESTRUCTIBLE, INDISPENSABLE INTERNET

     By Shirley Duglin Kennedy

     The Internet, a technological child of the Cold War era, was originally
designed as a Department of Defense communication network that could withstand
a nuclear attack. Specifically, if a portion of the network was decimated by
The Bomb, data packets could be rerouted, so communication would not be
totally disrupted. This explains why an ailing computer or router in Atlanta,
for instance, does not bring the entire Net to its knees--although data
"traffic" to that part of the world may be somewhat slower.

     This efficient design and function are aspects that make the Internet so
valuable in today's global economy. As information professionals, most of us
have eagerly embraced the Internet as a multifaceted tool, using it for
information retrieval, networking, and communications. Scientists and
researchers, of course, were using the Net long before most of us realized
that it even existed. These days, a staggering range of folks are using the
Net to ply their trade or practice their profession.

SOMEBODY'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR SAFETY AND SURVIVAL

     The reliability of the Internet's distributed structure makes it ideal
for disaster planning and emergency management. The Natural Hazards Research
and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder
has done a great deal of work in this area, and you can see the results on its
home page, at http://adder.colorado.edu/~hazctr/Home.html. Among the things
you'll find here is the full text of all session summaries from the Hazards
Research and Applications Workshop held in Boulder last summer. Many of the
sites listed below were mentioned in the Hazards Center's bimonthly
publication, "Natural Hazards Observer." Subscriptions are free to subscribers
within the U.S.--as are subscriptions to the online publication, "Disaster
Research." Send e-mail to hazctr@spot.colorado.edu for information.

     As you might expect, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)
home page, at http://www.fema.gov/fema/index.html, is one of the best
clearinghouses for emergency management information on the Internet. One of
FEMA's most popular publications, "The Emergency Guide for Business and
Industry," can be found at http://www.fema.gov/fema/bizindex.html.

     The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a Web site
(http://www.icrc.ch) that provides a wide range of information on civil
conflict, disasters, disaster victims, and the ICRC's role in dealing with
these problems. You'll find press releases, fact sheets, in-depth articles,
illustrated brochures, position papers, texts of various treaties and other
publications, as well as links to other Red Cross/Red Crescent organization
Web sites.

     The Natural Disaster Reference Database home page
(http://ltpwww.gsfc.nasa.gov/ndrd-cgi/ndrd), constructed by the Earth Sciences
Directorate of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, contains bibliographic
information on research results and programs related to the use of satellite
remote sensing for disaster mitigation.

     The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's National Drought Mitigation Center
offers an electronic clearinghouse of the latest scientific and technical
information on drought at http://enso.unl.edu/ndmc.

     A free, 70-page publication entitled "Emergency Preparedness Guidelines
for Mass, Crowd-Intensive Events," is available from Emergency Preparedness
Canada (EPC). Request this via e-mail to cominfo@jackson.epc.epc-pcc.x400.gc.
ca. Check out other publications available from EPC at http://hoshi.cic.sfu.
ca/~epc/.

     The National Institute for Urban Search and Rescue home page
(http://niusr.org/~usar) provides copies of its newsletter, a compendium of
seismic information sites on the Net, and earthquake preparedness information
for child safety.

     The Los Angeles bureau of "The Economist" magazine has set up a site that

STRICTLY BUSINESS

     Stop! Don't trash that fax machine! A recent survey of Fortune 500
companies by Gallup/Pitney Bowes found that firms with e-mail capabilities
send just as many faxes as firms without e-mail. Also, the poll found that
faxes were preferred over e-mail, voice mail, or overnight delivery service
for a quick answer.

     As for smaller businesses, only 21 percent of their owners with awareness
of the Internet were actually using it, according to a Gallup/MCI survey.
Thirty-five percent said it was too expensive; 35 percent said the technology
was too complex, and 46 percent admitted they were "cyberphobic."

     Business misuse of the Internet is another issue entirely. Recently,
Virgin Atlantic Airways (U.K.) was fined $14,000 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) for placing a "misleading" fare ad on the Internet.
According to the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" (11/22/95), this was the first
time DOT had fined an airline for information posted on the Net.

     "The Internetwork Mail Guide," which details methods of sending
electronic mail from one network to another, has long been one of the most
useful documents on the Internet. Provided by Scott Yanoff, the recently
updated version is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.csd.uwm.
edu/pub/internetwork-mail-guide. A Web-based version is available at

8(a) certified government contracting firms, and an "interactive yellow
pages," which helps locate experts in various fields to provide assistance in
federal government contracting.

ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING DILEMMA

     According to an article in the 11/17/95 issue of the "Chronicle of Higher
Education," researchers whose work is published online before it comes out in
print are trimming valuable weeks off the one-year limitation they have if
they wish to file a patent on their findings. Some journals are in the
practice of running abstracts--or entire articles--online weeks before the
hard copy becomes available. And papers are often posted on a Web site prior
to a conference where their findings will be announced. While the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office  hasn't issued an official ruling on "electronic
disclosure," a spokesman indicated that patent lawyers should assume that
anything available online should be considered "published."

CREDIT CARD SECURITY RISK UPDATE

     Is the widespread fear of sending a credit card number over the Internet
justified? Not when you consider the alternatives, concluded Peter H. Lewis,
a "New York Times" reporter who addressed the subject in an article last
November. "Sending a credit card number over the Internet to an electronic
merchant is probably the safest way to make such a transaction," Lewis wrote.
"In the last week, for example, I handed my credit card to a waiter who
disappeared with it for five minutes. I faxed my credit card information to a
business in New Jersey, and the fax probably lay exposed to everyone in that
office for hours and perhaps to the cleaning crew that night. I called a hotel
and gave my credit card data to a reservation clerk and continued my
recklessness by ordering some merchandise from a clothing catalog, again by
reading my credit card information to some unseen operator. . . . Compared
with the risk of handing my credit card to a stranger, which I do nearly every
day, sending it over the Internet is pretty secure."

INTERNET INSIGHTS: SEARCHING OUT AND ASSESSING WEB SITES

     By Paul Blake

     [Editor's Note: This marks the first round of Paul Blake's new bimonthly
column, Internet Insights. As a London-based writer/editor for Learned
Information  Europe Ltd., Paul has written IT's European Report column for
some time. Recently he changed his focus at Learned to concentrate more on the
Internet. In his new column, he will discuss the dynamic happenings on the Net
in the context of the information industry and give publishers, information
professionals, and information users insights into how they can exploit this
new medium.]

     There have been a welter of recent developments aimed at making searching
the Internet easier and more precise. While it is probably overly optimistic
to claim that the difficulties of finding information on the Net have
disappeared, the latest enhancements to search engines, such as Yahoo!, Lycos,
and Open Text, amount to a significant step in the right direction.

     One of the most impressive new entrants comes from IBM, which has teamed
up with Ontario-based Open Text Corp. to launch a World Wide Web-based search
service that retrieves data both from Web pages and from information providers
such as Disclosure, Information Access Company, and Cambridge Scientific
Abstracts.

INFOMARKET SEARCH

     Called the infoMarket Search service, it lets users search multiple
databases simultaneously across the Net. Users are able to search sources
through a single interface, with infoMarket Search able to access text and
multimedia data and then merge results together. The service was free of
charge to users at the time this column was written, though charges will be
announced early in 1996.

     According to Open Text, its retrieval engine is unique in being able to
search millions of Web pages in under five seconds and for its understanding
of the structure of documents found on the WWW. Open Text's technology uses
automated "crawlers" to index the complete text of Web documents. These index
every word on every page, as well as recording the structural context of each
indexed string. They constantly search for new documents to index and revisit
sites frequently to add to the master index.

     At launch, the sources accessible via infoMarket Search are Yahoo!, the
Open Text Index of Web documents, the content of 13,000 Usenet newsgroups, and
the McKinley listing of rated sites on the Internet. In the latter case,
Internet resources have been reviewed and evaluated by research specialists
and McKinley's editorial advisory boards for content, currency, organization
of the resource, ease of use, and accessibility. According to IBM,
negotiations are under way with a variety of other content providers, ranging
from "news services to digital libraries and image databases."

     IBM says that publishers with content distributed among different
platforms or locations will be able to use infoMarket Search to create
tailored "virtual services" for their customers. Users will also be able to
install infoMarket agents to enable them to search internal and external
sources through one interface. "The aim of the infoMarket service is to enable
end users to enter a single query that is capable of interrogating nearly all
of the common database formats, supports numerous search engines, and delivers
content to  the predominant end-user platforms," explained Jeff Crigler, vice
president of IBM infoMarket. "The service can also be modified to meet users'
particular requirements or systems."

YAHOO! AND OPEN TEXT

     Open Text is also involved in a move to add a search capability to
Yahoo!, one of the Web's most comprehensive subject guides. Yahoo!, which
catalogs Web pages according to subject headings, now also offers the ability
to search its entries using the Open Text retrieval engine.

     Using Open Text, Yahoo! users will be able to conduct searches for
specific words and phrases, multilevel Boolean searches, as well as weighted
searches. Inquiries can be narrowed to specific categories in Yahoo!'s
hierarchical index, and users will also be able to use structural operators
such as document title, sub-headings, body copy, and footnotes as qualifiers
for their searches. Additionally, Open Text will offer the ability to retrieve
documents "similar" to those a user has already found.

     "The Open Text technology expands Yahoo! with a 'back of the book'
word-by-word index of the Internet, which complements our 'front of the book'
hierarchical index," said Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo!. "This will boost
the efficiency and productivity of both browsing and more serious searching on
Yahoo!, and broaden its appeal to a wider range of Internet users."

LYCOS SPIDER

     One of Yahoo!'s rivals, the Lycos Spider, has not been sitting still
either. It has a fresh interface, along with support for HotJava and
"backlinks"--which let users who have clicked to Lycos from another site
return directly to the original site by clicking on an icon on the Lycos
search screen. A new search form lets users set display options, such as to
one-line summaries, or for hits that are "loosely matched" or "very strongly
matched."

     Lycos has also added reviews of the top 5 percent World Wide Web
sites--graded for content, presentation, and the "experience" of accessing
them. As part of a $3 million acquisition of Point Communications Corp., the
Lycos search engine has integrated Point's review and rating guide to the Web.
After carrying out a search of the Web, the user will be able to view the
search results from the Lycos catalog, together with ratings of sites
retrieved.

     A team of about 30 Point reviewers employs a 50-point scale to rate Web
sites for content, as well as for presentation and the experience of using the
site, defined as whether the site is worth the time, and whether the user
would recommend it to others. Web sites landing in the top 5 percent are
awarded Badges of Excellence. Current holders include the Global Health
Network, Mobil Oil, and Lucas Arts.

     The Lycos Web site has also integrated Point Communications' Point Now
service, which provides brief items of business news, stocks, and weather,
with hotlinks to CNN and other news sources. Lycos itself was launched last
June as a commercial avenue for the Spider search technology first developed
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Eight million sites, or 91 percent of the
Web, are indexed by the service.

WEBCOMPASS

     Established software vendors are also getting in on the Web searching
act. Quarterdeck has unveiled software that allows users to send a single
query to multiple Web search engines, then receive a summary of results
including subtopics. Using WebCompass, searchers can also automatically update
results, store them locally on the PC, and assign rankings to them.

     When a user enters a query or topic of interest, WebCompass polls
multiple search engines, such as Lycos and InfoSeek, for relevant Web pages.
The content of these pages is summarized and presented to the user. When there
are a large number of results, WebCompass automatically groups the summarized
pages into subtopics, giving the user the option to drill down on specific
topics.

     WebCompass also lets users build a personalized index of topics that they
are interested in and store retrieved data in a database based in the
Microsoft Access 2.0 file format. The software can be set to perform regularly
scheduled queries on selected Web sites to update existing information in the
database. The user can additionally assign a rating system, from one to five,
for the importance of topics and subtopics, which the WebCompass search engine
will use in the future to sort data during updates.

     "The idea behind WebCompass is to let the user multiply the power of the
many Web search engines available by performing one search from his or her PC.
We hope it will greatly reduce the time people must spend searching and
analyzing the data available on all of the search engines on the Internet,"
said Emerick Woods, vice president and general manager of the Internet
business unit at Quarterdeck.

     WebCompass, Personal Edition, which will cost under $100, works with any
Web browser and runs on a 486-based PC with a minimum of 8 megabytes of
memory, with 16 megabytes recommended.

BOOK REVIEW: THE COMPLETE INTERNET COMPANION FOR LIBRARIANS


     by Allen C. Benson
     Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., 1995
     ISBN: 1-55570-178-7 (softcover)
     407 pages, $49.95

     Reviewed by Virginia Gatcheff Gehrig

     If a library can only buy one book to learn about the Internet, "The
Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is the book to buy. This
comprehensive book covers all aspects of the Internet, from hardware
requirements to training staff members. Benson's text is easy to read and is
geared for those new to the online world. Yet, experienced Internet surfers
will not be bored. His specific audience is "librarians who are responsible
for planning and setting up their organization's computer system." Those
involved in online reference services or anyone who exchanges information over
the Internet will also benefit from this book.

     "The Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is divided into six
parts. Part One, "Overview of the Internet," describes the Internet for
newcomers and explains what hardware and software is required to gain access
to the "information superhighway." A list of national Internet service
providers is included.

     Part Two, "Tools and Protocols," describes in detail how to use the three
main communications services of the Internet: ftp (file transfer protocol),
telnet, and e-mail. Part Three, "Search Utilities and the Client/Server
Model," focuses on resource discovery tools such as Archie, WAIS (Wide Area
Information Servers), World Wide Web browsers, and gophers.

     Part Four, "General Resources," gives a broad overview of the types of
information services available on the Internet such as listserv discussion
lists, Campus-Wide Information Systems, and Usenet newsgroups. Part Five,
"Integrating the Internet into Traditional Library Services," focuses
exclusively on how a library can use the Internet effectively. This section is
explained in more detail below. Part Six, "Internet Resources Arranged by
Subject A-Z," is a selective list of Internet services and resources.

     Chapter 21, "The Librarian's Role in Implementing Internet," gives
practical advice for the librarians assigned to the task of establishing the
Internet in the library's environment. A significant portion of the chapter is
devoted to training, and examples in the books can be used during training
sessions. The chapter also gives ample training outlines and suggested
content. Benson also discusses the issues of copyright and digital information
and how portions of copyright law apply to libraries and computer systems. The
chapter includes a recommended Internet use policy and tips on how to use
public relations to garner community support of the Internet in the library.
Sample community demonstrations are included for adult services, youth
services, high school, and college students. Most helpful may be the section
on how to integrate the Internet into existing services and how to add value
to Internet services. The chapter closes with some profiles on how librarians
are becoming involved in online publishing with such efforts as local history
archives and locating and repackaging information.

     Chapter 22, "Implementing Internet Service In-House," takes the Internet
beyond the reference room and provides ideas for using the Internet throughout
the library. This chapter shows how the Internet can be used in technical
services, acquisitions, and collection development.

     Chapter 23, "Reference Services," returns to the reference room and
details how to effectively use the Internet in answering the three most common
types of reference questions: author/title questions, fact-finding questions,
and subject questions. Benson discusses the problems associated with locating
and accessing information, primarily the Internet's tremendous size and vast
resources. He offers some time- and trouble-saving tips for searching
efficiently and introduces the reader to Infopop. (Infopop is a Windows-based
application that allows users to create their own indexes on Internet
resources.)

     Examples are used extensively throughout the entire book. In several
places, exercises are included to encourage the reader to become familiar with
the Internet and how it works. "The Complete Internet Companion for
Librarians" also includes a list of library-related discussion lists and tells
how to subscribe to them. Benson's book is a valuable resource for librarians
implementing the Internet. Its specific focus on the library's use of the
Internet makes it preferable to other general reference books.

FASTER AUTHORING SYSTEMS AND DISC DRIVES

     Like many other things in our technologically advancing society, CD-ROM
capabilities are constantly "new and improved." Here are two examples: a
high-speed authoring system and a faster CD-ROM drive.

DATA/WARE'S HIGH-SPEED CD-AUTHORING SYSTEM

     Data/Ware Development has released its Server Enterprise Authoring System
(S/EAS), a high-speed CD-authoring system. S/EAS is the latest addition to
Data/Ware Development's line of optical storage and CD-authoring systems. Like
the Enterprise Authoring System (EAS) from which it is derived, S/EAS includes
all of the hardware and software required to author CDs in an automated,
lights-out environment.

     According to Dale Smith, vice president of new product development for
Data/Ware, large organizations in fields ranging from banking and insurance to
telecommunications and government are turning to data distribution by CD as a
cost-effective alternative to COM or paper. "In addition to reducing the
expenses associated with producing, distributing, and storing COM and paper
documents," said Smith, "CDs make it fast and easy to access data. The result
is improved productivity and customer service."

     S/EAS requires no mainframe processing to produce CDs. Instead, a
UNIX-based SPARCserver handles all pre-processing and processing steps.

     S/EAS accepts data or images from 3480/3490 tape cartridges, a LAN/WAN,
or a mainframe. After data or images are downloaded to S/EAS, custom software
prepares it for recording to CDs and also extracts indexes from reports as
required. After the pre-processing phase is finished, S/EAS masters the data
to make it conform to the ISO 9660 standard for recording and reading data on
CDs. S/EAS can operate multiple 2x or 6x CD writers simultaneously and can be
equipped with robotic feeders. Each feeder can hold 75 CDs, enough to last an
entire production shift.

     To view data, end users simply insert a S/EAS CD into a standard CD-ROM
drive in any PCrunning Windows.In addition to rapid data access, users can cut
and paste data to other PC applications such as word processors, databases,
and spreadsheets. They can also print and fax on demand.

     For more information, contact Data/Ware Development, Inc., San Diego, CA,

TOSHIBA'S 6.7 SPEED CD-ROM DRIVE

     Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Disk Products Division (TAIS
DPD) has announced the XM-3701 Series of 6.7-speed CD-ROM drives that support
a 1,000 KB/sec. data transfer rate.

     "Toshiba's new XM-3701 Series drives meet the needs of OEMs, VAD/VARs,
and distributors who need to provide cutting-edge performance and high-quality
drives to their customers today," said Jerry Higgins, vice president of
product marketing, CD-ROM, TAIS DPD. "These new drives with their 1,000
KB/sec. sustained data transfer rate and 120 ms random seek time provide
CD-ROM users with the performance necessary to support smooth full-motion
video and complex high-end graphics transfers from CD-ROMs."

     The new XM-3701 Series' fast rotational speed of 6.7x was achieved
through enhanced error correction, employment of a digital signal processor,
and an improved optical pick-up head and spindle motor. In addition to the
6.7x rotational speed, the drives also support rotations of 1x and 2x.

     The XM-3701 CD-ROM drives employ the variable speed playback system used
in previous Toshiba CD-ROM drives. The variable-speed playback system allows
the drive to read data before the disk reaches a specific rotational speed of
1, 2, or 6.7 times standard rotational speeds. As a result, the CD-ROM drive
provides improved drive read times. The variable-speed playback also decreases
power consumption to 5.9 watts average.

     The low-mass optical pick-up and digital servo control featured in the
XM-3701 drives ensure fast access to complex data, video, and audio files
located anywhere on the disc. The digital servo control provides greater
tracking precision and head position, ultimately giving the drives their 120
ms random seek time.

     The XM-3701 Series drives comply with MPC-3 and-2 specifications and are
compatible with Kodak multi-session Photo-CD and CD-Plus, red book, yellow
book, and CD-ROM XA. The drives are also CD-Bridge, CD-i, and CD-i Ready
compatible and can be used as a CD-Audio player, independent of the computer
system.

     The XM-3701 Series drives feature a sealed enclosure that maintains a
contamination-free environment for data integrity. The result is a high MTBF
of 100,000 hours. The SCSI-2 interface XM-3701 Series drives support CD-DA
transfers over the SCSI bus for maximum bandwidth utilization and feature a
256 KB data buffer.

     The drives may be mounted horizontally or vertically for user
flexibility. The tray-type electrical disc loader eliminates the need for a
caddy, and the drives feature a media removal prevention function. The XM-3701
Series drives are available in internal and external models. The XM-3701B
internal drive has a suggested list price of $415, and the TXM-3701D external
drive has a suggested list price of $515.

     The TAIS Disk Products Division markets a wide range of industry-standard
Winchester and CD-ROM disk drives. For additional product information, contact
Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Disk Products Division, Irvine, CA,
714/457-0777.

BUSINESS&INDUSTRY DATABASE NOW ON CD-ROM

     Responsive Database Services, Inc. (RDS) has announced that its
innovative Business&Industry (B&I) online database is now available on CD-ROM.

     Designed to meet the needs of professional, novice, and occasional
researchers, "B&I on CD-ROM" enables easy and precise retrieval of facts,
figures, key events, rankings, industry overviews, and trends dealing with
companies, industries, markets, and products throughout the world.

     "B&I on CD-ROM" delivers full-text articles, informative abstracts, and
thousands of numerical tables from over 600 leading trade magazines,
newsletters, business publications, regional newspapers, and international
business dailies from 30 countries.

     According to RDS, since "B&I" offers both professional search software
and Easy Menu Search software (for DOS and Macintosh platforms), users of all
experience levels will find it useful. In public and academic libraries, "B&I"
can be a powerful research tool for students and faculty as well as for
salespeople, personal investors, job seekers, and non-profit development
offices gathering information on companies or industries. In corporate use,
"B&I on CD-ROM" can serve as a cost-effective supplement to online searches
and also enable employees to retrieve information when library staff is
unavailable.

     "`B&I on CD-ROM' embodies many of the features, improvements, and
benefits that users of business information files are asking for," said Dick
Harris, president of RDS. "In today's searching environment, time,
cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and good results are especially important."

     All records included in "B&I"--which is available online as DIALOG File
9 and DataStar BIDB--are indexed at a detailed level to assure precise
retrieval. Each record has an enhanced title that describes the article's
content. Original articles published in languages other than English include
an enhanced title and an informative abstract in English.

     "B&I's" indexing terms and search codes are based on common-use business
terminology. With its "controlled vocabulary" terms, searchers use
natural-language words and phrases such as market size, market share, industry
forecasts, company overview, market testing, product introduction, mergers and
acquisitions, joint venture, trends, demographics, African-American market,
Generation X market, green market, cooperative campaigns, cobranding, umbrella
marketing, and more.

     "B&I" enables users to search arrays of product codes by utilizing
industry names, thus eliminating the need to select or input product codes. In
addition with DIALOGLink, "B&I on CD-ROM" will automatically extend searches
by dialing out and logging on to "B&I's" online service.

     The "B&I CD-ROM" includes approximately 300,000 records--the full
database as it appears online for the most recent 15 months. The annual
subscription price is $3,995, and the public and academic library subscription
price is $2,400.

     For more information, contact Responsive Database Services, Inc.,
800/313-2212 (or Europe 44-181-302-5101), e-mail: rdsmail@ix.netcom.com, or

THREE NEW DISCS FROM GALE

     Gale Research has recently announced these three new products:

EASY ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS

     Financial consultants, brokers, and market researchers can get fast
access to SEC reports for nearly 900 of the top 1,000 companies with "Gale's
SEC Connection," a new CD-ROM business resource.

     Individual entries can be accessed via a menu of six search criteria:
company name, industry, SIC code, city, state, and/or ZIP code of the
company's headquarters. One or more criteria can be selected for broad or
narrow searches that will lead the user to the report(s) sought.

     Each report may include (but is not limited to) information on marketing
strategy, financial information, legal proceedings involving the company,
properties held, insurance, income taxes, executive officers and directors,
subsidiaries, and products the company manufactures or sells.

     Users can access information by company name, industry, SIC code, city,
state, or ZIP code; can "jump" to major portions of the report; and can print
information or download to disc. Search function operators allow users to
combine items for customized searches.

     Minimum system requirements for the single-user version are: IBM or
compatible PC with 80286 processor (80386 or faster processor recommended),
MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 3.3 or higher and MS-DOS CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX)
version 2.1 or higher, 640K bytes of RAM memory (500 K available), a hard disk
with 5 MB of free space (minimum), 16 MB for optimal speed of software, VGA
graphics card and monitor (color recommended), and an ISO 9660-compatible
CD-ROM drive with cables and interface card.

CD SPEEDS GRANT RESEARCH

     Key information on 167,000 grants from 5,227 funders is available
electronically with "Grants on Disc," new from the Taft Group, an imprint of
Gale Research.

     The annual subscription CD-ROM includes quarterly updates with
information on more than 30,000 recently awarded cash grants, or 120,000 new
grants each year.

     Powerful search functions offer quick access (via menu, hotkey, or mouse)
to detailed information on recent grant recipients, including name and
location, dollar amount of recent grants, recipient type, and grantor's
contact information, all of which can be viewed simultaneously in different
windows.

     Items within grant listings are fielded to allow searches using free text
or a combination of terms including grant amount, recipient location (city or
state), recipient ZIP code, recipient type (nine major codes plus 215
subcategories), funder location (city or state), funder ZIP code, and funder
area code.

     System requirements for "Grants on Disc" are IBM compatible 80386SX PC or
higher (486 recommended), DOS 3.3 or higher, Windows 3.1 or higher, a hard
drive with minimum of 2 MB available, 4 MB of RAM (8 MB recommended), VGA
monitor, a mouse or pointing device, and an ISO 9660 CD-ROM player.

     "Grants on Disc" is available from The Taft Group by calling
800/877-TAFT.

CAREER SEARCH GUIDANCE

     A recent Gallup poll reported that 72 percent of employed adults, if they
could plan their lives again, would try to get more information about job or
career options. Nearly one in five said they obtained their current job
through a series of random circumstances. But now people can get help with
"Gale's Career Guidance System," a new CD-ROM resource.

     Said Gale Research careers editor Linda Thurn, "You can save hours of
research time by keying in one occupation name and searching on it for
information on all aspects, rather than looking for salary data in one print
source, job descriptions in another, potential employers in another, and so
on."

     "Gale's Career Guidance System" combines profiles of more than 1,200
careers and 210,000 potential employers with background information from the
U.S. Department of Labor, allowing job hunters to identify the right career,
assess its economic outlook, then find the contact people at the companies
most likely to hire them.

     The "System's" Expanded Edition provides additional guidance by including
self-assessment tools that match personalities to appropriate careers, then
direct the user to needed training or educational programs and available
financial aid.

     The user can thoroughly explore more than 210,000 U.S. companies in the
potential employers section and can identify target employers in a number of
ways, including geographically, by SIC code, by industry group, or by the type
of occupations they employ.

     The U.S. Department of Labor's two popular publications, "Occupational
Outlook Handbook" and "Dictionary of Occupational Titles," are also included.

     Designed for use in career, employment, and outplacement agencies,
"Gale's Career Guidance System" uses either an MS-DOS or PC-DOS platform (3.3
or higher) on an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer (80286 processor
required, 80486 or faster is recommended). System requirements include 640K
bytes of RAM (520K free), a hard disk with 6 MB minimum of free space (16 for
optimal speed) and a VGA color card and monitor.

     For more information, contact Gale Research, Detroit, 800/877-GALE.

WINDOWS 95 CAN WAIT

     Of the 16,752 total worldwide CD-ROM titles in print at the end of 1995,
only 1.2 percent will be Windows 95 native, according to a survey by the
Woodstock, Vermont-based market research firm InfoTech, Inc. Windows 95 native
CD-ROMs will total 204 worldwide for 1995, and 55 percent of these offer new
content.

     Consumer CD-ROM publishers are embracing the new OS more eagerly than
inhouse or institutional publishers, the survey shows.

     InfoTech forecasts that around 6 percent of total worldwide CD-ROM titles
in print will be Windows 95 native by year-end 1996. By contrast, InfoTech
projects that the Windows 95/NT 32-bit family will take over as the dominant
CD-ROM publishing platform in 1999.

     Call InfoTech at 802/763-2097.

TOP WEB SITES TO ADD INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA

     AND YOU CAN VIEW IT THROUGH "SHOCKWAVE"

     Millions of Netscape Navigator 2.0 users can now experience multimedia in
a Web page and the dynamic impact of multimedia documents for the first time.
"Shockwave for Director" brings "Director" productions--with interactive
graphics, sound, and animation--to the Internet. Web developers are using
"Shockwave" now for interactive entertainment, merchandising, advertising,
product demonstrations, and education.

     Macromedia, Inc. has announced that dozens of major Web sites are using
its "Shockwave for Director" to transform the World Wide Web from static pages
to interactive multimedia. Many of the most popular sites on the Internet are
adding high-impact multimedia productions, which can be viewed using Netscape
Navigator 2.0 with a free "Shockwave" plug-in. Now available for the first
time, the "Shockwave" plug-in can be downloaded from Macromedia's Web site
(http://www.macromedia.com).

     Web publishers who are preparing to unveil new media content include a
who's who of the Internet and multimedia worlds: CNN Online, Time Pathfinder,
CondeNet Online, 20th Century Fox, MTV Online, Turner Online, Apple Computer,
Disney's "Toy Story," Intel, USA Today Info, "Advertising Age,"  M/B
Interactive, Sony Music Entertainment, "Melrose Place," Internet Shopping
Network, American Cancer Society, @Home, On Ramp, c/net online, Clement Mok
Designs, Radical Media, Siegel & Gale, ad-hoc Interactive, and Maytag.
Cybernauts can visit Macromedia's Web site to be introduced to the multimedia
Web and for links to the first "shocked" sites showing interactive multimedia.

     "`Shockwave' is a breakthrough that brings the Internet to life," claims
Fred Sotherland, vice president, creative director of c/net: the computer
network. "Now more like television than a print medium, the Web is fun,
dynamic, and interactive. At last, the Internet has what it takes to dazzle
consumers and keep them coming back."

     "Netscape's goal is to make the Internet as open and dynamic an
environment as possible," said Marc Andreessen, founder and vice president of
technology for Netscape communications. "By working with Macromedia's
"Shockwave for Director,"  we are greatly expanding the capabilities for
communicating over the Internet by providing users with richer media and more
compelling means of expression."

     "Shockwave for Director" is targeted at graphic artists, animators, and
other creative nonprogrammers who can immediately use their multimedia skills
to create Web pages with interactive media content. Internet users will be
able to easily download compressed "Director" multimedia movies as quickly as
the typical digitized image. Since "Director" is seamlessly integrated into
the browser (and other tools), "Director" movies run immediately, at full
speed, on the user's desktop.

     To achieve these performance gains during downloads, "Shockwave for
Director" includes a post-processor called Afterburner, which compresses
"Director" files by about 60 percent and optimizes the content by media type.
"Shockwave" files are often smaller than the original static graphics on Web
sites. Support for streaming, which boosts download performance still more,
will be added to future versions of "Shockwave for Director."

     For more information on Macromedia products, call 800/326-2128,
415/252-2000, or fax 415/626-0554. You can also reach Macromedia online:

Network (MSN): GO MACROMEDIA; Internet: macropr@macromedia.com or on the World
Wide Web: http://www.macromedia.com.

MULTIMEDIA STARTER KIT FOR THE INTERNET

     Quarterdeck Corporation and Paradesa Media have announced "Larry Magid's
Essential Internet," the first multimedia Internet product available for the
World Wide Web. Aiming for true mass market distribution with over one hour of
rich multimedia content, the title is expected to have a retail price of under
$20. "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is targeted toward the large number of
new Internet users purchasing multimedia PCs.

     "The multimedia aspects of this product make it unique among a sea of
Internet starter kits that rely on books to explain and guide you through the
Internet. This not only teaches you about the Web, it takes you there," said
Michael Lerner, Paradesa Media executive director.

     The CD-ROM was designed to guide beginning users through the intricacies
of the World Wide Web. Larry Magid, syndicated columnist, best-selling author,
and experienced Net surfer, explains in basic English how the Internet works
and how to navigate through its main services. Using sound, video, and
animation, Magid combines his wealth of knowledge on personal computing and
the Internet with his ability to explain technology in the simplest of terms,
providing users with a true hands-on Internet tutorial.

     "If the World Wide Web was created to make the Internet easier to
navigate, "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is the answer to untangling what
has become a very crowded and often intimidating World Wide Web," said Emerick
Woods, Quarterdeck vice president and general manager of the Internet business
unit. "This is the first and only multimedia starter kit that not only helps
a user understand and figure out what the Web is all about by literally
walking through it and explaining it in simple terms but also will immediately
connect the user to the Web to find out for themselves."

     Magid explores some of his favorite Web sites right on the CD-ROM. If the
user is interested in learning more, he or she can simply click on a hypertext
link to connect to the Web page being discussed. "Essential Internet" is
developed in HTML to emulate a World Wide Web page. Users surf cyberspace and
learn how to link with millions of computers quickly to locate information
without the cost of being online. And when they're ready, they can investigate
how much it costs to sign up for the service and can instantly get online
using Quarterdeck's Connect & Play feature.

     "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is available at major computer retail
stores nationwide. Updates to the CD-ROM can be downloaded for free by
accessing the Larry's World Web site (http://www.larrysworld.com). The package
comes bundled with Quarterdeck Mosaic, Message Center for news and e-mail,
Connect and Play, and up to 30 days of free Internet access from NETCOM
On-Line Communications, Inc.

     For more information, contact Quarterdeck, Marina del Rey, CA,

SOFTWARE FOR CONSUMER SATISFACTION

     The Interactive Multimedia Assoc-iation (IMA), a worldwide trade
organization representing more than 380 interactive multimedia technology
providers, has officially launched an industry-wide campaign to help consumers
better match CD-ROM software titles to their personal computing systems. The
IMA's CD MATCH program is designed to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce
retail returns of multimedia titles, which are running as high as 30 percent
for some titles.

     Endorsed by a number of leading CD-ROM title publishers and retailers,
the CD MATCH campaign will provide millions of consumers with free software
that automatically runs a check of their multimedia PCs and provides a
printout of system capabilities.

     Simultaneous with the announcement of the consumer education program, the
IMA also debuted its specifications for a uniform label for CD-ROM titles. The
program promotes a uniform labeling system for on-pack display that exactly
matches the format and type of information on the CD MATCH printout. Combined,
these two elements will enable consumers to make more informed CD-ROM title
purchasing decisions, improve user satisfaction levels, and reduce returns.

     The IMA CD MATCH software is available at no charge through the
association's home page on the World Wide Web (ftp://ftp.ima.org/pub/cdmatch).
The free software will also be available to consumers via magazine bundles and
companion packs in early 1996. For more information, contact the IMA at
cdmatch@ima.org.

MULTIMEDIA FRONTIERS

     If you're really interested in multimedia technology, read on: Here are
examples of some of the more interesting uses that we've heard of. The four
applications described below may not be what you would use in your library,
but they do represent new frontiers. If you learn about multimedia and know
where it's headed, you'll understand what effects it may have on your
environment in the future.

AN INTERNET-LINKED MONTHLY CD

     "Multimedia World," a publication for multimedia enthusiasts, and
CompuServe have joined forces to produce the first monthly CD-ROM magazine
with hyperlinks to the Internet and to an online service. "Multimedia World"
is distributing this special edition of its CD-ROM companion "Multimedia World
LIVE!" with every newsstand copy, at a cover price of $4.95.

     The customized version of "LIVE!" incorporates numerous hyperlinks to
both the CompuServe Information Service and the World Wide Web using
CompuServe's interface software. By selecting one of these hyperlinks, "LIVE!"
users then may launch directly to related sites either on the CompuServe
Information Service or on the Web, such as "Multimedia World's" home page at
http://www.mmworld.com.

     "`LIVE's' seamless integration of online hyperlinks represents a new and
dynamic way for our readers to access the information they want," said Russell
Glitman, editorial director of "Multimedia World." "If readers are interested
in more background on a certain topic, a link can connect them immediately to
additional editorial content that resides online."

     The November issue of "LIVE!" contained linked articles on "Multimedia
World's" cover story for that month and an interactive test report of video
cards, CD-ROM drives, and multimedia systems. In these interactive reports,
users rank their own criteria to generate results customized to their personal
preferences.

     "LIVE!" will also include a selection of games, utilities, clip media,
and drivers, as well as links to popular online software libraries.
"Multimedia World" has reserved 200 megabytes on "LIVE!"  for interactive
advertising, software demos, and hyperlinks to Web sites.

     "`Multimedia World LIVE!' is a natural extension of our mission--to reach
and inform the mediaphile," explained Greg Mason, publisher of "Multimedia
World."

     Multimedia World is privately held and published in San Francisco by PC
World Communications, a subsidiary of International Data Group. For more
information, contact Scott Laughlin of PC World Communications, 415/978-3329.

A 24-HOUR ENTERTAINMENT CHANNEL ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB

     Online entertainment developer and consumer Internet access provider Only
Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. has launched its OMI Channel, featuring
original programs and live entertainment.

     The first programming concept of its kind to be implemented on the World
Wide Web, the company claims, the OMI Channel is accessible at
http://www.only.com and features a complete slate of regularly scheduled
original entertainment, comedy, news, drama, and lifestyle programming.

     "As a national Internet service provider and developer of original World
Wide Web entertainment, the OMI Channel will allow us to leverage our
resources and present the online industry with a business model that makes a
lot of sense," said John K. Sloatman, president of Only Multimedia & The Wave
Network, Inc.

     Among the many original and light-hearted OMI Channel programs are "Only
Soap," an episodic soap opera complete with sex, romance, murder, and
intrigue; "Frankly Zappa," which takes viewers into the streets of Los Angeles
in search of Frank; and OMI's own versions of an exercise program, morning
news, daytime talk, and entertainment coverage. OMI is accepting third-party
program proposals.

     The OMI Channel will also feature a strong music industry presence,
including several radio stations, each with their own unique domain and online
programming schedules. The company has already brought a visual aspect to
radio; it has created the Jimi Hendrix Foundation home page and has produced
several live concerts.

     Only Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. says it is the first company to
use a fleet of multimedia vans to cover live events on the World Wide Web in
real time using photos, video, and live text, a feature that will be called
upon extensively in daily OMI Channel programming.

     For more information about Only Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. and
the OMI Channel, contact Kathryn Thyne at 818/753-0037 or visit the Web sites
at http://www.wavenet.com and http://www.only.com.

A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR PHOTO-REALISTIC MULTIMEDIA

     A new multimedia production company has introduced a new multimedia
technology that combines photo-realistic backgrounds with live actor
animations to produce more detail than normal 3-D images.

     Two experts in multimedia production and publishing have formed a new
multimedia production house called The Armchair Travel Company, Ltd. It has
been co-founded by William Donelson, who spent 10 years with the Media Lab at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and William Beckett,
who has many years of experience with leading U.K. multimedia publishing
companies, including Virgin Interactive Entertainment. The new technology,
called Virtual Travel, was debuted in the company's first CD-ROM game, a
murder mystery called "Foul Play--Mystery At Awkward Manor."

     Virtual Travel uses special photographic techniques and computer software
to simulate the experience of walking through an environment and turning
around to examine it from all angles. The technique uses still frames which
are then made into movie walkways and panoramas. Virtual Travel can use
software specifically developed by Armchair Travel when it is necessary for
animations of live actors to be inserted into the panoramas. Alternatively, it
can use Apple's QuickTimeVR, which has other advantages but does not currently
offer superimposition of animations.

     "Photographic imagery can provide infinitely more detail than even the
most carefully rendered 3D imagery," asserted Donelson, who first conceived of
the Virtual Travel technology in the mid-1970s while working at MIT.

     "The excellent quality achievable using these techniques, combined with
the fast postproduction of Apple's QuickTimeVR technology, is set to
revolutionize the creation of background imagery in multimedia software,"
Donelson said. "You can soon expect to see high-quality interactive tours of
fascinating locations around the world, as well as the innovative use of these
techniques in games."

     Beckett, who has produced multimedia titles that have won British,
American, and European awards, is directing the new company's marketing
efforts.

     The Armchair Travel Company has worked closely with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Apple Computer on the innovative use of
Virtual Travel. Besides its West London office, the company has a
manufacturing and sales base in Memphis.

AUTO-GRAPHICS' IMPACT/ONLINE GETS TEXAS SCHOOL LIBRARIES CONNECTED

     The Texas Education Agency (TEA) is implementing a statewide technology
initiative known as the Texas Library Connection (TLC). Through this
initiative, it will provide current, relevant information to all citizens of
its school communities regardless of geographic location or district size.
Based on input from the library community, the Instructional Technology
Division of TEA will work with Auto-Graphics Inc. of Pomona, California, to
implement two related information resources projects through this initiative.

     The first resource to be developed identifies the actual, physical
location of books, audio and video tapes, computer software, filmstrips, and
other audio-visual resources by merging all the electronic records of school
library resources into one database. Until now, Texas did not have a statewide
resource-sharing database. The new database, called the TLC union catalog,
identifies the needed book or audiovisual item and points to the location of
the item at the user's local library or at any other district, regional, or
state library.

     The second resource provided by TLC is the electronic full text of
magazines, journals, newspapers, and other informational databases that can be
accessed remotely. Students searching for subjects in these databases will
find the entire magazine or newspaper article about that subject, rather than
simply a citation referring to an article in a newspaper or magazine that may
or may not be available in the student's local library.

     "In order to succeed," said Anita Givens, senior director for
instructional technology, "students must learn the skills necessary to
discover and select relevant information and to use that information to
accomplish specific objectives. TLC provides Texas students with the
opportunity to learn real-world information utilization skills and with access
to an expanded world of resources."

     Students statewide will be able to access Impact/ONLINE and the TLC
database either through direct connections to the Internet or through dial-up
services provided by another state initiative, TENET, the Texas Education
NETwork. Utilizing the TEA's Internet network, TENET, which is already in
place, provided a significant cost savings to the state.

     The diverse geographical aspects of Texas have made connecting the
libraries that serve Texas' 3.6 million students in over 1,000 school
districts a challenge. Gloria McClanahan, director of library media services,
said, "One vital part of this initiative is to ensure universal information
access to students throughout the state of Texas, especially those students
who reside in remote, rural areas."

     Auto-Graphics originally made the database available through the use of
client/server software, but the company also developed a World Wide Web
location so that the database is accessible to any individual using the
Internet with any type of software and hardware. Students can simply do a
search from their school library, and if the resource is at another library,
they can request that the item be sent to their local school library by
creating an interlibrary loan request.

     "Impact/ONLINE will give the state of Texas the ability to provide
resource sharing to every school," said William Kliss, vice president of sales
and marketing at Auto-Graphics. "It will remove the walls from the school
libraries, allowing students to quickly search a much greater resource and
obtain expensive or difficult-to-find materials easily."

     Impact/ONLINE builds in ease-of-use features designed to make students
self-sufficient when accessing information. This includes user-friendly
interfaces and context-sensitive help messages. It also provides librarians
with time-saving cataloging tools for preparing books and other information
resources, enabling these materials to be easily located. Librarians will
minimize the amount of time spent identifying and cataloging material to
enable them to spend more time with students and staff.

     With the advent of Impact/ONLINE, schools that are not currently
automated will have increased choices available to them to automate and have
their records included in the statewide database. This further increases
access to information for students and others throughout the state. There is
also a telecommunications infrastructure initiative in progress that is to
focus on rural areas, with the goal of connecting all remote area schools and
libraries, as well as for use with telemedicine.

     For more information, contact Auto-Graphics, 800/776-6939, 909/595-7204,
Fax: 909/595-3506.

LEWIS AND CLARK COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CREATE DIGITAL LIBRARY WITH AMERITECH
LIBRARY SERVICES

     Dr. Dale Chapman, president of Lewis and Clark Community College in
Godfrey, Illinois, has finalized a strategic alliance with Ameritech Library
Services to support the college's technology initiative to enhance teaching
and learning by the year 2000. By providing its library with Ameritech Library
Services' products and services, including Horizon, NetPublisher, InfoShare,
and WebPAC, Lewis and Clark plans to transform its traditional college library
into a totally integrated library system.

     "We want to have the most advanced technology in the U.S.," said Chapman.
"As a forward-thinking community college, our vision is to empower students
and faculty by integrating technology into the learning process to develop
lifelong education. Our library will play a key role in making this vision a
reality. We plan to create the digital library of the future."

     Lewis and Clark plans to install the following products: Horizon, the
client/server library information system that includes integrated library
automation modules and a variety of easy-to-use interfaces; InfoShare, the
UNIX database server with Z39.50 support for locally storing and managing
citation databases; WebPAC, the server software for libraries that enables end
users with a Web browser to search any Z39.50-compliant database on the
Internet; and WinPAC, the graphical user interface for searching any
Z39.50-compliant database and gopher servers on the Internet.

     "I commend Dr. Chapman and his staff for their commitment to bringing
advanced technology to their students and library patrons," said Maribeth
Ward, vice president of Ameritech Library Services, Academic Market. "In the
near future, community colleges will need to have the capability to provide
access to library resources virtually anywhere, anytime. I see Lewis and Clark
as a model for other community colleges to follow."

     Lewis and Clark serves 6,000 students in all or part of seven counties in
southwestern Illinois. It is the only Illinois community college outside of
the Chicago metro area to offer an associate degree in library technology. The
college recently received the Illinois community College Board's institutional
quality award for academic excellence. The North Central Association of
Colleges (NCAC) recently awarded Lewis and Clark with a 10-year academic
accreditation, the longest term given by the association.

Division, Evanston, IL, 708/866-0150, Fax: 708/866-0178.

ITALIAN BOOK VENDOR'S RECORDS AVAILABLE IN RLIN

     Over 18,000 in-process records created by the Italian book dealers
Casalini Libri from 1994 through July 1995 have recently been added to the
RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network) Books file. This heralds the
beginning of a new service from The Research Libraries Group (RLG)--direct
access to and local use of major book vendor records.

     Libraries can use such records in several ways. They provide valuable
citations for new and recent publications. In the case of the Casalini
records, bibliographers or acquisitions librarians can export them with RLIN's
pass or put command to create order records in their local systems. Libraries
that have already received materials described in the records can export them
to use for local cataloging--or can do their cataloging directly in RLIN and
then export the result to the local online public access catalog (OPAC).

     With such book supplier records available in RLIN, individual libraries
are spared the local time and expense of evaluating, loading, and maintaining
these files themselves. In its negotiations with other book vendors, RLG is
concerned about keeping prices as low as possible in order to encourage use of
these records and to assist users in minimizing technical processing costs.

     RLG President James Michalko said that this step responds directly to
RLG's mission. "We're growing RLIN in many ways to enhance its usefulness to
research with early works, currently received materials, primary sources, and
unique cataloging, from the American Antiquarian Society's records to UN
Library data. This new kind of information from Casalini is of particular
import to collections serving international scholarship. It will be of great
value in supporting users of all kinds."

     The Casalini records cover materials of all kinds available in Italy, the
Vatican City, San Marino, the Italian canton of Switzerland, and Malta. They
describe publications in various formats including monographs, serials,
monographic series, microfilm, audiovisual, and CD-ROM. In the future,
Casalini Libri will be adding records regularly to RLIN via Internet file
transfer protocol.

     Casalini Libri order information is included on each record, but these
records represent far more than just a book dealer's title list. Each has been
prepared by expert staff directly from the published works, gives complete
bibliographical information, and, if necessary, includes notes in English with
additional details (which may not be evident from the strict bibliographic
description of the work) that Casalini Libri believes to be of significance to
selectors. Important noncommercial publications, even though they may not be
for sale, are also included. And in particular circumstances, unrevised
reprints, extracts, and theses are described.

     "This new service combines the value of records like the Casalini's with
RLIN's ability to integrate service into the local processing environment,"
said Linda Lerman, RLG bibliographic services officer. "Negotiations are
progressing with other book dealers who count RLG's members and RLIN users
among their best clients. A key goal is to help shorten the distance from
initial publication to having a work in the library, ready for use."

     For more information, contact RLG, Mountain View, CA, Fax: 415/964-0943.

THE LIBRARY CORPORATION UPDATES INTEGRATED TECHNICAL SERVICES SOFTWARE

     The Library Corporation recently released a new set of enhancements to
the ITS for Windows Integrated Technical Services Workstation software. The
update includes enhancements and features suggested by technical services
staff at various levels:

     --   Several record saving options are now available. Users may save to
the active (master) file, an export (transaction) file, and/or an external
system, in any combination, simultaneously. These options may be toggled on
and off at will. A separate option permits users to save a single record to a
separate new or existing MARC file without altering default configuration
settings.

     --   A publisher's ISBN prefix may now be used to generate a Result Set
that lists all of that publisher's works.

     --   Users may limit a search to an entire country instead of a single
political subdivision. For example, to search for items published in the U.S.,
users may enter "??u" as the place of publication.

     --   Configuration changes that were made on-the-fly may be abandoned at
any time in favor of the last saved default configuration.

     --   Enhancements to the MARC editor make it easier to move among open
records. Users may now select multiple entries from a Result Set and have
multiple MARC editors open at once. In addition, users may move among open
records with a keystroke or mouse click.

     --   Users may now choose to search until a dataset produces a Result
Set, and then continue the search with the next available dataset. Users may
also choose to search all datasets at once and produce a separate Result Set
for each.

     "Records come up quickly, and being able to look at more than one record
at a time is most helpful," said Debra Mattingly, director of the Washington
County (Jonesborough, Tennessee) Library. "I find it useful to tile
horizontally so I can easily cut and paste from one field or record to
another. This is especially helpful with multiple 949 holding fields."

     The Library Corporation (TLC) is a principal supplier of automated
library management and reference systems. TLC develops and markets
computer-based bibliographic information retrieval and automation systems to
public, university, school, and special libraries in the U.S., Canada, and
around the world.

     For more information, contact TLC, Inwood, WV, 800/624-0559,
304/229-0100, Fax: 304/229-0295.

INFORMATION DIMENSIONS DELIVERS ELECTRONIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR
INTRANETS

     Information Dimensions, Inc. has announced the availability of its
TECHLIBplus OPAC for Intranets, expanding its TECHLIBplus electronic library
management system to include Intranet patron access. This allows corporations,
government organizations, and specialized libraries to cost-effectively
deliver their automated library services to a broader audience by leveraging
the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.

     TECHLIBplus OPAC for Intranets provides direct access to the library
catalog with complete item status details and user request features using
popular Web client software. The system utilizes Information Dimensions' BASIS
WEBserver, which integrates popular Web servers, such as those from Netscape

secure environment designed for publishing and managing large-scale document
collections that reside behind a firewall.

     TECHLIBplus is a fully integrated library system designed for special
libraries and corporate information centers. It offers full library
services--acquisitions, cataloging, searching, circulation functions for books
and other materials, serials tracking, as well as control functions such as
ordering, renewing, receiving, claiming, and routing. TECHLIBplus is built on
Information Dimensions' BASIS Document Manager, which provides an
extended-relational database structure optimized to manage text and documents.
In addition to traditional bibliographic descriptions, TECHLIBplus provides
access to tables of contents, abstracts, and full-text documents, and it
manages compound documents containing text, word processing markup, graphics,
and images.

     "The Web is already an integrated part of the computing infrastructure
within most enterprises, making it an ideal platform for document-centric
applications," said Bill Forquer, vice president of marketing at Information
Dimensions. "Electronic library management is an ideal Intranet application
because companies will be able to achieve easier access to library resources,
lower their cost of computing, and improve ease-of-use and maintenance."

     Information Dimension's Intranet strategy is built around its BASIS
Document Manager and BASIS WEBserver products, which provide for managing
large-scale document collections. These tools include complete library
services, full-text retrieval, robust document storage management, link
management, document control, document delivery, security, and authentication.
Recognizing the significant role of the corporate library in managing
information assets, Information Dimensions has made electronic library
management for the Intranet an essential component of its strategy to deliver
Intranet-based document management solutions. Additional Intranet application
areas include regulatory compliance, competitive and market intelligence,
technical document publishing, policies and procedures, research, and records
management.

     TECHLIBplus and OPAC for Intranets are available immediately. Prices for

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MAINE LOGS 62 MILLIONTH OCLC ILL REQUEST

     The University of Southern Maine, located in Portland, logged the 62
millionth OCLC interlibrary loan request on October 20 for an article on
social work. The request was for the article "Integrative Model for Group
Work" in the quarterly serial "Social Work with Groups." The Department of
Veterans Affairs Learning Resources Center, in Togus, Maine, filled the
request on October 24.

     The 62 millionth OCLC interlibrary loan request came 37 days after the 61
millionth. "I was working away--just doing what I do every day," said Adrienne
Andrews, interlibrary loan assistant at the University of Southern Maine
Library who made the request. "I've been doing this for seven years and I
thought, 'If I hit it, I hit it, and if I don't, I don't.'"

     That laid-back attitude doesn't mean Andrews wasn't excited after
reaching the milestone. "I was really surprised to see the number, " she said.
"I shouted, 'I did it!' I think I startled some of the staff in the other
room."

     "We were all thrilled for Adrienne," said Casandra Fitzherbert,
interlibrary loan librarian at the University of Southern Maine Library.
Barbara Stevens completes the three-member interlibrary loan staff at the
library, a staff that helped make the University of Southern Maine one of the
top 20 lenders in New England this year, according to Fitzherbert. Total
lending and borrowing tops 20,000 transactions annually, she said.

     The University of Southern Maine comprises two campuses. In Portland, the
primary academic disciplines include psychology, business, and nursing. In
Gorham, the emphasis is on geoscience, music, and education.

     Located on the coast of southern Maine, the University of Southern Maine,
Portland campus, serves approximately 9,000 students. "As a state-supported
school, we also serve the general community," said Fitzherbert.

     The university library is located in a renovated cookie factory that had
been empty for some 25 years. "It's been renovated and now it's a very
high-tech, seven-story library in the heart of Portland."

     Northern Illinois University, in De Kalb, logged the 61 millionth OCLC
interlibrary loan request on September 13.

     The OCLC interlibrary loan system was activated in 1979. In the 1994/95
fiscal year, 5,400 libraries arranged over 7.5 million loans on OCLC's
interlibrary loan system.

     OCLC Online Computer Library Center is a nonprofit computer library
service and research organization whose computer network and services link
more than 21,000 libraries in 63 countries and territories.

     For more information, contact OCLC, Dublin, OH, 614/764-6000, Fax:

LOTUS INTERNOTES WEB NAVIGATOR BRINGS THE WEB TO THE NOTES DESKTOP

     Lotus Development Corp. has announced the forthcoming Lotus Notes Release
4, with its InterNotes Web Navigator, that makes it easier for users to
incorporate Internet information into their core business processes.

     The InterNotes Web Navigator translates Internet content directly into
Lotus Notes applications, allowing users to manipulate that information using
capabilities with application development, security, replication, mobile
access, and messaging.

     InterNotes Web Navigator takes full advantage of Notes Release 4's
intelligent agent builder, the Notes macro language or LotusScript to
automatically conduct searches and retrievals on the Web. Using this
capability, a user with responsibility for analyzing competitors, for example,
could program agents to retrieve Web pages from competitors' Web sites when
information is posted or altered. The Navigator could bring those pages to a
Notes database containing competitive information, then Notes would distribute
the updated information to the company's sales force every morning.

     InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML 3.0 documents,
including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and URLs, into Notes
for management in Notes. Notes users can also browse and retrieve Internet
information that exists beyond the Web, such as ftp, gopher, and Usenet, and
integrate it into Notes applications.

     Because InterNotes Web Navigator resides on a server, it eliminates the
need to provide TCP/IP on every client. Administrators have the option to
allow and deny access to specific sites, and frequently accessed pages can be
cached. Users can conduct Verity full-text searches, manage the data by
selected views (by category, by date, by name, etc.), or replicate the Web
database to their laptops for disconnected use. The InterNotes Web Navigator
also lets users mail Web pages to colleagues complete with hypertext links
intact, share bookmarks, or create a 'Web Tour.' Users can also rate favorite
Web sites and generate URL lists.

     The InterNotes Web Navigator and Lotus Notes 4 will support the same open
standards as the Internet, including TCP/IP and SMTP, HTTP, and HTML. The
InterNotes Web Navigator will ship in every Lotus Notes Release 4 client at no
extra cost. It will be available on Windows, OS/2, Mac, and UNIX, and will
support SPX, NetBIOS, Appletalk, and Banyan Vines.

     For more information on Lotus Notes in North America, contact Lotus at
800/346-1305.

KENT STATE UNIVERSITY USES OCLC TECHPRO SERVICE

     Kent State University, located in Kent, Ohio, is using the OCLC TECHPRO
service to catalog new books, backlogged gift materials, and university
dissertations and theses.

     "We decided to contract out our cataloging to reduce the cost of running
our technical services operation and to reallocate some of our staff to public
services," said Jeff Gatten, head of collection management at the library.

     Kent State University is sending more than 70 books by courier to OCLC
each working day. TECHPRO staff catalog the books and send records back to
Kent State via Electronic Data Exchange using OCLC's Internet ftp service.

ISI INTRODUCES RESEARCH ALERT DIRECT INTERNET-DELIVERED ALERTING PRODUCTS

     The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) has announced a new line
of Internet-delivered alerting services called Research Alert Direct (RAD).
These newly created services bring customized, affordable research information
directly to the end user's desktop. Six product packages--Journal Tracker,
Personal Alert, Professional Alert, Corporate Alert, Topics Select, and Focus
On--comprise a suite of profiled services available to the researcher and
information specialist. All Research Alert Direct products are drawn from
ISI's multidisciplinary database searching over 16,000 leading international
science, social science, and arts and humanities journals, books, and
proceedings.

     Research Alert Direct provides current, complete bibliographic
information that matches a user's profile. Information is drawn from the
contents of recently published journals, books, and proceedings as they are
processed for the ISI database. The product offerings include English-language
author abstracts as well as features such as author keywords, Keywords Plus,
and electronic ordering capability utilizing The Genuine Article (TGA), a
document delivery service provided by ISI. TGA processes all requests within
24 hours of receipt--within 30 minutes for special-request fax deliveries.

     Research Alert Direct products were developed to fulfill market requests
for flexible yet powerful electronic current awareness services. All of the
RAD products offer Internet delivery of current research information directly
to the desktop at an affordable price and at a frequency determined by the
user.

     Journal Tracker provides researchers with a cost-effective way to track
the tables of contents of up to 25 journals.

     Professional Alert and Personal Alert deliver customized, confidential
profiles to an individual or to several individuals within a department. These
profiles utilize ISI's unique capability to perform cited reference searching.
Searching on citations--the references or bibliographies published within
scholarly articles--provides users with the most targeted and refined profiles
on the market today. Unlimited profiling consultation is provided by ISI's
knowledgeable information specialists.

     Corporate Alert is designed to allow many corporate users to receive at
their desktops the tables of contents of journals at a reasonable cost.
Subscribers will work with ISI staff to set up individually defined profiles
from a selection of journals agreed to in the custom contract.

     Topics Select allows users to choose from a wide variety of predefined
search topics in the biomedical, physical science, engineering and technology,
and social science areas.

     Focus On is designed for users requiring substantial coverage of a
research field, along with the ability to search the data sets. These data
sets will use a Windows-based search engine to provide sophisticated
information search and retrieval capabilities. This product will be offered on
diskette or through the Internet. The Focus On data sets will provide broad
coverage of the current research literature.

     "We believe that Research Alert Direct provides a strong response to
critical challenges facing researchers today--timely access to affordable and
relevant information about leading scientific and technology developments,"
said Merle Jaffe, vice president and general manager of specialized current
awareness products, ISI. "Researchers and information specialists can define
personalized profiles or select predefined topics. The bibliographic data
delivered to their desktops will be customized to meet their needs, and
full-text ordering can be done electronically."

     Currently in a beta test phase, the Research Alert Direct products will
be offered to the entire research community in the first quarter of 1996.

     For more information, visit ISI's home page on the Web at
http://www.isinet.com or contact them by e-mail: isisales@ isinet.com or by
phone: 215/386-0100, Fax: 215/386-2911.

U.S. PATENTS CITATION DATABASE NOW ON THE WEB

     Community of Science, Inc., a leading World Wide Web electronic
publishing company based in Bethesda, Maryland, has introduced a fully
searchable version of the U.S. Patents Citation Database on the World Wide
Web. The U.S. Patents Citation Database on the Community of Science is a joint
venture of Community of Science and CHI Research, Inc., an internationally
recognized research consultancy specializing in the development and analysis
of science and technology indicators.

     This fully searchable U.S. Patents Citation Database contains all of the
approximately 1.7 million U.S. patents issued since 1975 and, according to the
company, is the most comprehensive source of patent information available on
the Internet.

     The database is updated weekly and permits subscribers to search all of
the important "front page" information about each patent: number, dates,
assignee, inventor, title, abstract, exemplary claims for recent years, and
U.S. and international classifications. In addition, the database tracks the
"lineage" of each patent--how each patent cites previous patents or is cited
by subsequent ones.

     Citation analysis is a key enhancement of the patent database and makes
it significantly more powerful than other databases of its kind.
Technologically significant patents tend to be cited more frequently than
those that are of lesser impact.

     The U.S. Patents Citation Database on the Community of Science has
extensive search capabilities. All important fields in the database are fully
indexed and can be searched using standard Boolean query mechanisms. It is
also searchable through a unique approach to the U.S. Patents Manual of
Classification, which permits searchers to identify specific areas of interest
through a meta-database query and to navigate across the classification
hierarchy using browse-and-search combinations to retrieve sought-after
information.

     The U.S. Patents Citation Database can be accessed on the Community of
Science Web server at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL):
http://cos.gdb.org. The service will be free of charge for all Community of
Science member institutions and available for $500 for individual accounts, or
somewhat higher for library and corporate accounts, for 12-month periods.

     For subscription and access information , contact Charles Wise at
Community of Science, Inc., 410/563-5382, e-mail: cw3@bestpl.hcf.jhu.edu.

JUPITER AND YAHOO! PUBLISH WEB SURVEY RESULTS

     A joint venture between Yahoo!, publisher of the Yahoo! browsable
Internet directory and search engine, and Jupiter Communications, a new media
research, publishing, and consulting firm, the Yahoo!/Jupiter Web User Survey
has been completed.

     According to the companies, the survey was designed to be the most
complete explication of the demographics and habits of the World Wide Web
community.

     The report gives a sharply focused picture of who is using the Web today,
what they are doing, what they want to do, and where the medium is headed
through the end of the decade.

     "The large numbers of current users accessing from home validates the
notion that the Web is truly a developing consumer medium," said Jupiter
managing director Kurt Abrahamson. "The World Wide Web will be a transactional
platform and a vital advertising venue. The survey results back up the
strength of the Web for all sorts of commercial ventures aimed at consumers."

     Some key findings revealed by the survey have been released. The home is
the predominant access point. Online services were found to provide relatively
few users to the Web as compared to direct Internet access. However, six in 10
users of the Web also have access to a commercial online service. Web users
can be described as both well educated and affluent. Substantial time is spent
online, with the average user's online time being approximately 20 hours per
week. A large portion of respondents (61 percent) reported that they are
spending less time watching television because they were spending time online.

     The executive level report from the Yahoo!/Jupiter Web User Survey is
available for purchase from Jupiter Communications. For more information,
contact Jupiter in New York, 800/488-4345, 212/780-6060.

NONPROFIT FORUM LAUNCHED ON COMPUSERVE ONLINE SERVICE

     A new online resource for charitable organizations worldwide has been
launched on CompuServe. The private subscription service is called NonProfit
Forum.  This national/international online information service brings a
multitude of tools to professionals, trustees, and volunteers of nonprofit
organizations and greatly enhances peer-to-peer networking.

     Online articles and discussion topics in the forum include: nonprofit
news and trends; professional and association news; leadership, management,
governance and trusteeship; legislative issues; financial accountability;
volunteers; planning; philanthropy and fund raising; planned giving; training
opportunities; computers and technology; career strategies; job postings; and
more.

     "Whether you're a staff member or a volunteer, running a charity and
raising money are tough jobs," said founder Sheree Parris Nudd, an 18-year
nonprofit veteran. "It can be hard to have the time to sift through all the
information that is out there to find what you need. That's where NonProfit
Forum comes in. If we don't already have information pointing to the resource
you need, we go out and find it for you."

     Because NonProfit Forum is a private service, a special CompuServe member
ID is required in order to subscribe. Software kits are available by calling
800/524-3388 and requesting a NonProfit Forum kit from representative #762.

     The first month of NonProfit Forum is free. After that, the subscription
is $15 per month for unlimited time inside the forum. (The fee does not
include the basic CompuServe fee of $9.95 per month.) Membership is open to
anyone.

TONI OLSHEN

     The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) has named Toni Olshen,
associate university librarian at York University, to the position of visiting
program office with ARL's Diversity Program. Olshen will concentrate her
research on diversity issues in both large academic and public libraries in
Canada. From November 1995 through May 1996, she will work with Kriza
Jennings, ARL program officer for diversity and minority recruitment, to
incorporate the Canadian research library perspective into ARL's diversity
program. She will also work with Jennings in developing model processes and
will learn to lead ARL diversity workshops focusing on Canadian libraries.

     Support for Olshen's role as visiting program officer is provided by York
University. The diversity program assists libraries in addressing a multitude
of diversity-related issues. Its primary concern is the development of
workplace climates that welcome, develop, foster, and support diversity. The
program seeks to develop an awareness of human differences that leads to a
valuing of and respect for these distinctions.

     An ARL visiting program officer (VPO) appointment is made when there is
a match between the Association's agenda, the expertise and availability of an
individual in an ARL member library, and the support of the member library
director. Inquiries about the VPO program may be directed to Jaia Barrett, ARL
deputy executive director (jaia@cni.org).

DATA/WARE DEVELOPMENT'S COLOR LABELS PRINT DIRECTLY ON CDS

     Data/Ware Development, a San Diego-based hardware developer and
manufacturer, has announced the release of ChameleonDirect, an automated,
4-color CD label printer. It prints text and bitmaps directly on
hydroscopically coated CD media, available from Eastman Kodak, MTC, TDK, and
Ricoh. These CDs accept the bubble jet ink used by ChameleonDirect and provide
near silk-screen quality color and resolution.

     In addition to providing a way to enhance CDs with a colorful logo or
other design, ChameleonDirect eliminates the manual labor associated with
printing and applying paper labels. Eliminating paper labels also prevents
out-of-balance effects in high-speed CD-ROM drives and the risk of media
damage due to label delamination.

     Additionally, ChameleonDirect requires no CD caddies or carriers, and
applies no heat or pressure to CDs during printing. The printer includes a
built-in motorized CD tray that transports the media through the print station
and returns it to the front of the printer. Customers don't have to deal with
awkward rear-to-front feeding or replacing worn-out cardboard print caddies.
The front loading/unloading design gives users the option of manually loading
individual CDs for printing, or using the ChameleonTransporter, labels can
automatically be printed on up to 75 CDs without operator intervention.

     For more information, contact Data/Ware Development, San Diego, CA,
619/453-7660, Fax: 619/453-2794.

ELECTRONIC COURSE MATERIALS FOR LEXIS-NEXIS MILLENNIUM INITIATIVE

     Under an agreement with LEXIS-NEXIS, seven law professors from Harvard
University Law School will create electronic course materials for law school,
authoring an electronic series of lectures and casebooks for use with
LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office. Student Office is a software suite of the
LEXIS-NEXIS Millennium Initiative.

     The Harvard professors will develop an integrated first-year law school
curriculum covering legal analysis, research, writing, and argumentation. They
will also electronically publish course materials that can be adapted to the
different needs of individual law school programs.

     First available for use in the fall 1996 semester, this four-year series
of electronic course materials will be based on the Folio Infobase software
platform that law students access through LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office.

     This agreement represents the first commissioned project of the LEXIS
Electronic Authors press, a component of the LEXIS-NEXIS Millennium
Initiative. The initiative is a program that integrates technology and the
teaching of law by working with law schools and faculty in the progression to
an electronic legal education program. Under the initiative, law faculty are
furnished with the software platform to transform course materials into
electronic casebooks and students are enabled to use their personal computers
to access and organize information from a variety of sources. The LEXIS
Electronic Authors Press is a new publisher of electronic casebooks authored
by law professors for students to use with the LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office
suite of software.

     For more information, contact LEXIS-NEXIS, Dayton, OH, 513/865-6800.

IHS ACQUIRES ERM'S ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY DATABASES

     The Environmental Resources Management Group has announced the sale of
ERM Computer Services and ENFLEX environmental, health, and safety (EHS)
databases to Information Handling Services Group (IHS Group) of Englewood,
Colorado. The new company to be formed, IHS Environmental, Inc., will be a
part of IHS Regulatory Products, Inc. and will produce and market the ENFLEX
environmental, health, and safety databases and the EarthLaw Environmental and
Safety Libraries.

     IHS Environmental will maintain a strategic alliance with the
Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group and will continue to draw on
the resources of this international environmental consulting organization to
provide clients with environmental, health, and safety regulatory information
and to produce additional value-added environmental information products.

     According to both organizations, the combination of expert environmental
health and safety knowledge and  a keen understanding of the information
business will enable IHS Environmental to expand the products and offer new
delivery mechanisms for the constantly changing environmental, health, and
safety marketplace.

     Chris Meyer, president of IHS Regulatory Products and CFO of the IHS
Group, said, "By combining the relative strengths of IHS Regulatory and its
EarthLaw environmental database with ENFLEX and a strategic alliance with the
ERM Group, IHS will be a premium provider of information on U.S. and
international environmental, health, and safety laws, rules, regulations and
their implications on business."

     ERM Computer Services and IHS Regulatory Products are recognized as
leading suppliers of environmental, health, and safety regulatory information
with the focus on providing this information to professionals in industry,
government, and education sectors. ERM's introduction of ENFLEX for Windows in
December 1994 increased the client base and set a standard for environmental,
health, and safety regulatory products in Windows.

     ERM Computer Services' 60 employees will remain with the company and
operations will continue to be conducted from the Exton, Pennsylvania
headquarters. Brian Gurnham will continue as president of IHS Environmental.
The same editorial staff of environmental, health, and safety information
professionals will continue to prepare the ENFLEX-EarthLaw database and
support the ENFLEX-EarthLaw product line.

     The combined ENFLEX-EarthLaw product line provides current and
comprehensive coverage of federal, state, and international environmental,
health, and safety regulatory information. It offers extensive coverage of
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation
(DOT), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Coast Guard,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations and corresponding coverage for
all 50 states. With the addition of EarthLaw's industry standards and military
specifications, ENFLEX-EarthLaw is a complete source for environmental,
health, and safety regulatory information. These products are available on
CD-ROM, online, magnetic media, and the Internet.

     For more information, contact Environmental Resources Management Group,
Exton, PA, 800/544-3117.

INSPEC TO COVER ELECTRONIC JOURNALS

     INSPEC has announced that it is extending its coverage of journals
available in electronic form. The type of electronic journals that will be
selected for indexing must contain peer-reviewed articles, which are
permanently stored in an archive maintained by a publisher. Examples of
journals that will be scanned for the database include "The Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Research" (published by the AI Access Foundation) and
"TCAD" ("Technology Computer Aided Design"), a forthcoming publication of the
IEEE.

     To accommodate electronic journals, some new fields have been created on
the INSPEC Tape Services. These are Document Number and URLs (Uniform Resource
Locators). The Document Numbers will be used for wholly electronic journals
(or for electronic journals published in parallel to print) that give articles
a unique number. Where they are believed to be stable, URLs will be given both
at the individual article level and at the level of the complete journal or
electronic document collection.

     In addition, INSPEC is enhancing journal records from the start of this
year by adding the following data:

     --   The ANSI Z39.56 Serial Item Contribution Identifier (SICI) codes
     --   The name of the publisher of the journal

     This has previously been given in the INSPEC record for nonserial
publications. Journal publisher information only appeared in the List of
Journals.

     For more information, contact IEE/INSPEC Department, IEEE Operations
Center, Piscataway, NJ, 908/562-5549.

OCLC FIRSTSEARCH, EPIC NEWS

2.5 MILLION INSPEC RECORDS ADDED; 5 MILLION RECORDS NOW AVAILABLE

     OCLC has increased its coverage of the INSPEC scientific and technical
database available on OCLC's FirstSearch and EPIC services, with the addition
of some 2.5 million records dating from January 1, 1969.

     Published by the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), the INSPEC
database is a comprehensive source of published reference
literature--conference proceedings, scientific and technical journals--in
physics, electrical engineering, computing and control, electronics, and
information technology.

     INSPEC records dating from 1987 have been available to researchers
through the FirstSearch service (on a per-search basis) and EPIC since
November 1993. OCLC has updated this database weekly since it became available
and will continue to do so after the addition of the INSPEC backfiles.

     "INSPEC is an essential resource for its breadth of coverage in all
fields of physics and electrical engineering," said Rick Noble, OCLC vice
president, reference services. "It's a cornerstone of FirstSearch's list of
engineering and technology databases."

EBSCOMAGS INCREASES FULL-TEXT AVAILABILITY

     OCLC's FirstSearch and EPIC services now offer the EBSCOMags database
from EBSCO Publishing. Featuring abstracts and indexes from more than 2,300
periodicals and ASCII full text online from more than 1,000 of those
periodicals, EBSCOMags is the fourth database on FirstSearch and EPIC to
support full text online.

     EBSCOMags is the FirstSearch and EPIC version of EBSCO Publishing's
MasterFILE FullTEXT 1,000 database. The database contains abstracts from
business, humanities, general science, social science, health, trade, and
vocation periodicals. In addition, it provides cover-to-cover indexing and
abstracting for "The New York Times" and "The Wall Street Journal" as well as
700 full-text consumer health brochures and 3,500 full-text Magill book
reviews.

     FirstSearch and EPIC users can search the EBSCOMags database as well as
other bibliographic databases to identify citations of interest. Users can
order delivery of the full text of the citations if the full text is available
in the EBSCOMags or other FirstSearch or EPIC databases, such as ArticleFirst
and FastDoc. FirstSearch and EPIC allow users to limit searches to citations
that have ASCII full text available online.

     The database contains abstracts and indices of periodicals published from
1984 to present, with the earliest full-text articles dating from 1990.

     EBSCOMags is available as a per-search and subscription database on
FirstSearch and is database 85 on EPIC.

     The FirstSearch service is designed for people who use libraries, with an
end-user interface that allows users to move through the online search process
in a few steps.

     EPIC, a full-featured online reference system that provides subject
access and keyword and Boolean searching to a variety of databases, is used
mostly by librarians and experienced searchers.

LILLY COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF COMMUNITY MEDICAL INFORMATION NETWORKS
OPERATOR

     Eli Lilly and Company and Integrated Medical Systems, Inc. have announced
that Lilly has completed its acquisition of Integrated Medical Systems, Inc.,
a developer and operator of medical communication networks. This follows the
announcement on August 3, 1995, that both companies had reached an agreement
in principle.

     Lilly acquired a minority interest in IMS as part of its purchase of PCS
Health Systems, Inc. from McKesson Corpora-tion in 1994. In partnership with
IMS, PCS became the first pharmacy benefit manager to offer electronic links
to physicians. The industry-leading information technology capabilities
offered by PCS also include online connections to more than 54,000 pharmacies
and 1,300 health plans.

     "The acquisition of IMS provides an opportunity for Lilly to forge closer
ties with health care providers and payers by giving it the ability to get
information quickly to people who provide care and make health care
decisions," said Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., president of North American
pharmaceutical operations for Lilly. "The IMS and PCS networks and technology
working together will provide physicians with the clinically-based patient and
drug information they need to support the delivery of quality, cost-effective
prescription therapy that will ultimately benefit consumers. IMS delivers
practical, cost-effective communication and information solutions that are
actively used by our clients throughout the United States," said Kevin Green,
president and chief executive officer of IMS. "This merger will permit us to
accelerate further development and deployment of our networks and provide
additional value to our customers through advanced technologies and a broader
array of products and services."

     Lilly is a global research-based pharmaceutical corporation headquartered
in Indianapolis, Indiana, that is dedicated to creating and delivering health
care solutions.

     IMS, of Golden, Colorado, is a provider of physician-focused, electronic
communication networks and services delivering decision-critical information
to the health care industry.

industries, is offered so that users can better pinpoint their searches.

programs or sent to an attached printer. Searches can also be run
automatically on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Results are then delivered

IIA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR WHITE PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO CURB INTERNET
PORNOGRAPHY

     The Information Industry Association (IIA) has announced its support for
a proposal submitted by Representative Rick White, (R-Wash.), which would
protect minors from accessing pornographic material on the Internet, while
providing incentives for online service providers to regulate material on
their services that could be deemed "harmful to minors." The language is
currently being debated by House Conference Committee conferees to H.R. 1555,
the "Telecommunications Act of 1995."

     IIA is the leading trade association representing over 500 companies
involved in providing and distributing information products and services
worldwide. Since its founding in 1968, IIA has been at the forefront of policy
decisions and initiatives that have shaped the National Information
Infrastructure.

     The White language would make it illegal for online service providers to
knowingly send directly to minors or to electronically display any material
that is deemed harmful to minors, ensure limited liability for Internet access
providers regarding content not under their control, and protect online
service providers from liability if they screen offensive material.

     "IIA and its members have always championed the responsible use of online
services. The White proposal represents a sensible balance between the need to
protect our children from pornographic material and efforts to invigorate the
Internet through the free and open exchange of ideas without fear of excessive
government regulation," said Ronald G. Dunn, president of IIA.

     Previous proposals to impose liabilities for online service providers
have been troublesome to IIA and its members, particularly because they failed
to reflect marketplace realities, threatened First Amendment rights, and
excluded incentives for users to act responsibly.

     "Government oversight and regulation is no substitute for market-based
solutions and parental empowerment. The White proposal would not only create
incentives for the development of encryption technologies, thereby limiting
the possibility of a 'chilling effect' on the Internet, but would give parents
a larger role in deciding what is appropriate viewing material for their
children," Dunn said.

Washington, DC, 202/639-8262.

CALL FOR ENTRIES: UMI LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AWARD

     $1,500 AND NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR INNOVATIVE LIBRARIAN

     Librarians who have developed innovative information systems may be
eligible for a cash award of $1,500 and recognition at the National Online
Meeting in New York.

     The annual Library Technology award from UMI honors librarians who
develop systems that make it easier for library patrons to find and use
information.

     UMI is now accepting nominations for the 1996 award. A special entry form
is not needed. To nominate someone, write a one- to two-page essay that
includes the name of the librarian and a brief description of his or her
accomplishments. Librarians may nominate themselves.

     Any library technology established in 1995, which directly benefits
public, academic, or corporate library patrons, is eligible for consideration.
Entries must be postmarked by March 1 and mailed to UMI 1996 Library
Technology Award, Attn: Thomas Pack, 620 South Third Street, Louisville, KY
40202-2475.

1995 WINNER--NAVIGATING THE INTERNET

     Last year's winner, Robert H. Miller, assistant library director at the
Salem (Oregon) Public Library, helped the institution become the first public
library in the state to navigate the Internet.

     Miller managed the final planning stage of a project that made the
library, in partnership with the City/County Data Center, the full-service
Internet provider of choice to the Salem area. The system also made local
government files available online to the community and established a new
channel for voters to communicate with elected public officials.

     As a result of his pioneering efforts, recognized by UMI and his home
community, Miller will serve as the independent judge for the 1996 Library
Technology award. The award was established in 1991 in cooperation with
Information Today, Inc., sponsor of the annual National Online Meeting.

HEALTH CARE ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

     A new survey suggests that the information revolution is redefining
access to health care. Consumers are more accepting of health information,
including advice about treatment received through a telephone or online
service, even if it means giving up a face-to-face visit with a care provider.

     These are among the findings of a statewide survey sponsored by Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM). The survey was released recently
at a national conference in Minneapolis entitled, "Health Care on the
Superhighway: The Information Management Revolution."

     The survey was conducted last October among benefit decision makers in
companies with 100 or more employees and among Minnesota residents who receive
health care coverage from an employer with 100 or more workers.

     "The survey is the clearest evidence to date of how dramatically access
to health care is being redefined by both employers and employees," said Jim
Woodburn, M.D., medical director of national accounts for Blue Plus, the HMO
affiliate of BCBSM. "How people get information--and in some cases, even
treatment--is less important than the quality and convenience of the
information."

     Woodburn said that personal contact with care providers remains important
for many health-related issues, but giving up some face-to-face contact might
be an acceptable trade-off for health information received over the telephone
or with a computer.

     The survey asked consumers and employers to evaluate three different
electronic services. The most highly regarded by both groups is a 24-hour
telephone service in which a nurse diagnoses a health problem and provides the
caller with recommendations for self-treatment.

     About eight out of 10 health care consumers surveyed--77 percent--said
they would use such a service, and 81 percent of employers in companies of
more than 100 employees would be likely to offer the service if it was
available.

     A telephone or online service that provides information on health care
topics of general interest would be used by 63 percent of the consumers and
offered by 61 percent of employers, according to the survey.

     The third option posed in the survey--telephone or online directories
that list health care providers and specific information on quality of care,
patient satisfaction measures, and fees--would likely be used by 60 percent of
consumers and 61 percent of employers.

     Both employers and their insured workers and families place a high value
on the quality of electronic information services. However, convenience ranks
nearly as high as quality among the factors that would influence consumers'
decisions to use telephone or online services. The services' cost is cited as
an influential factor by only 38 percent of consumers.

     Cost, however, is paramount to employers, cited by 62 percent as an
influential factor. Quality--cited by 55 percent of employers--ranks second
among issues that would shape an employer's decision to offer electronic
services as part of a company health plan.

     "What makes the findings especially striking is the high acceptance of
electronic information services even though both employees and employers
believe they would depersonalize health care," said Woodburn.

     While majorities of both consumers and employers said that electronic
services could depersonalize health care, the survey found that, for 44
percent of consumers, electronic information might be a satisfactory
replacement for face-to-face contact with a health care provider.

HEALTH CARE IN THE YEAR 2000

     Both employers and employees are convinced that electronic health
information services will dramatically increase access to health care in the
year 2000, but they are less certain about the impact on quality and cost.

     The two groups were asked to assume that in the year 2000, 25 percent of
all information about treatment options was provided through electronic
services. Based on that scenario, 83 percent of employers and 77 percent of
consumers said health care would be more accessible. However, only 68 percent
of employers and 57 percent of employees said care would be more affordable
five years from now. Sixty percent of employers said that quality of health
care would improve, but a minority of employees--49 percent-- agreed that
quality would be higher at the turn of the century.

ABOUT THE SURVEY

     The survey was conducted by Rockwood Research. Interviews of both
employers and people covered by an employer-provided health plan were
conducted by telephone between October 19th and 26th, 1995.

     For more information, contact BCBSM, Eagen, MN, 612/456-1502.

IEEE-USA SAYS INTERNET FILTERS OFFER BEST PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN

     IEEE-U.S. Activities (IEEE-USA) is urging Congress to heed the growing
promise of Internet filtering technology as the best way to protect children
in cyberspace. With divergent House and Senate approaches contained in
telecom-reform bills still awaiting conference-committee action, Internet
content control continues to be a bone of contention between proponents of
federal regulation and free-speech advocates.

     "Internet filters work as a child-safety cap on the personal computer,"
according to IEEE-USA Board Chair Joel B. Snyder. "This technology can give
users and their families control over choices on the Internet, without
government having to resort to unnecessary and ineffective controls on the
free flow of information."

     Driving the legislative debate so far have been fears that the
unregulated growth of cyberspace has opened opportunities for purveyors of
obscene or indecent materials to reach children now going online at home and
at school. While some believe that federal restrictions on content providers
are the answer, IEEE-USA argues that government censorship attempts will not
work on the transnational Internet and warns that government controls threaten
to choke a vibrant medium founded on free information exchange.

     The 33rd Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting in Stockholm,
chaired this past summer by Internet pioneer and IEEE Fellow Vinton G. Cerf,
led to a new IETF working group that is developing the necessary technical
standards for reader-selectivity products. In the U.S., a broad industry
consortium announced in September that it will create a consensual
content-labeling system, the Platform for Internet Content Selection,
scheduled for release in early 1996.

     Most content-filtering methods fall into one of three categories. Host
access control features software packages that run on the user's computer and
exclude access to sources known to contain objectionable material or that
allow access only to sites designated as acceptable. Information filtering
using source labels would allow specific materials to be rated by their source
and filtered. Information filtering using third-party ratings combines the
advantages of third-party monitoring with fine "granularity," an ability to
sort materials within even a single document. Consumers could subscribe to a
rating service to select or exclude content based on that organization's
criteria.

     In the near future, responsible adults may be able to combine a variety
of technical approaches to create the most appropriate environment for
children in their care. For example, parents might install labeling-compliant
browser software on the home computer, subscribe to a third-party service, and
configure the browser to verify for age-appropriateness with the labeling
service before downloading text or pictures or connecting to chat groups. They
might also configure the browser to block children's access to items the
service has not labeled. Or, if parents want to permit somewhat greater
access, they might set the browser to consult the sources' own labels.

     IEEE-USA has pledged the efforts of U.S. engineers to assist in realizing
the full promise of the new technologies. In creating a cyberspace environment
appropriate for children, "technology alone is not a substitute for
conscientious parenting, adult supervision, and common sense," said Snyder.
However, he adds, "U.S. engineers can be part of the solution by educating the
public on the effective use of Internet resources, by helping to develop the
next generation of electronic filtering technologies, and by using their
technical know-how to enable their families and community schools to explore
cyberspace wisely."

Engineers, 202/785-0017.

NLIGHTN OFFERS WEB ACCESS TO PIERIAN PRESS DATABASES

     NlightN, an Internet-based information service, has announced plans to
offer a Core Reference Services package of four databases from Pierian Press,
a leading publisher of reference resources.

     The four databases--A Matter of Fact, Directory of National Helplines,
Media Review Digest, and Consumers Index--will be offered to libraries and
other institutional subscribers for an annual fee of $595. The price, which is
competitive with the cost of an annual subscription to the print volumes,
includes a large back-file of reference listings from previous years. In
addition, the package has been designed to allow up to four simultaneous users
at each subscriber site.

     "Packaging these four databases and offering them online represent a
fundamental shift in the way reference databases are delivered to
institutional subscribers," said Brower Murphy, CEO of NlightN. "Internet
access is a natural way to expand the resources available to smaller
libraries."

     "NlightN has made it possible for us to deliver first-rate reference
materials at a reasonable cost," said C. Edward Wall, founder and president of
Pierian Press. "This will benefit smaller public, school, and special
libraries that can now offer some 'core' resources they couldn't afford
otherwise."

     The A Matter of Fact database contains approximately 75,000 full-text
statistical excerpts on current social, economic, political, health and
environmental issues with more than 12,000 new abstracts added annually.
Approximately 40 percent of the full-text excerpts come from congressional
hearings and the "Congressional Record," reflecting public policy formation at
the highest levels. In addition, more than 1,000 serial sources are monitored
to identify the statistical excerpts included in this knowledge base. "Library
Journal" recently cited A Matter of Fact as an "absolutely essential reference
resource for the digital age."

     The Directory of National Helplines is a specialized directory of social,
economic, health, and environmental helplines for people in need of support
and advice. The helplines are sponsored by national organizations and agencies
that provide services to runaway children, work to prevent domestic violence,
offer AIDS counseling and research updates, dispatch emergency response teams
to handle toxic spills and other environmental disasters, provide enabling
technologies to persons with physical disabilities, and more.

     The directory also includes numerous TravelLines, providing toll-free
numbers to travel services and agencies that send free information or provide
free services for their respective areas of responsibility. The directory
contains approximately 1,000 resources, about 60 percent of which are national
service/support lines.

     Media Review Digest is a core media reference tool and standard catalog
of media information, offering a comprehensive guide to reviewed and evaluated
nonprint media. The version of the database offered online provides coverage
from 1989 to the present, including approximately 50,000 media resources and
more than 100,000 reviews, evaluations, awards, and prizes from over 150
reviewing sources and organizations that present awards. The media forms
covered in the digest include educational and feature files; videocassettes;
videodiscs; filmstrips; educational and spoken-word records, tapes, and
compact discs; CD-ROMs and other optical media; and slides, transparencies,
kits, maps, anatomical models, games, and other miscellaneous media items.

     Consumers Index provides access to more than 90,000 evaluations, tests,
alerts, warnings, and recalls of specific products, services and facilities
covered in about 120 periodicals and/or related services of federal agencies
(e.g., news releases from related agencies). Also included are citations with
abstracts for more than 70,000 articles on all aspects of consumerism and
consumer protection. Products and services of primary interest to consumers
are covered, including automobiles, motorcycles, boats, kitchen appliances,
audio and photographic equipment, food and beverages, health and nutrition
products, travel and vacation destinations. In addition, sources of potential
risk to consumers are monitored by the database, such as "incidents" at
nuclear power plants in the U.S.

     NlightN, a division of The Library Corporation, was formed in 1994 to
develop and market an online research service. Incorporated in 1975, The
Library Corporation is one of the largest library automation vendors in the
U.S., supplying more than 12,000 libraries.

     Pierian Press has been serving school, academic, public and special
libraries, and library patrons since 1968. Pierian Press publishes databases,
reference tools, and journals, including "Library HiTech" and "Reference
Services Review."

CANADIAN CENTRE FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ENHANCES CHEMINFO
DATABASE

     The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) has
undertaken significant upgrading to the CHEMINFO database. Enhancements
include database design changes and important new content. CHEMINFO has a
broad audience including chemical manufacturers and suppliers, health and
safety professionals, and employees who handle chemicals in their jobs.
Produced by CCOHS's occupational health and safety specialists, the CHEMINFO
database contains practical, summarized occupational health and safety
information on more than 1,000 chemicals.

     CHEMINFO's chemical profiles describe potential workplace hazards and
control measures as well as detailed evaluations of health, fire, and
reactivity hazards. CHEMINFO also contains chemical-specific recommendations
on topics such as storage and handling, personal protective equipment,
accidental release, first aid, and international hazard classifications.

     All CHEMINFO records now include The European Union EINECS/ELINCS Number,
Hazard Classification, Risk Phrases and Safety Phrases; U.S. Department of
Transportation Infor-mation; and American Industrial Hygiene Association
(AIHA) Workplace Environmental Exposure Limits (WEELs) and Emergency Response
Planning Guides (ERPGs).

     In addition, developmental CHEMINFO records, which currently contain
physical property information, TLVs, PELs, and flammability information, now
include IARC, NTP, and  ACGIH carcinogenicity evaluations, NIOSH respiratory
protection guidelines, resistance of materials for protective clothing,
sampling and analysis information, and stability and reactivity information.

     Design changes to the CHEMINFO database include new print formats that
allow users to print all regulatory data and occupational exposure limits
information in one concise print format.

     The CHEMINFO database is updated quarterly on both the MSDS (A1) and
CHEMSource (A2) CD-ROMs and is available for as little as $250 Canadian/U.S.
per year.

EASTMAN KODAK DONATES $1 MILLION TO NATIONAL DIGITAL LIBRARY PROGRAM

     During a recent news conference at the 1995 Federal Imaging Conference in
Washington, Eastman Kodak Co. CEO George Fisher presented a letter committing
to the first installment of a $1 million gift to the Library of Congress'
National Digital Library (NDL) Program. The NDL Program aims, in collaboration
with other institutions, to digitize 5 million items by the year 2000 and make
them freely available over the Internet.

     "The Library is grateful to George Fisher and Eastman Kodak for their
support of the National Digital Library Program," said the Librarian of
Congress, James H. Billington. "Kodak, a leader in electronic imaging
technology, today demonstrates its commitment to the program through its
generous gift."

     During the news conference, Bob Zich, the Library's director of
electronic programs, narrated a demonstration of the NDL Program. The Library
participated in the Federal Imaging Conference as an exhibitor, and a Library
employee served as the conference's chairman. The Library's World Wide Web
site can be accessed at http://www.loc.gov.

     Private sector contributions to the NDL Program, including Kodak's, now
exceed $19 million. The program, which began in October 1994, has a goal of
$45 million in private contributions by the year 2000. The Library has
requested an additional $15 million in appropriated funds to reach its overall
goal of $60 million for the NDL Program by 2000, the 200th anniversary of the
Library of Congress.

QUESTEL OFFERS "INSIDE THE PTO ALERTS"

     Questel Publishing, a division of Questel--Orbit, Inc., has announced the
availability of a new electronic e-mail service. "Inside the PTO Alerts," a
derivative of the monthly newsletter "Inside the PTO," reports on
late-breaking intellectual property news and events taking place at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the Court of Appeals for the Federal
circuit, in Congress and at other venues.

     "With the dramatic growth of intellectual property in just the past
decade, the passage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and
the proposed privatization of the PTO, there is a pressing need for IP
professionals to keep abreast of the increasing number of complex changes
occurring in patents, trademarks, and copyrights," said John A. Jenkins,
president of Questel--Orbit, Inc. and editor-in-chief of Questel Publishing.
"But attorneys and law librarians are very busy, so it is our staff's
responsibility to sift through all the news and deliver only the most
important to the desktops of these professionals."

     Recent "Alerts" informed subscribers of the U.S. and European Union's
failure to reach agreement on an important international trademark treaty;
congressional talks on copyrighting works sent over the information
superhighway; and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear a case concerning
the competency of lay juries in understanding technical patent suits.

     Other "Alerts" have covered changes in rules and regulations, policies
and procedures, and personnel at the PTO, which is under increasing pressure
from Congress to spin off from the Commerce Department and become a government
corporation. At present, "IPTO Alerts" is free to subscribers of "Inside the
PTO" and to others who request it.

     For more information or to subscribe to the "IPTO Alerts" service,
contact Questel Publishing, McClean, VA, 800/326-1710; e-mail:
IPTO@questel.orbit.com.
