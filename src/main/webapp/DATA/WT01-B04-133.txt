<H1><CENTER>Use of Marijuana as a &quot;Medicine&quot;</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
There currently exists some controversy concerning smoking marijuana as
a medicine. Many well-intentioned leaders and members of the public have
been misled by the well-financed and organized pro-drug legalization lobby
into believing there is merit to their argument that smoking marijuana is
a safe and effective medicine. A review of the scientific research, expert
medical testimony, and government agency findings shows this to be erroneous.
There is <B>no</B> justification for using marijuana as a medicine<BR>
<BR>
The California Narcotic Officers' Association consists of over 7,000 criminal
 justice professionals who are dedicated to protecting the public from the
devastating effects of substance abuse, whether cocaine, methamphetamine,
or marijuana. We have seen first hand the debilitating and often tragic
results, both psychologically and physically, of those who choose intoxication
as part of their lifestyle. We have studied the medicinal use of marijuana
issue, compiling information from medical experts to present to those we
are sworn to protect. It is our firm belief that any movement that liberalizes
or legalizes substance abuse laws would set us back to the days of the '70s
when we experienced this country's worst drug problem and the subsequent
consequences. In the '80s, through the combined and concerted efforts of
law enforcement, prevention and treatment professionals, illicit drug use
was reduced by 50  percent. Teenagers graduating from the class of 1992
had a 50  percent less likely chance of using drugs than those who graduated
in the class of 1979.<BR>
<BR>
Substance abuse rises whenever public attitude is more tolerant toward drugs.
i.e.. they are safe and harmless. Other factors that contribute to a rise
in use include increased availability, reduced risk associated with using
or selling, and lower prices. In 1993, for the first time after 12 years
of steady decline, illicit drug use rose and continues to climb. A major
contributing factor is a message that drugs  &quot;aren't so bad.&quot;
 To counter this &quot;just say yes&quot; campaign, we feel compelled to
provide the facts on the use of smoking marijuana as a medicine. These well-documented
facts will prove beyond a doubt that <B>MARIJUANA IS NOT MEDICINE</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
FACT: The movement to legitimize smoking marijuana as a medicine is NOT
encouraged by the pharmaceutical companies, Federal Food and Drug Administration,
health and medical associations, or medical experts; but instead by groups
such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)
and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). These organizations have little medical
expertise and favor various forms of legalizing illicit drugs.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: Pro legalization organizations have admitted that their strategy to
legalize marijuana begins with legitimizing smoking marijuana as a medicine.
As reported in High Times magazine, the Director of NORML expressly stated
that the medicinal use of marijuana is an integral part of the strategy
to legalize marijuana. Tony Serra, a criminal defense attorney associated
with the prolegalization groups, stated that medicinal marijuana is the
&quot;chink in the administration's armor&quot; that will lead to society
seeing pot's mystical effects of peace, sisterhood and brotherhood. He is
also the one who said, &quot;If you kill a cop, I'll pay to take the case;&quot;
and &quot;My sustenance is drugs and murder.&quot; A former director of
NORML, Keith Stroup, told an Emory University audience that NORML would
be using the issue of medicinal marijuana as a red herring to give marijuana
a good name. The director of NORML, Dick Cowan, is quoted, &quot;The key
is medical access. Because once you have hundreds of thousands of people
using marijuana under medical supervision, the whole scam is going to be
brought up...then we will get medical, then we will get full legalization.&quot;
Is there any doubt about their true motive while they play this cruel hoax
on people with legitimate illnesses?<BR>
<BR>
FACT: A leader of the medicinal use of manj uana movement, Dr. Lester Grinspoon
is an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard as well as chairman of
the board of NORML. He has made absurd claims such as marijuana, like aspirin,
is &quot;unusually safe;&quot; using cocaine two or three times a week &quot;creates
no serious problems;&quot; and &quot;Chronic cocaine abuse usually does
not appear as a medical problem.&quot; He wrote a book called 'Marihuana:
The Forbidden Medicine', which is the bible for pro-marijuana advocates.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: The studies cited by the marijuana advocates have been found to be
either unscientific, poorly researched, or involved pharmaceutical THC,
not marijuana. One of their &quot;experts&quot; who testified at the 1987
federal hearings to reschedule marijuana was a wellness counselor at a health
spa who admitted under oath to using every illegal mind altering drug he
ever studied. Another &quot;expert'' admitted he had not kept up with new
medical or scientific information on marijuana for over 18 years. Another
doctor claimed there was voluminous medical research on the effectiveness
of marijuana but under oath, when asked to cite the number of the studies,
he replied, &quot;I would doubt very few.&quot; The fact is that there is
not one reliable scientific study that shows smoking marijuana to be a safe
and effective drug.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: The majority of the marijuana advocates' &quot;evidence&quot; comes
from unscientific, nonscrutinized or analyzed anecdotal statements from
people with a variety of illnesses. It is unknown whether these individuals
used marijuana prior to their illness or are using marijuana in combination
with other medicines. It is also unknown whether they have had recent medical
examinations, are justifying their use of marijuana, experiencing a placebo
effect, or experiencing the intoxicating effect of smoking marijuana.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana (THC) is already legally
available in pharmaceutical capsule form by prescription from medical doctors.
This drug, Marinol, is less often<BR>
prescribed because of the potential adverse effects, and there are more
effective new medicines currently available. Marinol differs from the crude
plant marijuana because it consists of one pure, well-studied, FDA-approved
pharmaceutical in stable known dosages. Marijuana is an unstable mixture
of over 400 chemicals including many toxic psychoactive chemicals which
are largely unstudied and appear in uncontrolled strengths.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: The manufacturers of Marinol, Roxane Laboratories Incorporated, do
not agree with the pro-marijuana advocates that THC is safe and harmless.
In the Physician's Desk Reference, a good portion of the description of
Marinol includes warnings about the adverse effects..<BR>
<BR>
FACT: Comnon sense dictates that it is not good medical practice to allow
a substance to be used as a medicine if that product is: <BR>
<BR>
1) not ADA approved <BR>
2) ingested by smoking <BR>
3) made up of hundreds of different chemicals <BR>
4) not subject to product liability regulations <BR>
5) exempt from quality control standards <BR>
6) not governed by daily dose criteria <BR>
7) offered in unknown strengths (THC) from 1 to 10 +percent <BR>
8) self-prescribed and self-administered by the patient.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: The federal govemment, over the last 20 years involving a number of
administrations from both political parties has determined that smoking
marijuana has no redeeming medicinal value, and is, in fact, harmful to
health. These governmental agencies include the Drug Enforcement Administrations,
the Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Public Health Service. Their
latest finding, as recently as 1994, was affirmed in a decision by the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: Since the pro-marijuana lobby has been unsuccessful in dealing with
the federal govemment, they have targeted state and local govemments to
legitimize smoking marijuana as a medicine. A careful examination of their
legislative and/or ballot proposals reveals they are written to effectively
neutralize tile enforcement of most marijuana laws. Crude, intoxicating
marijuana under their proposals would be easier to obtain and use than even
the most harmless, low level prescription drug.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: Major medical and health organizations, as well as the vast majority
of nationally recognized expert medical doctors, scientists and researchers,
have not accepted smoking marijuana as a safe and effective medicine. These
organizations include: the American Medical Association, the American Cancer
Society, National Sclerosis Association, the American Glaucoma Association,
American Academy of Ophthalmology, National Eye Institute. National Cancer
Institute, National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National
Institute of Dental Research, and the National Institute on Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: There are thousands of studies available documenting the harmful physical
and psychological effects of smoking marijuana. The harmful consequences
include but are not limited to premature cancer, addiction, coordination
and perception impairment, a number of mental disorders including depression.
hostility and increased aggressiveness, general apathy, memory loss, reproductive
disabilities, impairment to the immune system, numerous airway injuries,
and other general problems associated with intoxication.<BR>
<BR>
FACT: The medicinal marijuana movement and its media campaign have helped
contribute to the changing attitude among our youth that marijuana is harmless,
therefore contributing to the increase of marijuana use among our young
people afler 12 years of steady decline.<BR>
<BR>
The overriding objective behind this movement is to allow a minority (less
than five percent) of our society to get &quot;stoned&quot; with impunity.
This small minority is willing to put our citizens at risk from all the
negative and disastrous effects caused to and by those who are intoxicated.
What we don't need in this society is more intoxicated people on our highways,
in workplaces, schools, colleges, or in our homes.<BR>
<BR>
We ask you, as concerned citizens, to join us in spreading the truth and
countering the lies propagated by those who want to legalize drugs. If you
would like more information, call the CNOA office at (805) 287-0195.<BR>
