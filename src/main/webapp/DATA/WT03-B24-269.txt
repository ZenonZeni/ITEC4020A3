<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - Responding to outrage against Texaco's
racist job 
discrimination, the Rev. Jesse Jackson called Tuesday for an 
immediate boycott of goods and services sold by the giant 
oil company.</p>

<p>Jackson announced the boycott after he and the Rev. Al 
Sharpton had lunch with Texaco Chief Executive Officer, 
Peter Bijur, at the company's headquarters in White Plains, 
New York.</p>

<p>Jackson said Bijur refused to budge on the issue of job 
discrimination despite the furor over the release of a tape 
recording of a 1994 Texaco board meeting in which top 
executives referred to African American workers as "black 
jelly beans" who "stick to the bottom of the bag." They made 
demeaning comments about Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of 
lights, and Kwaanza, an African American holiday patterned 
after an African harvest festival. </p>

<p>They went on to discuss shredding documents to conceal 
Texaco's record of discrimination in hiring and promotions 
from discovery in a $520 million discrimination lawsuit by 
the company's 1,400 minority workers. The tape recording was 
made by Richard A Lundwall, at the time senior coordinator 
for personnel services. He was later terminated when Texaco 
downsized. In revenge, he handed the tape over to attorneys 
representing the minority workers.</p>

<p> "It will be cheaper to settle this suit than to prolong 
it," Jackson added. "It should have been the first item on 
his agenda."</p>

<p>Asked by a reporter if the boycott is immediate, Jackson 
replied, "I hope when you leave here and you'll need gas, 
you'll see a Texaco station and go right by." Bijur decried 
the move. "Boycotts are divisive in my view, they cause 
economic disruption."</p>

<p>William Taylor, president of Oil, Chemical, and Atomic 
Workers Local 7-507 in Aurora, Illinois endorsed the Texaco 
boycott. "I've added Texaco to my list of companies not to 
patronize," he told the World in an interview. "A boycott 
can be very effective if it is properly organized. When 
enough people stop buying Texaco products the company will 
yield." Taylor's local represents hundreds of Amoco and 
Mobil oil workers while a Texas OCAW local represents many 
Texaco employees. "There's racism and discrimination in the 
boardrooms of all of these big corporations," he told the 
World. "Its the nature of the beast." </p>

<p>Lundwall's tape is now being compared to the videotaped 
beating of Rodney King by seven Los Angeles police officers 
in 1991 which forced the issue of police brutality into the 
public eye. It is a smoking gun that exposes the big lie 
(spouted by GOP Presidential nominee Bob Dole and other 
right-wing demagogues in this year's election) that racial 
discrimination is ended and that the U.S. is a "color-blind" 
society. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote on Nov. 
11, "Even as the Texaco story was making its way around the 
country, voters in California were approving Proposition 
209, a measure aimed at dismantling affirmative action 
programs. Who needs affirmative action when discrimination 
is a thing of the past?" he asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>Herbert added, "Racial discrimination is as common as 
commercials on television. Employment discrimination is so 
widespread the agencies attempting to deal with it are 
overwhelmed. Most of it is ignored."</p>

<p>Richard T. Seymour, director of the Employment 
Discrimination Project of the Lawyer's Committee for Civil 
Rights Under Law in Washington, told the World, "The Texaco 
lawsuit makes the case very strongly that there is a need 
for continued affirmative action programs. It also shows 
that corporate executives need instruction in ethics." </p>

<p>If the Texaco executives destroyed documents, Seymour added, 
"it is obstruction of justice and they should face criminal 
charges. They should be prosecuted."</p>

<p>In cases in which evidence is destroyed, he added, "the 
judge has the option of declaring a very strong presumption 
that Texaco was guilty of discrimination."</p>

<p>Seymour cited the case of Mitsubishi, found guilty of sexual 
harassment and sex discrimination at its auto assembly plant 
in Illinois. "The Mitsubishi case was a powerful indicator 
of the pervasiveness of sex discrimination that went all the 
way to the top of the corporate structure." The Texaco case, 
he said, promises to be equally sweeping in exposing the 
racist practices of a corporate giant with $36 billion in 
annual revenues and net profits last year of $607 million, 
up 33 percent from a year earlier. </p>

<p>In a Nov. 5 letter to Bijur, H. Carl McCall, New York State 
Comptroller wrote: "I am profoundly dismayed by reports of 
Texaco executives planning to destroy documents relevant to 
a discrimination lawsuit and racial epithets to describe 
employees." He added, "I am the sole trustee of the New York 
State Common Retirement fund. The Fund owns over 1.2 million 
shares of Texaco with an estimated value of $114 million.</p>

<p>"On behalf of the 880,000 retirees and active members of the 
Fund, I am greatly concerned that a corporate culture of 
disrespect and discrimination could have a negative impact 
on performance and value," said McCall, the first African 
American elected to state-wide office in New York. He 
demanded an end to these practices. "I eagerly await your 
reply," he added.</p>
