Each issue of the educational Investors Alliance Investor Journal features
in-depth research articles, timely investment news, and guidance from
professionals all aimed at improving your investment results.  You profit
by learning firsthand what the investment experts are doing now.  We
regularly interview mutual fund managers and alert you to new
opportunities, helping you select investments that promise substantial
return at relatively moderate risk.  Our four and five diamond fund
directory lists the top mutual funds with the best risk-adjusted returns.
Spotlight Stocks highlights emerging profit opportunities that
institutions have overlooked.  When the giant institutions subsequently
move into these investments, your profits can soar.  The monthly stock
screens focus on undervalued stocks and mutual funds that sell below
intrinsic value as determined by a sophisticated series of quantitative
computer models. The Investors Alliance Investor Journal gives you new
insight into investment opportunities judged to be outstanding by market
experts.</font>
