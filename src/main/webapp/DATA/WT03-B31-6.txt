AMERITECH AWARDS GRANT FOR TEACHING
DETROIT TEACHERS TO USE INTERNET


   The Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP)
received a $32,500 grant from Ameritech, a regional
telephone company, to help students and teachers use the
Internet.

   The money will support DAPCEP's Internet teacher-training
program in which more than 60 Detroit teachers will receive
eight hours of instruction on how to use the Internet in the
classroom. Teachers then will become consultants for DAPCEP
and work with students after school hours to assist with
Internet research projects.

   "The Internet has so many valuable resources for
education," said Lyn Allen, Ameritech's director of
contributions. "Our goal with this contribution is to try
and move the Internet from a once-a-week toy to a natural
part of every lesson plan."

   Kenneth Hill, DAPCEP executive director, said teacher
training will begin in February and run through April.
"Teachers need to learn how to use the Internet to prepare
our students for the information age," he said. "We are
excited about this opportunity to provide more resources for
teachers and students."

   DAPCEP, a pre-college education program, has 5,000 middle
and high school students enrolled. Representatives from
local industry, 11 colleges and universities, the Detroit
Public Schools, parents and community groups work together
to offer school and Saturday classes, summer enrichment
programs, mentoring, tutoring, summer jobs, scholarships and
teacher training. DAPCEP celebrates its 20th anniversary
this year.

   For more information, contact Sara Snyder of Ameritech at
(313) 223-7192.

TEXAS SETS APRIL CONFERENCE
ON TECHNOLOGY IN SCHOOLS


   Dallas will be the site of the Technology in Schools
Conference, to be held April 25-27.

   Educators and administrators representing school
districts from throughout Texas are expected to attend the
conference to learn about the latest in education
technology.

   The conference also is expected to attract a  large
number of technology firms exhibiting their products. Texas
is considered an important market for such firms,
particularly since the state legislature established the
Technology Infrastructure Fund (TIF), which gives public
schools access to $150 million in grants and loans for the
purchase of technology-related equipment.

OMAHA SUPERINTENDENT ADVISES PEERS
TO INVOLVE STAKEHOLDERS IN TECHNOLOGY


   Involvement of all stakeholders in a community is vital
to developing support for major investments in school
technology, according to the experience of one Midwest
school superintendent.

   A "multifaceted approach" to educating and involving
school staff, board members, parents and members of the
community at large was critical to the success of the
Westside Community Schools in Omaha, Neb., said
Superintendent Ken Bird.

   Writing in Edutopia, the newsletter of the George Lucas
Educational Foundation, Bird said a recent survey of
residents in his district showed 96 percent "support our
investment in technology." He attributes that support to the
efforts made to involve the entire community in the
transition to modern technology in the schools.

   Bird said he talks regularly to people about how
technology can play a positive role in educational
transformation. "The goal of this daily discourse is to help
all the stakeholders become aware of our vision - that
technology provides tools to increase our capacity to
gather, organize, analyze, and impart information and that
it helps increase learners' abilities in all academic areas
as well as areas such as critical thinking, problem solving,
communication and social skills," he said.

   A successful transition requires extensive involvement
and full support of a district's teaching staff, Bird said.
"So teachers were invited to become actively involved in
designing and planning the learning environments in which
they conducted their work." It also was realized that the
infusion of technology "would create a critical need for
ongoing staff development, with an emphasis on 'ongoing' -
not one-time training opportunities."

   Another vital component of the strategy "has been
building a sense of need and urgency with the board of
education," he said. "We accomplished this by making
technology an integral part of the board's operation and by
giving members the support they need to facilitate their
learning."

   The board's meeting room is equipped with state-of-the-
art presentation equipment and meetings frequently include
presentations by students and teachers who use "the
opportunity to demonstrate to the board - and to the public
- how fundamental technology has become to learning."

   Each board member's home was connected with the
districtwide computer network, Bird said. "Their work
stations provide instant access to the district's
information bulletin board, calendars and e-mail, as well as
access to all of the resources available on the Internet.
This active involvement with technology has been a
significant factor in gaining and maintaining board
support."

   Providing opportunities for community members to use new
technologies and experience their value "was a key element
in our transformation," the Omaha superintendent said.

   "Our district has a long tradition of active community
participation and we are committed to weaving the fabric of
the community and the schools. I was especially concerned
about trying to prevent the emergence of a 'haves' and
'have-nots' situation, in which students from families with
technological resources in their homes could gain a
considerable advantage over those whose families could not
afford such resources." While the district could not put a
computer in every home, "we have been able to do some things
which have provided greater access to computers for
everyone," he said.

Low-Income Access

   Bird cited an initiative at Amber Ridge Family Education
Center in an apartment complex of many low-income families.
"The center provides a wide variety of services to the
families of students who live there, including access to
computers. The students use computers for homework
assignments and other learning experiences. Adults, too, can
use the computers and training is provided for those who
don't have computer skills."

   Also, the newly renovated Westside Middle School has been
opened to the public in the evenings and on Saturdays.
"Parents, students and 'empty nesters' take advantage of the
school's computers, with students often guiding their
parents and grandparents on their first trip down the
'information highway.'"

   Bird noted new technologies "have helped us move toward
better teaching and learning, more challenging roles for
teachers, and greater levels of community involvement. Yet
none of this would be possible without using the oldest tool
available to a superintendent: careful cultivation of
relationships with the school board, the staff and the
community. In Westside, all of these stakeholders now
recognize that technology is an integral part of society and
that it must be part of our schools and the learning
process."

Westside Community Schools, 909 South 76th St., Omah, NE

PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICTS JOIN PROJECT
TO EXTEND VIDEOCONFERENCING ABILITY


   Six rural school districts in Northeast Pennsylvania
joined in a project using the technology of
videoconferencing to improve education opportunities for
their students.

   The school districts, working with three colleges,
experimented with videoconferencing during the 1994-95
school year, allowing rural, remote schools to expand high
school curriculums, offer college classes to high school
students, assist with staff development for local teachers
and offer career training and college classes to local
residents.

   While capable of offering a strong educational program,
the district was not able previously to offer the number and
diversity of courses available in suburban areas.

   The consortium recently applied for a five- year grant to
expand the videoconferencing network to 40 sites throughout
Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.

   Besides linking the involved schools with other schools,
the network has the potential to connect them to other
resources, such as museums, historic sites, art galleries
and performance centers.

   Typical of the districts involved in the program is the
Towanda Areas School District.

Learning Language

   In 1994, a teacher went to Towanda High School to teach
Japanese 101 to students from three different school
districts. In exchange for teaching the Japanese class, the
teacher made it possible for students at Towanda to receive
distance learning from other schools.

   Without videoconferencing, there would have been no
Japanese instruction because the number of students in one
school would not justify paying a teacher's salary for that
course.

   However, videoconferencing enabled the foreign-language
curriculum in six school districts to expand from French and
Spanish to include German I-III, Japanese, Russian and
Latin.

   Besides being a cost-effective way to enhance curriculum,
videoconferencing is helping students in the schools make
friends many miles away, according to a consortium
spokeswoman.

   The consortium also allowed high school students to take
college introductory classes in literature, anthropology,
psychology and fine arts available from College
Misericordia. The classes also were available to local
residents during day and evening hours.

   Teachers have taken advantage of some college credit
courses previously not available in their area and, in
addition to those classes, there are many opportunities for
teacher seminars.

   For more information on the Pennsylvania consortium,
contact Kimberly Scholtz at (603) 436-6690.

CANADIAN FIRM EXPLORES ADVANCES
IN DISTANCE-LEARNING TECHNOLOGY


   An advance in distance-learning technology is being
explored by the General DataComm (GDC) multimedia research
center in Montreal.

   Unlike most telecommunications networks, which are
designed for point-to-point connections, multimedia
applications such as distance learning and video
conferencing usually are multipoint.

   Recently, the research center announced, it previewed a
new product that supports the deployment of multipoint
multimedia services using existing network infrastructures.

   The not-yet-announced product, a powerful multimedia
multipoint server with multistandard and multibandwidth
capability, represents two years of design and development
work at the Montreal-based center.

   When completed, the new "video interactive product" is
expected to allow a broad range of multimedia services to be
deployed on a network, the center said.

   At the preview, musicians situated in remote locations in
Toronto, Montreal and Laval, Que., played instruments in
unison, successfully recreating the sound of a live
orchestra.

   As the musicians played, their images were joined on a
large projection screen set up at the preview for the
product.

   According to Shaker Sabri, vice president of the
Multimedia Research Center, the server's multimedia
functionality and multipoint connectivity will allow for
creation of "a broad range of services such as video
conferencing, distance learning and telemedicine."

   For more information on the server and other GDC work,
contact: General DataComm, 1579 Straits Turnpike,
Middlebury, CT 06762-1299; (203) 574-1118.

TELEPHONE COMPANY REDUCES RATES
IN INDIANA, MAKES GRANT IN WISCONSIN


   Ameritech donated $1.4 million to the Wisconsin Advanced
Telecommunications Foundation to underwrite grants for
technology projects in education and health care.

   The $40.5 million foundation, created last year after
passage of the Wisconsin Information Superhighway law, was
established to support advanced telecommunications projects
and educate users across the state. Funding will come from
the state's telecommunications companies.

   Ameritech, which provides telephone and other
communications services in five Midwest states, has
committed $13.5 million to the founda-tion over a seven-year
period.

   The company was the first telecommunications firm to
contribute to the foundation's endowment fund with a $1
million donation in 1995.

   In another development, the telephone company announced a
cut in its basic telephone rates in Indiana as part of the
company's "Opportunity Indiana" program.

   That program involves investment of money to extend two-
way interactive video links to all interested schools,
hospitals and major government centers in Ameritech's
Indiana service area.

   Nearly 60 schools throughout the state already have taken
advantage of Opportunity Indiana to extend advanced
communications links to their classrooms, Ameritech said.

   The links bring to nearly 200 the total number of Indiana
schools using Ameritech distance-learning technology to
extend the reach of their classrooms beyond their campuses.

   The technology allows students to take "electronic field
trips" to the Indianapolis Zoo and museums and allows
teachers to take continuing-education courses from their
school.

   In addition, as part of a six-year, $30 million Ameritech
contribution to the Corporation for Educational
Communications, an independent non-profit organization, 142
schools and supporting organizations have been awarded
grants that include funding for video equipment and
distance-learning curriculum development.

   For more information, contact Ameritech at (800) 242-
1553.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER OFFERS GRANTS
FOR HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHERS


   Wolfram Research, developer of the Mathematica software
for high school courses, is offering grants to help teachers
incorporate the program in their classes.

   Wolfram said it will provide grant recipients with a
scholarship for Mathematica training, copies of Mathematics
for High Schools for the recipient's school computer lab and
courseware development support for the school.

   Mathematica is used to teach mathematics courses at
several levels, including algebra, geometry and pre-
calculus. Students taking Mathemati-ca-based courses "are
spared the drudgery of performing tedious and repetitive
calculations by hand," according to Wolfram, and the program
aids in "better-understanding underlying concepts."

   Grant applications are available from: Wolfram Research,
100 Trade Center Drive, Champaign, IL 61820-7237; (217) 398-
0700; e-mail: <grants@wri.com>.

DISTRICT ACKNOWLEDGES ERROR, SETTLES
WITH STUDENT PUNISHED FOR INTERNET USE


   A Washington State school district reached a settlement
with a former student disciplined for writing a spoof of his
school and posting it on his World Wide Web home page.

   When the principal of Newport High School in the Seattle
suburb of Bellevue learned of the posting, she revoked the
school's recommendation of Paul Kim for a National Merit
scholarship and for college admissions.

   After Kim challenged the action, the Bellevue School
District acknowledged his free-speech rights on the Internet
were violated.

   Kathleen Taylor, director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Washington, which backed Kim in his challenge of
the district's punitive actions, said, "The district has
recognized that the principal had no authority to discipline
a student for expressing his opinions on his own time on a

   The district agreed to pay Kim $2,000, to seek to have
him reinstated as a National Merit finalist and to apologize
for punishing him. Kim's spoof, on his "Unofficial Newport
High School Home Page," lampooned his classmates as being
obsessed with sex. It also included links to other Internet
material with sexually explicit content.

MULTIMEDIA KIT ALLOWS STUDENTS
TO TRANSFER WORK OVER INTERNET


   Davidson's Kid Works Deluxe, a multimedia creativity kit
designed to help youngsters share their work via the
Internet, is available fom Davidson & Associates.

   The CD-ROM provides students pre-K through grade four
with innovative tools to write, illustrate, narrate and
publish their own stories, journals, letters and poems.

   Children also can hear their stories read aloud via the
multiple voices of First Byte's text-to-speech technology
that is included in the software.

   Youngsters then can share the creations - including all
the multimedia elements of Kid Works Deluxe, such as
animation, music, sound effects, character voices and the
child's own voice - with on-line friends via the Internet.

   If direct Internet access is available, the program
enables the user to send a work simply by selecting "Send
Story" from the File menu and entering the e-mail address in
the dialog box. To receive an incoming Kid Works Deluxe
story, the user clicks on the telephone symbol in the
program's interactive tree house.

   Additionally, the program's "Player" feature allows
children to save their innovations and then display them on
a different computer, even if Kid Works Deluxe is not loaded
on the other machine. Also, students can print their stories
- in color or black & white - and create their own books.

   The program is available in a combined Windows and
Macintosh CD-ROM format for a suggested retail price of
$89.95 for school versions, $199.95 for lab packs and
$899.95 for site licenses.

BOOK ADVISES TEACHERS ON INTEGRATING
INTERNET RESOURCES, SKILLS INTO CLASS


   A new book from Libraries Unlimited offers teachers
practical and simple advice on how to integrate Internet
resources and skills into curricula.

   The Internet and Instruction, Activities and Ideas, seeks
to demystify the technology of tele-communications and the
Internet. It provides relevant, feasible and easy-to-
implement ideas and activities for the classroom, the
publisher said.

   Emphasizing benefits to teachers, students, media
specialists and administrators, the authors guide users
through an overview of the technology and show them how to
get started and navigate the Internet. Each chapter begins
with a scenario demonstrating implementation of
telecommunications in an educational setting. Hardware,
software and navigational issues are discussed, with
detailed graphics illustrating the text.

   At the heart of the book are dozens of examples of
exemplary learning activities. The interdisciplinary
projects span the curriculum and encourage students to
explore the Internet while learning about a variety of
topics. Arranged by subjects, such as social studies, math
and music, the activities are presented in reproducible
format so they may be integrated easily into the curriculum.

   The book was written by Ann Barron, an associate
professor of instructional technology at the University of
South Florida's College of Education, and Karen Ivers, a
lecturer at the Department of Elementary and Bilingual
Education, California State University, Fullerton.

   Priced at $26.50, the book is scheduled for publication
in February. For more information, contact: Libraries

SOFTWARE PACKAGE ALLOWS CLASSES
TO SELF-PUBLISH STUDENT MATERIAL


   Schools can become mini-publishers, producing
inexpensive, hard-bound books of their students' work with
the School Publishing Package from the Children's Publishing
Center (CPC).

   Designed with the educator's time and the school
district's budget in mind, the CPC process "is simple,
speedy and reasonably priced," the company said. "Books can
be bound in just 60 seconds and cost about $1 per student
after the initial package is purchased."

   For $650, the publishing package includes computer
software, 100 book covers, binding material, an
instructional video and a guidebook. "All you need is a
computer, printer and a heavy-duty stapler," according to
CPC.

   Until April 30, CPC is offering a price of $475 per
package for purchases by three or more schools in a
district.

   CPC suggests schools can use the package to set up their
own on-campus publishing company, upgrade their computer
labs, sell student-published books for fundraising, feature
student-authored books in their library, or incorporate the
publishing activity into after-school programs.

JOSTENS OFFERS SCHOOLS NEW LINE
OF LEARNING MODULES FOR SCHOOLS


   In a move to help schools "ease into" the acquisition of
an integrated software-based curriculum, Jostens Learning is
offering a new Learning Modules product line.

   Learning Modules is a series of focused, integrated
curricula packages that allow schools to pick and choose the
curricula they need by subject matter and grade level to
build a schoolwide implementation system over time.

   The packages "offer all the advantages of comprehensive
networked curriculum without the high implementation costs
associated with a broad-based system," Jostens said.

   The modular offering is a departure for Jostens, which
previously sold its courseware in one large comprehensive
package, with the option of separate add-on tools, such as
Microsoft Works or multimedia encyclopedias.

   There are 12 learning modules in all, including Jostens
A+dvantage Management System, an operating system offering
schools the opportun-ity to run any software and curriculum
they desire, in addition to the Jostens Learning curriculum.

   Each learning module begins with the A+dvantage
Management System and then is combined with various pieces,
such as Research-Writing tools (2-6), Mathematics (4-6), or
Middle School Science.

   Another new module is A+dvantage Worldware, a teacher-
managed Internet connection that allows educators to
identify and link resources from around the globe with their
own software-based curriculum.

   For more information about the learning modules or to
receive a catalog, call (800) 244-0575.

NEW SOFTWARE DESIGNED TO EASE
DATABASE SEARCH ON COMPUSERVE


   Searching databases through CompuServe can be done more
efficiently with SmartSearch, a new search tool from the
Search Ware company, according to a company announcement.

Knowledge Index that combines advanced search technology
with cost-saving management functions.

selects a database, enters the search concepts and the order
of importance, and specifies the maximum number of
selections desired.

   The program has a built-in timer to limit maximum log-on
time and maintains a complete and up-to-the-minute record of
time charges.
