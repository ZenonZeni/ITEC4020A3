Subject: Meeting notes from ANSI X.9 Meeting on Electronic Payment Standard<br>
<p>
ABA Meeting of the X.9 ANSI Meeting 11/29/95, on Electronic Payments:<br>
Cindy Katzen (?) gave an introduction.  She said that the ANSI X.9 which is<br>
accredited to develop financial industry standards, has approved this work<br>
item on Electronic Payments.  X.9 has 6 subcommittees, 30 active working<br>
groups, and manage 70 standards, and technical specifications.  We do 5 year<br>
reviews on each.  Also they are the US technical advisory group to ISO<br>
Technical Committee 68 (TC68), and they also provide a secretariat.  TC68<br>
has 3 subcommittees.  Mark Zalewski of Cybercash is nominated chair for TC68.<br>
<p>
This is domestic standards development.  Define work and tell them what<br>
needs to be done.  If there does not need to be a domestic standard but an<br>
international one that is okay.  Intel has offered to provide a Chairperson,<br>
Tom Jones.<br>
<p>
Tom lead the meeting with the following agenda:<br>
Scope of work item<br>
Proposal to extend the work item into other areas<br>
2 presentations on other standards, Taher Elgamal on SEPP, and FSTC on Echeck<br>
<p>
The general purpose of this work item is to produce an American national<br>
standard on secure electronic payment syntax.  Since the group is large, Tom<br>
suggested nominating a small editing group of 6-10 people to put together a<br>
document and bring it back to the larger group.<br>
<p>
Tom said that he wanted to get through the work item in 18 months, and to do<br>
that there would have to be a draft in 9 months.  The following document was<br>
a strawman distributed to start discussion on a proposed X9 new work item.<br>
<p>
"Towards an American National Standard:  Secure Payment Syntax<br>
Scope:<br>
The payment syntax described in this standard is designed to order a<br>
Financial Institution to make a payment to a merchant from an account of a<br>
purchaser based on the near term delivery of low monetary  value goods or<br>
services.  It should be possible to include this payment order in any<br>
electronic protocol that is based on communications between the purchaser<br>
and the merchant, and between the merchant and a Financial Institution.<br>
This standard does not describe, nor recommend, any particular communication<br>
protocol.<br>
<p>
When used within a complete payment infrastructure, the secure payment order<br>
described below shall offer privacy and integrity of the purchaser's payment<br>
information, and shall prevent the purchaser from successfully repudiating<br>
the sending, or the merchant from successfully repudiating the receiving, of<br>
a valid payment order.  Non-repudiation of receipt will require secure<br>
acknowledgment messages.  Thus the Financial Institution can be sure that<br>
its customer requested the payment and that the merchant can be accurately<br>
identified on the account statement.<br>
<p>
Purpose:<br>
Consumers, operating from within their own home or business, have access to<br>
an increasingly wide range of electronic displays of merchant's wares.  The<br>
source of this electronic cornucopia can be provided by networked<br>
connections, broadcast or narrowcast TV, the physical distribution of<br>
electronic media, such as CD-ROM, or future media connections which are now<br>
only in the conceptual stage.  Regardless of the source of the information,<br>
there is an increasingly urgent demand that user's make the purchase<br>
decision directly from the electronic media, and the purchase decision be<br>
transmitted together with payment information to the merchant.  The merchant<br>
wants to receive the payment information prior to delivering the merchandise<br>
to cut down on fraud loss and the purchaser seems to want immediate access<br>
to the goods or services, purchased.<br>
<p>
This standard is intended to close the electronic loop by providing a secure<br>
means for the purchaser to make payment information available to the<br>
merchant, without revealing any secret information that could be used in a<br>
fraudulent manner to access the purchaser's accounts.  The payment<br>
information will only be accessible by the purchaser, and the purchaser's<br>
Financial Institution, but the merchant can be assured, in real-time, that<br>
payment will be honored by his Financial Institution.<br>
<p>
Content of the Payment Order:<br>
The fields required for the payment order are separated into the plain text<br>
segment and enciphered segment.<br>
<p>

<p>
Discussion on scope:<br>
<p>
The result of this group will be a message set and sequence diagram.  There<br>
will be a lot of work going into what is in those messages.<br>
<p>
There was some discussion about the use of the terms low monetary value and<br>
merchant.<br>
<p>
Graham asked if other payment flows would be considered.  Tom said that he<br>
wanted to have a scope that is small and easily achievable, so that is why<br>
we are focusing the flow from consumer to merchant to financial institution.<br>
<p>
Right now this cannot support cash, as it requires the consumer to have a<br>
bank account.  It can support credit or debit.<br>
<p>
There are a relatively small group of encryption algorithms about to be<br>
approved by X-9.<br>
<p>
Three have been approved:   DES,  Triple DES is in the works, RSA and<br>
Vhelman (?).  Digital Signature and Secure Hash is a standard; attribute<br>
lists are being worked on.  Security folks in X9f will be active in this<br>
work item.<br>
<p>
It may be necessary to specify encryption schemes.  Key exchange is quite<br>
different.  If you allow more than one, you get into interoperability<br>
problems.<br>
<p>
NSA representative said that the length of the encryption key should not be<br>
an issue, but what is encrypted should be of more concern for the group.<br>
The group should not limit this standard based on a regulation that could<br>
change in a few months.<br>
<p>
The 820 is complicated and could be used to accomplish this activity, but<br>
this work item is trying to come up with a relatively simple consumer<br>
oriented transaction.<br>
<p>
If you are going to say privacy, integrity and non-repudiation, then you<br>
will have to define cryptography.  X.9 has standards that define the<br>
cryptography protocols so we can reference them.<br>
<p>
The comments on the scope will be incorporated and a new draft will be<br>
submitted to the group for review.<br>
<p>
Will the usage specification operate with current regulation and clearing<br>
and settlement system?<br>
<p>
If you use Party A, Party B and a Bank, instead of using the term merchant,<br>
then you could move it in any way.  If there are 2 parties and only one<br>
bank, then this will not effect any clearing system.  If it is 2 parties and<br>
2 banks then the clearing system comes into play.<br>
<p>
Should the second bank be added to the scope?  Do we want to support flows<br>
between financial institutions.<br>
<p>
We need to rely on the banks to tell us if this is  implementable.  Dan<br>
suggested that the standard be expanded to support information exchanged<br>
between banks.<br>
<p>
Tom said that we should work to understood the needs of customers and limit<br>
ourselves to the problems that we know and not try and solve problems we<br>
don't know about.<br>
<p>
We can produce guidelines for reference implementations, but they are not<br>
part of the standard.  We encourage organizations that are developing<br>
implementations to advise us of any issues in implementing the standard.<br>
<p>
Tom said that he will do best to narrow the scope.  If any suggestion<br>
increases the scope significantly, I will recommend that they become a<br>
separate work item.<br>
<p>
Talk on SEPP:  John Gould of MasterCard said that the Secure Electronic<br>
Payment Protocol (SEPP) is intended to solve MC's business model.  We expect<br>
to conclude revision to the SEPP review process in less than 60 days.  We<br>
have a time pressure by customers and member banks to secure our brand<br>
products quickly.  We will be piloting the result hopefully with VISA and<br>
X9.  Take the SEPP document as an informational, living, document.  We will<br>
not know how good it is until we start to pilot it.<br>
<p>
Taher Elgamal, of Netscape, said that SEPP is a vertical solution rather<br>
than a horizontal message format.  SEPP solves the credit card transaction<br>
where there is a consumer, merchant and merchant's bank.  We were not trying<br>
to solve the world's payment problems.  Credit cards are the simplest model<br>
to use.  People feel comfortable because the liability is to the benefit of<br>
the consumer most of the time.  We tried to minimize the impact on the<br>
existing medium, banking protocols and networks.  The design is a front end<br>
to the existing bank network.<br>
<p>
We had to solve the authentication problem.  It is not really exactly known<br>
how this will work and if it will scale properly.  We tried not to change<br>
relationship between parties.  We started with a generic philosophy to use<br>
standards where they exist.<br>
<p>
SEPP will be implemented independently by different vendors that have to<br>
achieve interoperability.  The merchant does not have to see the credit card<br>
number even though he does today.  The payment/order has dual encryption.<br>
The payment instruction is opaque to the merchant.  The order details are<br>
not of interest to the bank.<br>
<p>
The message formats are the tools in SEPP, to achieve the product, that is<br>
useful.  There is an attempt to solve the grand picture.  The credit card<br>
system is complex.<br>
<p>
Does the merchant really need to know the identity of the consumer.  The<br>
merchant is only interested that the person is capable of using the amount.<br>
They may want to know, but they may not need to know.<br>
<p>
We built in an online certification system, which certifies consumers and<br>
merchants.   For SEPP, the acquiring bank does the certification.  Dan<br>
mentioned that this is not quite analogous to how it works in the paper model.<br>
<p>
Frank Jaffe spoke about Echeck.<br>
He said that the future is likely to bring more alternatives, not less.  We<br>
wanted to move the check to a paperless instrument.  Eliminate paper and use<br>
cryptographic methods to secure it.  We're looking at digital signatures to<br>
replace hand signatures.<br>
The Electronic Check supports multiple check flows.  Deposit and Clear<br>
(Normal) flow, Cash Check, Z flow, Lockbox flow, and transfer flow.<br>
Electronic Check supports multiple business models:  Certified Check flow,<br>
Interchange, Third Party Payer.<br>
Overview:<br>
-Develop a secure, all-electronic instrument modeled on paper check<br>
primarily for use in electronic commerce<br>
-Enable this instrument to be flexible and represent other physical<br>
instruments such as cashier's checks, traveler's checks<br>
-Develop a general programmatic set of tools and standard interfaces,<br>
protocols and formats so that E-Check functions can be used for other<br>
applications.<br>
-Test approach through a commercial pilot.<br>
<p>
We would like to develop a reference implementation and tools to make it<br>
easier to use it.<br>
<p>
Electronic Check objectives:<br>
-provide individuals and businesses a safe convenient debit payment option<br>
-use inexpensive public networks<br>
-enable merchants to automate complete transactions<br>
<p>
 We're not trying to specify encryption, to allow parties to use what they<br>
want.<br>
<p>
Key component summary:<br>
-hardware token for electronic and checkbook cryptographic key storage<br>
-digital signatures for transaction authentication<br>
-electronic certificates for account and bank authentication<br>
-secure hash for tamper-proofing<br>
-encryption for privacy is optional<br>
-remittance/invoice/order form included for automated accounts receivable<br>
processes<br>
-public networks for transmission<br>
<p>
The scope of the project is to issue payment orders against accounts in banks.<br>
If customer wants it, banks can afford it, and it can be done securely than<br>
why not?<br>
<p>
Tom started discussion again on the X.9 Work item.  He said that we need to<br>
address: what do customers want, what risks do banks want to take and how<br>
fast do you want to do it?<br>
<p>
The banking industry needs a protocol standard for electronic  payments.<br>
This could be the beginning of something bigger; define a scope for this<br>
work item, but as the beginning of a payment protocol.<br>
<p>
Frank suggested that the project should focus more than just consumer to<br>
merchant.<br>
<p>
Several people suggested trying to develop a more encompassing payment<br>
protocol than just consumer to merchant payments, because it is easier to<br>
design up front than redesign after it has been implemented.<br>
<p>
Others suggested that we ought to start with something manageable, like<br>
debit or credit cards, but not design ourselves into a corner.<br>
<p>
If this group does not address payment types, than client software will have<br>
to identify between payment types and what merchants and/or banks take what.<br>
<p>
Taher pointed out that SEPP will not do debit cards well.<br>
<p>
Will consumers use account based systems in the volume that you expect?<br>
<p>
Many agreed that speed is important, and encouraged staying focused for time<br>
considerations.<br>
<p>
There was a suggestion to have separate groups developing payment syntax for<br>
credit, debit, echeck.<br>
<p>
One suggestion was to help the consumer to quickly negotiate a payment<br>
system of choice.<br>
<p>
Spending time on credit seems to make sense since it is more widely used on<br>
the Internet.<br>
<p>
NACHA is addressing the check issue.<br>
<p>
Tom summarized the discussion saying that it appeared that most agreed to<br>
stay cognizant of all issues, but focus on the credit model and allow the<br>
architecture to expand.<br>
<p>
We should find what is in common to all payment systems.  Make it modular to<br>
add on types or variations.<br>
Someone suggested a steering committee to address these extensions.<br>
<p>
Tom proposed an editing group of 6-10 people to get document out on the<br>
credit model.  He proposed having a meeting of the editing group on January<br>
16th in San Francisco.<br>
<p>
The full group will meet Feb. 29th at Cylink in Sunnyvale.<br>
and tentatively June 7th in Boston at the Fed.<br>
<p>
However other groups would like to deal with the other issues is up to them.<br>
<p>
FSTC will find a way to work with this committee through their joint<br>
membership.<br>
<p>
Tom asked Frank to feed back to X9 how FSTC wants to fit Echeck into this<br>
work group.<br>
<p>
All this work item was written to deal with is the syntax, we are not going<br>
to deal with the protocol.   There would be a multiplicity of protocols that<br>
would use it, phone, modem, http.<br>
<p>
SEPP has an application protocol that is independent of communications.<br>
<p>
Mohammad Khan volunteered to lead a group to discuss management issues<br>
including negotiation.  VISA, MC, Discover, IBM, and Cybercash volunteered<br>
to participate in that group.<br>
