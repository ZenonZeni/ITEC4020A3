<p align="center"><b>U.S. Sentencing Commission's Recommendations
Regarding Marijuana Weight Disparity Enacted Into Law: New
Legislation Could Affect Approximately 950 Imprisoned Marijuana
Growers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 1, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Recommendations made by the U.S. Sentencing Commission this past
spring mandating a universal plant-weight ratio for marijuana was
enacted into law on November 1.&nbsp; The recommendation will be
retroactive and will affect an estimated 950 cases across the
nation dating back to 1989.&nbsp; Many of these prisoners will be
eligible for early release due to the amended guidelines;
however, Families Against Mandatory Minimum's (FAMM) spokesman
Jeff Stewart cautions that the decision to release an inmate
early still remains up to the discretion of each individual
judge.&nbsp; While it's true that nearly 1000 inmates will be affected
by the change, it does not necessarily follow that all of those
inmates will be immediately released, FAMM warns. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the newly amended guidelines, each marijuana plant
cultivated will now be given a weight equivalent to 100 grams
regardless of the number of plants involved.&nbsp; In the past,
the 100 grams per plant measure was only mandated when a
defendant was convicted of possessing 49 plants or fewer. For
those convicted of harboring 50 plants or more, the weight
equivalent for each plant jumped to 1000 grams.&nbsp;
Consequently, defendants convicted for possessing 50 plants or
more faced sentences almost 3 times as long as those convicted
for 49 plants. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts
the equivalency of 100 grams per marijuana plant for all
guidelines determinations,&quot; the commission stated.&nbsp; The
commission voted 7-0 in favor of the change. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A bill blocking the commission's recommendations was introduced
by U.S. Representative Jim Bunn (R-OR) in October, but Congress
failed to act on it. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Buchanan Flip-Flop-Flips On Medical
Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Storm Lake, IA:</b>&nbsp;
When it comes to the issue of medical marijuana, presidential
hopeful Pat Buchanan just can't seem to make up his mind. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While fund-raising in Charlotte, NC this past summer, Buchanan
responded to a question posed by MAPS (Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies) President Rick Doblin about
whether he would &quot;support the use of medical
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, Buchanan stated that:
&quot;If a doctor indicated to his patient that this was the only
way to alleviate certain painful symptoms ... I would defer to
the doctor's judgment.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, when confronted with a similar question at a recent
gathering in Storm Lake, Iowa, Buchanan began singing a different
tune.&nbsp; When approached by a citizen and publicly asked about his
views on the medicinal use of marijuana, Buchanan said that he
felt that doctors should not be permitted to prescribe smoking
marijuana because of its destructive effect.&nbsp; Buchanan then
asked the man if he was with NORML.&nbsp; When the citizen
responded that he wasn't, but rather that he was &quot;terminally
ill patient ... [with] no hope and no treatment,&quot;&nbsp;
Buchanan suddenly flipped yet again on the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If everything you say is true, and I choose to believe
you,&quot; Buchanan said, &quot;[then] I would support [your
decision to use marijuana as a medicine] in a second.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Idaho Supreme Court Rules That Employee Let
Go For Failing Drug Test<br>
Should Be Awarded Unemployment Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Idaho:</b>&nbsp; In a
surprising 3-2 decision, the Idaho Supreme Court has ruled that
an employee who was fired after having tested positive for THC
should be eligible for unemployment benefits.&nbsp; In it's
written opinion, the Court concluded that: &quot;The record
presents substantial and competent evidence to support the
Commission's conclusion that Shearer [Lumber Products] failed to
communicate its expectations to [its employee, Steven]
Merriott.&nbsp; Shearer therefore could not require Merriott to
comply with uncommunicated expectations.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;uncommunicated expectations&quot; in this case had to
do with whether or not it was clear that Merriott's conduct while
off-duty could be construed as appropriate grounds for
dismissal.&nbsp; After testing positive for THC on a February 9,
1993, drug test, Merriott admitted that he had smoked marijuana
during his day off two days earlier.&nbsp; Merriott maintained
that he had not been intoxicated while on the job.&nbsp; He was
later fired on February 16, 1993, for violating Shearer Lumber
Products' substance abuse policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon analysis, the Court decided that although the company's
substance abuse policy prohibited employees &quot;from being
under the influence of any chemical substance or alcohol during working
hours,&quot; it did not make reference to what employees may or
may not do during non-working hours.&nbsp; &quot;The Commission
noted that Shearer presented no evidence that Merriott was impaired
while at work, nor was Merriott informed that use of controlled
substances during non-working hours would violate Shearer's
policy.&nbsp; Because there was no evidence that Merriott did not
comply with Shearer's communicated substance abuse policy, the
Commission concluded that Merriott was not discharged for
employment-related misconduct.&nbsp; ... [Therefore,] the Commission's
conclusion that Merriott is eligible for unemployment benefits is
affirmed.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Northcoast NORML Launches Campaign<br>
To Kill Proposed Ohio Bill That Allows Police To Sell Drugs</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 30, 1995, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Northcoast NORML has launched an educational campaign to inform
citizens about a proposed House Bill that would change Ohio's
long standing policy prohibiting law enforcement personnel from
selling less than the bulk amount of an illegal drug in reverse
sting operations.&nbsp; The bill (H.B. 125) is titled
&quot;Violations of the Drug Laws&quot; and is being sponsored by
State representative Jeff Jacobson (R-Dayton) by the request of
Montgomery County law enforcement officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML is concerned about this proposed legislation for
various reasons.&nbsp; Most of all, NORML is worried that this
bill, if enacted into law, would shift the focus of Ohio's drug
war away from traffickers and onto small time users.&nbsp;
&quot;If the Senate passes House Bill 125, it will be open season
in Ohio for drug users,&quot; stated Northcoast NORML President
John Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;With the State prison system [already
operating] at over 170 percent capacity and many county jails bursting
at the seams, ... [it's clear that] we just don't need more drug
users in prison.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML also notes that a change in the law could cause
law enforcement personnel to unintentionally add to the drug
problem in Ohio. Hartman notes that an October 25, 1994, Orange
County Register article (Defense Wants Crack Cases Killed, Peter
M. Gollner) reported that 42 percent of the people who bought
drugs from undercover officers got away with the police
manufactured drugs. <br>
