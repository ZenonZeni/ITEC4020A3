DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</CENTER></H3>

<P>Dietary vitamin A intake is strongly and inversely associated with the risk of
mortality. It is especially vital for children with respiratory problems. This information
supports an important role for dietary vitamin A in reducing childhood mortality in
developing countries.

<P>Although there is no doubt that the death and disease rates of third-world countries
present more serious problems than ours, there are about two dozen countries whose
statistics involving childbirth and children's health are superior to those of the United
States!  So you have a better chance of having a healthy baby, for example, in at least
twenty other countries than you do here! This is shocking and never should have happened. 
We must act to change these statistics. For starters, we can pay attention to the vitamin A
status of our own children.

<P>It has presently been proposed that vitamin A may be a simple and cost-effective
strategy for reducing the transmission of the HIV virus from infected mothers to their
babies in this country!  Vitamin A deficiency affects the integrity of the vaginal lining,
immune cell function, antibody concentrations, and even breast-milk quality.

Periodontal disease affects 80 percent of all adults and causes more tooth loss than
dental decay, according to new research disclosed at the Eighth International Symposium on
the Biomedical and Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme Q-10, held in Stockholm.

<P>Research showed that many cases of periodontal disease can be successfully treated using
a nutritional substance, Coenzyme Q-10, in place of traditional periodontal treatment!

<P>More than 20 years ago dental research showed that patients suffering from periodontal
disease have low levels of Coenzyme Q- 10 in the tissues surrounding their teeth. Since
then, several studies have shown definite improvement in periodontal disease as a result of
Coenzyme Q-10 supplementation.

<P>Coenzyme Q-10 is a vitamin-like substance which is present in every cell of the human
body and is an important part of energy production. It is also an important antioxidant,
combating the free radicals involved in the activity of a number of diseases, including
cancer and heart disease. After six weeks of treatment with Coenzyme Q-10, significant
changes were shown in plaque levels, pocket depth, and bleeding tendency; slight improvement
was also noted in tooth mobility.

        Dr. Irfan Mian, chairperson of the London Federation of Dentists, said, "Save the gums,
save the teeth, and you are actually preventing a whole range of illnesses."
