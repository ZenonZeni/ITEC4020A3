<HR> 
Through a series of research articles on inclusion, Schumm & Vaughn (1995) have noted that modifications in teaching are preferred not only by students classified as low achieving, but by students classified as high achieving as well. These include modifications in teaching style/practice, and modifications in textbooks. The authors have summarized these modifications as follows:
