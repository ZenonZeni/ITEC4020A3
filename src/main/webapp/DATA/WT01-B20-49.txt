<p align="center"><b>Jimmy Montgomery Now Suffering In Solitary
Confinement<br>
Medical Neglect Threatens Life</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 24,</b> Isolated in a cell with no way
even to call for help, paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery endures the
stench of his untreated infections, suffers the pain of having to
tear off soiled bandages without any salve or ointments, and runs
the risk of life-threatening kidney and bladder infections because
guards cannot find the urine bag that his mother sent him.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Governor Keating's office claims to be doing
everything possible. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Governor Keating may be reluctant to look closely at the facts of
the Montgomery case.&nbsp; His office keeps telling callers that
Montgomery must have done something far worse than the trial records
indicate, because they do not want to believe that good people in
a small town, serving as jurors, could have done something so
terrible.&nbsp; He may be reluctant to recognize that the hate propaganda
fostered by the prohibitionist ideology that he espouses could
result in such a great injustice.&nbsp; Governor Keating should
spend a few minutes reviewing the record and then go and visit Jimmy's
prison cell and see and smell the stench of his lesions.&nbsp;
Then he might find the power and the courage to face the
consequences of hatred.&nbsp; The good people of Oklahoma have
been the victims of a crime of unspeakable evil, but it is
necessary to say that we are not damned by the evil done to us,
but rather by the evil done by us.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;The world is a dangerous place to live --
not because of the people who are evil but because of the people
who don't do anything about it.&quot;&nbsp; --Albert Einstein</p>

If not, please do at (405)521-2342!</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b>San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Supports
Medicinal Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 23,</b> The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>
opined, &quot;What a sense of justice and relief many AIDS,
cancer, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis patients felt last year
when both houses of the state Legislature passed a bill allowing
them to use marijuana to ease their pain and nausea.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But their victory was short-lived.&nbsp; Despite its legislative
approval after substantive hearings, Gov. Wilson vetoed the
bill.&nbsp; Let us hope that in this non-election year,
compassion and good sense rule and that an identical measure by
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose, passes and, this time,
is signed by Wilson.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The measure is narrowly drawn and would ... simply allow
suffering patients -- with a doctor's approval -- to possess or
cultivate marijuana for personal use.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The editorial concluded, &quot;The patients' hopes were raised,
then dashed, last year.&nbsp; A repeat of that cruel outcome <u>is
not acceptable</u>.&quot;&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.] <br>

initiative underway in California, please contact Californians

<p align="center"><b>Court Clears Way For NORML Medical Marijuana
Lawsuit And Rally In Anaheim</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 24,</b> <i>USA Today</i> reports &quot;A
judge temporarily restrained the city [of Anaheim] from enforcing
a law that closes its parks to convicted drug offenders [Yes,
even marijuana convictions! -ed.].&nbsp; It allows the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws to rally at La
Palma Park Thursday.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on the lawsuit and rally, please contact
either CA NORML, Dale Gieringer, (415) 563-5858 or LA NORML,

<p align="center"><b><u>SPECIAL APPEAL</u></b><b>: Help Medical
Marijuana Patients In Washington State</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier in the month, NORML reported that
Seattle's Green Cross Cannabis Buyer's Club were arrested.&nbsp;
The patients and some of the principles involved in the club are
now facing criminal charges for aiding the sick and dying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Please</i> consider sending a donation for their legal defense
as soon as possible.&nbsp; The cost of their legal defense could
top $75,000!&nbsp; NORML National Legal Committee member Jeffrey Steinborne's
law firm is handling the case.&nbsp; Send desperately needed
contributions to Green Cross Defense Fund, 800 5th Ave. #162,
Seattle, WA 98408.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>A Classic Example Of Permissible Hate Speech
With A Recent Echo</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Congressional prohibitionists brought former
First Lady Nancy Reagan back to Washington in March to revive the
&quot;Just Say No&quot; mantra.&nbsp; They did not ask her to
repeat her 1988 statement: &quot;If you are a drug user, you're
an accomplice to murder.&quot;&nbsp; (Page 5 of the Final Report
of <i>THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE FOR A DRUG FREE AMERICA</i>.
-June 1988)&nbsp; Perhaps this is just as well considering that
page 6 of the report says &quot;Each time we do not get outraged
over senseless death and violence we are guilty.&quot;&nbsp; This
might suggest that they are guilty for their indifference to the
suffering of Jimmy Montgomery and the recent law enforcement
killings of marijuana users in Wisconsin.&nbsp; These do not seem
to be matters for concern -- much less -- outrage for anyone in
Washington or the national media.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Cause and Effect: Imprisoning Non-violent
Drug Offenders<br>
</b><b><u>Doubles</u></b><b> Local Jail Populations In Just 10
Years!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In May, the Associated Press reported, &quot;The
number of inmates in local jails across the nation reached a
record 490,442 last year...&nbsp; <u>The rising number of drug
offenders was the biggest reason for the increase</u> ... with
more than 105,800 of the 1993 jail inmates were charged or
convicted of drug crimes.&quot;&nbsp; African Americans have an
incarceration rate nine times that of other races.&nbsp; Presently,
in the U.S. there are an estimated 1.5 million individuals
incarcerated.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Brown Escalates Potent Pot Follies<br>
Claims 40 Fold Increase In THC Levels!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 21,</b> In an interview with the <i>Dallas
Morning News</i>, Drug Czar Lee Brown was asked, &quot;Why is it
more dangerous for a kid to be experimenting with drugs now than
when the baby boomers were in high school or college?&quot;&nbsp;
Brown responded, &quot;The major illegal drug they're experimenting
with is marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana is 40 times more potent today
than was the case 10, 15, 20 years ago...&nbsp; I don't think
that young people know that.&nbsp; It is really not getting
covered very well.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In other recent statements Brown has claimed that
potency has increased only 6 to 10 fold.&nbsp; He did not offer
any explanation for this escalation, nor did he offer any
explanation for why he is contradicting Alan Leshner, the head of
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) who says that potency
is only 3 times higher than in the past.&nbsp; Brown also did not
explain why the only large scale testing of contraband marijuana,
sponsored by NIDA, shows no increase in potency since the early
1980's.&nbsp; As for it not being reported, the potent pot myth
has been repeated in almost every major publication in
America.&nbsp; It has become the single most accepted lie about
marijuana in the mainstream media.&nbsp; Recently, both <i>NEW
YORK</i> magazine and syndicated columnist George Will have
claimed that potency is 15 times higher than in the past.&nbsp;
Ironically, the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> cut that one sentence
from the Will column.&nbsp; NORML finds no valid evidence of any increase
in average potency.</p>
