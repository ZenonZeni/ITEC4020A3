<p><strong>New Residential Water Heating Technology Demonstrated at 
Fort Stewart</strong>

<p>Gas-Fired Products' Seahorse, a natural gas hot water conversion 
system, was installed in base housing at Fort Stewart, near 
Savannah, Georgia, and monitored from April through November of 
1994.

<p><em>Seahorse is relatively recent addition to residential water 
heating market</em>

<p>The Seahorse gas hot water conversion system is a relatively 
recent addition to the residential water heating market that allows 
a residence or small building to easily convert an existing electric 
resistance water heater to a water heating system fueled by natural 
gas or propane.  The Seahorse consists of a natural-gas-fired 
tankless water heater and a small water pump, housed in a metal case 
installed outside the home.  The conversion system includes adapters 
which allow plumbing the input and output water flows from the 
Seahorse to the existing electric hot water tank.

<p>The heater is equipped with a freeze protection device 
(freezestat), which will turn on the pump and circulate the water in 
the system for a short period of time during sub-freezing 
conditions.  Auxiliary freeze protection, available as an accessory, 
has been used in the solar industry as freeze protection for over 25 
years, and does not require any electricity.

<p>The Seahorse has a nominal gas input of 60,000 Btu/h and is 
available in either propane or natural gas models.  According to 
Robert Glass, Vice President of Engineering and Manufacturing, 
Gas-Fired Products, the large input is about twice the input of a 
standard gas water heater, so it lends itself to innovative 
installations.  For example, Gas-Fired Products has hooked one 
Seahorse to multiple storage tanks, and has also used the technology 
for both home heating and water heating.  In addition, the American 
Gas Association has certified the Seahorse for installations 
including manufactured (mobile) homes.  

<p><em>Seahorse evaluated using several parameters</em>

<p>The Seahorse system was installed in a three-bedroom, 
two-bathroom duplex, with approximately 1,300 ft2 floor area; two 
adults and two children occupy the home.  Hot water use is limited 
to three sinks, two tub/showers, a clothes washer, and a 
dishwasher.  The technology was installed in March of 1994 and 
monitored until November of 1994.  

<p>The Seahorse installed in the demonstration used a two-stage gas 
valve and a direct spark ignition device to ignite the gas flame.  
The thermostat used to trigger operation of the Seahorse can be 
either the original tank thermostat or a submersible thermostat or 
aquastat supplied by Gas-Fired Products.

<p>Through the demonstration, staff of the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory measured the electric and gas consumption of the 
Seahorse, the hot water energy supplied to the storage tank by the 
Seahorse, and the hot water energy supplied to the house from the 
storage tank.  From this data, researchers generated a performance 
map relating the energy consumption of the Seahorse to the 
residential hot water energy requirements as well as the outside 
temperature.

<p>The researchers then used the performance map to calculate the 
efficiency of the Seahorse and the Seahorse/hot water tank system.  
The cost to meet typical hot water requirements with the Seahorse 
system and the cost to meet the same requirements with conventional 
electric and gas residential water heaters were then compared on a 
life-cycle cost basis.

<p><em>Hot water delivery efficiencies included in demonstration 
results</em> 

<p>The average hot water consumption during the testing period was 
60.7 gal/day resulting in a hot water energy use of 28,100 Btu/day 
or 68% of the Department of Energy's estimate for typical 
residential hot water energy consumption.  The average hot water 
delivery temperature to the residence during the testing period was 
128 F.  

<p>The final average hot water delivery-to-residence efficiency of 
the Seahorse system (system implies the new technology and existing 
tank combined) was determined to be 46.8%.  High standby losses and 
the relatively low hot water consumption contributed to the 
relatively low delivery-to-residence efficiency recorded during this 
test.  Much of the standby losses could be reduced through the 
addition of a simple check valve, which would increase the 
delivery-to-residence efficiency in future Seahorse installations.

<p>The final average hot water delivery-to-tank efficiency 
(Seahorse alone) was determined to be 77.4%.  The delivery-to-tank 
efficiency is defined as the hot water energy provided by the 
Seahorse to the hot water storage tank, divided by the gas energy 
input to the Seahorse.  The manufacturer obtained an average thermal 
efficiency of 83.9% as determined by an independent laboratory.  

<p>Observation of the demonstration unit suggests that attaining 
this efficiency level requires properly setting the Seahorse 
temperature control during installation.  Larger thermostat 
differentials between the Seahorse and tank reduce the cycling of 
the Seahorse unit and provide higher efficiency.  Short cycling 
times and sporadic cycling occurred during the earlier stages of the 
demonstration, allowing researchers to try several compensatory 
strategies.  Because reduced efficiency and short-cycling operation 
occurred when the tank thermostat was used for control, the 
demonstration results indicate that an aquastat be used for any new 
Seahorse installations.

<p><em>Seahorse system nets significant life-cycle energy 
cost-savings of $778</em>

<p>Based on the measured performance, the Seahorse gas hot water 
conversion technology demonstrated at Fort Stewart was estimated to 
net a life-cycle energy cost-savings of $778 for a typical residence 
at that site with a hot water consumption equivalent to 64.3 
gallons/day of 135 F water.  The estimate was calculated using 
avoided energy costs of $0.025/kWh for electricity, $8.85/kW for 
electric demand, and $0.30/therm for natural gas.

<p>Based on national average electrical costs of $0.0867/kWh and 
natural gas costs of $0.604/therm, the life-cycle energy cost 
savings for the Seahorse system would be $1,365.

<p>After analysis, the cost-savings were not enough to offset the 
initial estimated installation costs of $835 at the Fort Stewart 
location.  Marginally higher water consumption or electric energy 
costs would make the technology a life-cycle cost effective retrofit 
for electric water heaters at Fort Stewart.

<p><em>Seahorse proves comparable to tank-type gas water heaters, 
with potential for greater efficiency</em>

<p>A comparison of the Seahorse performance with more typical 
tank-type gas water heaters suggests that the installed 
Seahorse/hot water tank system at Fort Stewart performed at roughly 
the same level of efficiency as a typical 40- gallon gas water 
heater with an energy factor of 0.54, the minimum efficiency level 
allowed for installation at a federal site.  Improvements in system 
design in the present generation of Seahorse units may make new 
Seahorse models more efficient than base tank-type gas water heaters.  In
addition, installation of a check-valve in the Seahorse flow loop would also
improve the Seahorse efficiency beyond what was measured in the Fort Stewart
demonstration.  Similar levels of improvement are available in residential
tank-type gas water heaters but often at higher costs.

<p>Based on the measured data, the author of the technical report on 
the demonstration, Dave Winiarski of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,
recommends that the decision to purchase a Seahorse versus a tank-type gas water
heater be based primarily on capital and installation cost consideration.  A
life-cycle cost comparison with gas-fired, tank-type water heaters will depend
heavily on the installation costs for the tank-type gas water heaters,
particularly the cost of providing an exhaust flue for ventilation of the gas 
water heater.  

In the technical report, Mr. Winiarski presents two nomographs, one 
showing the electric and natural gas costs leading to a positive net
 present value for the Seahorse conversion, and one illustrating 
which gas water heater type would be more cost effective based on 
the cost to provide a flue system for the tank-type water heater.

<p><em>Demonstration indicates that Seahorse is robust technology</em>

<p>In conclusion, the Seahorse gas hot water conversion system 
appears to be a robust technology for which there are cost-effective 
applications in the federal sector.  Federal energy managers 
supervising areas with the right combination of energy costs should 
consider the Seahorse as an alternative to electric resistance water 
heaters for residences that have natural gas or propane gas 
available to them.
