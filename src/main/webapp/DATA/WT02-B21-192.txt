<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>dont squeeze the juice mother fucker
<LI>OJ is guilty
<LI>Money bought him freedom and an uneducated jury
<LI>It was all race and money that let him win.
<LI>oj is guilty but the best of the state blew it he is/should be completely exonerated and not be subject to the "double jeaoperdy" he now faces.
<LI>WHY DON`T THEY LET THE  TRIAL DIE  OK TI`S OVER.  
<LI>The jury was not tuned to the real issue of justice
<LI>What a farce!!  He did it and now thumbs his nose at the world!
<LI>I think the verdict in the trial was correct. A lot of people particulary white people don't give the jury the credit they deserve.  They said they were incompetant and were only trying to get back at the LAPD.  This Jury did the best with the evidence they were given, not to mention the defence team was excellent while the prosecution sucked!  I am very happy that O.J. Simpson won this trial and hopefully will realize that white people are crazy, vengeful, rude, intolerant, and they also have no faith
  I am glad the man or the Black man got something in his favor for once.
<LI>I don't understand why the media thought a considerable portion of viewers wanted to see and hear about O.J. at least once during most of our waking hours.
<LI>I think it is sad that a murderer walks the streets today due to ruthless tactics made by the defense
<LI>when i say that race was a factor, I mean that if the jury had NOT acquitted him, they would have been accused of racism
<LI>O J Simpson was guilty without question!! The verdict was atravisity of justice.
<LI>I've come up with a few theories on this.  A.C did it to frame O.J; Ron killed Nicole so O.J killed him; the dog did it; O.J stalked and killed Nicole and upon finding her with Ron, killed him too.
<LI>I have always believed in OJ's innocence.
<LI>The evidence is against him,  the civil trial will prove this,  a quick message to OJ: "What goes around,  comes around,  and yours is just about due"
<LI>MEDIA IS WHY OJ WAS THOUGHT TO BE GUILTY
<LI>oj did not murder anyone, however HE does know who did.!!!
<LI>OJ  killed the mother of his children, and got away with it !
<LI>orchestrated coverup of cia involvement in drugs in la  and police compliance with the cia    coverup  headed up in  d.c.
<LI>I live Brentwood, I avoid him at all cost..he got away with murder
<LI>The legal SYSTEM itself works.  It wasn't meant to be perverted by crybaby jurors, liberal lawyers, and corrupt politicians who are more scared of riots than seeing justice served.
<LI>It is my hope that somehow, these comments get to both OJ and the members of the prosecution and defense teams involved. It is hoped that Judge Ito will seriously review and institute practices of control in the courtroom.  Had this been done from the beginning, I don't think the trial might have been quite the media circus that it was, nor would the main issue of the trial have been so fragmented.  I think televised trials are beneficial, but not when the Judge cannot control his own courtroom.  In th
s instance, Judge Ito has done more to shake my faith in the justice system than any legal representative present.
<LI>Guilty people are not always convicted.  I think he was guilty but he had a fair trial and was found not guilty.  We can't judge the justice system on one case.
<LI>I have learned it is next to impossible to form an educated opinion from just the data you receive from the press, there is always a twist or false information given.
<LI>The verdict indicates,to me, how wide the division between races is in this country.  Blacks still think he is innocent, whites still think he is guilty.
<LI>This survey is outdated. I thought you were talking about the current civil trial. I think O.J. got away with murder. Before I thought he did it himself. Now I think he may have planned it and had the assistance of Al Cowlings . I think his older son knew SOMETHING and was keeping it secret because he wanted to protect his father. His son's demeanor after the verdict was announced seemed peculiar, he was very emotional & looked distracted(because he had something bothering his conscience perhaps?) 
<LI>no
<LI>The prosecution did not prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, so the jury could not convict.  However, I don't believe that this means the defendant was innocent.
<LI>I think it's sad that the jury felt OJ was one of them, since he's not lived as a black man since high school, and I feel he and Johnnie Cochran used the race card in the worst way.  It isn't fair to good black people.  Also, I think OJ needs to face up to what he's done, but he's always gotten away with everything.  If LAPD is guilty of anything, it's that they never arrested him before, and he thought he could just do anything he wanted and he'd get away with it.  And he did!
<LI>The main point why the thing become so popular is not if OJ killed Nickol but if one can get through through the trial just because he is A. black  B. rich  C. famous .
<LI>Millionaires have rarley ever been conviced of murder.
<LI>shocked by media bias and sloppy reporting
<LI>the justice system is not about guilt or innocense but about winning the case. poor people are in jail and the rich are free
<LI>Stuipid.Ihate O.J.Iwill not even drink ornge juice no more.deat h to O.J.
<LI>were all in trouble
<LI>IF IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE, THE TRIAL WOULD HAVE ENDED MUCH SOONER THEN IN THIS SAD DEMONSTRATION OF OUR NATION'S LEGAL SYSTEM.
<LI>IT'S A SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>O.J. had to go free under American law, but the trial was a travesty of justice. People should read "Guilty" by Judge Harold J. Rothwax for more info on the collapse of American justice. 
<LI>This trial was a complete setback for both race relations and the U.S. justice system.
<LI>I think O.J. was a rich, sly man who weasled his way through the system.
<LI>that the planting of the glove was even allowed to be brought into court when there was only  one ever seen at the at the bundy scene.too many unsubstantiated theories allowed in the court case. This only distracts the jury from dealing with the facts of the case.
<LI>As a law student, I understand the defense's purpose. I now truly am disqusted with OJ as a person. As C. darden summed it up, "He will one day face up to the truest judge."
<LI>I can't believe that bastard got away with double murder.  I hope he knows he will burn in eternal hell for what he's done.
<LI>Ummm no comment
<LI>I think it's pretty obvious to anyone what occurred here, but it's too politically incorrect to talk about on the Internet.
<LI>The whole process sucked.
<LI>This whole thing has been blown out of proportion.  O.J. Simpson was acquitted the first time because he's O.J. SIMPSON!  That is the only reason.  If he were some unknown black man, he'd be on death row right now, whether he did it or not!
<LI>OJ didit and i think that slick johnny confused the jury and had no chose to rule the way they did.
<LI>Die OJ Die
<LI>don't squeeze the juice, baby!
<LI>the trial was dumb
<LI>Uh, the flaming goat of the ancient sun god Ra has declared this web page sanctified ground.
<LI>pickles are a man best freind
<LI>O.J. is GUILTY.  Anyone who says he is innocent is either uninfomed, an idiot, or a racist.  Hopefully he will lose the civil trial.
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!!!!!!!
<LI>I got tired of hearing about the stupid trial, O.J's guilty send him to prison
<LI>Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty, Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilt
<LI>This trial was conspiracy. O.J. is a guilty mother fucker, lets give him the electric chair.   "Juan Valdez"
<LI>even if the jury would have had a 10 x 12 glossy of oj doing the deed. they still would have found him not guilty.
<LI>O.J. Simpson should be castrated and forced to eat his genitals and then drawn and quartered.
<LI>why is there no cut in the gloves that o.j. was supposed to be wearing during the murders???
<LI>never have so many lies and liars been together in the same room
<LI>O.J. is not Guilty!  He was even found Not-Guilty.  The media is going out of control!  Get it guys he is N-O-T G-U-I-L-T-Y!!!
<LI>Justice has not been served!!!!!!!
<LI>O.J. can suck my big johnson
<LI>THE JUDICAL SYSTEM FAVORS THE RICH NOT RACE.
<LI>Until O. J. Simpson became a suspect--"the sole murderer" I really believed a person in this country was innocent until found guilty by a jury of his peers.  He was found not guilty but the jury which found him not guilty has simply been ignored by Clark, Garcetti, many  people in the media, etc.  I have had many young adult foreign exchange students live in my home for many years.  They ask lots of questions about our country--until Simpson became a suspect I always told the students thar in this coun
ry a person is innocent until proven guilty.  I don't have any idea how to answer questions about our legal system--a new aspect of which includes the D. A.'s ability to announce over national T.V. the guilt of a person who hadn't even seen a court room yet.  I'm very confused about how the prosecution, news media, etc. have been allowed to judge Simpson regardless of the jury's finding.What happened to words like 'alleged'.  I think 
<LI>I wish that some of these o.j. suporters would start looking at the evidence and not just the wild acusations and impossible theories of the defence.
<LI>HOPEFULLY THE CIVIL TRIAL WILL PROVE O.J. GUILTY
<LI>Who cares who killed Nicole!  She was a tramp and everyone knew it!
<LI>i believe because o.j. had money and could afford the best lawyers that is why he got off. Also got off because he is a big ex-football star.
<LI>JUSTICE IS FOR THE RICH.  THE LAW IS TO CONTROL THE POOR.
<LI>The evidence was so obvious! The defence had only theories-- no proof of anything.  Fuhrman should have been out of the force if he was a racist but noone proved to me he planted a thing.
<LI>The media's participation was unfortunate- especially 4 the victims!
<LI>THE ENTIER FUCKING BROWN FAMILY SHOULD HANG FOR LEACHING OF OJ WHEN NICOLE WAS ALIVE AND NOW LEACHING OF THE PUBLICITY OF NICOLS DEATH.  AND . . FRED GOLDMAND SHOULD SHUT HIS FUCKING MOUTH.  I'M SICK OF HEARING THAT FUCKING JEW!!
<LI>Stop beating a dead horse.
<LI>money talks bull- - - -  walks
<LI>Sue LAPD
<LI>no answer!!!
<LI>Truth is a moving target, hairs to split and pieces that don't fit, how can anybody be enlightened, truth is afterall, so damn poorly lit...
<LI>I hope they hang him in the Civil trial !!!
<LI>I guess money can buy freedom 
<LI>Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
<LI>This  would have been a simple homicide case, if everyone hadn't been  playing  to the camera.  I believe the media played a much greater role in this case than they should have been allowed.
<LI>I wish that someone would do the same thing to OJ as he did but even worse.  I can't wait the day that he meets his "maker" and he sends hime straight to hell were he belongs!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Largely uninterested, but OJ is clearly guilty as sin
<LI>it was media circus
<LI>Hang in Chris. Try to get under allen's skin!
<LI>THE PROSECUTION WA "OUT LAWYERED - THE DEFENSE WERE ALOT SMARTER - PETERS PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO THE PROSECUTION  THEY [P] SURE DID BOTHCH THE CASE  I AM NOT A LAWYER BUT I FELT EMBARRASED FOR THEM THE PROSECUTION
<LI>This was a sad commentary on our society!!  The saddest part was the people who took a real interest in it--what a bunch of saps!!!!!!!!
<LI>OJ did kill them!  He's a psychotic liar! But with all the evidence left out, the jury was able to find "reasonable doubt".  :(
<LI>I believe that OJ should have been found guilty and sentenced to death row
<LI>I got sick and tired of hearing about it!
<LI>Hello Everybody!!!
<LI><font size=30>OJ KILLED EM ALL!!</font></FONT>
<LI>There was more than resonable doubt. Like Henry Lee said"something is awful wrong"
<LI>OJ Simpson is a two bit hood and a deserves to rot in hell.
<LI>The only thing that I can think of about the OJ Simpson's case  is that the prosection tried to nail OJ using scientific evidence. They did not have concrete proof  that he committed the crime alone and the LAPD  framed  OJ 
<LI>Time-line is all wrong for it to have been O.J. ,Ron would have fought harder if it had been one man should have gotten in some good punches enought to leave a mark or two.,I can't get over the feeling that if they would concentrate on Ron's stabwombs  they might wonder who he was tring  not to hit???
<LI>The media ruined all chance of a fair trial.  Justice was not served.  Evidence should not be dismissed based on technicalities
<LI>What a bunch of crap.  I hope they stick him in the civil trial.
<LI>LAPD  wasted a lot of precious time that could have been used to get the REAL  killers
<LI>Case lost when jury was picked. Nothing could have affected their thinking.
<LI>He got away with murder--Maybe he'll have to pay in the civil trial (I hope so)
<LI>There was a history of abuse by o.j. and is typical in mixed marrages.  They typically end in stalking and murder 
<LI>Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty - got away with double murder....
<LI>I think the community of Los Angeles was afraid of the outcome if the verdict would of been guilty.
<LI>OJ id it with help from AC, SHUN OJ
<LI>Personnally, I'm glad it's over.  I was getting freaking sick of hearing about it.  Now I get to look forward to ten years of the civil trial.  YAYYYYYYY!
<LI>I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL TRIAL.
<LI>I hope OJ shoots himself, but misses... and is permanently brain damaged.
<LI>It was a racial circus.  It was not about justice.
<LI>It was long and drawn out.
<LI>If you have enough money, you can get away with murder.
<LI>Mindless mush for the masses, typical of southern california, can't say I care a rat's ass about what happens(ed) to O.J or Nicole!!
<LI>I HOPE I'M WRONG BUT I WONDER WHO THIS SERIAL BUTCHER WILL KILL NEXT.
<LI>If he's not going to pay by serving prison time, having him pay financially will have to do.
<LI>Only the fucking $$$cash won again...
<LI>It was terrible and all a lie.  It was like watching the news of the 96 Election.
<LI>Too much attention has been paid to this event.
<LI>JUSTICE TRULY IS BLIND.  This trial has made us all see that.
<LI>If the gloves didn't fit, he killed her with tight gloves on.
<LI>OJ did it and will burn in hell for this crime!!  Fuck you OJ!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Simpson clearly murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.  If you have any doubt of this, read "Outrage" by Vincent Bugliosi.  It is shocking and disgraceful that an obvious murderer could have been acquitted, regardless of who that murderer is. 
<LI>Prosecution could not put OJ in the Bronco. ( P.s witness's..Kalin,Parks, & the guy walking his  dog at 10:30), all  said the Bronco was NOT on the street's or in the yard between  9:00 & 11:10 that nite. Robin Cotton said blood from Rockingham had from 2 to 50 times more DNA than blood (4 drops) from Bundy.  She said sunlight (UVL) does degrade DNA                                                                                                                                          
<LI>TO ME IT BECAME CLEAR THAT FAME, FORTUNE & RACE OVERRIDE JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY.  SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE JURY APPARENTLY DIDN'T FULLY COMPREHEND/UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS PRESENTED AND DIDN'T BOTHER TAKING THE TIME TO FIND OUT.
<LI>Prosecution could not
<LI>I think they should of hung the bastard.
<LI>Its time for America to move on.
<LI>American people should respect juries' decisions
<LI> What was "reasonable" to the jury was "obfuscation" to most
<LI>Race was never an issue to me.  I always hoped he didn't do it until I couldn't help but face the facts that he did do it.
<LI>OJ is a cold-blooded murderer
<LI>Everybody has an opinion on wether O.J. was guilty or not, but I don't think you can really say unless you sat through all the testimony.  This is why we have a "jury of our peers", rather then "Court T.V."
<LI>I think it's nice a rich black man can get the same justice as a rich white man.
<LI>Wake up!  O.J. did it, we have racist cops, a screwy legal system, and freedom that can be bought.  This country is still the greatest, but we *REALLY* have some issues!
<LI>Wake up people OJ Did it !!!!!!
<LI>the LAPD is so incompetant that couldn't frame an guilty man
<LI>It is a darn shame that just because your white people assume your against O.J.  This trial enables police to enter your property without a warrant.  The laws that were in place were there to keep the cops out of our lives without a good reason to be in them!  I am a law abiding citizen, and so was O.J.  What the police did was threw the law out the window then worried about it later.  How would you like to come home and find the police in your house because no one answered the door, so they assumed yo
 were hurt!!  Who's kidding who!
<LI>I hope OJ loses the civil trial but it's still not enough.
<LI>The trial never gave much focus on the the two little victims left motherless, They paid more attention to the Furhman issue.
<LI>It was an interesting teaching tool for my children -- we watched together, researched disagreements and learned a lot about the process of a criminal trial
<LI>O.J is GUILTY!!!!!!
<LI>It was a show not effort to seek truth and justice
<LI>Big joke
<LI>OJ is guilty and most of the people thinking he's innocent feel that he is innoncent because he is black, and as they all know, African-Americans are ALWAYS descriminated against by EVERYONE.
<LI>Too bad we can't convict someone on their actions.  He acted guilty...look at his jestures
<LI>I THINK THE WHOLE THING WAS VERY SAD FOR THE CHILDRENS SAKE
<LI>The Timeline tells it all--he did not have time to commit the murders and the police knew it and I also believe the police had an idea where they should be looking.
<LI>OJ DID IT!
<LI>As sad as it truly is, our justice system worked in the exact way it was designed to.  -- Dave MacKenzie 
<LI>As sad as it truly is, our justice system worked in the exact way it was designed to.  -- Dave MacKenzie 
<LI>Not only is justice blind but she is also ignorant
<LI>The first time your mate shows any signs of violence towards you GET OUT!
<LI>in my opinion the trial proved that in this country a man with enough money can get away with murder
<LI>It was a sad day for women. The verdict was a boost to spousal abuse. 
<LI>A travesty of justice
<LI>SURE IT WAS O J S BLOOD BUT WHO PLANTED IT. 1.5 CC BLOOD WAS MISSING (PIRATA) GOLDBERG DID NOT INVITE DEFENSE TO PIRATAS INTERVIEW
<LI>I THINK THE PROSECUTION BEHAVED OUTRAGEOUSLY AND HOPE THEY CAN LIVE WITH THEMSELVES.  THEY PROBABLY CAN THEY MADE ENOUGH MONEY
<LI>I believe that the main reason for O.J.'s verdict was the fact that the jury was uneducated.  Education is a main concern for this county.
<LI>the prosecution was not ready for trial
<LI>I hated Marcia Clark!!!   I wanted to see her lose her case!   She had way to much hate for OJ.
<LI>I was very disapointed in the verdict
<LI>The timeline testemony proves O.J.s aliby.
<LI>A liar should get the penalty intended for the accused.   (Deuteronomy 19:15-21)  Mark Fuhrman just got a $200 slap, and seems to be insulated thereby from further legal trouble.  Wonderful  how our authorities administer justice equally and fairly!  The crusades for "law and Order" too often degenerate into such circusses and "witch hunts".  Big city, or the "sticks"... LA or Wenatchee, WA, the eager rabble gets its show.
<LI>oj did it
<LI>This trial was a complete mockery of the American justice system. O.J. is an asshole!
<LI>The Jury's NOT GUITLY verdict was racially motivated. 
<LI>The LAPD screwed up the investigation from the beginning. THEY were convinced OJ was guilty and tried to make the evidence fit their case! I'm white and HAPPY OJ is free.
<LI>none
<LI>He was guilty before he was tried and even before all of the evidence was in.
<LI>Too many funny circumstances with the police investigation, therefore reasonable doubt
<LI>Equal justice under the law.  It's an ideal.  Should we try it somehow?
<LI>This case was horrible.  It shows that money can buy anything and everything.  Also, this was not the case of the century.  Anyone who says this is completely ignorant of the past 96 years.
<LI>In now TWO trials, the "majority media" seems to believe that "air tight" justice in a police state will solve society's problems and eliminate their fears.    The legal profe$$ion is "politically correctly" hijacking our basic American freedoms.  Fortunate for OJ he's been relieved of the apppeal process so far,  since many appeals are corrupt "rubber stamps" on cursory convictions of lower courts.  Rednecks and others could save their bullets for the real enemy,  Fuhrerman and his ilk.
<LI>There is something fishy when a detective can walk around a crime scene with a vial of blood taken from a possible suspect.  As to OJ's Bronco drive, it's hard to say what was in his mind, but with a black man's perspective, he may have expected  dirty treatment, and that seems to be borne out out by events since then.  It is also terrifying to me that a tiny piece of tissue, hair,  or whatever so easy to plant by bad-intentioned ones could be what convicts.
<LI>I am amazed at how much interest it garnered.  Most of the people I know who were giving it their undivided attention had little or no intrest in O.J.'s past or football career.  It was primarily grandstanding on the part of the Defense and the complete idiocy of Furhman and the LAPD (i.e. Rodney King) which landed the accquital.  What a poor reflection on the attitudes and intelligence of the American public this whole fiasco has been. 
<LI>This trial brought to painful public view the mindset which packs thousands of innocent into our prisons.  It's a huge waste of scarce resources and a multiple tragedy.  For innocent OR guilty, American "justice" is running on "overload".  Why?  They resort to too many "necessary" shortcuts?  Lawyers have created a profitable mess for themselves.
<LI>The Prosecution Team sucked.  Why wasn't Al Cowlings called? Where did OJ's luggage go?  Why were the blood samples carried back to the crime scene?
<LI>Tonight NBC gave a garbled/confusing update on public opinion regarding O.J.'s verdict.  Whites are swinging his way, and blacks are...?(3 Oct 96)  The prosecution would have been better off with strict adherence to constitution.  They lost my sympathy with the illegal search.  Do it right, then come to trial!
<LI>It's over everyone should go on with their lives
<LI>Anyone who thought that any or all of the black females on the jury would vote guilty in ANY trial  of a black man is not paying close attention to whats going on.
<LI>the trial was a mockery of justice. 
<LI>My hope is that Mr. Simpson's money will be given to others and he will have to  suffer the lose of face and prestige he deserves. I hope he becomes a pennyless nobody. 
<LI>A predominantly black jury will not convict a black person for murdering white people.  I predicted that there would be a hung jury because I knew that the black jurors would ignore the evidence but I did not not think that the whites on the jury would be so timid.  When the white male and one white woman were removed from the jury,  I knew that Simpson would walk.  May that jury rot in hell for this travesty of justice.
<LI>Ito and the prosecution did everything, no matter how sleazy to win. Thank God the jury was not fooled.
<LI>OJ is Guilty, period.
<LI>it was payback
<LI>oj needs to admit he did it and get on with his life.
<LI>The point at which history was truly made was the "white bronco" chase. Now media can pin ANYONE down ANYWHERE for the whole world to see if they so choose. We better hope its not us, because there will be nothing we can do about it. Think about it! ...OJ did it, by the way.
<LI>Waste of money
<LI>race will determine the outcome of the civil trial as well...
<LI>I believe this case is a fasimile of what occurs in court rooms all over the country.  The system is corrupt in many ways.  O J was tried and convicted constantly in the media.  This entire case is symbolic of people who feel the need to pass judgment without thinking calmly about facts.  Too many open questions for me before I could believe he committed these murders.  Police and prosecutors make up a seniro and then manufacture facts to support their fiction.  I pray to God we stop this folly and get
more mature in our system of the law.  
<LI>God will get OJ and those who lie in bed with him
<LI>Money can buy happiness!
<LI>What a bunch of bullshit...  He was guilty as hell and everyone knows it
<LI>This case should have taught us the meaning of " the law suppose, then the law be."  Cases still have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
<LI>It just goes to show you, money and fame are power.
<LI>His guilt is nearly as obvious as Dahmers..
<LI>He's guilty, it was a race thing.   That's a no-brainer.  I'm tired of African Americans defending him.  Are they proud of him?  That's a scarey thought!
<LI>I believe that if a man is found not guilty, that no one has the right to try to single-handly ruin a man because the feel that there "opinion" was disproved
<LI>I believe that if all citizens watch the full trial, they would have arrived at a non guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If they only watch the The Rivera show, they would have definitely convicted OJ because of the slanted news reporting.  Rivera is an attorney and knows that the  prosecution did not prove, beyound a reasonable doubt, that OJ was guilty yet he continued to report the happenings of the trial that the jury did not see, thereby causing the non-watching audience to believe that the jury w
s biased and freed OJ because of race.  I think that the jury did an outstanding job.  There was no need for a long deliberation.  There were so many areas that the prosecution did not prove that the jury had an array of non-answered questions that would have caused they to acquit OJ. I think that the criminal justice system review their method for permitting evidence.  Evidence should not be disallowed if submitted late.  The jury has the right to hear all the evidence.   
<LI>sad,very sad.
<LI>HE WILL PAY
<LI>it is sad what happen to nichole and ron, however the case did not prove that oj did the killing. the amount of blood that would have been found would not have been drops here and there it would have been massives of blood. i feel that people are letting their emotions judge instead of common sense.  i do believe oj known something but i do not believe he did the killing.  i also think the goldman's are just trying to get some money, they had not heard from their son in three years, that does not consi
ute a close relationship. get real people deal with facts not  emotions. no one person could have committed those murders. 
<LI>O.J. is guilty of spousal abuse and may know the true identity of the murderer(s), but he is not the one who perpetrated the crime.  There was reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
<LI>The trail shows if someone has enough money they can get away with murder
<LI>RON's Boss, the one with the ponytail hair do, murdered them
<LI>There was no integrity in the verdict. The juror's are just as guilty as OJ!
<LI>I believe O.J. probably did kill Nicole and Ron, probably with the help of someone else, but I agree with the verdict of Not Guilty because I do not believe the Prosecution proved O.J. guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  There was too much doubt raised by the Defense to find him Guilty.
<LI>too much TV coverage
<LI>With all the evidence and the Prosecutions lack of expertise Johnny Cochren did the impossible he got OJ off with a non-guilty verdict.
<LI>To bad there is double jeopardy and he can't be tried again not mater if he admits to it
<LI>We pay the Justice system to seek the whole truth, they did not. They got the verdict they earned... and they should not be paid....
<LI>GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>How can any unbiased person find Simpson not guilty?  I was hoping he was innocent but was convinced otherwise.
<LI>The whole thing was blown up into something it wasn't. There was NO WAY, with the publicity that it could really be a fair trial. People had their minds made up before they ever heard ONE WORD and STILL feel the same way regardless of a trial. There is no way, OJ Simpson will ever be free of this. The American public and the American media have thrown away our rights to a fair trial and to freedom from double jeopardy ( OJ Simpson is now on trial for the SAME CRIME in a civil court!!!) This is a traves
y of American "freedom"!
<LI>He probably did it but I am not certain enough to say Guilty. The people sueing him now should be SHOT, he was declared not guilty, leave him alone.
<LI>Doubt does not mean not guilty.
<LI>oj is the lowest form of life on this planet, except for cochran and bailey
<LI>I believe the whole thing was a travesty, yet I knew what the outcome would be. Regardless of what the jurors may say, it *was* all about racial conflicts.
<LI>This trial was a travesty, and has destroyed any faith I had in the "justice system".
<LI>O.J. SIMPSON IS AS GUILTY AS SIN!!!  The trial turned into an issue of race.  Everyone ganged up on Mark Fuhrman, and he hadn't even killed anyone!  In the end, it became the People vs. Mark Fuhrman, and oh, did someone say something about an . . O.J. Simpson?  Of course he got off.  What else would happen with a black majority jury for a famous black football player?
<LI>When is this search for the "REAL" killer going to start.  Oh, wait a minute, you see him everytime you look in the mirror, don't you OJ.
<LI>GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Americans need to seriously address the wide gulf between the races or there will soon be utter chaos in the United States.  Already in California, it would appear that juries are unable to arrive at rational verdicts because of all the extraneous racial factors that influence perceptions.
<LI>OJ is as guilty as hell, but from the evidence presented there was reasonable doubt--ITO is a joke
<LI>I hope the Brown's & Goldman's take him for every penny he has in the Civil case.
<LI>Justice is for sale (if you can afford it)
<LI>What a travesty of justice.  Glad I'm not an American.  The jury should hang its collective head in shame!!!
<LI>No one knows for sure what really happened.
<LI>What a farce !!!
<LI>So much for justice for the victims...
<LI>WHEN THE VERDICT CAME IN, I CRIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE WAS DEFINATELY GUILTY AND DESRVED TO PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE, JUST LIKE NICOLE BROWN AND RON GOLDMAN DID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>ALL TV COVERAGE OF TRIALS SHOULD BE BANNED!  The OJ trial was a total zoo!
<LI>Why was the bath water NOT tested for temp.? Where is that picture of the watch Nicole had on taken supposedly at the coroners? 
<LI>a murderer runs free as he trumphed justice by playing the race card
<LI>Had he not been able to afford those lawyers,  he would have never gotten away with it.  
<LI>O.J. may be free now but there will come a day when he will stand before God and answer this charge.  God is the ultimate judge and we will all stand before Him.  He will have the final say concerning us all.  O.J. might have gotten away in this life but our life on earth is just a moment compared to eternity in hell. Let us all be prepared for eternity for with God there is no sin worse than another.  We all need to repent of ours sins.  Otherwise we will be spending a long time with O.J.
<LI>Blown out waste of time
<LI>Oj's GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!
<LI>Who knows if he did it, it was possibley OJ!, but the evid was so poorly collected and presented, who can believe lying cops, incompetent criminalists and a prosec who embraces  who they know was a racist:mark fuhrman
<LI>I'm truly disappointed with the verdict and I was one that trusted the jury to do the right thing in the face of the overwhelming evidence.  Listening to their reasons, they are nothing more than ignorant fools.
<LI>Prosecution totally screwed this one up. They were too thorough. At least in their production of the prosecution. They  should have been, in hindsight, just brushing on his guilt, the bloodstaines, Fuhrman etc. They went into too much detail, giving the jury too many opportunities to poke a hole. Even at this late date, I am appalled at the decision, and am horrified at the future of our justice system and our Nation.
<LI>OJ has searched every golf course in America for the killer(s), where does he go next?
<LI>The entire exercise is more embarassing than educational. What does it say about American society that we view our legal system as a source of entertainment?
<LI>If Johnny Cochran knows in secret that OJ is guilty then Johnny ought to go to the chamber with OJ...no jail... 
<LI>disgusting
<LI>OJ Simpson is guilty. The whole trial was making a circus out of a tragedy in which 2 people DIED.
<LI>Money and the media buy freedom
<LI>It sucked, They should of never let the T.V in the court room!!!!
<LI>O.J. better always look over his shoulder!  A .308 cal, 168 gr match hollow point might find its mark.
<LI>OJ Simpson was guilty....definately....
<LI>JURY DID A GOOD JOB - THERE WAS REASONABLE DOUBT
<LI>I think O.J. did it, but the defense did their job, by creating "reasonable doubt" and the jury followed instrucions by not convicting him.  The justice system is screwed.
<LI>What still puzzles me,  1. no one actually tried to retrace the route..no one tried to time anything....how long it would take to get to Nicoles's ...how long it would take to commit the murders...where would he have parked? ..too much blood...yet what was found(outside the murder scene) was microscopic...where was all the blood????
<LI>Knowing what DNA is should be a prerequisite for serving on a jury
<LI>Maybe the civil trial will have a different outcome.
<LI>I think it was the biggest and most expencive joke there has ever been
<LI>It was a circus. In view of the actual pre-trial investigation, and the matter of bringing in past offenses, frankly, I'm glad that this trial ended as it did for the civil liberties of the rest of us. Consider being the presumably innocent defendant in a Grand Theft trial and every single on of your petty thefts as a minor were brought up. Or even a theft as an adult that allegedly happened years before and that you were never charged for. Prior investigation or even conviction, and connection, does n
t make a person the only suspect for a current crime. That was the precedent and case law I personally did not want set by the OJ Simpson trial. As an end note, if the investigation "had" found, beyond reasonable doubt that  he was the murderer and the invetigation had not been so botched, eg., mixing DNA samples at the crime scene, then I would have whole-heartedly agreed with a verdict of "Guilty"
<LI>I was surprised and very saddened by the verdict and the reaction in the African-American community.
<LI>Money talks.  Racism in our country spoke LOUDLY via this trial.  The black race must forgive the white race for past mistakes.  Unity is the key to peace.  To vote "Not Guilty" just because the man was black is prejudice in its ugliest form.  Evidence was conclusive.  The whole country is ashamed because we (blacks & whites alike) all knew the truth from the start.  It's hard to watch a hero turn into a monster.  Innocent men never run.  O.J. - what goes around comes around - I'm talking about the aft
r-life.  Do you think you can buy God off?  God bless the Browns & the Goldmans.
<LI>No matter what the verdict was, it would be a surprise.
<LI>I'm SO SICK of OJ.....
<LI>It was a travisty of justice, & the outcome made me ill
<LI>It simply reinforces the fact that "justice" has a different definition for the rich & famous than it does for the average American.
<LI>Based on the evidence that was presented in court, and that is what counts, I too would have found OJ not guilty.  The trial was a joke and the prosecution screwed up big time, as did the LAPD.  If it weren't their bungeling of the case, OJ would have probably been found guilty, as he probably is.  I don't think we can entirely blame our nation's justice system for letting OJ go free.  
<LI>The prosecution blew this case with over confidence in blood evidence which I believe in.
<LI>Think twice about avoiding jury duty.
<LI>Blacks saw this as a chance to get, "even with whitey" totally acquiting a man who slaughtered two innocent people!
<LI>It was the most disgusting display- black people sticking together and letting another one get away with murder. Civil Rights was always a pack of bullshit! I hope members of the jury's families get murdered and see how they like it!!
<LI>It was a disgrace and I wouldn't be surprised if OJ threatened them. He should die a horrible, painful death and rot in...well....you get the point.
<LI>This case only serves one purpose.  To prove that the u.s justice system, and those who participate in it are whores.  If one has enough $$$$$$$$ or fame then you will be set free. 
<LI>Shows how truly low the American public can get.
<LI>The fat lady has sung for America's legal system.
<LI>It was a total farce,  blacks on the jury seeing it as a way to "strike back" against whites; forgetting that they as women are being beaten and injured; and killed every day by abusive husbands.  The female jurors basically said it is okay to beat and even to kill your spouse.  Talk about slavery.
<LI>He did it alright.  Prosecution did not prove their case.
<LI>I NEVER want to hear about O.J AGAIN. 
<LI>I'm pissed that that murderer got off
<LI>Let it and everyone associated with it disappear forever. I'll have no more of it!
<LI>The Viet Nam War, Watergate, and the OJ verdict have done more to damage our country than any other other previous events in our history.
<LI>The jury was influenced by the LA riots
<LI>Anyone who thought the African American women on the jury were going to convict isn't paying close attention. They had to go HOME after the trial.
<LI>The LAPD was so incompetent that they couldn't frame a guilty man. The prosecution's case had a bad smell from the start.
<LI>I hope oj gets hung by his balls like the murderer he is!
<LI>The jury selection process must be changed so that the most ignorant people are excluded (just the opposite of this trial).
<LI>It's really sick that the black jurors could not see past the color of Simpson's skin.  This shameful trial has set back race relations for this Euro-american and makes me distrust blacks.  If Ron and Nicole had been black O.J. would have been convicted.  But maybe not as he is considered a so called sports "hero" and they are sacred in this crazy country.
<LI>Lessons evident:Ban Court TV ; Adopt English legal principle of Sub Judice -i.e. restrain trial by media ; the spectacle of third world quality rabble rousing enhanced by high tech facility demeaned the judicial process- in particular the complementary ou
<LI>Prosecution failed to make Furhman's racism overt but not germane 
<LI>L.A.police planted evidence
<LI>It's over already....leave him in peace to find "the real killer".
<LI>OJ Simpson probably did it and the misconduct of the LAPD justifies him going free.  They should clean up their act.
<LI>trial was too lenghty and a huge waste of time
<LI>Why do people make such a deal about it?  Also, I'm sure the jury had a reason for their verdict.
<LI>OJ is the guiltiest guy I have ever seen!
<LI>It was an outrage--the verdict I mean
<LI>justice is not blind, she cold in the ground lying next to Nicole
<LI>It was a disgrace OJ WAS guilty as sin!!
<LI>If he did not do it why did he run?
<LI>It was a travesty of our Justice system. He is guilty and should be punished, but the system was aborted by the jurys' failure to accept DNA evidence, I don't care why they didn't, they simply didn't.  Race should not be a factor in court, but, as it is in life, so it is in court.  Our criminal justice system and our society need help.
<LI>It is my deepest hope that blacks can learn to put aside racism as well as whites.  The test here was supposed to be about whether the man committed the crime, not about racism.  Yet we saw thousands of blacks rejoicing in the streets because OJ was acquitted.  If he wasn't guilty, why did he run (remember the Bronco chase)?
<LI>LAPD and the Coroner's Office lost this case for the prosecution. Even Fuhrman himself , years ago, admitted to growing racial animosity and instead of giving him a desk job or disability, they PROMOTED him. Fung/Mazzola are incompetent.Waiting 10 hours to call the coroner, 4 lead detectives leaving the crime scene, and missing blood added to the reasonable doubt. LA asked for this verdict...even though OJ is guilty.
<LI>He did it, he did it, he did it, murder.
<LI>OJ did it, 'Nuff said,
<LI>I think it was a total waste of taxpayers time and money.....
<LI>Simpson was not found innocent.  He was found not guilty with the evidence that was presented.  The man is not innocent.  He murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.  He is now bargaining for his children.  The Browns will be allowed to keep the kids provided they do not press on with the Civil Suit.  I would agree with them on this.  OJ does not, however, have any such bargaining chips with the Goldman family.  He will be ruined financially, and eventually, he will have to live in Europe.  He got away w
th murder because cops have been getting away with racist, disgusting, brutal policies for years.  If Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman were black, Simpson would have been found guilty.  He is guilty.  My heart breaks for his children.
<LI>OJ is a BEAST, he should go to hell.
<LI>OJ - Absolutely 100% NOT GUILTY!!!
<LI>The prosecution did not prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.  It was their obligation to do so and they failed.  Being found not guilty doesn't mean he didn't do it.  It means that it can't be proven.
<LI>A murderer golfs among us! :(
<LI>Rodney King cops were tried again, Simpson should be too
<LI>The whole thing was a cluster@#%*!
<LI>It's too bad race is such a factor for some people.
<LI>Somehow this stupid trial has become a martyr in our society.. Nothing about the trial merits any of the attention it recieved from the media or the impact it had on so many people.
<LI>Guilty.
<LI>This whole case has been a disgusting mockery of the system.  This case also brought our society back many years any progress made in race relations.  I should hope that we should learn from our mistakes.  O.J. Simpson: Guilty.  He'll serve a social payback now. Good luck tidying your image, O.J. 
<LI>It cost millions in court fees, and all that money was the biggest fucking waste, the trial gummed up a good portion of TV, preventing me from seeing some pretty good shows, also, OJ's hero status, and his reknown played a big factor in the outcome of the trial...
<LI>Money buys so-called justice
<LI>enough!!!!!
<LI>GET OVER IT!!  MOVE ON!!
<LI>The defense did good
<LI>He told her he would kill her and get away with it, and he did.
<LI>I THINK OJ SHOULD GET THE KIDS HIS THERE DAD
<LI>He's guilty, and we all know it.  He's a crimminal, and the Jury is blind if they can't see his guilt.  The only reason O.J. is free, is becuse like Robert Shipiro said "[the defense] played the race card from the bottom of the deck."  Race had virtually nothing to do with this case, and absolutely nothing to do with the murders.
<LI>The very rich can buy their chosen verdict.
<LI>oj sucks dick
<LI>the best thing I have ever watched 
<LI>I think everybody should be entitled to the defense OJ got. The police should be truthful in their investigation.
<LI>It was a sad day fot the victims familys
<LI>OJ Simpson was a victim just like The Beloved Nicole Brown Sipmson and Ron Goldman, OJ was a great target, but he had a better shield than others had for ammuntion. If you think there was not a resonable doubt, than you have closed your eyes. And if you think that nothing pointed at OJ, you also closed your eyes. It was a trial of all trials. The outcome was right, no matter what anyone says. If our Legal system works when people get put behind bars for rape, child molestation, and robbery, I don't thi
k that it broke just for OJ. He is free and he is now innocent. Leave the man alone and let him live his free life, like we all wish to.
<LI>Glad its over.
<LI>I think the only form of justice would be if Ron Goldman's dad would blow OJ's head off, and then be acquitted.  And the Brown family needs to feel like shit for not helping Nicole in the first place.
<LI>the verdict is so unfair! everyone knows o.j. did it1
<LI>Since an American jury found him innocent, we must abide by that decision. Right or wrong, this is the system we all follow. Eventually truth wills out, and the guilty party will live with that information all his/her life. What I find interesting is that if Nicole hadn't been murdered, no one, her family included would be doing anything to prevent her rich husband from beating her. Guilt is a powerful emotion. 
<LI>Oh what money can do!!!!
<LI>The jury were morons
<LI>Money/influence buys freedom. always had always will
<LI>The media made race a factor not anyone involved in the trial except for maybe Johnny Cochrane
<LI>It sucked but i love kato
<LI>I think the police truly believed O.J. Simpson committed the crime, because of his past of spousal abuse, so they planted the evidence to make a strong case.  It was ridiculous for the prosecution to have video taped the nurse's statement which was not done under oath.  The nurse's performance was so bad !  Most of all, I do not think O.J. would have jeopardized everything to have committed the murders.  With his money, he could have easily paid someone to do it.  Most of all, THERE WAS NO MOTIVE.  Bot
 of them were living their lives separately to the best of their ability.  Considering, Nicole, was a divorced woman, she was certainly well provided for by O.J. Simpson.  I also was married to an abusive man, but when I left my marriage, I walked out with the clothes on my back, and had to pay my lawyers dearly to get divorced.  I believe Nicole could have got mixed up with some unsavoury character and, of course, Ron Goldman was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<LI>The most unbelievable miscarriage of justice in history
<LI>The jury was biased. The one of the _VERY_ few times Rush limbaugh was wrong :(
<LI>The media hype and rumors and theories regarding the case should not affect the process that ensures every citizen's rights.  Gut feeling should not take the place of due process.  Those in the business of upholding the law, the cops, judges, lawyers are 
<LI>Only a higher authority knows the truth about O.J.
<LI>I believe the jury voted "not guilty" because they were afraid that a "guilty" verdict would generate another riot.  Also, I believe that O.J. did it, but not alone.  And as far as the leather glove not fitting on his hand??...  how the hell can you get a leather glove on over a rubber glove?  It's virtually impossible.  That was such a crock of shit as far as the defense goes.  If the jurers were so moronic to take that piece of so-called "evidence" into consideration, it only proves that there should
have been 12 different jurers hearing the trial.  Honestly, the whole think pissed me off.  Now, I'm not a promoter of this book, but if you want to read an enlightening book, read "Outrage:  5 Reasons O.J. Got Away With Murder" by Vincent Bugliousi
<LI>It was the media fascinated by their own power more than anything else, and America fascinated by the dark side of human beings.
<LI>Kill the bastard.
<LI>Showed how far the jury system has strayed from reality.
<LI>that bastard should be dead
<LI>OJ SHOULD BE REPAYED FOR THE TIME HE SPENT IN JAIL AND ALSO THE POLICE FORCE SHOULD CONTINUE INVESTIGATING ON FINGING THE REAL MURDER.
<LI>The nigger should have hung for it!!!!!!
<LI>I believe O.J. Simpson is guilty. The trial was an education in the American Justice System. What a joke!!!!
<LI>Jury verdict was a Rodney King LAPD payback
<LI>WHAT A FARCE!
<LI>verdict sucks
<LI>OJ got away with murder because of 1 sleazeball on the LAPD!!!
<LI>It just showed that the judicial system really doesn't try to find the truth anymore.
<LI>It was a complete farce.  Not guilty unless proven *beyond a reasonable doubt*!  Bad behavior on both sides contributed reasonable doubt. Lawyers suck.
<LI>what a joke
<LI>Way too much media attention; let's get on with our lives. I only participated in this survey to express this opinion!
<LI>A sad miscarriage of justice
<LI>It totally sucked!! It must be nice being a celebrity!!
<LI>oj is scum and a liar.  He did murder Ron and Nicole!!
<LI>I can't believe the uneducated opinions some people have! 
<LI>I am so sick of OJ that I can't even drink it for breakfast anymore
<LI>BORING BORING BORING!ENOUGH ALREADY!
<LI>COME ON O.J DID IT
<LI>It was a joke.  Believe it or not, blacks kill, too.
<LI>I'm sick of it. Make it go away, mommy.
<LI>The LAPD did a lousy job of investigating the murders; the detectives in charged violated OJ's 4th Amendment rights, then lied to the judge in the probable cause hearing; too many in the media and the public fell for the razzle-dazzle of the alleged DNA evidence; the LA County DA should never had moved to prosecute on the basis of the evidence presented, plus knowing that Furhman was a liar; and the public's knowledge about the US Constitution is sadly lacking: In this country, an accused does not have
to prove his innocence, he is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The great injustice here is that a person acquitted by a jury of his peers can then be sued in civil court for damages for something for which he has been acquitted in criminal court.  So much for the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.
<LI>no trial, you need a jury!
<LI>There was plenty of evidence to prove O.J. guilty!!!
<LI>I hope we never see the likes of it again!
<LI>I think having OJ try on the gloves over his latex gloves pretty much described the overall stupidity that abounded in that case. Hey, some things made even Kato seem bright. Maybe MArsha and Chris were concentrating on each other too much to realize how to prosecute the case. Then again, the jurors were about the dumbest things within 50 miles of the courtroom.
<LI>The trial shows that if you have the money you can pay to create doubts in a jury's thinking.  In this manner you can sway the jury to vote in your favor.  One more example of a separate system of jurispurdence (I do not say "justice" here) for the wealthy another for the avareage income person and the poor.
<LI>OJ is innocent, he DID not do it.  Police planted the "evidence", and a few of the cops should be hauled up in front of a judge to explain!  M. Clark should have known beforehand that she would not be successful and they should *NOT have wasted the taxpayers money.  
<LI>If Simpson were seated in my restaurant, I'd walk out.
<LI>O.J. is guilty as sin and how can somebody elses blood magically get changed into O.J.s blood by contamination?
<LI>O. J. DID IT!  Duh.  The jury was VERY obtuse and ignorant!  I wonder what what going through their heads . . .
<LI>It is my siincere hope that everything OJ tries to do is a failure. That way he will be in a virtual prison, where he belongs!
<LI>It was a travesty of our legal system.  Money and fame will get anyone off.
<LI>O.J. went into court innocent. The Jury's job was to listen to the evidence and determine if the Prosecution could prove the contrary. The Prosecution failed. Wether or not each individual believes he is guilty, Justice as defined in the USA was administe
<LI>To interject jury-nullification in order to send a race message is pathetic! Justice was NOT served.
<LI>This trial was a joke but I watched every second of it.
<LI>OJ SHOULD FRY
<LI>We have forgotten that once the jury says not guilty it is not guilty and not up for public retrial.  It's scarey what the American Public is like.
<LI>IN THE END VIGILANTE JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL
<LI>He'll get his ... some day, some way.
<LI>Judge Ito allowed too much in, prolonging the trial
<LI>THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A JOKE. LAYWERS ARE A DISGRACE
<LI>Ultimately, he will pay for what he did. The trail was a farce.
<LI>The jurors came to the right decision.  Read "LEGACY OF DECEPTION"   A real eye opener.
<LI>What the children have to live with is horrendus
<LI>The media did not portray the responsibility of the legal system adequately.  OJ is not legally required to prove his innocence!
<LI>Had Nicole been black and OJ white I would have believed that he was guilty and should have been convicted of first degree murder and either put away for the rest of his life or executed. The racists in our society wait to see the color of a face before they decide. I have no more respect for a black racist than I do for a white racist. Until our society has as much contempt for one as they do for the other our society will continue to head straight for the garbage bin. 
<LI>ANYONE WHO THINKS O.J. IS INNOCENT NEEDS TO HAVE A BRAIN SCAN TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY ACTIVITY.
<LI>O.J. murdered the mother of his kids and left her in a pool of blood for his children to find.  Luckily they didn't.
<LI>I'm so glad it's over!
<LI>It was a circus, not justice.
<LI>Christopher Darden's new book, In Contempt, is excellent
<LI>I think that the primary reason the jury voted not guilty wae.  I think that he lied, twisted facts, played to the jury, and inflamed the racial issue.  I also think that Judge Ito played a large part in the verdict by allowing cameras in the courtroom, g
<LI>Give a intellegence test to a all black jury before proceeding.
<LI>did oj get his hat & glove back?
<LI>It is a travesty of the system that O.J. should be living a normal life now, getting the same fame as always when we know that he is sickeningly guilty.
<LI>O.J SIMPSON IS THE BIGGEST JOKE ON THIS PLANET. HE SHOULD BE ROTTING IN JAIL. THE ONLY CONSILATION IS THAT HE KNOWS THAT HE IS GUILTY AND HE HAS TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. ALL OF YOU O.J SUPPORTERS DERSERVE TO BE KICKED IN THE HEAD. WAKE 
<LI>After watching most of the trial on TV and listening to the rest on the radio, I am convinced there was a serious miscarriage of justice when O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering two innocent human beings.  Nobody deserves to die the way Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman died!  O.J. Simpson thinks he is god....
<LI>OJ is an asshole.
<LI>OJ is a discrace to the community that made him a ftbl hero.
<LI>it was a slap in the face of the american justice system.
<LI>The Prosecution claims they fought so hard because of the interests of "all the battered women" out there.  If they wanted to do something for "battered" women, how about channeling some of the $5+ million they squandered on lawyering into shelters?  There is *NO* evidence to support the idea that OJ did it - there is only suspicion:  "Well who else then?" is not evidence and is not grounds for even charging him, much less finding him guilty and comments like this demonstrate the ignorance of those who
utter them.  If OJ cut his finger in the Bronco as Clark suggested, then why no blood inside the glove?  Reached for his phone "after" - no evidence of that.  How is it even POSSIBLE for a man with a mangled finger to fly 1/2 way across the continent and *NOBODY* notices?  The fact of the matter is that THIS alone is evidence that he didn't do it.  If there is no hole in his finger, then the *ONLY* way to get the blood out of OJ was with a needle!!!  Clark should have realised this at the outset, but like 
OST lawyers, her (and the prosecution team's)  interest was to turn the situation into a game - "and see if they could win"  ...all at the taxpayer's expense of course!   Marcia, want to help abused women?  Donate the windfall $$$ from your book, etc. to a women's shelter.  BTW, I'm a white male and I'm *NOT* a football fan.  Never really heard of OJ before the trial.
<LI>Black Power
<LI>Demonstrates that 1) Police can not be trusted & 2) legal system does NOT work!!!
<LI>Guilty as sin.
<LI>I don't really know if OJ did it, but somehow reasonable doubt was raised about the judicial system. (PS:  it's spelled "perjury")
<LI>Since OJ Simpson didn't take the stand they should have used the interview with Vannatter and Lang when OJ first came back from Chicago...It was a nail in OJ's coffin..but no worry...Vengence is mine saith the Lord....
<LI>This seems to be a trial that will never be over... Bad Procicutiers
<LI>It's over--but if he didn't kill them, who did?
<LI>They Framed a Guilty Man
<LI>The defense attorney's tactics and the obvious refusal of the jury to consider all the evidence in this case was truly disheartening.  The antics by attorneys that was allowed by judge Ito fueled the fire until it ran out of control.  It's obvious that discipline and moral responsibility was left at the front door.
<LI>It is frightening to see the effect black against white racism can have on justice.
<LI>The verdict was an embarrassment to the judicial system!!
<LI>In my opinion, I think O.J. Did it.  But either way anyone lokks at it, there is a vicious murderer running free.
<LI>it was stupid
<LI>My past belief that whites are more often racist than blacks has been changed forever.
<LI>Circus
<LI>Why is everyone so surprised? Did no one know there is racism in America.  Grow up and quit posing for the camera.  At some point, we're all going to have to just live our lives.  In a thousand years, will it matter what color you are?
<LI>The L.A. Police Department has an international reputation for dishonesty which makes their testimony suspect. 
<LI>If OJ did it then he has to live with it for the rest of his life because he has to look at his kids knowing that he killed their mother.
<LI>The verdict was a joke.  OJ's guilty!  Juice The Juice!
<LI>you have to be a complete asshole to think he is innocent
<LI>A travesty of justice...
<LI>I don't know if OJ done it or not but, if he is guilty white people can feel how blacks feel about the system
<LI>It wasn't about justice. It was often presented like a sporting event, and the lawyers and the judge loved the spotlight so much that they forgot the serious matter at hand. I feel the most sympathy for Ronald Goldman's family. They were dignified throughout the trial. I think that people would have forgiven O.J. if he had admitted that he killed them in a jealous rage. People don't forgive lies and smuggness. O.J. is now being punished in the court of public opinion. 
<LI>Justice may be slow at times, but it does eventually get served .
<LI>Long-term implications haven't even begun to be examined.
<LI>I will never visit LA!
<LI>The poorest excuse for justice that I've ever know about.
<LI>Black folks go to jail everyday for crimes that didn't commit. O.J. gets off and all of a sudden, there's no justice. Wake up and smell the truth!
<LI>To the stupid jury members - Resoniable doubt means that you may not fully believe all evidence but convict upon existing creditable evidence. God there are stupid people in the world like the three female black jury members who appeared on some TV programs. They define stupidity.
<LI>I never realized Blacks were such racists.
<LI>People are murdered everyday; far too much was made about O.J.
<LI>The whole thing was pathetic. OJ is one sick puppy.
<LI>OJ will start his REAL trial after he dies. Poor guy.
<LI>OJ was acquitted, quit whining.
<LI>The trial was a circus and did not belong on television at all.  Judge Ito is a wimp and did not control the proceedings, and I believe he is possibly on the defense payroll.  He dismissed the only unbiased juror on heresay.
<LI>OJ is 100% GUILTY!
<LI>The trial permitted re-victimization of the victims and let a gulity man go free. He will answer to a higher authority!
<LI>The jury did not say that he didn't do it they said there was reasonable doubt.
<LI>I wouldn't have been so upset if it hadn't pre-empted the shows on TV
<LI>The jury selection process needs to be re-examined. 
<LI>OJ should die, I hope Marcia gets crabs, FLee Bailey should rot in federal prison, I hope Johnnie Cochrane gets crabs, and everyone else should get a swift kick in the ass and a blow to the head for the shitty job they did.
<LI>The only reason O.J. Simpson was found not guilty is because he had enough money to get some good lawyers.
<LI>they should put the whole thing to rest, leave it alone.
<LI>The nigger did it.
<LI>the trial was a joke he is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY  and thats that .............
<LI>I am disgusted with the after verdict jury bashing
<LI>oj is a fucking asshole psychopathic liar who cannot be a father! He thinks he is so great because he made money by beating up on people. He is just a big ape
<LI>Trials such as this will eventually lead to "professional jurors"
<LI>The evidence didn't add up.  Definately tampered with.  Ito should have excluded the evidence obtained from jumping over the wall at Rockingham, the Bronco, which had been tampered with, and the unexplainable glove.
<LI>good trial
<LI>A travesty
<LI>The jury acuited him because he was black and a black won't convict a black. Exspecially for killing a white.
<LI>It was a classic example of the double standard of justice--one for the rich and famous and one for John/Jane Q. Public.  O.J. would be in prison if he were "just another person."
<LI>Simpson was completely guilty. The trial was a mockery and had nothing to do with "justice". It was not based on evidence, rather played upon the emotions of a weak jury. I feel very sorry for the Brown family who had to endure this. In the end however O.J. will undoubtedly meet his maker and get exactly what he deserves. He cannot escape himself.
<LI>Based on the evidence, I agree with the verdict.
<LI>Ito made a mockery of the very system that he should uphold to the highest.. He took an oath to, "SERVE."  The only serving he did was Hollywood.  Shame on you Ito, you disgust me..If you had a daughter, maybe you would have her marry O.J.  You were so impressed with his celebrity maybe he'll get you an acting job like Kato!!
<LI>circus
<LI>O.J, then who killed them?
<LI>Injustice is no way to find justice
<LI>I think I'm the only white female in America that agreed with the verdict--there WAS reasonable doubt!
<LI>OJ has a bad karma bomb ready to go off.
<LI>It was an embarrassment to our nation
<LI>Read Darden's book!
<LI>With $$$$ you buy almost....everything-including freedom!!! It's realy ashame!! 
<LI>I think illiteracy played the biggest part in the verdict.  The jurors were not educated and couldn't think in a logical fashion.
<LI>OJ Simpson will get what he deserves real soon.  Look for him to be 
<LI>Chris Darden showed me there are honourable lawyers
<LI>OJ SIMPSON MAY HAVE BEEN FREED IN REGARDS TO SOCIETY AND THIS CASE; HOWEVER, HE WILL PAY FOR HIS CRIME I HAVE NO DOUBT!  HAD ALL OF THE EVIDENCE BEEN PRESENTED THAT SHOULD HAVE TO THE JURY, THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR A REASONABLE DOUBT WOULD PROBABLY BE ALTERED.  THE OUTCOME OF THIS CASE REALLY DISGUSTS ME!!!
<LI>It just goes to show that justice is not blind at least not color blind.
<LI>A Total Travesty.  
<LI>one more piece of america falls..the justice system
<LI>If you believe that a person can enter a huge mansion all bloody and dirty, get upstairs, shower, change clothes, dispose of evidence, and be seated outside in a limo within 4 minutes, than maybe he did it!  If you can ignore the fact that fibers from the carpet in the Bronco were found stuck to blodd on the glove at the crime scene go there without being tampered with, then maybe he did it!  Etc. etc. etc...  It's sinful the way people are reacting!  I don't care about him one way or the other, but it
was clear that the evidence had been tampered with...no way he could have been found guilty under the law!  The verdict wasn't based on race, the snotty middleclass white reaction is solely based on racist attitudes.  He was legally found "not guilty".  It is downright un-American they way the white public is treating him...like uncivilized barbarians.  I am a white middleclassed person. thank you vary much!!!
<LI>The jury had reasonable doubt due to the prosecution's mishandling of the case
<LI>Where did they find those jurors? It was the jury selection that was pivotal. They will use this case for years to come in Jury Selection 101.
<LI>I think it was a sad excuse for justice.
<LI>Fuhrman a racist? Absolutely.  Does that constitute REASONABLE doubt of OJ's guilt???  Absolutely NOT!!
<LI>I believe that O.J. hired a hit man to kill his ex-wife. I also believe that part of the contract was for O.J. to watch the murder. This was probably done so that he could not later "rat" on the murderer without implicating himself. It is possible that when Goldman showed up, O.J. panicked an either got too close to the murder scene and was splattered by blood or he assisted the murderer in some capacity. I have analysed O.J. 's transcript from "Burden of Proof" and his suicide note and it is evidence 
hat he was deceptive and has witheld evidence.  I also believe that O.J. confessed to the murder during the Burden of Proof interview when he stated "I had a woman killed...". This statement occured when he was on his way to the cemetary with Cowlling. As for the prosecution, I feel that they let themselves get drawn into an emotional and personal confrontation that took their focus away from the case. They behaved in a very unprofessional manner. 
<LI>It was the biggest farce I have ever seen. It was his money and fame that got him off. Nothing else
<LI>guilty
<LI>I believe the jury saw OJ as a stand-in for anonymous black men who may have been mistreated by the justice system throughout the ages -- I do not believe the case was decided on its own merits & that the defense played to the lowest common denominator on
<LI>If you weren't there to see it happen, then there is no way you can say for sure that he's guilty or innocent!
<LI>Television made it a circus.  Cochran did a disservice to African-Americans.  He did his job, yes, but the effect was to give the public the impression that African-Americans were more interested in vindication for past injustices than convicting a man who could not possibly have been more gulity.
<LI>Decision was made at time of jury empanelment
<LI>GROSS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE
<LI>What a shameful circus this whole thing turned out to be. We are all responsible in some part for this.
<LI>Cochran is spelled wrong, sorry.  Murders should not be set free at any cost.
<LI>I have one thing to say about the American justice system, it's no different from the rest of North America when it comes to justice.
<LI>I have one thing to say about the American justice system, it's no different from the rest of North America when it comes to justice.
<LI>A very sad day for the American Justice system
<LI>a black jury will not convict a prominant black
<LI>I think the entire trial was a farce. Marcia Clark did not have the right stuff to try this case (and I'm a woman!).  She missed a lot of crucial points and made the DNA evidence unnecessarily complex.
<LI>fascinating
<LI>Can we say media overplay...who the hell cared?!  Was it any of my business?!  I think not.  I would much rather have watched Sesame Street--I would ahve been more entertained and learned a lot more about living my own life and dealing with others if I had.
<LI>OJ IS GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think this trial proved to the people of America that if you have enough money, you can get away with anything including murder.
<LI>Get rid of Geraldo!!!!
<LI>What a crock!
<LI>OJ is as guilty as sin.  He's a wife-beating murderer.
<LI>The injustice served up for the Brown and Goldman families to swallow is sad and unfair.  I hope that a guilty verdict is rendered in the civil suit against Simpson.  Though, they will no doubt ever see retrobution in the form of cash, he will be OFFICIALLY pegged as the murderer I believe he is. Maybe that will give the victims families a sence of justice and closure.
<LI>It should have been tried in Brentwood. Oj's peers are there
<LI>it was such a circus.  The lawyers were only playing up to the television cameras.  The trial should never have been on television in the first place!
<LI>The whole thing was a joke!
<LI>During the trial, Darden said that the "N" word is one of the filthiest words in the English language, and it does not belong in a court. Following Darden's statement, Cochran replied: " I would like to make an apology to African-Americans across the country on his behalf." Apology my butt. He was really saying Darden was a traitor. Pretty soon he will be saying White Devil as the Japanese did in World War II. Darden should be a role model for anti-racism to children across the world. And about O.J. In
his new video, he explained Nicole's injuries he gave her. "Some of them are from her own clumsiness, and the others are from when I was defending myself from her violent temper. She was a very powerful woman." Oh sure, scrawny Nicole beating up muscular O.J., who weighs twice as much. He should be grateful to Satan for getting away with murder and keep his big mouth shut.
<LI>OJ and his lawyers are contemptible scum -- he is a lying murderer, they are totally sleazeballs.. This was a travesty of justice. The jury were cowardly lowlifes -- like OJ, totally devoid of conscience. Marcia Clark and Chris Darden are heroes -- conscientious public servants of great principle and integrity. This was a cut & dried case, with an embarassment of evidence for conviction. It never never should have been televised. The sad part is that the Brown and Goldman families are forever bereaved 
nd Nicole's children will have to live with this tragedy forever. Everlasting shame
<LI>I hope that OJ Simpson is forever haunted by the brutal images of the two people he butchered.
<LI>By allowing this tiral to be a"circus-of-stars"and by billing this trial as "the trial of the century", our own justice system did a disservice to Nicole and Ron.  All that was needed was the facts and just the facts surrounding the crime; if those facts were not strong enough to convict OJ then the jury had no alternative but to acquit.Let this be a lesson that law belongs  in the courtroom while entertainment belongs on the stage.
<LI>It's hard to second-guess the jury's verdict given the information which was kept from them.  Also the media provided the rest of us with so much analysis that it's hard to separate out all the facts in accordance with our legal guidelines.  However, given the statements some juror's made following the verdict, it appears that at least a few of the panelists (e.g., Moran) had made up their minds early on that Simpson was not-guilty.  As a result it is likely that any contradictory evidence went unheede
.  Allowing the TV in the courtroom is a mistake.  Yes, the public has a right to know, but not at the expense of serving justice.  If people were that interested in the trial they should have gone to LA to sit in the courtroom.  I think that jurors should be better protected so that they don't have fears about voting either way.  I also think that the ability to play to the jury by the lawyers and defendants should be eliminated by having the jury behind a one-way mirror so that they can see everyone else
-but others can't see them.  If Simpson didn't do it, he knows who did.
<LI>very frighting
<LI>Who gives a ----?!??!
<LI>Travesty of justice. 
<LI>I would like to see the Civil Case televised
<LI>Hey, why waste time re-hashing the trial? We should be looking for the "real killers"! !!
<LI>The lesson: if the LAPD does not clean up their own house, then guilty men will continue to go free because of the reasonable doubt created by the testimony of crooked cops.
<LI>The prosecution attempted to introduce two timelines, but the two cancelled each other out. In addition they never proved that O.J. either owed the gloves or the shoes.
<LI>There was too much pre-trial publicity, and too many opinions dominating the media.
<LI>It was the most boring thing my mother has ever been addicted to.
<LI>A joke.  He's guilty as Hell.
<LI>J.C. has led race relations set about 30 years back. I may not have been around then, but I know things were race issues from books. It looks like race relations will continue going backward, but in reverse. Pretty soon it will be the whites who have to give up seats on the bus. It was terrible blacks had to, but we couldn't prevent our ancestors from doing it. Now, we can at least not do it again, But we are on our way. I hope R.R.'s will advance to a more civilized state. 
<LI>Who Cares?  My butt cares!!
<LI>oj is an uncivilized ape who made all his money because lazy couch potatoes across America like to watch people beat up on each other. He is uneducated and is incapable of being any kind of father. He should pay his kids lots of money and STAY THE HELL OUT OF THEIR LIVES!
<LI>The system worked like it was supposed to, and people are upset about it.
<LI>OJ is guilty as SIN
<LI>This trial has changed my view of justice.  Too many of the 
<LI>If you have money or fame, you can buy anyone off...!
<LI>Enough is enough, let's get on with life.
<LI>Criminal trials have no place on television
<LI>It was a media circus and a joke on the justice system.  Money can buy justice.
<LI>Jury showed a new level of stupidity.
<LI>I have no idea why Ito was nieve to judge O.J.
<LI>the jury practiced nullification of justice, there should have been a hung jury, charges should be pressed against them for not following the directions
<LI>Major waste of time.
<LI>The jurors are a bunch of morons. Need I say more?
<LI>By allowing the media to participate judge Ito extended the trial by probably 3-4 months.  The defense did what they were paid to do , namely divert the trial from the real issues, confuse the jurors with extrenious details and drag the trial out till the
<LI>People get acquitted for killing Blacks every day without the entire criminal justice system being called into questions.
<LI>I felt the trial did not change anybody's mind, but if you began assuming his innocence the evidence as presented and gathered was not convincing as to his guilt.
<LI>I feel the trial was a joke. Also that a few of the Main players saw the operunity to try and further their carreers. (pesonaly I hope it fails)
<LI>the rich are above the law
<LI>This is.....beyond belief. You can now by your way out of justice.
<LI>all bad things must come to an end
<LI>It is a very sad day. Crime and money pay.
<LI>It interupted the NBA playoff's and pissed me off!!!!!
