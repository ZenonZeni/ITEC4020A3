<P>
Taxable fixed-income funds normally have more
than 75% of their assets in fixed-income issues like bonds, preferred
stocks and money market instruments. Most frequently, income funds
pay monthly dividends that may be taken in cash or reinvested
to buy additional shares. Anyone living on a fixed income is attracted
to income funds for two reasons:  (1) bonds are usually considered a
more conservative investment than equities and (2) the monthly income helps budgeting.

securities or other securities collateralized by or representing
an interest in mortgages.</LI>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Short-Term / Intermediate U.S. Government

agencies or fully in Government National Mortgage Association

applies only to the interest and principal  payments of an individual
bond and does not guarantee that the bond, and therefore the fund
itself, won't fluctuate in price.</LI>

<LI><B>High Current Income Funds</B>
