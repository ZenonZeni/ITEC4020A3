<H2>SPH161      Engineering Physics 1A </H2><P>
<PRE>
Credit Points:          7<P>
Duration:               First Semester.<P>
Methodology:            3L and 1T per week.  <P>
Prerequisites:          As per B.Sc entrance requirements.  <P>
Incompatible:           SPH101<P>
Assessment:             80% Final exam, 20% Continuous Assessment. <P>

Objectives:<P>
This is a general introductory course in the physics of 
mechanics, wave motion and thermal physics.  The course is 
designed to be sufficiently general to be suitable for 
students majoring in subjects other than physics.<P>
Description:<P>
This unit consists of the lecture material covered in SPH101.  
The lectures cover introductory kinematics, dynamics, 
Newton's Laws and conservation of momentum, gravitation, 
kinetic energy and work, conservative forces and potential 
energy, conservation of energy, rotational motion, angular 
momentum, moments of inertia, central forces, Kepler's Laws, 
heat and temperature, first and second laws of 
thermodynamics, kinetic theory of gases, elasticity, the wave 
equation, standing waves, mechanical waves, fluid flow and 
Bernoulli's equation. <P>

Handbook Entry:<P>
This unit consists of the lecture material covered in SPH101 
with the laboratory component omitted.<P>
