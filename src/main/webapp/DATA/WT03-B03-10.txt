Bankruptcy considered a last, but viable, resort

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 4

by Matthew Miller

China has abandoned its historic reluctance to let its most
unprofitable state-owned companies go bust, but economists are not
predicting a wave of bankruptcies in the immediate future.

A record number of bankruptcy petitions was filed this year and
Beijing recently issued provisional regulations on the dissolution
of state companies.

But experts said fundamental questions on resettlement of state
employees who once enjoyed cradle-to-grave welfare benefits, as
well as resolution of outstanding bank loans, continued to make
bankruptcy the choice of last resort.

The state would keep trying to save its state-owned enterprises
whenever and however it could, a Beijing-based economist said.

Li Shan, executive director of Goldman Sachs (Asia), agreed. "There
will not be massive bankruptcy," Li said. "There are issues of
social unrest [to consider] but more importantly effects on the
banking system need to be resolved."

During the first nine months of this year more than 3,400 companies
petitioned for termination and the number could rise to 5,000 by
year-end. That would be about the same number of companies that
have filed for bankruptcy in the 10 years since the National
People's Congress passed the first bankruptcy law in 1986.

Ministry of Finance provisional regulations on the settlement of
financial issues call for further merging and bankruptcy of China's
most indebted state enterprises. The regulations apply to 58 large
and medium-sized pilot cities selected by the State Council
(cabinet) earlier this year.

Most importantly, the regulations for the first time identify
concepts of senior and junior debt in Chinese bankruptcy
proceedings. Wages owed, social security payments and other welfare
provisions will take priority over repayment of debt. Workers'
housing, schools and hospitals cannot be liquidated to pay off
debts.

Giving the welfare and resettlement of workers priority has been
the practice in Chinese bankruptcy proceedings but there have been
no such regulations in the past.

Even if state planners could resolve problems of employee
resettlement, the massive debts of state companies make bankers
wary of any spate of bankruptcies.

Earlier this month the State Statistics Bureau revealed that in
1995 total debt in the state sector amounted to 3.36 trillion
renminbi (US$405 billion), outstripping total private bank deposits
of Rmb2.97 billion. The bureau reported the asset-liability ratio
for the 148,000 state enterprises at 85 percent.

Historically, debt owed to state banks is the last to be paid in
any bankruptcy proceeding. Moreover, local officials have never
shied away from bankrupting enterprises so the companies can avoid
repaying large creditors, typically state banks.

Even when state banks have been allowed to foreclose on factories
holding mortgage-backed loans, the results often have been
disastrous.

The Sichuan provincial city of Mianyang is one of the pilot
locations for the new bankruptcy regulations. When the city's
Miaoting Paper Mill declared bankruptcy in April 1995, the local
court ruled that an Rmb11.22 million mortgage-backed debt owed to
the local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) would be settled through foreclosure of the factory's walls,
roads, toilets and sewers.

The local courts also ordered five more factories bankrupt,
creating total losses for ICBC's Mianyang branch of Rmb70 million.
Total assets at the branch amounted to only Rmb110 million. Branch
general manager Li Yichun said it would take the bank 15 years to
write off the foreclosures.

State bankers pointed out that overvaluation of state assets also
made bankruptcy an unacceptable practice. Last week's unsuccessful
auction of land use rights at the bankrupt Shanghai No 4 Plastic
Products Factory is indicative of the problem.

The land auction, which would have been Shanghai's first for a
bankrupt enterprise, was organized to raise funds to relocate and
re-employ factory workers, as well as repay a company debt of
Rmb11.26 million, much of which is owed to ICBC's Shanghai branch.

But the Shanghai municipal land planning bureau attached a minimum
value to the real estate of Rmb2,600 per square meter, well above
the Rmb2,000 per square meter that developers were prepared to pay.
When bids for the minimum price failed to materialize, the auction
was canceled.

A spokesman for Shanghai Light Industry Holding, the parent company
of Shanghai No 4 Plastic Products Factory, said the failure would
certainly influence the future auction of property rights for other
bankrupt state companies.

Despite such setbacks, observers remain hopeful that recent
developments signal a new willingness to tackle the difficulties
facing the state sector.

"It's significant that they're speaking about the process," said
Goldman Sach's Li. "If the austerity program should continue it
will create conditions for deterioration of state-owned enterprise
performance. These new bankruptcy

provisions will give them an outlet to make better use of their
assets."

Membership to OECD gives Seoul host of labor headaches

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 3

by Elizabeth Pisani

Only a few days before South Korea is due to sign on the dotted
line for membership of the OECD, the club for rich nations,
international trade unionists are once again waving the flag of
workers' rights, demanding that labor law reforms promised by Seoul
be speeded up.

International activists tell tales of abuses in South Korean-owned
factories around the world. "Anti-unionism and worker exploitation
has become another Korean export," said a forthcoming article in
the trade union magazine Free Labour World.

Their voices form an unlikely chorus with those of the very
companies they criticize. South Korea's giant conglomerates, too,
want to see labor laws changed, but for very different reasons.
While trade unionists complain that present law makes it too hard
for workers to organize, employers complain laws make it too hard
to fire staff.

The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
(ICFTU) had been lobbying hard for labor laws to be changed before
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development formally
invited South Korea to join the body, which now groups 28 of the
world's leading economies.

Unionists feared that once the invitation was issued, as it was on
October 15, Seoul would have no incentive to change restrictive
labor laws. European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan recently
reminded South Korean legislators that OECD nations would continue
to press for labor reforms. But when Seoul finally signs an
agreement to join the largely Western group in Paris on Friday, the
impetus may well be lost.

"We have written again today to the labor minister to remind him of
the commitments he has made," an ICFTU official said on Monday. The
trade union grouping, working with two South Korean affiliates, is
concerned above all with a law which forbids unionists who do not
work in a given company to support or mediate in that company's
labor disputes.

Ironically, this law is something of a headache for employers, too.

While it does cut out the possibility of activists working across
a whole industry, the present system puffs up wage bills. Employers
find they are picking up the paychecks for dozens of workers who
spend all their time on union activities.

Unionists would like, too, to see workers permitted to join any one
of a range of labor organizations - at present the law limits
workers to one union per company. "Our third bone of contention is
the prohibition on public sector workers' union membership," the
ICFTU official said.

None of the international trade union body's demands go beyond
conventions promoted by the United Nations' International Labor
Organization (ILO) agency. As Asian governments fight to keep
workers rights off the agenda at world trade talks scheduled for
December in Singapore, they are touting the ILO as the proper forum
for labor issues.

Asian nations reason that elaborate social security systems that
protect workers are inappropriate to their level of development.
Labor activists counter that they are asking for the ILO minimum.
They have also said that the "developing economy" argument did not
hold water coming from South Korea, the OECD's second Asian member
after Japan. South Korea exported US$3 billion in investments in
1995 and half that amount again in only the first three months of
1996.

Every day the European media has stories of a new South Korean
triumph. Investment is promised in televisions, in semiconductors,
in cars. Even European aircraft are on the block to South Korean
bidders.

And yet, pointed out Free Labour World, papers around the world
were also heaving with reports of labor unrest at Korean-owned
factories. From Argentina to Vietnam, workers are reported to be
humiliated or mistreated by their South Korean bosses. "Korean
multinationals make very bad ambassadors in most countries," said
an article due to appear in the November issue of the magazine.

Its bad reputation notwithstanding, Korea appears keen to pass
skills on to others. Several groups, finding they have lost senior
staff in overseas companies after a takeover, have called for more
training of foreign managers in Korea. And Seoul has promised to
pump US$10 million into a job training center in Beijing.

Opening floodgates of goodwill

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Francesco Lao Xi Sisci

Sino-German relations are back on track after several months of
friction, according to both sides, and China has welcomed Bonn's
important backing for its Three Gorges dam project.

Four months after Beijing angrily canceled his original visit,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has been given a high-profile
reception in Beijing. The welcome did not cool even when Kinkel
raised the thorny issue of human rights.

"There had been bumps in Sino-German relations... but things are
now resolved," Kinkel said on Monday after meeting his Chinese
counterpart Qian Qichen. Qian also said relations were back to
normal.

China has welcomed plans for a visit by German President Roman
Herzog next month but was even more pleased by German support for
Three Gorges.

Bonn in recent weeks has agreed to guarantee German investment in
the project, the German side announced. It was a groundbreaking
result for China after the United States and Japan had refused to
do likewise and the World Bank withheld support. The dam across the
Yangtze River, brainchild of late chairman Mao Zedong, and
personally encouraged by Premier Li Peng, will cost US$30 billion.

Opponents fear it will cause serious environmental damage for
questionable benefits.

The Chinese believe the dam, which when completed would be the
world's largest, will end periodic floods along the Yangtze and
increase China's power capacity by 18,000 megawatts.

German support is politically and economically very important
following China's recent announcement of a US$1 billion bond issue
to finance the project.

The Chinese Financial Daily reported on Monday that 17 billion
renminbi (US$2 billion) had already been invested. On Tuesday the
Guangming Daily reported that Li Peng had visited the site and
spoke to people who will be forced to move.

A total of 1.07 million people must be relocated from the area to
be flooded. The dam will be completed in the year 2009.

Kinkel's July visit was postponed after the German parliament
passed a resolution on Tibet critical of Beijing.

Kinkel, who met Communist Party leader and State President Jiang
Zemin and Li Peng on Tuesday, raised the cases of dissidents Wei
Jingsheng and Wang Dan during his meeting with Qian on Monday.

Wang Dan, 27, a veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests, has been
charged with subversion and could receive a sentence ranging from
10 years to life.

Wei, sentenced in 1994 to a 14-year jail term for subversion, has
already spent nearly 15 years in prison.

Kinkel described his meeting with Qian, at which he raised the
plight of the dissidents, as very cordial.

Other foreign visitors who raised human rights issues, and
specifically individual cases, customarily received a frosty
response.

The German government has been accused by opposition parties in
Bonn of going soft on China over human rights for the sake of
lucrative contracts. Engineering giant Siemens is bidding to supply
generators to Three Gorges.

Kinkel said on Tuesday Germany was considering opening an
industrial park in the central city of Wuxi. He said China was keen
to use German technology in the fields of transport,
telecommunications and infrastructure.

"China and Germany complement each other in many ways, they ideally
dovetail," he said.

Germany is China's largest European trading partner and its fourth
largest global trading partner. Two-way trade last year was worth
DM21 billion (US$13.6 billion).

Police put their feet down on no-hands truck drivers

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Shu-Ching Jean Chen

Police are about to get tough with Taiwan's notorious truckers - by
ordering them not to steer with their feet.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications will soon
announce a rule making it compulsory for drivers to keep their
hands constantly on the wheel.

"Our policemen have seen truck drivers relying on their feet to
steer at speeds of 70 or 80km per hour," said an official at the
Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau. "That has greatly increased
the risks of driving on the highway.

"Some were even spotted eating from lunch boxes or playing with
their mobile phones while letting go of the wheel."

Such maverick driving often occurs at night, when traffic is light
or drivers are tired after long hours on the road, or in traffic
jams.

But without a new rule police have no legal power to crack down.
The rule will clearly specify that steering with one's feet or
taking both hands off the wheel is an offense.

Offenders will face a fine of NT$3,000 (US$109) to NT$6,000.

Enforcing the rule may, however, prove difficult. "Even the camera
might not be able to catch a clear picture of what's going on
inside a truck," said Lin Wein-hsien, secretary-general of the
Truck Cargo Transportation Association. "The police will have
technical problems in coming up with solid evidence."

But Lin said the passage of the rule could in itself serve as a
warning to delinquent drivers.

Truckers are currently among the most dangerous drivers on Taiwan's
crowded highways. According to the Taiwan Area National Freeway
Bureau, trucks and other large cargo vehicles made up only 22
percent of the traffic flow on highways in 1995 but accounted for
31 percent of accidents.

The figure is alarming but still a distinct improvement on 1994
when trucks accounted for 44 percent of accidents.

Taiwan truckers are also notorious for forcing other vehicles out
of their way by flashing their headlights immediately behind them.

Thailand pins down airwave bandits

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Jaruwan Ngamman

In Bangkok's bustling Mahboonkrong shopping center, if you want to
make an international phone call the price charged is usually a
steal - literally. Illegal cellular phone operators there let you
call using "stolen numbers" and the final bill winds up in the
hands of some unsuspecting subscriber.

After five years of rapid growth Thailand's cellular phone
companies, who claim to provide first world technology in a
developing economy, are now confronting what once used to be a
first world problem - air time theft.

Worried by the way it is wreaking havoc on customers' bills and
siphoning away millions of baht in revenue each year, two of the
country's biggest cellular phone operators, Advanced Info Service
(AIS) and Total Access Communication (TAC), are teaming up to curb
the illegal business.

The companies, which until recently held a duopoly over the
country's lucrative cellular phone market, have launched a campaign
aimed at alerting customers and warning off air time thieves.

Last week Thai police arrested three illegal mobile phone operators
who allegedly coordinated their business with employees of AIS.

"We are determined to send illegal air time operators to jail,"
said AIS vice-president Vuthiporn Chaipayom.

AIS plans to spend more than 200 million baht (US$7.8 million) to
install the Subscriber Identity Security system at its 29 telecom
base stations by year end. The SIS International Gateway Office, an
international air time theft agency based in the Netherlands, will
monitor the system for an annual fee of 12 million baht.

The key to preventing air time theft, said industry executives, was
to safeguard the passwords encrypted in signals emanating from
mobile phones which enable access to the telecom network for making
domestic and international calls.

One way in which thieves - usually cellular phone repair shop
owners - get their hands on the passwords is through handling
handsets given to them for maintenance.

Industry executives also blame the problem on those subscribers who
employ repair shops to tune inexpensive handsets for other family
members who want to use the same mobile phone number. In the
process, they unwittingly give the repair shop access to their
passwords.

Passwords can also be deciphered through the use of special
devices, such as those manufactured by one California-based
company, which intercepts and decodes signals between cellular
phones and base stations.

Each "stolen number" is usually used for only a couple of months
before the original subscribers get wise to the fact that their
bills are being inflated by illicit calls.

The price charged for such pirated cellular phones is often as low
as 10,000 baht, whereas normal subscribers pay twice as much for
the handset, a one-time registration fee of 4,000 baht and a
monthly subscription fee of 500 baht.

"We will need the cooperation of our customers in preventing air
time theft," said TAC vice-president Somyot Woraprechapanich. TAC
executives said the company had set up shop at Mahboonkrong to keep
an eye on illegal phone operators in coordination with the police.

According to Somyot, the company has already spent more than 100
million baht on the installation of a new security system for its
network. TAC also has plans to impose a ceiling on the amount of
international calls next year, after consultations with its
clients.

The crackdown stems in part from the prospect of growing
competition in the sector, which makes maximizing revenues a
priority for cellular operators.

In July this year, a legal advisory body did away with the
monopolies granted to AIS and TAC by state-owned telecom companies
in 1990.

Another theory is that the present campaign is part of the
companies' efforts to push sales of their digital mobile phone
services, said to be less prone to air time theft than analog
systems.

Both companies, after starting out with cellular phones using
analog systems five years ago, have in recent years invested
heavily in digital telecom networks and are finding it difficult to
attract new subscribers, due to a number of reasons including their
higher cost.

It's extortion, claims News Corp

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Yaroslav Trofimov

Rupert Murdoch, probably the most powerful man in the global media
business, would be ill-advised to come to Israel. If he does,
Israeli tax authorities warn, he will be certainly "invited for
questioning" and maybe even arrested.

According to accusations put forward by Israel's Income Tax
Authority (ITA), Murdoch's main concern in the Jewish state, News
Datacom Research, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sydney-based News
Corp, has "swindled" Israel's Treasury out of tens of millions of
dollars.

In what is being described by the Israeli media as "the biggest tax
fraud in Israeli history", the ITA claims that News Datacom did not
report as much as US$150 million of income between 1989 and 1996.
The company's executives, accountants and attorneys have already
been interrogated by ITA investigators.

Murdoch has vehemently denied the accusations, blaming disgruntled
former employees for instigating the scandal.

"The company has filed all required tax returns and paid all
applicable taxes... statements to the media appear to be a result
of a continued extortion campaign by former employees who have been
sued in the United Kingdom by News Datacom for defrauding it of
millions of dollars," News Datacom said.

The company employs 250 people at its research laboratory in
Jerusalem and manufacturing facility in Haifa. It produces the
so-called "smart cards" used by Murdoch-owned satellite ventures
such as Hong Kong-based StarTV and London-based British Sky
Broadcasting, which ensure that only paid-up subscribers can access
the encrypted programming.

The technology for the cards is based on an invention by Israeli
mathematician Adi Shamir, who until recently served as a News
Datacom director. Shamir has already been questioned by the ITA.
News Datacom allegedly reported only a fraction of payments
received for the technology and software that it developed in
Israel and "smuggled" abroad.

The bulk of the income it had earned was allegedly paid to
Murdoch-owned companies in Hong Kong, where the tax rate is much
lower.

Daewoo scoffs at white knight talk

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Claude Albert and Philip Golub, Asia Times

The chairman of South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Tuesday
dismissed reports of a counter-offer for France's Thomson
Multimedia as a "joke", but sought to mollify French critics of the
deal with his firm.

"We have been working very seriously on the bid for the past six
months and I don't see any new global offer being presented at this
late stage," Bae Soon-hoon told a news conference.

Thomson Multimedia is the consumer electronics arm of Thomson,
which is due to be privatized by the end of the year. The French
government announced last week it had selected an offer from
France's Lagardere and Daewoo for Thomson over a competing bid by
Alcatel Alsthom.

Daewoo Electronics is to take over 85 percent or more of Thomson
Multimedia, a world leader in digital technologies and the world's
fourth largest television maker. The partnership will create the
world's largest television producer.

The French business press suggested this week that a rival French
bidder for Thomson Multimedia was about to be found. The Liberation
daily on Tuesday said Sagem, which fell out of the race earlier,
was preparing such a bid. Sagem denied any bid and Bae dismissed
the idea.

Daewoo's purchase has provoked intense criticism from an array of
business interests, trade unions and political parties, all of whom
denounced the sell off of one of France's leading high-tech
companies to a foreign group.

Discord spread within the government, with senior officials close
to National Assembly President Philippe Seguin voicing strong
opposition to the deal.

"The government failed for years to recapitalize Thomson
Multimedia, forcing the company to pay exorbitant interest on its
outstanding debt," said Elie Cohen of the French National Center
for Scientific Research, one of the more articulate critics of the
sale.

As a result, said Cohen, it is being sold just when it is heading
towards profitability. "France would not sell Thomson Multimedia to
a foreign company at this time if it still had an industrial
ambition of its own," he said.

The critics are unlikely to deter the French government from its
chosen course. La Tribune on Tuesday quoted sources close to the
finance minister as saying that even if the government received a
new bid it could not consider it since Thomson as a whole and not
any particular part was being privatized.

Asked about one of the more contentious issues of the takeover -
the amount of debt which Daewoo will assume - Bae said "we are not
allowed to make it public". Out of a total debt of FF14 billion
(US$2.69 billion), Daewoo Electronics is thought to have agreed to
pay FF4.8 billion. But, when asked whether his group would be
willing or able to take on the total debt, Bae said: "I think so,
yes."

Bae reiterated that Daewoo Electronics would stick to its
commitment to create 5,000 jobs at Thomson Multimedia in five
years. He said the firm's independence would be maintained by
keeping its headquarters in Paris.

The statement is unlikely to mollify critics who have expressed
concern that Daewoo could radically revamp the management
structure.

Bae did not allay this concern but did say that most of the top
management would remain French, adding: "It is hard to imagine that
Koreans would come to live in Paris though they love to visit it as
tourists."

Though it is unlikely to upset the deal, the political pressure has
already pushed Lagardere and Daewoo to alter some prior agreements.
Last week Jean-Luc Lagardere said the two groups would create a
common subsidiary for next-generation consumer electronic products,
rather than simply ceding Thomson Multimedia's high-tech digital
activities to Daewoo.

French interests will thus retain a say in the more sensitive
high-tech sectors.

Hyundai defends plant in Poland

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Andrea Thalemann, Asia TImes

The Polish government is expected to announce on Wednesday whether
South Korea's largest chaebol, Hyundai, had illegally established
a car assembly plant in Poland only days before a new decree on
import duty waivers took effect.

The Polish Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Cooperation have questioned the legality of an official
licence which permitted Hyundai and its Polish partner Universal in
August to import car parts without paying 35 percent import duty.
The licence was issued by the Ministry for Foreign Economic
Cooperation and then suspended after a sudden change in import
regulations for car parts.

Hyundai and Universal said they were victims of intentionally
untransparent government regulations.

Last July, the companies agreed to assemble 15,000 models in the
first year, taking into account Polish law which grants companies
that assemble more than 1,000 cars a year in Poland, duty-free
imports of parts.

The two companies received official permission for their venture on
August 8, when Universal heard of an imminent change to the
existing regulations whereby duty waivers would be granted only to
car manufacturers already in operation.

That sent the infant venture scrambling for proof of its existence.
In a matter of days, Hyundai brought in assembly kits and a Korean
technician to an unused factory north of Warsaw. By August 24, they
had assembled the first batch of cars.

Two days later, the new regulation was published in the Legal
Gazette. It required every foreign car maker to apply for new
import permits effective on August 24 - the day Hyundai had
invoiced its first cars.

There was, however, no official announcement before or on the day
the decree went into effect.

Hyundai said without a duty waiver, its cars would be effectively
priced out of the Polish car market.

Copper trader faces long, slow procedure

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Richard Hanson

Yasuo Hamanaka, the 48-year-old former Sumitomo Corp copper trader
at the heart of one of history's most spectacular financial losses,
was sent through the gates of the cream-colored Tokyo Detention
House on Tuesday, a journey made by some of Japan's most famous
politicians and criminals.

Prosecutors arrested the mild-mannered Hamanaka, after criminal
charges were filed by his former employer alleging that he had,
over the past three years, forged hundreds of order forms and other
documents to cover up huge losses while he was in charge of
Sumitomo's multibillion dollar global copper trading operations.

Breach of trust charges are being prepared.

In June, Hamanaka was fired when the company revealed copper trade
losses of US$1.8 billion. Last month, Sumitomo said the loss was as
large as US$2.6 billion.

In size, the loss eclipses that of Baring's US$1.3 billion stock
index futures debacle in Singapore two years ago, and Daiwa Bank's
US$1.1 billion New York bond trading loss in September 1995.

In all three cases, the seemingly loyal, profit-making employee was
given freedom to operate with loose management controls and each
one had hidden his losses for extended periods from both management
and the regulatory authorities.

Sumitomo said Hamanaka's first losses in copper trading occurred
about 10 years ago on the London Metal Exchange. He had extensive
dealings with companies in the United States and was able to borrow
large amounts of funds from many of the top banks in the world,
based on the supposed backing of the giant Sumitomo trading house.

At the height of his fame, Hamanaka was dubbed within the market as
Mr Copper or Mr Five Percent - the share of the world copper market
that Sumitomo controlled at one time.

It was said that he accounted for half of the copper trades on the
London Metal Exchange at one point.

The Sumitomo copper scandal has prompted what is now described as
close cooperation among criminal-justice authorities in Britain,
the US and Japan.

In the US, where Sumitomo has closed its metals trading business,
six lawsuits have been filed against the trading house by
customers. A lawyer in Tokyo is preparing to file a suit on behalf
of a group of Japanese shareholders against Sumitomo's management.

Hamanaka has the distinction of being the first and, so far, the
only person to be charged in the copper scandal by the Tokyo
Prosecutors Office.

The office raided his house in a suburb of Tokyo on early Tuesday
morning. Neither Sumitomo nor the prosecutors disclosed exactly
where Hamanaka was arrested, although he was seen being taken by
car into the Tokyo Detention House at around 3.30pm.

The wheels of criminal justice grind slowly and deliberately in
Japan, as prosecutors build their case. Initially, suspects can be
detained for questioning in the sparsely-furnished cells of the
detention house for up to a month, and even longer if further
charges are filed.

The late former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka was so detained over
two decades, and later convicted, in the famous Lockheed aircraft
bribery scandal of the mid-1970s. A more recent example was Shoko
Asahara, leader of the now-disbanded Aum Supreme Truth religious
group, who is on trial for masterminding a deadly 1995 poison gas
attack on the Tokyo subway system.

Hamanaka's alleged crimes involved no claims of personal gain, and
were certainly not heinous, but they were still surrounded by
riddles over who else might have been involved and the role of
Sumitomo's own management.

At a news conference on Tuesday, a Sumitomo executive would not
comment on either the names of the clients that Hamanaka had traded
with outside of Japan, or even the names of the countries in which
they lived.

Sakuo Nanba, general manager of Sumitomo's legal department, was
also reported to have said that the company's internal
investigation so far had not found evidence that Hamanaka was
manipulating the world copper market - a key point in the
investigation.

Hamanaka's alleged forgery involved two types of documents, which
were drawn up in the hundreds over the past three years while
trying to conceal losses from management. One used falsified
signatures of two senior Sumitomo officials between January and
March 1994 to place orders with customers. Another used in
September that year said Hamanaka had sole authority over the use
of funds obtained overseas.

The details over how Hamanaka managed to run up US$2.6 billion in
losses have not been disclosed. The scam was only unraveled earlier
this year when Hamanaka was about to be promoted and posted to
Indonesia.

Caught in a minefield

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 11

by Karen Back, for Asia Times

Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett used to plant land mines as a
soldier. Now he makes a living destroying them. An expert in mine
detection and destruction, he has worked for the past several years
as a consultant to defense contractors. He has also helped United
Nations forces carry out peace-keeping operations in Mozambi que
and Bosnia where he's helmed "nonmilitary operations to
rehabilitate countries" - clearing land mines, restoring power
lines and reopening roads.

"After a war is over, the mines are still in the ground and don't
care who the enemy is," said Barrett. "They detonate whenever
somebody stands on them or runs over them with a vehicle. There's
no limitation on who they maim."

If you step on a land mine, what should you do? "Once you step on
them, they go bang. You're going to lose part of a limb," he said.
"The Western mines don't do as much damage as the old Soviet-bloc
mines. The Western anti-personnel mines have far less explosives in
them - they will quite often take a foot off only up to your ankle.
But with a Soviet anti-personnel mine, you'll quite often lose your
leg below the knee." He has seen colleagues die after stepping on
mines because "you can't get medical aid to them quick enough. They
lose blood too quickly to be saved."

Barrett works on contracts for companies such as Science
Applications International Corporation. A mine clearance job could
run from three weeks to three years. His longest stint so far was
two-and-a-half years in Mozambique, where he and his crew de-mined
approximately 4,000km of road. Mine clearance is not cheap. A
project can cost from US$2 million to US$50 million. A typical
2,000km of road costs from US$5 million to US$10 million to clear,
takes from four to six months and utilizes four mine-protected
vehicles. The mine-clearing contingent of 50 people live in either
tents or caravans using mobile showers, eating cooked breakfasts,
cold lunch and a barbecued dinner. Nightly recreation on-site
includes Rambo-type videos and books. Barrett likes to read authors
John Clancy and Darryl Brown.

The mine detection system he uses, Checkmate, is unique, he said,
because it only looked for the explosive vapor which every mine
has. Other systems use metal detection and ground-penetrating
radar. Samples of air are taken either manually or by
remote-controlled miniature aircraft, about the size of model
planes, which fly over suspected mine fields. The air vapor, a kind
of a fingerprint, is captured on to an absorbent compound in a
small tube which is presented to a trained dog kept in a sterile
environment who determines from the scent whether there's evidence
of a mine there. If the dog makes a positive ID, a specific area is
searched.

Born in Rhodesia, Barrett, who moved to southern California in the
United States in 1994, learned his trade "purely by accident". He
said: "In Africa we had a land mine war engaged by the guerrillas,
freedom fighters, whatever you want to call them, over the past
25-odd years, so we developed a lot of techniques to protect
vehicles transporting soldiers. After taking an advanced
demolitions course, I started to learn about mines."

Explosives training was a requirement for Special Forces troops in
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Barrett commanded a Special Forces
regiment, leading counter-terrorist/ counter-insurgency oper
ations. "We killed guerrillas, terrorists outside our country," he
said. He twice received Rhodesia's Legion of Merit for combating
terrorism. At the conclusion of the war in Rhodesia and "after
consultation with Robert Mugabe, the new leader of Zimbabwe",
Barrett and his contingent of the Special Air Service immigrated en
masse to South Africa and were inducted into the South African
defense forces in 1980.

He led that unit for a year, retired from the military in 1981 and
began working in "bomb inhibition", eventually running Suppression
Technology Systems in Johannesburg, South Africa. Described by a
colleague as a "steely-eyed man with a hair-trigger temper", for
the past several years he has also specialized in explosive
detection and land mine clearance.

"If there are anti-personnel mines, we tramp them out using a 10
tonne mine-protected armored vehicle which has a long bomb arm with
a special steel wheel with disc rollers on it which digs the mine
out of the ground," said Barrett. "We just drive over the mines,
which explodes them."

Driving over an exploding land mine sounds dangerous. "It's just a
cloud of dust," said Barrett. "You just carry on driving." It
doesn't inflict damage on the vehicle because it can withstand 30
pounds of explosives, and the mine only has a couple of ounces of
explosives in it. Does he feel like Rambo driving over a mine in a
10 tonne tank? "It's not fun," said Barrett. "Too much dirt and
dust coming in."

Barrett also told a story about men collecting mines in Kuwait. "As
they extracted the mines, the men kept throwing them in their
truck. They threw one too many in there and detonated the whole
truck. About 19 men were killed. But I've been very lucky. I've had
friends blown up behind me and in front of me. But I've never hit
one myself."

Sometimes he puts mines in a holding place until he decides how to
deal with them. "You don't want to blow a mine next to a road
otherwise you'll cause even more damage," he said. "Often, you'll
move it out of a vulnerable place, put it somewhere nearby and
possibly burn it up using thermit. But you have to be careful you
don't start a fire because thermit burns extremely hot." If there
are anti-tank mines that aren't blast-protected, they blow up.
"Modern mines have blast protection built into them which means a
time-pressure impulse is required on the mine's detonation system,"
he explained. "That doesn't exist on an older mine, so you put a
light plastic bag inflated with special gas over it which then
sends a blast of pressure into the mine and detonates it. With
blast-protected mines, you've got to put an explosive charge
directly over the mine and blow it."

There are two different kinds of mines: Anti-personnel and
anti-vehicle. Each has 20 different derivatives. The mines causing
most of the world's problems today are anti-personnel mines,
according to Barrett. "When undergrowth regrows it makes it
extremely difficult to get to them and deal with them," he said.
"The biggest problem with anti-personnel mines is because they were
indiscriminately laid on unmarked mine fields. They were designed
to affect the population as well as the forces that were fighting."

Barrett doesn't wear any protective gear when doing land mine
clearance - just khakis and a button-down shirt - and doesn't
consider himself a risk-taker. "I'm a bit adventurous is about
all," he said. As a colonel in both the Rhodesian and South African
armies, Barrett always regarded mines "as a double-edged sword...
In Rhodesia, we were forced to put up a cordon sanitaire [a
screened off area] which included mines. We used mines sparingly
elsewhere but we did use them against our enemy [the guerrilla
army]." Does Barrett feel differently about mines today? "Land
mines will always be a double-edged sword," he said. "They're as
bad for the user as they are for the enemy they're supposed to
deter."

The US government has led the way in trying to get modern mines to
have mechanical or electronic means of being deactivated, or to
destroy themselves after a limited period of time to prevent this
debacle in the future. A large portion of NATO has joined a
moratorium on the sale and export of mines, but it is not worldwide
yet. Indeed, the US has not agreed to completely cease mine use,
citing its involvement on the Korean peninsula.

Over the past 20 years land mines have killed more civilians than
military personnel, and at one point in Cambodia they were killing
600 people a month.

The high toll mines take on civilians was one of the reasons
Barrett moved into mine clearance. "It was an area I knew
intimately and it gave me enormous satisfaction to be able to try
to remove a serious menace. To be able to help civilian populations
was something I thought should be done. I believe sincerely that
unless countries, and they're mainly in the Third World, rid
themselves of mines, they will never get off financial aid. The
wealthy countries in the world cannot continue feeding them
financial aid and it's an essential element for those countries to
get back on their feet, get their own economy, their own
agriculture re-established. Without clearing mines, you're not
going to do that."

Unless he steps on a land mine himself, Barrett will not be out of
a job any time soon. The US State Department estimates that there
are 85 million mines in the ground in 68 countries and that nearly
3,000 people are killed by unexploded land mines each year.

While he enjoys cleaning mines, what he really likes, he said, is
"playing golf".

Isn't golf a little tame compared to the rest of his life? "You're
playing against yourself, so it's not tame," he said. "And you've
got to control your own temper and frustration." He laughed.
"That's why golf is so good. It teaches you to do that."

US, Taiwan take stock of the future

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Gene Koprowski

The United States and Taiwan may be nearing a futures market war as
officials in both countries approach a point-of-no-return in a
long-running dispute.

Taiwanese stock market officials have rejected an offer from the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that would have ended the growing
controversy over the CME's proposed futures contract based on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) index.

Accordingly, trading of the instrument may commence "before the end
of the year", executives at the CME said in a document obtained by
Asia Times.

Industry insiders said Taiex and Taiwan's Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) would prefer to pass a futures regulation law for
the country, and have their own futures market up and running,
before they started working with the CME - the world's largest
financial futures exchange.

The rejection of the offer to share market data and delay the
launch of the contract came in a letter from Taiex dated October 11
and delivered to CME chairman Jack Sander and president Bill
Brodsky only last week.

Shau-Dai Lin, who heads Taiex, expressed "continued concerns" about
the CME's plans to begin offering the futures, fearing they would
increase the volatility of the Taipei market, the sixth largest
stock market in the world. Taiex also sent the letter about CME to
the US futures regulatory authority, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC), headed by Brooksley Born. CME officials said
they expected a similar letter to be delivered by the Taiwan SEC
very shortly.

The letter followed a visit in late September by Daung-Yen Lu,
chairman of the Taiwan SEC, H W Chien, chairman of the Taipei
Securities Dealers Association, and officials from Taiex who flew
to Chicago to ask the CME to postpone the launch of the futures
contract for a year.

Sander and Brodsky tried to address the concerns one week later in
a memorandum to all the parties, which indicated that futures would
not increase volatility on the Taipei market. Sander and Brodsky
also said that they were quite willing to delay the launch of the
contract until the middle of January 1997 - not until next October,
as the Taiwanese wished - but only if Taipei would share data on
trends in the market on demand with CME.

"The only written response we've gotten is from the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, and it doesn't look like they're going to cooperate with
an information-sharing agreement," said Ellen Resnick, a
spokeswoman for the Chicago bourse.

"They expressed continued concerns. They did say that they
recognized the importance of an information-sharing agreement, but
it was worded in such a way that it did not seem like it was
something they wanted to do. We expect to receive a letter from the
[Taiwan] SEC as well. That's where things stand," she said.

Sander and Brodsky last Friday sent a reply to the Taiwanese
indicating that if the proposal to share information was not
accepted by the government, the CME would launch the contract as
early as the end of the year.

"If our latest proposal is not accepted by the Taiwan SEC, we are
prepared to launch these contracts upon approval of US
authorities," Sander and Brodsky wrote in a letter dated October
18, obtained by Asia Times. "As far as the CME's application for
the contracts is concerned, the CFTC public comment period ended on
October 10. The comment letters were overwhelmingly in favor of the
CME's application. We expect the US authorities to make a decision
regarding our application within the next two months."

Late last week, another bourse in the US, the Pacific Stock
Exchange (PSE) - a regional market in San Francisco - announced
that it too was considering launching its own options, based on the
Taiex, with or without Taiwanese partners, officials said.

"When we launched the Mexican Stock Exchange index, we launched
futures and the Chicago Board of Trade launched options. The
Pacific Stock Exchange deal is similar in that way. We see this as
a positive thing," Resnick said. "They did talk to us ahead of
time."

The futures and options contract would be derived from the Dow
Jones Taiwan Stock Index, a capitalization weighted, broad-based
index of 113 Taiwanese stocks, representing more than 80 percent of
Taiwan's market capitalization.

Last year, Taiwan traded 267 billion shares and handled more trades
than the New York Stock Exchange.

CME officials earlier this month held a meeting in Taipei with 300
futures and securities industry representatives who indicated they
were interested in working with the Chicago bourse.

The PSE had also been courting Taiwanese securities industry
representatives, and the PSE "plans to work closely" with Taiex
officials, Robert Greber, chairman and chief executive officer of
the PSE, said. "By trading options on the index now, we'll generate
additional interest and credibility for the Taiwan market," Greber
said. "We'll also offer the Taiwanese financial community the
opportunity to gain invaluable experience before the market opens."

Themes from the heart

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 10

by Priya Tuli, for Asia Times

Take a balmy Jakarta evening, the haunting strains of the sitar,
air fragrance mingling with incense and you have October 10 - the
opening night of an exhibition of paintings by Parvathi Nayar
Narayan at the Koi Gallery. Titled The Art of a Woman, this was the
Indian-born artist's debut show in Jakarta since moving to
Indonesia a year ago.

Represented at the exhibition were three distinctly different
styles, providing an insight into the varied scope and range of
Parvathi's work. The majority contained her experimental trademark
in mixed media - an exuberance of color and technique. These large
expanses of expressive form and color are executed in ink, dye and
acrylic, and employ a combination of techniques - pouring and
texturing to produce visual images that are complex and
multilayered.

Most of these depict Rajasthani women from northwest India. They
walk tall and stand proud; their beauty transcends mere features
and form, and is evident in every step and every gesture. These are
women who brave the fierce desert heat and walk kilometers each day
to the nearest water source. These are women who raise children and
work just as hard as their menfolk. And these are women who dance
with abandon at festival time in a spontaneous celebration of life.

In a defiant response to the brazen desert sun and the drab desert
sands, the clothes they wear are vibrant and blazing yellows,
brilliant reds, dazzling greens and deep blues - sheer inspiration
for an artist. "The colors I've used are vivid, but never primary.
You'll notice they have greater depth and variation than primaries.
That's because I never use a color in its pure form. These are
colors I'm comfortable with right now."

Part of the same group in terms of technique, the series titled
Woman and her Emotions focuses on one dominant color to establish
and enhance the depth of each emotion.

"It's true that color has emotional connections. Woman in Pain just
had to be in blue. I didn't even think about it, it just came so
spontaneously. Amusement is in green - a young, frivolous, bright
green. If I had done one on jealousy, it would have been green too,
but a darker, heavier green.

Lust had to be earthy brown, with hints of yellow and blue... You
know, this series was completed in one continuous, intensely
creative spurt that lasted around three or four months. I didn't
feel that I had come to the end of the series then. But for now, I
do. I might get back to it at a later stage. The strange thing is
that everybody thought they'd be slow to sell, but six of the seven
have gone already. That just tells me to go on painting from the
heart."

The next series contained black-and-white, pen-and-ink drawings,
where the faces of the women are left blank. This is an interesting
device that draws upon the viewer to interpret the women's
personalities subjectively. The last style on view was the more
academic use of oils. One painting was, Noon Watch, in which a
little girl rocks the makeshift crib where her younger sibling
sleeps - a common sight in India.

As an artist who rejoices in exploring and experimenting,
Parvathi's involvement with technique and texture is amply evident
in the content of this exhibition. As she pointed out: "I spend
more time looking at a painting than actually doing it. I look for
the rhythms, identify what I need to pull out and develop - what I
need to suppress. I guess that's where the skill counts, in
deciding.

"The effects I get are sometimes planned, sometimes accidental. But
I use the accidents as part of the process, so that carefully
planned areas combine with the unplanned." That, in a nutshell, is
really what art is all about to Parvathi, a celebration of "being,
exploring and becoming". Well traveled, she has lived and painted
in India, London and Singapore. But while her addresses might
change, Parvathi's distinctive styles simply evolve as this
exhibition clearly demonstrates.

The Art of a Woman exhibition at the the Koi Gallery in Jakarta
runs until November 4, 1996.

In Japan, if you build it they will vote for you

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9

by Bradley Martin

There is one message Japan's voters sent loud and clear in Sunday's
election: "Rev up the concrete mixers!"

The pork barrel is the heart and soul of the politics that the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Sunday's big winner, practises in
election districts across the land.

Critics may complain the result is the rapid despoliation of what
was once a lovely countryside, as politicians and bureaucrats
devise ever more useless projects with which they can return to
local communities some of the taxpayers' money filtered, of course,
through construction companies, their suppliers and employees.

Or foreign environmentalists may ad-vise that the concrete
embankments being installed on once-scenic riverbanks, for example,
will only have to be removed as the predictably dire effects of
this destruction of nature become evident. Do voters care? App-
arently not. With depressing ease, they are swayed to ignore the
wider public interest and cast their ballots for the force they see
as most likely to keep the public works pipeline full. That usually
is the LDP.

Take Shimane prefecture's first district. More than three decades
ago, the Agriculture Ministry began planning a massive project to
fill in big parts of a large, beautiful lagoon, called Nakaumi,
adjoining the Japan Sea coast. The reason: To provide additional
farmland for the crowded country.

It was not long before the government, to deal with excess rice
production, started paying farmers to stop farming existing
farmland. At that point, naturally the project was dropped, right?
Wrong. The Nakaumi project has proved to have a life of its own.
The prefectural governor ardently supports its continuation, and so
does Hiroyuki Hosoda, a politician who ran on the LDP ticket to
represent the district in the Lower House.

The national and Shimane prefecture governments each year split the
cost of some yen220 billion (US$1.96 billion) worth of public works
projects. That makes the pork barrel a very major element in the
local economy. A construction company owner told Asahi Shimbun
before the election he expected a 40 percent loss in earnings if a
non-LDP government should come to power. Hosoda faced nominees of
the newly-formed Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Both
opposed the Nakaumi project, making it the big local issue in the
race. But all the votes cast for those two other candidates put
together did not equal the tally for the LDP man, who was handily
elected.

The people spoke on Nakaumi, and what they said was: "Fill it in."

To some extent this represents official and popular trust in the
Keynesian notion that a "supplementary budget" of public works
funds - such as the proposed yen5 trillion package the LDP
announced just before election day - can prime the pump and bring
the economy out of a slump. But some economists say this remedy has
proved less effective, to the point where any resulting positive
bounce in the economy is over almost as soon as it has begun.

The ill effects live on - notably an ever larger budget deficit for
succeeding generations to shoulder. Deregulation and cutting
budgets and taxes to leave more money in the hands of consumers
would have far more positive effects.

There are plenty more districts like Shimane's first district,
where the LDP's construction mania carried the day with voters on
Sunday. For example, construction companies squarely backed the
LDP's candidate in Saitama prefecture's 10th, a mixed
bedroom-suburban and rural district that was the focus of an Asia
Times front-page article last Friday. The LDP man squashed the
candidate of the newly-formed Democratic Party.

In Toyama prefecture, the emcee at Tamisuke Watanuki's victory
celebration, before leading three cheers of "Banzai" (long life),
enthused that the victory of the former LDP secretary-general meant
the central government would now give serious thought to building
the Hokuriku bullet train line. The area's pet scheme would be a
dreadfully expensive project whose costs, under the current
share-the-misery policy, would force an increase in fares on
profitable bullet-train routes like Tokyo-Osaka.

Construction's domination of politics could be seen in the raw in
Ibaraki prefecture, where former construction minister Kishiro
Nakamura, awaiting a court ruling on a suspected yen10 million
bribe to put the quietus on a Fair Trade Commission investigation
of construction industry collusion, was re-elected. Nakamura had
formally left the LDP after the allegation came to light, and was
running as an independent. He told voters he had accepted the money
but it had been merely a campaign contribution. He boasted his
presence in office provided an important conduit from the central
government to the district.

At first glance, Kumamoto prefecture's second district may appear
to be an exception to the general rule. There, a loudly
pro-construction LDP candidate - a former Construction Ministry
bureaucrat who vowed to snare central government funds for such
expensive projects as a bullet-train line - went down to defeat at
the hands of a candidate who had attacked that traditional sort of
pork-barrel campaigning. So, were the Kumamoto voters finally
wising up? Guess again. The winning candidate himself had served a
stint as construction minister. And in his brochure, where he
attacked the pork barrel, he also included photos of a bridge, a
train station and other public works projects he took credit for
having landed.

All the parties in the election were talking about "administrative
reform" and about cutting the bureaucracy down to size. Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashi-moto, president of the LDP, even told voters
he knew his place in history would be determined by his success or
failure in carrying out such reforms.

But don't bet the farm that an LDP-led coalition government will
seriously disrupt the comfortable partnership of bureaucrats with
the construction companies and the LDP lawmakers of the
"construction tribe", who protect the ministries' public works
programs in exchange for political funds and get-out-the-vote
backing.

US public responds to Clinton-Riady scandal with a yawn

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9

by Doug Tsuruoka

With two weeks to go before the United States presidential
election, conservative critics are hoping that a disclosure of
financial donations made to the White House by a prominent
Indonesian family and South Korean business interests will throw a
last-minute glitch into US President Bill Clinton's re-election
campaign.

Yet one puzzling question in the wake of a decision by the
Democratic National Committee (DNC) to suspend a top Asian-American
aide pending a probe of his fund-raising activities with Asian
businessmen is why the issue, so far, has generated only mild
public attention in the 1996 US presidential race. In past
campaigns, the taint of "foreign money" would have been enough to
derail the aspirations of any candidate for the Oval Office.

Many recall the press fallout on then-president Jimmy Carter when
it was divulged in the late 1970s that his brother, Billy, had
close ties with Libyan diplomats and businessmen. But despite the
best efforts of leading US newspapers like the New York Times and
the Los Angeles Times, the Riady scandal is drawing only muted
outrage from a bored US electorate.

The DNC, the national organization of the Democratic Party which is
backing Clinton's re-election bid, announced last week that John
Huang, a vice-chairman of its fund-raising arm, will step aside
following reports that he sought an illegal US$250,000 political
contribution for the Clinton campaign from a South Korean
industrial conglomerate. The contribution - from the South Korean
electronics company, Cheong Am - was returned after it was
uncovered by a local newspaper.

Huang, a former employee of the Riadys and a Democratic fund-raiser
in the key electoral state of California, is also under the
spotlight for his ties to the Riadys - a family of Indonesian
industrialists who control the Lippo Group of companies and who
made a series of apparently legal campaign contributions to Clinton
during his 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns. Huang is also said
to have secured a top appointment to the US Commerce Department
because of his relationship with the Riadys and US Democrats.

The donations by the Riadys and suggestions of favoritism by the
White House emerged against the backdrop of Clinton's efforts to
arrange a billion-dollar sale of US F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia,
a red-carpet reception for Indonesia's President Suharto in
Washington last year and reports the Riadys once tried to enter the
banking industry in Clinton's home state of Arkansas.

But US voters are so apathetic to the issue of foreign money in
this year's election that not one of the "typical" Americans
selected to question Clinton and his Republican opponent Robert
Dole at a presidential debate in California on October 16 bothered
to bring it up.

Participants were so indifferent, in fact, that Dole, frustrated at
the lack of focus on foreign policy matters at the debate last
week, was forced to volunteer a pointed reference to "rich people"
in Indonesia and other foreign countries in a jibe at Clinton's
campaign ethics - though the question posed had nothing to do with
the Riadys or their alleged influence at the White House.

Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to open a
Congressional inquiry into the affair - which is laced with reports
that James Riady, a scion of the Indonesian family, used his
financing clout with the Democrats to arrange a special audience
with Clinton while the president was attending a meeting of top
Southeast Asian leaders in Jakarta in late 1995.

But most Democratic and Republican analysts in Washington have
already concluded the scandal will not do irreparable harm to
Clinton's re-election bid. White House aides, moreover, appear to
have parried the bad publicity by insisting that all contributions
from the Riadys were "legal".

How to explain this absence of interest on the part of the US
electorate? There are three factors which appear to have
contributed to the scandal's non-effect on Clinton.

The first is simply that the flap over the Riadys pales before a
host of other scandals which have hit the White House over the last
four years.

With the president and First Lady Hillary Clinton still under
scrutiny in the so-called Whitewater banking and influence scandal
and its possible link to the still-mysterious suicide of a White
House counsel - the Indonesian-South Korean donations are hardly
the stuff which tabloid headlines are made of.

The Riady affair hardly compares in entertainment value to the
confessions of alleged Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers in the
1992 presidential race and this year's far juicier reports that top
Clinton tactician Dick Morris, the architect of the president's
"family values" campaign pitch, allowed a call girl to listen from
a hotel room to his telephone conversations with the president.

A second factor is the Riady affair is not the first time big Asian
money has been involved in a Washington influence-peddling scheme.

Interestingly, the Riadys appear to have offended far fewer
Americans in the economic growth-obsessed US of the 1990s than was
the case nearly 20 years ago.

In January 1978, a Washington-based South Korean lobbyist, Park
Tong-sun, admitted in Seoul that he had dispensed US$850,000 to a
number of US Congressmen in an affair laced with allegations of
sexual favors which came to be known as the Koreagate scandal.

Former California congressman Rich-ard T Hanna was sentenced to a
prison term for his role in the scandal, while five other house
Democrats were reprimanded in the influence-peddling scheme which
was intended to tilt US politicians in favor of Seoul following an
abrupt US pullout from South Vietnam.

The Koreagate affair stirred anti-foreign sentiment in the US at a
time when the media was rife with reports of Saudi Arabian
businessmen buying up US properties.

But a change seems to have taken place in the US mentality in the
last two decades. A seemingly endless eruption of successor
scandals to the famed Watergate scandal of the early 1970s has
imbued most US voters with a sense of cynical worldliness.

Coupled with the globalization of the US economy since the 1980s
and a renewed search for overseas profits following the recent US
recession, news that a US president cultivated allies and received
legal donations from a Southeast Asian country where the US is
seeking to sell high-tech fighter planes, leaves most Americans
yawning. The Riady affair just does not sound so bad at a time when
the fate of many US firms depends on markets like China and the US
Commerce Department scours the globe searching for contracts for US
companies.

The third factor tempering US political reaction to the Riady
scandal is the rising clout of the Asian-American community.

Whereas two decades ago, Asian-Americans were still viewed as an
invisible minority in US elections, this is no longer the case.
Surging birth rates, disposable incomes, voter registration levels
and improved political organization have made Asian-Americans a
force to be reckoned with on the US political scene - as
illustrated by Huang's elevation to the key Democratic fund-raising
post.

Dole and other Republican critics of the Riady affair have also
meticulously avoided alluding to the scandal in ethnic terms
fearful of alienating potent Asian-American constituencies in
California - a state which Dole must wrest from Clinton if he is to
have any chance of winning the White House in November.

Said Kim Young-kun, a professor of political science at the
Graduate School of the City University of New York: "They cannot
make blanket attacks on Asians anymore with impunity."

Another reason is that the issue of campaign contributions from
foreign sources is a Pandora's box for more than a few Republicans.

"The New York Times pointed out that the Republicans have been
getting money from many foreign companies," Kim noted.

Democratic spokesmen, on the other hand, have played on the
sentiment of minority voters in the US by explaining James Riady's
ties to the Democrats in terms of his interest in civil rights as
a member of Indonesia's ethnic-Chinese minority.

With Asian-Americans assuming a critical role as swing voters in a
fragmented US electorate, it may well be that both Dole and Clinton
want to avoid biting the hand which holds crucial votes in this and
future elections.

According to US analysts, a number of key swing states in the
upcoming presidential election already have sizable numbers of
potential Asian-American voters.

There are 600,000 Asian-Americans in Texas and another 200,000 in
Florida. Asian-Americans also constitute at least one-tenth of the
overall population of California and are growing in numbers in
states like New York, Massachusetts and Illinois.

Julian Weiss, a spokesman for the non-partisan Heritage Foundation
in Washington, said: "In the aftermath of this election, there will
be a far more vigorous attempt by both major parties to mobilize
the Asian-American vote."

Peace prizes and troublemakers

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

On Sunday, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered the country's
Bureau of Immigration and Deportation to ban the entry of
individuals suspected of wishing to disrupt the APEC Summit,
scheduled to be held in Manila next month.

Although no direct reference was made, it was believed that the
president's directive included the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize awardee
Jose Ramos Horta. Horta was invited to participate in an
alternative APEC meeting to be held by human rights activists in
the country.

The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has also been ordered
not to issue a visa to anyone who might embarrass the Philippines
as APEC host.

On Monday, Indonesia welcomed Ramos' announcement, saying it would
contribute to the successful outcome of the APEC Summit.

A spokesman said Jakarta did not want any elements of the summit
which might create an embarrassment for the Philippine government.

China hopes to clear the theater

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

In an address to the 51st session of the United Nations General
Assembly last Friday, Chinese Disarmament ambassador Sha Zukang
urged countries concerned to cease immediately the research,
development and deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems
(TMD).

Sha gave two reasons for such an appeal. First, "The so-called TMD
which certain countries are going all-out to develop will in fact
possess the capacity to intercept strategic missiles, thus breaking
the limits imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and
rendering the treaty virtually meaningless", he said.

The second reason is that the TMD will lead to the proliferation of
advanced missile systems and the related technologies, thus posing
a threat to regional and even global security and stability.

"In a word, there is nothing to gain but everything to lose from
the development of the TMD system," he said.

TMDs in the region are mainly being produced by the United States
for use by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

What if we threw a party?

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

It was supposed to be a gala party. On the occasion of the fifth
anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords, which technically ended the
country's civil war, the Cambodian government hoped to attract
ministers or senior officials from all 19 of the accords'
signatories to a massive celebration outside the royal palace.

The festivities, which were to be held on Wednesday in Phnom Penh,
were likely intended to confirm the legitimacy of the government
that arose from the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, head-
ed by royalist First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had led the Vietnamese-backed
Phnom Penh government at the time of the signing.

But alas, it was not to be. For some reason, nobody seems to be all
that interested in Cambodia these days. Of the signatories, only
Malaysia and Laos are sending ministers to the celebration. Six
other countries are offering lower-ranking or retired officials.
The other countries are content to be represented by their
ambassadors to Phnom Penh or not at all.

The United Nations, which presided over the Cambodian elections in
a high-profile mission led by Japan, does not seem particularly
prepared to crow to the world about its success. The organization
will have a presence at the celebrations, but only in the form of
its special representative in Cambodia.

King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia was originally slated to preside
over the festivities, but because of the disappointing turnout, he
has apparently decided to defer that responsibility to the
country's parliamentary chairman, Chea Sim, who usually acts as the
king's regent in his absence from Cambodia.

Japan's father and son acts

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

Rare is the Japanese politician who does not want to build a
dynasty. It has been commonplace for sons of lawmakers to inherit
their fathers' support organizations and as a result, in many
cases, their seats in the parliament. (Where no adult sons are
available, wives are the next choice.)

One dramatic example occurred during the recent campaign in Kobe,
where former health and welfare minister Saburo Toida died just one
week before the election - but five days after he had filed as a
candidate. His son Tooru was chosen as the Liberal Democratic Party
candidate, and went on to win against a strong campaigner from the
opposition Shinshin-to.

But in a macabre twist, the late minister's promotional video,
which he had recorded before his death, was repeatedly broadcast
over NHK Television during the campaign. The reason: Official
campaign regulations prohibit the substitution of a candidate's
film footage after his party has submitted it to the authorities.
All NHK could do was attach an announcement that the senior Toida
had died.

Hard time for ex-bureaucrats

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

Only 14 out of the 41 first-time candidates in this past Sunday's
Japanese parliamentary elections who were formerly bureaucrats
could claim the right to put the much-coveted gold pins on their
jackets when the votes were tallied.

Only one out of eight ex-Finance Ministry officials running for the
first time won in this year's race and no former Health and Welfare
Ministry worker was able to succeed in a maiden campaign.

In a general campaign atmosphere of bureaucrat-bashing, with most
parties pledging to make administrative reform an important
priority, many such candidates were unable to take full advantage
of their illustrious career backgrounds in drumming up support,
even from related private sector organizations, according to Nihon
Keizai Shimbun.

In the past few years, it had become a pattern for at least 60
percent of such ex-bureaucrat candidates to win their debut races.
This year's reversals can be directly traced to the various
recently-unveiled scandals involving a number of previously
sacrosanct government ministries.

The Finance Ministry's solid reputation has been shattered by last
year's financial scandals - specifically the collapse of the seven
jusen housing loan companies and the coverup of US$1.1 billion in
losses resulting from improper bond deals by a Daiwa Bank trader in
New York.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has come under harsh
criticism for allegedly approving the sale of blood products that
ministry officials knew might be contaminated with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.

It's time for Britain to rethink its military trade-offs in Asia

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

by Damon Bristow, for Asia Times

Behind the pomp and circumstance of British monarch Queen Elizabeth
II's visit to Thailand at the end of this month is a more
down-to-earth business proposition.

The centerpiece of her stay will be a banquet to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the accession to the throne by His Majesty King
Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. And Prince Philip will also become
the first senior member of the British royal family to go to the
site of the infamous "death railway", where 13,000 prisoners of
war, many of them British and Commonwealth citizens, were interned
by the Japanese during World War II.

Behind the scenes, however, the British royals will also be working
hard to promote British trade relations with Thailand. For a start,
the queen will attend a lunch at the Bank of Thailand. After that
she will visit a major exhibition on commercial links between
Britain and Thailand.

The queen's newfound role as roving ambassador for "United Kingdom
plc" is indicative of the broader change that has occurred in
relations between the United Kingdom and Asia since she last
visited Thailand way back in 1972. At that time, Britain had
effectively withdrawn from the region.

And although the country retained political, economic and military
ties with the region - largely through the Commonwealth - these
were pretty much symbolic.

It's obviously a very different story today. After 25 years of
average economic growth across the region topping six percent a
year, a somewhat previously dormant Europe has finally woken up to
Asia.

In the meantime, many Asian countries are starting to make their
voices heard in the international arena, particularly in the United
Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Add to that the sprouting of regional political and economic
architecture in the years since the end of the Cold War: The ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), which looks at security matters, and its
trade-related sidekick, the Asia- Pacific Economic Co-operation
(APEC) forum.

Britain has not been able to ignore these developments. In an
acknowledgement of this fact, British Prime Minister John Major
announced in 1994 that every effort would be made to reinvigorate
the country's long-standing relations with the region.

This year a stream of senior British politicians have been doing
the rounds in Asia, talking about trade, politics and security
ties.

British exports to the Asia-Pacific region, as a percentage of
those outside Europe rose from 11.7 percent in 1991 to a little
over 25 percent in 1993. The following year they increased by over
27 percent to a little over &pound;14 billion (US$22.3 billion).
Britain is also the largest European Union investor in the region.
The economic benefits, however, have not only been one way: 41
percent of all Japanese and 47 percent of all South Korean
investments in Europe are in the United Kingdom.

Britain has also moved to underpin this growing economic
relationship by improving political ties. At an institutional
level, for example, every effort is being made to exploit links
with its partners in the Commonwealth and its membership of the EU,
which has had relations with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations since the 1970s.

Bilateral relations, too, have been strengthened. To its credit,
London has been successful in building links with all the most
influential countries in Asia. Group of Seven member Japan has been
the major recipient of Britain's attentions.

The relationship with Tokyo is now so strong that last month,
British Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind visited Japan and signed
a groundbreaking Action Agenda for a Special Partnership with his
Japanese counterparts.

The document committed both countries to unprecedented levels of
cooperation in world affairs, economic issues and in fostering
closer links between the UK and Europe.

Relations with South Korea are progressing down a similar track.
And, as the deadline for the handover of Hong Kong approaches, ties
with China have also improved markedly, even though Britain has
made clear its intention to stand up for the territory for a
further 50 years after that.

And although the British government doesn't like to flaunt it,
relations with Indonesia are also pretty close.

With the Hong Kong withdrawal just around the corner, Britain has
stepped up its efforts to convince its partners in the region that
the British armed forces will continue to take an active interest
in Asia's security - unlike its competitors in the EU, Britain has
security links with the region through the Five Power Defense
Arrangement (FPDA), which brings Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Singapore and the United Kingdom together for exercises twice a
year. The country also has historical links due to its
participation in the Korean War.

Recently, British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo announced that
the biggest task force to leave the United Kingdom since the
Falklands War would take part in an upgraded FPDA exercise off the
coast of Malaysia in April next year with the Aircraft carrier
Illustrious at its head. This was followed by a speech in Australia
during which Portillo expressed his belief that

the UK should be made a member of ARF independent of the EU.

Furthermore, when South Korean President Kim Young-sam was in
London, Britain made clear its support of the 1994 October
Declaration between the United States and North Korea, which was
designed to freeze Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. It even
agreed to contribute money to the Korean Peninsula Economic
Development Organization (KEDO) and provided the North with
&pound;150,000 in disaster aid after last year's devastating
floods.

Britain usually justifies its desire to continue playing a security
role in Asia by referring to the fact that the country has large
investments and "long-standing ties" in the region.

In a slightly more roundabout way, it is hoped that showing the
flag might also help the United Kingdom to carve out a larger piece
of Asia's growing markets. The question of whether or not Britain
actually has the ability to deal with a crisis in Asia - say in the
South China Sea or the Korean peninsula - is, however, a moot
point.

According to current British military thinking, after Hong Kong
reverts back to Chinese sovereignty, any military emergency in the
region would be met by the using of the newly-established Joint
Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF), which is specifically designed to
deal with distant regional contingencies. At the core of this force
will be the 3 Commando and 5 Airborne brigades. They, in turn,
would be able to draw on resources from the rest of the armed
forces if required.

The problem is that the British Armed Services are stretched to the
limit at the moment. The total strength of the military has been
reduced steadily from 292,000 in 1992/93, to 250,000 last year. On
top of this, existing commitments mean that Britain has around
17,000 troops in Northern Ireland and just short of 10,500 in
Bosnia. That's not to mention long-standing commitments to security
in the Gulf.

Bearing in mind these constraints, the physical distance between
Asia and the UK and the cost of sending and sustaining a force a
long way from British shores, the chances are that Britain would
not only find it pretty difficult to send a few navy vessels to
patrol the South China Sea, let alone commit ground troops to a
major conflict on the Korean peninsula, but would think twice
before it made such a commitment. Even if they did get there, at
current levels, the chances are any force would be little more than
symbolic.

To the current generation of policy makers in the region that does
not seem to matter: For them, the country's continued security
commitment to the region is essential to justify its position as a
major power with an international reach and global interests as
well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

That's fine in the short term. In the next few years, however,
Britain will have to decide whether or not it makes sense to retain
its military commitment to the region, even in its current, anemic
form.

To this end, the country might do well to take a leaf out of the
book of its European partners, who have been almost as successful
in securing business in Asia and exercising their influence as
Britain has without making halfhearted commit-ments that they would
be hard pressed to keep. Perhaps the time has finally come for
Britain to follow them down the same route.

Japan: That empty feeling

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

A senior Japanese journalist posted a note to an Internet
discussion group on Monday which constituted the most poignant
commentary on Sunday's election and is worth summarizing.

He was watching the television election programs on Sunday night,
he wrote, and was struck by the historically low voter turnout. It
was beyond his comprehension, given that Japan in the past couple
of years had experienced everything unprecedented, from the near
collapse of its banking system to a major earthquake to a religious
cult's terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway.

The biggest question for him was not how the coalition was going to
be formed, but simply the voters' attitude, which he would not even
call apathy, as that still connoted the existence of individual
decision-making. They just don't care about anything, he suggested,
be it about Ijime in public school systems or about Rodong missiles
that North Korea was reportedly about to launch. How had Japan
gotten this empty, precisely as described in Yukio Mishima's often
cited predictions?

We don't know if the journalist wrote a similar commentary for his
own - one of Japan's biggest - newspapers. If he didn't, he should
have.

It is important not to misunderstand his reference to the novelist
Mishima, the man whose desperate nationalism drove him to publicly
disembowel himself with his samurai sword to rouse his nation. The
reference was surely not intended as an endorsement of Mishima's
eccentric existentialist nationalism. But as C P Snow once wrote,
"Mishima's characters are observed with the sharpest of eyes...
clear, eloquent, visual". His characterization of an "empty Japan"
had that same element of precision.

Just consider some of today's lead news stories out of Tokyo:

l A Japanese finance company filed for liquidation with massive
debt liabilities of more than US$8.8 billion, spurring worries
about the health of other finance companies. The liability figure
makes Nichiei Finance the largest such insolvency case in post-war
Japan.

l United States Central Intelligence Agency director John Deutch
has discussed with Japanese leaders North Korea's reported move to
test-launch the Rodong-1 missile. The missile has a target range of
1,000km, is capable of reaching Japan, and can be fitted with
nuclear or chemical warheads.

l The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said its
index of economic indicators for August fell below the "boom or
bust" mark for the first time in five months.

l The Liberal Democratic Party said Japan's government would likely
be on hold for at least two weeks until a coalition is stitched
together.

How, in light of such acute and simmering problems, could more than
40 percent of Japanese voters have chosen to spend election day
with such favorite pastimes as autumn leaf viewing or watching a
baseball game, rather than participate in the election of a
political leadership capable of addressing the country's woes.

The unnamed journalist's commentary on his fellow Japanese's state
of mindlessness and his pessimism about the future appear
well-justified.

The Finance Ministry will now roll out the fire brigade and douse
the Nichiei problem, likely at the voters' - or non-voters' -
expense. Japan's Defense Agency chief told reporters he was closely
watching the Rodong test situation, but that none of the
information obtained was "solid". And whatever coalition ends up
being stitched together will likely respond to the bad economic
data with yet another supplementary pork-barrel budget.

On this last issue, one man not re-elected, outgoing EPA
director-general Shusei Tanaka, urged that Japan must press ahead
with economic reform and avoid the easy option of trying to spend
its way out of trouble. But as we said, he was defeated.

One last bit of news: After a year of intense lobbying against
rival India, Japan on Tuesday was given a nonpermanent seat at the
UN Security Council. One wonders what, if anything, the Japanese
representative filling that seat might have to say to the world.

Hyundai wins vote of confidence in Israel

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 7

by Yaroslav Trofimov

South Korea's Hyundai Group is poised to become a major supplier in
the Israeli telecommunications market in the wake of its US$12.5
million deal with the Jewish state's telephone monopoly Bezeq.

Bezeq, whose 1996 annual purchasing budget is roughly US$1 billion,
has ordered from Hyundai 130,000 kilometers of optic fiber for its
cable network modernization program.

The deal was finalized at a meeting between Bezeq's president Isaac
Kaul and Hyundai's manager of planning and electronics departments,
Park Hyeong-sun.

The Korean fiber, which is scheduled to be produced within two
weeks, will be tested on Bezeq's request by the US-based Bellcore
Corporation. Bezeq said that, should these tests be satisfactory,
the company will sign by late 1998 an additional contract for an
undisclosed sum that industry analysts estimated could reach over
US$100 million annually.

Currently, Bezeq buys most of its cable from two Israeli companies,
Cvalim and Kavlei Zion. Only about 15 percent of Bezeq supplies
come from foreign manufacturers, such as Alcatel, Motorola and
Northern Telecom. Hyundai is the first Asian company to make
significant sales to Bezeq.

After opening an office in Tel Aviv in 1994, the Korean giant
racked up more than US$100 million in sales last year to the Jewish
state. The bulk of these exports were Accent and Lantra passenger
cars.

Bezeq's spokesman, Roni Mandelbaum, explained that considerations
of both quality and price prompted his company to turn to Hyundai.
"We have no advantage buying outside of Israel if the product is
not better. Korea is a very long distance away, and if we decided
to go for it, this means that there is an advantage for us there,"
Mandelbaum said.

He added that Hyundai's optic fiber will be used for Bezeq
operations inside Israel and not in its foreign ventures, such as
the troubled Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited
(HFCL)-Bezeq consortium in India.

As Bezeq officials explained, the Hyundai deal is part of the
company's new overall strategy of searching for more cost-effective
suppliers in nontraditional markets, such as Asia.

In accordance with Israel's deregulation program, Bezeq is expected
to lose as early as next year its lucrative monopoly on
long-distance telephone services - which means that it has to
undergo immediate cost-cutting in order to survive the new
competition.

"In the framework of Bezeq's preparation to deal with the
competition, the company must become more efficient in all
sectors," said Kaul.

"One of the central items in company expenses is purchasing costs.
Bezeq will do everything possible to reduce purchasing costs and
tariffs while, of course, preserving the high standard of product
quality," Kaul added.

Several international consortiums, including one led by Korea
Telecom, are bidding for the two licences to run Israel's
alternative long-distance networks.

Asian investors buying into South American bread basket

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6

by Andrea Mandel-Campbell

After years of neglect, Argentina's agricultural sector is
beginning to grow and Asian countries are among those setting their
sights on the South American country as a potential source of food
for their growing populations.

A handful of Asian countries have quietly begun making tentative
land purchases in Argentina's agriculturally rich interior,
according to Argentine government sources.

Since direct foreign investment is not officially registered in
Argentina it is almost impossible to track the investments, but
sources said Taiwanese investors had acquired farmland near the
capital of Buenos Aires while South Korean interests had chosen the
nearby province of Entre Rios to launch large-scale grain
production.

South Korean conglomerates, including the Daewoo Group and Hyundai
Group, were also taking a serious look at adding farming to their
Argentine investment portfolio, said South Korean sources.

But perhaps the greatest interest is coming from China, where
present direct investment in Argentina is estimated at only US$20
million. About 10 Chinese corporations, including grain
import-export concern Ceroil Foods, were looking at investment
between US$10 million and US$15 million each in farmland, said
Ernesto Fernandez Taboada, executive director of the Argentine
Chamber of Commerce for Southeast Asia.

The Chinese were studying Argentine agricultural regulations and
technology with the aim of harvesting and processing crops in
Argentina for later export to China, said Taboada. To date, they
have acquired "experimental" plots ranging from 300 to 600 hectares
in three provinces to grow grain and cotton Argentina's leading
exports to China along with vegetable and animal-based oils.

"China has decided to make investment in Latin America a priority.
The Chinese know that in the future Latin America is going to be
one of the great food providers while China is going to need a lot
more foodstuffs," said Taboada.

"The living standards of China's growing middle class are rising
every year and with that increase they want to eat more
sophisticated things and a greater variety of them. So the demand
for more and better food is continually increasing and that
obligates China to look outside its borders for reliable providers
of food, among which is Latin America."

The Chinese were also interested in agro-industry, with several
companies looking to establish grain processing plants and
vegetable oil plants, he said.

It is a move the Taiwanese, importers of Argentine grain, soya,
corn and cotton, have already made. Taipei's Winluck Industries,
owned by entrepreneur Sheng Hsiung Ho, is getting set to build a
second processing plant in Argentina for US$35 million that will
process corn, soya and peanuts. And the Chaintech Group recently
said it signed an accord with the Argentine province of Tucuman to
build a US$50 million fruit plant.

"A lot of Taiwanese see the potential of the food industry here and
a lot of people are looking for investment opportunities," said
Alfonso Yio-Yih Tao, director of the economic division of the
Taipei commercial and cultural office.

Grain and other foodstuffs are also high on the list of Argentina's
largest Asian trading partner, Japan. Also, Argentina's most
important Asian investor, the Japanese, who have so far focused on
car plants, are beginning to turn their attention to agriculture.

During the last meeting of the business-based Argentine-Japanese
Mixed Committee, the Japanese concluded that Argentina "was a
reliable provider of high-quality products, had become a
particularly attractive site for agricultural and agro-industry
investment, especially in view of Mercosur [Southern Common
Market]".

Being the largest grain supplier to Mercosur, the customs zone made
up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Argentina held a
major attraction as well for investment mogul George Soros.

In 1994 Soros' Quantum Industrial Partners bought a 40 percent
share in Cresud, a commodities producer based in Argentina.

Since then, Cresud has increased its holdings from 20,000 to
346,000 hectares of croplands and forests, and more than doubled
its livestock to become the country's leading commodities producer.

The influx of market capital and investment in technology has
helped trigger a rebirth of the long-neglected industry which has
suffered from years of over taxation and hyper-inflation.

"Last year Argentine GDP fell 4.4 percent whereas agriculture grew
more than nine percent - it's a sector in full expansion. We're
seeing 100 percent growth in all areas, from fertilizers and
irrigation systems to tractor sales," said Cresud director
Alejandro Elsztain.

"We had many bad years and for many years we have been behind, but
now we are beginning to see a turnaround. We are rediscovering what
we have."

And what Argentina has is a distinct comparative advantage,
according to Elsztain, when it comes to land. The country still
possesses vast tracts of undeveloped land at cheap prices, selling
for half to one-fifth the price of equivalent quality land in North
America and Europe. And with few countries in a position to
increase production levels as global consumption rises, Elsztain
predicts Argentina will once again become a leading global exporter
of grains and milk.

"Asia, along with Russia, are going to be the markets that will
make us into major exporters and will become very rich markets for
us," said Elsztain.

Innovation the key to sporting goods empire

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6

by M Shankar

Jagdev Singh was distraught on the day he opened his first shop in
Singapore. By early afternoon, not a single thing had been sold.

"I was a dead man," he said.

Not quite. That store was the first of 218 outlets that, 17 years
later, sprawl across Southeast Asia and are part of a S$300 million
(US$210 million) sporting goods empire.

Singh, or J S Gill as he prefers to be called, introduced a number
of innovations to Singapore retailers, including the concept of
fixed pricing instead of bargaining individually with each
customer.

He reckons half of the sporting goods now sold on the island come
from his Royal Sporting House outlets.

The family-owned business of this 42-year-old, who dreamed as a boy
of owning a pair of Adidas shoes, is the exclusive distributor for
Reebok products in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Brunei, and retails 27 other top-of-the-line brands, ranging
from Wilson and Spalding to Speedo and Lacoste.

The Indian entrepreneur left home at the age of 24, with plans to
become an engineer. His family did not approve.

"My father thought that I would come back," he said.

Indeed, Gill's career plans did not work out, and he fell back on
the only thing he knew well - sporting goods, in which he had
worked for his father.

But rather than return to the family business, he struck out on his
own.

He was aided early on by the reputation of his father, whose
Indonesia-based business bought sporting goods in Singapore.

Gill had no money to stock his first store, but wholesalers and
distributors who knew his father agreed to accept checks post-dated
by 30 days.

So he opened a checking account with S$100 and bought about
S$60,000 in sporting goods to stock his 30 square meter shop at
Lucky Plaza, on Singapore's fashionable Orchard Road.

"I had the best merchandise," said Gill. "The shop was beautifully
done. On November 23, 1979, I opened the business thinking I would
do the sales and deposit the money and the thing would start
rolling."

But by 1.00pm on the first day of business he had not sold a thing.

"I said: 'Bloody hell, I am dead now. What am I going to do? The
checks will not be honored'." He added: "Anyhow, when you are at
that stage, you've got nothing to lose. The guy can't hang you -
basically he would have taken back the goods."

At any rate, it was not a problem, the moribund morning was
followed by a robust afternoon with sales totaling S$3,500.

"That was my first day collection. I said to myself: 'Now, there is
no looking back'."

Over the next nine years he gradually expanded his business into 15
outlets.

"He spearheaded a lot of retail concepts that were new to the
industry [in Singapore], like fixed prices and visually-appealing
in-store merchandising," said Jeffrey Bose, president of Sing-
apore's Sports Goods Dealers Association and managing director of
Hwa Kay Thai, a regional group that licenses the Puma brand in
seven countries.

"That was groundbreaking. Today 75 percent of sports good retailers
sell on fixed price and a lot of people have a lot to thank Gill
for."

But big-time success came in 1988, when Gill was granted the
regional distributorship for Reebok.

Gill was up against such heavyweights as Britain's Inchcape,
Malaysia-based Sime Darby and others. But he was resolute. "I was
chasing them, especially during the big trade shows held every
year," Gill said.

He also had the dream, harking back to his childhood love for their
shoes, of acquiring the Adidas franchise.

Gill drew up a business plan in 1987. He made one copy for Adidas
and another for Reebok. He then went with a member of his staff to
Germany to attend the Ispo trade fair, near Munich.

He saw a long queue of people eager to meet Reebok executives.

"Reebok then was the hottest thing going. Adidas was a 50-year-old
company - stable but sliding down," said Gill.

When his turn came, Gill went into a room with the Reebok export
director.

"He saw my face, he said: 'Okay this is your plan? Fine, put it
here, we will contact you'. He took my plan, there was a big box,
and he just dumped it there," said Gill.

Next he visited Adidas.

Gill, who was already doing some business with the German-based
sporting goods maker, said the company gave him a patient hearing
and told him they were not happy with their franchise arrangements
in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Three months later, Adidas told Gill they would like to talk with
him further, at the upcoming trade fair in Atlanta, about a
proposal to grant him the distributorship for the region.

As about the same time the letter from Adidas arrived in Singapore,
so did Reebok president Joe Foster.

Royal Sporting House was already a key player in Singapore's
upscale sporting goods market. Walking through the city's retail
district, Foster was impressed with the displays and merchandise in
Gill's stores, and telephoned him.

"He was staying at the Raffles Hotel, I still remember. He called
me and I went running to see him," said Gill with a laugh.

Foster had not even seen the plan Gill had submitted at the Ispo
fair, but having seen his stores, he asked if Gill was interested
in becoming Reebok's distributor, and they agreed to discuss it
further in Atlanta.

Arriving in the United States, Gill met an Adidas representative in
Atlanta's Mariott Hotel the day before the trade show was to begin,
and was offered a distributorship.

Walking back across the street to his own room in the Hilton,
Adidas' letter of intent in hand, he ran into Reebok's president.

Foster told Gill he wanted to meet him the following morning. "
'But more or less I have made up my mind. We want to go with you',"
Gill recalled Foster saying.

"When I was putting the two plans [together], my staff member had
warned me: 'Mr Gill... what happens if both of them come back to
you?' I said: 'That will never be possible. We are so small, they
are giants'."

Back in Singapore with two letters of intent, Gill called for a
vote among his staff to decide which franchise to accept. They
voted for the more established company - Adidas.

But Gill's heart was in Reebok: "I said, this is hot, it will grow
and it will help us to grow faster."

Two months later, he was still in a quandary. Finally, he wrote the
names of the companies on two pieces of paper and told his
six-year-old daughter to pick one.

"I told her, whatever is your luck, let it be so. So she picked up;
it was Reebok. I said, okay we go with Reebok. That is a decision
made, and it was destiny."

And the business took off. Spreading across Southeast Asia, Royal
Sporting House now has 153 outlets outside Singapore, as well as
manufacturing facilities making swimwear and other sports apparel
in Banting in the Malaysian state of Selangor.

Two years ago, he launched his own footwear brand, Ogaan, in
Indonesia.

Along the way, Gill won the Singapore Enterprise of the Year Award
in 1993, the International Sports Retailer of the Year Award in
1994 and the Speciality Store of the Year Award in 1995.

Gill still does not have any partners or shareholders. He manages
the business with his wife and a team of professionals and never
involves himself in joint ventures in which he does not have a
controlling stake. Even in a sporting-good distribution joint
venture with Indonesia's multibillion dollar Gajahtunggal group, he
owns a majority stake.

"J S Gill has a general feel and gut instinct about the sporting
goods industry and his entrepreneurial instincts are very strong,"
said Bill Sweeney, vice-president for Reebok Inter- national.

Sweeney explained that there was no conflict in the fact that Gill
sells brands made by Reebok's competitors.

"There is a difference between a retail stockist and a distributor.
It is also a challenge for us [Reebok] to make our brand more
attractive vis-a-vis other brands displayed in a selling
environment.

Gill added: "I cannot distribute any other brand except Reebok, but
I can stock all the other brands, including Nike [Reebok's main
competitor], in my retail stores."

But Gill has also suffered setbacks. About seven years ago he
opened a specialty 12-outlet chain called Big Foot Little Foot,
selling fashionable and trendy footwear for Singaporeans and
Indonesians of all ages. It closed two years later.

"I think you have to take failure in life and move on," said Gill.

Indeed, in the past two years he has begun diversifying into the
fashion industry once again.

Other innovations may not be paying off now, but Gill said he was
taking a long-term view and did not cling to demands for immediate
commercial viability.

One such venture is his Golf House mobile workshop, which will
polish and repair golf clubs right on the golf course.

"One of his strengths is he is not afraid to try something new,"
said Sweeney. "And if a concept does not work, he is also quick to
take corrective action and address his mistakes. Like when he went
on a retail expansion spree in Singapore, he quickly realized that
he was making a mistake and refocused on smaller volumes but better
quality."

Bose of the Sports Goods Dealers Association added: "That he is not
afraid of trying does not go against him."

Gill plans to expand to other markets when the timing is right.

"I will be ready to go into India, when India takes off," he said,
though he said he thought China, with its many shopping malls, had
a better retail setup for the time being, adding that an offer was
on the table for him to start a joint venture there.

Although Gill's father, who died last March, had not approved of
him striking out on his own, he ultimately approved of his son's
undertakings.

"My father was very proud of me," said Gill. As for not supporting
him at first, he said: "I don't blame him... the world is changing
and I don't think my children will necessarily listen to me.

"Maybe the world was changing at that time, and my father was not
ready to accept that. I always wanted to be a free, young man and
independent, and do something on my own. It was not that it was the
reason to break up from the family, but it was the idea to do your
own thing."

He said he had enough of taking direction from others. "I went
through that. So, I told myself - get out!"

Another reason for his leaving home, he said, was that, at that
age, you have nothing to fear because you have nothing to lose.

As for the future, Bose said he saw competition on Gill's home turf
growing stronger.

"The closest competitor to Royal Sporting House would be World of
Sports, belonging to the Ossia Group, which started just four to
five years back but is one of the fastest growing companies," Bose
said.

Gill does not express concern, however. With a growing legion of
people in Asia interested in sports, he hopes his recipe of local
expertise and strong entrepreneurial skills will keep his cash
registers ringing.

US Fed explores scandal avoidance measures

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 5

by Gene Koprowski

United States officials are examining new measures aimed at
averting trading scandals such as the Daiwa Bank losses and the
collapse of Barings.

Failure to comply with the measures would result in institutions
facing censure through public disclosure - and corresponding
implications in credit ratings and raising capital - rather than
straightforward financial penalties.

Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago were finalizing
a study for December release which examined whether the Federal
Reserve should impose public disclosure requirements on banks that
traded derivatives and futures, government officials said.

The study was undertaken because of the Fed's concern that a
trading scandal, similar to the Barings and Daiwa Bank crises or
the Sumitomo copper losses, could undermine US financial markets.

As talks proceed, former copper trading king Yasuo Hamanaka was
arrested on Tuesday on charges that he forged documents to create
secret trading accounts. The arrest came after Sumitomo Corp filed
a legal complaint against Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader,
who it blamed for a US$2.6 billion loss from unauthorized copper
deals.

Douglas Evanoff, a senior economist and assistant vice-president at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the completed report on
improving public disclosure would be discussed as the basis for
possible regulation with the other member banks of the Federal
Reserve System. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as
well as the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices - an organization of the world's central bankers - will
also be consulted.

The idea was first floated internally earlier this year at the Fed
by economists Paul Kubiak and Jim O'Brien in Washington. Staff at
the Chicago branch of the Fed, one of 12 regional banks in the
Federal Reserve System, picked up the idea and developed it
further.

By midyear they convinced Michael Moskow, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, to discuss the idea in a speech about
derivatives, and in subsequent remarks, Evanoff said.

"We think it is something that can influence their behavior when
institutions realize their name has been made public," he said.
"We're trying to develop the optimal penalty structure."

The central bankers, simultaneously, are eyeing a pilot program,
launched last month by the New York Clearing House Association -
the international organization of banks which clear trades in the
US. The program serves as an experiment with the idea of
disclosure.

Evanoff said the pilot program was starting to collect data, which
would be useful in determining the efficacy of the plan. The first
phase of the plan would run through the fourth quarter. "All of
this sounds great conceptually, but we want to see if the idea is
viable in implementation," he said. The pilot program was first
mentioned in June.

Moskow said: "Bank capital, and ultimately the Bank Insurance Fund,
is at risk if the value of a bank's trading book falls rapidly due
to a sudden change in market prices. Fears of a bank collapse
triggered by such changes have been exacerbated by the increased
use of derivatives.

"Consider the collapse of Barings last year, which was the result
of a high-stakes bet on the direction of Japanese stocks using
derivatives traded on the SIMEX [Singapore International Monetary
Exchange] and the Osaka exchange... If improperly used, derivatives
make it easier for an imprudent institution to damage itself, the
Bank Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the financial
services sector," he said.

Evanoff said the pilot program was helping the participants several
unnamed financial institutions - examine their present exposure to
risk from derivatives and just how much they should allocate to
cover that risk. Insiders said the first phase ran through this
quarter and it was likely to be extended for more than a year
beyond that.

What are the reporting requirements of the pilot program? According
to David Marshall, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago, banks involved in the New York pilot program pre-commit to
a certain level of risk for each quarter of the year.

For example, if the bank thinks the worst loss it can have in
derivatives trading during the forthcoming quarter is US$10
million, it informs regulators of that risk level. Then, at the end
of the quarter, regulators and bank officials meet to determine how
well the bank met its projections.

During the pilot program, reporting would be done on a quarterly
basis. But reporting requirements had not been finalized, Marshall
said. "The frequency of the reporting has not been worked out yet.
Some regulators want daily reporting requirements. But that may be
too onerous for banks."

The risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Basel Committee
in 1989 did not apply to off-balance sheet items, or trading book
assets. However, off-balance sheet items present a potentially
substantial risk. In the Barings case, market prices of derivatives
moved rapidly and devastated the net worth of that bank. "Clearly
there should be capital charges made to protect the system as a
whole against declines in the value of these securities," Marshall
said.

Banks would use computer programs to determine their level of risk
based upon their outstanding level of securities. "This is known as
the internal models approach," Marshall said. "Basically, the
regulator asks the bank: 'How risky is your portfolio? You tell us,
using the best tools you have.' Basically, they give us a value of
risk number."

The idea is that regulators will let the banks tell them what is
the maximum loss their portfolio will take over a threemonth
period. "What is the worst they can do over three months? That's
what we would want to know," Marshall said. "Then they take that
dollar amount, say US$10 million. They pre-commit not to lose any
more than that amount. Make that their capital charge. They have to
have enough capital set aside so that capital completely absorbs
their loss.

"Then, if the loss from derivatives exceeds that pre-committed
loss, the disclosure penalty is put into place.

"They're simultaneously choosing the risk of their portfolio and
the capital to set aside against that risk. And if we set that
penalty function correctly, then we should get them to do that in
a way which meets safety and stability requirements of regulators
and risks to the bank insurance fund," Marshall said.

US regulators are currently limited in the actions they can take on
derivatives risks and they want to try out measures to mitigate the
risks for the US financial system. Immediately following Sumitomo's
announced loss in September, the Fed took steps to determine the
size and nature of US bank exposures to the trading company and to
the copper market.

Several banks had trading or financing transactions with Sumitomo
relating to its copper trading and were owed payments by Sumitomo
in connection with those transactions. In the future, the
government would like to regulate that kind of credit risk as well.

Evanoff said although the proposed disclosure requirements were not
going to be placed on trading companies themselves, public
disclosure of risks at banks which lend to them hopefully would
continue to strengthen their internal auditing and information
systems.

"The well-publicized losses at Barings, Daiwa, Sumitomo and others
have all derived from violations of fundamental, managerial
principles of control, such as those dealing with the recording of
all positions and the adequate separation of duties. Managements
must build and maintain adequate systems for controlling risks,
whether they operate bank or non-bank institutions," said Fed board
member Susan Phillips, in Congressional testimony three weeks ago.

Dmitrius Papadimitriou, executive director of the Jerome Levy
Economics Institute, a regulatory issues think tank in Ithaca, New
York, said the proposal provided a level of "transparency" that had
been sorely lacking in the derivatives world. "It actually
encourages banks to improve their risk-assessment and
risk-management technologies," he said.

"What's more, there is no need for the regulators to impose a model
of portfolio risk in setting regulatory capital." Regulators need
only to verify initially that the bank has an adequate
risk-management structure in place, to review the bank's
profit-and-loss information.

Another benefit was that the proposal did not impose a "top-down"
regulatory structure from the federal govern- ment, but a
market-oriented approach, he said.

Financing of commodity and derivatives deals is not a new activity
for US banks. They have been involved in financing commodity
activities through their agriculture lending programs directed at
the production and sale of agricultural products, both domestically
and abroad.

More than one-quarter of all US banks have farm loans in excess of
25 percent of their total loans.

Unlike the banks' more traditional functions, their trading of
commodity derivatives, such as copper, gold and silver, has
increased in recent years, largely for the same reasons trading
activities, in general, have grown - expanded international trade,
increased demand for hedging instruments and improved methods for
managing and controlling risk and advances in computerization and
communications technology.

What impact will the study on derivatives regulation likely have
when it is released in six weeks?

Evanoff believes "this is the best way to regulate, on an
incentive-compatible basis." Marshall said: "This is a radical
departure from the command-and-control regulation structure where
we say: Hold this amount of capital and that's it. Banks tell us
how much of a capital loss they can pre-commit to."

US$8.8 billion bubble bursts

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Richard Hanson

More than half a decade after Japan's property market began to
collapse, the bubbles are still bursting.

But the latest collapse - that of Nichiei Finance under the weight
of yen1 trillion (US$8.8 billion) in debt - serves to illustrate a
huge gap in how Japan reacts to an ordinary bursting bubble and a
bubble with strong political interest involved.

Just about everyone in Japan knows the story of the liquidation
earlier this year of a group of seven jusen housing loan companies.
They collapsed with trillions of yen in bad loans, a messy process
that ended up requiring an infusion of taxpayer money by elected
politicians.

Then there is the story of Nichiei Finance. Nichiei Finance, a
subsidiary of Nichiei Co, was established in 1972 and listed its
stock on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1991.

On Tuesday, Nichiei Finance, a long-troubled medium-sized financing
company, earned its place in the record books of bankruptcy by
declaring itself broke with the largest bubble of potential bad
debt in Japan's history, showing how long it is taking for Japan to
shake off its bubbled past.

The possible bad debt is larger than the previous biggest
bankruptcy - yen590 billion left by Muramoto Construction in 1993
- and even larger than the yen685 billion ponied up by parliament
earlier this year to help liquidate the jusen, although
collectively the jusen debts were larger.

Nichiei Finance was bad news for its main creditors and
shareholders, including three of Japan's largest bank's and its
well-known (solvent) parent company, Nichiei Co, which is also in
the loan business.

They had tried to rescue the company since 1993, but the continued
fall in Japan's property prices thwarted their efforts. The debts
were just too large.

Financial institutions have loaned yen170.9 billion - about half by
Dai-Ichi Kangyo (DKB), Asahi Bank and the Bank of Yokohama - to
Nichiei Finance, which has applied for court protection under the
bankruptcy laws. The parent company will post a loss of yen12.3
billion as a result.

Dai-Ichi had yen56.9 billion in loans to Nichiei Finance, while
Asahi had yen32.2 billion and the Bank of Yokohama yen20.3 billion,
bank officials said.

"DKB, Asahi and Bank of Yokohama have manageable exposures as their
write-offs in conjunction with this fiasco will only reach about 20
percent of their expected total asset disposal amount this year,"
ING Barings Securities said.

The real "bubbles" in Nichiei Finance are the yen820 billion in
loan guarantees it extended mostly to real estate customers, the
value of whose collateral has also crashed. About yen100 billion is
a total loss, while much of the rest is dubious.

So where is the political angle?

There is none. Bar a few knock-on bankruptcies in what is known as
the non-banking sector of financing firms, there is little chance
that Nichiei Finance, the biggest financial bankruptcy in Japan's
history, will produce more than a loud drop in the black hole of
Japan's property market. There are no depositors at risk.

So why were the jusen such a big deal?

They too were just housing loan companies gone wild in the era of
property speculation, with no depositors.

The difference was that the biggest lenders to the jusen, it turned
out, were a large number of agricultural cooperatives, who blithely
lent trillions of yen to the jusen, most of which was going to be
lost, threatening their solvency.

Agricultural cooperatives did have depositors, mostly farmers, who
had the political clout to mobilize the support of the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), which depends heavily on the farm vote.

The LDP fixed it so that the agricultural cooperatives would not
lose any of the money that they loaned to the jusen, and would get
off with a token payment to help with the liquidation of those
companies.

The farmers were grateful, of course. In Japan's general election
on Sunday, they helped return the LDP to a more secure position as
the largest party in the Lower House of parliament.

Nichiei Finance should have such friends as friends of its lenders.
