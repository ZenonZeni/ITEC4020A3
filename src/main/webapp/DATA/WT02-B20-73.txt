  Home Schools, Private Schools, Parochial Schools--What Are A Public School's 
Special Education Obligations?<BR>
  Opuda, Michael J.<BR>

  Target Audience: Policymakers<BR>
  This paper examines issues related to the provision of special education 
services by public schools to students in private, parochial, or home school 
settings and offers guidelines for local education agencies.  First, the paper 
reviews federal statutory and regulatory obligations, particularly those under 
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Education 
Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), and advisory rulings of 
the Office of Special Education Programs and the Office for Civil Rights.  It 
also reviews case law, including Zobrest versus Catalina Foothills School 
District (decided by the U.S.  Supreme Court), Goodall versus Stafford County 
School Board (decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals), Florence County 
District Four versus Carter (U.S.  Supreme Court), Work versus McKenzie 
(District Court in the District of Columbia), McNair versus Cardimone (Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals), Wright versus Saco School Department (decided by the 
Maine Supreme Court), Tribble versus Montgomery County Board of Education (U.S. 
District Court, Alabama), and Felter versus Cape Girardeau School District (U.S.
District Court, Missouri).  Noted is the ambiguity of advice from the 
Department of Education and the tendencies of the court system to rely upon the 
plain language of the law.  The paper concludes with an outline of a public 
school's obligations for private school children, options for a public school, 
and parental rights and options.  (DB)<BR>

  This book is a guide to providing library resources and services that support 
homeschooling.  The first section contains an overview of the homeschooling 
movement, statistics that show a nationwide trend toward this form of 
education, and an examination of the motivations, philosophies and educational 
styles of homeschoolers.  The second section discusses how to determine the 
needs of homeschoolers and how to establish policies and programs that reflect 
those needs.  Sample programs and services are presented in the words of 
librarians who have worked with homeschoolers.  There is a list of the ten most 
requested topics for books and materials, lists of what homeschoolers liked the 
most and the least about their libraries, and suggestions from homeschoolers on 
how to provide better service.  In the third section, critical issues in 
planning services are described: materials selection, intellectual freedom, 
balanced collections, and censorship.  The fourth section looks at the future 
role of libraries in terms of the library as a "homeschool laboratory," 
cooperation between libraries, homeschoolers and school districts, and the 
onset of online home education.  Appendices provide various sources for 
information on homeschooling including: homeschooling organizations; 
periodicals, newspapers, newsletters; correspondence schools and instructional 
service providers; homeschool curriculum and resource suppliers and publishers; 
suppliers of home education video and audiotapes; educational and/or 
homeschooling software suppliers; online home education connections; and a 
bibliography, as well as a homeschooling survey for librarians.  (AEF)<BR>

  The District of Columbia Board of Education recognizes home schooling as an 
option for parents.  This option allows a parent or guardian to provide 
instruction to his or her own children, but not for an instructor to teach non-
related children in a home setting.  This document, compiled by the District of 
Columbia Public Schools, provides guidelines for parents to conduct a home 
instructional program.  The guidelines include a copy of the "Notice of Intent 
to Provide Home Instruction Form," along with guidelines for submission.  The 
implications of providing false or misleading information in the process are 
also addressed, as are procedures for terminating home instruction.  
Documentation accompanying the guidelines includes the following: (1) "D.C.  
Law 8-247"; (2) "Final Rulemaking" document; (3) a 1995-96 District of Columbia 
Public Schools calendar; and (4) "Homeschool Resources," which includes lists 
of periodicals, organizations, books, and publishers.  (BGC)<BR>

  A small but increasing number of school-aged children are engaging in home 
schooling--pursuing learning at home or elsewhere in the community.  This 
digest summarizes research findings on and issues around home schooling.  It 
describes the historical roots of home schooling, the estimated number of 
participants, the constitutionality and legal issues surrounding it, and the 
resources available to home schoolers.  The effect of home schooling on 
children's social development is also examined.  Disagreement exists about 
which is more beneficial to children--spending more time with mixed-age groups 
or with their peers.  Public opinion is divided about home schooling.  It is 
primarily opposed by professional educators' unions and associations; however, 
the parents' right to homeschool their children is generally upheld by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, most state legislatures, and the majority of 
respondents to a Gallup poll.  (LMI)<BR>

  Noting that most home-schooling materials adhere to conventional schooling at 
the cost of creativity, this handbook provides guidelines for building a 
successful home school curriculum, one that avoids student resentment and 
parent burnout, targets children's interest and motivation, and understands how 
a child's developmental stages contribute to learning.  The guide is based on 
the Moore Formula for home schooling, which emphasizes a creative curriculum, 
skill-building work, and community or family service, and which results in low 
stress, low cost, and high achievement and sociability.  The chapters in the 
book are divided into the following five parts: (1) "Can Homeschooling Be Both 
Successful and Stress-Free?"; (2) "Homeschooling Stress: Prevention and 
Remedy"; (3) "Making Homeschooling Successful"; (4) "Effective Homeschoolers 
Share Their Wisdom"; and (5) "Some Encouraging Information for Parents and 
Educators." A concise description of the Moore Formula for home schooling is 
presented in an epilogue.  (SW)<BR>

  This theme issue focuses on techniques for effectively parenting gifted 
students.  In "Parenting the Middle School Gifted Child," Sharon Freitas 
provides suggestions for communicating with adolescents and understanding their 
needs as they strive for increasing independence.  "In Search of the Owner's 
Manual" (Terrie Gray) documents the search for a child-rearing formula.  "An 
Adolescent Already  Understanding and Meeting the Needs of Your Developing 
Gifted Child" (Richard Swart) reviews the development of gifted children and 
describes how these developmental differences often account for school 
problems, difficulties in family relationships, and emotional problems.  
"Gifted Kids Don't Come with a Set of Instructions" (Fran Westbrook) discusses 
the gifted label, the need for permission to fail, the need for a stimulating 
home environment, teaching responsibility, underachievement, and advocacy.  
"Self-Concept and the Gifted Child: Executive Summary" (Robert D. Hoge and 
Joseph S. Renzulli) addresses differences between gifted and average children 
in their self-concepts, effects on self-concept of labeling a child, and impact 
on self-concept of placing the child in a separate enriched or accelerated 
classroom.  Other articles include: "How To Build Achievers" (Laura Hathaway); 
"A Mother's Joy, A Teacher's Reward" (Margaret Gosfield); "Musing on Parental 
Modeling" (Martha Flournoy); "Advocacy Notes" (Martha Flournoy); "Homeschool: 
Where Present and Future Meet" (Isabelle Nidever); "Resources for Parents: A 
GATE Reading List" (Jo Anne Viserta-Galinis); and "Mentoring: It's Not Just for 
Our Children " (Sue Benzinger).  (Most papers contain references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This book advances a philosophy of education and a vision of elementary 
schools as institutions that offer a solution that responds to the changing 
needs of today's families where schools become "schoolhomes" in which learning 
is animated by an ethic of social awareness.  Following an introduction that 
sketches the sweeping social changes since the 19th Century, chapter 1, "School 
and Home", describes the ideas of John Dewey and Maria Montessori and argues 
for an educational approach that brings the domestic and the educational 
together.  Chapter 2, "Culture and Curriculum," describes the challenge to the 
"homeschool" idea in a diverse and pluralistic society where no common culture 
binds students together.  Chapter 3, "Learning To Live," considers the 
different educational needs of boys and girls.  Chapter 4, "Domesticity 
Repressed," looks at the general rejection of home and domesticity in current 
cultures and argues that domesticity and concepts of family and home cannot be 
separated from educational institutions.  Chapter 5, "Home and World," argues 
for the role of education in changing the world rather then preparing students 
for the "real world." An epilogue, "The Here and Now," describes the 
accomplishments of actual schools and individuals implementing programs with 
"homeschool" approaches.  Included is a 146-item bibliography.  (JB)<BR>
