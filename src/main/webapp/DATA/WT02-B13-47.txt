The purpose of this conference is to explore the evidence to support

or disprove the hypothesis that:

<P>

&quot;The United States risks re-creating rural poverty through

immigration. This rural poverty may be even more difficult to

extirpate; since it requires overcoming language and education

barriers in an economy that penalizes with low earnings workers

without education and skills.&quot;<BR>


<P>

This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to

participate actively with researchers and local government officials

to discuss developments in these communities and what might be

done. Another conference is planned for Summer 1996.

<P>

A conference on Immigration and the Changing Face of Rural California

was held June 12-14 1995 in Asilomar, California, to explore whether

the United States is recreating rural poverty through immigration

in the 1990s. Asilomar was the first of what we hope will be a

series of conferences on immigration and integration issues and

prospects in rural California and rural America. <BR>


<P>

An agenda and the questions that guided the discussion are attached.

<BR>


<P>

The Asilomar conference brought together academic and policy researchers,

community leaders, and activists to consider how immigration is

affecting demographics, economies, and politics in communities

in two California regions: the San Joaquin Valley and the Central

Coast. Studies of rural communities constituted the core of the

conference program. Key findings and conclusions from this conference

should be useful in shaping policy and research agendas on impacts

of immigration in rural areas. <BR>


<P>

The key findings of the June 12-14 1995 conference in Asilomar,

California include:

<P>

1. The towns and cities in major agricultural regions of the state

are growing as a result of immigration and children born to immigrants.

This is evident in towns such as Parlier--two thirds of whose

residents were born abroad; and half of these immigrants arrived

in California after 1980.<BR>


<P>

2. These residents are often poor--from 25 to 50 percent of the

families in these towns have incomes below federal poverty levels,

and 7 of California's 10 poorest cities are &quot;overgrown labor

camps&quot; or farm worker towns [California has 450 cities].

<BR>


<P>

3. Poor immigrants do not affect the towns in which they settle

uniformly. For example, there is closer to a one-to-one relationship

between new residents and housing, and high ratios of new residents

have children in schools. But the correlation between immigration

and public assistance and welfare is lower-- although the rate

at which residents are requesting public assistance in these poor

rural communities is rising sharply.<BR>


<P>

4. Many of the effects of immigrant farm workers on local communities

occur with uncertain lags. Migration is a network phenomenon,

often begun by U.S. recruitment, sustained by poverty in rural

Mexico and jobs in rural California, and then &quot;managed&quot;

by family and village networks that effectively &quot;capture&quot;

desirable items in rural California--particular jobs, labor camps,

or schools--for immigrants from specific communities in Mexico.

<BR>


<P>

5. The economies and labor markets of rural communities are increasingly

layered or segmented in a manner that pushes many of the costs

of seasonal farm work onto the most flexible or absorptive people

present, recently-arrived immigrants. These immigrants, in turn,

are a market for settled local residents, including FLCs who organize

them into crews, those who provide newcomers with housing, meals,

rides to work, and check-cashing services, and those who provide

publicly-supported services to newcomers. Local residents are

usually paid for the services they received in cash, giving them

tax-free income.<BR>


<P>

6. The rural poverty being created through immigration is fundamentally

different from the rural poverty of the postwar south and midwest.

Today's rural poverty is being created via the immigration of

persons with low earnings and little education into an expanding

fruit and vegetable agriculture that increasingly exports the

commodities produced by immigrant farm workers. <BR>


<P>

During the 1950s, and 1960s, by contrast, there were a declining

number of jobs for U.S. citizen farmers and sharecroppers in a

consolidating and mechanizing agriculture. The solution in the

1950s and 1960s was a Great rural-urban Migration involving 1

million persons annually; it is not yet clear what the solution

for 1990s rural poverty will be.<BR>


<P>

7. Rural poverty affects California cities as local residents,

particularly the children of immigrants, seek a livelihood outside

of agriculture. The transfer of rural poverty to urban poverty

highlights the importance of education and training to improve

the prospects for California's rural-to-urban migrants in the

urban economy.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892834"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The idea for this conference emerged from two separate developments.

The first was a national shift in interest in the early 1990s

from immigration policy--how many, from where, and in what status

foreigners arrive--to immigrant or integration policy--what should

be done for immigrants after their arrival to ensure that they

and their children integrate successfully?<BR>


<P>

The second was a long-standing interest in farm labor market trends,

especially the role of seasonal harvest labor markets as a port

of entry for especially rural Mexican immigrants into the US.

<BR>


<P>

Three concerns provided the backdrop for the conference. 

<UL>

<LI>First, the public resources available to integrate newcomers

are declining even though the number of immigrants is increasing.

<LI>Second, seasonal farm work is done primarily by foreigners

who have recently arrived in the U.S. and who have few other U.S.

job options. 

<LI>Third, despite farm labor surpluses and a variety of factors

that combine to prevent immigrant farm workers from finding nonfarm

jobs, rural Mexicans continue to arrive in rural California, fueling

population growth and poverty. 

</UL>


<P>

In the past, immigration policy was integration policy in rural

America. Everyone &quot;knew&quot; that workers with other U.S.

job options would abandon seasonal farm work, so the U.S. government

permitted or tolerated the entry of new immigrants into the seasonal

farm labor market.

<P>

Conference participants are familiar with towns and cities in

the agricultural areas of California. They were asked to consider

a simple question with far-reaching socioeconomic ramifications:

Are we re-creating rural poverty through immigration? If rural

poverty is increasing, what is likely to happen to especially

poor rural residents and their children? Will they stay in rural

areas and accept the jobs available, will they receive education

and training and attract industries that transform rural economies,

will they rely on public assistance, or will they move?

<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892835"><FONT SIZE=4>Three Themes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Three themes run through the conference papers. 

<P>

First, there is no end in sight to the current wave of immigrants.

This gives rise to a potential contradiction between immigration

and integration policies. There is widespread agreement that the

children of farm workers raised and educated in the U.S. avoid

seasonal farm work, so that, under current conditions, seasonal

farm workers do not reproduce themselves in the U.S. <BR>


<P>

This makes integration a Sisyphean task, a never-ending quest

to undo the poverty that often results from seasonal farm work.

Farmers will continue to ensure that newly-arrived seasonal farm

workers are available, and communities and assistance programs

will continue to strive to provide them and their children with

the education needed for nonfarm jobs. In theory, this should

cause tension between farm employers who rely on immigrant workers

and efforts to integrate these workers into better-paying jobs.

However, it does not, largely because successful integration efforts

that encourage and permit farm worker children to find nonfarm

jobs reinforce growers' assertions that U.S. workers won't do

farm work, so the only option is to import new workers from abroad,

setting in motion another cycle of escape from the farm labor

market.

<P>

Second, it is clear the number of needy people in the towns and

cities surrounding the state's farms has increased faster than

the number of people on public assistance. Unlike the 1 to 1 relationship

between child population growth and school enrollment, the rate

at which poor people apply for and receive public assistance in

rural areas is slower than the rate at which their numbers are

increasing. <BR>


<P>

This raises the question of whether the gap between need and public

assistance simply is a reflection of knowledge and legal obstacles,

or whether it represents a behavioral difference; i.e., are private

networks filling assistance needs in rural areas privately, so

that only education needs are publicly visible. A question of

significant public policy import is whether the gap between need

and public assistance in rural America is a short-term or long-term

phenomenon.

<P>

Third, the binational labor market is so well established between

rural Mexico and rural California that the U.S. must take an interest

in rural Mexico. Failure to promote rural development in Mexico

will inevitably lead to the need to launch rural development efforts

in the U.S to integrate the rural Mexicans who move here. 

<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892836"><FONT SIZE=4>Immigration Patterns

and Immigrant Policies</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H1>


<P>

There are many models of immigrant effects on local populations

and economies. Two models mark the extremes. One argues that there

are economies of scale and multiplier effects of immigrant workers,

so that the arrival of immigrants increases local economic activity

and creates or preserves good jobs for local residents. <BR>


<P>

The other extreme argues that immigrants take over local jobs

and freeze low wages into place, so that the continued arrival

of unskilled immigrants transforms the economy into something

resembling the migrants' place of origin, and local workers who

would have to compete with immigrants tend to migrate away. This

gives rise to the so-called import-third-world-immigrants-and-get-third-world-conditions

syndrome.<BR>


<P>

An analysis of census-tract data from 12 agricultural counties

in central California suggest that immigrants represent a two-edged

sword for rural California. One the one hand, their labor is critical

to an expanding labor-intensive agricultural sector. On the other

hand, immigration into rural communities is associated with rising

poverty, public assistance, and underemployment rates. <BR>


<P>

Influxes of low-skilled immigrant workers may release human-resource

constraints and create income linkages promoting local income

growth, as suggested by the optimistic model. However, the benefits

of this income growth are unevenly distributed. Low wages and

high unemployment rates are endemic at the bottom end of the job

ladder, where most immigrants to rural California are concentrated,

as suggested by the pessimistic view. <BR>


<P>

The combination of growth-promoting immigration and a broad base

of jobs with limited earnings prospects leads to the seemingly

paradoxical outcome of a positive association between immigration

and income growth, but also a correlation between immigration

and poverty growth.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892837"><FONT SIZE=4>Migration Networks</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Migration networks have evolved to assure U.S. farms a reliable

supply of low-skill immigrant labor. Mexican immigrants have traditionally

come from 6 western Mexican states centered around Guadalajara.

These states include almost 20 percent of Mexico's population.

<BR>


<P>

Increasingly, networks of family contacts take migrants from these

states to urban rather than agricultural U.S. jobs. The &quot;new-new&quot;

migrants in California agriculture are primarily from the 3 southwestern

states in Mexico, which include about 10 percent of Mexico's population

but large concentrations of Mexico's poor people. <BR>


<P>

Unlike migrants from western Mexico, who were recruited under

the Bracero program to work in U.S. agriculture, Mixtecs from

Oaxaca became U.S. migrants in a stage process that began with

growers in Sinaloa and Baja California who recruited them to travel

to northern Mexico, and then U.S. recruiters encouraged them to

migrate across the border.

<P>

As the newest arrivals, Mixtecs are at the bottom of the agricultural

job ladder. However, unlike migrants from western Mexico who waited

until they had found more-or-less permanent tractor driver or

irrigator jobs to unify their families in the U.S., some Mixtecs

believe a series of seasonal jobs provides sufficient stability

to justify family unification in the U.S.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892838"><FONT SIZE=4>Colonias in The Central

Valley</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H1>


<P>

California has about 450 cities, and an analysis of 120 of them

found that colonias--mostly Hispanic towns and cities--are replacing

barrios, cities with a section in which Hispanics are concentrated.

Across these colonias, indicators of low earnings and poverty

increased between 1980 and 1990--the percent of the population

with below poverty level earnings increased from 15 to 20 percent,

while the percent of adults without a high school diploma rose

from 50 to 54 percent.<BR>


<P>

Studies of colonias reveal a challenging problem in evaluating

the costs and benefits of immigration in rural California: the

major beneficiaries of immigration tend to live outside the communities

that bear the costs of servicing the needs of large numbers of

low-skilled immigrant farm workers with poor earnings and unstable

employment. This means that studies of individual colonias can

lead to a pessimistic view of immigration's impacts. <BR>


<P>

Labor-intensive agriculture, by drawing large numbers of workers

from abroad and offering many of them only poverty-level earnings

and employment, creates a negative externality for these rural

communities, i.e., the cost of meeting the public service needs

of farm workers whose paychecks cannot support them.<BR>


<P>

The demographic and economic trends identified by the &quot;macro&quot;

studies typically are magnified in individual &quot;micro&quot;

community case studies. Seven studies presented at the conference

provide a starting point for piecing together a picture of how

immigration is reshaping rural California communities.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892839"><FONT SIZE=4>Parlier</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H2>


<P>

Parlier is a city of 10,000 about 20 miles southeast of Fresno.

It is over 97 percent Hispanic. Its history illustrates the demographic

transition occurring in rural California. It was 95 percent non-Hispanic

white in 1921 and 70 percent Hispanic in 1970. In 1972, after

schooling and police disputes, Hispanics replaced Whites on the

city council.<BR>


<P>

Grapes and tree fruits dominate the agriculture around Parlier,

and the nature of seasonal labor needs in these commodities has

led in most cases to a three-tiered labor force-- a few year-round

workers (1/7), more long-season local workers (1/5), and mostly

peak season migrants (2/3). This means that the job pyramid in

local agriculture is narrow at the top.<BR>


<P>

Parlier's economy has long been based on serving farm workers,

including those employed in nonfarm but ag-related industries

such as packing and processing. Like many other cities in rural

California, Parlier grew rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s as

farmers eliminated on-farm housing for workers. The city constructed

low-income housing to help fill the housing gap. However, Parlier

is now on a housing treadmill. As new migrants continue to arrive,

established residents rent out their garages and backyards, and

a constant or higher percentage of the city's residents wind up

in poor housing. <BR>


<P>

Provision of services like housing, job contracting, transportation

and food to a large seasonal influx of farm workers creates some

income and employment for established residents, in a manner analogous

to a tourist town. However, the poverty-level earnings of most

farm workers severely limits incomes in these immigrant service

activities. The best local jobs are held by those who use public

funds to provide education, health, and other public services

to farm workers.<BR>


<P>

A high percentage of Parlier residents is poor, but relatively

few receive public assistance. Public assistance in Parlier seems

to go to poor people who have an attachment to the labor force,

in contrast to the nearby city of Fresno where a higher percentage

of recipients seem to receive aid for long periods. Legal obstacles

to immigrants obtaining public assistance, together with strong

network support among immigrants, probably help explain these

differences. The state-run migrant camp--reportedly isolated from

the city despite being inside city limits--houses workers who

spend 6 months each year in south Texas or Mexico. The children

of camp workers sometimes follow their parents to the fields.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892840"><FONT SIZE=4>Madera</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H2>


<P>

Madera county has about 100,000 residents, about one-third of

whom are Hispanic. Raisin grapes and other commodities in the

county have long relied on seasonal Mestizo workers from the western

Mexican state of Michoacan but, since the mid-1980s, Mixtec Indians

from Oaxaca have become the major entry-level workers. <BR>


<P>

This ethnic succession raises interesting questions, including

whether or not the Mixtecs arriving in Madera in the 1990s can

expect to achieve the same upward mobility achieved by previous

farm workers from Michoacan, who replaced white farm workers in

an expanding labor intensive agriculture. Immigrants currently

are experiencing falling earnings relative to whites, and there

is evidence of rising competition between established Mestizo

and burgeoning Mixtec migration networks for more desirable, year-round

jobs.

<P>

Madera illustrates the dilemma inherent in managing seasonal labor

in rural California. Most residents pay at least lip service to

the notion that education should be improved so that farm worker

children are not &quot;trapped&quot; in poverty. But the same

educational opportunities that prepare farm worker children for

nonfarm jobs ensure that they will not be seasonal farm workers

themselves, putting the county on an immigrant farm worker treadmill

in which new groups of immigrants are encouraged to fill seasonal

job vacancies, and the community struggles to ensure that their

children can achieve the better life to which they aspire.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892841"><FONT SIZE=4>Famersville and McFarland</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H2>


<P>

Famersville and McFarland are towns of about 7000 residents each

in which half of the labor force are farm or food processing workers,

prompting them to be labeled by some as &quot;incorporated labor

camps.&quot; In both cities, there are relatively few businesses,

and they have low sales, so that there are low sales tax and public

revenues. <BR>


<P>

These communities represent a striking juxtaposition of concentrated

rural poverty amidst a prosperous agriculture. Rising poverty

in the two towns is associated with an oversupply of immigrant

workers and displacement of local workers (mostly older immigrants)

by new immigrant groups from southern Mexico. Here, as in Parlier,

settled residents provide low-cost services to farm workers. Higher

income groups have moved outside the communities.<BR>


<P>

The farm workers in Farmersville and McFarland appear to be unifying

their families in California. A combination of factors--legal

status, U.S. wages and benefits including unemployment benefits,

and the sense that there is little economic future in rural Mexico--help

to explain why rural Mexican migrants increasingly are becoming

residents of cities in the agricultural areas of California.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892842"><FONT SIZE=4>Fresno: the Rural-Urban

Connection</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H2>


<P>

Two things flow out of small rural towns into the rapidly expanding

cities of California's central valley: second-generation immigrants,

and large business. Cities are a magnet for sons and daughters

of immigrant farm workers who do not see a future for themselves

doing farm work. <BR>


<P>

Conference participants also provided numerous examples of &quot;Main

Streets&quot; of rural communities shutting down, as local residents

turn to regional shopping centers to be their primary suppliers

of goods. Only businesses providing goods and services not easily

traded across the distances separating rural residents from the

closest urban area remain, leaving a string of empty store fronts

in the downtowns of rural communities.<BR>


<P>

Fresno county dominates the demographic and economic landscape

of the Central Valley. Fresno county has annual agricultural commodity

sales of $3 billion, about one-sixth of the CA total, and more

than the farm sales of states such as New York and South Dakota.

The county had about 670,000 residents in 1990, about 60 percent

of whom lived in the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area. <BR>


<P>

By 1995, the county's population is estimated to be almost 800,000,

with half in the city of Fresno, one-quarter in 14 incorporated

cities, and one-quarter in the rest of the county. Fresno-Clovis

is a predominantly non-Hispanic white city, while the percentage

of Hispanics in cities such as Mendota, Huron, and Parlier tops

90 percent.<BR>


<P>

Non-Hispanic whites are the oldest residents, so that, e.g., the

Hispanic and Asian percentage of the city&iacute;s school enrollment

is greater than their percentage of the city&iacute;s population.

One third of the county&iacute;s population is younger than 18.

<BR>


<P>

There are about 300,000 employed persons in the county, including

20 percent in agriculture and 10 percent in manufacturing. County

wide, 90 percent of total employment is in 5 sectors--trade, services,

and government each have 20 percent. The average annual unemployment

rate was 14 percent in 1992-93.<BR>


<P>

Fresno county has a relatively low-wage economy, largely because

of the importance of low-wage agriculture in the economy and the

fact that about 2/3 of the manufacturing jobs are in non-durables.

The percentage of Fresno county&iacute;s population with less-than-poverty

level incomes jumped between 1980 and 1990. About 30 percent of

the county&iacute;s residents received public assistance near

the end of 1993. Rates of public assistance varied by race/ethnicity--about

10 percent for non-Hispanic whites, versus almost 40 percent for

Hispanics, and over 60 percent of Blacks.<BR>


<P>

Surveys of farm workers, many of whom are SAWs, suggest that most

want nonfarm jobs, but lack of English and skills keep them in

the farm work force. Most do not learn English, or live in areas

and work in situations in which they need to learn English. Farm

workers with children often rely on them to translate for them.

<BR>


<P>

It appears that most first generation immigrant farm worker do

not have an opportunity to learn English. Their children do, and

they develop both aspirations for nonfarm jobs and rights to public

assistance. The race in Fresno county is to determine whether

the nonfarm jobs in the area, public assistance, or migration

away from Fresno will prove more attractive to the immigrant children

of farm workers.

Guadalupe and Shandon </FONT></H1>


<P>

Guadalupe is a city of 6000 in Santa Barbara county that that

has long relied on Mexican immigrant workers. The argument made

about Guadalupe is that the nature of agricultural production

produces poverty, not continuing immigration. However, labor-intensive

agriculture may not have expanded in the area without the availability

of flexible immigrant workers.<BR>


<P>

Shandon is another farm worker town of 700 that switched from

cattle and grains to producing more labor-intensive crops, especially

grapes. As the number of seasonal farm workers increased, so did

the number of newly-arrived immigrant Hispanics, who were visible

in the small town--Hispanics are about one-third of the town's

population. Crowding in substandard housing led to visibility

and conflict with local residents, especially those who were not

dependent on seasonal Mexican immigrant workers. Eventually, farm

workers were dispersed to less visible locations outside the town.

<BR>


<P>

It is important to emphasize that California, which has a proportionately

small rural or nonmetro population, is experiencing rapid population

growth in the towns and cities in major farming areas, so that

farm evolution is not associated with population decline in surrounding

communities in California, as it is in the midwest. <BR>


<P>

Second, in the race between mechanization and the expansion of

agricultural production, the net number of seasonal farm jobs

seems to be stable, at least at the state level, which means that

there are more jobs for seasonal workers in some parts of the

state. Third, an apparently vibrant and expanding agricultural

industry is associated with more visible poverty among farm workers.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892844"><FONT SIZE=5>Policy Alternatives</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

U.S. history is in part the story of how agriculture dealt with

the need for seasonal farm workers in a nation that offered enough

nonfarm opportunities that it was very hard to maintain a work

force willing to accommodate itself to the needs of seasonal agriculture.

Over the last 150 years, the seasonal work force evolved from

a mix of slaves, families of farm workers, and seasonal hired

hands to mostly hired workers. The seasonal hired farm labor market,

in turn, has developed institutions that turn many of the costs

associated with low seasonal earnings over to workers themselves--and

to the communities that house them.

<P>

For example, lower-than-average farm wages, it was once argued,

were offset in part by employer-provided housing and other in-kind

benefits. But across the United States, the story of the 1980s

and 1990s is that employer-provided benefits are shrinking and

wages are not rising in compensation, so effective real farm worker

earnings are shrinking. This makes seasonal farm jobs less attractive

to workers with other options, and ensures that only the newest

and most desperate immigrants are eager for seasonal jobs.

<P>

Increasing socio-economic distance between farmers and workers

only compounds the isolation of the farm labor market. With farmers

dealing more and more with farm labor contractor (FLC) middlemen

who compete for their farm work on the basis of cost, farmers

know less and less about &quot;their workers,&quot; and take less

responsibility for them. Laws that seek to force growers to take

more responsibility for seasonal workers generally include loopholes

and, in any event, are not uniformly enforced. One advantage to

farmers of employing labor through FLCs is that the FLCs seem

to be able to avoid effective labor and tax law enforcement.

<P>

Changes in the farm labor market make it unlikely that immigrant

farm workers and their children will achieve upward mobility there.

Several conference participants proposed a combination of efforts

to slow immigration, training second-generation immigrants to

compete in urban labor markets, and developing nonagricultural

employment in rural and urban areas to provide workers with alternatives

to low-paying seasonal farm work. <BR>


<P>

However, solutions like these lead to the policy dilemma of how

to encourage mobility of immigrant farm workers and their children

while at the same time guaranteeing a supply of labor to fill

seasonal farm jobs. California's prosperous agriculture is a revolving-door

employer of new immigrants, and attempts to integrate new immigrants

into the U.S. economy speed up the revolving door. In the process,

poverty continues to be transferred from rural Mexico to rural

California through immigration, and then into urban California,

through the migration of farm workers and their children out of

agriculture.

<P>

There are no easy alternatives to revolving door farm worker poverty.

One option would be to push up farm wages, either by reducing

immigration, by raising minimum wages and enforcing labor laws,

or through collective bargaining. The supply of US workers should

increase as a result--perhaps as workers revolve through the farm

labor market slower--and the demand should drop significantly,

as farmers use labor more efficiently, mechanize, and change crops.

<BR>


<P>

A second alternative is to argue that the farm labor market should

be maintained as it is, but that seasonal farm workers should

be guest workers who do not earn the right to stay in the US.

In this manner, the revolving door would operate to and from rural

Mexico, rather than from rural Mexico to rural California and

rural America. <BR>

<CENTER><B>Conference Questions and Guidelines<BR>

</B></CENTER>

<P>

This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to

participate actively with researchers and local government officials

to discuss developments in these communities and what might be

done. A conference to discuss the policy implications of the rural

community studies presented at this conference is planned for

1997 in Washington DC.<BR>


<P>

<B>Community Studies Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

1. What are the major issues--pluses and minuses--associated with

high rates of immigration--adding one percent or more to the population

every year via immigration, or doubling the population of the

community when seasonal workers arrive? How would these issues

be affected if the inflow of new immigrants were stopped or significantly

reduced into your community, the aim of current border control

efforts and immigration reform legislation?<BR>


<P>

2. There is no generally accepted definition of immigrant integration.

However, when two or more distinct groups share a geographic area,

two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration

or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,

encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism

or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging

the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming

ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting

pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.

<BR>


<P>

Which type of integration is occurring in your community/region?

Why? What are the major factors affecting integration in this

community/region, e.g., jobs, housing, schooling, governance?

What public policies are most important in regulating the speed

and extent of integration in your community/region, e.g., housing

for families, jobs for adults, or education for children?<BR>


<P>

3. Many newly-arrived immigrants find jobs with the help of ethnic

networks. Do immigrant networks in rural communities confine immigrants

to low-wage jobs, or give them a hand up the job ladder? Some

have speculated that rural communities are distinguished from

immigrant cities such as Los Angeles--where immigrants are concentrated

at the top and the bottom of the skill and earnings distribution--because,

in rural areas, the top or the role models are missing--there

is a pyramid-shaped distribution of skills and earnings, i.e.,

a wide base of low-skill people and jobs that tapers off abruptly.

Is this true in your community/region?<BR>


<P>

4. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization

and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would

decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the

eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect

immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>


<P>

<B>Policy Implications Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

1. Are there any particular communities/regions or public or private

policies that stand out in promoting successful integration, or

in impeding immigrant integration? What are the communities that

currently have a majority of foreign-born residents, and continue

to grow by one to five percent per year via immigration, likely

to look like in 10 years if current trends continue, i.e., are

current immigration patterns sustainable?<BR>


<P>

2. What seems to be the most variable affecting the success of

integration--number of immigrants, characteristics of migrants,

situation and attitudes of the community in which they settle,

or some combination of these? What does this variable suggest

about prioritizing government efforts to accelerate integration

in immigrant communities in agricultural areas--should housing,

jobs, education, crime etc.-- be tackled first, and why? <BR>


<OL>

<LI>Federal and state governments are considering decentralization

and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would

decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the

eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect
