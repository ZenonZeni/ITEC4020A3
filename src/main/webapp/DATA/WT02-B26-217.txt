<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Encroachment of saline water into fresh water aquifers on the Louisiana Gulf Coast has traditionally been attributed to surface processes.  Hurricanes, rising sea levels, and the dredging of deepwater canals have been seen as the lateral transport mechanisms of getting salt water into the interior of these wetlands.  However, a vertical transport mechanism has been identified · upward, periodic release of saline fluids from deep aquifers to shallow aquifers along regional growth faults.  This vertical transport mechanism has important ramifications to the petroleum, gas, transportation, and other sectors that have an investment in infrastructure that could suffer from increased subsidence accompanying these faults.

A more exact knowledge of active subsidence areas, which are not apparent from the marsh surface, would benefit all interested parties in the region.  Pipelines, bridges, and roads could be located in more stable areas.  An oil production company might be able to demonstrate, during litigation, that natural processes caused local subsidence, not its drilling activity.  And petroleum geologists might better understand the role of faulting in the migration of hydrocarbons beneath these and similar delta terranes.

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Differences in chloride concentrations have been determined in aquifers straddling a known fault zone (the Baton Rouge Fault).  These findings support the theory that saline waters are fed into fresh marsh terranes from deep, geopressured zones and that these terranes and associated waters are compartmentalized into blocks.  Additional support for fault compartmentalization came from deep research boreholes, surface vegetation mapping, satellite imagery, and other sources.  Argonne research staff utilized an extensive database of existing seismic records to map the location where faults intersect with the surface.  The team proceeded under the assumption that these faults and fault-bound compartments were hydrologically distinct and could be mapped with non-invasive electromagnetic technology.
<P>
In November 1994, Argonne research staff made a reconnaissance trip to southern Louisiana to determine if an electromagnetic sounding technique could map salinity regimes compartmentalized by faults.  Results indicated that the hydrology of these wetlands is much more complicated than the simple diffusion model endorsed by the U.S. Geological Survey.
<P>
Electromagnetics is a non-invasive, inexpensive method for gathering framework data in these wetlands.  Bulk conductivity represents a cumulative electromagnetic response from the surface to the effective depth of the tool.  In this case, the effective depths of response were 15, 30, and 60 meters.  The study indicated that the deep 60-meter values best defined the aquifers on each side of the fault.  Investigations up to 600 meters in depth are possible with time domain electromagnetics (TDEM).

<B>Results</B>
<P>
A Ph.D. dissertation and several publications by an Argonne staff member have focused on the relationship of seismically mapped faults to subsidence phenomena in southern Louisiana.  The followup investigation demonstrated the ability of electromagnetics techniques to map these same faults.
<P>
The electromagnetic technique used by Argonne is simple to apply.  A preliminary hydrogeologic investigation across two parishes was accomplished in a week.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
A work proposal is being prepared to continue these investigations down to 600 meters by using TDEM.  Several strategically placed deep borings will be used to field calibrate the TDEM data set.
