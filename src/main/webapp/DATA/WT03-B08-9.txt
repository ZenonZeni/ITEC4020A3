RETROACTIVE SENIORITY AS REDRESS
Beame v DeLeon, _ NY2d _

State and municipal human rights agencies have "broad remedial
powers" according to the ruling by New York State's Court of
Appeals in Beame v DeLeon. These powers allow the agency to award
retroactive seniority to persons found to have been victims of
unlawful discrimination, notwithstanding provisions in the
State's Civil Service Law to the contrary.

The case involved the treatment of women in the New York City
Police Department. The New York City Human Rights Commission had
found that the Department had "engaged in a pattern of unlawful
discrimination against women."

Unlawful acts by the Department included (1) establishing
employment quotas that limited the number of women who could be
appointed to less than 2 percent of the police force; (2)
discriminatory layoff policies that resulted in more than half
the women being laid off during a financial crisis in 1976 while
only 10 percent of the male police officers were laid off; (3)
mandatory assignment of women police officers as matrons; and (4)
restricting the number of precincts to which women could be
assigned.
The Human Rights Commission awarded 43 complainants retroactive
seniority for pension and other purposes, together with $533,000
collectively in compensatory damages for mental anguish.
Complaints filed by an additional 38 active and former
policewomen are pending before the Commission.

The Court said that the Legislature had granted broad remedial
powers to state and municipal human rights agencies to counteract
the impact of past discrimination in employment. According, the
Court ruled that "under these circumstances [there is] no doubt
that a resolution which may somewhat subordinate the discretion
of the appointing authority to the complainants' rights to
remediation for the discriminatory practices of that authority is
more consistent with legislative intent."

Upholding the authority of the Division to award retroactive
seniority as redress for unlawful discrimination, the Court
distinguished this remedy from the limitations place on the
Division's directing the appointment of an individual.  The Court
of Appeals referred to its decision in City of Schenectady v
State Div. of Human Rights, 37 NY2d 42l.

In the Schenectady case the Court ruled that allowing the
Division to order the appointment of an otherwise qualified
individual would impinge on the discretion of the statutory
authority appointing authority to make an appointment, citing Section 61
of the Civil Service Law. It found no similar prohibition in the
granting of retroactive seniority equal to the seniority the
individual would have enjoyed but for the discriminatory act.

SEXUAL ORIENTATION
Proposed Employment Non-discrimination Act, S-932; HR-1863

Pending before the 104th  Congress is the Employment Non-
Discrimination Act [Senate 932; House of Representatives 1863].
The bill would prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the
basis of sexual orientation. According to sponsors, The
Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995 (ENDA)  is intended to
ensure fair employment practices -- not special rights -- for
lesbians, gay men and bisexuals. According to Sen. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), one of 150 co-sponsors, it is now legal in 42 states
to fire someone based on sexual orientation.

Under ENDA, covered entities cannot subject an individual to
different standards or treatment based on that individual's
sexual orientation, or discriminate against an individual based
on the sexual orientation of those with whom the individual
associates.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The `disparate impact' claim available under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) is not available
under ENDA. Therefore, an employer is not required to justify a
neutral practice that may have a statistically disparate impact
based on sexual orientation.

ENDA does not apply to employers with fewer than fifteen
employees. It also exempts religious organizations, educational
institutions substantially controlled or supported by religious
organizations, and the military.

ENDA prohibits preferential treatment, including quotas, based on
sexual orientation. It does not require an employer to provide
benefits for the same-sex partner of an employee.

EDITOR'S NOTE: ENDA provides for the same remedies (injunctive
relief and damages) as are permitted under Title
VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

The act applies to Congress, with the same remedies as provided
by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. ENDA would not
be retroactive.

For full text of the bill and comments that have appeared in the
Congressional Record, see the affirmative action page on NYPER's
home page. The address is:

PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION
Quarantino v Tiffany & Company, CA2, 94-9268

Tiffany & Company abolished the position held by Mary C.
Quarantino while she was on maternity leave "as part of a
corporate reorganization." Tiffany offered Quarantino a lower
level position, which she accepted. By accepting the lower level
position, however, Quarantino lost salary, stock options and
retirement credits.

After filing a complaint with EEOC, Quarantino learned that
Tiffany had hired a "non-pregnant, unmarried woman" to perform
what she claims were essentially the same duties that she had
performed in her former position. She sued, claiming that
Tiffany's action constituted unlawful pregnancy discrimination
under Title VII.

Quarantino also alleged that although a superior, Michael Eiring,
advised that "her job would be waiting for her" when she was
ready to return to work, he also told her that "a mother should
stay home with her child." In addition, Quarantino said that she
learned that Tiffany commenced recruiting for the new position
before she left on maternity leave. She also contended that two
other women had experience work problems when they returned from
their maternity leaves.

A District Court judge ruled that Quarantino had not established
a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination and dismissed her
claim. The Circuit Court of Appeals [Second Circuit] reverse. In
reinstating her complaint, the Circuit Court said that a trial
was required because Quarantino raised a number of disputed
issues, such as the question of the "new position" created being
the equivalent of her former position and the selection of a
single woman to fill it.

The Court suggested that if Quarantino could prove such to be the
case, it might constitute evidence of Tiffany's alleged
"discriminatory animus" towards pregnant employees. Presumably
the matter will now be schedule for jury trial before a district
court judge.

HAIR LENGTH POLICY DISCRIMINATORY
Rourke v NYS Dept. of Correctional Serv., USDC NDNY 94-CV-0735

A federal district court judge ruled that the New York State
Department of Correctional Services' refusal to grant a Mohawk
Indian an exemption from its uniform hair length policy
constituted unlawful religious discrimination.

Raymond T. Rourke, a Mohawk Indian, was fired from his position
as a correction officer because he refused to cut his hair to
conform to department rules concerning hair length which required
hair to be not more than one-half inch below the top of their
shirt collar.

Rourke, who was initially appointed as a prison guard in 1989,
stopped cutting his hair in 1991 when he joined the Mohawk's
traditional Longhouse faith. He said that he discontinued the
practice of haircuts as a sign of his spirituality and religious
commitment.

Initially allowed to wear his uncut hair in a ponytail, a new
superior officer directed Rourke to confirm to the Department's
hair length policy. Although women corrections personnel may have
hair of any length and are allowed to "pin it up" during working
hours, Rourke's offer to do this was rejected. Ultimately he was
dismissed for refusing to obey an order to comply with the hair
length policy.

Rourke sued in State Court and won reinstatement. Unemployed for
two years before being reinstated, Rourke sued in federal court
to obtain punitive or compensatory damages for emotional trauma,
a remedy not available in his State action. The federal district
Court, noting that New York State's Appellate Division had
earlier decided that the State failed to demonstrate any
"legitimate state interest that would be advanced" by
accommodating Rourke's request to be exempted from the
Department's hair length policy, found the Department's action
violated Title VII and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
1993.

The district court's ruling specifically notes that the Appellate
Division already concluded that "the State had no legitimate
interest ... since the very language of the [policy] provides for
an alternative to wearing hair beyond one-half inch below the
collar for female correction officers...."

FORMER EMPLOYEES AND TITLE VII
Robinson v Shell Oil Co., CA4, 93-1562

The term "employee" in Section 704(a) of Title VII has been held to
include a former employee who files Title VII allegations that he
or she was subjected to unlawful discrimination while an
employee. Section 704(a) also makes it unlawful for an employer to
retaliate against an employee because he or she filed charges
alleging unlawful discrimination or assisted others in filing a
complaint claiming Title VII violations. A former employee,
however, may not be able to bring a Title VII action based on
allegations of retaliatory actions by his or her former employer
in some circumstances.

In Robinson v Shell Oil Co., a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed a district court's dismissal of a Title VII action
charging that Shell Oil had given a former employee a "bad
reference" in retaliation for his filing a Title VII complaint
against Shell. Robinson, claiming that Shell had fired him
because of his race, filed a Title VII complaint. Robinson then
applied for a job with another company while his charges against
Shell were still pending.

Robinson's prospective employer contacted Shell for a reference.
When Robinson didn't get the job he applied for, he filed a
complaint contending that Shell had given him a negative
reference in retaliation for his having filed Title VII charges
against the company.

The Court decided that Title VII's definition of "employee"  does
not include former employees where the charges of alleged
discriminatory actions, including alleged retaliation, involved
events that occurred after the individual stopped working for the
former employer.

AGE DISCRIMINATION
Fitzpatrick v Town of Huntington, USDC, EDNY, Civ 93-2670

Joseph Fitzpatrick sued the Town of Huntington, N.Y. contending
that it had unlawfully discriminated against him because of his
age. Fitzpatrick was initially appointed as a temporary employee
in 1986 at the age of 51. Six years later he was terminated.

Fitzpatrick claimed that 61 temporary workers were permanently
appointed to positions with the Town during the six period during
which he was an employee. Of the 61, 60 were younger than
Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick argued that he was denied permanent
appointment simply because of his age.

A jury found the Town had unlawfully discriminated against
Fitzpatrick because of his age. It awarded him $187,500. Because
the jury found that Huntington's violation was willful, the
federal district court judge is permitted to double the award for
damages.
