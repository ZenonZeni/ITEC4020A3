Greg Perry with the Sol Survivor III team told me about their first day drive.
I saw them at one point and thought they might be having problems since they
were not moving very fast.  But Greg pointed out that since the car has
climbed Mount Washington, the hills on the route were no problem.  In fact,
what was going on was they were budgeting their energy very carefully since
this was the longest route the car has ever driven.  They made it all the way
through the route.<p>

Number 72 is Sungo from New Hampshire Technical Institute and is back for (at
least) the third year.  Spencer Allen explained that this year the wiring has
been improved, a new steering box has improved the handling, fixed problems
they had had with their solar panel and added new instrumentation, and up
graded the batteries up to 120 Volts.  Sungo is the only car this year with
separate motors for each of the rear wheels, each with a separate controller.
The brushless DC motors from Solectria have an electronic differential to keep
the rear wheels coordinated when under way.  The controllers also have a
low/high torque switch, which changes the motor wiring from wye to delta.
They claim the car has 100+ mile range, 75 mph top speed, carries two people +
200 pounds of luggage, has a 96 Watt solar array and 10 Trojan 27TMH deep-
cycle marine batteries with 9600 Watt-hour capacity.  It weighs 1365 pounds.<p>

        They won the efficiency award for the Discovery Commuter class one day
at 9 miles per kiloWatt-hour.<p>

Sunpacer from Cato-Meridian High School in Cato NY is number 92, back for the
3rd or 4th year.  According to Kevin Malda, this year it has new solar cells,
and a cleaned up electrical system.  They experimented with regenerative
braking but it was not operational at the start of the race.  The system is 32
Volt system of Deka Dominator batteries driving a 6 HP series Advanced DC
motor through a Sevcon controller.<p>

Mellisa Downs with the Darmouth Ecovox team explained what caused the ground
fault that caused difficulties during pre-race testing.  It was in the 12 Volt
system, which is not as big a deal as when it is in the traction system, and
rewiring the 12 Volt driver's meter so that the grounds were isolated fixed
the problem.  Mellisa worked on putting the batteries in, installing the
ethanol tank, and the fire extinguisher system.<p>

Mike Fabio (no relation) is with the Electric Hare built by the Falmouth
Wattsmen from Falmouth ME.  The first day they milked the car into the finish
line because the had trouble charging.  Their K&W transformerless charger has
very spikey waveforms that kept tripping the circuit breakers.   A fix was to
lower the charging rate to about 10% of the maximum rate, which leaves them
undercharged for the race, and worried.<p>

        The vehicle is a Volkswagon Rabbit converted with the kit from Electro
Automotive, and one that is very neatly done.  The 21 kWh batteries are from
US Battery, the motor from Advanced DC, and the Controller from Curtis.  (And
Mr. Gigi does their hair.)  The conversion is very, very clean and these guys
were the hit of Portland ME, showing up on the local TV shouting, "Now we're
going to Disney World!."<p>

Project e-, the propane fueled hybrid S-10 conversion, had a problem on the
first day because the had a valve leak that caused them to run out of fuel,
although it did not prevent them from finishing.<p>

        I had forgotten to ask earlier if, when they added the generator, did
they remove any of the batteries.  After all, that is one of the motivations
for using the engine driven generator; you can get by on fewer batteries.
Rachele Batacchi said that they kept all the batteries they had in their non-
hybrid version.  This proved useful here because they were able to run 16
miles just on the batteries.  The team is also plugging in each night, so the
fuel is used strictly for range extension.<p>

At least a couple of people took the scenic route the first day (read "got
lost").  I know that Genesis I missed a turn, and Hopper EV decided to visit
the Interstate 84, which took him 11 miles out of the way.  (The race
generally avoids the interstates, toll roads, and other high-speed roads.  The
40 mph minimum speed on such roads precludes many of the solar racers from
using them.  Hopper EV had no problem there.)<p>

Hopper EV had a more serious problem.  For some reason, not well understood,
it blew 3(!) chargers at the end of Day 1.  The guess was that there was some
kind of feedback coming from the controller that was interacting badly with
the charger.  By disconnecting the controller and rebuilding one of the
chargers Tom Hopper was able to get a charge and run the Day 2 leg late, but
with no difficulty.<p>

Number 53, the Elfa Electra, turned in very good performance.  Thomas Faul was
expecting a 50 mile range and first day they managed 69 miles with no problem.<p>

Dr. Fred Whitridge is a self-made man.  He holds an honorary doctorate that he
bestowed upon himself, as a gag "to keep the NESEA people from going to crazy
with thier beaurocracy and their rules.  For example, rule 12.1.6 says you
shall carry electrolyte neutralizer at all times.  So Dr. Fred and his partner
Dr. Rob have been wearing a box of Arm and Hammer baking soda on their arm
everywhere they go, figuring they will the only ones left in the race because
all the other teams only have their baking soda in the car and will hence be
disqualified.  When not racing, Fred is an investor in Greenwich CT.<p>

        Fred's car is number 60, the Millenium Falcon, by the Blue Sky Club, a
group from the Yale School of Management class of 1983 that have worked
together on a number of projects, some gags, some real that try to address
some societal concern such as pollution.  The car is a 1985 Volkswagon
Cabriolet that at 97,000 miles was blowing a lot of oil.  "My 8-year-old and I
did the conversion, starting with Mike Brown's (Electro Automotive) kit, which
has been modified almost beyond recognition."  It uses an 8-inch Advanced DC
motor, Curtis 1221B ("no problems when mounted on a 2-inch heat sink with a
fan"), and a 96 Volt pack of Trojan T145s, with a trailer added just for the
race holding an additional 24 Volts.  It also has a radio and a heater.<p>

        The car was finished in May, 1994, and is used for daily commuting.
It accumulated 3800 miles in that year.<p>

        Fred told a story where he went away on business and called home to
see how things were going.  When he asked his 8-year-old what he had been
doing, he said, "driving around in the electric car."<p>

        "You and who?"<p>

        "Me and Mom."<p>

        "But Mom doesn't know how to drive the electric car."<p>

        "I taught her."<p>

Number 71 is the S-15 Truck from Minuteman Science-Technology High School in
Lexington MA.  David Pichulo expained it to me.  He worked on the control
board and did the fund racing.  The conversion is based on the design that Bob
Batson of Electric Vehicles of America does.  The car is actually named
"George", but that name never shows up on the standings.  They started the car
in March when a teacher suggested it as a project.  They got a lot of things
donated, including the GMC S-15 Sierra from the Conservation Division from the
town of Lincoln MA, who will get the EV truck at the end of the race.  They
finished working on the truck the Saturday before the race and so the 20
Trojan T145 batteries are very new and haven't quite gotten up to full
capacity, so they didn't finish the first few days.  It weighs 3500 pounds.
About 40 people from the shop class worked on it.<p>
