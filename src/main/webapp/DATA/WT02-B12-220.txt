The purpose of Migration Dialogue is to promote among youngish

opinion leaders in an off-the-record setting a discussion of the

major immigration and integration issues likely to face the industrial

democracies over the coming decade. Three-day seminars are held

in places that allow participants during field trips to discuss

with immigrants, service providers, and others the day-to-day

issues involved in immigration and integration.

<P>

Discussion questions: When two groups share a geographic area,

two extremes delineate their possible interaction--integration

or assimilation (eliminating boundaries between groups, encouraging

convergence in language, values, earnings etc.) and pluralism

or multiculturalism (encouraging maintenance of cultural diversity,

tolerating or welcoming enclaves). These are sometimes referred

to as the melting pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating

immigrants.<BR>


<P>

1. What were the traditional modes of interaction in classic immigration

countries such as the US? What were the major factors that helped

immigrants to integrate successfully in the past--economic growth;

political leadership; integrating institutions such as churches,

schools, political parties, unions, and the military; the number

of immigrants; immigrant characteristics? How many of these successful

integration policies were planned as integration instruments,

and which ones were the result of general social policies and

goals? Why are the Americanization policies that successfully

integrated immigrants in the past decried by some today? How do

the integration policies of Canada and Australia differ from those

of the United States?<BR>


<P>

2. What factors guided integration policies in European countries?

How were integration policies and the perceptions of immigrant

integration affected by the reasons for the arrival of migrants?

For example, were there differences in integration policies and

experiences between &quot;immigrants&quot; from former colonies,

guestworkers, and ethnic minorities relocating to the &quot;mother

country?&quot; How have integration policies and attitudes changed

as migration flows become more diverse?<BR>


<P>

3. How do immigration policy instruments such as family unification,

efforts to prevent illegal immigration, and other policies designed

to manage the influx of newcomers affect integration patterns

today? Which seems most important in affecting prospects for successful

integration--the number of immigrants to be integrated, or their

&quot;differentness&quot; from the native population? <BR>


<P>

4. What are the trade-offs in integration policy? Is the major

trade-off that between numbers and integration success? Or is

it between &quot;differentness&quot; and integration success,

meaning that it is easier to integrate large numbers of similar

immigrants than small numbers of persons who are very different

in language, religion, or culture. 

<P>

To what extent are per country &quot;quotas&quot; or &quot;ceilings&quot;

useful in preserving multi-national and multi-ethnic flows of

immigrants that minimize separatism? Does continuous immigration

from the same country affect the integration patterns of those

already present?

<B>1:00-3:00 PM Integration and Immigration--How do native perceptions

of integration affect immigration and immigrant policy? </B>

<P>

The focus in this session is on native reactions to immigrants.

This session is designed to explore how the perceptions of natives

about the ability of their societies to integrate the newcomers

affects their support for their society's immigration policies.

An underlying question is whether anti-immigrant reactions are

cyclical reflections of economic or political insecurity, or whether

they are structural reflections of demographic and other trends.

<P>

1. How do current residents determine what constitutes the successful

integration of immigrants? What kind of integration indicators

do they look to: economic? language? crime? political activities?

immigrant children? intermarriage? <BR>


<P>

2. What tend to be the flashpoints that set off anti-immigrant

native reactions? language? religion? race? How relevant are low

fertility rates of natives in the immigration society, so that

a disproportionate share of babies are born to immigrants? How

does the geographic concentration of immigrants affect integration?

What roles are played by the nature of political and party systems?

<BR>


<P>

3. Does ethnic militancy generate a native backlash that inhibits

integration. For example, if Muslims insist that girls wear headscarves

to school, does the French reaction to Muslim religious strictures

inhibit their integration? Similarly, how does bilingual education

that encourages immigrant children to maintain their native language

affect native reactions and integration prospects?<BR>


<P>

4. How did worries over integration affect immigration policy

in the past? What are the effects of anti-immigrant political

movements on native reactions to the perception and reality of

immigrant integration?<BR>

<P>

Discussion questions: This session focuses on the immigrants,

and is designed to provide case studies of how well immigrants

are integrating as measured by various integration indicators.

An underlying question is how the success or failure to accommodate

immigrants affects immigration policy.<BR>


<P>

1. What do France, Germany, and the US do to integrate immigrants?

Do these policies vary by type of immigrant, immigrant needs (how

evaluated?), or economic and other conditions at the time in the

immigration or emigration country?<BR>


<P>

2. What are the most important indicators of immigrant integration--their

place in the labor market, earnings, education, prison and welfare

use, intermarriage, naturalization, etc.--and how do they vary

by type of immigrant (family, humanitarian, economic), country

of origin, and other immigrant characteristics? Is there such

a thing as &quot;segmented assimilation?&quot;

<P>

3. Has the creation of publicly-funded immigrant assistance programs

and organizations helped to steer immigrant integration in certain

directions--e.g. Cubans have tended to seek private sector opportunities

more than Southeast Asian refugees, whose leaders in many cases

provide government-funded social services to their communities?

<BR>


<P>

4. To what extent does and should our ability to predict who is

most likely to integrate successfully be used to make immigration

policy?<BR>


<P>

5. What is the role of citizenship and naturalization rules in

integration? Would adoption of jus soli and easing naturalization

rules promote integration? What are the effects on integration

of recent changes in citizenship laws in France and Germany? Should

an in-between legal status be developed, such as &quot;denizen,&quot;

for settled immigrants who choose not to naturalize?<BR>

<P>

This is the report of the third Migration Dialogue seminar, which

was held on September 15-18, 1995 in Paris. Migration Dialogue

seminars provide an opportunity for 35 to 40 opinion leaders to

discuss in an intensive and off-the-record setting the major immigration

and integration issues facing the industrial democracies. Each

seminar includes field trips, so that participants can learn about

these issues directly from immigrants and immigration and integration

authorities.<BR>


<P>

This report was prepared after the seminar, and is being distributed

to participants in the Paris seminar, as well as previous Migration

Dialogue seminars, and to other interested parties. It has not

been read or approved by participants, and should not be construed

as a consensus document discussed and debated by participants.

An agenda and list of participants are attached.<BR>


<P>

The major question discussed in Paris was sharply focused: do

fears that newcomers cannot integrate successfully prompt efforts

to reduce or stop immigration flows? One participant argued forcefully

that the answer is yes--the first step to deal with the integration

of foreigners and their children is, in this opinion, to stop

immigration. Only then could governments tackle the problems associated

with integration, which range from the isolation of immigrants

in housing and schools to federal-local tax and power issues.

<BR>


<P>

Other participants did not agree that it was necessary to stop

immigration in order to integrate newcomers. They emphasized that

many of the problems identified with integrating immigrants would

not necessarily be on the way to resolution if immigration simply

stopped.<BR>


<P>

On the field trips, participants discussed the process for issuing

residence permits to foreigners with immigration police, and accompanied

them on walks through Sentier and Barbes, two garment districts

filled with immigrant workers in Paris. Participants visited the

largest mosque in France, and heard from &igrave;official&icirc;

Muslim leaders that fundamentalists were only a small fraction

of the three to four million Muslims in France.<BR>


<P>

Participants visited Montfermeil, a sububan city outside Paris

with a population of 26,000 that is composed of about one-third

immigrants and their children. Immigrants there are concentrated

in a handful of 1960s-era six-story apartment blocks, and their

children attend schools that serve mostly immigrant children.

To promote integration, the French government has hired additional

social workers and added teachers, but has no plans to mix native-born

and immigrant children through active public housing or transportation

policies.<BR>


<P>

Because of security concerns arising from the recent bombings

in Paris, schools were deemed off limits to visitors. In place

of visiting a school with immigrant children, French teachers

came to the meeting to discuss issues involved in educating immigrant

children.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341655">Immigration Policies and Integration

Patterns</A> </H1>


<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341656">Will Immigration Continue?</A> </H2>


<P>

Will large scale immigration, and thus the need to integrate newcomers

in industrial democracies, continue in the 21st century? Migration

is a result of differences--especially differences in economic

opportunity and security--and these differences are widening,

increasing potential migration.<BR>


<P>

The number of people who would like to migrate is probably many

times the number who actually do, so that increased potential

migration does not necessarily result in a comparable increase

in migrants. But widening differences, and wars and other crises,

promise continued immigration despite recent efforts to reduce

immigration into France, Germany, and the US. Dealing with unwanted

immigration, it was emphasized, is likely to be a major challenge

in the 21st century. <BR>


<P>

Continuing unwanted immigration highlights the growing gap between

immigration policy goals and outcomes in industrial democracies.

In few other areas of public policy is the credibility of governments

so low. For example, French governments since 1974 have implied

that immigration has stopped, reducing the credibility of the

government when blue-collar workers observed immigrants moving

into their neighborhoods. This is one reason why, in several European

countries, political parties whose primary or major aim is to

reassert control over immigration have obtained 10 to 20 percent

of all votes.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341657">World Population and Migration</A>

</H2>


<P>

The world's population of about 5.7 billion in mid-1995 was distributed

among 185-odd countries. Each country has its own definition of

citizen and foreigner, which makes determining the number of migrants

difficult, but the best estimates are that there are about 125

million persons living outside their country of citizenship. About

two percent of the world's population are legal or illegal immigrants,

refugees and asylum seekers, or migrant workers.<BR>


<P>

There are two ways to look at this &quot;nation of migrants.&quot;

First, the nation of migrants is equivalent in size to the world's

eighth most populous nation, Japan, and is growing faster than

the world's population. Immigration is also contributing significantly

to population growth in industrial democracies--it accounts for

half or more of the population growth in countries such as the

US and Canada, and immigration prevents population declines in

low fertility nations such as Germany.<BR>


<P>

Second, many of the world's migrants are moving from relatively

fast-growing and therefore &quot;young&quot; developing nations

and toward aging societies. Aging and demographically stable societies

may resist the social changes that accompany immigration. This

means that a society's &quot;demographic need&quot; for immigrants

may be the opposite of its willingness to accept them. <BR>


<P>

Third, there is no &quot;natural&quot; end in sight to the current

wave of migrants. Population growth, economic disparities, and

war and persecution are likely to continue to produce migrants

and refugees for the foreseeable future, and most observers believe

that the number of opportunity- and refugee-seeking migrants will

increase rather than decrease in the 21st century.<BR>


<P>

On the other hand, those who believe that migration is a manageable

challenge for the industrial democracies begin with the observation

that the world's &quot;nation of migrants&quot; involves two percent,

not 20 percent, of the world's population, <I>despite </I>demographic,

economic, and other factors that might be expected to produce

a world on the move. In other words, most people stay in their

country of birth, despite more borders to cross, and more incentives

to cross them. <BR>


<P>

For example, one of the world's major countries of emigration,

Mexico, has 100 million people currently alive born within its

borders, and over 90 percent of them still live in their country

of birth. Over 90 percent of the 70 million persons born in the

Philippines live there.<BR>


<P>

Furthermore, countries can control immigration. Germany's 1993

asylum reforms, some argue, were able to reduce by two-thirds

the number of asylum applicants in that country without offsetting

increases in illegal immigration.<BR>


<P>

But there is uncertainty and skepticism about the long-term effectiveness

of immigration control measures. The US, for example, thought

in the late 1980s that illegal immigration was under control,

and that the economic boom would persist, so that the US increased

the number of immigration slots both to unify families and to

fill vacant jobs. These assumptions have proven false, prompting

another round of immigration reforms aimed at reducing legal and

illegal immigration.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341658">Definitions</A> and Questions </H2>


<P>

Before turning to integration issues in more detail, a few definitions

are in order. When two or more distinct groups share a geographic

area, two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration

or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,

encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism

or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging

the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming

ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting

pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.

<BR>


<P>

The discussion found several points of agreement. First, settled

immigrants should be naturalized citizens, but there is a sharp

contrast between the US goal of encouraging naturalization, and

France and Germany offering a naturalization option, but not encouraging

naturalization. Many participants argued that Germany discourages

naturalization. <BR>


<P>

Second, integration is easiest to achieve with young children

in families that want to settle, which makes language and schools

key instruments to ensure that newcomers are integrated by the

second generation. Third, there is a relationship between immigration

and integration, in the sense that a continued influx of foreigners

may make immigrants less interested in integrating, and natives

less willing to make the adaptations required for integration

and may make the integration process in general more difficult.

<BR>


<P>

However, what was striking were the apparent differences in the

<B>concept</B> of integration. Blood (i.e. genetics) largely defines

who is German, the ability to speak French largely defines who

is French, and being born in the US, or learning some English

and civics, defines Americans.<BR>


<P>

The discussion centered on several issues. First, exactly what

are the trade-offs, if any, between continuing immigration and

integration? What are the appropriate parameters--the number of

immigrants, or how similar the newcomers are to current residents

in language and religion? By how much is integration eased by

an economic &quot;need&quot; for newcomers, or guilt over the

plight of refugees or ethnic members abroad?<BR>


<P>

Second, is integration eased by governments that are forthright

and clear in spelling out country priorities as to the annual

number of immigrants, their characteristics, and their distribution

by country of origin?<BR>


<P>

Third, to what extent is there a universal relationship between

numbers of immigrants and ease of integration? Are there &quot;waves&quot;

of immigrants precisely because large numbers of immigrants set

in motion forces that eventually reduce immigration?

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341659">Integrating Quasi Immigrants</A> 

</H2>


<P>

Disagreement on exactly how to curb immigration as newcomers continue

to arrive has led to a proliferation of in-between immigration

statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status. These statuses permit

foreigners to remain legally in the country, and sometimes to

work, but they do not grant the secure status of residents who

are expected to settle that is assumed in most theories of how

societies integrated newcomers.<BR>


<P>

In the 1990s, for example, the US acquired its largest-ever number

of &quot;unwanted immigrants.&quot; Today, about two percent of

the US population--some four to five million persons--are unauthorized

or quasi-authorized aliens. <BR>


<P>

In other words, despite high levels of <I>legal</I> immigration,

as many as 50 percent more &igrave;unwanted&icirc; foreigners

are arriving in the US, and there are fears that the control systems

in place cannot prevent their entry, or enforce their departure.

<BR>


<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>Europe faces a similar situation. Even though

most European countries do not consider themselves countries of

immigration, in 1992 some three million &igrave;foreigners&icirc;

arrived in Western European nations. </FONT>

<P>

About half of Europe's newcomers arrived outside normal immigration

channels. Most European nations permit family unification for

citizens and resident aliens without quotas and waiting lists

but, in addition, some 700,000 foreigners applied for asylum in

1992; another 400,000 persons fleeing the Yugoslav war arrived

and were handled outside the asylum system; and an estimated 400,000

unauthorized aliens arrived.

<P>

Indeed, since European nations in the early 1990s launched individual

and collective efforts to reassert control over immigration, the

number of newcomers arriving each year has remained in the two

to three million range, but an ever larger share of all newcomers

are in illegal or quasi legal statuses.

<P>

Immigrants are arriving on both sides of the Atlantic through

front, side, and back doors. Front-door immigration includes family

unification, immigrants who arrive with permission to fill vacant

jobs, and refugee admissions--in most cases, these immigrants

are expected to settle and to become fellow citizens. Side-door

immigrants are foreigners in the country for a specific time and

purpose, such as tourists, students, or &quot;temporary&quot;

workers. As such, they are expected to leave the country, not

to integrate. Back-door immigrants are those who became residents

unlawfully and are to be deported rather than integrated.<BR>


<P>

There are many issues involved in integrating foreigners into

their new host societies, but three stand out. First, the number

of planned-for legal immigrants is at historic highs, and these

immigrants are often quite different from resident populations

in language, religion, and the ability to quickly earn as much

as the native born. <BR>


<P>

The fact that many newcomers have low incomes raises issues as

to how much governments should intervene and assist newcomers.

Canada and Australia have programs that provide assistance to

newcomers, the US provides such assistance mostly to refugees,

and Germany confines special language and welfare assistance mostly

to ethnic Germans who return to Germany and are immediately eligible

to become German citizens.<BR>


<P>

Second, immigration societies today differ from the classic immigration

countries at the turn of the century. There is less political

consensus that assimilation into the host society's language and

culture should occur as rapidly as possible, or even at all. Integrating

institutions such as churches, the military, labor unions, and

schools are smaller or less sure of their role in integrating

newcomers today than they were in the past. <BR>


<P>

As one participant noted, a society must have confidence in its

policies for integrating domestic minorities and poor persons

if it is to develop an integration policy for foreigners. Policies

that may be controversial in their own right, such as affirmative

action or busing, may be doubly controversial when available to

immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Third, integration is difficult when so many of the newcomers

are in unauthorized or quasi-authorized legal statuses. At the

turn of the century, immigrants to the US were presumed to want

to settle, and Americanization tried to speed up their integration.

<BR>


<P>

Today, countries do not have such simple either/or integration

policies. They may <I>want to</I> integrate some immigrants rapidly,

but encourage others, such as students and temporary workers,

to adhere to their plans to leave when their education or employment

is complete. But since all types of aliens may be in proximity

to each other--sometimes in the same family--it is very hard to

avoid contradictions between immigration control and integration

policies.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341660">Native Perceptions</A> </H1>


<P>

Most people in industrial democracies think that immigration should

be reduced. But most industrial democracies link immigration and

integration in Grand Bargains that, e.g., couple new controls

on illegal immigration with an amnesty or an easier path to naturalization.

In France, for example, late 1970s and early 1980s efforts to

deport Algerians, and then to pay workers with residence and employment

rights to depart, were followed by programs in 1984 that promoted

integration.<BR>


<P>

However, France also provides a case study of how governments

lose credibility on immigration by tolerating growing gaps between

immigration policies and realities. France announced in 1974 that

foreign workers from outside the EU could no longer enter France

as probationary immigrants. <BR>


<P>

French politicians assured anxious publics that immigration had

been stopped. However, family unification and illegal immigration

continued. Local residents often failed to appreciate the categories

through which newcomers entered; they only knew that foreigners

were still arriving in their neighborhoods. As a result, governmental

credibility declined to the point that, in some polls, the most

credible spokesperson on immigration issues in France today is

the National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.<BR>


<P>

Continuing immigration has complicated the process of integrating

especially the four to five million Muslims immigrants in France.

At the beginning of the 20th century, France successfully integrated

Italian and other Catholic immigrants by persuading them fairly

quickly to learn French; familiarity with French and French culture

also expedited the integration of immigrants from French colonies.

<BR>


<P>

France is today debating how best to integrate Muslim and Black

African immigrants who may have less appreciation for French and

French culture. In some neighborhoods, as many as 30 different

languages are spoken. 

<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341661">The Instruments of Integration Policy--What

works?</A> </H1>


<P>

Integrating resident foreigners is described as a top priority

in France, Germany, and the US, but there is remarkably little

agreement on the best public policy instruments to integrate foreigners.

However, most participants agreed that learning the native language

was important for economic success and to minimize native fears

of foreigners, and that the schools were the key to integrating

the second generation.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341662">France</A> </H2>


<P>

Some French politicians argue that policies that successfully

integrated immigrants in the past no longer work, and that what

is needed is an immigration stop, coupled with a renewed effort

to restructure housing and welfare policies and reverse the trend

toward family breakup. In language that echoes California Governor

Pete Wilson, it was asserted that the minimum welfare assistance

of roughly 2800FF ($550) per month offered to immigrants in France

keeps them from seeking employment.<BR>


<P>

The list of problems attributed to or aggravated by immigrants

in France is long, and this leads to the calls for an immigration

stop. What is less clear is how to seek solutions, and where to

start. <BR>


<P>

For example, some argue that the starting point for integrating

immigrants in France is to start with their housing--demolish

the high-rise apartment blocks that concentrate them far from

jobs, and segregate immigrant children in schools.<BR>


<P>

Another key to integration, some believe, is to change the structure

of the French government. France gives considerable power to mayors--many

members of the National Assembly are also mayors--and the need

to be re-elected allegedly prevents mayors from assembling and

coordinating the regional resources necessary to help immigrants

get access to housing, transportation, and jobs. A return to central

power, it was argued, is necessary to get the French economy moving

again, as well as to integrate foreigners by imposing sometimes

unpopular housing and schooling policies at the local level.<BR>


<P>

Others would put more money into educating immigrants. There are

two problems with this approach. First, hiring teachers for immigrant

schools, or social workers for their parents, may not integrate

immigrants already isolated from French children and jobs. <BR>


<P>

Second, France has little latitude for additional public expenditures.

France already collects more of what the economy produces in taxes

than any other major industrial country--44 percent of GDP was

collected in taxes in 1993, versus 40 percent in Germany, and

30 percent in the US. <BR>


<P>

The new government in 1995 raised the minimum wage as well as

the standard VAT or sales tax to 20 percent and, despite promises

of deregulation to stimulate private sector job creation to reduce

the 12 percent unemployment rate, the tradition of a strong central

government in France makes it tempting to try to spend any additional

integration resources in a top-down fashion, but with deference

to local politicians.<BR>


<P>

Neither France nor Germany encourages immigrants to naturalize,

but France makes naturalization easy for most children born in

France.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341663">Germany</A> </H2>


<P>

The German naturalization dilemma is that there is no consensus

on the ultimate aim of integration. According to some Germans,

naturalization should be the goal of integration, so that Germany

stops re-producing foreigners within its borders.<BR>


<P>

However, Germany is reluctant to admit that it is a country of

immigration, and thus it is hard to agree on a package of measures

that immigration countries would consider natural, including explicit

guidelines on who can immigrate and naturalize. Under German policies

adopted in 1981, foreigners age 16 to 23, with 8 years residence

and six years of German schooling, can be naturalized practically

automatically.<BR>


<P>

Germans noted the significant differences between integration

programs for ethnic Germans and other foreigners. Upon their arrival,

descendants of Germans who emigrated to the former USSR--sometimes

hundreds of years ago--are entitled to German citizenship as well

as six months of language training, and welfare payments and job

search assistance. Other newcomers, by contrast, do not have access

to special integration services, although there are a variety

of job training programs available to foreign-resident youth.

<BR>


<P>

Muslim immigrants are a special concern in Germany, even though

they are less than half of the immigrant population. There are

widespread fears that fundamentalist teachers will turn disaffected

youth into a potential anti-native underclass, but most efforts

to head off such a result seem to be local and spontaneous rather

than national efforts that most observers believe will work.<BR>


<P>

There was a lengthy discussion of why European governments who

have acknowledged integration issues are so slow to act. Some

French participants emphasized that there remain significant differences

among EU countries in policies that range from naturalization

to controlling drugs, so that immigration and integration issues

are as likely to lead to confrontation among EU states rather

than cooperation. Examples of &igrave;naturalization dumping&icirc;--Turks

moving to France so that their children can more easily be naturalized--are

undoubtedly rare, but are invoked to argue that Schengen border

controls cannot be lifted right away.<BR>


<P>

Most economic and social indicators of integration indicate that

foreigners are poorer and less educated than the native born.

As with the US Black-white unemployment rate, the unemployment

rate for foreign workers in Germany is twice the rate for the

native born. More detailed analyses indicate that there are also

significant differences in economic indicators by ethnic group,

with the most different groups--Turks in Germany, or Blacks and

Muslims in France--at the bottom of labor market and earnings

pyramids.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341664">United States</A> </H2>


<P>

The US has few immigrant integration programs, aside from refugee

resettlement and bilingual education programs. Instead, the US

typically &igrave;assigns&icirc; individuals to groups, allows

representatives to negotiate for the group, and manages to integrate

groups in the resulting social change. <BR>


<P>

The current wave of immigrants to the US is becoming &igrave;Americanized&icirc;

but, since most newcomers move into central cities filled with

a US underclass, many immigrants are integrating by adapting to

central city values, including illegitimate births, welfare, and

crime.<BR>


<P>

The &igrave;group integration&icirc; of the US allows the characteristics

of a subgroup to represent the entire group. Even though less

than one-fourth of the roughly 15 million foreign-born Hispanics

in the US are illegal immigrants, Latino immigrants are often

tagged with the illegal label. <BR>


<P>

According to some Americans, the major mechanism for integrating

minority groups, including immigrants, are the tools developed

in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. It is for this reason,

it is argued, that Latino immigrants have adopted the position

of a minority needing government assistance to be integrated in

the US. <BR>


<P>

Latinos, in this view, had the bad luck to arrive in the US at

a time when the Civil Rights instruments of integration have been

discredited, but before other integration instruments were developed.

<BR>


<P>

Opinion on immigration in the US has been volatile and has changed

quickly over the past year. In the early 1990s, there was discussion

of new federal expenditures to expedite the integration of immigrants.

In 1995, there is widespread agreement that legal and illegal

immigration should be reduced, and the social service system scaled

back. <BR>


<P>

The US must deal with three areas that affect the integration

of immigrants as well as other fundamental aspects of US society.

First, what services will the government provide, and on what

terms? Second, what happens to the US assumption of upward mobility

in a static economy? Third, what policies will the US develop

to broker ethnic differences?<BR>


<P>

Governments on both sides of the Atlantic are scaling back the

welfare state, and deregulating their economies. As a result,

immigrants will have to fend more for themselves in restructuring

economies and societies. <BR>


<P>

Early this century, immigrants fending for themselves in industrializing

America achieved substantial social and economic upward mobility,

and in many cases helped to produce the modern welfare state as

a reaction against some attributes of market economies. It is

not clear what immigrants fending for themselves in post-industrial

and slow growing societies will produce.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341665">Attacking the Root Causes</A> </H1>


<P>

International migration is a big business. There are some 60 million

foreigners in the world's 24 richest nations, and the half of

them in the labor force send at least $40 to $50 billion each

year to their countries of origin. In countries from Algeria to

ex-Yugoslavia, remittances are a major source of foreign exchange.

<BR>


<P>

Could the industrial democracies that are trying to reduce unwanted

immigration provide emigration countries with trade, investment,

and aid in a manner that reduces unwanted immigration? And, if

trade concessions are opposed by some sectors of immigration countries,

such as farmers and steel workers, can the fear of unwanted migration

be used to nonetheless adopt free-trade policies?<BR>


<P>

In 1990, the &quot;One-World Group&quot; of European public television

networks produced a film, &quot;The March&quot; designed to show

viewers that it would be better to provide more aid to Africa

than to deal with the arrival of desperate African migrants. There

is no evidence that such efforts to convince taxpayers to step

up development assistance have succeeded; aid budgets have not

increased significantly.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341666">Trade</A> </H2>


<P>

There is no disagreement that immigrants tend to flow from poorer

to richer countries, but, in a world in which per capita income

differences are on the order of 25 to 1 between rich and poor

countries, the surprise may be how little, not how much, international

migration for employment occurs. <BR>


<P>

In spite of demand-pull, supply-push, and network factors that

could be expected to increase migration across borders, only about

two percent of the world&iacute;s population lives outside their

country of citizenship, and less than 10 percent of the population

of most industrial countries were born abroad.<BR>


<P>

The most significant economic policy change in the 1990s is the

worldwide shift toward free markets. In industrial countries,

market opening is evidenced by free trade pacts, including the

EU-92 program in Europe, and by the deregulation of labor and

other markets.<BR>


<P>

But the adoption of free market programs has been most noticeable

in several of the major developing countries from which many migrants

come. Mexico, Turkey, and the Philippines, for example, have announced

ambitious plans to privatize state-run industries, open themselves

to free trade and investment, and deregulate their labor and product

markets.<BR>


<P>

These free market policies should, over time, speed up economic,

job, and wage growth, and thus reduce economically-motivated migration.

But the transition from a closed to an open economy is neither

easy nor assured of success.<BR>


<P>

Indeed, most economists believe developing nations that embrace

free market policies first experience <B>increased</B> pressures

favoring outmigration. This makes it very hard for an industrial

country such as the US to embrace freer trade with an emigration

country such as Mexico. US opponents of such free trade policies

can complain that jobs will flee south, while workers will flee

north, and this job loss-migration hump may persist for a generation

or more.<BR>


<P>

Furthermore, free trade policies may not succeed. There is no

assurance that simply adopting such policies will automatically

produce faster growth. Free market policies tend to have high

failure rates, for reasons that include corruption, the replacement

of public monopoly with private monopoly, and policy mistakes.

<BR>


<P>

In light of the migration hump and uncertainty of success, why

embrace free trade and investment? The answer is simple--there

is no alternative strategy that has proven its ability to accelerate

economic growth and thereby reduce emigration pressure.<BR>


<P>

Free trade enables emigration countries to grow their way out

of emigration pressure--both countries ride up the escalator toward

more jobs and higher wages, but the emigration country rises faster,

much as Europe &quot;caught up&quot; with the US in the 1960s.

There is an alternative--wage gaps can also be lessened by the

migration of workers from low to higher wage countries, reducing

the growth of wages in industrial democracies. <BR>


<P>

But a migration-induced narrowing of wage differences has different

socio-economic consequences. Emigration areas that live off remittances

can turn into bedroom communities for foreign labor markets, so

that migration depresses wages in the immigration country, and

does not generate stay-at-home development. The result can be

dependence on a foreign labor market, and tensions over immigration.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341667">Cautions</A> </H2>


<P>

There are several problems associated with implementing policies

to free up trade and investment and thereby reduce emigration

pressures. First, the process through which economic transformations

generate faster growth are neither smooth nor sure. Many emigration

countries depend on tariffs for 30 to 40 percent of government

revenues, so changing economic policies means that the government

has fewer resources when the need for assistance is greatest.

<BR>


<P>

Second, industrial countries often urge emigration nations to

adopt free trade policies, but then they restrict imports of precisely

those goods that emigration nations are most capable of exporting,

such as agricultural and labor-intensive commodities. <BR>


<P>

Third, there is no assurance that free trade policies will &igrave;work.&icirc;

Success depends on many factors, including confidence, and policy

mistakes can quickly turn a country such as Turkey or Mexico from

success to pariah. In many cases, it makes little sense for a

government to adopt the free trade and investment policies if

the &igrave;fundamentals&icirc; are not in place. There is probably

little current investor interest in, for example, Algeria, even

if the government rolled out the red carpet for foreign investors,

and this situation is likely to persist until the conflict is

resolved.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341668">Aid</A> </H2>


<P>

One difference between European and American attitudes toward

policies to reduce emigration pressures is captured in the adage:

Americans believe in trade, not aid, while Europeans want aid,

not trade. The US gives very little aid to Mexico, but signed

NAFTA, while Europe keeps out many North African agricultural

commodities but provides significant aid.<BR>


<P>

In 1994, the OECD countries provided $58 billion in aid to developing

nations. However, much of this aid flows from one government to

another, and little of it is concentrated in emigration areas

to deter emigration. 

<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341669">Focus on France</A> </H1>


<P>

France is a country of 58 million with an average per capita income

of about $22,000. The 1995 election was fought largely over how

to deal with the country's persistent 11 to 12 percent unemployment

rate, or how to avoid the reinforcement of a two-tiered society

with an underclass of French and foreign residents.<BR>


<P>

France is Europe&iacute;s traditional country of immigration.

France was practically unique in having an early fertility decline

beginning as early as the late 18th century, and fear of population

decline that would make the country more vulnerable to rival Germany

prompted both pro-natalist and expansionary immigration policies.

France was among the world&iacute;s first countries to develop

an immigration system, and France has what is for Europe an easy

path to naturalization. <BR>


<P>

The second unique aspect about French immigration is the so-called

&quot;Republican model&quot; of integration, which asserts the

need for a commonality of French language and culture--both French

rural-urban migrants as well as immigrants were expected to learn

French and behave as the French do in public. Any language, religious,

or cultural differences should be celebrated only in private.

<BR>


<P>

This system worked reasonably well to integrate European immigrants,

and immigrants from former French colonies familiar with the French

language and culture. Today, almost one in three French residents

is believed to have at least one foreign-born grandparent. 

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341670">Past and Present</A> </H2>


<P>

Past immigrants were integrated into French society by a combination

of a relatively easy path to citizenship--virtually all children

born in France can become French citizens at age 18; secular schools

that inculcated French and French values; by the assembly-line

organization of the military and heavy industries that integrated

both immigrants and rural to urban French migrants; and by the

Catholic church.<BR>


<P>

These integrating institutions assured that children born or educated

in France considered themselves French as adults. The French,

in turn, were confident that they could use their language and

culture to integrate foreigners--foreigners from any of the 27

countries that use French as an official language, such as Belgium

and Lebanon, can naturalize as soon as they receive residence

permits in France, instead of waiting for at least two years.

<BR>


<P>

Today, there is less certainty in France and elsewhere that past

integrating instruments will work for today's immigrants. One

thing that makes France unique is that, unlike other immigration

countries that are experimenting with bilingual education and

religious diversity in public places, many French policy makers

resist changing policies that have &quot;worked.&quot; Others

say that it is high time that France wake up to the new immigration,

the new Europe, and the new world of migration.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341671">Residence and Work</A> </H2>


<P>

Foreigners in France for more than three months need residence

permits--one-year residence permits are usually obtained for 200FF

($40) after 20 minute interviews with the French immigration police.

After three years of continuous lawful residence and employment,

or 10 years lawful residence, a foreigner can obtain a ten-year

residence permit for 250FF.<BR>


<P>

Several areas of Paris, such as Sentier near the Gare du Nord,

are known to harbor significant numbers of illegal alien workers.

France until 1991 attempted to curb illegal alien employment by

removing illegal alien workers from workplaces, and perhaps from

France. Since 1991, immigration police and labor inspectors put

much more emphasis on sanctioning employers and labor smugglers-middlemen.

<BR>


<P>

In 1991, the French developed a fax system that enables employers

to check on the legal status of newly hired workers--employers

fax copies of residence and work permits to the police and labor

departments and, if there is no response from the authorities,

the worker is legal. The percentage of newly-hired workers believed

by these departments to be unauthorized in targeted industries

such as garments has fallen from one-third to 10 percent.<BR>


<P>

Immigration and labor inspectors receive tips from other employers,

and from each other, about places in which illegal aliens are

employed. Since 1993, they have another source of tips--employers

must report newly-hired workers at least eight days before hiring

them to social security, not within eight days of putting them

to work. In this way, inspectors can be alerted by the social

security system before illegal workers go to work.<BR>


<P>

The Sentier area is a garment manufacturing district that hires

significant numbers of illegal aliens in sewing lofts above display

shops. There is a general level of tolerance for illegal behavior

in the area, from traffic violations to prostitution. However,

tightened labor law enforcement has apparently pushed much of

the sewing involving illegal workers to the suburbs.<BR>


<P>

The French government has recently taken several highly visible

steps against illegal immigration, including the chartering of

airplanes to return illegal aliens to their countries of origin.

For historical reasons, the government is careful with both the

language and the form of transportation--aliens are returned,

not deported, and planes rather than trains are used to take aliens

to borders, partly because of fears that opponents of such policies

will associate them with Nazi deportations by train during World

War II. <BR>


<P>

Most experts believe that the charter airplanes are symbolic actions.

They point to a host of problems. It is expensive to charter planes,

and so the authorities wait until they have a plane load of aliens.

But French law permits detention of aliens awaiting return for

only 10 days, so that, if a full plane load of aliens is not available,

the government must set aliens free or take off with a partial

load. Many countries refuse to accept back persons who do not

have papers proving that they are e.g., Algerians.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341672">Schools and Integration</A> </H2>


<P>

Many French teachers are convinced that the key to integration

is learning French--in the words of one, &quot;own language instruction

is the road to failure.&quot; Indeed, in France, own language

instruction was advocated by those in the 1970s who hoped that

it would encourage return migration.<BR>


<P>

The result was a contradictory &quot;policy&quot; toward integration

that satisfied no one. Indeed, French teachers asserted that with

respect especially to young foreign children from homes in which

the parents wanted their children to learn French, it is feasible

and desirable to take non-French speakers into regular French

classes and, within several months, have the foreign children

speaking and working in French. This immersion approach, they

noted, also helped to integrate the foreigners socially.<BR>


<P>

In Germany, foreign children have had the right to attend K-12

schools since 1964. Germany is sensitive about the problems involved

in integrating older foreign children--especially those older

than 10 when they arrive in Germany.<BR>


<P>

Germany has a decentralized school system--each Land or state

is responsible for developing a curriculum, including how to teach

foreign children. German regulations have changed to prohibit

family unification of children over age 15, under the theory that

older children will be unable to learn enough in German schools

to succeed on the German labor market.<BR>


<P>

The German experience can be seen as a half empty or half full

glass. Optimists note that the number of foreign children completing

the vocational training for which Germany is famous has been rising,

as has the number of foreign children who go to university-preparatory

schools (Gymnasium).<BR>


<P>

However, pessimists note that more than 40 percent of foreign

youth fail to finish the equivalent of high school and, of those

who obtain vocational training, many of the foreign children select

sunset occupations such as mechanic or hairdresser. German handicraft

employers such as bakers are willing to take on foreign apprentices,

but some fear that these declining industries might be using foreigners

as cheap workers.<BR>


<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>In France, recent immigrants often find themselves

stranded in housing developments in Paris suburbs such as Monfermeil

about one-third of whose 26,000 residents are foreign. The area

has no direct transportation into Paris, and offers little industry

and few jobs. The few who are employed must travel more than an

hour to low-paying jobs in Paris. Los Bosquets, which occupies

three percent of the town, has 20 percent of its 20,000 population--most

of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants. Unemployment

is 25 percent.<BR>
