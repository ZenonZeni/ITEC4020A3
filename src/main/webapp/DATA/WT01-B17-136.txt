<h4>Question:</h4><p>
 
<b>What is a sleeping disorder and who is likely to have it?</b><p>

	The most common sleep disorder is insomnia of which there are 3 kinds. The most prevalent is sleep onset insomnia. Normally, a person should fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes of going to bed. If you consistently stay awake beyond 45 minutes, you have sleep-onset insomnia. The other insomnias are mid-sleep onset insomnia (waking up in the middle of the night) and early morning insomnia (waking up too early).<p> 
	Other people suffer from restless leg syndrome. Here the legs twitch convulsively in one-second muscle contractions, with sometimes 500 episodes a night, and this seriously disrupts sleep. Sleep apnea, or moments during sleep when you stop breathing, is a more serious problem, and is often associated with obesity and overuse of alcohol. The sleep apnea patient often wakes up suddenly gasping for air; a night of this and one wakes up quite fatigued in the morning.<p>
	Surely, being in bed but unable to sleep is one of the worst things in life. An estimated 49% of American adults today have had sleeping problems at one time in their lives. About 60 million people have chronic sleep disturbances, and women are twice as likely as men to have a sleep disorder and twice as likely to seek treatment.<p>
	According to a Gallup survey of 1027 adults in October 1995, nearly 49% of adult Americans have trouble sleeping, a 13% increase from 1991. Further, 35% have occasional insomnia, 12% have chronic insomnia, 25% believe you cannot be successful and get enough sleep, and more women (52%) have sleep problems than men (45%).<p>
	Many different types of people experience sleep disorders. It’s not just the stereotypical “Type A take-charge personality” who runs around all day and whose mind won’t turn off when it’s bedtime. Consider the case of Laurie.<p>
	She is a professional hair colorist who came to me in desperation over her insomnia. Laurie would wake up after 2 hours of sleep and rarely be able to fall asleep again. Conventional medicine hadn’t helped her and antibiotics made her sinus infections and skin conditions even worse. I suspected that the coloring chemicals she worked with and the antibiotics she had taken had made her liver toxic; a functional liver detoxification profile by Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratories confirmed our diagnosis.<p>
	At our suggestion, Laurie took a month off from work during which time I put her on a program which included liver detoxification, sacro-occipital chiropractic work, and applied kinesiology (which is both a means of diagnosis by muscle testing and a therapeutic process). At my clinic, we taught her stress reduction and breathing techniques, self-hypnosis, and acupressure as tools to put herself to sleep if she had trouble sleeping.<p>
	After 3 weeks on this program, Laurie began to sleep through the night and now, one year later, she is still doing well. She was not able to change her profession, so every month she does another liver detoxification. That, along with the adjustments she’s made in lifestyle, work to keep her sleeping soundly.<p><br><br>

<h4>Question:</h4><p>
 
<b>What causes sleeping disorders?</b><p>

	It is important to remember that sleeplessness is often a symptom, warning you about a system breakdown somewhere else in your body, so you need to pay attention when your body gives you this clue. A toxic liver is one factor. In addition to environmental toxins such as Laurie was exposed to, other factors including stress, anxieties, grief, illness, faulty diet, allergies, drugs, and biochemical deficiencies can all contribute to sleep difficulties.<p>
	It’s commonly believed that as we get older we should expect to sleep poorly. I disagree with that. How well you will sleep as you age depends on your lifestyle. If you are a senior citizen who has spent most of your life drinking alcohol, not exercising, abusing food and caffeine, your body will then serve you back with sleep problems. I have had many patients in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who sleep wonderfully well, because they have had healthy lifestyles.<p> 
	One of the main causes of sleeplessness, especially mid-sleep onset insomnia, is trouble in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. This is often related to taking antibiotics or exposure to toxic substances, even if it was many years ago. Antibiotics impair the intestinal tract and over time lodge in the liver rendering it toxic and unable to break down the poisons in the body. Instead, these flow into the bloodstream and the metabolic pathways. It is these poisons that cause people to wake up in the middle of the night. When a person goes through a liver detoxification program and the intestinal tract is rejuvenated, then the insomnia often disappears.<p> 
	Hormonal imbalances can be a major cause of sleep problems for women. The cycle of estrogen release is closely linked with the activities of the adrenal glands. Estrogens are necessary for the smooth functioning of the sleep cycle, so when women enter menopause and their estrogens start to fluctuate and diminish, if their adrenal glands and liver are stressed, they will probably experience disturbances in their sleep. Again, liver detoxification and adrenal support can eliminate this imbalanced relationship. Conversely, a strong, healthy liver and adrenal glands can be an alternative source of estrogens.<p>
	Further evidence of the role of the liver in sleep problems is the fact that about 33% of people who take Prozac for depression have sleep problems (paradoxically, a strong symptom of depression). The liver breaks down the chemicals in Prozac, but if the liver is toxic, it’s unable to perform this function. Again, a liver detoxification may remedy this.<p>
	One common sign of clinical depression is the early morning variety of insomnia. The person wakes up at 4:00 a.m., the mind starts working, and they go right into their depressive state, so that getting back to sleep is an impossibility. Depressed people often sleep during the day as an escape, so when night comes around they’re slept out.<p><br><br>
	
<h4>Question:</h4><p>

<b>What do you advise for getting over sleeping disorders?</b><p>

	We must look at the whole picture of diet and lifestyle. Does the person use alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, salt,  or sugar, or take recreational drugs? These can produce sleeping disorders. Does the person have a low blood sugar problem and over-consume sugar? This can make one wake up in the middle of the night craving more sugar.<p>
	If someone is particularly sensitive to caffeine (present in many foods and products besides tea and coffee), even having it at breakfast can affect sleep that night because caffeine can stay in the blood for up to 16 hours. If it does, slow caffeine clearance usually means the liver is not detoxifying the caffeine. The liver function test (mentioned above) and diagnostic stool analysis, can tell us this, along with information about toxin levels.<p>
	For treating the problems in the gastrointestinal tract, I use two detoxification products, called Ultraclear and Ultraclear Sustain. Depending on the severity of the problem, our patients will stay on this from 2-8 weeks, after which time most people feel a strong energy boost.<p>
 	I often recommend calcium and multimineral supplements. Many patients have systems that are too acidic and need to be more alkaline, a rebalancing that mineral supplements, which are alkaline and sedative in function, can achieve. <p>
	There is a psychological dimension to our anti-insomnia prescriptions, too. I find many sleeping disorder patients are highly introverted; their inward-turning daytime focus encourages sleeplessness. This means the more adventurously and interactively you live your day, the greater your guarantee of good sleep during the night.<p>
	In my sleep workshops, I emphasize avoiding the “victim complex.” When people say “I have insomnia,” in effect they have labeled themselves victims of their insomnia. I urge changing this to “I am going through the process of sleeplessness.” Then you can enter into and control this process.<p>
	For patients who need it, I provide chiropractic adjustments to correct any structural problems that are especially likely in the sacro-occipital relationship. If the cranial-sacral pump is not working efficiently, it cannot transmit the neural message and, as a result, will negatively affect every system of the body, interfering with its ability to relax its muscles. <p>
	Exercise is another important factor. The best time to exercise (with light to moderate aerobic exercise such as walking or swimming) is usually before 5 p.m. Vigorous exercise later than this will overstimulate the body and may keep you awake that night.<p>
	For people who have caffeine addiction problems, I prescribe an allersode called Caffeine Mix, an allergy desensitization remedy containing homeopathically prepared substances from tea, chocolate,  caffeine, cola, coffee, and histamine, plus components that work with the adrenals and liver.<p>
	Flora Plus is another homeopathic product I use for relief of bowel congestion and food-related digestive disturbances. Herbal teas are helpful. Use the sleep-promoting herbs: catnip, chamomile, lime blossom, and primrose.<p>
	For a foot or full-body herbal bath, use balm leaves (2 oz), boiled in a quart of water for 15 minutes; or angelica root (7 oz) in 2 quarts of cold water, then brought to a boil and steeped for 5 minutes. Or use valerian root (3-4 oz) to one quart of cold water; let this soak 10-12 hours, then briefly boil. Add the herbal liquid to your bath water and immerse yourself for 20 minutes. A sesame oil massage of the head and bottom of the feet works well for some people. <p><br><br>

<h4>Question:</h4><p>

<b>Does my bedroom have an effect on my sleeping problems?</b><p>

	Yes, quite often it does, so it’s important to look at your sleeping environment. Electromagnetic pollution is increasingly a problem. Put your electric clock away from your bed because the electromagnetic frequency it emits may be interfering with your sleep. <p>
	The same goes for cellular phones, electric blankets, and, for some especially sensitive people, metal beds. I prescribe a “Raya” pendant to wear during the day as a shield against electromagnetic pollution. Raya makes other products that create an energy field that reduces the effect of the electromagnetic pollution in the air around you and thereby allows you to sleep better. <p>
	The right room temperature during sleep is also important. The best sleeping temperature is between 60 and 70°F. If it is above 75, you may have nighttime awakening, increased movement in bed, and shallower sleep. The colors in your bedroom are a factor, too: stay away from red which is overstimulating.<p>
	Next, look at what you’re sleeping on. An estimated 7% of American adults with sleeping problems have uncomfortable mattresses. Cotton sheets and blankets are preferable to synthetic materials just as feather pillows are better than foam. A sheepskin mattress cover decreases movement during sleep and will help people have less pain from arthritic joints while sleeping. For people sensitive to nighttime noise or light, ear plugs and masks are helpful. A white-noise machine can aid sleep, too.<p><br><br>

<h4>Question:</h4><p>

<b>What can I do for myself to start sleeping better?</b><p>

	Here is a simple breathing exercise to do when you’re in bed. Take a breath in, hold for a count of 4, let it out, then inhale again. Do this 3 or 4 times. Repeat, holding the pause before the next inhalation. This changes the oxygen/carbon dioxide ratio in the blood and will promote sleep. <p>
	Here is a progressive muscle relaxation exercise in which you relax your muscles from head to toe, one region at a time. Clench then relax the muscles in your head, then your neck, then shoulders, arms, torso, hips, thighs, legs, ankles, and, finally, your feet. <p>
	There are acupressure points you can hold to help put yourself to sleep. Rub and press upon these for a couple of minutes while in bed, before sleeping: Kidney 6, called Joyful Sleep, located directly below the inside of the ankle bone on either foot; Bladder 62, called Calm Sleep, in the indentation on the outside of the ankle bone. There are two points on the forearm: Pericardium 6, called the Inner Gate, located in the middle of the inside of the forearm, 2-1/2 finger widths from the wrist crease; and Heart 7, called Spirit Gate, on the inside of the wrist crease in line with the little finger. <p>
	The brain hormone, melatonin, is an effective sleeping aid, especially for people with sleep-onset insomnia. The dosage I recommend is from 1-6 mg, taken 30-120 minutes before bedtime, although I adjust the dosage on an individual basis. Be sure your dosage is monitored by a health care professional. <p>
	I also give people Serotonin Dopamine Liquescence, a remedy containing 14 different homeopathically prepared substances. This stimulates the uptake of the brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, which will in turn increase the availability of melatonin and will help you sleep better.<p>
