ALT="Help Protect Your Company's Retirement Plan From Claims">
<BR CLEAR=ALL> 
A decision by the Supreme Court this past March (<I>Varity Corp.
v. Howe</I>) ruled that plan beneficiaries may sue on their own
behalf for breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA.  This was allowed
even though ERISA had historically prohibited participants from
bringing suit on their own behalf.  The decision concluded that
ERISA Sec. 502(a)(3) was intended to be a general &quot;catch-all&quot;
that would protect plan participants and beneficiaries, by allowing
participants to bring claims on their own behalf, as well as on
the behalf of the plan itself, in the case of an employer's alleged
misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>
Now some employers fear that they could be more vulnerable to
litigation.  Although more suits may indeed be filed as a result
of the Supreme Court ruling, you may help protect your interests
through proper plan communication and documentation.
<P>
<I><B>Comprehensive written documents</B></I>
<BR>
All of your company's benefits plans should be in writing. The
company's right to make changes to the plan should be clearly
spelled out in plan documentation. 
<P>
<I><B>Oral communication</B></I>
<BR>
Any communication about the plan, written or oral, could be used
in litigation.  Therefore, consider limiting the number of approved
plan spokespersons and refrain from oral statements about the
plan as much as possible.  A centralized benefits plan department
can help control the flow of information and make it less likely
that inappropriate information is communicated.
<P>
With proper plan disclosure you may be able to limit your company's
risk.  Consult your financial or tax advisor to ensure that your
plan's documentation is appropriate. If you know his or her e-mail
