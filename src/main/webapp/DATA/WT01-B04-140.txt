<H2><CENTER>Study shows MS patients further impaired by smoking low-THC
marijuana. </CENTER>
</H2>
Greenburg et al, in their paper in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,
Vol. 55:324-328, 1994, performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
study of inhaled marijuana smoke on balance and coordination responses in
ten adult patients with spastic multiple sclerosis, and normal volunteers
who were matched for age, sex, and weight. A sophisticated computer controlled
video system was used to identify responses. The study showed that marijuana
smoking enhanced the abnormalities already present in MS patients and that
smoking just one marijuana cigarette containing 1.5% delta-9 THC increased
the objective errors in these responses. The authors concluded that marijuana
smoking impairs coordination and balance in patients with spastic MS. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This is an objective and well done controlled
study which strongly refutes anecdotes suggesting that marijuana is beneficial
for patients with multiple sclerosis. In the absence of data showing any
benefit, this documentation of an adverse effect is disturbing and should
be heeded by those who would consider using smoked marijuana for treatment
of this disorder. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Low doses of THC found to cause learning deficits </CENTER>
</H2>
Kamine et al, in their article in Behavior of Pharmacology, Vol 5:71-78,
1994, studied the effects of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the learning
and performance ability of eight healthy subjects (19-32 years of age) all
of whom had occasionally used marijuana, as well as other psychoactive drugs,
but were not perceived to be drug dependent. Subjects were given placebo
capsules, and 10 mg. and 20 mg. capsules of THC, (&quot;...roughly equivalent
to smoking a marijuana cigarette containing 2.3-3.6% THC&quot;) <BR>
<BR>
Oral THC caused measurable learning deficits which, the authors concluded,
might be disasterous in some environments, such as operating &quot;the cab
of a speeding locomotive.&quot; They pointed out that the &quot;learning
deficit from a single dose might become quite relevant if it accumulates
over time.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> In regular marijuana users, the presence of
a learning deficit with a single dose of drugs and five hours of post-therapy
monitoring is sobering. In view of the greatly increased potentcy of marijuana
over the past decade and the recent rise in its use by teenagers and pre-adolescent
children, this should be particularly alarming to parents and educators.
This report contributes to the body of evidence showing that &quot;recreational
use of marijuana is not a benign habit in terms of intellectual performance.&quot;
<BR>
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana's implication in a number of chronic diseases reflects
its harmful impact on the immune system. </CENTER>
</H2>
Immune defenses against fungal organisms are triggered by natural killer
cells. If this system is upset, the susceptibility to fungal infections
is enhanced. Cusher et al, in their report in Cellular Immunology (Vol 154:99-108,
1994) incubated human large granular lymphocytes (human immune cells) with
varying concentrations of THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol). The concentrations
used mirrored what would be obtained in the blood of people smoking marijuana
or taking the drug dronabinol. They found that low levels of THC inhibited
tumor necrosis factor thereby weakening the killing activity of lymphocytes
against tumor cells. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> It is well-known that substance abuse may compromise
immune response to a variety of infectious agents. Marijuana, a widely abused
drug around the world, and its components, have adverse effects on the immune
system. This study is another of a series showing that, in the test tube,
concentrations of the major psychoactive metabolites of marijuana are capable
of impairing the ability of human immune cells to kill tumors and destroy
fungal cells. The importance of this report is that the relatively low concentrations
which mimic drug use in humans, cause these profound depressions of immune
activity. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana not listed in latest review of beneficial treatment
for Multiple Sclerosis </CENTER>
</H2>
Because of frequent claims that smoking marijuana provides therapeutic benefit
to victims of multiple sclerosis, the extensive and well documented review
of all the effective therapies for treatment of this disease, by G. C. Eber,
The Lancet, Vol 343, January 29, 1994, is included in this publication.
<BR>
<BR>
Eber notes in his review that multiple sclerosis (MS) &quot;...is unpredictable,
being characterized by a tendency to relapse and remission and/or to stabilisation
without treatment.&quot; He notes that the natural history of the disease
is well-defined and states that trial and error can no longer be reasonably
applied to the search for effective therapies. Eber concludes that although
clinical symptoms and anecdotes are valuable, highly sensitive objective
methods are now available in the form of serial MRI scans to document improvement
of the disease with such exciting therapies as beta-interferon. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This extremely complete review of multiple
sclerosis therapy puts to rest any contention that smoked marijuana is good
for this disorder and can be given without side effects. There simply are
no data to support the safe or effective use of either smoked marijuana
or dronabinol for treatment of MS. Eber's warning of the need for objective
data when judging a therapy for this complex disease is well worth heeding.

<H2><CENTER>Marijuana use linked to homicide </CENTER>
</H2>
In terms of life-time use, marijuana was reported to be the most common
illicit drug used by a sample of 268 murderers incarcerated in New York
State correctional facilites, for homicides that occurred in 1984. Spunt
et al (&quot;The Role of Marijuana in Homicide,&quot; International Journal
of the Addictions, Vol. 29:195-213,1994) <BR>
<BR>
About one-third of prisoners who had used marijuana, had used it in the
24-hour period before the homicide, and three-quarters of those said they
experienced some kind of effect from the drug when the homicide occurred.
The authors speculate that drugs and violence may be linked in a variety
of complex ways. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> It is clear that abnormal behavior induced
by the use of psychoactive drugs plays a significant role in violent crimes
which are completely unrelated to either drug profits or trafficking. Many
of the murderers interviewed for this study stated they felt that marijuana
use was a factor in their crimes. Recent well-publicized violent murders,
such as the tragic rape and murder of 12 year-old Polly Klaus, were also
committed by people who admitted to being under the influence of marijuana
at the time of their homicides. <BR>
