<B>50th Anniversary <BR>
of the Conservation Authorities Act


</B>

</CENTER><P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Conservation Authorities Act, a landmark piece of legislation that addressed the poor land-use practices and lack of flood control measures in the 1940s which led to frequent and damaging floods, extensive soil erosion, and insecure water supplies.<P>

Today, through the work of conservation authorities across much of the province, Ontario has incorporated watershed-based resource management planning,  and flood control measures into municipal and provincial strategic plans.<P>

"In recognizing this milestone in Ontario's history of  resource management," said Chris Hodgson, Minister of Natural Resources, "we salute the long-standing tradition of water management, natural heritage protection and outdoor recreation Ontario's conservation authorities have brought to their communities."<P>

"While we are celebrating 50 years of community-based watershed conservation in 1996, more importantly, we are looking to the future and the challenge of providing essential watershed services in a rapidly changing fiscal environment," said 
Gerry Houston, Chair of the Association of Conservation Authorities.<P>

"The government will continue to work with conservation authorities and municipalities to further define their roles, and to achieve efficient service delivery, while ensuring that Ontario's tradition of watershed-based resource management is maintained and strengthened in the years to come," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

In celebration of the 50th anniversary, the ACAO is planning events and activities over the next six months.<P>
