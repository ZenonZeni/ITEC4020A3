<BR>This Issue: ROGER JAHNKE, O.M.D., on Healing Cancer with Qigong
</CENTER></P>
<HR>

<H3>Question: What's the relationship between Qi and cancer? </H3>

There is a profound medicine
within you. You can turn on and actually feel it. This is Qi, or subtle
life energy. I define Qi (pronounced chee) as a natural internal
self-healing resource. The presence of healthy Qi is obvious: it is what
produces radiance and vitality. Its absence is also obvious: fatigue, pain,
and disease. Qigong means to work with or cultivate this Qi using a set of
exercises, postures, and movements. 
<P>Qigong practice includes the 3
Regulations-posture, breath,  and mind. These have a positive effect on the
status or quality of your Qi. If it is deficient, Qigong will help you
gather more Qi from the environment and to circulate this energy in your
body. If the Qi is stuck or blocked, Qigong will mobilize it, get it moving
again. Chinese medicine says these two conditions (Qi that is deficient or
not moving) are the two primary causes for most diseases. 
<P>Further, Qigong
helps you to store the Qi in the bone marrow, which, in Western physiology,
is where  immune cells are produced. Obviously, anybody with a cancer
diagnosis needs to enhance the bone marrow's ability to produce more immune
cells.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Question: How does Chinese medicine define cancer?</H3> 
In cancer, there is either a
pervasive "toxic state," such as metastasized cancer, or "toxic
accumulations," which are tumors. The cancer patient's Qi has become
severely disordered; it can no longer optimally maintain and support the
body's functioning. In my 20 years of experience as a practitioner of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, I have seen Qigong both palliate and reverse
cancer. There is a great body of Qigong practice that is brought directly
to bear on cancer, especially a form called Guo Lin Qigong, named after a
now famous Qigong teacher. Madame Guo Lin had cancer, used Western
medicine, and was near death. Then she found that by adapting Qigong forms
she had learned from her grandparents, she was able to resolve her cancer
in a dramatic way.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Question: What happens, physiologically, when you practice Qigong?</H3> 
In the
practice of Qigong, there are many physiological mechanisms at work. First,
Qigong accelerates oxygen distribution in the body at a time when your
muscles are not rapidly using it as they would be in aerobics or running.
This enables cells to begin their repair work. Second, there is a
tremendous benefit to the immune system. Qigong shifts the body into a
state where the autonomic nervous system moves toward
parasympathetic-sympathetic balance, which then supports and enhances the
activities of the immune system. Third, Qigong helps to turn on the body's
"garbage disposal system" known as the lymph, thereby eliminating toxins,
metabolites, and pathogenic factors from the tissues. You can see in
Western physiological terms that there is a profound medicinal effect
created in the human body by doing these practices. 
<P>A 50-year-old woman
with breast cancer told me that when she did Qigong, the tumor would get
hot, then it would cool off when she stopped practicing. She feels
emphatically that these practices helped to sustain her health. Another
woman with cervical cancer said when she did Qigong, her metabolism seemed
to change for the better and immediately bring her inner peace. These are
literally  physiological responses. When you modify the movement, breath,
and mind in Qigong, you mobilize an array of internal physiological
resources. Both women were saying, in effect: I can actually feel this
medicine inside me turning on when I do Qigong.

<HR>
<H3>Question: Is there evidence
that Qigong has a positive effect on cancer?</H3> 
There is now considerable
scientific research in China proving the effectiveness of Qigong as a
cancer treatment. In one study, 122 cancer patients (51 of whom had
malignancies) practiced Qigong in a training class for 22 days. The
researchers found that there were "curative effects" with both benign and
malignant cancers and that the longer the patients practiced the exercises,
the stronger the benefits. They also noted that Qigong helped the survivors
live better and it enabled the 17 patients who eventually died, to do so
without suffering.

<HR WIDTH=85%>

<P>In a study involving 32 patients who practiced Qigong
and underwent chemotherapy, physicians noted no deterioration in their
health; some showed better health than previously, including a stable white
blood cell count. After a man with advanced throat cancer practiced Qigong
in conjunction with chemotherapy, his symptoms cleared up; no cancer cells
could be found through biopsy and he remained cancer-free for the next 8
years, when his case was published. A study of 65 cancer patients at the
Shanghai Qigong Institute showed that Qigong practice improved their rate
of new immune cell production. For cancer patients at the start of the
study, their rate was 27 compared to 76 for healthy, noncancerous patients;
but after 3 months of Qigong, the cancer patients' rate had climbed to 42.

<P>Finally, scientists at the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine College,
who have run a cancer rehabilitation clinic since 1987, stated that after 6
months' treatment with Qigong, sometimes chemotherapy or radiation, and
usually with Chinese herbs and psychological counseling, "most of the
cancer patients have a relatively good curative effect." The rate of cancer
recurrence diminished, the immune activity of "natural killer cells"
increased, appetite and confidence were enhanced, and the negative effects
of chemotherapy and radiation were reduced.
<P>
<HR><A NAME="heartburn"> </A>
<H3>Question: How long must I practice Qigong to get good results?</H3> 
I find that
if I teach a patient a specific practice and it's hard for her to do or she
doesn't bond with it in her imagination, the results will be disappointing.
But if you help a person to find general practices she likes and will do
regularly, that's the winner. Every person is unique, so the Qigong
practices must be tailored to each case. 
<P>If you're able, do Qigong for at
least one 30-60 minute daily session, or even several times, if possible.
If you're too ill or weak, then build up to this gradually. Generally, you
need to apply yourself in a vigilant and persevering manner until you
experience the benefits. I had a patient who had constant heartburn for 22
years. She did Qigong once a week for a month, cured it, then hardly
practiced anymore. Some cases need lifelong practice. My multiple sclerosis
patients will probably do Qigong for the rest of their lives because they
know that when they do it they are multiplying and accelerating the
potential to keep their symptoms in remission.

<P>In China there is a
marvelous organization called the Cancer Recovery Association with millions
of members. They get together every day in small groups in thousands of
locations to practice Qigong and encourage each other. They sing "Happy
Birthday" on the anniversary of each person's cancer diagnosis. On my most
recent trip to China, I met a man celebrating the 30th anniversary of his
cancer diagnosis-he was about 80, looked very healthy, and obviously had
survived his cancer.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Question: Is there a simple exercise I can do to feel the Qi?</H3> 
The Chinese
call this "spontaneous Qigong." Stand with your feet  shoulder-width apart,
your knees slightly bent, your spine upright, shoulders relaxed. Start to
flex or bounce at the knees; then, still bouncing, shift your weight back
and forth from your right to left legs. Keep your breath deep, full, and
relaxed. Begin to snap all of your fingers, flipping each one past your
thumbs. Then, still bouncing and finger-snapping, twist at your waist, to
the right, then to the left. Keep doing all this, plus as you exhale, make
it a sigh of relief. Do 5 of these sighs in a slow and relaxed manner. Now
close your eyes, turn your attention inward, and feel that buzzing,
humming, or tingling sensation that's in your hands, legs, and body. This
is Qi. You are literally feeling the activity of the profound medicine you
have produced within yourself.
