<CENTER>1995 CEC CONVENTION!!<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
It was great to see everyone who was able to attend the CEC Convention in Indy!  The PAN meeting provided all with a sense of where we are and where we are going.  PAN Coordinators continue to work on meeting with U.S. Senators and Representatives in their home districts.  PLEASE REMEMBER TO SEND IN YOUR REPORTING SHEETS!<P>
<CENTER>FY 1995 RESCISSIONS<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Upon returning from their April recess, the House and Senate have turned their attention back to the FY 1995 rescission package.  The House and Senate conferees on H.R. 1158 met on May 2 for a pro forma meeting and will meet again the week of May 8 to try to reach a compromise between their two very different rescission bills.  The rescission bills would go back into the FY 1995 program accounts and cut funding.  The House bill would cut $1.7 billion from education programs and the Senate bill would cut $405 million from education programs.  However, <B>as passed by both the House and the Senate, $4.6 million would be rescinded from the FY 1995 funds for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act.<P>
</B>We urge all CEC-PAN Coordinators to contact the conferees identified in our alert to communicate our opposition to cuts in any education program and especially in the Javits gifted program.  As the only federal program designed to address the education of gifted and talented children, the Javits program fulfills an important role in meeting the needs of our students.  <P>
CEC has written a letter to the conferees (for a copy call CEC at (703) 264-9498, and refer to the May PAN-O-GRAM).  The conference is expected to be long because of the differences between the two  bills.  Some are speculating whether any agreement will be able to be reached.  We will continue to keep you updated as the rescission package moves forward (or hopefully STOPS!). <P>
<CENTER>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA, PART 1<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Congress is beginning efforts to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act this year.  On May 9th, there is a kick-off joint House and Senate hearing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Education of all Handicapped Children Act, which later became IDEA.  Expected to testify are those staffers and advocates who helped craft the original legislation.  CEC's own Fred Weintraub, Assistant Executive Director for Publications will be testifying on CEC's role in the initial legislation.<P>
Following the May 9th hearing, the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy will hold an extensive hearing on IDEA on May 11th.  Those testifying will include students with disabilities, parents, and teachers.  We are pleased to have both Matty Rodriguez-Walling and Sharon Gonder, former Clarissa Hug Teachers of the Year testifying on the importance of special education and regular education collaboration, and the need for training and support for teachers.   Another Senate hearing on the reauthorization of  IDEA is scheduled for the 16th of May.  Testifying will be administrators, researchers and others.  The Senate is planning on developing their reauthorization bill in the fall, with passage before Thanksgiving.  In the meantime, they expect to pass an extension bill to ensure programs under IDEA with continue to be authorized after the October 1 deadline.  <P>
The House has not yet scheduled hearings on IDEA other than the joint hearing on May 9th.  House staff  have indicated they plan on having hearings in June, have a bill reported to the full committee by the August recess and hope to pass their bill by October 1.  The House bill is expected to focus on measurable achievements of students receiving services, greater parental involvement, reducing litigation by offering alternative ways to settle disputes, and consolidating discretionary programs.<P>
<CENTER>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA, PART 2<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The Administration has released its second "Vision Paper" outlining their recommendations for the reauthorization of IDEA.  The paper includes recommendations such as:<P>
*     replacing the current eligibility definition with the functional definition "a child who has a physical or mental impairment and who by reason there of requires special education";<BR>
<BR>
*     changing the formula for State Grants to provide funds beyond the FY 1995 level to States on the basis of total number of children in the State;  <BR>
<BR>
*     including children with disabilities in State and district assessments, with few exceptions;<BR>
<BR>
*     amending the IEP to: <P>
     -     include the student's achievement in relation to the general curriculum and include a statement of the services needed to be provided to students with  disabilities in order to attain the annual objectives or participation in the general curriculum;<BR>
<BR>
     -     replace short-term objectives with measurable annual objectives;<BR>
<BR>
     -     amending the IEP to require at least one regular education teacher participate in the IEP meeting; and<BR>
<BR>
     -     require transition planning beginning at age 14.<BR>
<BR>
*     modify regulations governing initial and triennial evaluation to increase focus on instructionally relevant information;<BR>
<BR>
*     allowing school districts to provide special education services in the regular classroom without having to track whether benefits might accrue to non-disabled students as long as certain conditions are met;   and<BR>
<BR>
*     consolidate the 14 discretionary programs into five programs: Research to Practice, Technology Development and Media Services, Parent Training, Professional Development, and State Improvement Activities.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration is expected to submit a legislative proposal in early June.  For a copy of the Vision Paper, call CEC at (703) 264-9498, and refer to the May PAN-O-GRAM.    <P>
<CENTER>OSEP'S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE DISCIPLINE ISSUE<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The much awaited <I>Questions and Answers on Disciplining Children with Disabilities</I> was released by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) on April 27.  The paper is meant to clarify what school districts can do to discipline children with disabilities and comply with the protections under IDEA.<P>
The document answers sixteen questions ranging from "What steps should school districts take to address misconduct when it first appears?" to "What immediate steps can school districts take to remove a student with a disability who brings a firearm to school?"  The paper also addresses amendments made to IDEA in the Improving America's Schools Act last year that amends the "stay put" provision to allow students with disabilities to be placed in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 days if they have brought a firearm to school.  OSERS have interpreted the 45 days to mean 45 <I>calendar </I>days.   For a copy of the document, call CEC at (703) 264-9498, and refer to the May PAN-O-GRAM.<BR>
