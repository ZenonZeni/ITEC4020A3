<H1>The Toronto and Ottawa 
conferences<BR>
and the "Law of the Atmosphere"</H1>
<HR>
<B>The 1988 Toronto Conference called for a "comprehensive international 
framework that can address the interrelated problems of the global 
atmosphere."</B> Convened by the government of Canada from 27-30 June, the 
Toronto Conference brought together over 300 scientists and policy-makers from 46 
countries and organizations. Unlike most similar international gatherings, the 
"International Conference of the Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security" 
addressed climatic change together with the closely related problems of ozone layer 
depletion and the long-range transport of toxic and acidifying substances. It concluded 
that, although some steps had been taken to develop international law for protecting the 
atmosphere, the existing rules were still relatively fragmentary.<P>
<B>The Conference Statement noted that "humanity is conducting an unintended, 
uncontrolled, globally pervasive experiment whose ultimate consequences could be 
second only to a global nuclear war."</B>1 Stressing the importance of immediate 
action, the Statement called for the adoption of an Action Plan for the Protection of the 
Atmosphere and the establishment of a World Atmosphere Fund to finance its 
implementation. The Action Plan should include an international framework convention on 
the atmosphere as well as national legislation and action plans. The Statement also 
outlined the scientific basis for concern, the economic and social concerns, and the legal 
aspects of the problems.<P>
<B>The Conference issued an ambitious "call for action" to governments, industry, 
and international organizations.</B> Among its recommendations were: 1) the 
reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20% of 1988 levels  by the year 2005. 
Recommended as an initial global goal,  this goes  beyond the emissions targets 
recommended by most later  international conferences as well as the tentative target set by 
the 1992 <A HREF = "fs250.html">UN Framework Convention 
on Climate Change</A>; 2) the improvement of energy efficiency by as much as 10% by 
the year 2005;    3) the inception of the necessary technological changes to enable these 
goals to be reached; 4) the preparation of the principles and components of a framework 
treaty for the protection of the atmosphere (including climate change, ozone depletion, 
and atmospheric pollution) in time for the 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED)</A>; and 5) the promotion of <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change</A> (the IPCC had been established shortly before the Toronto Conference), the 
channelling of resources to the World Climate Programme (WCP) and other research 
institutions, the backing of technology transfer, the reduction of deforestation, and the 
furtherance of public awareness of these issues.<P>
<B>The 1989 Ottawa Meeting of Legal and Policy Experts generated ideas for 
treaties on the atmosphere and on climate change.</B> Held from 20-22 February  as 
a follow-up to the Toronto Conference, the meeting was attended by around 80 legal and 
policy experts acting in a personal capacity, including officials from governments, 
non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions around the world. Its goal was 
to further develop the idea of a "law of the atmosphere treaty" and a narrower convention 
on climate change. The non-binding statement adopted by the meeting2 amounted to 
rough drafts of such treaties. Both drafts contain some interesting and innovative 
ideas.<P>
<B>The "law of the atmosphere" plan tackled not only climate change, but every 
threat to the global atmosphere.</B> This contrasts with proposals made by other 
international conferences and was criticized as being over-ambitious. Although the plan 
was discussed in various international meetings, it was not taken up by the climate treaty 
negotiators. The 1992 <A HREF = "fs250.html">UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change</A> focuses exclusively on climate change. 
This was generally considered to be a more realistic approach with a greater chance of 
leading to a treaty within a reasonable period of time. <P>
<B>The proposed "law of the atmosphere" convention would have created a very 
broad framework for dealing comprehensively with threats to the atmosphere. 
</B>These threats include climate change, ozone depletion, and acid rain, as well as any 
other problems that might arise in the future. Borrowing the approach taken by the 1982 
Law of the Seas Convention, some participants proposed that conventions and protocols 
on specific issues such as climate change be elaborated within this general framework. The 
Ottawa Meeting’s proposed "law of the atmosphere" convention would have included: 1) 
broad definitions of "atmosphere" and "atmospheric interference";  2) the obligation on 
the part of all states to protect the atmosphere, notwithstanding the sovereignty of states 
in the management of their own resources; 3) a provision that measures taken to protect 
the atmosphere should not lead to damage   of other parts of the environment; 4) the 
development and transfer of technology, especially for the benefit of developing countries; 
5) prior notice to other states, and environmental impact assessment, of potentially 
harmful activities; 6) the elaboration of a regime for liability and   compensation and for 
dispute settlement; and 7) the possible establishment of a World Atmospheric Trust Fund 
to assist developing countries.<P>
<B>The proposed climate treaty was to be a framework treaty with protocols. 
</B>Like <A HREF = "fs224.html">the Vienna Convention on 
the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol</A>, the proposed treaty 
would have dealt with fundamental issues while leaving specific issues to protocols. 
Possible protocols could address the various greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, 
CFCs and halons, nitrous oxide, and tropospheric ozone), forest management and 
reforestation, and the setting up of a World Climate Trust Fund to help developing 
countries meet their obligations under the treaty system. The "framework treaty" approach 
also underlies the 1992 Climate Convention.<P>
