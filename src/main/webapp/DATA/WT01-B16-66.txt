<P>
There are proven and safe technologies for managing medium and low level waste, and for storing high level long-lived waste for long enough for heat output and radioactivity from it to have reduced enough to simplify final disposal greatly.  These technologies have existed and been used since the early 1970s. The physical facilities for the last stage of managing high level and long-lived waste - final disposal - were not built, because there was no urgent technological need for them and there was well grounded confidence in the potential for a safe solution when needed. 
<P>
However, the lack of defined plans for the long term management of this waste, reinforced by lack of public understanding of the very significant differences in the potential hazard from different types of radioactive waste, has had an important effect on public confidence in the handling of all radioactive waste, not just high level and long-lived waste. 
<P>
Later, long term safety assessments extended the criteria for management according to the principle that risks we are not prepared to accept today should not be passed on to future generations.  The demand made next that the waste should be guaranteed never to cause any harm whatever to the environment, however small and unlikely, was not expected.  This demand had not been imposed on any activities before, and it seems desirable that the consequences of the profound effect on all present technology if it were extended to the rest of industry and other human activities, should be carefully considered. 
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, major efforts have been put into defining long term nuclear waste management policy.  It is almost certain that more effort and resources have been devoted to finding an acceptable and safe disposal route for radioactive wastes than for any other kind of waste.  At present, disposal of radioactive waste is subject to far more stringent controls than have yet been introduced for other waste, even where this other waste is permanently highly toxic. 
<P>
Today, there is broad theoretical and practical knowledge on the answers to all the important questions about radioactive waste management. 
<P>
The theoretical knowledge is backed up by experience of processes comparable to those that will occur in the repository and by study of analogous natural systems, such as the 2000 million year old deposit of natural spent fuel at Oklo in Gabon or the extremely rich uranium ore immobilized in a natural clay backfill at Cigar Lake in Canada. 
<P>
Research and development, nationally and internationally, have been intensified, and the results show that the industry has the knowledge to build facilities that will isolate waste where necessary for a long time ahead and also under drastically changed conditions.  Countries are ready with the technology to build and operate facilities when they are needed. 
<P>
In France, Canada, the UK and the USA, shallow land burial has been used almost as long as nuclear production.  A modern variant taking advantage of experience and technological progress is near surface disposal in engineered structures. This is now being implemented or planned more widely, for example in Spain and Japan.
<P>
Underground facilities are also in existence.  In Germany, low and intermediate waste has been disposed of on an industrial scale in two former salt mines, Asse (R&amp;D facility) and Morsleben.  The bulk of this waste is now in intermediate storage facilities, and is intended to be finally disposed of in the abandoned Konrad iron ore mine, which is in an advanced stage of licensing.  In Sweden, a permanent repository for intermediate and low level waste has been operating since 1988, and in Finland construction has begun.  In the USA, construction of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico, has been completed.  It is an R&amp;D facility to demonstrate safe disposal of transuranic wastes in a deep salt formation.  The test phase with waste is to begin by the end of July 1991.
