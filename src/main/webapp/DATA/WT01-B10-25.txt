<h2>The Emotional Effects of Infertility on the Couple Relationship</h2><p>
Men and women are affected by infertility in different ways. Most couples experience the struggle in much the same way.  This is related to the traditional ways men and women have been trained to think, feel, and act.<p>
Women are typically seen (by others as well as themselves) as the emotional caretakers or providers of the relationship.  Women typically feel responsible not only for everyone's bad feelings, but also for anything bad that happens.<p>
Women in infertile couples often protect their husbands from their own pain and feelings of failure by taking much of the responsibility for the treatments upon themselves.  When I suggest that men accompany their wives for appointments, couples get concerned about issues like income loss, use of time, etc.  While these concerns are usually relevant and important, they also serve the purpose of protecting husbands from their own responsibility (taking part in the conception process) and from their own feelings, which could easily be intensified by so much contact with the medical process.<p>
Men are seen, traditionally, as the financial providers of the relationship and are responsible for protecting the family from real or imagined dangers.  They are trained to be more instructional: to take charge, to make decisions, and to think without being sidetracked by emotions.<p>
Males in infertile couples often feel overwhelmed by the intensity of the woman's emotions as well as an inability to access their own.  They tend to focus their energy back into their work, a place where they feel they can have more success.<p>
As a result of taking responsibility for the emotional impact of the infertility, the woman experiences intense feelings:  pain, anger, fear, etc. which, combined with the messages that her way of dealing with things is in some way dysfunctional or "crazy", causes her to feel an anxious depression.<p>
As feelings spill out, she feels out of control and doesn't really know how to ask for what she needs, especially from the husband she is struggling so hard to protect.  She may yearn for an emotional connection/interaction at one moment, and in the next, withdraw emotionally from her husband when she fears she has overwhelmed him.<p>
Men find themselves in a position where, no matter how well they've been trained to solve problems, they are helpless to make this situation better for the woman and, as a result, may give off messages that she is "too" emotional or sensitive, hoping that this will calm her down.<p>
The wife hears this as criticism of her coping and caretaking skills rather than as an  expression of her husband's fears.  Many couples I've worked with have described this painful cycle.<p>
This is the time when couples cling together for dear life, feeling that they've failed in the most basic of all roles: that of reproduction.  Couples are hesitant to admit the problems in their marriage, feeling that having problems coping would indicate that their marriage too is a failure.<p>
The questions then arise: how to get what you need from your partner...How to be there for your partner?<p>
Obviously, more open communication helps;  getting in touch with what you're feeling will help you know what you need.  Then you can clearly and specifically tell your partner how to give it to you.  Ask your partner what she/he needs rather than assuming that you can't give it.<p>
Recognize the differences between men and women so it doesn't always feel like your partner is withholding what you need.  (Read Intimate Strangers by Lilian Rubin).<p>
Share more in the process of treatment and see if you can't teach each other some of the skills you've learned from your years as a man and as a woman.<p>
As you share the burdens and joys of your different perceptions/experiences of infertility, it will help to balance the intensity and bring you closer with a deeper respect for each other.<p><hr>
