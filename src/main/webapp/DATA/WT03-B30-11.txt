issuing this Notice of Contract Action. Non-foreign sources are 
sought to provide non-personal manpower support services in a 
variety of engineering technical and acquisition management 
disciplines at Eglin AFB FL and other related locations, as 
required. The current TEAS contract F08635-91-C-0002, awarded 03 
Jan 91, is scheduled to expire 16 March 1996. The estimated ceiling 
level of performance is 420 manyears of Members of the Technical

chargeable to tasks, it does not include subprofessionals or 
overhead personnel. The estimated ceiling for Technical Support 
Staff (subprofessionals and overhead personnel) is not to exceed 
25% of the MTS manhours. The TEAS contract incorporates modern 
research, design, development and test practices into the system 
acquisition process for a wide range of munitions systems related

TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONCRETE FLOORS - AN ENGINEERING STUDY
SOL HCET009 DUE 013096. Poc D. M.A. Ebadian, (305) 348-2569, Joe 
Boudreaux (305) 348-3727. The Hemispheric Center for Environmental 
Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) is seeking 
qualified suppliers to conduct an engineering study for the comparative 
analysis of surface removal decontamination technologies for concrete 
floors. The study is being performed to support the U.S. Department of 
Energy. The study will be conducted at the campus of FIU in Miami, 
Florida. Each technology will be tested by removing one inch of 
concrete from a coated and a noncoated concrete floor. The operating 
time will provide sufficient time to collect the operational and safety 
information required to evaluate each technology. Additional data will 
be collected on the capital costs, maintenance costs, and equipment 
staging/destaging costs. The surrogate includes concrete pad twenty 
feet by forty feet surrounded by a six inch high dike. Half of this 
area (twenty feet by twenty feet) will be coated with epoxy urethane. 
The surrogate will not be radiologically contaminated.  The 
technologies for inclusion in the study are: ultra high pressure water 
(greater than or equal to 15,000 pounds per square inch (psi)), 
milling, scabbling, centrifugal shot blasting, and steel grit blasting. 
The qualified suppliers will be asked to optimize the operation of the 
technology as it is applied to each surrogate. The qualified firms 
shall have five years minimum experience in nuclear decontamination and 
two years minimum operations experience with the given technology. The 
qualified firms are to provide references of nuclear decontamination 
jobs completed. Qualified firms shall also state the maximum depth of 
concrete removal in a single application. Interested firms should send 
a Letter of Qualification stating how the firm meets the minimum 
requirements, including address, contact, telephone and fax numbers to 
the attention of Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology at 
Florida International University, Attention Dr. M.A.  Ebadian, 
Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering and Design 
University Park, Miami, Florida 33199 no later than 1/30/96. The 
letters of qualification will be used to prequalify proposed firms. The 
RFP will be available to the qualified firms approximately February 15, 
1996. (360)
