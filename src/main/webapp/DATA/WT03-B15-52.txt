<P>Torture in Kenya has been a subject of Amnesty International concerns for years. This report
presents worrying new evidence of torture, ill-treatment and the denial of medical care to
prisoners in Kenya. The pattern of abuses documented by human rights groups throughout the 1980s
and early 1990s appears to be continuing.

<P>Torture and ill-treatment by the security forces is widespread. Criminal suspects are
routinely tortured to extract confessions, as are some political prisoners. Well-known political
prisoners are harassed and ill-treated. Defendants are frequently held in custody beyond the
legal limit and this is rarely challenged by the courts. Investigations into allegations of
torture by the police are rare -- prosecutions rarer still -- and many police officers appear to
act with impunity. Those charged are held on remand, often for many years, in extremely harsh
conditions before coming to trial. Many prisoners suffer serious illness as a result of torture
or prison conditions but are often refused medical treatment or receive it very late. Doctors who
attempt to treat political prisoners are harassed by the police, prison officers and prison
medical personnel.

<P>Torture methods are frequently very brutal, usually beating with sticks, fists, rungus
(knobbed sticks), handles of hoes and gun butts on different parts of the body. The most common
torture is to beat the soles of the feet where bruises may disappear rapidly but where the pain
inflicted can remain for the rest of the person's life. Detainees are often tortured by being
suspended upside down on a stick passed behind their knees and in front of their elbows and then
beaten on the soles of their feet. One variation used is simultaneous blows to both ears, which
is extremely painful and can rupture the ear drums.

<P>Some political detainees have been tortured even more severely. Some have had their
fingernails and toenails pulled out. Cases of near-asphyxiation have also been reported where
prisoners have been submerged head first in dirty water. Some have been held in cells filled
with two inches of water for several days. Others have been taken to a forest at night, suspended
from the trees and then beaten. Both men and women have been subjected to violent forms of sexual
humiliation. Women have been raped and have had objects, such as bottles, inserted into their
vaginas. Men have been tortured by having their genitals pricked with large pins or tied with
string and pulled.

<P>In the past, the Kenyan government has responded to criticism of  its human rights record by
making largely cosmetic changes, with little lasting effect. Without significant international
pressure Kenya is unlikely to prevent torture and police brutality in the future nor adequately
address current allegations of human rights violations by the security forces. Many of these
violations are being raised by Kenyan human rights activists and NGOs who need the protection of
the international community if they are to continue to challenge their government's human rights
record. Without effective action serious human rights violations will continue.

<P>Amnesty International calls on the Kenyan government to implement the extensive
recommendations at the end of this report. The organization believes that, if effectively
implemented, these recommendations will help to end the pattern of human rights violations in
Kenya.

<P>This summarizes a 31-page document (12,879 words), Kenya: Torture, compounded by the denial of
medical care (AI Index: AFR 32/18/95), issued by Amnesty International in December 1995. Anyone
wanting further details or to take action on this issue should consult the full document.
