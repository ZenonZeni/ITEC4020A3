<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Turning Retirement Dreams into
Reality</STRONG></FONT><P>
Mark Twain once commented that everybody loves to talk about the
weather, but
unfortunately
no one does anything about it.  His quip would seem to apply equally
well to
retirement
planning.  Consider the following statistics:<P>

According to a 1994 Princeton Survey Research Associates' survey, "Concerns of Adults in Their
Pre-Retirement Years," the overwhelming majority of men and women aged 45 to 59 are unprepared for a
financially comfortable retirement.  In fact, 85% of those surveyed anticipate that they will not have
enough
to retire at all, or will have just enough to get by.<P>

In addition, the 1994 survey by the Princeton Survey Research Associates indicates that the situation
is
getting worse.  The rate of retirement savings is actually declining.  It dropped 8% from 1993 to 1994
and
was down a total of 34% over a three-year period. A report by the benefits consulting firm of
Goodwins,
Booke and Dickenson stated that a third of all baby boomers have less than $10,000 saved.<P>

Perhaps most seriously, many people aren't doing much about their own retirement needs.  In fact, the
majority of Americans seem to be ignoring the situation.  According to figures reported in <I>The
Kiplinger
Washington Letter</I> (July 1, 1994), about one in five households has no savings whatsoever.  Of
those
that do, the median amount is just $10,000.<P>

Don't count on too much help from the government.  At best, Social
Security will
contribute
only a part of the monthly income you need.  The current monthly
maximum is less
than $1,250 for someone age 65 retiring in 1996, who has never been disabled.

It's likely that even this level of benefits will have
been shrunk by the time fifty-year olds reach retirement age.  And don't forget how
Medicare
benefits have changed over the years.  You'd do best to think of
government
benefits as a
bonus to your retirement plan, not as a substitute.<P>
Begin at the end:  What do you want to do during your retirement?  How
do you
envision your
retirement lifestyle?  Now assign an approximate dollar value to that
lifestyle: 
given your
(1) current wealth, (2) income, (3) savings, and (4) rate of savings,
how much of
your
retirement dream will you be able to afford?	This initial approach
is admittedly
the most
sobering and least fun part of retirement planning.  Here you are
likely to
discover that
your future dreams and current means may be, shall we say, more than a
little bit
out of
synch.<P>
The question is, must you adjust your dreams to your means, or can you
manage those
means to
realize your dreams?  At a minimum, the resources available to you upon
retirement
should be
sufficient to (1) provide adequate retirement income and (2) fund
desired bequests. 
Other
important long-term goals, such as meeting educational and other
dependent needs,
must also
be considered.<P>
Retirement planning focuses on what can be done today to realize
long-term
financial goals. 
It is not a one-time act, but many related ones: budgeting, saving,
investing,
income tax
planning, dependent needs planning, and estate planning.  These
endeavors revolve
around one
main consideration - the very essence of retirement planning - namely,
taking
action to
accelerate the growth of wealth.  What can you do to realize your
retirement
dreams?  What
can you do to increase the growth of your wealth?<P>
The most obvious way to increase wealth is to increase income. 
Planning
constraints can
often be eased by an increase in salary, whether this is achieved by
negotiating a
raise,
assuming additional responsibilities, or training for a more lucrative
position. 
Some
professionals might consider part-time self-employment.  Employment or
self-employment income
earned by other family members can also make a significant contribution
to
retirement
savings.<P>
Adhering to a well-conceived and disciplined budget allows you to
better anticipate
how much
money you'll have for retirement purposes, and how you can allocate it. 
Budgeting
also
enables you to control interest (debt) expenses.  You can increase your
income by
repaying
any credit card or life insurance loan debts.<P>
You should also make a firm commitment to "forced savings":  Take
maximum advantage
of your
firm's 401(k), T.S.A., S.E.P., or other qualified pension plan. 
Purchasing cash
value life
insurance is another not-to-be-overlooked method of forced savings.<P>
One more suggestion:  Take a good a look at your taxes.  Tax planning
lets you
reduce tax
liabilities - a worthy goal in itself - and also enhances your
investment
options.<P>
The first way to increase your wealth through investments is simply to
allocate
more of your
assets to investments.  You've go to play to win, and you've got to
invest to
prosper.  By
increasing the amount you invest relative to your personal and liquid
assets, you
improve the
weighted average return on your assets.  By diversifying your
investment portfolio,
you
reduce its risk exposure.   By assuming intelligent risks, you improve
the
long-term total
return on your investments.  Investing more intelligently, and more
profitably, is
made
possible with mutual funds.  Funds offer professional management of
your invested
dollars, as
well as diversification across country, industry, and company lines,
and between
types of
securities.  "Money makes money," said Ben Franklin, "and the money
that money
makes, makes
more money."  In the end, there are but two (legal) ways to increase
wealth - you
can work
for it and you can put it to work for you.  You can earn, and you can
invest. 
These two ways
to increase wealth are not alternatives but complements.  Indeed, the
better job
you do
making money - maximizing income and controlling expenses - the greater
are your
options in
making that money make more money for you.<P>
	Mark Twain aside, you can't do anything about the weather. 
Retirement, too, is
inevitable, but you can do something about it.  Start planning now.
