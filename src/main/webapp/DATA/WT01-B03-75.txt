<h2 align=center>Technical Description of the Rosen Motors<br>
Hybrid Electric Powertrain</h2>
<p align=center><a href="/ptdiag.htm"><img src="/controls/rmbpd.gif" align=bottom border=0 width=100 height=30></a> </p>
<p>The internal combustion engine, the principal component of today's automotive powertrain, has been used to power 
automobiles for over 100 years. But this one source of power creates undesirable compromises: high-power engines provide 
high acceleration but poor fuel economy, while low-power engines provide better fuel economy but poor acceleration 
performance. In addition, noxious emissions are an unavoidable byproduct of operation.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the internal combustion engine, the Rosen Motors hybrid electric powertrain offers the capability to obtain 
<em>simultaneously</em> high acceleration, high fuel economy, and nearly zero emissions. The Rosen Motors powertrain consists of a 
turbogenerator, a flywheel motor-generator, an electric drive motor, and an electronic control system.</p>
<p>The heat engine for the powertrain is a gas turbine, which powers a generator (together, referred to as a <em>turbogenerator</em>). It is 
used to satisfy the relatively low average power demands of the vehicle, while the flywheel driven motor-generator is used to 
supply the surge power demands of the motor vehicle, as well as to recover power from regenerative braking.</p>
<p>In the Rosen Motors hybrid electric powertrain, only the electric drive motor connects directly to the drivetrain of the vehicle. 
Unlike many other hybrid concepts, it is not simply a &quot;range extender&quot; for a chemical battery-powered vehicle. Rather, the 
electronic controller dynamically selects the blend of flywheel-generated and turbine-generated power that provides the 
optimum vehicle performance at all points in the driving cycle.</p>
<h3>Turbogenerator</h3>
<p>The turbogenerator is the fuel burning engine of the powertrain. It burns unleaded gasoline in its catalytic combustor, producing 
virtually zero pollutants.</p>
<p>The rotor of the generator, the compressor wheel, the turbine wheel and the shaft comprise the rotating group. This rotating 
group, the single moving part of the turbogenerator, is supported by self-pumping air bearings. The cooling for the 
turbogenerator is provided by the inlet air flow, so there is no need for liquid cooling. The turbogenerator requires no 
lubrication and no regularly-scheduled maintenance, except for occasional changings of the air filter.</p>
<p>A recuperator is used to improve the efficiency of the turbogenerator. The turbogenerator itself is controlled by feedback 
loops to the speed and inlet temperature that corresponds to its highest efficiency for the particular power demand.</p>
<p>The turbogenerator for the Rosen Motors powertrain is supplied by <a href="http://www.capstoneturbine.com/">Capstone Turbine Corporation</a>, which also builds 
turbogenerators for stationary power generation. In the current Rosen Motors experimental vehicle, the turbogenerator 
provides up to 24 kilowatts of electrical output at 30 percent thermal efficiency. A turbogenerator having a maximum power 
output of 45 kilowatts will be used in future Rosen Motors powertrains.</p>
<h3>Flywheel</h3>
<p>The flywheel-motor-generator combination provides surge power for the hybrid electric vehicle and provides energy storage 
that allows for regenerative braking. It performs these functions with more efficiency, at a much lower weight and with a much 
longer useful life than chemical batteries.</p>
<p>The flywheel rotating assembly consists of a carbon filament-wound composite cylinder and ring, a titanium hub and a steel 
shaft. The rotor of the motor-generator and the rotating elements of the flywheel magnetic bearing assemblies are mounted on 
the shaft and supported by the magnetic bearings.</p>
<p>Due to the extremely high speeds at the surface of the cylinder, the rotating assembly must be contained in a vacuum enclosure. 
The continuously evolving residual gases from the enclosure are pumped by a molecular drag pump into a second 
higher-pressure chamber containing molecular sieves.</p>
<p>The stator of the flywheel motor-generator is cooled by passing coolant through a jacket which surrounds the stator. (This 
liquid also cools the stators of the magnetic bearings.) The rotor of the motor-generator is cooled by radiation, primarily to the 
stator.</p>
<p>The spin axis of the rotor is controlled to a vertical orientation. The vacuum housing is supported by a two-axis gimbal system, 
which isolates the rotor from vehicular angular motions.</p>
<p>The vacuum housing is surrounded by a containment system which prevents escape of the rotor material in the unlikely event of 
an accidental burst of the flywheel rotor.</p>
<p>The flywheel is designed for a long self-discharge time, on the order of a thousand hours (about six weeks). In the event the 
flywheel is allowed to run down after long storage without recharge, it can be recharged by the turbine. (In the case of a 
discharged flywheel, the turbine itself would be started by the 12 volt battery.)</p>
<p>At its maximum charge, the flywheel can store one kilowatt-hour of energy, of which 80 percent is available over the flywheel 
operating speed range of 28,000 - 62,000 RPM. (The flywheel <em>quiescent speed</em> -- not braking or accelerating -- is about 
55,000 RPM.) The flywheel motor-generator can deliver or accept energy at a maximum rate of 120 kilowatts. Larger power 
outputs may be used in future Rosen Motors powertrains.</p>
<p>Rosen Motors has seven patents pending, and one patent issued in regard to various aspects of its flywheel motor-generator 
design.</p>
<h3>Drive motor</h3>
<p>The drive motor(s) delivers torque (through a fixed gear reduction) to the drive wheels in response to the positions of the 
accelerator and brake pedals. It also responds to the position of the hand lever, which is used to select forward or reverse.</p>
<p>The field current of the drive motor is adjusted to obtain optimum performance for any driving condition. The electronic 
controller provides a pulse-width controlled signal, whose magnitude depends on the desired speed and torque to the drive 
motor.</p>
<p>The characteristics of an electric drivetrain and the use of a fixed gear reduction result in a vehicle acceleration as smooth -- 
i.e., no gears shifting --as that obtained with a continuously variable transmission. Moreover, maximum torque is provided by 
the drive motor instantaneously. This, in conjunction with the high power flywheel, results in the extraordinarily high 
acceleration characteristics of the vehicle.</p>
<h3>Electronic controller</h3>
<p>The electronic power control consists of the logic, power electronics and software which control the three motor-generators 
(associated with the gasoline turbine, flywheel and drive motor, respectively) in the starting, accelerating, cruising, braking, hill 
climbing and hill descending operations of the motor vehicle. The control of the motor-generators is designed to provide 
excellent fuel economy, high acceleration capability, and minimum use of the friction brakes.</p>
<p>This control is effected by varying the duty cycle of the pulse-width modulator outputs. These outputs switch the 
inverter-rectifiers on and off to synthesize the sinusoidal waveforms for the three motor-generators, all of which (generally) 
operate at different rotational speeds.</p>
<p>Each of the powertrain's motor-generators is connected to a separate inverter-rectifier. The inverter-rectifiers are Insulated 
Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules. The inverter-rectifiers are in turn connected to a common 400 volt d.c. bus. When 
the motor-generator is in the motor mode, the inverter-rectifier acts as an inverter to power the motor; when in the generator 
mode, the inverter-rectifier acts as a rectifier to charge the bus.</p>
<p>The turbogenerator and flywheel are controlled during normal driving with feedback loops, while the drive motor torque 
responds directly to the driver input through the accelerator pedal. The parameters for these control loops are designed to 
maintain the flywheel speed, bus voltage, turbine temperature and turbine speed within their respective operating ranges, while 
providing smooth response to driver input.</p>
<p>Rosen Motors has one patent pending on its electronic controller. </p>
