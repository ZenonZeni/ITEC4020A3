<H3>Is There a Tomorrow for Nuclear Power Generation? <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/kanohbio.html">Tokio Kanoh</A>.</H3>


<P>
Despite negative press reports,  nuclear power generation continues to expand. At end 1994, 425 nuclear reactors were operating in 30 countries, combined capacity being 356 GWe. Since the 
Chernobyl accident, nuclear power generation capacity has increased by 79 GWe net (1986-1994). Much
 of the expansion is in Asia. Energy options adopted in different areas are of three patterns: hydro-rich 
countries; coal-rich countries; and resource-poor countries. Some of the latter use nuclear either as their
 main power source, or as diversification. The trend from NIMBY to PIMBY ('please in my back yard') is
 illustrated with examples from Japan and the Marshall Islands.

<P>
In a Japanese public opinion survey in 1990 on both the safety and  the future of nuclear it was
 revealed that strong opinions at the end of the spectrum account for only 10%. Therefore 90% of the
 population maintain a flexible stance, and it is with  them that positive and negative aspects of nuclear
 should be discussed. Positive aspects are that nuclear is a technology-intensive energy source with minimal
 fuel requirement, facilitating energy security; it is an alternative to oil; and it is compatible with the environment,
 being cleaner even than photovoltaic. Negative aspects are concern about possible accidents; problems with
 radioactive waste; and concern about weapons proliferation.

<P>
Scenarios for the 21st century are presented. Likely prospects up to 2050 are population increase,
 mainly in developing countries; increased energy demand; and international disputes over fossil fuel 
resources. It is predicted that China, at some point in the 21st century, will be consuming three times
 more oil than the US at present. Energy efficiency must therefore be improved, and all fuel resources
 developed. Peter Beck's three scenarios for nuclear in the 21st century are presented: first that there
 will be no new nuclear plants and existing ones phased out; second that nuclear capacity will increase
 from the present 360 million kW to 400 million kW but after 2000 capacity will level off at this figure; third
 that nuclear power development will progress and capacity reach 1.5 billion kW by 2050. We should not wait,
 the author says, to see which one will happen, but choose a scenario and work out strategies to make it happen.

<P>
Finally seven proposals are made for conduct to win public support for nuclear development: firstly nuclear
 power is not a pre-condition, but there should be 'dematerialisation' from a wasteful lifestyle to a recycle-oriented
 society, 'decoupling' to separate increased energy use from economic growth, by energy conservation;
 and 'decarbonisation' or development of non- carbon energy; secondly risk communication based on
 accurate information; thirdly on-going dialogues with opponents of nuclear; fourthly a track record of
 safe and stable nuclear operation; fifthly the 'visibility' i.e., openness of both nuclear facilities and 
nuclear information; sixthly the building of a framework for regional cooperation, especially in Asia; and
 finally the provision of accurate information to the mass media.
