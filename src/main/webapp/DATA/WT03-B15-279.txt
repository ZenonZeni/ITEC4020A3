<H3>How do teachers use the MDM Teacher’s Guide?</H3>



With its robotic multi-media introduction, student retention of the MDM concepts is excellent.  The robot's dramatic delivery and the associated learning materials give teachers and parents an ongoing opportunity to stimulate excitement throughout the school year.  Each live assembly introduces 20 life skills concepts, or <A HREF="learnobj.htm">Learning Objectives</A> to students.



<P>

The MDM curriculum guide given to each teacher contains hundreds of activities that allow students to explore and fulfill each objective.  Activities are grouped in a variety of Teaching Styles to maximize each teacher’s effectiveness and student interest.  The activities were designed to integrate easily with other subjects, such as social studies, language art, science, art and music.



<H3>Is the MDM material suitable for all grade levels?</H3>

Students interpret life skills concepts at their own level of growth.  In the MDM curriculum, activities and worksheets are ungraded to allow teachers to choose the ones that best fit their students' capabilities.  In some cases, teachers assign one activity to part of the class, and a different or less demanding activity to other students.



<H3>How does the MDM program promote healthy growth in children?</H3>

Scientific research indicates that developing life skills plays a vital role in preventing childhood drug use and avoiding other dangerous behavior.  MDM’s live robotic demonstration establishes the human body as a child’s most priceless possession.  Then, MDM guides children to discover the reasons and techniques they need to decide against drug use for themselves.  Drugs become a threat to their well-being rather than an opportunity to "try a new experience" or "get away with something."



<P>

Developing self-esteem and health awareness also motivates children to protect themselves in general.  These self-protection concepts give children the desire and ability to resist many other dangers, such as stealing, risk-taking, violence or sexual misconduct.



<H3>How are learning materials organized?</H3>

Each of the 20 Learning Objectives has two pages of activities and two worksheets.<P>



<IMG SRC="../graphics/bookpic.gif" ALT="Book">



<P>

Each Learning Objective appears on the left hand page under the Section Heading.  A "Note to Teacher" gives a brief overview of the lesson.  The remainder of the first two pages contains a wide selection of activities in a variety of Teaching Styles.  This selection will help you find activities most suited to your students and curriculum requirements.  Boxes ([ ]) are provided for an easy check ([ ]) of completed exercises.



<H3>What Teaching Styles does MDM use?</H3>

MDM uses a variety of Teaching Styles to help students comprehend and retain the material.  For older children in Grades 4-6 the Teaching Styles are:<BR>



<UL>

<H3>Discuss!</H3>

This Teaching Style develops communication and interpersonal skills in the classroom.  A series of related discussion questions gives a complete introduction to each Learning Objective.  Answers are provided for fact-based questions while others allow students to explore their own feelings and opinions.  In most cases, students can deduce the answers and teach themselves and their classmates.



<H3>Investigate!</H3>

Students gather information from books, magazines, records, newspapers, reference sources and (in our next printing!) even CD-ROM libraries, databases and the Internet.  They report their findings and sources in either written or verbal form, as the teacher decides.  In addition to developing independent research, reading and computer skills, teachers find that students are more receptive to information that they locate on their own.

<H3>Create!</H3>



This style develops creative writing skills and artistic expression.  Most of these activities are presented as written assignments.  Teachers may easily adapt  many of them to be art, poetry or music projects.  Occasionally, teachers can invite students to pick their own means of expression.



<H3>Interact!</H3>

This style develops communication and interactive skills both inside and outside the classroom.  Many of these activities involve role play, games or other types of group participation.  Sometimes, a field trip is suggested. Two other types of activities in each Interact section are "Visitor" and "Interview".

<UL>

<P>

<STRONG>"Visitor"</STRONG> activities recommend special guests to invite to speak to the class.  Parents and local professional organizations are recommended sources for speakers.  Teachers explain the Learning Objective and the goal of their lesson to each visitor in advance.<BR>



<P>

<STRONG>"Interview"</STRONG> activities teach students to record and report information acquired from other people.  The subject of the interview might be a parent, guardian, relative, professional, sibling or peer.  Teachers can assign specific people or let students choose their own subjects.  Results are submitted in writing or reported to the class during moderated discussions.<BR>

</UL>



</UL>

<H3>Worksheets</H3>

Each Learning Objective has two dedicated worksheets.  The recommended procedure is for students to complete each worksheet with their parents.  The activities were specifically designed to create entertaining and educational encounters between parents and children.  Each worksheet has a Parent's Initial box to check parental participation.<BR>



<H3>Vocabulary</H3>

The Teacher’s Guide includes a list of ten vocabulary words for each Learning Objective to use in regular language arts/spelling lessons.<BR>

<H2>Implementing the MDM Curriculum</H2>

<H3>Why are classroom discussions so important in the MDM curriculum?</H3>

In the MDM program, student/teacher interaction is a vital component of every Learning Objective.  By covering the "Discuss!"  questions first, students gain an excellent grasp of the concepts.  This is an important preparation for completing any of the activities or worksheets.

Encouraging students to share personal experiences promotes the free exchange of information, ideas and feelings.  With teacher guidance, students suggest most of the appropriate answers themselves.  As discussion leaders, teachers act as the expert or final authority on the subject only after students have exhausted their own ideas.



<P>

Scientific research demonstrates that children have an innate knowledge of life skills.  The suggested questions draw out that knowledge.  This interrogatory style of teaching is referred to as the Socratic method.  Research and experience show that the Socratic method maximizes student comprehension and participation.  The Socratic method is particularly beneficial for students who rarely take part in classroom discussions.



<H3>What is the importance of small group activities?</H3>

The small group activities develop independence and social skills.  They also provide excellent opportunities for students to practice courtesy, sharing and cooperation.  When organizing groups, MDM recommends dividing classes in different ways to avoid always having the same students together e.g.  alphabetically, by height, by random drawing, by seating, etc.).  A responsible leader is appointed or elected to maintain order in each group.



<P>

Some small group activities may be too challenging for younger students.  In this case, alternate activities are available or the teacher can lead the activity personally.



<H3>What is the importance of role play activities in MDM?</H3>

Role playing is the most effective way to develop interactive skills.  Students must think, feel and act, responding totally to each dramatic situation.  Role play also gives students the opportunity to act out real-life situations and practice refusal skills and problem-solving techniques.



<P>

Here are a few ideas to strengthen role play activities:

<UL>

	<LI>Tell different groups of students to play the same scene.<BR>

	<LI>Repeat a role play after having students exchange roles.<BR>

	<LI>Use props and costumes to add realism or humor.<BR>

	<LI>Use sound, scenery or lighting effects to add drama.<BR>

	<LI>Ask students to perform their best skits for another class.<BR>

	<LI>Videotape sessions to play back for students and other classes.<BR>

	<LI>Ask students in the audience to write down alternative responses.<BR>

	<LI>Praise students for their performance and participation.<BR>

</UL>



<H3>How does the MDM program involve parents?</H3>

Parental involvement is essential for successful life skills development.  For that reason, this program includes a number of teaching tools that increase child/parent interaction.  MDM introduces parents to the program with a special letter they take home following the assembly.  The following two activities further develop parental interest and participation:<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../graphics/parentid.gif" ALT="Parent's OK">

<P><OL>

	<LI>Teachers use the two worksheets accompanying each Learning Objective so students can practice their skills at home.  The worksheets were designed to give parents a time to share structured teaching activities with their children.  All the activities are simple and intuitive so no special training is needed.  Check boxes are provided to verify parental participation.  The worksheets also stimulate family interest and discussions on important topics.<BR>



	<P><LI>MDM encourages inviting parents to be "Visitors" whenever possible.  Student parents are a terrific resource with a variety of diverse careers, skills, talents, hobbies, travel experiences and cultural backgrounds.  Once a few parents participate, others will want to contribute as well.<BR>

</OL>



<H3>How do teachers maintain MDM’s excitement throughout the year?</H3>

The MDM development team came up with a few ideas to help:

<UL>

<STRONG>Be regular!</STRONG> Schedule a daily or weekly "Million Dollar Machine Time" to use these lessons.  Scientific evidence demonstrates that life skills curricula are more effective when presented over an extended period.

<P>

<STRONG>Be flexible!</STRONG>  Explore some of the Learning Objectives on a purely verbal level.  Just a few minutes of discussion or role play will accomplish a great deal.  Teachers can also use the ready made worksheets to save time on written assignments.

<P>

<STRONG>Share!</STRONG>  Get together with other teachers to exchange ideas on activities that were particularly effective.  Teachers can also share suggestions with the MDM development team by filling out a postpaid evaluation form in the back of every Teacher’s Guide.

<P>

<STRONG>Take it easy!</STRONG>  Having students teach each other makes these lessons most effective.  Children are often more likely to adopt positive attitudes and good morals from their peers than they are from teachers and parents.

<P><STRONG>Integrate!</STRONG>  This program benefit students in every area of their lives.  Teachers can easily combine the activities with regular social studies, language arts, science, art and music lessons.

<P><STRONG>Have fun!</STRONG>  Everyone who experiences the Million Dollar Machine introduction remembers the enthusiastic response to the robot's assembly.  The activities and worksheets in the MDM guide recreate that excitement.  Thousands of educators across the country already know that the MDM curriculum is fun and easy to teach.  And that it works.
