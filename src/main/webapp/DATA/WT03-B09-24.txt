NEWS OF THE WORLD

If the penny hadn't dropped before, December's announcement by Capital
Cities/ABC that it was joining the 24-hour news business in 1997
confirmed that televised news is no longer the preserve of the
traditional networks, and that in order to retain market share better
to be a rolling service than one which relies on that now rather
decrepit notion of expecting viewers to tune-in for their news at set
times during the day.

In staking its claim for a piece of the all-news market, Capital
Cities/ABC joins rival American network NBC and Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp, all of which have in their sights the superabundance of existing
24-hour news and business news channels now in service worldwide.

So why the sudden rash of interest in 24-hour news? After all,
programmers have long bemoaned that news is too expensive to produce -
especially the thrifty generalist satellite channels. This, however, is
changing. News costs might not still be in the same league as, say, a
half-hour of syndicated infotainment acquired from a US programme
distributor, but technology developments inside and outside the studio,
coupled with the changing commercial view that news can be a profit-
generator not just a cost-centre, are putting it within the reach of
the many rather then the few.

But while the entry barriers come tumbling down, for cable distribution
they still remain high, meaning carriage is more and more dependent on
strategic cable operator-programmer alliances. For example, the Time
Warner/Turner merger, combining, among others, the top two US MSOs (if
Turner shareholder TCI is included) and CNN, is a timely boost for
America's original all-news channel just as the competition is about to
hot-up. Meanwhile, in the US, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America,
Rupert Murdoch seems to be assembling the pieces which when connected
will light up a global news network. And where cable distribution
cannot be guaranteed by News Corp or even its own budding partnership
with TCI, direct-to-home will be an effective alternative source of
supply.

For the rest of the field, however, even those with financial muscle,
distribution will probably have to be sought outside of cable. Hence
the partnership between NBC and Microsoft to launch the US
broadcaster's proposed round-the-clock news service on the Internet.

While audiences for such a channel might not at first be as widespread
as, say, cable or even DTH, new technologies and changing commercial
strategies, which are rewriting the way television news is packaged for
consumption, suggest the interactive medium is a better one for the
distribution of visual news.

Bob Ross, Turner Broadcasting president, international, speaking in
Hong Kong in December, predicted that news channels of the future would
act more like radio stations than traditional TV newscasters. Instead
of airing live bulletins, news channels would simply select from a
'playlist' of recorded, but constantly-updated items, refreshing the
running order throughout the day.

If news is to be presented as such - especially business news, whose
natural audience is in the workplace - is there a better way of
distributing it than via an interactive medium which allows viewers to
double-click on the news that is relevant to their world?

HAVAS FORCES CLT TO QUIT THE DIGITAL CLUB

COMPAGNIE Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) has reportedly
withdrawn plans to launch Club RTL, its Astra-based French-language
digital direct-to-home bouquet.

In return for dropping plans to launch the package of 15 to 20
channels, which would be in direct competition to Canal Plus, the
Luxembourg-based broadcaster is reputedly set to become a 25 per cent
shareholder in Canalsatellite Numerique and to contribute several
television channels to the Canal Plus DTH bouquet.

The news followed weeks of speculation. Havas, a mutual shareholder in
CLT and pay-TV giant Canal Plus, had from the outset never been
comfortable with the idea of two competing bouquets for France and had
pushed for a union of the two projects. Havas president Pierre Dauzier
said in an interview last month that there could only be one European
bouquet, claiming "no one can beat Canal Plus."

The two companies reached an agreement to share conditional access and
digital IRDs last summer, with CLT joining the SECA alliance led by
Canal Plus and Bertelsmann to develop the Mediaguard system.

CLT had seven transponders reserved on the Astra satellites 1E, 1F and
1G. With this capacity probably about to become vacant, Europe's pay-TV
groups - most notably Canal Plus - may now be expecting an unexpected
increase to their digital Astra allocations.

KIRCH JOINS MMBG ON THE REBOUND

THE digital decoder battle in Germany between the Multimedia-
Betriebsgesellschaft (MMBG) consortium and the Kirch group took a
dramatic turn on December 1 when Deutsche Telekom confirmed it would
not be aligning itself to Kirch's digital decoder technology,
effectively forcing Kirch to join the MMBG.

While MMBG defied the sceptics by displaying its Mediabox decoder in
Cologne in November, the entire MMBG constellation was threatened by
Deutsche Telekom's hesitation on whether to break away from MMBG and
team-up with Kirch and Vebacom, Germany's second largest cable
operator.

Deutsche Telekom announced, however, that it was the MMBG's Mediabox
which offered "a very good platform for the establishment of an open
and non-discriminatory system in Germany." The PTT cable operator
criticised Kirch's failure to comply with its protocol and to provide
the necessary technical specifications - Kirch, it seems, had been
bluffing about the superiority of its d-box technology.

Now Kirch is to take an eight per cent stake in the MMBG and work on a
unified decoder system for the German market - a solution which will
allay fears of two competing decoder systems splitting the German
digital TV market and confusing the consumer.

Germany's Chancellor Kohl, a close political ally of Leo Kirch, stepped
into the digital decoder fray to ask why a French-developed decoder
system (MMBG's SECA-developed Mediabox) was to be chosen by the MMBG in
favour of a German one (Kirch's d-Box). Prompted by Kohl, Deutsche
Telekom, in its public service role, was forced to re-examine the
qualities of MMBG's Mediabox against the Kirch/Nokia-manufactured d-
box. MMBG had given Telekom until mid-December to decide on its role,
leaving the digital decoder consortium in a very precarious position.

As for Kirch, the Munich-based television company never enthused over
the idea of joining the MMBG and partaking in its "open and non-
discriminauory system," despite an offer of a 15 per cent shareholding.
Kirch preferred to fight for its position as the digital gatekeeper in
Germany with its own decoder and Irdeto conditional access system. Now
poised to join MMBG, it seems that Kirch has lost the decoder battle.

Without Telekom, the MMBG would have been in trouble - Deutsche Telekom
currently holds a 35 per cent share in the consortium and its 15
million cable connections were vital for the MMBG to succeed. Vebacom
has a further 1.1 million connections.

MMBG's recent display of its Mediabox decoder countered claims from the
Kirch camp that the consortium did not have a fully-functioning
decoder. The Franco-German consortium said it plans to start operations
in April with further members of the consortium to include oRF, SRG,
Bauer Verlag, RTL-2 and Tele Munchen. Philips is to start mass
production of the decoder this month with key components coming from
its factories in Krefeld and Hamburg. By the start of 1996, the decoder
will be available to French retailers and in Germany by April, with an
estimated qrice-tag of DM1,000-1,510 (#455!to #682).

BELGIUM'S CABLERS THREATEN BLACK-OUT

THE re-negotiation of a global agreement between Belgium's cable
operators and rights-holders on the payment of authors rights reached a
stalemate in December, with cablers threatening to cease carriage of
half of the channels currently distributed if no progress is made
before January 1.

The dispute flared-up back in September when authors' association Sabam
announced that it did not want to renew the global contract on cable
rights, concluded in 1993 between Belgian cable association RTD,
broadcasters and copyright holders (Sabam, Agicoa, Belfitel). Under the
agreement cable companies are allowed to distribute 16 channels from of
a list of 21 able to be received in Belgium via terrestrial
transmitters. Cable operators, meanwhile, pay an amount equivalent to
15 per cent of the average subscription fee (BFr539 (#12)), which is
added to subscribers' bills. Other channels wishing to be carried on
cable, such as pay-TV and satellite channels, have to pay for cable
retransmission rights themselves.

According to Sabam, any new agreement should take into account the
multiplication of channels with the advent of the digital era and
should include a clause regarding neighbouring rights (performers,'
producers' and broadcasters' rights) as provided by Belgian law from
last year. The amount paid to rights-holders should therefore be
increased, the organisation said.

Cable operators argued that, in the last 10 years, the amount paid to
rights-holders has increased by 79 per cent in-line with the increase
in the number of subscribers and of the cable subscription fee. An
increase in authors' royalties would jeopardise their profitability,
they claim, as the Wallonian government forces them to pay a special
tax of BFr150 per subscriber to support local TV stations. They also
consider this a disadvantage in comparison with the DTH industry, as
satellite equipment owners are not subject to the payment of authors'
rights.

According to RTD, the ideal solution would be for broadcasters to pay
for authors' rights themselves. If the current system is maintained,
they would like to see three new channels, M6, Sat 1 and La Cinquiame,
included in the global agreement. And if neighbouring rights have to be
taken into account, RTD claims it could only be practicable if the
amount paid to authors is reduced by an equal amount.

DEUTSCHE WELLE TO LEAD ASIA BOUQUET

A DIGITAL bouquet of between four and five European TV channels, 12
European radio stations and a data channel is to be created for the
Asia-Pacific region via the recently-launched Asiasat 2 satellite. The
package is being spearheaded by German overseas broadcaster Deutsche
Welle, whose 36MHz C-Band Asiasat 2 transponder will be home to the new
multiplex.

The transponder will be compressed using NTL's MPEG-2, DVB-compliant
digital compression system. Deutsche Welle will be using an 8MHz
digital stream and the other television channels between 6MHz and 8MHz.
However, as the new craft will not be ready for digital broadcasters
until April, the package will initially test-transmit in analogue.

Contracts have yet to be finalised and the remaining channels in the
package still to be announced, though it is expected that there will be
representation from other European countries, including Italy's Rai,
TVE of Spain and, if agreement can be reached with Star TV, MCM, the
francophone music channel.

Although some Deutsche Welle programming is already broadcast in the
Asia region via tape-delivered distribution deals with terrestrial
broadcasters such as SBS in Australia, Mongolia Television and a number
of Chinese stations, which then dub programming into their local
languages, the Asiasat service will mark the German pubcaster's first
full channel service in Asia.

Initial distribution will be to cable headends and hotels. Channel
distribution will be handled by Transtel, the distribution arm of
German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF. They in turn have agent
representation throughout the Asia region.

SNG 'RETIREMENT' PLAN FOR ASTRA 1A

SOCIETE Europeenne des Satellites (SES) is planning to use its Astra 1A
craft for satellite newsgathering (SNG) and other related services when
the satellite nears the end of its natural life. The first Astra
satellite, launched in December 1988, would be placed into inclined
orbit and moved to a second orbital slot, probably one of those applied
for by Luxembourg's government on SES's behalf.

Once in position, Astra 1A could be used for both news and sports feeds
and, said the company, backhauls of programming services to the Astra
platform at 19.2 degrees East.

According to SES, if Astra 1A has insufficient reserves of fuel it
could be placed into inclined orbit where, initially at least, it could
provide service for 23 hours-a-day.

Astra 1A has a design life of 12-and-a-half years. Although two
transponders have been shut down to prevent overheating, the remaining
14 remain in sound working order. While establishing a digital platform
at 19 degrees East, SES remains committed to providing a continuous
analogue service for existing customers and viewers.

A move for Astra 1A would be most likely post-1998, when Astra 1H will
assure back-up for the entire Astra fleet.

ASIA looks set to receive its second Hollywood satellite movie channel
as HBO Asia reaches the final stages of its discussions on the
viability of a Cinemax channel launch in the region. A decision is
expected early in 1996.

HBO Asia's outgoing president Bill Hooks said there was room in the
region for a competitively-priced library-based movie channel to
compliment HBO.

The Cinemax channel would be carried as one of the five or six
compressed channels HBO Asia is planning next year for its Apstar-1
satellite transponder. At the moment, the transponder is used to
transmit a separate censor-sensitive version of the HBO movie channel
to Malaysia's Mega-TV.

HBO Asia also revealed that US equipment supplier General Instrument
was the most likely vendor of HBO's digital compression technology.
Other likely channels for the increased capacity are a channel for
India and an uncensored feed for markets which want their HBO in its
original form.

Despite being forced by the lack of infrastructure into basic channel
delivery and in spite of its above-average charges, the pan-Asian
English-language Hollywood blockbuster channel has chalked up
impressive gains in the region. Hopes were that the channel would reach
more than one million cable subscribers by the end of 1995.

At the end of 1994, HBO Asia had 600,000 subscribers. This was done at
the same time as the industry sounded the death knell for pan-Asian
programming. Although HBO has ruled out local movies on HBO Asia, the
programmer has not dismissed the possibility of local films on a second
movie channel.

NETHOLD NORDIC SETS MODEST DIGITAL AIMS

DIGITAL satellite services from Nethold and its subsidiaries FilmNet
and MultiChoice are scheduled to commence via Astra 1E in mid-January.
However, distributor MultiChoice is targeting mid-March as the date
when there will be sufficient receiver numbers in the marketplace to
meet anticipated demand.

MultiChoice Sweden is expecting a gradual build-up in supplies from
manufacturers, including Pace, Nokia, Echostar and Philips. From Day
One, few receivers are expected to be in the marketplace, but this is
expected to build within a matter of weeks. The company expects 100,000
units to be sold across Scandinavia within the first 12 months.

Prices will initially range between SKr6,000 and SKr8,000 (#600-800)
according to the model and whether or not a dish, with or without a
universal LNB, has already been installed.

MultiChoice said that the demand for receivers in South Africa, where
MultiChoice recently launched its PAS-4 DSTV package, was the main
reason why March was being sited as the optimum date for delivery of
regular supplies. However, demand in South Africa equates as much to
stock shortages as it does to the public's appetite for digital
satellite television.

Nethold's three Astra 1E transponders 1E will carry shared services
from FilmNet, SuperSport, Hallmark Entertainment Network and
independent channels for subscribers in Scandinavia and the Benelux.
These are expected to include channels distributed by MultiChoice in
the VideoCrypt II package, among them Discovery, TCC and CMT. In
addition, the subscriber management company will also make available 10
near-video-on-demand channels and an audio service expected to be
provided by Digital Music Express. A majority of the services will be
common to all markets and carry local subtitling and soundtracks.

Travel expects to start in-the-clear transmissions by March and BBC
Prime - currently available via FilmNet's Eurocrypt card - and BBC
World are believed to have been lined-up for Astra distribution.

Separate digital uplinks across Scandinavia will deliver the Nethold
services to Intelsat 601 at 27.5 degrees West. These will be received
in Hilversum, added to other services, then reuplinked to the Astra
system.

THOR 2A FILLIP FOR ONE DEGREE WEST

NORWEGIAN telco Telenor has signed a contract with Hughes Space and
Communications International to build a new, 15-transponder satellite
for the one degree West orbital position. Thor IIA, as the satellite is
to be known, is expected to be operational by spring 1997 and will
distribute both analogue and digital channels to cable networks and
private dishes throughout northern Europe and Scandinavia.

Telenor also plans to increase capacity with a further four to six
transponders in 1996 and is claiming that one degree West will become
the third largest digital satellite platform in Europe after Astra and
Eutelsat.

Telenor launched a package of open digital satellite-distributed TV
channels in Oslo in late November. The digital Nordic bouquet contains
two Danish channels - Danmark's Radio TV1 and TV2 - Norwegian state
broadcaster NRK and Swedish channels TV1 and TV2, which will eventually
be available on cable networks throughout Scandinavia.

Telenor said it hopes to be able to offer the digital channels free
within the next two years, so private households can access the digital
channels without a smart card.

It is the first time that the Danish state channels have been available
on Norwegian television - the Swedish channels have been on Norwegian
cable for some time. Besides the Nordic digital channels, Telenor
distributes 17 analogue channels to cable and DTH via Thor, Intelsat
702 and TV Sat  at one degree West.

Telenor CTV said the aim is to establish an open platform, as there is
great consensus for open conditional access in the Nordic territories.
An open standard, it said, will both maximise digital penetration and
promote the efforts of hardware manufacturers.

SKY VENTURE TO AIR GRANADA ARCHIVES

UK BROADCASTER Granada and British Sky Broadcasting have joined forces
to create a new company, Granada Sky Broadcasting, which plans to
launch eight new satellite channels late this year. The new channels
will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which will offer programming from the
extensive libraries of both Granada and LWT, including episodes of the
long-running soap Coronation Street.

The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle topics: health
and beauty, home and garden, food and wine, Granada Good Life, Granada
Men and Motoring, Granada Talk TV and Granada TV Shopping Guide.

The GSkyB package will be available as part of the Sky Multi-Channels
package, which currently offers 28 channels and programme streams at a
cost of #10.99 per month.

David Chance, deputy managing director of BSkyB, was unable to say
whether this would increase as a result of Granada's channels: "Its way
too premature to say whether we will change our retail pricing
structure at all."

The GSkyB package will probably be spread across three transponders,
possibly on Astra 1D, on which BSkyB still has spare capacity. Granada
Gold Plus will broadcast for 18-hours-a-day, while the lifestyle
channels will take the form of programme packages. Men and Motoring,
for example, will have a late evening slot following on from Granada
Gold Plus.

All seven lifestyle channels will feature predominantly new programming
produced by Granada and LWT. "This venture will open-up a whole new
avenue of custom-programme making," said Charles Allen, chief executive
of Granada Television, "enabling us to significantly expand our
programme production facilities in both London and the North West."

Granada's economic interest in the channel is 60 per cent, although its
ownership is limited to 20 per cent under current regulations. However,
Granada is hoping the government will remove the ownership restrictions
on broadcasters becoming involved in satellite channels, and thus allow
it to increase its stake in the new venture.

TCI AND CANAL PLUS IN THEMATIC UNION

TELE-COMMUNICATIONS International, Canal Plus and Generale D'Images,
the media arm of Generale des Eaux, have joined forces to form a new
cable and satellite programming company based in Paris. Each of the
three parties will hold an equal interest in the venture,
Multithematiques.

Canal Plus and Generale D'Images are contributing their combined
interests in four French thematic channels to Multithematiques -
documentary channel Planate (70 per cent), cult programming service
Canal Jimmy (85 per cent), and mini-pay movie channels Cine Cinemas and
Cine Cinefil (60 per cent each). Canal Plus has also contributed a 50
per cent share in the Spanish classic movie channel Cine Classics.

TCI, meanwhile, has agreed to contribute Fr492 million (#66 million) to
Multithematiques over the next two years to develop the thematic
channels worldwide.

Multithematiques will act as a launch pad from which to expand across
Europe, provide new services for TCI's Latin American cable and DTH
ventures and bring thematic channel concepts to TCI's Japanese cable
subscribers. TCI also anticipates co-operation between Multithematiques
and its UK division Flextech in production and channel development.

TCI president, international, Adam Singer, will serve as the first
chairman of Multithematiques, while Canal Plus executive vice-president
international Michel Thoulouze will be the company's CEO.

EUROSPORT DEFEATED IN DUTCH TEST-CASE

EUROSPORT has lost its case against KTA before the Amsterdam court and
will be dropped from the cable operator's system in the Dutch capital
from January 1. The pan-European sports programmer refused to pay the
carriage fee sought by KTA, countering that it should be the recipient
of a Gld0.20 payment. However, the court ruled that the cable operator
is entitled to seek payment from commercial channels.

An offer from KTA to include the channel in its D2 Mac/Eurocrypt
extended basic tier was rejected by Eurosport. Other channels expected
to suffer the same fate include NBC Super Channel and TNT & Cartoon
Network.

With the franco-American owned Eurosport standing to lose a large
percentage of its distribution in the Netherlands, the channel is
expected to appeal against the decision and is also lodging a complaint
of 'misuse of monopoly' with the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Meanwhile, MTV regained distribution in The Hague after a court ruled
that the local operator, Casema, had broken its agreement with the
Viacom channel when it replaced MTV with local programmer The Music
Factory. However, the judge also ruled that the city of The Hague had
to keep its promise to Music Factory and so now both music channels
will be carried.

It is likely that Music Factory's owner Arcade will now also take KTA
to the courts in order to gain access to the Amsterdam cable system.
During access negotiations, KTA demanded a fee of Gld750 for the
channel, as well as the right to insert local advertising breaks -
conditions which were rejected by Music Factory.

Relations between KTA and MultiChoice have also been showing signs of
strain of late. The Dutch Commissariaat voor de Media upheld
MultiChoice's claim to be able to use its own decoders and subscriber
management system rather than KTA's D2 Mac/Eurocrypt set-top box.

KTA's ailing pay-per-view service Teleselect is available via the same
D2 Mac decoders, and MultiChoice claimed KTA wanted to use its extended
basic services to boost penetration of Teleselect.

MSO TO BUILD NEW STOCKHOLM SYSTEM

KABELVISION, a major owner of Swedish cable systems, said it plans to
invest SKr100 million (#10 million) in a new cable network for the
centre of Stockholm. The new system will be designed to carry not only
pay-TV services and telephony, but also games, home-shopping and
Internet connections.

Kabelvision is initially planning to offer the new services to
inhabitants of!some 1,000 apartmenu dwelliogs where individual dishes
have, until now, been used to serve tenants.

Kabelvision's plans are the result of a recent decision by Stockholm's
authorities to build a high-capacity fibre-optic network for each
apartment block in the Swedish capital. Kabelvision will then connect
and develop its own services.

Construction work on the new network is due to begin this January and
Kabelvision plans to launch its services in either March or April.

Some of Kabelvision's competitors are taking a more cautious stance on
upgrading their systems, however. Singapore Telecom, the new owner of
Stockholm operator Stjarn-TV, which already has one of the country's
most advanced cable systems, recently said that  Sweden is not yet
ready for advanced wired services. According to Stjarn-TV, subscribers
in Sweden will not be willing to pay for the multimedia services that
modern cable technology can offer until the end of the century.

Kabelvision, 37 per cent owned by the Kinnevik division Netcom Systems,
United Communications Inc and Time Warner (both 20 per cent) and
Bonnier (13.5 per cent), has around 500,000 households connected, or 20
per cent of the Swedish market.

OFT BEGINS BSKYB PROBE

The Office of Fair Trading has launched a six-month review of British
Sky Broadcasting's position in the UK's pay-television market. The
review follows months of complaints by cable operators, including
CableTel, Videotron and General Cable, which last year asked Trade and
Industry secretary Ian Lang to refer BSkyB to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The cable operators' chief concern is BSkyB's
practice of bundling channels, claiming that the satellite broadcaster
overcharges them to keep cable rates high and boost Sky's direct-to-
home service.

The OFT's review will be confined to issues relating to the supply in
the UK of programme channels to cable operators. It will also include
the informal undertakings given by BSkyB in March last year.

Once the six-month review is completed, the OFT will decide whether
further action under the competition legislation is appropriate.

In a statement issued in December, BSkyB accused some cable operators
of "using the regulatory process to further their businesses rather
than on building their networks and serving their customers."

SKY NETS MORE SOCCER

In a #125 million deal which left its terrestrial competitors standing,
BSkyB scooped the rights to England's Endsleigh Football League
championship and Football League (Coca Cola) Cup for five years from
the start of the 1996/97 season.

Under the agreement, Sky has exclusive rights to show up to 60 live
matches per season featuring clubs from all three divisions of the
Endsleigh League. Sky will also provide the first ever coverage of all
three end-of-season promotion play-offs from Wembley, and will show at
least one live tie from each round of the League Cup, plus the final.

Most of the live matches will be screened by the satellite pay-TV
broadcaster on Fridays and Sundays. Sky Sports indicated it was still
too soon to say how the coverage would fit into the existing schedule.

Sky already holds exclusive rights to FA Premiership football (60
matches per season) under its #300 million, five-year deal which
expires at the end of the 1996/7 season. It also has long-term
commitments to broadcast live FA Cup ties and replays, and every
England international from Wembley, plus live rights to Scotland's
three premier tournaments.

Sky broadcast 143 live matches in the 1994/5 season.

SUPERSPORT LAUNCHES

SuperSport, Nethold's new sports channel for the Nordic countries,
launched earlier than expected on December 1. Without any show of
publicity, the channel was offered to FilmNet's subscribers as "an
early Christmas present," according to one company representative.

But the new sesvice was not immediately available to all FilmNet
subscribers. December and January are seen by Nethold as an
'introductory period' when the contents of SuperSport will be tried
out.

The channel will also not be immediately available to all Nordic cable
operators. Negotiations with the region's cable companies are not yet
all in place - most cable systems are already crammed and the
introduction of a new channel means that an existing service has to be
dropped, or else moved to a less attractive slot.

FilmNet's DTH subscribers will have to wait until the end of this month
or the beginning of February before the launch of SuperSport proper.

Programme rights already secured for the new service include American
NHL ice hockey, the Italian Football Cup and German Bundesliga soccer.
Among the tennis rights acquired are the Compaq Grand Slam and the
Hopman tournament.

National events of particular interest to Nordic audiences are also
high on the channel's agenda.

US TRIO BACK IBERIA CABLE

Capital Cities/ABC, United International Holdings (UIH), the Latin
American Urbina group and Spanish cable company Multitel have joined
forces to exploit cable television in Spain and Portugal.

The new alliance has acquired the entire shareholdings of Spanish cable
company TPS, set up by the Urbina group, which distributes the Spanish-
language channels Canal Hollywood, Panda Club, Tele 1 and Discovery
Channel to cable operators.

A new company has been set-up by the four partners in the venture, with
Capital Cities/ABC, UIH and Urbina each holding 30 per cent and
Multitel 10 per cent. The group will initially invest Ptas4,000 million
(#21 million) within a period of three years and distribute the package
of four channems for no more than Qtas600.

The offer will initially consist of film channel Canal Hollywood,
children's channel Panda Club (with programming mainly supplied by
DIC), documentary channel Discovery and Spanish/Latin music channel HIT
TV. A fifth channel will be launched in the next five to six months.

The channels will be broadcast  in Spanish and in their original
versions, with subtitles for the Portuguese market.

NEWS RACE HOTS UP

Capital Cities/ABC Inc is to launch its long -planned 24-hour news
network in 1997, according to president Robert Eiger. ABC already
gathers more news than it can use on its ABC network so the costs would
be relatively low and help spread the news division's expenses. ABC's
200 plus affiliated stations are expected to provide more local news
than CNN which has previously had the all-news field largely to itself.

But in addition to the Capital Cities/ABC venture, General Electric-
owned NBC also announced plans for a 24-hour all-news network for early
1996, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is also planning to start an all-
news channel.

A problem for the new channels is expected to be gaining distribution,
with several new channels battling for space in the crowded US cable
market. When the cable companies go fully digital, this problem will be
alleviated, but in the interim, ABC is also looking at other
distribution methods, such as using telco distribution now being
created in the US, and direct broadcast satellites.

EC IN QUOTA COMPROMISE

The battle against  European programme quotas looks set to continue as
a meeting late in November by EU culture ministers to revise the
Television Without Frontiers directive ended with little change to the
original. The contradictions have been kept in the new 'revised'
proposal, while salt has been rubbed into the quota wound with the news
that the quota system will no longer be phased out after 10 years, but
reviewed after five years.

EU culture ministers reached what they called "a political compromise,"
voting to keep the controversial phrasing of clauses Four and Five of
the original directive to maintain quotas "where practicable and by
appropriate means." The proposed change in the Presidency text to "by
appropriate means" was not taken on. This will allow the UK to maintain
its loose interpretation of the phrasing, but will anger the French,
who had hoped to see a tougher stance on quotas and the "where
practicable" phrase written out.

The new five-year review will please the French, but not member states
such as Germany and the UK, who were hoping to see the quota system
scrapped altogether.

A new article has been added to the directive (article Z), whereby a
committee will be set-up acting alongside the EC to monitor the
implementation of the directive.

THE OTHER RUPERT

In a rare interview, diamonds-to-tobacco tycoon Johann Rupert explains
what lured him into pay-TV, and reveals his hopes and fears for the
digital future. Piero Muscaro and Eleonora Zamparutti ask the questions

Although he made his fortune in tobacco and luxury goods, today the
name of Johann Rupert is synonymous with pay-television. Richemont is
the maker of world-wide brand names like Cartier, Dunhill, Rothmans,
Piaget, Baume & Mercier, Montblanc, Karl Lagerfeld, Chloe and a few
others. With a total turnover of #3.8 billion in 1995 and net profits
of #690 million, Richemont is also one of the largest groups in the
world's pay-television industry through Nethold Corporation, a 50-50
joint venture with the South African public company MIH (MultiChoice
Investment Holding).

Nethold operates in 13 countries in the European pay-television sector,
where it has a total of 2.5 million subscribers. It is present in
northern and eastern Europe as well as in the Benelux with the
MultiChoice-FilmNet group and in the Middle East and Africa with the
South African pay service M-Net.

In 1995, the company booked 24 transponders on the Astra, Eutelsat and
PanAmSat satellites. It has also recently entered the Italian
television market through the acquisition of 32.5 per cent  of Telepiu,
the country's sole pay-TV operator, and 5.5 per cent of Mediaset, the
media holding of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group comprised, among
other interests, Canale 5, Italia 1 and Rete 4, 25 per cent of Spain's
Tele Cinco and 24.5 per cent of the sports channel DSF in Germany.

From the calm shores of Lake Zug, a few miles from Zurich, Switzerland,
Rupert, the managing director and owner of the Richemont Group, plots
the map of the world's pay-television industry.

Cable and Satellite Europe: What were the reasons behind your decision
to diversify Richemont from its tobacco and luxury goods activities
into the pay-television sector?

Johann Rupert: Towards the end of the eighties we set in train a
profound restructuring plan of the group. It was clear since the very
beginning that our core activities, the tobacco and the luxury goods
business, had one point in common: a great cashflow. This is the reason
why we started seeking an alternative diversification for our
investments. At that time, our now partners of M-Net, who operated in
South Africa in the pay-TV business, offered us a chance to enter this
business. After a deep analysis we realised a few things: firstly, pay-
television companies are generally cashflow negative at the end of the
first two years of activities; secondly, in order to reach breakeven
point they need at least five or six years, though over this time they
create added value and also an interesting distribution network.

Beyond the necessities of diversification there are evident synergies
to be made between the pay-television business, the luxury goods and
the tobacco industry: in all three cases Richemont operates in the
field of intellectual properties and, in particular, trademarks.

C&SEu: Apart from the obvious economic and financial synergy between
the three main sectors in which you operate, is there any other reason
that pushed you to enter the television business?

JR: In order to make a good business you have to project yourself 20
years ahead of your time, and try to imagine what people will want by
that time. Then you have to try to retrace that path backward. And when
I look at today's consumer trends and the behaviour of the younger
generations, I am convinced that the future will be based on
information and that consumption will be tightly linked to
entertainment in its widest sense. All economic choices, strategies and
analyses are subject to today's ever faster pace of our daily living
and must be constantly revised and adjusted. We cannot afford any
longer to stand still on a leading market position, because today,
everything can change suddenly.

C&SEu: What criteria did you use to invest in the pay-TV business?

JR: It is very important to be the first entrants in a new market,
especially when the sector is economically virgin. In reality, you do
not buy market shares, you buy market opportunities. Geographical
diversification is an objective linked to the single opportunities
generated by the different markets. That is what happened in the
Netherlands when Esselte decided to sell FilmNet. Recently, in Italy,
we bought 5.5 per cent of Mediaset, Berlusconi's commercial television
network, and a 32.5 per cent share of Telepiu. Mediaset has since
reduced its overall debts and it now has a considerable cashflow.
Telepiu represents a starting point for digital television: in Italy
there is no cable television and satellite television is not thoroughly
developed - there's around 500,000 satellite dishes. Nethold, through
its conditional access developed by the subsidiary Irdeto, together
with the Kirch group, has created an open door on this new market.

C&SEu: What is your relationship with Berlusconi? Some say you actually
entered Mediaset to do Berlusconi a favour in exchange for a sort of
'insurance' in order to guarantee a return on your investment in case
things went wrong....

JR: This is pure science-fiction. Nobody did any favour to Berlusconi.
In fact, we entered Mediaset once Berlusconi was already into politics.
Besides, I only know Berlusconi as a businessman, since I must have met
him four times altogether. Make it clear: Richemont is a public company
that obeys the London Stock Exchange rules and all our activities are
transparent.  According to my opinion, the Number One rule in business
is that any partnership and business decision I take should make the
cover of the world's press.

C&SEu: Nethold operates in many European countries. Do you think that
in the future it will be possible to offer a sole pay-elevision package
common to all the different territories?

JR: I believe we could define Richemont as a multi-domestic company
rather than a multi-national company. You can think globally, though
you have to operate in different countries taking into proper account
the national specifics. In Europe, we need to have companies with good
local market knowledge and also alliances with different countries we
operate in. In the pay-television business, for instance, we can
operate at European level as far as the technologies are concerned, or
in the so called subscriber management system, and in programme
acquisition.

C&SEu: With digital technology in Europe and in the rest of the world,
there has been a proliferation of partnerships between the big
multimedia groups in order to acquire key positions in tomorrow's
television market....

JR: Now that we have developed our technology of conditional access in
digital television, we are finding a great deal of possibilities in
many countries. Different media groups have approached us, thanks to
the decoder, in order to create partnerships aimed at the further
development of the new technologies. Not only in Europe and the Middle
East, but also in Thailand and in Australia, where Murdoch's digital
television project will use our technology.

C&SEu: Talking of the Middle East: what brought you to the partnership
between MultiChoice and ART, the media group owned by Saudi Sheikh
Saleh Kamel, for the distribution of the Arab-language television
package?

JR: In the case of the Middle East it has been a long-term investment
plan. Countries like Egypt, for instance, are key markets. The
partnership between MultiChoice and ART follows the mainstream of the
multi-domestic company we mentioned earlier. Also in this case our
companies brought in their technological know-how and the SMS, while
ART, which has a great experience in broadcasting, will take care of
the programme package. We expect to see the first results in five years
time. For  Nethold it is a matter of being ahead of the competition in
a critical expansion area at relatively low cost, since we can optimise
our economies of scale. After all, as pioneers in this particular
market we will be able to extend our operations in marginal, yet
interesting sectors of the industry, such as education, a key problem
in some remote regions of the Earth.

C&SEu: Digital television - in Europe and in Africa you have been the
first to introduce DSTV (Digital Satellite Television). How will
television users change in their consumption habits?

JR: In the US DirecTv offers to its subscribers 150 digital channels
via satellite. What is interesting to observe is that with such a
variety of choice it is clear that consumers will approach the media
differently. For instance, the navigation system is based on menus
classifying the content in specific categories: cinema, sport, art,
music, and so on. Then, through the use of the remote control one can
select an item, sport for instance, and other sub-menus will appear
allowing more detailed choices, a game of golf or whatever. There would
then be five or more tournaments to choose from.

Such changes in the architecture of choice will make irrelevant what
particular network one is watching. Tomorrow we will not be able to
tell whether we are watching NBC or CBS, or at least this could be one
of the possible outcomes.

C&SEu: A true war on digital television standards is being fought in
Europe and in the rest of the world: on the one hand, Nethold and Kirch
with the Irdeto decoder, and on the other Bertelsmann-Canal Plus-CLT,
and also Murdoch's News Datacom....

JR: One of the few things I am certain of in life is that in economics
as well as in politics or in any other sector, if you want to get
everything, you will end up losing everything. This rule may also be
applied in the digital technology sector. I am certain Nethold will be
able to further develop its present market position in Europe as in the
rest of the world, but it will never be able to be the sole service
provider.

C&SEu: Canal Plus and BSkyB both have strong national identities and
company policies. BSkyB is addressed to the UK where it has 4.2 million
subscribers, whereas Canal Plus has also extended its interests outside
France, though its core activity lies within the French boundaries with
its four million subscribers. Nethold, instead, operates in different
countries none of which represents its main market....

JR: The geographical diversification of our activities can be both a
strength and a weakness. Being focused on one particular local market,
as in the case of Canal Plus and BSkyB, allows you to have an enormous
cashflow. Concentrating all efforts on one market can also mean
employing heavy structures and hence having a less flexible
organisation, which in the medium-term could be a disadvantage for the
company itself. As Nethold we grew in the opposite direction, in the
sense that we had to develop a multi-domestic managerial know-how and
at the same time we had to learn how to deal with different currencies,
in different countries with different programmes in different
languages. We had to create a new distribution network which now finds
its strengths in the conditional access which we first developed in
Europe.

C&SEu: Digital television will bring profound changes, above all from
the industrial-economic viewpoint...

JR: When looking at the present structure of the world industrial
economy, one simple yet efficient consideration comes to my mind: if
you don't eat your breakfast, someone else will eat it. This means that
you must re-engineer your own business before somebody else does it.
And this can only be done through continuous innovation which is
destroying your own business by building a new business.

C&SEu: Which will then be the technological trend in the television
industry?

JR: Here the question is, will present TV operators be able to convert
analogue TV into digital TV without jeopardising their present
subscription status? One of the key elements of the conversion is the
software, which is the television programmes, the movies and all the
products offered to the viewers. Consumers' attitude towards technology
can be more or less active, what is important here is what is offered
with the technology. That is the reason why I am convinced that in
Europe there will be big winners and big losers. All markets will
experience a shake-up of some sort, this includes us as well as Canal
Plus and BSkyB. The real question is whether pay-TV operators will be
able to convert their subscribers from analogue to digital before
someone else does it. I fear that in Great Britain, for instance, there
will be great battles in order to get the Premier League rights. It
would be very strange if big media groups such as Pearson, Carlton TV,
the BBC and British Telecom itself, allowed Murdoch to dominate the
technological revolution for the British market. This would be a choice
of non-innovation. I am not saying that Britain will experience a
technological standards fight, though I reckon there will be common
partnerships, perhaps with Murdoch himself for the joint control of the
digital television industry.

C&SEu: As far as the software is concerned, one of the key questions is
the management of television programme archives....

JR: This is an issue that involves all major public TV operators in
Europe mainly due to their longer histories when compared with  the
commercial operators. For example, does the BBC - which has one of the
most extraordinary television, film and documentary archives in the
world - own the rights for digital television exploitation? I don't
think so, and I think nobody owns them today. 20 years ago, nobody even
dreamt of digital television. Hence all rights were acquired for
terrestrial broadcasting, or even cable or satellite. Certainly not for
digital.

C&SEu: What will then be the role of European public television in the
digital era?

JR: There will be synergies between pay-TV and public broadcasters,
particularly if we manage to clear the TV property rights matter
earlier mentioned. In sport events, for instance, there will most
certainly be co-operation between public broadcasters and pay-
television. In England, it will never be possible to broadcast the
Wimbledon tennis tournament in encrypted form, or just imagine what
could have happened in Italy if we had encrypted with Telepiu the '96
World Cup final, Italy versus Brazil - the government would have
probably been dismissed. Nethold has a very strong traditional
relationship with public broadcasters in Holland, Egypt and Greece.

C&SEu: What will then become the position of the big US operators in
Europe?

JR: I think operators will opt for the development of thematic channels
to be inserted into programme packages offered to viewers, and at the
same time participate with stakes in the SMS. It is necessary to offer
great premium programme packages. Take any Hollywood studio as an
example, none of them is capable of filling five movie channels with
their own productions.

C&SEu: The relationship between pay TV distributors and TV software
producers remains a key issue world-wide. It seems that you are
envisaging a clear separation between SMS and TV channels...

JR: The separation between SMS and television channels is a management
choice which we have already applied to the markets we operate in. Take
M-Net, for instance, which manages the programme offer in South Africa.
When a TV network wants to be distributed in the pan-African satellite
package, it can buy shares of MultiChoice at the same conditions as M-
Net and participate accordingly to the management of the company. In
this way, we can guarantee equal treatment to all shareholders.
Specifically to MultiChoice, it only directly owns four channels out of
the 20 presently distributed.

C&SEu: Could Nethold have a real interest in producing films, as Canal
Plus has with Le Studio Canal Plus?

JR: Software control is certainly one of the key issues in the
transition from analogue to digital. The point is that a single movie
channel airs at least 400 films a year, which means that even if we
bought a

Hollywood major we could cover 10-15 per cent at the maximum of our
product needs and at the same time the same Hollywood major would have
reduced benefits being part of the same company. I am sure that the so
called chain distribution system will collapse in the next 20 years.
Today, a film follows this kind of distribution pattern: first the
theatrical release, then the pay-per-view rights sale, then home video
distribution, pay-television rights, and last, the generic channels.
Now, let's say that in 20 years time in Europe there will be 20 million
households with pay-per-view access. This could guarantee an extremely
important film purchase potential, then perhaps the pay-per-view
providers will produce films for their own distribution networks.

C&SEu: In fact, such integration makes front page news in the US on
almost a daily basis...

JR: Yes, but have you ever heard of any of these multimedia companies
paying cash? I don't think so. It is only a matter of paper exchanges,
just contracts, never real money. Sometimes I doubt that any of these
mergers and acquisitions would have really taken place if real money
was involved. Do you know what $20 billion looks like on a table? Such
financial transactions can only work with share swaps, which is also
the best way to reduce risks.

C&SEu: As in the case of the latest merger between Turner and Time
Warner...

JR: There is always a good reason behind any operation. A very
important and very rich American businessman once told me: 'Johann, how
would you define a successful acquisition? It has to do with a company
easy to buy, hard to sell, and impossible to manage!'

C&SEu: What about Germany which represents the most developed
television market in Europe? Are things going to be even harder?

JR: Germany will perhaps be one of the most important tests of the
conversion path from analogue to digital television as far as Europe is
concerned. In fact, this is the only country where two conditional
access system exist, that is, the d-Box developed by Nethold and Leo
Kirch, and the SECA consortium of Bertelsmann, Canal Plus and CLT.
Today, Germany represents the biggest cable and satellite market in
Europe with over 30 million homes connected, though it is a congested
market. If you wanted to launch a new TV channel in Germany, you
firstly have to buy a transponder on the Astra satellites, which is not
easy since they have all been booked out several years in advance.
Secondly, you will need to sign a distribution agreement with a German
cable operator, an even more complex matter since all cable operators
in Germany have already reached maximum capacity. Now it is obvious
that with the new digital technology, these problems can be solved
since the new system through digital compression will be able to carry
from four to eight channels in digital, per transponder.

As far as we are concerned, Irdeto and Kirch have developed the only
and best set-top box available in the market. We are already producing
it industrially, and will be ready soon - in a matter of days - to
distribute our set-top box to the public. It should be  sufficient to
know that Nethold ordered 1.1 million set-top boxes and Leo Kirch
ordered another million.

C&SEu: Recently in France, TF1 and France Television announced an
agreement for the development of digital television. Several observers
consider the SECA consortium as the key issue for the further
development of digital technology in this country. Do you think the
Bertelsmann-Canal Plus-CLT alliance could come to an end?

JR: Ca depend!  I don't really know, though what I can say is that
there will be new entrants in the market and there will be more
partnerships with new companies. As far as the SECA consortium is
concerned, I don't think CLT, whatever situation they are experiencing,
would break the Bertelsmann-Canal Plus agreement.  These are serious
companies and do normally respect all agreements. We are aware of CLT's
difficult position within the consortium. If Havas will come back on
its decision - a remote possibility - CLT would be an extremely
interesting company but perhaps too big for anybody to take into
consideration, even Murdoch.

C&SEu: What are your relations with Mr Murdoch?

JR: Let's say I have great respect for Mr Murdoch. We have never been
in his way!

C&SEu: In conclusion, how will the digital war end?

JR: Has it ever occurred to you while watching a football match on
television that a friend asked you, who is going to win? I normally
answer: 'Well, that is exactly why we are watching the match!' We
cannot be 100 per cent sure of who is going to win or lose. Even in
digital television, with new standards, new conditional access systems.
I frankly do not know who is going to win, the same way as I am sure
that everybody in the business does not have a clue. Everyone bets on
their own horse. We are certain to own an outsider, the best. Though,
there is always a risk that tomorrow Pierre Lescure, Rupert Murdoch and
I will wake-up and read in the press that a big telecommunications
company has invented a new digital standard, hence upsetting all the
plans of companies like us that today are struggling in this dogfight.

C&SEu: What would you do first thing that morning?

JR: I think I would light-up a good cigarette!

CABLE AND SATELLITE EUROPE via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

IN LIVING COLOUR

Two years on, BETI, the first international outpost of US cable
phenomenon Black Entertainment Television, is ready to fly as a fully-
fledged cable service with an appeal which should be sweet music to UK
MSOs. Bill Hicks reports

Lawrence Nugent, co-founder and managing director, operations for the
UK's first black cable television channel, Black Entertainment
Television International (BETI), pens a neat graphic to demonstrate the
position his channel has reached after two years in the market: it's a
large boulder, which has been pushed nine tenths of the way up the
slope of a very steep mountain. "One more little push, we're there. You
won't be able to stop us."

The 'little push' for the service which began in London two years ago
as Identity Television, but which took the name of its US backer, part-
owner and chief programme supplier BET earlier this year, comes early
in 1996 when the channel boards the Orion 1 satellite, making its
signal available to cable operators across the UK and (in theory) the
rest of Europe as part of Orion's growing bundle of digitally-
compressed cable channels.

The roll-out won't come a moment too soon for would-be viewers outside
London who currently go to the lengths of getting their metropolitan
friends to record the hugely popular shows and mail them the cassettes
- adding new meaning to the phrase 'tape-delivered cable channel.'

Ironically, though - having just taken on the BETI name - the channel
is also about to market itself as 'Television In Colour' with the clear
aim of building on its strong, and always deliberate, crossover appeal
to audiences of all races.

The service now available in 262,000 UK cable homes - all in the London
area - launched in mid-1993 as Identity TV. The channel was created by
three black media professionals, Lawrence Nugent, Petra Bernard (ex-BBC
and Warners, now BETI's managing director, corporate affairs) and
Philip Ismay, all of whom had been thinking along the lines of a TV
channel made by, and for, British Afro-Caribbeans.

"We knew there was a huge gap in the market for black-oriented
programmes," comments Bernard, "and cable appeared to be the ideal
medium for us. It was young, its intentions mirrored our intentions."
Cable in the UK was, and remains, chiefly an urban medium, and most of
the UK's two million-plus Afro-Caribbeans live in the main urban
centres, though from the start the aim was wider.

The idea was to launch a channel which would primarily serve Britain's
black communities, but which would be marketed as an "urban
contemporary" service having strong crossover appeal  beyond the Afro-
Caribbean core audience. In that sense it would not be an 'ethnic'
channel in the way of some of the Asian and other minority-language
services, but a specialist channel: "Yes, we're a niche channel, and
our niche is entertainment," says Bernard.

Identity short-circuited the process of finding backers by going
straight to the original and most successful black channel of all,
Black Entertainment Television of Washington DC. With over 42 million
US subscribers, revenues of $115 million (#76 million), net income of
around $20 million in 1994/5 and a hard-won reputation for excellence
in everything it touches, BET occupies a unique position both in the
cable industry, and as an exemplary African-American business success
story.

"We contacted BET, we got access to the president, Bob Johnson, on
conference lines, and we transacted the whole thing over the
telephone... it was, well you can imagine...," says Bernard.

The chance to participate in a European-based cable channel came at a
good moment for BET, which since its launch in January 1980, had built
up its subscriber base to well over 30 million homes across the US and
(from 1992) Canada. On the way, BET had made history by becoming the
first black-owned company to launch itself on the New York Stock
Exchange (in November 1991); it had become a major, award-winning
programme producer and had already diversified into magazine publishing
(with YSB, Young Sisters and Brothers and Emerge), media sales and
merchandising through BET Direct. It had just picked up a 'Hot Growth'
accolade in Business Week's 100 best Small Corporations awards, and was
more than ripe for international expansion.

With BET behind it, Identity was able to approach the UK cable industry
with renewed confidence. "First we went to the cable operators, and we
were fortunate in that the London Interconnect had just become fully
fledged," Bernard says. "We forged an agreement with the Interconnect
MSOs - though we still needed individual agreements with each operator
- and secured London distribution at a stroke, all except Cable London
and Nynex. We got onto Cable London two months later - and with Nynex,
well we're still in talks."

Identity launched itself in style, rapidly building a loyal following
with a mix of programming from BET, supplemented by series from
Caribbean broadcasters and (increasingly) from its own facilities near
Ladbroke Grove (an area of West London fast becoming an alternative to
Soho's media ghetto) and UK-based independent black producers.

The six-hour schedule - rotated twice to form an 18-hour block from
12.00-06.00 - majored then and now on music, which accounts, according
to Bernard, for 42 per cent of programming: "It won't go any higher
than that," she adds - but nor is likely to get much less, since music
is right at the heart of the BET experience, both in the US and
internationally.

According to BETI affiliate sales and marketing manager Alex Jackman,
the music shows - Video Soul, Rap City, Video Vibrations, Video Mania
(the UK scene, produced in-house), Caribbean Rhythms - are becoming
required viewing for UK aficionados: "Video Soul and Video Vibes in
particular are bang up to date, up to the second on the USA scene, you
won't find anything more current. We're actually breaking black artists
in the UK, introducing names not heard here before," says Jackman.

The other major ingredients of Identity's mix were sports, cultural and
educational programmes, comedy and magazine/discussion shows, all of
which are still represented, though since June 1995, there has, in
Bernard's words, been "a clean sweep of the schedule."

That was the point at which the channel re-launched itself as BETI, and
although there was no change in the US partners' shareholding ("We
remain effectively 50:50 BET and Identity," says Lawrence Nugent),
BET's production styles became the measure for the rest of the output.
"We carried three hours a day from BET from the start, so our viewers
were already familiar with the look," she says. "Our job then was to
make everything else come into sync."

Change always has its price, and BETI has had to placate many loyal
Identity viewers who didn't like the fact that a few of their favourite
series disappeared because they didn't make the quality threshold. This
particularly affected some of the Caribbean-produced shows: "The
quantity was there, but the quality was sometimes tenuous," Bernard
says. "We now insist our suppliers maintain a Beta standard." Several
non-BET series have survived, including the popular, newsy regional
magazine show Caribscope, and the Nigerian soap Checkmate, set in the
Lagos business world.

Unlike its US partner, BETI does not have its own news bulletins,
though it provides regular coverage of "core community events, such as
sports, and the Notting Hill Carnival" in the occasional UK Profile
series.

Since the name change, the religious output has also increased,
reflecting the strong Christian philosophy of the US channel, and its
close links with some of the best known evangelical broadcasters in the
US, including Morris Cerullo. On Sunday mornings, for example, the six
hours of 'downtime' are devoted to the Christian ministries: "This is a
very, very strong element in our service," Bernard says, "and the
audience is very receptive. Someone like Morris Cerullo, one of the
biggest names, his audience is our audience."

On other days this six-hour slot is given over to a "special audio
service" - currently a relay of the London black music station, Choice
FM, though as Nugent remarks, "In the long term we would be looking to
create our own audio service." Ultimately, Nugent  adds,  he intends to
develop multimedia services: "There are ways of going interactive which
do not depend on the cable operators upgrading," he says, "though it
will depend on our having a live studio environment." Expansion of the
BETI production facilities,  probably involving a move from its smart
but limited offices in a converted warehouse, is high on the list of
priorities.

Bernard is also looking forward to adding services: "I'd definitely
like more channels, maybe one with a European slant, and I'd like the
channel to get more heavily involved in its own production," she says.
"We already get more approaches than we can handle in the production
area, people are coming to us with million-dollar ideas."

In Washington, BET is planning to launch its long-awaited BET On Jazz:
The Cable Jazz Channel in America this month, but although the service
will go to Africa (see accompanying story) there are no hard plans as
yet to bring it to the UK. The big priority for the London team is to
build its UK audience, with Bernard admitting that "I had hoped the
national picture would come sooner, but it is happening for us now."

As Nugent points out, however, it has taken the full two years to get
the message across to MSOs: "The biggest problem we had in the old days
was that we were deemed to be black entertainment for black
subscribers, so we had to go through the phase of changing their
perceptions. Of course they wanted a channel for their black customers,
but we weren't too comfortable with the idea that we were just for
them, it could alienate other viewers and subscribers."

"When we were IDTV, many operators were confused about us," confirms
Jackman. "They knew about BET in the US, but were confused about the
level of their involvement. They still liked us - they used to say,
'well we prefer you to the foreign channels'!"

Hence the name-change, hence the need for re-educating the industry and
the public, hence the 'Television In Colour' marketing push that broke
in December with billboard, radio and press advertising highlighting
BETI's strengths in sports, music and religious programming. "In the
US, they've achieved high penetration by being good programme-
providers, and we're hoping to emulate that."

The modest target is to "reach 900,000 homes by the end of 1996, and to
get over the million mark very soon after." The stated aim is to reach
4.5 million UK homes by the end of the decade, but to do so by
remaining cable-exclusive. The decision to take digital capacity on
Orion, Jackman stresses, is not a step on the road to going DTH: "All
along we have had a policy of linking ourselves to the success of
cable, and to growing as cable grows. They need us, they need cable-
exclusive original programming, and that's what we are."

BETI UK's total loyalty to cable is not shared by its US godparent: in
September this year, BET joined DirecTv's 'Total Choice' DBS package,
its first move into direct-to-home distribution. And now it is about to
use digital DTH to take its jazz service to southern Africa.

So had BETI never been tempted by BSkyB's Multi-Channels DTH bandwagon,
which would effectively get it into another three million homes at a
stroke? Obviously the potential had been weighed up, but to date the
advantages of staying cable-exclusive, basic tier had outweighed the
lure of the VideoCrypt club. On the other hand, as Bernard notes, "If
the question ever arises, we'd give it due consideration."

National coverage will also raise BETI's attractiveness to advertisers.
It has already attracted an impressive roster on the basis of its
London distribution, encompassing major brands - BT, Mercury, Levis,
Volkswagen, EMI, Cellnet - as well as a host of advertisers from the
black business sector, ranging from travel services, record labels,
hair and beauty products, food and drink specialist suppliers.
Sponsorship is also becoming a useful add-on revenue source, with Carib
Beer, for example, putting its name to BETI's in-house music show for
clubbers, C-lector; and Jamaican building society, Victoria Mutual
Finance, sponsoring the latest six-parter, Sarge In Charge.

At some point, BETI is expected to embark on its European roll-out,
made possible by the Orion feed. "Yes, Europe's in the master plan,"
Bernard says. "At the recent ECC show, we had lots of enquires from
European operators - interest is very strong, even in eastern Europe."

Capacity on cable systems is an even greater problem in parts of Europe
than in the UK, but it's one which Bernard believes is not insuperable
in either case: "They had no problem in the UK satisfying Disney, so
obviously there are ways around the problem."

BET TAKES JAZZ TO AFRICA

BET's 24-hour jazz channel, BET On Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel, is to
join MultiChoice's South African DTH package, DSTV, on April 1, just
three months after the channel launches on cable networks in the US.

The service, first mooted in 1993 and understood to be costing $20-30
million (#13-20 million) to launch, will be the world's first channel
dedicated to jazz, will be offered alongside DSTV's existing 18
channels at no extra cost, and will be marketed in South Africa,
Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique and Botswana. Both
the channel and the MultiChoice deal are breakthroughs for BET, which,
with 43.4 million cable subscribers in North America (at November
1995), and with its domestic business already well diversified into
related media and marketing activities, is now firmly looking to
international markets for expansion. "This is a very big move for us,"
BET International vice president George Amoah comments. "Although we've
been supplying programming to African broadcasters for the last year-
and-a-half on a syndicated basis, this is the first time we've launched
there in such a big way."

BETI supplied Bop-TV with an eight-hour daily block of (chiefly
educational) programming which was distributed across African and the
Middle East from a C-Band Intelsat transponder, and now supplies
similar programming to SABC's NNTV, as well as to affiliates in Kenya
and Nigeria the Caribbean, and even to Poland.

"Our plans call for global expansion," he adds, "and we're going into
it aggressively... our initial focus is Europe and southern Africa."

As in the US, where BET has developed a range of complementary
businesses, BETI intends to develop similar opportunities for programme-
related merchandise in South Africa, by building up relationships with
local business.

While Amoah indicated that BETI was eager to bring the jazz channel to
the UK and the rest of Europe, how it will do so - whether as a
complement to the London-based BETI cable-exclusive service using
additional digital capacity on Orion, or as a member of one or more of
the evolving national digital DTH packages - was not yet decided.

What is clear is that the promised mix of live concerts, classic
performances, jazz movies and documentaries will find big ready-made
audiences across Europe and Scandinavia, whichever option is chosen.

TRANS-SIBERIAN AWAKENING

Eutelsat's energetic courting of the Russians is beginning to pay
dividends, with Hot Bird thawing a long-frozen DTH industry, and plans
for the new SESAT satellites well advanced. Chris Dziadul reports from
Moscow

Eutelsat has played a key role in integrating the Russian Federation
into the global satellite industry, both by granting it full membership
status and greatly improving coverage of the country by its satellites.

The process arguably began in 1990 when the organisation decided to
modify two of its Eutelsat II series satellites in order to extend
their coverage to the Urals and Caucasus. Although one was subsequently
lost following the failure of Ariane V63 in early 1994, coverage had by
that time been extended to mid-Siberia and three former Soviet Central
Asian republics by relocating Eutelsat l F1 to 48 degrees East.
Membership followed later in the year in a process that took only three
months instead of the usual eight, thereby indicating how much value
Eutelsat placed on the Russian Federation's future input into the
organisation.

The results to date have undoubtedly been fruitful for both sides. In
Eutelsat's case, it has been able to draw on the country's vast
experience in the satellite industry to order a whole generation of new
telecommunications satellites, while for the Russian Federation
benefits of contacts with - and finally membership of - Eutelsat have
included use of the Satellite Multiservices System (SMS) for Vsat
networks and - since the middle of 1995 - being linked up to the
organisation's international trunk telephony network via an earth
station in Moscow.

Furthermore, in the field of satellite television broadcasting - which
currently accounts for 75 per cent of Eutelsat's income - the launch of
Hot Bird 1 has made viewing of European channels possible in Moscow
with 90cm dishes (rising to 1.2-metres nearer the Urals). At the same
time, Russian broadcasters have been given the opportunity to transmit
their programming using Eutelsat's network far beyond the country's
borders.

Although this has so far only been taken up by the independent
commercial station NTV (which is almost available nationally in the
Russian Federation and claims a 40 per cent audience share in Moscow),
Philippe Cayla, Eutelsat's head of service, new projects, says the
organisation would also like to see the national public broadcasters
ORT and RTR eventually become its clients.

While the Hot Bird system (which currently comprises Eutelsat ll F1 and
Hot Bird 1) will by 1997 be expanded by three further satellites (Hot
Birds 2, 3 and 4) to give even better coverage of the Russian
Federation, Cayla says the 18-transponder SESAT (Siberia-Europe
SATellite) satellite will be designed specially for the country. Due to
be launched in 1998, it will be built by the company NPO-PM in
Krasnoiarsk, located at the 48 degrees East orbital position and cover
an area from western Europe to central Siberia.

In Cayla's view, the "best option" would be for half of SESAT's
transponders to be taken up by Russian clients and for them to offer
viewers "a bouquet of five to six channels." He also feels the
satellite, which will in addition to its standard coverage have a spot
beam aimed at China and southern Asia, may be followed by a second
(SESAT II) craft targeting the far east of Russia.

Eutelsat's efforts have also made a great impact on Russia's domestic
DTH industry, as Alexander Atrashkevich, commercial director of Teleset
attests. Moscow-based Teleset is one of the oldest privately-owned
cable and DTH equipment companies in the Russian Federation, having
been set-up soon after the former Soviet Union gave the green light to
free enterprise in 1988.

From the outset, its business has been divided into three parts: the
manufacture of satellite antennas, which initially were nearly all
exported to European countries due to poor local demand; the import of
electrical components for cable and satellite systems; and the
installation of complete cable and satellite systems throughout the
Russian Federation.

According to Atrashkevich, the country's DTH market only began to
experience "serious growth" in 1995 when Eutelsat's Hot Bird enabled
viewers in Moscow to receive a wide range of European channels with a
90cm dish. Indeed, whereas only a year earlier they had to pay between
$700 to $800 (#460-530) for a 2.5-metre system to receive Eutelsat ll
F1, signals from the new satellite could now be picked up in the
capital with equipment retailing for around $230 - roughly the cost of
a 14-inch colour TV set.

Signals from the Scandinavian platform at one degree West also only
require small sized dishes, and while legal cards are unavailable in
the country pirated versions can be bought for as little as $50.

Although Atrashkevich says it is impossible to give a figure for the
number of dishes in the Russian Federation, information he receives
"from partners and competitors" leads him to believe the total number
of systems sold each year could be between 50-80,000. What is clear,
however, is that the market is growing to the extent that sales in 1995
represented a three-fold increase on those of the previous year, and
this could to rise to six-fold in 1996 due to such factors as reception
of more satellites being possible with small dishes and the launch of
new Russian-language channels which will be distributed by satellite.

He adds that one of the peculiarities of the Russian market is that
although "99.9 per cent of people in big cities live in [apartment]
blocks," smatv systems are relatively rare. Indeed, such are the
discrepancies in people's incomes, many are prepared - and can indeed
afford to - buy their own systems. This may be especially  true in
Moscow, where it is believed average monthly salaries are between $600
and $700 as opposed to the national figure of around $140.

Teleset was an official distributor for Pace between 1991 and 1993, but
now supplies several brands of DTH equipment. In Atrashkevich's view,
there is no clear leader in a market which - in Moscow's case - is
served by only around a dozen retail outlets and several principal
distributors from which the public often buys directly.

Teleset is also builds small private cable networks for offices and
banks. Geographically, its involvement stretches beyond the Federation
to Belarus and Ukraine, although in the latter's case this is limited
due to the poor economic situation.

Atrashkevich believes that although both cable and DTH markets will
continue to grow in the Russian Federation, competition will intensify
and - in the case of cable - the five-year breakeven point for new
systems may deter some investors.

His views are to some extent shared by Alexander Drozdetski, the
commercial director of St Petersburg-based A & A Ltd - the official
distributor for Pace in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekhistan - and the General Satellite Association. While
acknowledging growth in the DTH market, he feels this has been most
noticeable in Moscow and central parts of the Russian Federation where
Hot Bird has had the greatest impact, whereas in St Petersburg
reception of most satellite signals (including Astra, Eutelsat and all
those serving Scandinavia) has always been easier with small dishes:
TV3, for instance, can easily be picked up in the city but is
unobtainable in Moscow.

Moreover, this growth can to some extent be explained by rising
incomes, although "there are wide discrepancies." Indeed, "sometimes
people buy equipment because of prestige, others with middle incomes
because this is an area of their interest." What is clear, however, is
that the market is likely to "explode" once satellite-delivered Russian-
language channels (such as those due to launched by RTR this spring)
become widely available.

Like Teleset, General Satellite is involved in the cable industry and
is currently reconstructing networks in St Petersburg for the city
authorities. It also has a mobile uplink station for Eutelsat and
manufactures dishes; total dish sales average around 2,000 a month and
Hot Bird systems sold by the company usually retail for between $260
and $280.

Drozdetski expects cable and DTH markets in Russia to "go the way of
Poland" and expand significantly over the next few years. However,
while remaining free of "government interference," they are still
likely to be hampered by such factors as viewers' low incomes and there
being "not enough Russian-language programmes for individual systems
and cable networks."

PUBCASTER PLANS 'RUSSIAN SKY'

While Eutelsat is undoubtedly opening up the Russian market, the
national public broadcaster RTR is also well placed to make a major
impact with the launch of the country's first digital satellite-
delivered service from Intelsat 604.

According to Stanislav Bunievich, the station's deputy chairman and
director of engineering, RTR Network is a joint venture with an unnamed
UK partner, though rumoured to be BSkyB, and will launch - at a cost of
between $10 to $15 million (#6.6-#10 million) for equipment alone - two
channels (sport and movies) this spring. Distributed by Intelsat 604,
they will probably be followed by further channels for medical,
business and children's television and be available to an audience of
some 40 million "collective customers" - such as those served by cable
networks - throughout the former Soviet Union.

Bunievich says the idea behind RTR Network is to introduce viewers to
the idea of paying for their programming, which in his view is now "the
main way for the development of television in Russia." It is also an
attempt to make the broadcaster less dependent on the government for
its funding and lessen the burden of having to pay 75 per cent of its
revenue to the ministry of telecommunications for the use of
transmission facilities.

Although RTR is currently negotiating agreements with several foreign
programme-providers, Bunievich reckons a need for Russian material will
have to be met. He also believes there will be exceptionally strong
interest shown in the new service's children's and medical channels and
that within the next two to five years RTR, though remaining state-
owned, will become a holding company for RTR Network and other
commercial ventures.

BEAR ON A WIRE

While Moscow's mayor attempts to bring the city's maze of cable
networks under the control of the municipality, MMDS operator Kosmos is
thriving. Can wired and wireless co-exist? Chris Dziadul reports

Although cable remains a relatively underdeveloped industry in the
Russian Federation, there are numerous networks - including such
professional systems as Nika TV in Petrozavorsk around the country.
Wireless cable is a more recent arrival -  but already there are
several MMDS services operated by the US's ITI. But events now taking
place in Moscow are likely to have a major bearing on the future of
both sectors.

Viewers in the capital can for a monthly fee of around R3,300 (#0.47)
currently receive 11 terrestrial channels, of which only six - ORT,
RTR, NTV, 2x2, TV6 Moscow and TV5 St Petersburg - are distributed by
VHF signals. While this allows them to be carried by the city's 80-plus
cable networks, all of which are designed for VHF and have a limited
capacity, the remaining five UHF services, including CNN on Channel 24
and AMTV on Channel 27, can only be received by viewers able to afford
expensive aerials.

This may change shortly, however, following the issue of a decree by
Juri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, requiring all cable operators in the
city to effectively unite into a single network serving some 3.5
million households. In an attempt to stave-off the high levels of
piracy currently found in the industry, Moscow Municipal Cable
Television (MMCTV), which in theory came into being on November 5, will
see large percentages of its airtime given over to official material
(such as local news) and unified programming, with only a limited
amount being allowed for current cable operators' own output.

The move has in effect seen the city authorities claim ownership of all
the networks' wires buried under Moscow, which had up until now been
assumed to belong to local prefectures. It has also led to the creation
of a municipal channel which will have time slots allocated to several
parties, including Moscow's UHF Channel 15 and the production company
NKT.

The creation of MMCTV will, in addition, present an opportunity to
upgrade the city's existing systems. Mostly serving between 3,000 to
15,000 households, few are able to offer viewers more than seven
channels and nearly all are unprofitable.

While it is still unclear who may undertake this work, one of the most
favoured candidates is likely to be Mosteletechnic Corp, the city of
Moscow government's principal contractor. According to Sergei
Samokhvalov, its owner and general director, the company first
approached the authorities in 1991 with an offer to construct new
networks using western technology which would overcome all the
deficiencies of existing systems. This was accepted and accompanied by
a grant of $700,000 for a pilot project serving some 15,000 households.

Due for completion this January, it is also backed by Business Sviaz,
the General Centre for Radio and Television (GCRT-Ostankino), Mir (a
holding company which transmits digital TV/telephony signals via
Intelsat) and Comstar (a joint venture between the UK telecoms company
GPT and Moscow City Telephone Network (MGTS)) and will have enough
capacity for 60 channels. The 30 initially offered to subscribers -
upon payment of $150 for an addressable converter - will be divided
into three packages: basic - 11 terrestrial channels for $0.70 to $1 a
month; commercial - 16 channels including one operated by the city of
Moscow government for $6 to $8 a month; and two pay-per-view channels
for an unspecified fee. The cost of constructing the whole network,
excluding the headend, has been estimated to be $30 per subscriber and
this is expected to fall to $20 to $22 for any future projects.

Samokhvalov says Mosteletechnic has signed agreements with a number of
programmers, including NBC Super Channel, MTV Europe and Turner
International, and will be able to transmit their channels free of
charge for six months. During this time it will undertake a market
survey to determine which channels are most popular with its
subscribers, who in turn will not have to pay for their converters
until the survey is completed.

He adds that the idea behind the project was to develop one of the
first ever integrated cable networks in the Russian Federation.
Although it has taken four years and the help of General Instrument
(GI) to construct, Mosteletechnic now has a close working relationship
with the US company and recently approached the ministry of
telecommunications with an offer to provide integrated equipment for
the new Moscow-wide cable network MMCTV. In Samokhvalov's view, the
company will both secure the right to do so and also act as a
distributor for GI throughout the whole country.

Furthermore, while its pilot network will initially offer only cable
services, these are likely to be supplemented with digital telephony
and data later this year. The project will, in effect, aim to
"demonstrate the possibilities" for similar schemes being undertaken in
the cities of Minsk, Erevan, Baku, Bishek, Alma Ata, Dushanbe and St
Petersburg. It is looking for investors and has held talks with several
parties, including the EBRD.

Another, potentially competing part of the industry showing strong
signs of growth is the MMDS, or wireless cable sector. MMDS TV services
first appeared on the territory of the former Soviet Union shortly
after the collapse of communism. Backed by the US company International
Telcell Inc (ITI) - itself a consortium of several companies including
Metromedia, McCaw Cellular, Comsat Video Enterprises and Morgan and
Associates - it can now be found in the cities of Riga (Latvia),
Kishinov (Moldavia) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), along with Moscow, Nizny
Novogrod and, from early 1996, St Petersburg in the Russian Federation.

Although some such as Baltcom in Riga can claim success purely on the
grounds of subscriber numbers - over 8,000 in the Baltic republic's
capital alone - the most lucrative in terms of potential reach and
profitability is undoubtedly Moscow's Kosmos TV. Launched as a joint
venture between ITI and the General Centre for Radio and Television
(GCRT Ostankino) in 1991, it employs three large antennas to receive
Astra, Eutelsat and Intelsat services which are then retransmitted
within a 60-70km radius of the Ostankino TV Tower to the city of Moscow
and several outlying suburbs including Krasnogorsk, Kurkino, Odintsovo,
Peredelkino and Sheremetyevo.

Kosmos TV offers its subscribers - who currently number around 1,500
individuals and institutions such as businesses, hotels and embassies -
a full basic 18-channel 'package A' comprised Eurosport, MTV Europe,
RTL, Bloomberg, Bloomberg News, NBC Super Channel, a recently-launched
Russian film channel known as The New Channel and two services
(Euronews and The Travel Channel) with Russian subtitles for $36.45
(including VAT) per month. Those wishing to receive  the nine-channel
basic 'package B' of Russian and English-language channels, however,
pay $19 (including VAT) a month, while the Adult Channel is available
to all subscribers for an extra $8. Individual subscribers are, in
addition, required to pay a $300 deposit and $60 (plus VAT)
installation charge, while fees for hotels are determined by occupancy
rates.

Unlike most other cable operators in the Russian Federation, Kosmos TV
has full agreements with all the satellite channels it carries. It also
offers subscribers insurance for equipment, its own listings magazine,
a round-the-clock maintenance service and - perhaps more importantly -
a distinct advantage over individual DTH reception, since this would
require a two to 2.5-metre dish costing $1,500 to $3,000 and, for such
channels as BBC Prime, Discovery Channel and MTV Europe, up to $360 for
descrambling equipment.

According to Elvira Smirnova, Kosmos TV's commercial director, the
service would like to add more channels to those it already distributes
but is held back by "technical limitations." If these are overcome "the
number of subscribers will grow accordingly," she says, and may
eventually reach its target of 50,000.

FIRST TO SHOW

Europe's first single-sport subscription channel is covering not
football, but the sport of kings. Julian Clover dons his silks to give
a right royal welcome to The Racing Channel

There can't be too many satellite subscription services which claim Her
Majesty The Queen and other prominent members of Britain's royal family
as regular viewers. But SIS, owner of the Racing Channel, one of the
new crop of UK Astra channels and televisual purveyor of the 'sport of
kings,' boasts exactly this.

Strictly speaking, the Royal household doesn't subscribe to the #20 a
month Astra 1D service, but Britain's first family of the paddock is
the recipient of SIS's sister satellite racing service which is
targeted, predominantly, at bookmakers.

SIS actually began its encrypted (in B Mac) service for UK betting
shops as long ago as 1987, with live horse racing from Chester and
greyhound meetings from Hackney. Now offered to bookmakers and
individual trainers for an annual subscription fee of #5,500, George
Irvine, general manager of The Racing Channel, says when the
professional service first got under starter's orders "we came to an
agreement with Customs and Excise that we wouldn't, because it was a
betting service, sell it to individuals unless we were fairly sure that
they wouldn't start operating a betting shop in their front rooms."

There are now less than 500 such private subscriptions - including the
Royals' - in addition to the 9,500 UK betting shops. Transmissions via
Intelsat's 601 satellite are also received as far afield as Andorra,
North America and Saudi Arabia.

Irvine says that a consumer DTH service had long been under
consideration, but only recently did all the technological elements
fall into place to make the channel a racing certainty. The channel's
introduction was hastened when SIS's feed on Eutelsat I F4 switched to
digital transmissions, allowing additional compressed capacity to
deliver a proposed cable service to headends in the UK.

"We presented it to the cable companies with our thoughts and ideas of
what the service would consist of, the fact it was cable-exclusive, and
how we felt it would be a tremendous benefit to them, and how most of
the customers would be the kind who, through betting, would use
telephony as well. It was a 'double whammy,'" recounts Irvine.

But what was hoped to be a red-hot favourite stalled as cable operators
proved "very, very unreceptive." Irvine ascribes cable operators'
resistance to the channel to "technical problems" experienced with
existing channels.

The Racing Channel's unlikely White Knight turned out to be British Sky
Broadcasting, which came knocking on SIS's door with a proposal to
launch the service direct-to-home via satellite. However, the UK's
dominant pay-TV broadcaster was not able to guarantee SIS the 24-hour
channel it had been hoping for. Instead, it was offered, and accepted,
the daily transmission hours between 11.00 and 16.00 sharing capacity
with Sky Movies Gold on Astra 1D. However, from the summer of '96 The
Racing Channel will be able to extend its output to 19.00, before
returning to a 17.00 closedown in time for the start of the autumn
season.

SIS's cameras are in attendance at every daily race meeting in the UK
and from this wealth of coverage two meetings per day are selected for
the direct-to-home service.

An additional detail in the contract with Sky means SIS now produces
the daily Racing News magazine programme for Sky Sports, while The
Winning Post, another SIS production, returns in the summer on the same
channel with regular coverage of evening race meetings. Also during the
summer months, The Racing Channel will preview evening meetings and
screen the first few races before handing over to Sky Sports for
coverage of the remainder of the card.

Irvine concedes that the present hours are a mite miserly should, for
example, The Racing Channel, wish to screen an entire meeting. However,
since the key race is typically third on the card, coverage of the main
event is virtually guaranteed.

At #20 per month The Racing Channel ranks as the second most expensive
single premium service beamed via the Astra platform - a short head
behind JSTV's #30-a-month Japanese-language channel. Irvine, though,
says the figure should be put into perspective; #20, he says, might not
be quite so outlandish to punters who think nothing of placing bets of
#10 on a single race - though he says the average is closer to #50 -
via a credit or debit card.

"One of the good things is that you can subscribe to The Racing Channel
as a solos subscriber. You don't need to take any of the other
channels, and that was one of the things that we insisted on," says
Irvine. The implication is that BSkyB would have preferred The Racing
Channel's subscribers to have first passed through one of its existing
tiers, most likely Sky Sports.

But as evidence that SIS was correct to stick to its guns, Irvine
claims reports from Sky's subscriber management centre in Livingston
show that the enquiries have been streaming in from non-Sky customers.

The Racing Channel's deal with Sky was not hammered out until the
eleventh hour - last November 2 to be exact, four days before the
channel went live - and the agreement to use Sky's Astra 1D transponder
on the morning of the launch. Pre-launch ballyhoo, as a result, was
kept to a minimum to say the least, though in the time since ads have
regularly appeared in The Sporting Life and The Racing Post. And in
true pay-TV style, a daily clear window between 11.00 and 12.00 alerts
potential subscribers to the service.

In its first fortnight on-air The Racing Channel, Irvine claims,
attracted 20,000 calls and 7,500 switch-ons. Niche audience channels
inevitably attract consumers new to satellite television and this, in
turn, means acquainting them with the technology. The Racing Channel's
task is compounded, says Irvine, by the need among longer-standing
satellite viewers to fit "a new widget" - a reference to the enhanced
LNBs needed by many older IRDs to receive Astra 1D.

Providing such technicalities can be overcome, Irvine is targeting
30,000 subscribers for Year One and 10,000 by 1998. And despite the
original set-back with the UK's cable operators, the channel has even
been given a leg-up into cable by BT's London-based operator
Westminster Cable, which had taken part in some earlier consumer trials
of the channel.

When Sky migrates to digital - a deadline which is not expected to be
met until at least the end of 1996 - then The Racing Channel will
become a 24-hour service as was originally envisaged. But for the
moment, beams Irvine, "we're pleased that it is the first niche sports
channel, and it's racing."

DTH SURVEY:  HOW DOES YOUR MARKET GROW

In a year in which analogue equipment had the market all to itself for
the final time, saturation in Europe's major DTH markets suggests the
time is ripe for digital to take root. C&SEu's sixth annual DTH survey,
researched and compiled by Chris Dziadul

C&SEu's latest annual DTH survey indicates that the European satellite
industry had another successful year in 1995, with the number of
installations in December 1995 totalling around 20.5 million. Yet while
this represented an increase of over 20 per cent on the previous year's
figure, there were doubts in some countries as to how much longer this
growth could continue.

In Germany, for instance, sales had been stagnant for some two years
and dealers were finally being forced to concede that the market -
which already amounted to some nine million DTH and smatv homes - was
effectively saturated. In France, on the other hand, strong growth
could not conceal the fact that the industry was starting from an
extremely low base, while in Poland, which with an estimated 1.7
million dishes was still Europe's third largest market, cheap imports
were having a detrimental effect on sales.

All was not gloom and doom, however. Although BSkyB had had its fair
share of problems in the UK, it finally turned a corner in 1995 by
employing highly successful marketing techniques which helped the
number of installations rise above the 3.5 million mark - effectively a
17 per cent increase on the previous year's total. Other countries
which notched up significant sales included Italy, Belgium and Denmark.

The impact on Europe's DTH industry of Eutelsat's Hot Bird 1 - which is
co-located with ll F1 at 13 degrees East -  could not be understated
and was perhaps most clearly felt in the Russian Federation, where it
finally made viewing of foreign satellite channels a reality for
millions of people living in Moscow and central parts of the country.
Meanwhile in Greece, which had hitherto also been outside the
footprints of most European satellites, the number of installations
almost doubled following the satellite's launch.

Hot Bird also brought home the importance viewers now attach to local-
language programming. Although Astra is still undoubtedly Europe's 'hot
bird,' more and more people are forsaking its English and German-
language channels in favour of programming in their own vernaculars.
This is being offered by several satellites including Telecom 2A and 2B
in France, Turksat in Turkey and one degree West in Scandinavia, while
immigrant communities throughout the continent are increasingly well
served by Eutelsat's programming services.

What has, in addition, become clear is that each country in Europe is a
highly distinct market and developments in it should be viewed with
this in mind. The former communist countries of central and eastern
Europe, for instance, have seen their television industries develop at
widely differing rates over the last five years and this is clearly
reflected in their respective DTH markets. Even the Nordic countries,
which are united by common satellites and the usage of D2 Mac
technology, differ greatly in such areas as growth, with Sweden and
Denmark performing far more impressively than Finland and Norway.

Programming nevertheless remains a key factor in the development of DTH
services throughout Europe and its importance was clearly illustrated
in Belgium, where the sudden availability via satellite of the Dutch
broadcaster Veronica and newcomer SBS 6 contributed to an almost 75 per
cent increase in installations despite the country's high cable
penetration.

Spain, on the other hand, experienced both success and failure in this
field in 1995, with its Astra-delivered Canal Satellite package of
programming finally tasting success after an aggressive marketing
campaign and Cotelsat's four-channel package off of DBS bird Hispasat
collapsing due to lack of promotion, among other things.

Although the UK's Pace has emerged as a clear market-leader in DTH
equipment throughout Europe, its dominance is by no means complete and
is challenged in a number of territories. Cheap imports, however,
continue to trouble several markets, despite the problem being less
severe in some countries - Austria, for instance - than before.

As in previous years, it is instructive to compare growth in Europe's
DTH industry with those of Japan and the US, the world's two other main
satellite dish markets. In the former, satellite penetration of its
43.7 million TV households stood at around 13.7 per cent towards the
end of the year. Meanwhile in the US, the impetus provided by the
recent launch of such DBS services as DirecTv was maintained in 1995,
with the total number of DTH subscribers in October being 4.36 million
and the total number of C-Band dishes almost 3.83 million.

DTH SURVEY:  AUSTRIA

Population:        8.1m
TV homes:          3.035m
VCR homes:         1.75m
Cable connections: 1.17m
Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        300,000-500,000 (700,000)

Austria's DTH industry had a largely indifferent year in 1995, with few
if any distributors recording significant increases in sales of dishes.
There were nevertheless some important developments that offered a
valuable insight into how the market was likely to develop.

The cost of equipment, for instance, continued to fall and by the end
of the year the cheapest Astra systems - which employed 60cm dishes in
western parts of the country, rising to 80cm in Vienna and further east
- retailed for as little as oSch1,290 (#82). More typically, 80cm
models usually fetched up to oSch5,000 and motorised units around
oSch10,000.

Yet despite this, there was a movement away from sales of cheap 'black
imports' from such Asian countries as China and South Korea back to
more expensive equipment produced in the European Union (EU). Indeed,
companies such as Pace and Hirschmann, which had previously dominated
the quality end of the market, began to make significant inroads into
its mainstream.

While ascertaining the size of the market remained difficult -
estimates of the total number of dishes ranged from 300,000 to half a
million - most industry sources believed Eutelsat programming (thanks
largely to Hot Bird) was becoming increasingly popular in the country.

DTH SURVEY:  BELGIUM

Population:        10.2m
TV homes:          4.141m
VCR homes:         1.91m
Cable connections: 3.99m
Cable penetration: 96%
Dish total:        35,000 (20,000)

Belgium's high cable penetration did not prevent its hitherto small DTH
market almost doubling in size in 1995. The reasons for this were
twofold: the popularity of Eutelsat's Hot Bird and - perhaps more
importantly - the dramatic increase of programming available to Flemish
speakers via Veronica and SBS 6.

With sales of equipment to the country's immigrant Moroccan and Turkish
communities having peaked, the focus of attention once more passed to
the local population. Still effectively split along linguistic lines -
with French speakers in Wallonia opting for programming on Telecom and
Astra being the first choice for Flemish speakers - it saw the cost of
systems fall by around 15 per cent. As a result, typical Astra models
with 80cm dishes, along with 90cm Telecom equipment, typically retailed
for between BFr5,950 and BFr11,900 (#129-259).

With now no domestic manufacturing sector to speak of, all DTH
equipment was supplied by foreign companies. Several, including Amstrad
and Echostar, were well represented at the quality end of the market,
while Germany's Lasat performed well in sales of lower priced hardware.

DTH SURVEY:  BULGARIA

Population:        8.5m
TV homes:          2m (est)
VCR homes:         540,000
Cable connections: 60,000 (min est)
Cable penetration: 3% (min est)
Dish total:        N/A (50,000 est)

In the absence of a national commercial television service and a cable
industry still waiting on the starting blocks, Bulgaria's DTH market
had another good year in '95. Indeed, although industry sources were
unable to provide an accurate figure for the total number of dishes in
the country, it was believed to be well in excess of the 1994 figure of
50,000.

Astra programming could be received with equipment employing 1.5-metre
dishes in the western part of the country, rising to over three metres
on the Black Sea coast, which - if using increasingly popular Russian
ex-military dishes - typically retailed for around $325 (#206).
Eutelsat's Hot Bird, however, had become an instant hit and could be
picked up anywiere with generally cheaper systems (including receivers
costing around #63) which employed 1.2 metre dishes (80cm in Sofia).
Furthermore, services carried on other Eutelsat satellites remained
popular with the country's large Turkish-speaking community.

Although Pace equipment was highly regarded, its price put it beyond
the reach of most Bulgarians. However, there was a wide range of
foreign-made systems on the market and the end users' cost could often
be negotiated.

DTH SURVEY:  CIS

Population:        147.5m (Russia)

Dish total:        N/A (N/A)

Although there was still no reliable figure for the total number of
dishes in the CIS, it was widely believed that the market stood on the
threshold of great change. The reason for this was the availability of
programming hitherto difficult if not impossible to receive in the
territory: Eutelsat had reduced the dish size required to pick-up its
signals from three metres to 90cm following the launch of Hot Bird 1,
while Astra 1D's footprint was such that its programming services could
be viewed in Moscow with 75cm equipment.

With monitoring at borders kept to a minimum, there was a large influx
of illegally-imported DTH equipment from western Europe, the Middle
East, China and other parts of Asia.

Pace nevertheless remained one of the leading distributors of receiving
equipment in the country.

Cable penetration: negligible
Dish total:        200,000 (400,000 max est)

Croatia's DTH market in late 1995 appeared to be smaller than
previously believed, but it still amounted to around 200,000
installations - an impressive penetration rate of over 23 per cent -
and sales were increasing. This could largely be put down to an almost
complete absence of cable services in the country, except in the towns
of Karlovac, Split and the capital, Zagreb, along with a terrestrial
sector dominated by the national publicly-owned broadcaster Hrvatska
Televizija (HRT) and, following a new media communication law, awaiting
the launch of national and regional commercial services.

Channels on Astra and Eutelsat's Hot Bird accounted for most of the
country's satellite viewing, with systems for the former employing 60-
90cm dishes, typically retailing for #146. While there was no market-
leader, models produced by Pace, Provision and Grundig continued to
sell well.

Dish sales in the Czech Republic held up extremely well in 1995 despite
the continued popularity of the recently-launched commercial station TV
The trends which have recently manifested themselves in Norway's DTH
industry dominated by the Ostrava-based operator Cable Plus. Indeed,
some industry sources put the number of DTH installations in the
country in late 1995 at 600,000 - effectively a 50 per cent increase on
the previous year's total.

Astra still remained popular in the Czech Republic and could be
received with systems employing 60cm dishes almost anywhere in the
country and typically retailed for CKr7,000 (#169). Eutelsat equipment
cost a similar amount, while motorised systems were more expensive.

As in previous years, although there were no clear market-leaders both
Pace and Amstrad remained popular.

Population:        5.2m
TV homes:          2.266m
VCR homes:         1.45m
Cable connections: 1.359m (incl smatv)
Cable penetration: 60% (incl smatv)
Dish total:        Up to 300,000 (100,000 min est)

Denmark's DTH market experienced tremendous growth in 1995 and was by
the end of the year believed to number up to 300,000 installations. Of
these, aroune two thirds were accounted for by D2 Mac receiving
systems.

One reason for this increase in sales was the success of the pan-Scandi
satellite venture NSD, which effectively provided Danish cable and DTH
viewers with a realistic alternative to services carried by Astra.
While the latter remained attractive to viewers, channels on the one
degree West platform (which included TV3) rapidly gained in popularity.

The market was also given a boost by a significant fall in the cost of
equipment, with D2 Mac systems employing 70cm dishes, for instance,
typically retailing from DKr2,495-3,495 (#288-404). Those capable of
receiving both Astra and NSD services, meanwhile, cost around DKr4,000
if specifically designed to do so and DKr4,500 if they combined two
70cm dishes. Although Pal systems also continued to fall in price, they
remained far less popular.

As in previous years, Pace was the market-leader and Triax, Nokia and
Bang & Olufsen were also well represented.

Cable connections: 123,000
Cable penetration: 25% (max est)
Dish total:        21,000 (18,000 max est)

Estonia maintained its position as one of the Baltic region's leading
television markets in 1995, recording significant growth in both its
terrestrial and cable industries. As in previous years, it also saw a
sharp rise in the number of DTH homes: although the previous year's
figure was overestimated, the late 1995 total of 21,000 represented an
increase in real terms of 40 per cent.

Astra was the most watched satellite but faced stiff competition from
Eutelsat and Russia's Gorizont. Indeed, the top five satellite channels
received either by cable or DTH in the country were - according to
National Media Survey - Pro 7, ORT, RTL, MTV Europe and Eurosport.

The typical cost of DTH equipment -which usually employed a 1.8-metre
antenna and Pal receiver - was little changed at around EEK9,000 (#500)
and Pace, Finlux and Nokia/Salora remained the market-leaders.

Cable connections: 749,000 (est)
Cable penetration: 36%
Dish total:        50,000 (30,000)

The size of Finland's DTH market was revised upwards for the second
year running, though industry sources indicated there had been little
if any increase in sales in 1995. There was, however, an important
change in viewing habits as viewers began to switch from Astra to
Eutelsat's Hot Bird and the CTV package at one degree West.

Besides offering attractive programming, both new services could be
received with competitively priced equipment: systems with one-metre
dishes were sufficient to pick-up Hot Bird almost anywhere in the
country and typically retailed for FM1,200-1,900 (#178-292), while the
end-user cost of 70cm CTV models was FM1,900-2,900. Astra's decline in
popularity was nevertheless expected to be temporary, with several
digital services on its forthcoming 1E satellite likely to target
Scandinavian audiences.

In the absence of a local manufacturing industry - Nokia having shifted
production of both Pal and Mac receivers to Sweden - sales of equipment
were effectively confined to foreign-made systems. Pace and Nokia
(along with its brand names Salora and Finlux) each accounted for 30
per cent of the market, with several other companies the remainder.

VCR homes:         13.352m
Cable connections: 2.131m
Cable penetration: 10.2%
Dish total:        1m (min est) (385,000 est)

France's hitherto small DTH market caught up on lost time in 1995, with
one industry source estimating the number of dishes in the country at
the half-year point to be at least one million. It also put total sales
of equipment at 270,000 in 1994 and expected the figure to rise to
350,000 in 1995.

One reason for this impressive growth was demand from France's large
foreign community: Arabic, Spanish, English, Italian, German and Polish-
speakers all found programming on Eutelsat - and in particular Hot Bird
 - increasingly attractive, and by some estimates accounted for between
50 and 60 per cent of dish sales. Astra, on the other hand, was
considered by most of the French viewing public to be too geared
towards English and German-language speakers, with most still plumping
for Telecom satellites.

The latter (Telecom 2A and 2B) could be received with equipment which
typically retailed for Fr2,000 (#259), whereas Astra systems usually
cost less. As in previous years, the market-leaders included Philips
and Nokia.

Although it was expected dish sales in France in 1996 would reach
470,000, the effect on the market of Canal Plus's digital Astra package
remained hard to predict.

Population:        81.7m
TV homes:          32.149m
VCR homes:         18.968m
Cable connections: 15.491m
Cable penetration: 48.1%
Dish total:        9.23m (DTH & smatv) (7.71m, max est-DTH only)

Following two years of disappointing sales, dealers believed Germany's
DTH market had finally reached saturation point. Indeed, in a country
with over 14 million cabled homes and at least nine million served by
DTH or smatv, most were agreed that everyone who wanted to watch
satellite television now had the means to do so.

The slowdown in dish sales was uniform throughout Germany and not - as
first believed - confined to the more cabled, western part of the
country. It was also reflected in the cost of equipment, with the
cheapest 60cm Astra systems retailing for as little as #60-70 and dual
Astra/Eutelsat models (which usually employed 85cm dishes and two LNBs)
fetching #100.

With DTH equipment costing so little, imports from the Far East which
had previously made strong inroads into the market no longer had the
edge. As in previous years, producers of high-quality kit such as
Kathrein, Technisat and Pace maintained a strong presence in the
country.

DTH SURVEY:  GREECE

Population:        10.5m
TV homes:          3.161m
VCR homes:         1.58m
Cable connections: 1,900
Cable penetration: 0.06%
Dish total:        5,000 (est) (3,000)

Greece's small DTH market received a welcome boost in 1995 with the
launch of Eutelsat's Hot Bird and a fall in the cost of equipment. As a
result, there were around 5,000 systems in the country at the end of
the year (compared to 3,000 in late 1994) and sales were buoyant.

Signals from the new Eutelsat satellite - on which Eurosport was the
most popular channel - could be received almost anywhere in the country
with systems employing 80cm dishes. These usually retailed for between
#160-#226, whereas those used to pick-up other satellites could cost
anything from #400 (1.2-metres) to #2,700 (for the most expensive three-
metre model). Reception nevertheless remained a problem, with Greece's
geographical location effectively limiting Astra viewing to Corfu and
the north, and requiring 1.8-metre systems to watch Intelsat in Crete
and western parts of the country.

While there was still no market-leader, equipment supplied by Pace,
Amstrad and Echostar remained popular. Drake, Hirschmann and Kathrein,
however, continued to dominate sales of more expensive models.

Population:        10.2m
TV homes:          3.8m
VCR homes:         1.596m
Cable connections: 1.52m
Cable penetration: 40%
Dish total:        400,000 (max est) (190,000)

Previous estimates of the size of Hungary's DTH market appeared to have
been incorrect, with industry sources believing the number of dishes in
the country in late 1995 to be up to 400,000. Although this was almost
double the previous year's total, it was widely felt there had been
little if any growth in the market during the period.

There was also an acceptance that the country's television industry was
on the threshold of great change: a long-awaited broadcasting bill
seemed imminent and was likely to be followed by the launch of a
national commercial television service. How this would affect its DTH
and cable industries - the latter being one of the largest in central
and eastern Europe - remained far from clear.

The non-terrestrial sector had nevertheless been given a boost during
the previous year by the launch of MultiChoice Hungary. In late 1995
subscribers could receive the basic package - upon payment of Fts35,000-
45,000 (#167-215) for hardware and a connection fee of Fts5,200 - for
Fts29,990 a month. Both Astra and Eutelsat programming remained popular
in the country, with systems employing 0.9 to three-metre dishes
ranging in price from #71-#390. Although there were no clear market-
leaders, equipment produced by several companies, including Pace,
Amstrad, Neuhaus, Radix and Echostar, continued to sell well.

VCR homes:         49,500 (est)
Cable connections: 1,216 (min est)
Cable penetration: 1.3%
Dish total:        3,000 (max est) (2,500)

The number of dishes in Iceland grew steadily in 1995 and at the end of
the year stood at around 3,000. Although this represented an impressive
increase of up to 20 per cent on the previous year's total, industry
sources were far from optimistic as to the future.

The key to any further growth in the market rested firmly with
programming: while the introduction of microwave relays of foreign
channels by Stod 2 had failed to dampen sales of DTH equipment and the
prospect of the PTT offering cable services still seemed distant, most
people felt the (legal) viewing choice on offer was limited.

Nor was their view likely to be altered by the cost of equipment in a
market in which - despite the presence of such companies as Pace and
Echostar - there was still no dominant supplier. Indeed, 1995 saw
typical 1.2-metre Astra systems with IRDs fall in price by IKr5,000
(#49) from IKr60,000 to IKr55,000, while 1.8-metre systems normally
used to receive such channels as CNN and (illegally) Sky Sports also
dropped in price by a similar amount to IKr110,000. Neither had the
effect of raising the total annual sales beyond 300 to 500
installations.

Cable connections: 401,280
Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        66,000 (min est) (60,000)

Ireland's DTH market shrugged off high cable penetration, widespread
MMDS distribution and the illegal retransmission of foreign channels to
record significant growth for the second year running. This was in part
due to a large influx of illegally-imported equipment and the
widespread use of pirate cards.

Viewing patterns were little altered, however, with Astra programming
by far the most popular and neither Eutelsat or Intelsat being able to
secure a large audience. The cost of equipment was also little changed
on 1994: the cheapest Astra models with 80cm dishes typically retailed
for IR#199 (#194.6), while more expensive systems could fetch up to
IR#350.

Pace remained the market-leader, with several other manufacturers
including Lenson Heath and Grundig represented.

Israel's cable industry had another highly successful year in 1995,
with the number of connected homes rising to over 840,000 (effectively
70 per cent penetration). Most were offered six Hebrew-language
channels, over 25 foreign services and home shopping.

Yet despite this, the country's small DTH market not only held its own
but recorded an increase in sales. Industry sources believed it
numbered around 5,000 systems in late 1995: most belonged to Arabs
resident in the Occupied Territories or Israel proper and were used to
receive programming via Eutelsat, Asiasat and Arabsat, with the
latter's Arab Radio and Television (ART) being especially popular.

Equipment employing 0.9-metre dishes typically retailed for NS1,500
(#314), while 1.1-metre systems cost an additional NS200 and motorised
units could fetch up to NS3,500. All prices included both VAT and
installation. As in previous years, Pace remained the clear market-
leader at the medium-to-high end of the market and no single company
dominated sales of lower-priced equipment.

Italy's DTH market grew significantly for the second year running in
1995, with some industry sources putting the number of dishes in the
country at up to 600,000. It also looked forward to a period of further
growth following the 1996 launch of Hot Bird 2 - which will boost sales
in southern parts of the country by allowing reception with 85cm dishes
- and Telepiu's move onto satellite.

Astra and Eutelsat's Hot Bird were the most watched satellites in the
country at the end of the year and could usually be received with 85cm
systems, which ranged in price from between Lire300,000-550,000 (#119-
219) for single and Lire450,000-700,000 for double feeds. 1.2-metre
motorised units, however, could fetch anything up to Lire2.8 million.

As in previous years, the principal suppliers of DTH equipment included
Nokia, Pace, Fracarro, Echostar and Emmesse.

No accurate figure for the total number of dishes in Latvia in late
1995 was available,  though some industry sources estimated there could
be almost 25,000, giving a penetration rate of almost two per cent.
What was clear, however, was that growth in the industry continued to
be held back by the country's expanding terrestrial sector and -
perhaps more importantly - the success of the Riga-based MMDS service
Baltcom. Backed by the US company International Telecell Inc (ITI) and
local interests, it offered at least 8,000 subscribers in the city and
environs 24 channels in three packages.

Some industry sources believed the previous year's total of 265,000 to
be an overestimate. With continued expansion of terrestrial services
and a cable industry estimated to number up to 70,000 connections,
however, there was undoubtedly general growth in the country's
television market and, most probably, dish sales, though no reliable
figure was available.

While programming carried by Astra and Intelsat remained popular,
Eutelsat's Hot Bird made viewing of satellite channels financially more
accessible to the public and was likely to eventually result in the
same growth in the DTH industry as in the neighbouring Russian
Federation.

Luxembourg's DTH market continued to expand in 1995, though industry

limit further growth for the foreseeable future.

As in previous years, programming supplied by Astra - whose operator
SES is based in the Grand Duchy - continued to dominate viewing and
could be received with equipment which retailed for as little as
FLux4,000 (#87). More expensive motorised systems, on the other hand,
could be bought from around FLux17,500. While Alfa J Weirich Sar
remained the country's only DTH manufacturer, several foreign companies
including Grundig were strongly represented in the local market.

DTH SURVEY:  NETHERLANDS

Population:        15.5m
TV homes:          6.4m
VCR homes:         4.096m
Cable connections: 5.824m
Cable penetration: 91%
Dish total:        280,000 (250,000)

Although the launch of several new channels on satellite, including
SBS6, TV10 Gold and a revamped Veronica, made 1995 an eventful year for
Dutch broadcasting, sales of DTH equipment remained sluggish due to the
country's already high cable penetration. Moreover, they were not
expected to increase significantly in the near future despite Nethold's
plans to target the country with digital pay-per-view.

The Netherlands' large Turkish and Moroccan immigrant communities
continued to account for most low-cost equipment sales, with many
models being used to receive channels carried by Eutelsat and - to a
lesser extent - Arabsat and Intelsat. The cheapest Astra and Eutelsat
models usually employed 60-80cm dishes and typically retailed for
Gld200-300 (#79-119). While Pace remained the market-leader, Amstrad
and Echostar both had a significant market share and Philips continued
to enjoy a degree of success.

Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        220,000 (200,000)

The trends which have recently manifested themselves in Norway's DTH
market - namely a switch from motorised to fixed systems and a
significant fall in prices - continued almost unabated in 1995. The
latter was to some degree spurred on by the success of the one degree
West package, which prompted MultiChoice to enter into an agreement
with Pace that resulted in hardware becoming available to the pay
channel's subscribers for as little as NKr3,000 (#304). This cost
eventually became the norm for multi-Mac equipment and represented a 66
per cent reduction on 1994 price levels.

Although Nokia remained the market-leader, Pace's deal with FilmNet
strengthened its presence in the country and several other companies,
including Philips, remained well represented. The local manufacturers
Stop and Tantec, however, remained largely on the sidelines.

DTH SURVEY:  POLAND

Population:        38.6m

While Poland maintained its position as Europe's third largest DTH
market in 1995, it continued to be troubled by a development that took
place in February of the previous year. The event in question was the
government's decision to impose a 10 per cent 'luxury tax' on all
Polish-made systems (15 per cent on imports) and inadvertently plunge
the whole local industry into a crisis. Besides creating a black market
that accounted for at least 70 per cent of all DTH equipment sold in
the country, its action led to a fall in the number of official dealers
and left those remaining uncertain about their future.

Their predicament was clearly borne out by the cost of equipment, with
the cheapest Astra systems sold - typically for around Zl440 (#113.4) -
being equivalent in price to illegally-imported Pace models.

Yet while the market continued to grow, the halcyon days of the early
1990s were clearly over: more choice of local-language programming led
to Astra gradually losing viewers to terrestrial services and - perhaps
more significantly - Eutelsat. Indeed, at the end of the year
Eutelsat's share of the market (thanks largely to Hot Bird) had risen
to 10 per cent and industry sources predicted it could reach 50 per
cent if more Polish-language channels became available.

With Pace equipment still popular at the higher price end of the
market, and no one supplier dominating sales of cheaper models, the
time seemed right for a local company to enter the fray.

Poznan-based Astra-TV took the plunge by producing the country's first
integrated satellite receiver-positioner and - following the launch of
other new products - aimed to eventually capture up to 70 per cent of
the local market.

Cable penetration: negligible
Dish total:        100,000 (min est) (100,000)

There was little agreement on the fortunes of Portugal's DTH market in
1995, with some dealers believing it had finally turned the corner
after bearing the brunt of the country's economic recession and others
feeling it was still far from out of the woods. What was clear,
however, was that it faced growing competition from both the
terrestrial sector and newly-emerging cable industry.

Although Astra remained popular, it too faced competition from
Eutelsat's Hot Bird, which, arguably, offered Portuguese viewers more
interesting programming. Both could be received with 85cm systems
costing as little as Esc20,000 (#85), though more typically Esc50,000.
Combined Eutelsat/Astra models employed 1.1-metre dishes and could be
bought for a little extra.

As in previous years, Antel and Famavel remained the leading local
manufacturers, while the largest distributors included Cintra & Leal,
Contera, Televes, Grundig, Prosat and TV Babo.

Although Romanian dealers were unable to provide a figure for the total
number of DTH installations in the country in late 1995,  it was likely
to be only slightly higher than the previous year's maximum estimate of
300,000. While Hot Bird had undoubtedly had a positive impact on the
market, the impressive growth which followed the overthrow of
Ceausescu's regime in 1989 had long ended and domestic television
services were transformed beyond all recognition. Indeed, besides
having a vibrant terrestrial sector served by a growing number of local
commercial stations, the country had one of the largest cable
industries in the whole of central and eastern Europe, with some
estimates putting the number of connections at up to 1.8 million.

Serbia and Montenegro's DTH market showed further signs of growth in
1995 and at the end of the year stood at around 200,000 installations.

Although Astra programming remained extremely popular, Eutelsat's Hot
Bird was watched by a significant number of viewers and both Intelsat
and Turksat also had large followings.

The cheapest Astra models (which accounted for up to 80 per cent of the
market) retailed for as little as DM250-300 (#112-135), while Hot Bird
systems (some 20 per cent of sales) were motorised and fetched DM600-
700. Although as in previous years there was no overall market-leader,
Neuhausat, Teletronik, Telemax and Protek were well represented in
sales of receivers and Cambridge of LNBs.

Slovakia's television industry has been slower to develop than that of
most other former communist countries in central and eastern Europe,
but the recent award of a national commercial licence is likely to have
a positive effect on its future.

In the absence of such a service, however, both the country's cable and
satellite industries have prospered and in late 1995 there were at
least 350,000 cable connections and 100,000 DTH homes. The latter could
receive both Astra and Eutelsat programming (including Hot Bird) using
equipment which typically retailed for SKr10-11,000 (#214-236).

While there were still no market-leaders, systems including receivers
supplied by Pace were increasingly favoured.

Although the previous year's figure for the total number of dishes in
Slovenia appeared to be an underestimate, most industry sources felt
the market had finally reached saturation point. Indeed, hampered by a
rapidly expanding cable and terrestrial sector, along with high duties
and a tide of illegally-imported equipment, it was likely to remain in
the doldrums for some time to come.

With the number of installations believed to be up to 150,000, however,
Slovenia could still boast an impressive satellite penetration rate of
some 23 per cent. Astra remained popular and could be received with 80-
85cm equipment which - if bought on the black market - retailed for as
little as DM280 (#126), rising to DM350 including installation in the
case of legal low-cost models. Eutelsat systems also employed 85cm
dishes and cost slightly more, while Italian channels on Intelsat could
be received with motorised 1.2-metre systems typically costing around
DM1,300.

While there was still no market-leader, equipment supplied by Pace,
Echostar and Technisat continued to sell well.

Dish total:        225,000 (min est) (210,000 max est)

1995 was a year of mixed fortunes for the Spanish DTH market. On the
one hand it could reflect on the success of Astra's Canalsatelite
package - which thanks to aggressive marketing passed the 25,000
subscriber mark - and look forward to Hispasat's plans to launch a
string of digital services in the near future. On the other, it had to
face up to the abysmal failure of the Cotelsat subscriber management
consortium, which managed to secure only 4,000 subscribers for its four-
channel Hispasat package before collapsing in the summer.

Although it was hoped a local DTH market would eventually emerge, sales
of equipment were still largely confined to the country's large
expatriate community. Many continued to favour programming on Astra,
which could be received with 60cm systems in the north, rising to 80cm
in the central region and 1.5-metres in the south, and - due to strong
competition - retailed for as little as Ptas49,000 (#254) in such towns
as Malaga, though up to Ptas100,000 in places with fewer foreign
residents. Scandinavians, however, generally opted to watch a wider
variety of programming, including channels carried by the new, highly-
successful one degree West satellite.

While there was still no market-leader, in the country, Pace and
several minor brand names were all well represented.

Dish total:        475,000 (max est) (385,000)

Sales of DTH equipment remained strong in Sweden in 1995 despite the
country's high cable and smatv penetration. They were nevertheless
influenced by a train of events that got under way in August 1994 with
the launch of the Sirius package.

Offering four Pal channels (TV3, TV4, TV6 and ZTV) in-the-clear, the
services provided a boost for sales of compatible equipment until an
announcement in mid-1995 which revealed that they would all soon be
encrypted. This effectively spelt the end of stand-alone Pal reception
equipment market in Sweden and by late 1995 sales were almost entirely
confined to Mac systems.

Costs were little changed on 1994, however, with standard D2 Mac
equipment retailing for around SKr4,000 (#381) including VAT. More
popular Nordic package systems (one degree West and five degrees East)
including a 70cm dish and double LNB, however, fetched between SKr4,500-
5,000.

Figures released by the Swedish Association of Antenna Suppliers (CANT)
indicated that Finnish manufacturer Nokia and its associate companies
had a market share of up to 41 per cent. Other suppliers which were
strongly represented in the Swedish marketplace included Triax,
Amstrad, Philips and Pace.

Most industry sources felt Switzerland's DTH market was larger than
previously believed - with some estimates putting the total number of
dishes in the country at up to 120,000 - but they could not agree on
whether it was growing or relatively static.

Those serving the French-speaking community - effectively 40 per cent
of the population - nevertheless had some cause for optimism: besides
being able to reflect on the success of Telecom, they could look
forward to the launch of Canal Plus on Astra in early 1996.

Yet, while Eutelsat also had a large following (especially among the
country's expatriate communities), Astra channels remained the most
popular and could be received with 80cm systems which retailed for at
least SFr300 (#168). More expensive systems, however, could cost
viewers up to SFr1,200.

In the absence of a local production industry, several foreign
companies were well represented in Switzerland's DTH market. They
included Pace, Echostar and Technisat.

Sales of DTH systems rose significantly in Turkey in 1995 and towards
the end of the year were peaking at around 100,000 a month. Although
they were largely confined to rural areas and coincided with the
increased seasonal buying power of the local population, they also
pointed to a number of important developments in the Turkish market.

The most important of these was undoubtedly the rising popularity of
Turksat, which offered viewers over 10 Turkish-language channels,
including the pay-TV service Cine 5. Both these and Eutelsat's Turkish
services attracted a growing audience outside the main cities, which
were already served by numerous terrestrial broadcasters.

The cost of equipment, though little changed on 1994, also attracted
buyers from Syria, Iraq and Iran who subsequently supplied the DTH
markets of their countries. The cheapest Turksat equipment employed a
60cm dish and usually retailed for around $200 (including cable and
installation), while Hot Bird (90cm/1.2-metre) and general Eutelsat
(1.2/1.5-metre) systems cost more.

Cost was in fact the determining factor and as a result there was no
clear market-leader. However, receivers produced in the Far East by
Galaxy and Calibre sold well, while Raster and Laser Merih remained
among the country's own leading dish manufacturers.

DTH SURVEY:  UK

Population:        58.6m
TV homes:          22.402m
VCR homes:         16.488m
Cable connections: 3.181m (incl smatv)
cable penetration: 14.2% (incl smatv)
Dish total:        3.504m (3m)

The UK's DTH market ended 1995 on a strong note, with figures released
by Continental Research indicating that the number of installations in
the country had risen to over 3.5 million - effectively a 17 per cent
increase on the previous year's total.

This welcome upturn in what was, despite a recent slowdown in sales,
Europe's second largest DTH market could largely be put down to the
highly successful marketing techniques employed by BSkyB. While one in
three UK sales were admittedly to replace existing systems, viewers
could buy a receiver and dish for as little as #99 plus #30
installation (the former normally cost between #150-250) providing they
agreed to subscribe to the whole Sky package - including premium movie
and sports channels - for #24.99 a month. As a further incentive, they
were also given access to free sports and movies channels for six
months after signing up.

The UK market was also buoyed by the launch of several new channels
into Sky's 'basic' Multi-Channels tier. The introduction of Sci-Fi
channel, The History Channel, Sky Sports Gold, Paramount TV and
European Business News (EBN) to the Astra-delivered package brought
with it an increase from #9.99 per month to #10.99, but this didn't
seem to deter the market. New premium services Playboy, The Racing
Channel and The Disney Channel, which was offered free to subscribers
to Sky's film channels, also created extra publicity and marketing
support for the UK's main 'dish-driver.'

While Pace remained the market-leader, it faced strong competition from
several other companies, including Grundig Satellite Communications.
The latter had enjoyed considerable success since its launch in early
1994, while Amstrad, which at one time was the leading player in the
industry, continued to experience a downturn in its fortunes.

While the cost of analogue DTH equipment was significantly down on
previous years, the predicted price of digital receivers  - a hefty
#400-500 - was seen as a factor in BSkyB's decision to delay the
introduction of digital satellite television services, probably until
late 1996 or 1997.

47 VARIETIES

By applying the logic of digital to analogue Astra transponder 47,
reports Julian Clover, Sky has been improving its standing in
Continental Research's Star Report

Just how many channels is it possible to squeeze into a single
transponder? This is not a question involving bit rates for the
imminent digital era, but one which remains firmly in the analogue
domain, at least as far as Sky is concerned.

Astra transponder 47 is home to a fistful of Sky television services;
Sky Soap, Sky Travel, The History Channel, Sci-Fi Channel, Sky Sports
Gold, Sky Sports 2 and the 'non-aligned' Christian Channel. All are
proudly described by Sky as 'channels,' though only Sky Sports 2 is on-
air for a period longer than 16 hours - and that for only two
consecutive days. Some of these 'programme streams' are either owned or
controlled by BSkyB, while others, such as Sci-Fi, are merely sitting
tenants, albeit for only several hours at a time.

However, the sum of these various parts amounts to a more than
respectable, if variable product. The popularity of Sky Sports 2, for
instance, rests largely on whether its full-time sister channel is
screening an event which requires its normal football coverage to be
shunted across. And as BSkyB racks up the rights to more and more
events in the sporting calendar - Endsleigh league football has become
the latest - then Sports 2 will enjoy a greater share of the
recognition.

Sports though isn't the only audience-grabber on transponder 47; co-
habitor Sci-Fi has been performing remarkably well for a channel which
has only nine weekly hours of prime-time. A round-the-clock version is
available  for cable viewers only via Eutelsat, but this is not audited
by Continental Research's Star Report.

Sci-Fi Channel's opening programme, Inside Space, ranks ninth in the
list of top-rated transponder 47 programmes, while its first big movie,
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, came in at fifth position, despite
having been aired on several occasions by terrestrial television. The
audience level for Khan and, to a lesser extent, Alien are on a par
with movies screened by UK Gold - which, arguably, has the best crop of
movies of any basic channel.

The History Channel also has an audience to be proud of; at 109,000 its
top-rated programme would not look out of place in The Discovery
Channel's top 10, which begs the question what could it achieve if its
transmission hours were extended beyond 19.00?

Outside of the all-singing, all-dancing transponder 47, the other
newcomers to Sky's tiers have enjoyed a mixed response. Bravo's noon-to-
midnight cult television service is now sandwiched between business
news channel EBN (06.00-12.00) and Playboy channel (00.00-04.00).

EBN's audience is hard to quantify; by its very nature most of its
viewing takes place in City dealing rooms. But it also has a 24-hour
feed on Eutelsat Hot Bird 1, allowing direct-to-home viewing and, more
importantly cable retransmission, which is not necessarily included in
Bravo's viewing combo. The rows of zeros notched up by EBN during its
daily Astra transmission hours also belies an upswing in the number of
ABC1 viewers to Bravo's Astra transponder.

CAPE BLAZE HITS DSTV ROLL-OUT

A SERIOUS fire at the Cape Town factory producing Panasonic MPEG-2/DVB
receivers for MultiChoice's recently-launched DSTV service has worsened
an already severe shortage of boxes.

The fire, started by an electrical fault, caused R30 million (#5.31
million) worth of damage, destroying the production line from which
Panasonic was hoping to deliver 35,000 digital boxes before the end of
the year.

According to MultiChoice general manager, marketing, Cobus Scholtz,
Panasonic is hoping to restore full production by the end of January:
but he confirmed the fire had "severely affected" early roll-out
targets for the 16-channel DTH service.

Although Pace has pledged to step-up deliveries to supply "20-25,000"
DSTV receivers before Christmas, Scholtz said, "We had hoped to have
that many in the market right now." To date, he said, some 5,500 Pace
units had been delivered, along with "two to three thousand" from
Panasonic. Because of the shortages, MultiChoice is in talks with the
consortium launching a German-language digital package for Africa, with
a view to joint marketing of a Grundig digital IRD suitable for both
services. Rumours that Nokia boxes might also be shipped in to relieve
the crisis were dismissed: "Not true," Scholtz said, "not yet."

IRD SHORTAGES HIT UK TRADE

DESPITE Pace's efforts to boost output of analogue IRDs, the UK trade
reported serious shortages continuing into the peak pre-Christmas sales
season.

Pace said it had pulled out all the stops to up volume, with output of
analogue IRDs 30 per cent up on the same period last year. As a short-
term measure it resumed production of the old PRD800 receiver, with
scarcity of essential silicon the chief factor limiting MSS range
output.

The knock-on effect has left other manufacturers struggling to keep up
with demand. At least one brand - Maspro - sold out completely, with md
Chris Lack explaining that the last batch of Maspro ST8 MkII IRDs had
gone by mid-November: the stock was supposed to last until March.

Distributor Satellite Solutions' md Grant Lester reported "a
significant shortage... I've got five times more orders than stock.
Everything is pre-sold."  Grundig's Keith Armour confirmed that under-
supply was still a problem in the first weeks of December: "We've met
all our orders, but the problem is that people are looking to us to
fill the gap in the pipeline," he said. "The market's doing better than
any of us expected. Quarter Four '95 is up on '94 and '93 - it's the
best in the last three years."

BT OPENS UK UPLINK FOR PAS-4

BT HAS inaugurated a new uplink site at Martlesham, Suffolk to uplink
services to the PAS-4 satellite. "The PAS-4 look angle is so low so you
have to go east as far as you can," explained head of broadcast
services John Swingewood. "The best site we had was our research centre
at Martlesham Heath, where the original Sky uplink was sited."

BT has installed 16 and 13-metre antennas, one for C-Band and the other
for Ku-Band at a cost of over #3 million. "We don't spend that kind of
money unless we are confident that there is a market," said Swingewood.
The facility will be used for coverage of Asia and India with both
inbound and outbound traffic.

The service will be jointly marketed by BT and PanAmSat, who already
market services together with their third partner, Washington
International Teleport, including a 6MBit space segment on PAS-1.

The most likely first clients for the service are MultiChoice, Viacom
(for MTV and other services) and ART for its proposed services to the
region. BT is already transmitting backhaul services to PAS-4 for the
MultiChoice package in South Africa. Seven originate at Madley, where
they are taken from existing satellites, while the remaining seven are
delivered from the BT Tower in central London.

ORBIT BOOKS INTO EUROPE

ORBIT has booked three transponders on Intelsat 702 to allow small-dish
reception of its digital DTH pay-package across western Europe and
North Africa.

Orbit says the new capacity, which will fire up early in 1996, will
enable viewers from London to Algiers to access its channels via 80cm
dishes, giving the same level of service as provided to Middle Eastern
territories via Intelsat 704.

LEBANESE JOIN ARABSAT 2A

FUTURE Vision - the Lebanese broadcaster owned by billionaire prime
minister Rafiq Hariri - as well as Bahrain TV - have each booked a high-
power Ku-Band transponder on Arabsat 2A, the first of the second-
generation Aerospatiale craft scheduled for launch in July 1996.

In the interim, Future is expected to use a transponder on Arabsat 1DR
- two years after the Lebanese channel first went onto satellite, only
to be removed a few weeks later as a result of licensing problems.

Arabsat 2A, to be located at 26 degrees East, and its follow-up, 2B
(destined for 30.5 degrees East after a May 1997 launch) will each
carry 12 Ku-Band and 22 C-Band transponders. With domestic and regional
demand for the satellites building up, Arabsat is conducting a
feasibility study for a third new satellite.

THOMSON ANTI OPEN ACCESS DVB

THOMSON, first-year sole supplier of digital IRDs to DirecTv, sees a
similar pattern of exclusive deals driving the European market.
Delivering this year's Royal Television Society Shoenberg lecture in
London, Thomson research director David Brooks warned would-be digital
broadcasters that manufacturers would not be willing to bear the risks
of launching open-standard DVB boxes into the marketplace.

Exclusive or limited-supplier deals, such as those made by Canal Plus
in France, would be "the only way to ensure a return on investments,"
he said. With a million DSS sales clocked up, a new order for three
million MMDS digital set-tops from the US Tele-TV consortium, plus a
one-year exclusive window for Galaxy Latin America's digital IRDs,
Thomson has got further than most of its rivals.

Brooks believed that set-top-boxes would dominate the digital TV market
for several years, rather than integrated digital TV sets. "It's clear
the set-top-box offers the fastest way into the market," he said.
"Access control is the key issue here - it would be very difficult to
integrate a proprietary system into the TV set, in commercial terms."

Full integration would come, but only after interface requirements had
been fully standardised, and large (40-inch-plus) plasma display
technology had been brought to the market. He felt the DVB-proposed
"PCMCIA-like" common interface was "not the ideal solution,"
particularly in the "hostile environment" of the TV set. An
alternative, he added, could soon be available in the shape of "more
sophisticated smart cards" which would be able to cope with the full
MPEG-2 bitstream.

Terrestrial barely figures in Brooks' forecasts for European DVB market
growth, with satellite dominating for at least the first three years.
Brooks' forecasts (see table) were based on market projections for
France, Germany, UK, Benelux, Scandinavia and Italy.

PACE SCOOPS CHINA SET-TOP DEAL

PACE Micro Technology has won an order to supply three million  set-top
decoders to cable operators in China. The UK manufacturer will be
supplying the units to Guangdong Catv, a provincial cable operator,
over a three-year period.

Located on the Chinese border with Hong Kong, Guangdong Catv negotiated
the deal also on behalf of four other Chinese networks in the 66
million homes region, taking in the six million homes in the capital,
Guangzhou. The first 60,000 units, incorporating News Datacom's
NewsCrypt conditional access, will be delivered by June 1996.
Subsequent production of the units will be carried out by a
Pace/Guangdong joint venture company in China.

According to Pace estimates, China has almost 40 million cable homes
representing penetration of around 13 per cent of total households. The
systems themselves are small, with around 12,000, mainly low-capacity
networks carrying between eight and 20 channels. These typically
include the local terrestrial and government channels, but sometimes as
many as four channels from Star TV. By 2005 as many as 130 million
homes are expected to be connected. This is against the background of a
nationwide satellite dish ban.

BARCO SELLS ROSA TO GUANGDONG

BELGIAN cable equipment manufacturer Barco has sold its Rosa Catv
Management System and the Pulsar TV modulator to China. The products
are destined for the Guangdong Province Catv system. The Rosa system,
which has also been sold to operators in Taiwan and Australia, is set
to be operational across 40 headends in Guangdong Province by the end
of March 1996.

Rosa allows fully automated monitoring and control of headends through
a PC interface and can be operated from thousands of miles away. The
system continuously checks the performance of the headend and in the
event of a fault can switch to back-up modulators based on pre-set
parameters.

Pulsar is a microprocessor controlled TV modulator featuring its own
remote monitoring capabilities and Barco's unique concept of automatic
alignment to catv headends.

According to division manager, broadcast and cable products, Jos
Vancoppernolle, Asia now represents 20 per cent of Barco's business.
There are regular sales of fibre-optic and headend equipment and,
according to Vancoppernolle, plenty of interest in Rosa.

Many Barco products already have the capability to work with Chinese
graphics, and Mandarin software for Rosa is also being introduced.
Vancoppernolle said the investment for this could be recouped in as
little as six months.

DRAKE LAUNCHES GLOBAL IRDS

R L DRAKE has launched its first IRDs, the ESR800 XT and the ESR2000XT
multi-standard, multi-voltage version. Both are engineered to accept a
range of decoder modules including VideoCrypt and D2 Mac Eurocrypt, and
incorporating a card-reader accessed from the front panel. The
ESR2000XT offers Pal/NTSC compatibility, and has dual smart card
readers.

The receiver section offers variable threshold extension to less than
3dB, programmable for customised settings for different regions of the
world. It also allows programmable audio threshold extension, with
Wegener-compatible noise reduction and companding circuitry adjustable
to market conditions.

The ESR800XT has 800 programmable channel memory, each with individual
video/audio and antenna setting, plus 400 favourite channels. Its big
brother offers a useful 2,000 programmable channels, 400 favourites,
and can  track inclined orbit satellites using an optional IOA600
module.

Both models offer six-language on-screen display option, including
Portuguese and Arabic, which as product manager Dan Albrecht notes,
"greatly increases the usability of our products in many regions of the
world."

ECHOSTAR DIGITAL BOX UNVEILED

WITH the launch of the Echostar 1 satellite from the Chinese Long March
rocket due on December 28, the US company displayed its first digital
satellite receiver at Hong Kong's Cable & Satellite Asia show in
December.

The MPEG-2-compatible receiver includes conditional access provided by
Nagra Plus of Switzerland. Digital encoding is supplied by Divicom.
Programme choice is made through a sophisticated EPG. "We've tried to
make it as simple as possible, some other brands make it quite
difficult to get from their menu back into the programming, you've got
to go through a lot of gyrations. We do it in one button," says
Echostar's Peter Knowles.

The utilities menu includes an aid to align the dish towards the
correct satellite. If the subscriber enters his zip code then the
receiver will automatically display the correct azimuth and elevation
angles for anywhere within the US. There is also a field strength
indicator, changing colour to green when the Echostar satellite is
found. Diagnostic features help installers talk through problems on the
telephone without the need to make house calls. Smart cards and phone
links through the RGA14 point can be checked.

Echostar's DBS system will offer over 100 channels of digital video and
250 channels of audio, transmitting across the US to 18-inch dishes.

S-A EXPANDS 8600 SET-TOP FACILITIES

SCIENTIFIC Atlanta is upping the bandwidth on its 8600 set-top box. A
new 750MHz version will be made available to the Asian market next year
having already been successfully deployed in the US where it is used by
the top 10 MSOs where 700,000 units have so far been shipped, says S-A.

Marketing manager, subscriber products international division broadband
communications, Vibha Rustagi said that operators would typically
purchase both the 550MHz and 750MHz versions. The 750MHz versions would
only then be deployed in homes which had subscribed to premium
channels, saving network operators a possible $15 (#10). Bandwidth of
550MHz can normally carry up to 60 channels.

The 8600 series features an on-screen display capable of individual
messaging either to individuals or to groups of subscribers. Pay-per-
view ordering can be made through impulse on the RF.

A key part of the 8600 is the electronic programme guide. Following the
familiar pattern of EPGs, subscribers can look up shows in the schedule
requesting greater detail on their desired programme choice. Through
'virtual channels' an operator can add additional sections of data,
perhaps with backing from a sponsor, which do not take up the full
amount of bandwidth required by a broadcast network, thus adding to the
customer's perceived value.

A built in set-top diagnostic enables the subscriber to quote a
reference number back to the service engineer, saving a house call if
the problem can be solved from the headend.

SATELLITE READY REVISITED

MITSUBISHI has joined the select band of manufacturers offering Nicam
and Dolby TV sets with on-board satellite receivers - recognising that
in the UK at least, Sky Television remains the chief source of surround
sound transmissions.

The Japanese manufacturer's latest AV18B and AV18BDS series offers 59cm
and 66cm models, in either Nicam or full Dolby Pro Logic versions, each
complete with integrated 150-channel satellite receiver/VideoCrypt
decoder.

The satellite section is pre-tuned to all current Astra (1A to 1D) TV
and radio channels, with dedicated Scart for simultaneous recording.
The sets offer many other advanced features, - including NTSC and Secam
playback capability.

Interestingly the satellite-equipped models retail at just #50 more
than the terrestrial-only versions, with the top model to sell at
#899.99.

HIGH-END CHAPARRAL

US receiver maker Chaparral has never been one to shy away from the
high end of the market. On a visit to its 'Euro-bunker,' Julian Clover
finds out why

Craig Howard is a long way from home. On this occasion, the US receiver
and LNB manufacturer's representative in Europe is in Heerhugowaard, a
suburb of Amsterdam, and nominally Chaparral's European headquarters.

Before arriving in Europe, the company had considered London as a
possible base, but with its Dutch distributor, The Satellite Shop,
already making a major contribution to the business, coupled with
favourable local regulations for the incorporation of foreign
companies, the Dutch capital became the preferred option.

The Satellite Shop is a major element in the Dutch DTH business. From
its base in Heerhugowaard, TSS has developed from being a dealer to
distributor and is now even getting into the manufacturing business.
Its newest product is a low-cost mount, which allows the tracking of
inclined orbit satellites, preferably as an accompaniment to
Chaparral's high-end receivers for the motorised market.

"We knew that we wanted to get a base in Europe, but we just didn't
know where to commit," explains Howard. "The Satellite Shop has always
housed our Info Centre and we've done a lot of testing here in the past
of alpha products. We decided early in 1994 that if we were going to
base somewhere this should be it."

Chaparral's first reconnaissance trip to Europe was nine years ago when
Dave Thomas was despatched from the company's base in San Jose to find
distributors for its product. "They were essentially just dealers,
hobbyists who were fascinated with the technology," says Howard. "Some
of them have developed into people like Rens Maas or Steve Chilver, who
became people who were significant in their respective markets."

Chaparral Europe is, in fact, something of a misnomer; Howard - whose
father Taylor is chairman of the board of the SBCA, America's satellite
trade association - spends at least half of his time outside of the
Netherlands. "There was a really long debate in the company as to
whether I was going to be based in Dubai after Spain, because we had so
much going on there. But, we've spent a long time developing
partnerships in the key Middle East markets, and they're working out
very well. We're comfortable that we've covered there," he says.

In addition to the US and Europe, Chaparral boasts offices in Beijing
and Jakarta. The company also a presence in South America, though not
an office.

Feeds and LNBs remain, according to Howard, Chaparral's lifeblood.
"It's interesting because in the US we're so well known for our feeds
and LNBs and in so many other markets it's receivers - that's what
we're famous for in Europe. We sell a lot more feed and LNB products in
Europe than we do receivers dollarwise, but we hold that high-end niche
which most people have left alone."

In the US, Chaparral has pulled out of the receiver business - the
result of the market's recent shift away from 'backyard' C-Band to
digital DBS. In addition, the cost of Japanese-manufactured equipment
has fallen as the dollar continues to take a pounding from the Yen.
However, receivers for the US business and educational sector, where
Chaparral is the market-leader, remain in production.

"Internationally, our receivers are still quite strong and there are
three models we manufacture for markets specifically other than the
US," says Howard. The Monterey 140 and MC115 are set to be joined by a
new product, the 200C, for educational and overseas distance-learning
markets. The new product has more extensive control via telephone lines
and PC links.

In Europe, the company hasn't been afraid to mix and match its products
to suit its target markets. In the UK, for instance, not only has
Chaparral elected to stay out of the low-end receiver business, but it
has taken a unique approach to the high-end niche. "The UK market
nearly demands that you have VideoCrypt built-in, or the ability to add
it later on. Steve Chilver Trading - our exclusive full-line
distributor in the UK - is a value-added reseller and they make some
specific models for the market, like the rebranded Highway version."

But as always with bespoke tailoring, it doesn't come cheap. The
Monterey 140, which retails for #1,500 without a decoder goes up in
price by another #1,000 by the time either D2 Mac or VideoCrypt
decoders are added.

With digital on the horizon and most new non-Astra channels taking the
MPEG route, won't demand for motorised systems simply dry up? "People
who have exposure to satellite currently have a better taste for it.
People that go digital immediately are not going to know any better,"
replies Howard. Chaparral's receivers too are future-proof, or at least
compatible with digital decoders, unlike those of its competitors.

"Satellite receivers became such a competitive business that most
people looked at the circuitry and said why bother in a market for that
is going to be relatively slim," says Howard. He believes that southern
Africa, among other emerging markets, will eventually see combined
analogue and digital receivers - a product which will prove expensive,
but for which there will probably be great demand.

RAINBOW WARRIORS

South Africa may have the first MPEG-2 DSTV service, but it seems the
Rainbow Nation will demand a wider variety of services. Nick Snow
reports from Satsem '95

If ever a land was made for direct-to-home satellite television
services it was South Africa, where the 'Rainbow Nation' is spread
across distances that defy the European imagination. In 1973 the South
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) said "DBS is the obvious
route... but economic factors are a problem."

The quotation could happily have run 22 years later as the headline for
Satsem '95 in November, the second annual gathering at Johannesburg's
World Trade Centre organised by SCASA (Satellite Communications
Association of South Africa) for the growing DTH industry.

The industry conference allied to a small exhibition brought together
the main players from broadcasters to installers, and brought out the
main issues confronting this potentially huge market.

From a scratch start South Africa recently became the world's first
digital satellite broadcasting nation with full DVB MPEG-2
compatibility following the launch of MultiChoice DSTV off of PAS-4.
MultiChoice is, of course, part of the Nethold sphere of pay-television
companies which, among others, includes South Africa's long-established
terrestrial pay-TV broadcaster M-Net, encryption services provider
Irdeto and signal distribution offshoot Orbicom. It is hard to
overestimate the group's dominance in this its home market, and the
lack of current competition was high on the agenda of this gathering of
independent-minded distributors, dealers and installers.

In theory, there was good news for them. Gert Claassen, CEO of SABC,
arrived to announce it was pressing ahead with plans to launch (at
least) five analogue free-to-air channels on PAS-4 and Intelsat 704,
and by summer 1996 eight digital subscription channels building to 21
channels by July 1998.

Failing to arrive were the team from Africa Satellite Entertainment
Corporation (ASEC), which has transponder rights on Intelsat 704 and
whose test-card was still promising a launch of services in the last
week of November.

Suddenly, South Africa was to be awash with signals both digital and
analogue, although apart from MultiChoice's supermarket shelf of the
leading channel brands from Europe and the US, and SABC's rebroadcast
of national and regional channels, there was little clue what would be
on them. And would it matter anyway? Availability of receivers - in
particular the DSTV receivers of exclusive licensees Pace and Panasonic
- was a dominant theme. At least four of five receivers were at the
show and after some cajoling several of them worked. Estimates of how
many would be available by Christmas '95 ranged from virtually nil to
50,000.

An inauspicious start it might seem - although dire warnings about the
perils of regular complete signal loss for viewers in South Africa's
hostile climate (the idea of a small problem with a digital signal is
apparently in the same category of wishful thinking as being a little
bit pregnant), lead some to imply installers would be better off
starved of supply until they'd had some practice. Needless to say, the
installers didn't see it that way.

MultiChoice, though, remains relaxed. And why not? Its service is very
expensive (possibly over #50 a month for the full package and up to
#500 for the receiver) but it hits breakeven at not much over 200,000
subs or 10 per cent of the target affluent white market. And in a
country where most urban white homes sport notices pronouncing armed
response alarms, it isn't difficult to see them paying up for more in-
home entertainment.

Meantime, there remains a vast if less affluent market to be served and
the ANC government is anxious it should be recognising broadcasting as
a potentially benevolent binding element for the Rainbow Nation.

It seems certain that either through the SABC (whose future is in doubt
but some form of privatisation seems the most likely option), or more
likely a commercial joint venture with MultiChoice, a range of analogue
services can and will co-exist alongside DSTV.

If, however, everyone pursues the digital dream too soon, many felt
South Africa could have the unwelcome distinction of being the first
market outside the US into the digital market and the first to be
forced to abandon it.

QUALITY TIME

Gate numbers weren't, perhaps, all they might have been at Hong Kong's
Cable and Satellite Asia exhibition, allowing vendors to spend a little
'quality time' with their potential customers

Along the growth curve of satellite exhibitions Cable & Satellite Asia
is, like the market it serves, still in its genesis. However, Year Two
of the show, which took place at Hong Kong's Convention and Exhibition
Centre (December 6-8), proved that the Singapore office of Reed
Exhibition Companies is making steady progress in its development. 120
international exhibitors were present, between them boasting as many as
90 new products. Visitor numbers nudging just 2,000 were approximately
a third down on a year ago, which was attributed by some to MipAsia
taking place the week before and not simultaneously, as it did in 1994.

Nevertheless, Cable & Satellite Asia '95 witnessed a 20 per cent growth
in size and the organiser is banking on further 30 per cent growth for
this year's event, which again takes place in Hong Kong November 20-22.
And according to Jimmy Lau, regional vice president, Reed Exhibition
Companies, the amount of floorspace booked for 1997 is double again.

"This year we have seen an even higher number of overseas visitors,
people who actually make plans to come in and visit the show," says
Lau. "From my conversations with the exhibitors, they've maybe come
across only one dissatisfied customer, the rest are making good
contacts."

One problem which seems to afflict Cable and Satellite Asia, as it does
with the sister show in London, is a shortage of cable operators.
Though some were present, particularly at the conference, Lau has some
ideas up his sleeve to boost their attendance in future years.

Yet, there was certainly no lack of exhibitors targeting the cable
sector; among others, the mighty Americans

General Instrument and Scientific Atlanta were present, as were Euro
suppliers Barco and Sagem. The latter proving that there is a market
for D2 Mac, even in Asia.

Barco of Belgium, took the opportunity to launch its Pulsar remote-
monitoring TV modulator into the Asian market. The company, which
counts Hong Kong among almost 30 offices, announced that it had already
sold both Pulsar and Rosa catv management system to the Guangdong
Province Catv System. Guangdong, in fact, was on everybody's lips,
especially because of Pace's announcement that it was supplying the
region with three million cable set-tops. Guangdong, located on China's
border with Hong Kong, also acquired hardware on behalf of other
provinces within the PRC. The first 60,000 Pace units are slated for
delivery in June.

Pace shared its stand with the BBC, apparently to promote a common
terrestrial/satellite digital platform, an ambition which extends
beyond the confines of their domestic, UK markets. Though according to
John Sykes, head of BBC Resource's transmission section, development
plans have stalled slightly of late because of the debate over QAM
variants. With NTL having proposed 2QAM for the UK and most of the rest
of Europe pushing for 8QAM, Pace, he suggested, would probably take the
commercial decision to include both in its box.

Though attendees came from right across the region, including the
Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand, Lau says he wants to build
up the numbers coming from Taiwan and India, which he says are still
strangers to the show. "There are more people coming who are more
interested in hardware than programming, but I think this will increase
as we continue our association with Casbaa," he says.

The involvement of Casbaa (the Cable and Satellite Broadcasting
Association) - itself a growing industry force in the region - produced
a conference line-up which read like a who's who in the industry in the
Asia region. Bill Hooks, (outgoing) president HBO Asia, Gary Davey,
Star TV's managing director and Casbaa and Turner's Far East president,
Ted McFarland, made for a formidable line-up. Lau though suggests that
McFarland's boss, Ted Turner (or is it now Gerry Levine) might even be
tempted to appear at a future conference.

Programmers were few and far between on the exhibit floor, but not
entirely absent. ESPN and CNBC were both present, as was Turner
International. However, Star was there only in the guise of its
hardware arm, Starnet, and satellite operators were also conspicuous by
their absence in the exhibition hall.

The next Cable and Satellite Asia will run parallel to Reed's
Intermedia show, which has been a successful exhibition in its own
right in both the US and Singapore. Lau's aim is for synergies between
multimedia companies and cablecos, already flowering in the US, to also
be cultivated in the Asia Pacific markets.

TRANSPONDER WATCH

45W: PAS-1

PAS-3R is due to fly with an Ariane 4 launch vehicle to 43 degrees
West, joining this satellite which launched in June 1988. The original
PAS-3 met a watery grave a year ago. The new satellite is an HS601
satellite with 16 C-Band and 16 Ku-Band transponders, and will be used
for television programme distribution on both sides of the Atlantic and
in North and South America and Africa. NHK feeds are now at 68.5
degrees East at 12GHz.

37.5W: Orion 1

NTL has a five-year contract with Orion for distribution to cable
headends. London's Channel One will be uplinked from London in digital
MPEG-2, DVB-compliant System 3000 for around 40 cable systems, each
with a top-specification 2.4-metre dish. Most signals on this satellite
are actually acceptable on dishes half that size. The Yugoslavian peace
deals prompted the return of TV from Pale on 12586MHz vertical and a
newcomer is South Korean KDBS, every night at around 19.00-20.00GMT in
Pal on 12654MHz vertical, Tp.3 with a good signal originating in
Germany. Hindi-Urdu channel Asianet is on 11585MHz horizontal from New
Jersey, USA and is probably the best of the bunch, especially as it
remains, for the time being, in-the-clear. Plenty of feeds have been
noted on 11539MHz vertical.

l 27.5W: Intelsat 601

BBC Prime slogs away in D2 Mac on Tp.71 vertical along with fellow UK
Travel channel in Tp. 63B, while on the opposite polarity CMT Europe
feeds into Europe from the US 24- hours-a-day, but at a signal strength
that makes smaller dish reception difficult. SIS has long used a
transponder on this satellite to feed UK betting shops and is on
11591MHz horizontal, hence the 1.2-metre fixed polarity and position
dishes close to many UK betting establishments. The other B Mac signal,
a system that remains unhacked, is UK cable channel SelecTV, sharing
the lower part of Travel's transponder. FilmNet has a digital multiplex
on this satellite and some UK cable-only channels use the MPEG-2
compression system here too.

29.4W: Intelsat 504

Intelsat 504 was removed from geostationary orbit in mid-November. It
was launched in 1982 serving the Atlantic Ocean Region. The oldest
Intelsat - 501 - is still in service.

21.5W: Intelsat K & 512

US wrestling for Sky One continues to be fed over this craft at
11532MHz vertical in NTSC. Feeds for the Mir-Atlantis space expedition
were seen on 11499MHz horizontal and 11533MHz vertical. New Intelsats
due above the Euro horizon this year are 708, at 50 degrees West, 709,
at 56 degrees West and 803 at 64 degrees East. It is at the end of this
year that two degrees spacing around 60-66 degrees East is implemented.

19W: TDF1/2

There are three active transponders. Canal Plus on Tp.5 1804MHz, Cine
Cinemas on Tp.9 11881MHz and Canal France International on 12034MHz,
all in D2 Mac. Generally, the situation now is that there are only
seven high-power DBS satellites active in European skies which carry
less than 10 unencrypted TV channels. Apart from second-hand value for
broadcasts to Scandinavia, the European DBS satellites each with five
high-power 100 watt transponders have proved to be the wrong platform
for the wrong job.

14W: Ekspress 2

The Ekspress satellite has four more transponders than the preceding
Gorizont class; 10 C-Band and two Ku-Band transponders are available.
An adaptable mixture of cross-strapping and six antennas allows more
flexibility than before. This satellite has maintained station-keeping
better than any other Russian satellite to date, apart from the Gals
DBS craft. TV use is confined to C-Band and amounts to six channels;
Apna, Muslim, RTPi, Cuba, TV3 Russia and ORT Russia, sharing four
transponders.

5W: Telecom 2A

Tucked away on teletext was a short but notable announcement that TF1
and France Television (operators of France 2 and 3) are to join forces
to investigate digital pay-TV services via Eutelsat. France Telecom
would appear to have under-estimated the in-orbit capacity required for
TV services.

3E: Telecom 1C

After Flight 80's success at delivering a space-telescope, Ariane
Flight 81 returned to the serious business of satellite TV and took
Telecom 2C and Insat 2C into orbit. Bayern 3 broadcast the launch live
on Astra, as it has most recent Ariane launches. Insat 2C is the first
of the Insat 2 series to be for telecommunications-only; there is no
meteorology equipment on-board. In place of that payload there are two
Ku-Band transponders. Insat 2C will be located at 93.5 degrees East.
The French satellite will replace Telecom 1C this month and bring much-
needed second-generation Ku-capacity to the French Telecom portfolio.
The new satellite has C-Band and 12GHz capacity in horizontal as well
as the Telecom 1 series vertical polarisation. Feeds of the US
President's visit to Ireland for BBC News were noted on 12648MHz
vertical. Also, inserts for the terrestrial channel TV de Catalunya
appeared. Play from the ATP-Championship-tour in Germany destined for
Sky was seen in-the-clear on 12606MHz vertical.

5E Tele-X & Sirius

Swedish channel SVT 2 has switched to digital format on 12422MHz.

13E: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1

La Cinquieme has joined Arte on Tp.26 11080MHz vertical. It shows an
educational mix of programmes each daytime. RTL-2 has been joined by a
Jazz sound sub-carrier of unknown origin on 8.10MHz, 11096MHz
horizontal, but probably a filler from RFE. Italian TV channels Rai Uno
and Rai Due moved here from 10 degrees East last year. The last
international TV service from Italy was Raisat on the Olympus satellite
at 19 degrees West, which died in August 1993. Rai is to join the
international TV league this year when a satellite-delivered service to
the Americas and Australia is anticipated. VOA Europe, a music and
speech mix reflecting the American way of life, has been taken by cable
and a few terrestrial stations over the years. At present it uses
Deutsche Welle TV sub-carriers but US government cuts are forcing the
station to find private financing. However it has been granted a
reprieve until March, when it might have to leave the air. In Europe,
CNN and NBC do such do good job in the private sector, that VOA and
radio's days must be numbered. Latest VOA convert is Melody 91.5 FM
heard on a recent visit to Beirut. The 36MHz, six-channel Viacom
digital multiplex signal on this satellite includes an MTV feed, MTV
Italian and German streams, Sci-Fi Channel and Bloomberg TV, a version
of the already successful US financial service on PAS-2. The analogue
VH-1 Germany signal on 11238MHz horizontal has ceased and dual-
illuminates the digital multiplex. Tp.40 12521MHz on this satellite has
been taken by AB-1 Channel, a French family entertainment network in
analogue Pal, for cable networks. Tp.41 is used by both WTN and APTV
for digital feeds from the Gray's Inn Road Teleport in London. XXX-TV,
or TV Erotica, on 11534MHz in D2 Mac, has been deemed too hot for
Britain, if not for Hot Bird 1, and has been given the same treatment
meted out to Red Hot Television. The UK Heritage minister has issued an
order outlawing the supply of smart cards, programmes and advertising
related to the channel. At least two more adult channels are due on-air
this year, Babylon Blue and Adam and Eve, the latter with no link to
the US channel of the same name. The Rabin funeral last year was the
cause of largest bookings of space segment yet, according to Maxat.
Also using the resources of adaptable Maxat; Herbalife TV has been seen
on this satellite at 12586MHz vertical. Longer term, Eutelsat has
agreed the launch next year, of three satellites with Arianespace. They
are Hot Bird 4 and two other (W24) satellites at other locations.

16E: Eutelsat II F3

The most obvious change on this satellite is the colourful Thaiwave,
from Thailand each evening around 18.00-20.00GMT. In a welcome addition
to satellite TV, the tests are seen every evening on Tp.22, 11163MHz
horizontal with audio at 6.6MHz. Scrambling of the signal will follow
and the fee will be DM56 each month. Egyptian TV is to add another
relay of its international service this year. Besides the relay on this
satellite, Arabsat C-Band at 31 degrees East and 1 degree West
Intelsat, a new relay to the Americas starts in May via the Alphastar
DBS satellite, or AT&T's Telstar 402R as it correctly known. It is
owned by Canadian-based Tee-Comm, and a medium-power, 100-channel
service to the US will start early this year to 60cm dishes from 89
degrees West. ATN, Asian Television Network will also join them.
Radiotelevisao Portuguesa Internaaional, which reaches most corners of
this small globe, has never been easy to find programme details for. An
Internet web though has just opened to provide those missing facts. The
channel will probably be available live via the same route within a
couple of years. TV Roumania International and for a while Actualitati
Radio, the channels that sadly could not bring you President
Ceausescu's Christmas message in 1989, seem to be fully operational
from the new Bucharest Scientific Atlanta uplink to Tp.37, 11575MHz
vertical 19.30-23.00GMT daily. An indication of the true pace of change
there is the recent ban on the cable TV relay of Duna TV from Hungary
in nearby Timisoara. TVRi was formed as many eastern European nations
have been starting satellite TV services for expatriates or foreign
audiences. The abandoned Polsat slot at 11638MHz horizontal was
occupied by Apna TV, the Hindi channel also at 11 degrees West Ku-Band,
but has now ceased.

19.2E: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1E

The end of next month sees CNBC launch more fully on Astra with Asian,
live US and four hours of The European Money Wheel programme. Astra 1E
is invisible to most fixed-dish owners due the frequency band used. The
satellite tested at around 14.7 degrees East and had been moved into
position by the first week of December, after blank carrier tests but
no analogue pictures were seen. As production rates and costs will be a
factor in the take-up of DVB digital TV, the news of a new single chip
receiver, the LS64704, from LSI Logic Corp, is a welcome development.
Early users will be ZDF and ARD, which start parallel transmissions of
their analogue Pal signals soon. America One is the new audio service
on VH-1 Tp.22 at 11538MHz, 7.74MHz. Live speech programming is provided
by National Public radio in Washington and Public Radio International
of Minneapolis. The service was due to start January 1 and is provided
by successful radio-relay agent WRN, World Radio Network, which now
runs four different programmes on various satellites. The operating
frequencies at this location are now 10700-12100MHz. There are various
ways of achieving such reception, but the new Universal LNBs are
probably the most cost-efficient and flexible units yet produced for
the European market. The lack of digital signals and suitable receivers
effectively rules out the need for DBS band reception, at least at
presently. No serious BSkyB digital involvement is expected until 1997.
As we enter this New Year, the channels now at this location look quite
varied. There are two clear news channels, Sky News and CNN, as well as
portions of NBC/CNBC. There are also two clear sports channels, multi-
lingual Eurosport and German DSF. TNT is the only clear English/French
film channel, sharing time with Cartoon Network. Arte is a clear
cultural German/French channel with some original-language programming.
It is a rather long list, but in addition to the above there are the
clear German broadcasters, both public and private, four channels for
the Dutch market and some offerings from further afield; Japan's NHK
through JSTV, Mexico's Galavision, Hindi Zee TV and two Chinese
channels. Three versions of TV3 for Denmark, Norway and Sweden,
accounting for three transponders, looks wasteful though, while Spanish
thematic channels absorb another three. QVC's home shopping service is
the only free access VideoCrypt signal in Europe, and the remaining
signals on the satellites are either German or UK-based scrambled
channels, mainly with Videocrypt scrambling, though some run dual VC2
codes. Also, 58 different radio programmes in an assortment of
languages are transmitted on FM audio sub-carriers.

20E: Telstar 301/

Arabsat 1DR

If it was not for the cooling effect of winter temperatures on our LNB
unit, we would have lost the signals from the Orbit barker channel plus
Syrian, Sudanese and the four ART channels on this satellite. All
signals are in the 3740-4060MHz range, are horizontal and, thus, limp
into Europe.

28.5E: DFS Kopernikus 2 Flight 2

VT4 for the Flemish audience uses digital capacity played out from the
Maxat teleport at Brookmans Park, using the Tandberg, Sagem and Divicom
system on 12544MHz vertical. Other occupants are the Hungarian
scrambled music channel Top-TV and Czech channels Premiera and Cable
Plus. The satellite is also used for video feeds within Germany and
beyond.

42E: Turksat 1B

Look out for Bosnian TV from Sarajevo - the logo is BIH. The signal may
appear here or on a Eutelsat, although reports of it being ready for
the New Year proved over-optimistic. Kanal 6 and Interstar both
suffered programme suspension at the end of last year, puzzling many
viewers. The Turkish state regulator had upheld complaints against the
channels over political, sexual and economic allegations made on news
and current affairs programmes.

68.5E: PAS-4

Doordarshan TV International (DDI) is on this satellite on C-Band at
Tp.12C 4040MHz horizontal with programming from 03.30 to 0630GMT in
Hindi and English. It brought news of the official opening of DD3, a
new domestic Indian TV broadcaster. All other TV direct from Indian is
on satellites beyond the Euro-arc, including NEPC (the exception,
spotted this month on 66 degrees East), another new Indian channel
which has taken to air with Hindi family programmes. BT at Martlesham
in Suffolk has installed a new dish to access this satellite and is
already supplying programmes into the South African market. The look-
angle to this satellite is low, hence the easterly location.

71E: Gals 1

Gals 2 was launched by a Proton-K rocket on November 17 and has the
same three wide Ku-Band transponders as Gals-1. The orbital destination
is still far from clear but it was at 87.5 degrees East when last
spotted and  drifting at a daily rate of one degree West. A clutch of
reports have the satellite variously leased to Chinese Land Group.
Shareholders include the Loral Corp, General Instrument  and TCI Cable
TV Co, British General Telecommunications Ltd and Asian TV network, a
South African concern and Russian State broadcasting. They all talk
about a co-location here or further over at 31 degrees East. The Gals-1
craft spent some time at 44 degrees East with Russian TV relays in the
12GHz band. The South African IBA has even approved initial consent for
a space TV service from Gals, but a location at the hot South African
51dBW slot at 66 degrees East and PAS-4 at 68.5 degrees East would seem
more logical.

80E: Gorizont 24

Be thankful this satellite is a difficult one to catch; the former
Kazakh TV occupant has been criticised for televising executions. More
acceptable behaviour is seen on HTB (NTV), as seen at 11575MHz vertical
on 16 degrees, East and also from TV6 Moscow.

100.5E: Asiasat 2

A Long March 2F rocket took Asiasat 2 aloft from Xichang in Sichuan at
the end of last year. The Lockheed Martin series 7000 satellite is
equipped with 24 C-Band and nine Ku-Band transponders. Known bookings
are for Deutsche Welle, RTP Portugal, APTV and Star TV, as well as
China, Vsat systems and other telecommunications projects. Star TV
plans expansion, despite continuing financial losses ascribe by
management to it still being in "investment mode." Those plans include
better targeting of specific countries instead of pan-Asian services.
China Central TV has started to test digital TV services; a film
channel, sports, entertainment and a clear youth/science/military or
'variety channel,' will use capacity here or on Chinasat 5 at 115.5
degrees East. It is notable that the Chinese Public TV station did not
show the Asiasat 2 launch live, in case of public humiliation in a
repeat of the disaster a year ago. Echostar 1, a US DBS satellite bound
for 101 degrees West, is the next Chinese launch and aims to rival the
already established DirecTv.

116 E: Mugunghwa 2

The launch of Koreasat 2, also known as Mugunghwa 2, should have taken
place around New Year. To attend to the problems which shortened the
life of the first satellite, McDonnell-Douglas worked on the Delta 2
rocket's pressure and temperature systems and then successfully used
the same type of vehicle to launch a Canadian Radarsat from California
in November. This year will see the success or failure of the new
Ariane 5, the Russian Proton and the Chinese Long March launchers.
