VIETNAM PLANS TO DEVELOP DEEP-SEA FISHING FLEET: OPP'TIES

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.  VIETNAM'S INTEREST IN DEVELOPING A DEEP SEA FLEET CAPABILITY
BETWEEN NOW AND THE YEAR 200 IS TRONG.  INDEED, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS MADE DEEP SEA FISHING AND AQUACULTURE AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PRIORITY.  CURRENT ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT THE VIETNAMESE FISHING
INDUSTRY WILL NEED TO INVEST $600 MILLION USD OVER TH NEXT FIVE
YEARS IN ORDER TO RAISE OVERALL PRODUCTION FOR CONSUMPTION
INTERNALLY AND FOR EXPORT (OF HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS) FROM 800,000
TONS PER YEAR TO 1,200,000/1,500,000-THE TARGET OBJECTIVE.

2.  VIETNAM PRESENTLY HAS NO DEEP SEA FLEET CAPABILITY.  ITS
FLEET IS LIMITED TO SMALL COASTAL VESSELS OF 400-600 HP WORKING
AT A DEPTH OF 30 TO 50 METERS.  HOWEVER, TO INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY ANNUAL PRODCUTION OF SHRIMP AND YELLOW FIN TUNA,
VIETNMA MUST DEVELOP THE CAPABILITY TO FISH FOR LARGER SIZE
SHRIMP FOUND AT A DEPTH OF 120 TO 150 METERS AND A RANGE OF
150-200 KM FROM SHORE.  THE PRODUCTION BY VIETNAM OF FRESH SHRIMP
AND TUNA ARE BELIEVED TO BE MOST LUCRATIVE FOR SERVICING WORLD
MARKETS.  CURRENTLY, FOREIGN COMPANIES PRIMARILY FROM TAIWAN AND
JAPAN ARE CONTROLLING THIS CATCH.

3.  ACCORDING TO CURRENT ESTIMATES, VIETNAMESE INDUSTRY MUST
DEVELOP A FLEET OF 50 TUNA VESSELS, WITH A "MOTHER" PRCOESSING
SHIP TO PRESERVE THE CATCH AND ENSURE THE HIGHEST QUALITY. FOR
SHRIMPING, THE FLEET IS FOR 250 VESSELS.  A DETAILED GOVERNMENT
SURVEY OF VESSEL NEEDS BY PROVINCE, NOW UNDERWAY, SHOULD BE
COMPLETED BY THE 4TH QUARTER OF 1996.  THE BOATS REQUIRED ARE
EXPECTED TO RANGE IN SIZE FROM 75 TO 110 FEET, WITH 600 HP TO
1,000 HP ENGINES.  EQUIPMENT FOR SHRIPING WILL INCLUDE CAGES FOR
MATURE CRAWFISH, PLUS CONVENTIONAL NETTING GEAR.

4.  THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF VIETNAM FOR A PHASED
APPROACH ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS:  1) THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
APPROVED A $57 MILLION SOFT LOAN PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH THE
LAND-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT DEEP SEA FISHING AND
PURCAHSE ONE 30-50 FEET ALUMINUM HULL FISHING VESSELS, WITH 250
HP (IMPORTED) ENGINES; 2) PURCAHSE OUTRIGHTA NUMBER OF LARGER
SIZE VESSELS FROM ABROAD; 3) ENTER JOINT VENTURES IMPLEMENTED
WITH FOREIGN FIRMS TO CONSTRUCT FISHING VESSELS, USING VIETNAMSE
STAFF IN FOREIGN SHIP YARDS, FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY OF VESSELS IN
VIETNAM AND THEN ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT, NATIONAL
SHIPBUILDING CAPABILITY.

5.  COMPETITIVE FINANCING WILL BE KEY IN ORDER TO WIN ORDERS TO
SUPPLY THESE FISHING VESSELS TOVIETNAM, AUTHORITIES EMPHASIZE.
AND, VIETNAM'S EXPORTERS WILL NEED TO HAVE ASSURED COMMERCIAL
ACCESS TO FOREIGN MARKETS FOR ITS TUNA AND SHRIMP TO BE ABLE TO
SERVICE PAYMENT OF LOAN OBLIGATIONS INCURRED.

6.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:  DR. HO VAN HOANH,
DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION DEPARTMENT, MINISTRY OF
FISHERIES, 57 NGOC KHANH, BA DINH, HANOI, TEL: 84-4-8326396; FAX:
84-4-8326702.
