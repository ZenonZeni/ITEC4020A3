(1) EVENING UPDATE - SURFING THE NET FROM THE COURTROOM

The Court has recessed for the day after a long day of education on the
nature of the Internet, the effectiveness of parental control software, and
testimony on the potential impact of the Communications Decency Act on
small, independent content providers.  Testimony resumes at 9:30 am ET
Friday March 22.

After hearing about the workings of the Internet from Scott Bradner of the
IETF this morning (see CIEC Afternoon Edition 3/21), the Court was given a
visual demonstration of the World Wide Web by SurfWatch's Ann Duvall. After
briefly describing the Internet and the basic steps one must take to get
online (including purchasing a computer and modem, and subscribing to an
Internet Service Provider or Online Service), Duvall logged on and took the
Court on a trip around the Net. Duvall visited a site sponsored by the City
of Philadelphia (the setting of the trial) and checked the schedule for
upcoming Phillies games, then jumped to London for a quick tour of a Museum
before returning to the United States for a demonstration of Yahoo's new
site for Kids (yahooligans). She also showed the court how her daughter had
found information on Fragile X syndrome for a research paper.

Duvall then illustrated the effectiveness of SurfWatch, and parental
control technology generally, by attempting to access several adult
oriented sites (including Penthouse Magazine) with SurfWatch engaged.  She
also illustrated how SurfWatch blocks attempts to search for terms like
"sexy" and "erotica" using common search engines. Each attempt was greated
with a "blocked by SurfWatch" message.

Despite expectations that the Justice Department might attempt to use the
Internet demonstration to show that some sexually explicit Internet sites
may not be blocked by SurfWatch, the DOJ attorneys did not do so, and
offered no examples of sexually explicit sites to the Court. Instead, they
concentrated their efforts on the number of sites SurfWatch blocks
(approximately 5000, plus key words like "sex") in an apparent attempt to
show that there is are a large number of such sites on the Net. They also
suggested SurfWatch may not be effective because sites on the Internet
change frequently and new sites regularly come on line.

The Judges appeared extremely interested in Duvall's testimony, and asked a
number of questions.  They seemed particularly taken with the demonstration
of the World Wide Web and the variety of information available. In an
important question wich may help to illustrate the potential weeknesses of
the CDA, Judge Dalzel focused on Duvall's statement that approximately 30%
of the sites SurfWatch blocks are outside the United States.

SMALL, INDEPENDENT CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL SUFFER UNDER THE CDA

The Court next heard from Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Director of the Critical Path
AIDS Project. Kuroimya, called by the ACLU attorneys, testified that he
maintains a World Wide Web site which contains information on how to avoid
the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Kuromiya stated
that some of the materials on his site use explicit terms which may
violated the "indecency" and "patently offensive" provisions of the CDA.
In response to a question from Judge Dalzel, Kuromiya stated that he would
not want to alter the materials he posts, or deny access to the site, in
order to avoid prosecution under the CDA.

The Court also heard form Patricia Warren  an author and publisher who
maintains a Web site containing excerpts from her books, some of which deal
with Gay and Lesbian subject matter.  Warren stated that she fears
prosecution under the CDA because some in the United States consider the
subject matter she addresses to be 'indecent'.  During her testimony, one
of the Judges, apparently understanding the vast potential of the Internet
to make every user a publisher, asked if it is easier to publish a magazine
online than in printed form. Warren responded by suggesting that because
distribution and production costs are significantly lower on the Net,
publishing online is an important outlet for small publishers with limited
resources.

Neither Kuromiya or Warren were cross examined by the Justice Department.

Testimony resumes tomorrow with Scott Bradner, who had to leave early
today. Witnesses expected to testify also include Donna Hoffman, of
Vanderbeldt University.  Situation permitting, we will post a summary of
tomorrow's testimony starting in the afternoon. Please continue to check
