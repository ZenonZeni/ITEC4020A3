</H2><P>                 


<H3>Is CSP more expensive than other programs?
</H3><P>No, not if you compare apples with apples. Here is why. Our program
is comprehensive. Please note all the services we offer and compare us with
other agencies. We have a full support staff of eight, including medical
coordinator, surrogate coordinator, and trust administrator, among others.
In addition, our team consists of a psychological group of four experienced
counselors, and an experienced law firm we are associated with. We are affiliated
with the finest medical groups currently practicing in the field of infertility.
<P>We also state all costs. Our estimate anticipates all of your expenses,
instead of giving you an initial low fee which excludes many expenses you
will later be asked to pay. If other agencies gave you the same service we
do, their costs would probably be greater than ours. Our fee is $15,800.00.
The remainder of the costs are medical, psychological, legal and surrogate
fees. Please note most of these costs are incurred no matter what program
you select.
<P>We offer over sixteen years of experience in this field with a sterling record of success. The Center offers the most comprehensive program available. We
are proud to provide you with the experience and track record that is simply
not available with other agencies or programs. Ask questions. Compare the
programs! The more information you have, the better informed you will be
to make the appropriate choice for you.
<P>
<H3>Do you have a waiting list to be matched with a Surrogate?
</H3><P>Yes, and that is the good news!
<P>Only a small percentage (about 5%) of potential surrogate mother applicants
are accepted into our program. It takes approximately four months to fully
screen a surrogate candidate before she is able to be matched with a couple.
We are very particular in our selection process. When you are matched with
a surrogate, she will have already been thoroughly screened. You meet your
surrogate only after she has undergone medical evaluations, psychological
screening and testing, criminal background check, insurance evaluation, etc.
<P>Our philosophy is simple. You have waited a long time to come to this
point. A wait of several months for the best surrogate working with the best
program seems reasonable to us and our more than four hundred clients during
the past sixteen years.
<P>
<H3>Do we need to come in for a full consultation?
</H3><P>Yes. We believe this decision is so important, you must have full
informed consent and knowledge of our program before joining us. The only
way we know how to accomplish this is for you to spend four to six hours
at our Center, meeting with our entire staff, a member of the psychological
team and an attorney experienced in the field of surrogacy. There is a lot
of information given at this meeting, and at its end, you will have a very
comprehensive view of all aspects of surrogacy; psychological, legal,
administrative and procedural.
<P>In this complex and emotional partnership, it is also important that prior
to our working together over the next eighteen months to two years, we get
to know you and you get to know all of us. A little familiarity breeds a
lot of comfort when it comes to surrogacy. If you think there's any obligation
in coming to our consultation, let us reassure you we never allow couples
to join our program at the consultation. Even our overseas couples must go
home and digest all of this information prior to making any decision.
<P>
<H3>Do you have a waiting list for Egg Donation?
</H3><P>No. Our Egg Donor program has a surplus of Egg Donors for several
reasons. First, many of our Egg Donors are former surrogates who want to
continue to help couples, yet do not wish to enter into another surrogacy
arrangement (remember, that's a two year commitment!). So, we have a number
of screened, terrific women who are Egg Donor candidates.
<P>Also, the number of women who wish to be Egg Donors is vastly greater
than the number of women applying to be surrogates. So we find ourselves
with an abundance of Egg Donors as opposed to the usual, chronic "shortage"
of surrogate mothers.
<P>
Finally, our Egg Donor program is fairly small and is used primarily as an adjunct to physician's Egg Donor programs (Egg donor programs at a Doctor's office is usually run like a sperm donor program with "closed", anonymous matches). Our Egg Donor program is "open", much like our surrogacy program.   Open referrs to a range of contact possibilities:  you can meet one another face to face;  you can talk on the phone; you can write a note to your egg donor thanking her for her assistance;  you can send her flowers after the transfer as a thank you;  you release only your first names, etc.  In our program we have found that many parties have elected to meet one another with the counselor present.  This enables our Intended Parents to ask questions and get a better understanding of who their donor is.   The totally anonymous situation is rare in our organization.
<P>We are experts at matching specific Egg Donors for specific couples. Our
clients find that our experience in screening and matching women to help
infertile couples is simply unparalleled by any group, much less a medical
group where the emphasis is on the medical procedures not the matching process.
<P>
<H3>Do we get more personal service with a "small" program than with the
Center for Surrogate Parenting?
</H3>
<P>
No, you don't!  Our staff is very available.  After office hours, there are emergency numbers to call anytime to reach one of our staff members or one of the psychological team members assigned personally to you.  We have a staff of eight trained members, as well as being associated with five counselors and an attorney's office, we are able to share the responsibilities and utelize the strengths each staff member or associate has.  With tasks being shared between everyone, we all have time to deal with each issue and pay attention to each and every client.
<P>
Our organization is staffed with real professionals working together to help our couples create their families.  We are a multidisciplinary team of counselors, lawyers, physicians and administrators, and after sixteen years, we know what our clients need; communication, dedication and real commitment to our couples and surrogates.
<P>
To quote one of our couples from a March 9, 1995, letter to our Center:
<P>
<b>"Your staff was wonderful.  Whenever we called (and we did frequently) the response was immediate.  Words can never express our appreciation to you and your staff.  Please know we will be thankful that your center exists and if ever you need someone for references we are available."</b>
