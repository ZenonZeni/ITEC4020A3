<U><B>IPCC Working Group I 1995 Summary for Policymakers</B></U>

<P>
Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of climate
change science since 1990 and new data and analyses have become
available.
<P>
<B>Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase</B>

<P>
Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since pre-industrial
times (i.e. since about 1750) have led to a positive <I>radiative
forcing of climate, tending to warm the surface and to produce
other changes of climate.</I> 
<P>
<I>&#176; The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,
inter alia</I> carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N2O) have grown significantly: by about 30%, 145%, and
15%, respectively (values for 1992). These trends can be attributed
largely to human activities, mostly fossil fuel use, land-use
change and agriculture.
<P>
&#176; The growth rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations were
low during the early 1990s. While this apparently natural variation
is not yet fully explained, recent data indicate that the growth
rates are currently comparable to those averaged over the 1980s.
<P>
&#176; The direct radiative forcing of the long-lived greenhouse
gases (2.45 Wm-2) is due primarily to increases in the concentrations
of CO2 (1.56 Wm-2), CH4 (0.47 Wm-2) and N2O (0.14 Wm-2) (values
for 1992).
<P>
&#176; Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long
time (for CO2 and N2O, many decades to centuries), hence they
affect radiative forcing on long time-scales.
<P>
&#176; The direct radiative forcing due to the CFCs and HCFCs
combined is 0.25 Wm-2. However, their <I>net </I>radiative forcing
is reduced by about 0.1 Wm-2 because they have caused stratospheric
ozone depletion which gives rise to a negative radiative forcing.
<P>
&#176; Growth in the concentration of CFCs, but not HCFCs, has
slowed to about zero. The concentrations of both CFCs and HCFCs,
and their consequent ozone depletion, are expected to decrease
substantially by 2050 through implementation of the Montreal Protocol
and its Adjustments and Amendments.
<P>
&#176; At present some long-lived greenhouse gases (particularly
HFCs (a CFC substitute), PFCs and SF6) contribute little to radiative
forcing but their projected growth could contribute several per
cent to radiative forcing during the 21st century.
<P>
&#176;If carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near current
(1994) levels, they would lead to a nearly constant rate of increase
in atmospheric concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching
about 500 ppmv (approaching twice the pre-industrial concentration
of 280 ppmv) by the end of the 21st century.
<P>
&#176; A range of carbon cycle models indicates that stabilisation
of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv could
be achieved only if global anthropogenic CO2 emissions drop to
1990 levels by, respectively, approximately 40, 110 or 240 years
from now, and drop substantially below 1990 levels subsequently.
<P>
&#176; Any eventual stabilised concentration is governed more
by the accumulated anthropogenic CO2 emissions from now until
the time of stabilisation, than by the way those emissions change
over the period. This means that, for a given stabilised concentration
value, higher emissions in early decades require lower emissions
later on. Among the range of stabilisation cases studied, for
stabilisation at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv accumulated anthropogenic
emissions over the period 1991 to 2100 are 630 GtC, 1030 GtC,
and 1410 GtC respectively (&#177; approximately 15% in each case).
For comparison the corresponding accumulated emissions for IPCC
IS92 emission scenarios range from 770 to 2190 GtC.
<P>
&#176; Stabilisation of CH4 and N2O concentrations at today's
levels would involve reductions in anthropogenic emissions of
8% and more than 50% respectively.
<P>
&#176; There is evidence that tropospheric ozone concentrations
in the Northern Hemisphere have increased since pre-industrial
times because of human activity and that this has resulted in
a positive radiative forcing. This forcing is not yet well characterised,
but it is estimated to be about 0.4 Wm-2 (15% of that from the
long-lived greenhouse gases). However the observations of the
most recent decade show that the upward trend has slowed significantly
or stopped.
<P>
<B>Anthropogenic aerosols tend to produce negative radiative forcings</B>

<P>
&#176; Tropospheric aerosols (microscopic airborne particles)
resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning and
other sources have led to a negative direct forcing of about 0.5
Wm-2, as a global average, and possibly also to a negative indirect
forcing of a similar magnitude. While the negative forcing is
focused in particular regions and subcontinental areas, it can
have continental to hemispheric scale effects on climate patterns.
<P>
&#176; Locally, the aerosol forcing can be large enough to more
than offset the positive forcing due to greenhouse gases.
<P>
&#176; In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse gases, anthropogenic
aerosols are very short-lived in the atmosphere, hence their radiative
forcing adjusts rapidly to increases or decreases in emissions.
<P>
<B>Climate has changed over the past century</B> 
<P>
At any one location year-to-year variations in weather can be
large, but analyses of meteorological and other data over large
areas and over periods of decades or more have provided evidence
for some important systematic changes.
<P>
&#176; Global mean surface air temperature has increased by between
about 0.3 and 0.6lC since the late 19th century ; the additional
data available since 1990 and the re-analyses since then have
not significantly changed this range of estimated increase.
<P>
&#176; Recent years have been among the warmest since 1860, i.e.,
in the period of instrumental record, despite the cooling effect
of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption.
<P>
&#176; Night-time temperatures over land have generally increased
more than daytime temperatures.
<P>
&#176; Regional changes are also evident. For example, the recent
warming has been greatest over the mid-latitude continents in
winter and spring, with a few areas of cooling, such as the North
Atlantic ocean. Precipitation has increased over land in high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, especially during the cold
season.
<P>
&#176; Global sea level has risen by between 10 and 25 cm over
the past 100 years and much of the rise may be related to the
increase in global mean temperature.
<P>
&#176; There are inadequate data to determine whether consistent
global changes in climate variability or weather extremes have
occurred over the 20th Century. On regional scales there is clear
evidence of changes in some extremes and climate variability indicators
(e.g., fewer frosts in several widespread areas; an increase in
the proportion of rainfall from extreme events over the contiguous
states of the USA). Some of these changes have been toward greater
variability; some have been toward lower variability.
<P>
&#176; The 1990 to mid-1995 persistent warm-phase of the El Ni&ntilde;o
-Southern Oscillation (which causes droughts and floods in many
areas) was unusual in the context of the last 120 years.
<P>
<B>The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence
on global climate</B> 
<P>
Any human-induced effect on climate will be superimposed on the
background &quot;noise&quot; of natural climate variability, which
results both from internal fluctuations and from external causes
such as solar variability or volcanic eruptions. Detection and
attribution studies attempt to distinguish between anthropogenic
and natural influences. &quot;Detection of change&quot; is the
process of demonstrating that an observed change in climate is
highly unusual in a statistical sense, but does not provide a
reason for the change. &quot;Attribution&quot; is the process
of establishing cause and effect relations, including the testing
of competing hypotheses.
<P>
Since the 1990 IPCC Report, considerable progress has been made
in attempts to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic influences
on climate. This progress has been achieved by including effects
of sulphate aerosols in addition to greenhouse gases, thus leading
to more realistic estimates of human-induced radiative forcing.
These have then been used in climate models to provide more complete
simulations of the human-induced climate-change 'signal'. In addition,
new simulations with coupled atmosphere-ocean models have provided
important information about decade to century time-scale natural
internal climate variability. A further major area of progress
is the shift of focus from studies of global-mean changes to comparisons
of modelled and observed spatial and temporal patterns of climate
change.
<P>
The most important results related to the issues of detection
and attribution are:
<P>
&#176; The limited available evidence from proxy climate indicators
suggests that the 20th century global mean temperature is at least
as warm as any other century since at least 1400 AD. Data prior
to 1400 are too sparse to allow the reliable estimation of global
mean temperature.
<P>
&#176; Assessments of the statistical significance of the observed
global mean surface air temperature trend over the last century
have used a variety of new estimates of natural internal and externally-forced
variability. These are derived from instrumental data, palaeodata,
simple and complex climate models, and statistical models fitted
to observations. Most of these studies have detected a significant
change and show that the observed warming trend is unlikely to
be entirely natural in origin.
<P>
&#176; More convincing recent evidence for the attribution of
a human effect on climate is emerging from pattern-based studies,
in which the modelled climate response to combined forcing by
greenhouse gases and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols is compared
with observed geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of
atmospheric temperature change. These studies show that such pattern
correspondences increase with time, as one would expect as an
anthropogenic signal increases in strength. Furthermore, the probability
is very low that these correspondences could occur by chance as
a result of natural internal variability only. The vertical patterns
of change are also inconsistent with those expected for solar
and volcanic forcing.
<P>
&#176; Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate
is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging
from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties
in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long
term natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing
by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases
and aerosols, and land surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance
of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence
on global climate.
<P>
<B>Climate is expected to continue to change in the future</B>

<P>
The IPCC has developed a range of scenarios, IS92a-f, of future
greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions based on assumptions
concerning population and economic growth, land-use, technological
changes, energy availability and fuel mix during the period 1990
to 2100. Through understanding of the global carbon cycle and
of atmospheric chemistry, these emissions can be used to project
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols and
the perturbation of natural radiative forcing. Climate models
can then be used to develop projections of future climate.
<P>
&#176; The increasing realism of simulations of current and past
climate by coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models has increased
our confidence in their use for projection of future climate change.
Important uncertainties remain, but these have been taken into
account in the full range of projections of global mean temperature
and sea level change.
<P>
&#176; For the mid-range IPCC emission scenario, IS92a, assuming
the &quot;best estimate&quot; value of climate sensitivity and
including the effects of future increases in aerosol, models project
an increase in global mean surface air temperature relative to
1990 of about 2lC by 2100. This estimate is approximately one
third lower than the &quot;best estimate&quot; in 1990. This is
due primarily to lower emission scenarios (particularly for CO2
and the CFCs), the inclusion of the cooling effect of sulphate
aerosols, and improvements in the treatment of the carbon cycle.
Combining the lowest IPCC emission scenario (IS92c) with a &quot;low&quot;
value of climate sensitivity and including the effects of future
changes in aerosol concentrations leads to a projected increase
of about 1lC by 2100. The corresponding projection for the highest
IPCC scenario (IS92e) combined with a &quot;high&quot; value of
climate sensitivity gives a warming of about 3.5lC. In all cases
the average rate of warming would probably be greater than any
seen in the last 10,000 years, but the actual annual to decadal
changes would include considerable natural variability. Regional
temperature changes could differ substantially from the global
mean value. Because of the thermal inertia of the oceans, only
50-90% of the eventual equilibrium temperature change would have
been realised by 2100 and temperature would continue to increase
beyond 2100, even if concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilised
by that time.
<P>
&#176; Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal
expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets.
For the IS92a scenario, assuming the &quot;best estimate&quot;
values of climate sensitivity and of ice melts ensitivi ty to
warming, and including the effects of future changes in aerosol,
models project an increase in sea level of about 50 cm from the
present to 2100. This estimate is approximately 25% lower than
the &quot;best estimate&quot; in 1990 due to the lower temperature
projection, but also reflecting improvements in the climate and
ice melt models. Combining the lowest emission scenario (IS92c)
with the &quot;low&quot; climate and ice melt sensitivities and
including aerosol effects gives a projected sea level rise of
about 15 cm from the present to 2100. The corresponding projection
for the highest emission scenario (IS92e) combined with &quot;high&quot;
climate and ice-melt sensitivities gives a sea level rise of about
95 cm from the present to 2100. Sea level would continue to rise
at a similar rate in future centuries beyond 2100, even if concentrations
of greenhouse gases were stabilised by that time, and would continue
to do so even beyond the time of stabilisation of global mean
temperature. Regional sea level changes may differ from the global
mean value owing to land movement and ocean current changes.
<P>
&#176; Confidence is higher in the hemispheric-to-continental
scale projections of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models than
in the regional projections, where confidence remains low. There
is more confidence in temperature projections than hydrological
changes.
<P>
&#176; All model simulations, whether they were forced with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone, show the following features:
greater surface warming of the land than of the sea in winter;
a maximum surface warming in high northern latitudes in winter,
little surface warming over the Arctic in summer; an enhanced
global mean hydrological cycle, and increased precipitation and
soil moisture in high latitudes in winter. All these changes are
associated with identifiable physical mechanisms.
<P>
&#176; In addition, most simulations show a reduction in the strength
of the north Atlantic thermohaline circulation and a widespread
reduction in diurnal range of temperature. These features too
can be explained in terms of identifiable physical mechanisms.
<P>
&#176; The direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic aerosols
have an important effect on the projections. Generally, the magnitudes
of the temperature and precipitation changes are smaller when
aerosol effects are represented, especially in northern mid-latitudes.
Note that the cooling effect of aerosols is not a simple offset
to the warming effect of greenhouse gases, but significantly affects
some of the continental scale patterns of climate change, most
noticeably in the summer hemisphere. For example, models that
consider only the effects of greenhouse gases generally project
an increase in precipitation and soil moisture in the Asian summer
monsoon region, whereas models that include , in addition, some
of the effects of aerosols suggest that monsoon precipitation
may decrease. The spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols
greatly influence regional projections, which are therefore more
uncertain.
<P>
&#176; A general warming is expected to lead to an increase in
the occurrence of extremely hot days and a decrease in the occurrence
of extremely cold days.
<P>
&#176; Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological
cycle; this translates into prospects for more severe droughts
and/or floods in some places and less severe droughts and/or floods
in other places. Several models indicate an increase in precipitation
intensity, suggesting a possibility for more extreme rainfall
events. Knowledge is currently insufficient to say whether there
will be any changes in the occurrence or geographical distribution
of severe storms, e.g., tropical cyclones.
<P>
&#176; Sustained rapid climate change could shift the competitive
balance among species and even lead to forest dieback, altering
the terrestrial uptake and release of carbon. The magnitude is
uncertain, but could be between zero and 200 GtC over the next
one to two centuries, depending on the rate of climate change.
<P>
<B>There are still many uncertainties</B> 
<P>
Many factors currently limit our ability to project and detect
future climate change. In particular, to reduce uncertainties
further work is needed on the following priority topics:
<P>
&#176; estimation of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling
(including sources and sinks) of greenhouse gases, aerosols and
aerosol precursors and projections of future concentrations and
radiative properties.
<P>
&#176; representation of climate processes in models, especially
feedbacks associated with clouds, oceans, sea ice and vegetation,
in order to improve projections of rates and regional patterns
of climate change.
<P>
&#176; systematic collection of long-term instrumental and proxy
observations of climate system variables (e.g., solar output,
atmospheric energy balance components, hydrological cycles, ocean
characteristics and ecosystem changes) for the purposes of model
testing, assessment of temporal and regional variability and for
detection and attribution studies.
<P>
Future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes (as
have occurred in the past) are, by their nature difficult to predict.
This implies that future climate changes may also involve &quot;surprises&quot;.
In particular these arise from the non-linear nature of the climate
system. When rapidly forced, non-linear systems are especially
subject to unexpected behaviour. Progress can be made by investigating
non-linear processes and sub-components of the climatic system.
Examples of such non-linear behaviour include rapid circulation
changes in the North Atlantic and feedbacks associated with terrestrial
ecosystem changes.
