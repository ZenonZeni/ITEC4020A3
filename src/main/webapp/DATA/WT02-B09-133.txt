<IMG SRC="bl19.gif"><B>Fast Ehternet Throughput</B><br>
<A HREF="special.htm">Fast Ethernet</A> delivers ten times the bandwidth of 10BASE-T Ethernet.  An analogy will help illustrate this tenfold increase in performance. Think of switched 10 Mbps Ehternet as a ten-lane freeway where the speed limit is 10MPH and shared 100Mbps Ehternet as a one-lane freeway where the speed limit is 100MPH.  Even though a switched 10 freeway has 10 lanes, it still takes 10 times as long to get from here to there.  Taking the anaolgy one step further, switched 100 Mbps Ehternet is then a 10-lane autobahn where the speed limit is 100MPH.
