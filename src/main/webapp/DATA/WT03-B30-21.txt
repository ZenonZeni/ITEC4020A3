Clinton vetoes DOD authorization, VA-HUD

     President Clinton last month vetoed a pair of bills 
that include stipulations for environmental cleanup.
     On Dec. 28, the president vetoed the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, 
which approves funding levels and provides 
guidance for the Defense Dept.'s cleanup programs. 
Clinton cited the bill's direction to "slow the pace of 
[DOD's] environmental cleanup efforts" among his 
reasons for the rejection.
     H.R. 1530 would have set a spending ceiling this 
fiscal year for DOD's Defense Environmental 
Restoration Account (DERA) at $1.422 billion -- 
$200 million less than Clinton requested.
     Also for DERA, Congress said it expected 
DOD's environmental security program to reduce 
funding for administrative, support, studies, and 
investigations to 20% of total funding by FY 1997.
     The bill also directed DOD to report by April 1 
on progress made in reducing spending on 
administration and studies and on actions it plans to 
further reduce spending.
     Clinton also vetoed the VA-HUD and 
Independent Agencies Appropriations bill, Dec. 18.
     That bill -- which funds EPA Superfund -- 
returns to conference, where it probably will gather 
dust until the administration and congressional 
Republicans can compromise on a balanced budget 
for the next several years.

**Hundreds of contract Superfund workers sent 
home

     Clinton cited cuts to environmental programs as 
one of his reasons for vetoing the $80.6 billion 
appropriations bill, which included $1.163 billion for 
Superfund, almost $400 million less than he 
requested.
     "We cut low-priority EPA items," said Sen. Kit 
Bond, R-Mo., who chaired the conference 
committee. "We've done as good a job as possible 
under the circumstances."
     The VA-HUD and Independent Agencies bill 
would have provided $5.7 billion for EPA in FY 
1996, which began Oct. 1.
     Superfund had continued relatively unscathed, 
due to a surplus in the trust fund. But because of the 
government shutdown, EPA stopped work at 609 
Superfund sites -- all but those of highest priority -- 
on Wednesday.

Division Profile
Downsized SWD should weather div. cut well

     DALLAS -- Set up in 1937 to design and build 
flood-control and hydropower reservoirs, the Corps' 
Southwestern Div. now logs mileage daily down all 
the Corps' major avenues: environmental 
stewardship, HTRW cleanup, military construction, 
disaster relief, and work for other federal agencies.
     Southwestern Div. covers 18% of the nation's 
landmass (see maps on p.3) and 28% of the land the 
Corps regards as its own. More than 15% of the 
nation's waterborne commerce plies SWD's 
waterways, particularly along its 426 miles of the 
Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The division operates 
18 hydropower projects and 98 lakes.
     The division office here provides oversight to five 
districts: Albuquerque, Fort Worth (CR, 11/24/95), 
Tulsa (CR, 2/17/95), Galveston (CR, 12/8/95), and 
Little Rock (CR, 2/3/95).
     SWD does design and construction at 10 active 
Army and 14 active Air Force installations. It 
manages HTRW cleanup at various Air Force and 
Army installations and for the Dept. of Energy at the 
Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas.
     The Dallas office estimates SWD's military 
programs are worth $961 million. In fiscal year 
1995, it spent $384.8 million of the $465 million 
made available for its civil works.
     Some careful reprogramming enabled mission 
execution in civil works during FY 1995 came in at 
greater than 100% of what Dallas scheduled.

*****
Southwestern Div. Program Execution, FY 1995 (in 
millions)
Category     Scheduled     Expended
Operations and maintenance     $237.5     $236.7
Construction, general          $104.2     $108.3
General investigation           $15.4     $14.1

     "You can reprogram monies to another 
authorized project in civil works," explained Acting 
Chief of Civil Programs Jerry Penland, "but you 
can't do it on the military side - not even from one 
project to another at the same installation."
     Penland, who spent 10 years in military-project 
planning with Transatlantic Programs Center, said 
SWD plans to get its civil carryover down to zero by 
FY 1998.

**Division twice escaped death sentence

     The division has 219 full-time equivalencies -- 
184 at the Federal Building in Dallas, 28 at the SWD 
lab on Cass St. in Dallas, and seven more in 
reservoir control. The division already downsized 
because of anticipated restructuring in the 1991 and 
1992 plans, which were rejected by Congress, and 
hasn't built back up. Programs Management Director 
Ed Cohn doesn't anticipate any layoffs, as the Corps 
continues to downsize.
     The 1991 restructuring plan would have closed 
the division office in Dallas and sent most of its 
districts and work to a new South Central Div. in 
Vicksburg, Miss., with the rest going to a new 
Southwest Div. in San Francisco. The 1992 plan also 
would have closed the Dallas office.
     "The flags were supposed to go up on the new 
divisions in February of '93," said Paul Robinson, 
acting director of Engineering and Technical 
Services. "And that didn't happen."
     At the time SWD had a military program worth 
more than $1 billion and a civil-works program 
worth more than $400 million. Combined with 
Lower Mississippi Valley Div.'s civil-works 
program of more than $1 billion, and allowing for 
Albuquerque Dist.'s move to the West, the new 
South Central Div. would have had a total program 
worth more than $2 billion.
     Now the brass in Dallas thinks the division is safe 
because, unlike LMVD or North Central Div. (two 
primarily civil-works divisions), SWD is top heavy 
with no major Corps mission. 
     Fort Worth Dist. has about a $300 million annual 
military program. Galveston has a vibrant civil 
program. 
     And Tulsa Dist., which would have closed under 
the 1991 restructuring plan, today is robust as 
SWD's HTRW design district. The division's 
HTRW program -- just $12 million in 1990 -- 
jumped to nearly $110 million in FY 1995. Tulsa 
has two Total Environmental Restoration Contracts, 
which together are worth more than $500 million.  

**Each district has its niche

     Albuquerque Dist.'s workload has held steady 
because of its commitment to family housing.
     "That's unique to them," said Louis Carr, SWD's 
acting director of Construction/Operations Div. 
"They were able to go out and develop the 
relationship with the Air Force that enabled them to 
become the designer for Air Force family housing."
     Good thing. Albuquerque does far more work for 
the Air Force than for the Army.
     "The selling point," said Robinson, "was the 
design/build approach. They streamlined that process 
for family housing."
     Tulsa Dist. is unique for combining engineering 
and construction in the same division. It looks as 
though base closings and realignments designated in 
this year's round will bring $220 million of work to 
four sites in Tulsa Dist.
     "We're waiting for the [specific assignments 
from] BRAC '95 to get finalized," said Aldo 
Brazzale, chief of Military and HTRW Programs 
Division in Programs Management. "And there is 
some BRAC '95 work in Tulsa's area, based on what 
is in the BRAC '95 program. We don't know yet 
how much of that will come to pass, but there's 
some work at McAlester [Army Ammunition Plant, 
Okla.], some work at Tinker [AFB, Okla.], for 
instance."
     Little Rock Dist. is becoming what the Corps 
thinks of as a mature district. Nearly all of its civil-
works appropriations go toward operating and 
maintaining its projects. Indeed, the Corps' civil-
works side as a whole seems headed in that 
direction, toward merely operating its projects.
     Even so, Fort Chaffee, Ark., should get about 
$25 million of environmental-restoration work in 
either fiscal year 1996 or 1997.

PK wins $16M for smolt-monitoring works

     PK Contractors won a $16.02 million Portland 
Dist. contract, Dec. 13, to build a juvenile-fish 
sampling and monitoring facility at John Day Dam 
on the Columbia River.
     The Spokane, Wash., company beat out 
Humphrey Construction, Woodinville, Wash., 
which bid $16.85 million; Harcon Inc., also of 
Spokane, which bid $17.85 million; Haskell 
Construction, Bellingham, Wash., $19.2 million; and 
Abhe and Svoboda Inc., Prior Lake, Minn., which 
bid $24.46 million.
     The government estimated the job, which is part 
of the Corps' Columbia River Fish Mitigation 
Program, at $17.04 million.
     PK went right to work, starting construction late 
last month on the elevated, three-part, fish-passage 
system that will extend more than 2,400 feet. The 
apparatus will include adult holding and sampling 
areas and expand juvenile-fish monitoring 
capabilities at John Day. It should be ready by 
summer of 1997.
     Once the facility comes on line, biologists from 
the Corps, the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
and other fishery agencies will monitor and sample 
the fish, and analyze the data on-site. Biologists will 
tag the fish and release them back into the Columbia, 
downstream of the powerhouse.
     The Corps will operate the facility.
     Biologists will do a variety of research "relevant 
to all migrating species" at John Day, said Portland 
Dist. Spokeswoman Dawn Edwards. 
     "Radio-tracking and hydro-acoustics will tell us 
where the fish are approaching the project," added 
Project Manager Stuart Stanger.
     Biologists will use the survival data to assist in-
season and long-term management of the river 
system.
      The fish-passage system will have a 1,200-foot-
long, five-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep chute extending 
along the Oregon shoreline from the powerhouse to 
a dewatering building, which will be 100 feet long by 
40 feet wide.
     A funnel effect will direct the juveniles to the 
dewatering building. From there, they will travel 
about 1,200 feet through a transport flume to the 
sampling and monitoring building. A computerized 
monitoring system then will determine survival rates 
and travel times by analyzing passive-integrated-
transponder (PIT) tags placed in the fish at various 
hatchery and upriver capture locations.
     Interested subcontractors should call PK Project 
Manager Brent Ridge at 360-779-9341 or PK's 
Spokane office at 509-536-7503.

ORD to help clean acid-mine drainage

     CINCINNATI -- The Ohio River Div. is offering 
to help states and organizations clean up rivers and 
streams that have become acidic due to discharges 
from coal mines.
     Division Program Manager Debby Chenoweth 
and Environmental Engineer Bob Hahn discussed 
ways to work with the Corps at a Mine Drainage 
Workshop here sponsored by the Terrene Institute. 
The workshop drew nearly 150 people: federal 
officials from the Corps, EPA, the Office of Surface 
Mining, and the Dept. of Agriculture; state officials; 
activists looking for ways to restore streams; and 
mining-company representatives.
     Chenoweth said the Corps could help 
environmental groups, states, and other federal 
agencies. However, she discouraged the idea that the 
Corps had limitless resources. West Virginia Dept. 
of Environmental Protection Director Eli McCoy 
had earlier described the Corps as the "Daddy 
Warbucks" of government agencies.
     Because the areas in the eastern United States 
contaminated by acid-mine drainage "almost exactly 
parallel Ohio River Div.'s boundaries," Chenoweth 
noted, ORD districts -- Pittsburgh, Huntington, 
Louisville, and Nashville -- might be further along 
than others with these programs.
     Many workshop speakers mentioned the Corps 
as a source of funding for combating acid-mine 
drainage. Office of Surface Mining Director Robert 
Uram said states could match their "abandoned mine 
lands" funds, which are used to reclaim old mine 
sites, with Corps funds. An official in charge of 
coordinating USDA's natural resources conservation 
service suggested tapping Corps funding because 
acid-mine drainage affects water-resource 
management.
      Hahn outlined four Corps programs, which 
could be used.
     * Authorized Corps projects have two key 
advantages: the Corps supplies half the funding and 
manages the program from design through 
operation. However, with these projects customers 
must lobby their congressional leaders as they have 
to survive the congressional budget battles.
     * The Support for Others program requires less 
time and money, Hahn said, plus the customer can 
set a project's scope. However, the Corps provides 
no money and only limited manpower for such 
projects.
     * If a customer wants a lot of Corps funding, 
Hahn added, it could show the quality of its 
watershed affects a Corps project as outlined in the 
Section 1135 environmental-restoration program. 
Restoration jobs have difficulty fitting the strict 
limitations of scope and location, but if the job falls 
into this category it can receive 75% of its money 
from the Corps.
     * Finally, the Corps will provide half of the 
money states need for watershed-restoration 
planning. However, this planning assistance program 
has a limited budget and will not pay for the actual 
work of putting concrete in the ground or 
establishing wetlands.
     "We don't have any specific amount of money set 
aside," Chenoweth said, but interested states and 
organizations need to get in line as soon as possible 
to get Corps feasibility studies started for their 
projects. Feasibility studies generally take about a 
year.
     Hahn reminded the workshop that the Corps also 
provides technical assistance -- on regulations, 
federal and state programs, geology, hydrology, 
meteorology, and consultation -- at no cost. He urged 
people to contact a Corps office.
     "We're eager to help," Hahn said.
     As examples of projects using Corps funds and 
technical assistance, Chenoweth mentioned two in 
Ohio: a $400,000 project at Wills Creek, where fly 
ash will be used to treat acid-mine drainage, and a $4 
million project at Piedmont Lake.

**Problem requires long trip to recovery

     Acid-mine drainage contributes to water pollution 
where old underground and surface coal mines were 
abandoned before federal regulations required mine 
operators to reclaim the properties.
     Many streams in Appalachian coal fields suffer 
from acid-mine drainage. When sulphur-bearing 
rock meets oxygen, it can create an acid that is 
carried into nearby streams by surface runoff or 
groundwater. The acid leaches heavy metals from the 
earth and lowers the pH of the streams.
     Correcting the problem requires expensive 
techniques. Physical measures include filling an 
underground mine with fly ash, building concrete 
dikes to contain groundwater, and establishing 
wetlands to serve as a natural filter. Restoration 
projects also use chemical measures, such as  
administering alkaline materials to a stream through 
"doser" silos or piles dumped along its banks to 
bring the water up to a neutral pH level.
     For more information on the ORD acid-mine 
drainage programs call Chenoweth at 513-684-6038 
or Hahn at -6201.

BRAC shuts down -- perhaps till 2001

     The Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
(BRAC), the independent agency Congress created 
to insulate elected officials from shutting down 
excess military capacity remaining after the Cold 
War, closed itself last week, after shuttering 243 
domestic military bases since 1988.
     "We saved the taxpayers over $5 billion a year for 
the next four years, and we did it for under $13 
million," said Charles Smith, the last executive 
director of BRAC.
     Former BRAC Chairman Alan Dixon, who 
presided over the fourth round of BRAC last year, 
sometimes found himself confronted by parents 
holding the children they said would starve if bases 
near their homes closed.
     Because the 20% of domestic bases closing down 
still leaves slack in the military infrastructure, 
Dixon's commission recommended a fifth round of 
BRAC -- but not until 2001.
     Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who helped write the 
legislation creating the commission, said shrinking 
Defense budgets could mean pressure to close more 
bases will come sooner, and from the military 
services: "They don't enjoy it, either. But when it's 
either that or not modernize, it makes a difference."
     Before Congress's Office of Technology 
Assessment closed in September, it observed that 
base closures usually occur in areas that can absorb 
the job loss and usually make available valuable real 
estate.

Lancaster confirmation delayed

     Martin Lancaster's confirmation as the new

will have to wait until resolution of the budget 
stalemate, the nominee said just before Christmas.
     "I had hoped to be confirmed before the 
holidays," Lancaster told The Corps Report, "but 
now it looks as though all confirmations will be put 
off until" Congress and the White House agree on a 
final budget for fiscal year 1996.

Renovation, CTR, Wainwright OK'd

     When the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 
year 1996 became law on Dec 1., it cleared money 
for three Corps projects whose appropriations were 
in doubt.
     It finalized the conference agreement to give the 
Pentagon Renovation $108.02 million for FY 1996 
(CR, 9/29/95) and to consolidate renovation funding 
in the "Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide" 
account.
     It funded the Cooperative Threat Reduction 
(CTR) program, which gives a lot of work to 
Transatlantic Programs Center, at $300 million for 
FY 1996 -- $71 million below the president's 
request. CTR aims to reduce the nuclear threat in the 
former Soviet Union, in part through incentives such 
as building housing for retired military officers.
     Also, House and Senate conferees put $8 million 
toward emergency repairs at the Fort Wainwright 
Central Heat and Power Plant, in Anchorage, Alaska. 
That makes money available for Sol. DACA85-95-
B-0031 (CR, 8/18/95).
