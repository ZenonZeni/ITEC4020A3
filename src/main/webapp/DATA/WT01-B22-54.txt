<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Much of the scientific research which purports to show toxic
effects from marijuana has come from one man, Dr. Gabriel Nahas.
Dr. Nahas' research over the years has shown a number of bad
effects, such suppression of the immune system, and various other
toxic effects. </p>

<p>Dr. Nahas, however, is not without his critics. The following
is an abstract of a review of some of Dr. Nahas' work which
appeared in Drug and Alcohol Review. </p>

<p>The authors' address is: Department of Pharmacology,

<p><b>Commentary</b> </p>

<p><b>The human toxicity of marijuana: a critique of a review by
Nahas and Latour.</b> </p>

<p>by Macdonald J. Christie &amp; Greogory B. Chesher </p>

Wales,Australia </p>

<p><b>Abstract</b> </p>

<p>A review entitled &quot;The human toxicity of marijuana&quot;
was published in 1992 in the Medical Journal of Australia. The
authors claimed that the adverse effects of cannabis use have
been trivialised and that the effects are much more serious than
earlier reported. We have made a careful study of this review and
examined the claims made. We compared the claims of the authors
with the information contained in the documents they cited and
found that at least 28 of the 35 citations in this article were
cited inaccurately. </p>

<p>Five of these publications were misquoted,or the findings of
the study were not fully reported. Twenty-three citations
contained other errors, leaving only six to eight (two citations
could not be traced because of their obscurity) accurate
citations among the 35. All of these inaccuracies operated in the
direction of finding an adverse effect of marijuana. </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>It is not a pleasant task to make an open criticism of a paper
by colleagues, but we feel compelled to do so in the case of a
paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1992.. .
