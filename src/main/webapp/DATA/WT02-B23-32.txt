<P>
<B>Pittsburgh, November 21, 1996</B> Mutual fund software provider,
Confluence Technologies, agrees to install the latest version
of its flagship product, FundStation, at Nicholas Applegate Capital
Management in San Diego. FundStation is the PC-based data repository
for fund accounting and administration departments that automatically
collects and calculates rates of return, yields and end-of-day
fund information, and disseminates it in any format.<BR>
<P>
Mark Bjorstrom, Director of Operations for Nicholas Applegate,
says, &quot;We were looking for a system that would allow us to
calculate our mutual fund returns in the most efficient and accurate
manner. We also wanted to centralize all performance functions,
including those done by our external fund administrator. FundStation
will minimize our manual data entry and spreadsheet calculations,
and we can store NAVs and rates of return for internal and external
dissemination. The e-mail and fax server capabilities will greatly
enhance the timeliness of our mutual fund data distribution.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
President of Confluence Technologies, Mike Schiller, is &quot;delighted
that Nicholas Applegate chose FundStation for quick and accurate
return calculation,&quot; and is &quot;confident that they will
provide even more efficient data distribution, to both internal
and external clients.&quot;<BR>
