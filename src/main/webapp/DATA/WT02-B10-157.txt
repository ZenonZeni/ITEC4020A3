New York State Office of Mental Health<BR>
Seventh Annual Research Conference</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The lights may have gone out for several hours at the Desmond Hotel, where the Seventh Annual New York State Office of Mental Health Research Conference was taking place, but there was no blackout of information transfer! With only flashlights and candles to help them refer to their notes, presenters went right on with their talks and audiences stayed right in their seats. This was a group, stalwart and true to the service of research, who didn't disappoint Dr. John Oldham, Chief Medical Officer of the OMH, Director of Psychiatric Institute, and primary organizer of the Conference.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The subject of violence took a large share of the spotlight at this conference, reflecting the concerns of American society today. In the first plenary session, Dr. Paul Fink, former President of the American Psychiatric Association, who heads the Albert Einstein Center for the Study of Violence, provided a sociological overview of violent behavior. He hardly needed to cite the grim statistics of the ever increasing numbers of assaultive crimes or of the huge amount of violence in what is considered entertainment. With little guidance from home, how are young people to resist the power and the glamour, false though they may be, of violent behavior as depicted by the media? He offered several strategies, ranging from gun control, environmental modifications, and demand for ethical standards in television, to a plea for every person in the audience to become an "enlightened witness," i.e., to take responsibility for just one child who may be suffering from abuse and, by so doing, validate that child's very existence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a special presentation on the last day of the conference, Dr. John Mann, Psychiatric Institute's new Director of Neuroscience, citing many of the same statistics as Dr. Fink had, approached the issue of violence from a neurobiological point of view. Neurochemists from his and other laboratories have demonstrated that reduced levels of serotonergic activity are associated with aggressive and suicidal behavior. They are now exploring ways in which this information may help them in recognizing and treating high risk patients. Anatomists in his group see that lesions in the orbital prefrontal cortex seem to be involved in disinhibition and may lower the threshold for suicidal or aggressive behavior. The researchers are even looking at how cholesterol may play a role in regulating the serotonergic system.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even in the individual paper sessions, researchers concerned themselves with aspects of the problem of violence in society. For example, Dr. Gail Wasserman reported on the first year of her study of the younger brothers of teen-aged adjudicated delinquents, a study designed to determine what the predictors are for similar antisocial behavior in these children. Dr. Rene Hen, speaking from a basic science vantage point, described his work with gene-altered mice in which he studies the function of 5-HT1B in regulating aggressive behavior.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The conference offers an enormous amount of information meant to enhance the knowledge and skills of mental health professionals from all over New York State. In addition to dozens of paper sessions and poster sessions, this year given by a considerable number of people from psychiatric centers in other parts of the United States as well as by researchers from throughout New York State, there were other venues for the exchange of information. There were open forums both for clinicians and researchers and for patients, families, patient advocates, and researchers. In fact, the Office of Mental Health has made a concerted effort to involve consumers of mental health services in the workings of the conference by inviting several of them to participate in the paper sessions, both as discussants and presenters.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Still another feature of the conference which has helped to gain it national attention and importance is the broadcast via satellite television of a two-hour symposium wherein researchers describe aspects of their work and Dr. Oldham, as moderator, takes questions from listeners from as far away as Texas or as close as persons in the first row of the audience. This year, the speakers were Dr. Herbert Pardes, Dean of Columbia's medical school, Dr. Arnold Friedhof from the New York University medical school, Dr. Myrna Weissman, Psychiatric Institute's Director of Clinical Epidemiology, and Dr. Donald Klein, Director of Therapeutics at PI, who replaced Cornell's Dr. Jack Barchas, unable to come because of illness.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All this does not convey the camaraderie and conviviality of the conference. Dr. Robert Cancro, Director of the Nathan Kline Psychiatric Institute, gave public credit to Dr. Oldham for this feeling at the Research Awards dinner the second evening. This year's honorees were Dr. Marvin Herz from the University of Rochester, Dr. Alexander Glassman from Psychiatric Institute,  and Dr. Abel Lajtha from Nathan Kline's Center for Neurochemistry.

Annual Scientific Conference
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the last decade of the 20th century, it is not in the arts that we find the most innovative or imaginative work taking place, observed Dr. Eric Kandel at Psychiatric Institute's Annual Scientific Conference at Arden House in November, but in the sciences, particularly in neurobiology. Dr. Kandel, Director of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, was the after-dinner speaker at the conference and he once again dazzled the audience with his approach to what he called "the central unsolved issue in biology: the problem of the mind." Describing two forms of learning, the explicit and the implicit, he explained some of the brain mechanisms which transform short-term memory into long-term memory. Elegant reasoning and an imaginative leap into the future brought him to predict a "little red pill" which will enhance memory. The real revolution in the field of psychiatry, he stressed, is the merger between cognitive psychology and neuroscience which is invigorating scientists to explore cognition and emotion from the point of view of molecular biology, as exemplified by his laboratories.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, a talk given the following morning by a member of Psychiatric Institute's Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, Dr. Rene Hen, provided a glimpse of the "gene knock-out" strategy researchers are using in mice to chart specific changes in behavior that mimic human behavior. Dr. Hen's presentation followed an overview of studies from the neuroscience laboratories of Dr. John Mann. Dr. Mann and his colleagues are looking at aggression and suicide from a biological vantage point: on the one hand, they use imaging technology to localize impaired circuitry in the brain, and, on the other, they utilize chemical probes to explore such areas as the relationship of serotonin to high cholesterol.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Arden House Conference traditionally gives Institute researchers an opportunity to hear about the wide variety of studies being conducted by their colleagues. It opened this year with presentations covering some long-term studies. Dr. Rachel Klein, talking about anxiety and learning disorders in children, confirmed that childhood separation anxiety can result in panic disorder in adults, but learning disorders, often considered a risk factor for future psychopathology, do not necessarily result in psychiatric disorders in adults. Dr. Salvatore Mannuzza pointed out that children with Attention Deficit Disorder were more likely than controls to exhibit antisocial behavior, abuse alcohol and drugs, attain a lower level of academic success, and suffer affective disorders in adulthood. Dr. Susan Wolk, describing a longitudinal study of childhood depression, concluded that it is "recurrent and disabling over time."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reporting on new research, Dr. Jonathan Javitch spoke of the molecular level investigations of the binding sites of different antipsychotic drugs. Other reports of new research included a study by Dr. Sharon Schwartz which found no evidence of higher rates of disorder among the children of Holocaust survivors, and a Washington Heights study by Dr. Ann Stueve which found that stressful life events do not necessarily make depression worse unless they take place within three months before the onset of the disorder. Dr. Mitchell Nobler reported that ECT acutely decreases regional cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate, while Dr. Xavier Amador made the connection between schizophrenic patients' low insight into their illness and treatment non-compliance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As has been customary, the conference included a choice of six workshops during the afternoon session. And for the second year, posters provided additional information about other research projects currently underway at the Institute. The presentations with which the two-day meetings ended concerned the difficult-to-treat patient. As Dr. Zafar Sharif pointed out in the first talk on schizophrenia, the clinician must take the following steps in dealing with the refractory patient: carefully reconsider the diagnosis, ascertain whether medication dosage is adequate, assess compliance, and consider side effects. <BR>
Dr. Steven Roose, talking about depression, added a consideration of the duration of treatment and the possible augmentation of standard treatment with other strategies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once again, the success of the conference was in large part due to the work of the program committee, Drs. Stanley Bone, Francine Cournos, David Kahn, Judith Rabkin, and Stephen Rayport, and to the administrative coordinator, Ms. Myra Stewart.
