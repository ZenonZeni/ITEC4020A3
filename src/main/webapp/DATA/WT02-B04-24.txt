<center><H3>ARROGANT DECISION CONTRADICTS PRIOR CASES<BR>
ON PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTION TO MINORS, FRC SAYS</H3></center>

<p>

<center><h4>FRC Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver says decision on<BR>

the Communications Decency Act not a pro-family defeat</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;What else should we expect from

an ACLU-hand-picked judge than a sweeping, radical decision allowing

adults to knowingly send and display pornography to minors on

the Internet?&quot; Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said

Wednesday. &quot;Nevertheless, this is not an ultimate defeat

for American families and children.  No matter where this case

goes next - either to the full Eastern District Court or the Supreme

Court - the Department of Justice will have a better opportunity

to defend the constitutionality of this statute.&quot;


<p>

Cleaver made her remarks as the Federal District Court for the

Eastern District of Pennsylvania released their decision Wednesday

on the <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> case involving the regulation of pornography

distribution to minors on the Internet.  Family Research Council

presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief defending the

cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  The decision,

written by Dolores K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit

Court of Appeals and Carter appointee, contradicts previous Supreme

Court decisions on the distribution of indecent material through

the media.


<p>

&quot;It is an arrogant decision which flies in the face of the

Supreme Court and our society,&quot; Cleaver said.&quot; We have

long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful material

have the obligation to keep the material from children. Outside

cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually explicit

images in public places and from selling porn magazines to children.

So, on the Internet, the burden of protecting children from exploitation

should not rest solely on the parents.&quot;


<p>

In her decision, Judge Sloviter maintains that it is &quot;either

technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for

pornographers to comply with the regulations. However, Cleaver

said that &quot;this decision reflects the Court's unwillingness

to consider proposed regulations by dismissing them as 'burdensome.'

There are constitutional ways to protect children from cyberporn

but not restrict the freedom of speech of the pornographers or

the adults.&quot;


<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Cyberspace is a work in progress. We

should not squander the opportunity to examine and appreciate

a world where pornography knows no bounds. Failure to enact strong

laws is a concession that the information superhighway should

belong to pornographers.  It would be like leaving a loaded gun

in a playground.&quot;
