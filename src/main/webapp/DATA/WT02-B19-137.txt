The department's major research facilities in this area include the following laboratories: Environmental Fluid Dynamics 
(Prof. M.R. Loewen), and Zebra Mussel (Prof. J. Spelt).<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/chandra.html"> <b> Professor S. Chandra </b></a>
<br>
Development of air filtration systems to remove sub-
micron sized particles from an air stream. 
Experimentation to observe the motion of air-borne 
particles in an electric field. Development of computer 
codes to model air filtration.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/keffer.html"> <b> Professor J.F. Keffer </b></a>
<br>
Experimental and computational research in turbulence 
such as jets, wakes, boundary layers and complex 
turbulent flows as applied to oceanographic, limnological 
and meteorological environments, using computer 
analysis, digital imaging, flow visualization, pattern 
recognition and CFD.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/loewen.html"> <b> Professor M.R. Loewen </b></a>
<br>
Determining the importance of the large bubbles 
entrained by breaking waves to air-sea gas exchange. 
Experimental investigation of turbulence and mixing in 
ultraviolet waste-water disinfection systems. Transport of 
toxic chemicals between the atmosphere and the Great 
Lakes.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/mandelis.html"> <b> Professor A. Mandelis </b></a>
<br>
Research and Development of a family of new solid-state 
gas sensors for environmental pollution monitoring, and 
primarily for hydrogen, hydrocarbon and helium trace 
gas detection, with a view to the era of safe hydrogen 
energy production and utilization.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/park.html"> <b> Professor C.B. Park </b></a>
<br>
Development of environmentally-safe blowing agents in 
microcellular plastic foam processing: the development 
of a sorption system to measure the solubility and 
diffusivity of an environmentally sound blowing agent, 
and the investigation of the surfactant effect on the foam 
morphology.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/shu.html"> <b> Professor L. Shu </b></a>
<br>
Environmentally responsible product design. Such design 
aims to produce minimal environmental impact during 
product manufacture, life, recycling, and disposal. 
Resource inputs and waste outputs over the product life-
cycle are useful metrics for comparing environmental 
impact of various product designs. Computer tools and 
optimization methods are used to determine minimal-
impact designs for particular applications and to develop 
general guidelines for environmentally conscious product 
design.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/spelt.html"> <b> Professor J.K. Spelt </b></a>
<br>
Research on prevention biofouling of zebra mussels in 
fresh water due to copper release into fresh water from a 
variety of copper-containing surfaces. An improved 
understanding of these ultra-low corrosion rates will aid 
in the development of new antifouling surfaces and 
provide data to estimate the environmental loading of 
copper.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/thomson.html"> <b> Professor M. Thomson </b></a>
<br>
Experimental and numerical studies on the control of air 
pollution from industrial sources. Investigating the 
pollutant generating processes by taking measurements 
on a laboratory scale combustor for a range of operating 
conditions. Developing predictive models of the fluid 
flow and chemical reactions that control pollutant 
formation. Modeling emissions from a steel melting 
preheater.  Investigating the use of additives to enhance 
VOC destruction, and reducing CO and NOx emissions 
through, improved turbulent mixing.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/wallace.html"> <b> Professor J.S. Wallace </b></a>
<br>
Catalytic after treatment of exhaust gas for reducing the 
amounts of combustion generated air pollutants: 
Examining the effectiveness of novel means of achieving 
faster catalyst light off to reduce the amount of time that 
engine emissions pass through the catalyst unreacted. <p>
