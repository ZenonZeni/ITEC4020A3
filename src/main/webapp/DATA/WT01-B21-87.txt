<p>STATEMENT OF HERBERT J. WOLLNER, CONSULTING CHEMIST, OFFICE OF
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Mr. Chairman, my name is Herbert J. Wollner; I am
consulting chemist in the office of the Secretary of the
Treasury.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: You may proceed.</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: The acttive principle in marihuana appears to be
associated with an element which is located or found in the
flowering tops and on the under side of the leaves of the plant.
Until relatively recently the lack oof refined chemical tests has
built up the traditional conception that it was only found in the
co-called female plant. But that is untrue. We have discovered
that it is present both in the male and female plant.</p>

<p>To iluminate the matter I have brought with me some slides, if
you care to look at them through the lenses, which I will be glad
to submit for your examination.</p>

<p>(The slides referred to were examined by the members of the
committee.)</p>

<p>Those are the flowering tops, and the plant is covered with a
tremendous number of very fine hairs. You will notice that at the
base of these hairs are little pockets, liike apertures, where
little sacks of resin are located. The resin contains an
ingredient which the chemical technologist referes to as
cannabinone or cannabinol, alternatively. It is the invariant
experience that this material contains the active principle which
does the job.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: How do they get this into commercial use? I am
talking about the flowering plantt. Do they have to take it in
its natural state?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: There are a variety of ways. In the early days,
when they used hashish, they would jounce the flowering tops up
and down in bags and then the resin would collect on the surface
of the cloth and was scraped off and mixed with sweets and eath.
At the present time in reefers and muggles there is no
separation. They smoke the stuff in toto, the leaves, the
flowering tops, and everything.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: They use the whole thing?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Yes. In the laboratory we extract this resin and
then identify it.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: After that it is dried quicker?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Yes, It goes through a process which is simlar to
the process through which tobacco goes. They are similar in that
respect.</p>

<p>MR. REED: As to this ingredient at the root of this hairlike
substance, is that in the nature of oil?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Yes and no. This active substance will be
extractible from the resin. It is on the border line between
resin and oil. If you raise the temperature slightly, it becomes
fluid.</p>

<p>The identification problems have been worked out very clearly
from the botanical and from the purely laborattory approach, and
that is in such shape right now that the transmission of that
information to police officers throughout the country would be
perfectly possible.</p>

<p>MR. CROWTHER: Is that the oil that the manufacgtureres used to
produce in considerable quantities?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: That is a different oil. That oil derives its
source from the seed of the marihuana plant. The seed of hte
plant contains a drying oil which is in a general way similar to
that of linseed. Those seeds contain a small amount of that
resin, appparently on their outer surface according to quite a
number of investigators depending upon the age of that seed.</p>

<p>The oil in the seed or the seed itself only contains the
active principle, apparently, where derived from an immature
plant. However, cerain investigators have found active principles
in smaller amounts even in mature seeds.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: It has been testified that the common manner of
use is tthrough cigarettes. Is anyone manufacturing those
cigarettes for sale, or do you just roll them?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: As I understand it from our law-enforcment
officers, both procedures are in common usage.</p>

<p>It is also sold in the form of loose tobacco, either mized or
straight.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: Do you know of any concern that is manufacturing
cigarettes with the marihuana content?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: I would not know of such a concern in the course
of my own experience.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: The addicts can roll their own?</p>

<p>MR. BUCK: Does the oil from the seed contain any of this
deleterious matter?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: That would in a large measure depend upon the
condition of the seed and the condition of manufacture, bit I
would say in any event the oil would not contain a large amount
of this resin.</p>

<p>It may be that that quantity active principle which is in the
oil was derived through contact with other parts of the plant.</p>

<p>MR. BUCK: Would it contain enough to have any harmful effect
on anyone, if taken internally?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: I would say no; it would not contain such an
amount.</p>

<p>MR. FULLER: As I understand it, you say the oil dos not
contain much, if any, of the drug?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: It does contain some fo the drug, but not much.
It woudl appear, offhand, to be rather difficult to spearate, but
processes might possibly be developed for that purpose.</p>

<p>MR. FULLER: It would not be useful for the purpose for which
they are using marihuana.</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: No.</p>

<p>MR. FULLER: So, so far as the oil from the seed is concerned,
it is harmless, as far as human use is concerned.</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: That is right.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: We thank you for your statement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hester, who is your next witness?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman, we have one other witness, Dr.
Dewey, who was formerly chief of the fiber investigation of the
Bureau of Plant Industry in the Department of Agriculture. He is
a botanist, and while he is noe in retirement, officials of the
Department of Agriculture have referred us to him as the foremost
expert on the botanical aspect of this plant.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Is he now connected with the Department of
Agriculture?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: No, he is not, he is now in retirement.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: We will be glad to hear Dr. Dewey. Will you give
your full name to the reporter?</p>
