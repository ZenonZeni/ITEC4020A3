Cash-strapped Navy seeking softer deals

     Declining funding has forced the Navy to get tougher 
with environmental regulators in cleanup agreement 
negotiations.
     However, the Navy is discovering it's too late to back out 
of agreements already made.
     In a recent guidance for active-base cleanups, the Navy's 
assistant secretary for installations and environment said, 
"enforceable milestones in negotiated legal agreements must 
fit within budget and FYDP [five-year defense plan] 
controls."
     The assistant secretary, Robert Pirie, added all new 
agreements must provide for "'rolling milestones' 
established in the light of relative risk and budget 
considerations." Under this approach cleanup deadlines only 
will become enforceable in the year Congress funds the 
cleanup work.
     Pirie also urged the Navy to revisit existing legal 
agreements with environmental regulators. The agreements 
should be, "if legally possible, amended to reflect funding 
controls and risk management factors."
     However, the Navy will have to buck environmental 
regulators to avoid busting its budget plan, contended a 
briefing at a recent Navy environmental meeting.
     The plan calls for the Navy to spend $1.5 billion over the 
next five years, with 53% going to the Naval Facilities 
Engineering Command's West Coast organizations, 28% to 
NAVFAC's Atlantic Div., 12% to the Southern Div. and 7% 
to the Pacific Div.
     Last year NAVFAC field divisions arranged meetings 
with eight Environmental Protection Agency regions, 14 
states and Guam. In the meetings, the NAVFAC officials 
sought to reach a consensus on renegotiating cleanup 
agreements so the Navy can win regulatory approval without 
overspending.
     But the regulators declined to renegotiate, saying the 
Navy must start asking Congress for all the money it needs 
to protect human health and the environment. Typically, the 
Defense Dept.'s comptroller cuts service cleanup requests 
before they get to Congress.
     On the East Coast, EPA officials stressed the need for 
the Navy to tell Congress how much it really needs. They 
also questioned why so much of the spending is planned for 
the West Coast.
     On the West Coast, EPA officials flatly declined to 
negotiate extensions, and said the plan lacked enough money 
even for the priority projects.
     California and Washington refused to renegotiate. So did 
Florida, though other southern states said they might be 
willing to talk about it.
     "There will be ramifications" if the Navy adheres to its 
spending plan without renegotiating agreements, the briefing 
stated. The Navy is likely to attract heavy enforcement 
activity, including stipulated penalties, hazardous-waste 
orders, fines and penalties, lawsuits against the commanding 
officers of installations and citizen suits against the Navy and 
the environmental regulators.

Corps to incinerate Weldon Springs soil

     The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has 
allowed an Army incineration job in Missouri to proceed by 
freeing it from tough state permitting requirements.
     The Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City Dist. is 
closer to burning explosives-laced soil at the Army's 
Weldon Springs Ordnance Works, Mo., now that EPA 
Administrator Carol Browner has overruled state 
environmental regulators.
     The corps proposed to excavate approximately 30,000 
cubic yards of TNT and DNT contaminated soil and 
materials for incineration in a mobile on-site rotary kiln 
incinerator at a cost of $22 million to $27 million.
     Before the design contractor, IT Corp. of Irvine, Calif., 
could finish the 95% design phase of the Weldon Springs 
cleanup project, the Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources 
demanded the corps get a Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act (RCRA) permit. The corps wanted to proceed 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which doesn't 
require permits.
     Browner, who is the final arbiter of disputes among 
parties to the site's cleanup agreement, ruled that CERCLA 
should trump RCRA because the treatment will take place 
on a listed Superfund site. In such cases, the Superfund law 
requires projects to meet the substantive requirements of 
permits without actually getting the permits.
     The Weldon Springs Ordnance Works is divided into 
two main sites -- the ordnance works and the chemical plant 
area used by the Energy Dept. during the Cold War. DOE 
will cleanup its area separately.
     The Army is left to cleanup an area of soil contaminated 
with TNT and DNT covering more than 100 isolated 
locations. There is also a 16 mile-long contaminated wooden 
pipeline to be excavated and cleaned up.
     Under the corps' proposed plan, the Army will excavate 
and incinerate contaminated soil. The resulting ash, after 
sampling and testing, will be backfilled on site.
     Ash with high lead levels and soils contaminated with 
lead will be stabilized and placed in a hazardous waste 
landfill.
     Through an agreement between the Army and DOE, the 
Army will dispose of its waste in a DOE planned landfill 
which is expected to be built in 1998. In the meantime, the 
Army waste will be stored on-site.
     Although it would be easier to build the incinerator near 
the entrance to the ordnance works property, the Army, after 
receiving comments on its proposal, agreed to site the 
incinerator in a remote area away from residences and 
schools.
     The Army expects that the incinerator will be dismantled 
and removed as soon as the contaminated soil and wooden 
pipeline have been treated, the plan said.
     The corps is waiting to retrieve the money for the cleanup 
project from a general fund in its Formerly Used Defense 
Sites program before issuing a solicitation for the incinerator 
and soil excavation project. 
     Work at the site will include excavation, demolition, 
upgrading infrastructure and wood shredding.
     Tom Lorenz, the EPA project manager for the site, said a 
final decision to clean up the site will be signed in the next 
few months. After that, the corps has 15 months to begin 
remediation.
     For more information, call Tom Lorenz of the EPA at 
913-551-7292; Steve Iverson, project manager with the 
corps at 816-426-2671; or Chris Davidson with the state at 
314-751-3176.

Tooele locals press for emergency equipment

     Local officials are trying to prevent startup of the 
chemical weapons incinerator at Tooele Army Depot in Utah 
until they get enough money to deal with any accidental 
release of chemical agents.
     All three county commissioners and the heads of other 
agencies are asking the state to hold off on permitting trial 
burns to force the Army to come up with at least another $5 
million to complete their emergency response preparations.
     Officials say funding so far has been piecemeal, leaving 
the county with only a third of a communications system 
and no equipped and trained response team.
     "Our concern is that they're going to start incinerating 
weapons before we are ready," explains Tooele County 
Commissioner Lois McArthur.
     But the state solid and hazardous waste division says the 
trial burns are allowed under the original permit issued in 
1989, even though the Army still needs to submit 
modifications for division approval. The division considers 
emergency response a political issue outside its realm.
     Raymond Duda, a division staff engineer, says he can't 
understand why it's so important to have the emergency 
equipment now when the county has been living with the 
chemical arms for years. The depot has 42% of the nation's 
chemical weapons stockpile, much of it in 80-year-old 
containers that are getting leaky.
     County officials say national policy requires the 
community to be prepared and that the Army has not come 
forth to pay for it.
     "As I understand it, the county has an obligation to be 
prepared for anything that comes off base," says 
Commissioner McArthur. "If it's on base, the Army takes 
care of it."
     According to Kari Sagers, county emergency 
management director, the Army has provided about $8 
million since 1989, "a little bit at a time." In 1993, she says, 
the Army proposed spreading funding for the 
communications system over three years because of a tight 
budget, but the county got only the first year.
     "Now we have only a third of a communications system 
with sites but no generators," says Sagers.  "If we need to 
use a station we have to send somebody up with a portable 
unit."
     She estimates that between $5 million and $8 million is 
needed just for the rest of the critical items.
     Tooele County in western Utah is a sparsely populated 
area with about 18,000 residents in the town of Tooele 10 
miles from the incinerator site and about 8,000 in Grantsville 
20 miles away. Another 800 live in Rush Valley which is 
only a few miles from the site.

Group blasts Army over depleted uranium

     An environmental group this week urged the Army to 
stop using depleted uranium bullets and armor, and clean up 
what it has used, citing the Army's own environment, safety 
and health study.
     The Military Toxics Project based in Norway, Maine, 
obtained a copy of the study, a technical report by the Army 
Environmental Policy Institute in Atlanta, even though it 
said the Army refused to release it.
     The study analyzed the potential dangers of depleted 
uranium in the production, testing and fielding of weapon 
systems, focusing on the Operation Desert Storm battlefield.
     Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the nuclear weapons 
program's efforts to extract the fissile isotope U-235 from 
uranium ore for use in weapons. 
     The Army uses depleted uranium for tank destroying 
bullets because it's plentiful, it's twice as dense as lead, it 
catches fire when it hits, and it tends to fragment and 
ricochet or turn to dust after entering enemy tanks.
     The depleted uranium produces 0.4 microCuries/gram of 
radiation, about 60% of the 0.7 uC/g that emanates from 
uranium ore. Inhaled, it can lodge in the lungs, where its 
alpha radiation can slowly cause damage. Ingested, it 
concentrates in the kidneys, where it is toxic at low 
concentrations, as well as in the liver and bones.
     Uranium oxides are very water soluble and mobile in 
soil, although anaerobic conditions or decayed plant matter 
can stall them. Soil cleanup standards are 35 
picoCuries/gram  averaged over 100 square meters, and 100 
pCi/gram per square meter.
     The Army reported some remediation of depleted 
uranium bullets at domestic firing ranges. However, 
typically only half of the rounds fired are recovered at Yuma 
Proving Grounds, Ariz., and just 21% at more densely 
vegetated Jefferson Proving Grounds, Ind., and Aberdeen 
Proving Grounds, Md.
     Generally, the bullets, contaminated soil and other 
materials are handled as low-level radioactive waste and sent 
to Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensed sites for 
disposal.
     The report said the Army faces no requirement to remove 
the estimated 14,000 rounds of depleted uranium that litter 
Operation Desert Shield practice ranges in Saudi Arabia and 
the Desert Storm battlefield. "Remediation of battlefields is 
not historically the responsibility of the victor," the report 
said. "This task typically belongs to the indigenous 
population." Even so, the United States and its allies spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars removing unexploded 
ordnance and mines from the Desert Storm battlefield.
     The report appraised several cleanup technologies. It also 
urged the Army to pursue plans to recycle used depleted 
uranium bullets and related waste, as well as to promote the 
use of catch boxes on firing ranges. It also urged the Army 
to provide more funding for depleted uranium waste 
disposal. And it suggested the Army prepare a 
programmatic "life-cycle environmental document" or 
environmental impact statement to serve as an umbrella 
environmental planning document.
     The study's lead author was Stephen Shelton, a civil 
engineering professor with the University of New Mexico.

Hanford solicitation modified

     The Energy Dept.'s Richland (Wash.) Operations Office 
has modified its request for proposals for the Project 
Hanford Management Contract based on some 2,000 
comments to last year's draft RFP.
     The department took extra steps, it said, to make sure all 
offerors "have an equal opportunity to be selected even if 
they have no past DOE experience." For example, the 
technical and management criteria stress that it doesn't matter 
whether the contractor has worked at Hanford or any DOE 
site.
     DOE said it added a section on outcomes and success 
criteria after several commenters asked what DOE wants 
that's different from the "old way" of doing business.
     DOE said the statement of work was strengthened to 
define the site cleanup effort as a project, just as "in 
commercial project management." Other changes include 
more detail on the tank waste cleanup, on the relationships 
with other prime contractors, and on the transition period 
work scope.
     DOE reduced the infrastructure scope of work and 
recommended bidding it out on a fixed or fixed-unit price 
basis.
     The final RFP emphasizes cost reduction, including 
aggressive make-or-buy analysis.
     DOE plans to "privatize" treatment of high-level tank 
waste by paying a fee for treatment service to a contractor 
that raises its own capital to build the treatment facilities. 
However, the department is reserving the right, if it decides 
against privatizing, to ask the Hanford management 
contractor to handle the job instead.

Contractor roles detailed

     The Project Hanford Management Contractor is to 
assume its full duties by Oct. 1, 1996 -- six months before 
the March 31, 1997, expiration of the recently extended 
contract with incumbent Westinghouse Hanford Co.
     DOE said it plans to terminate the Westinghouse contract 
early, as well as direct Westinghouse to terminate its 
subcontracts with ICF Kaiser and Boeing Computer 
Services.
     Bechtel's cleanup contract will remain separate. It runs 
through 1999, with an option for three more years.
     DOE said MACTEC, its general support service 
contractor for the site, might face a conflict of interest if it's 
on a team that wins the contract.
     Every year, starting this Dec. 1, the contractor is to give 
DOE an "Advanced Acquisition Plan" that details the next 
two years of subcontracting plans.
     To keep major subcontracts on their toes, they are limited 
to two years with three option years.
     The standard industrial classification code is 8744, 
facilities support management services, with a small 
business size standard of $5 million average annual revenues 
or 500 employees.

Written proposals stressed

     Richland decided against the strictly oral proposal process 
used for the recent Savannah River re-compete, although 
oral presentations will have a role.
     A pre-proposal conference is set for Jan. 23, with site 
tours on Jan. 24 and 25.
     Written proposals are due March 15. Oral presentations 
will follow within a week. Selection will be based mainly on 
the written proposals, with the orals used to evaluate the 
technical knowledge, understanding, leadership, 
appropriateness and ability to work together of the offeror's 
key personnel.
     Offerors will propose three fee arrangements, assuming: 
they draw money as needed from the federal treasury via a 
letter-of-credit; they use their own money, then file invoices 
to get reimbursed every seven days; or they get reimbursed 
every 14 days.

DRMS offers cheap way to dispose of waste

     The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service wants 
your hazardous waste -- and is willing to accept the liabilities 
that go with it.
     DRMS, a defense agency headquartered in Battle Creek, 
Mich., wants the military services to come to it for disposal 
of hazardous waste from their installations.
     Paul Mank of DRMS told the American Defense 
Preparedness Assn.'s Hazardous Material and Waste 
Management conference in Alexandria, Va., this week that 
DRMS will dispose of hazardous waste at no cost to the 
customer and will take on all liabilities and fines associated 
with waste disposal.
     DRMS can remove hazardous waste pretty cheaply, too, 
Mank told the conference. DRMS disposal cost/lb. has 
declined 37% since 1992:

Fiscal year                    1992     1993     1994     1995
waste (in millions of lbs.)     247      285      350      332
cost (in million of dollars)   $128     $136     $137     $107
cost/lb                        $.51     $.44     $.39     $.32

     DRMS also takes on all liability involved in waste 
disposal, "keeping you out of trouble," Mank said. He said 
DRMS assumes liability for all actions under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
(CERCLA) -- even though CERCLA liability reaches waste 
generators, such as the installations that give DRMS their 
waste.
     "We spent $25 million on CERCLA cleanup costs alone 
in the late 1980s," Mank said, adding that DRMS takes care 
of all fines also.
     DRMS offers several basic services as well as some 
extras, Mank said.
     Basic services include: offering regional DOD contracts; 
waste-code pricing system; tracking/payment at disposal; 
Milsbills accounting; industry knowledge and contacts; and 
pricing for accelerated removals.
     Other work, such as tank and oil waste separator 
cleanups, waste characterization and recycling/reclamation, 
are extra services DRMS is doing on a more regular basis, 
Mank said.

DRMS contracts for disposal

     DRMS has long-term and short-term contracts with 
hazardous-waste companies to remove hazardous waste 
frequently enough so that installations don't have to get 
storage permits, said Thomas Wallenfang of DRMS' 
hazardous contracts division.
     DRMS has about 90 long-term RCRA contracts, 
including five for polychlorinated biphenyl waste and 
another five for compressed gas cylinders, as well as 
emergency contracts as needed.
     Long-term contracts are usually for 12 months to 18 
months with one- to three-year options, Wallenfang said. 
Each contract is tailored to each specific Defense Dept. 
customer, he added.
     Key DRMS contracting contacts for pre-award 
information are:
     ** DRMS (East) -- Ron Bayes, 616-961-7132
     ** DRMS (West) -- Barbara Heffner, 616-961-7136
     ** DRMS Chief - Tom Wallenfang, 616-961-7129
     Contacts for post-award information are:
     ** DRMS (East) - Ethel Carter, 614-962-6501
     ** DRMS (West) -- Ernie Bertagnolli, 801-399-7821
     ** DRMS Chief - Steve Sprague, 616-961-7107.

Remedial action contracts capacity remains

     The Naval Facilities Engineering Command still has 
plenty of contracting capacity -- more than $1.7 billion -- left 
in its remedial action contracts (RACs).
     The NAVFAC divisions and field activities awarded nine 
RACs worth more than $75 million. None of the bigger 
RACs have even come close to reaching contracting 
capacity. Only one has surpassed the $100 million mark.
     Eight other RACs were awarded in the early 1990s worth 
between $10 million and $40 million. NAVFAC officials in 
Port Hueneme, Calif., awarded these contracts in 1991 and 
1992 for specific contaminants such as polychlorinated 
biphenyl and petroleum, oil and lubricant waste. These 
contracts have been fully obligated.

Air Force looking for options

     The Air Force is looking for non-toxic, more efficient 
ways to deice its airfields and aircraft.
     Lt. Col. Robert Wallett, director of environment for the 
Air Force's civil engineer, told the American Defense 
Preparedness Assn. Hazardous Material and Waste 
Management conference in Alexandria, Va., this week that 
the Air Force needs alternatives to ethylene glycol and 
propylene glycol for deicing.
     The Air Force is prohibited from using ethylene glycol 
for deicing because of its toxicity, Wallett said. He added 
that propylene glycol, although widely used, isn't very 
effective.
     The Defense Dept. is required by executive order to 
reduce its toxic releases by 50% by 1999. 
     The Air Force is already making strides in that area, 
Wallett said.
     The Air Force has reduced its ozone depleting substances 
purchases by 78.1% over the past three years, Wallett told 
the conference. Its hazardous waste disposal numbers have 
also dropped by 33%, he added.
      Wallett said the Air Force is looking into alternatives to 
other toxic substances the services uses for daily activities. 
The major thrust areas include: cleaning and degreasing; 
plating and surface finishing; nonchrome conversion 
coating; paint stripping; painting and coating materials; 
painting and coating processes; fire suppression; elimination 
of toxic materials; hazardous and toxic wastes; and volatile 
organic compounds.
     The Wright Laboratory in Ohio is performing research in 
these and other areas, Wallett said, adding that industry 
support is needed.

IG describes recent findings

     The Energy Dept.'s inspector general has issued a 
summary of its audits, inspections and investigations 
completed in the six months ending Sept. 30, 1995. Here are 
highlights of reports not previously digested in Defense 
Cleanup.
     ** An M&O contractor used only $1.6 million of the 
$8.4 million DOE Dept. had approved for merit pay 
increases. DOE gives this contractor incentives for reducing 
costs, but shouldn't for withholding pay, the IG said (No. 
S93IS046).
     ** DOE suspended a small, disadvantaged business 
from its vendor list after an IG investigation. The 
investigation followed a complaint that a procurement 
official with an M&O contractor was steering business to 
the company employing his wife.
     The IG found the contractor had given the company 
$594,000 of work, and the M&O contracting officer had 
requested 226 orders for additional purchases to be awarded 
the company. The official said he and his wife had been 
friends with the company's owner for 10 years (No. 
I92OR002).
     ** IG investigators found invoices showing a DOE 
subcontractor employee had sold 10.5 tons of DOE's copper 
pipe to a scrap dealer for more than $25,000 in cash.
     In subsequent investigations, the IG found the employee 
and two others had been removing truckloads of copper pipe 
and fittings from a salvage area.
     The subcontractor, which was demolishing the K-25 
cooling tower at DOE's Oak Ridge, Tenn., site, suspended 
the workers.
      DOE agreed with IG recommendations to: add 
procedures to prevent such thefts; survey all recovered 
metals for radiation; recoup $19,000 from the subcontractor; 
and hold the prime contractor more accountable (No. 
I95OR029).
     The IG also issued a number of audit reports during the 
six months ending Sept. 30, 1995. Here are two highlights:
     ** The IG questioned $1.59 million of costs incurred by 
Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp. 
during cleanup of DOE's Fernald, Ohio, site from Sept. 1, 
1992, to Sept. 30, 1993 (No. ER-C-95-03).
     ** On June 16, 1995, the IG reviewed the status of 
efforts to improve management information systems for 
environmental compliance activities (No. CR-L-95-21).
     Call 202-586-2744 to leave voice-mail requests for 
reports, or fax requests to 202-586-3636. Be sure to give the 
report number. For more information, call Wilma Slaughter, 
202-586-1924.

DOE drafts Mound offer

     Next week, the Energy Dept.'s Miamisburg (Ohio) Area 
Office plans to announce a draft request for proposals for a 
contract to phase out operations and clean up the 
department's Mound Plant in Miamisburg.
     The announcement will appear in the Commerce 
Business Daily.
     Contractors have grown increasingly interested in this 
procurement. One source said the major players include ICF 
Kaiser, Teledyne Brown, Morrison Knudsen, Jacobs 
Engineering Group, OHM, Parsons, Fluor and Babcock & 
Wilcox.
     EG&G Mound Applied Technologies told DOE last 
May it would not pursue a planned two-year extension of its 
contract to run the site, which expires this Sept. 30.
     DOE officials realized they needed to act quickly to hire a 
successor, but first they had to develop a contracting strategy 
and address stakeholder concerns. The department is 
considering exercising a contract clause allowing it to 
unilaterally extend EG&G's contract by a year while it 
proceeds with the procurement (Defense Cleanup, 6/2/95, 
10/20/95, 11/17/95).
     DOE has developed a plan to accelerate the site's cleanup 
by spending less money faster. DOE plans to close out the 
site in 13 years for just $1.1 billion instead of taking 30 
years and $2.2 billion (Defense Cleanup, 6/2/95).
     The contacts for the draft RFP are Barry Kain, 513-865-
3843, and Erma Brown, 513-865-3030.

Army spurned sludge burning

     The Army incinerated liquids from the Rocky Mountain 
Arsenal's Basin F, not sludge as reported in the Dec. 15, 
1995, issue of Defense Cleanup.
     The Army gathered the Denver site's Basin F sludge into 
a waste pile and capped it. Later, the Environmental 
Protection Agency urged the Army to thermally desorb 
contamination from the piled sludge and incinerate the off-
gas. However, the Army instead has proposed to landfill the 
material (Defense Cleanup, 11/17/95).

Kaho'olawe effort delayed

     Difficulties coordinating all the players have delayed the 
solicitation for cleanup of Kaho'olawe Island in Hawaii.
     The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Div. 
expected to issue a draft solicitation last Nov. 30. Now the 
draft isn't likely to hit the streets until late this month or early 
next.
     Last year, the Navy transferred the island to the state. 
However, the Navy, which used the island as a bombing 
range for 50 years, must now restore it. But that involves 
coordinating several Navy organizations, state officials, 
representatives of native Hawaiians, the Air Force and the 
Army Corps of Engineers.

Hanford improvements touted

     The Energy Dept. says contract reform is making a big 
difference at Westinghouse Hanford Co.'s Solid Waste 
Disposal Div.
     A year ago, DOE subjected the Hanford, Wash., 
operation to a new contract that contains no award fee, sets 
specific objectives, and has penalties for missing them. The 
division has since cut costs by nearly $20 million, while 
beating deadlines and safety goals.
     Meanwhile, long-range, cost-cutting efforts have reduced 
disposal costs from $80/cubic foot of low-level waste in 
1992 to $20.
     And the average time to process waste acceptance papers 
is down from 60 days to six.

Navy buys equipment

     The Navy is running a headquarters-level program to buy 
pollution prevention equipment.
     David Asiello, the Pollution Prevention Branch chief in 
the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, prepared a 
presentation about the program to a meeting of Navy 
environmental managers. However, the Nov. 14-16 meeting 
in San Diego was cut short by a federal furlough.
     The Navy created the centrally managed and funded 
effort to meet new pollution prevention requirements from 
executive orders 12856 and 12873. Procurement is through 
the Naval Air Warfare Center in Lakehurst, N.J., and the 
Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center in Port 
Hueneme, Calif.
     Here's the funding profile in millions of dollars:

Procurement     FY94     FY95     FY96     FY97
Programmed       1.9     19.0     13.8     19.1
Obligated        1.9     16.9     0.0     0.0

     This year the Lakehurst center plans to buy aqueous parts 
washers, a hydraulic purifier, a particle counter, glovebox 
plastic media blasters, paint gun washers, a 55-gallon drum 
crusher, a halon 1301 recycling unit and a glycol recycler.
     The Port Hueneme center plans to buy 23 items, 
including a mobile reuse center, a solvent still, a sludge 
dewatering system, a vacuum blast machine, a dry ice 
blasting unit, a closed loop wash rack, an oil recovery unit, 
an oil filter sensor and a portable sand blasting recycler.
     The effort is run by a steering committee chaired by 
Asiello, 703-602-5334, and Dan Glass, 703-602-4497. 
Procurement contacts are Jill MacIntyre at Lakehurst, 808-
323-1108, and Rick Gardner at Port Hueneme, 805-982-
3686. The committee includes representatives of each of the 
Navy's major commands.

Envirocare wins permit

     The Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality's Solid and 
Hazardous Waste Div. has issued a permit to Envirocare of 
Utah Inc. for macroencapsulation of mixed radioactive and 
hazardous waste at its Clive, Utah, treatment plant.
     The Energy Dept. gave Envirocare $1 million under a 
cooperative research and development agreement to try 
using its MACRO-LOC treatment process along with a 
polyethylene encapsulation technology developed by DOE's 
Brookhaven National Laboratory.
     The process takes plastic waste and extrudes polyethylene 
from it to seal slightly radioactive lead.
