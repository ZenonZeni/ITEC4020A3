Title: THE BIRDS<br>
Author: Gregg Easterbrook<br>
<hr>
    Environmentalists hold that even if many spotted owl thrive in
California, logging bans must continue in Washington and Oregon because owl
populations there are locally distinct; the birds roost in cool climates
feeding on arboreal squirrels, a "distinct" Northwest delicacy. This is
probably an accurate reading of the Endangered Species Act as written, but it
points to a deep logical fault in environmental orthodoxy. If local variations
in climate and diet convert creatures to different species, a black man who
lives in Seattle, gets rained on and eats salmon would be a different species
from a white man who lives in stifling humidity in Louisiana and dines on
gumbo. By this theory the human race contains hundreds of species. The sort of
people likely to be environmentalists maintain that when it comes to genus
homo, all individuals of all origins are exactly the same in genetic heritage.
Yet when it comes to animals, the tiniest distinction renders apparently
identical living things irrevocably separate species. The typical northern and
California spotted owls look and act more alike than the typical black
American and white African. But according to politically correct dogma,
different people are identical while similar birds are drastically different.
