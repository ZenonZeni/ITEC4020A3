NGVS TOUTED AS SOLUTION TO FOREIGN OIL DEPENDENCE .

A report
from the National Defense Council Foundation (NDCF) claims that increased use
of domestic natural gas for transportation is a viable alternative to what the
Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) calls "America's increasing dependence on
foreign oil." The study, Natural Gas Vehicles: Helping Ensure America's Energy
Security, predicts that efforts to place two million NGVs on U.S. roads would
create tens of thousands of new jobs and save billions of dollars in fuel costs
for the United States. Additionally, the study forecasts such an effort would
reduce America's balance of trade by $7.3 billion and U.S. oil imports by at
least 2.2%.  The report cites government projections indicating that nearly 75%
of U.S. oil consumption will be foreign-sourced by the year 2010. Furthermore,
study authors project the unthinkable   that the U.S. Department of Defense may
eventually be forced into using foreign oil. "Should this occur, U.S. forces
would be left hostage to the good will of foreign suppliers for one of their
most essential military supplies." "The findings of this report clearly
demonstrate the merits of incentive-oriented government initiatives to advance
the use of natural gas and natural gas vehicles," says NGVC chairman Warren
Mitchell.  National Defense Council Foundation, 1220 King St., Alexandria, Va.,

AFVS MAKING INROADS IN ATLANTA FLEETS .

Advocates of alternative fuels should be
pleased with a recently released, federally-sponsored survey of Atlanta, Ga.
fleets, which indicates an increasing interest in ethanol, methanol, natural
gas, propane, and electricity.  Nine percent of local government fleets in 1994
included vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel, while 1%
of private company fleets included alternative-fuel vehicles. Twenty percent of
municipal fleet managers had plans to purchase or convert vehicles to use
alternative fuels during 1995 and 3% of private company fleets reported AFV
plans for the year.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration survey of
102,140 private companies and local government agencies in the city shows that
alternative-fueled vehicles comprised 1% of all fleets, compared to 69% of the
vehicles using gasoline and 30% using diesel fuel. Viewed by fleet ownership,
the fuel distribution ratio shows private fleets consisted of 70% gasoline
vehicles, 29% diesel-fueled vehicles and 1% AFVs, while municipal fleets had
63% of their vehicles running on gasoline, 36% on diesel, and 1% on alternative
fuels.  Private company fleets included an estimated 83,000 conventional fuel
vehicles with light-duty vehicles making up almost 70% of the total. Of nearly
19,000 gasoline and diesel fuel vehicles in municipal fleets, 60% were light-
duty vehicles.  How far fleet vehicles need to travel before refueling was of
interest in this survey because AFVs tend to offer shorter ranges than
conventionally-fueled vehicles, EIA says. One measure of required fleet vehicle
range is average daily mileage. The survey found that one-third of private
fleet vehicles travel less than 100 miles per day.  Also, centrally-fueled
fleets may find it easier to supply alternative fuel on-site. Eight-five
percent of local government fleets with gasoline vehicles and 80% of those with
diesel vehicles fueled them at a central government-owned site. Ten percent of
private fleets with gasoline vehicles and 20% with diesel vehicles fueled them
on-site.  The survey was designed to draw a profile of private and local
government fleets in a major metropolitan area and gauge the effectiveness of
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which were
expected to boost AFV purchases for use in fleets. The survey site, Atlanta,
was the first metropolitan area designated a "Clean City" by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A second "clean city," Denver, Colo., was the site of a
recently-completed follow-up survey.  Copies of "Profile of Motor Vehicle
Fleets in Atlanta 1994, DOE/EIA-0601," are available from the EIA's National
Energy Information Center, Room 1F-048, Forrestal Bldg., Washington, D.C.

TRANSCOM NGV SYSTEM TO BE USED IN HUNGARY.

TheHungarian government intends to implement a modified version of a natural
gas vehicle electronic control system developed for heavy-duty NGV engines by
Transcom Gas Technologies Pty Ltd. (Herdsman, Australia). Hungary will use its
BKV bus fleet pending a government feasibility study of the process. The World
Bank and the Hungarian Ministry for the Environment's Special Fund are expected
to pay for installation of the system in an initial 300 BKV buses.  Transcom
has applied its fuel-injected natural gas system to a RABA engine that's
scheduled to undergo on-road testing in Hungary. A second RABA engine featuring
the NGV system is being completed for use by Transcom as a showcase in Europe
to demonstrate high-performance levels and low emissions.  The government of
Western Australia has recognized Transcom's technology by awarding a contract
to convert 100 Perth commuter buses to run on compressed natural gas. The $2.2
million ($A3 million) program to retrofit the Renault buses with the Transcom
system follows extensive trials.  Transcom's electronically-controlled,
multipoint NGV fuel-injection system was developed at a cost of $8 million,
with a further $2 million budgeted for this year.

SOTEREM'S HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE UNDERGOES FLEET TESTING IN
FRANCE.

A small
French aerospace firm, Soterem, is participating in a major field test of
electric vehicles being conducted by the French automaker Renault in the
southwestern city of Toulouse.  With an eye toward building fleets of electric
vehicles to be made available as rentals to the public, Renault is currently
testing a dozen EV prototypes, some supplied by local equipment suppliers.
Soterem's electric Vetela is one of these.  The 3-door, 2-passenger Vetela is a
hybrid electric vehicle based on the all-wheel drive Citroen AX. Built under
contract to the French Ministry of Research and Higher Education, Soterem's
developmental Vetela replaces the Citroen's rear axle assembly with an air-
cooled 15 kW AC electric motor; a water-cooled variant will be used in newer
prototypes. Speed reduction gearing and a single-speed transmission transfer
power to the wheels.  Power is supplied by 15 Oldham 12-volt, 36 amp-hour
sealed lead-acid batteries. A front-mounted 1.4-liter internal combustion
engine fueled by a 11.3-gallon gasoline tank also produces electricity to power
the car's electric motor for extended travel, or motivates the car via
conventional IC power only. Electric-only range is a claimed 19 miles, with a
354 mile range provided via hybrid electric propulsion.  Acceleration is
reported to be about average with a 0-60 mph sprint accomplished in 11.4
seconds in hybrid mode. Electric-only acceleration is a sluggish 0-30 mph in 22
seconds. A top speed of 103 mph is claimed.  Importantly, the French
engineering company has achieved its electric hybrid transformation with a very
manageable weight penalty, a claim that can't always be made by electric
vehicle upfitters. The Vetela electric hybrid weighs in at just 440 pounds more
than the standard Citroen AX on which it's based.  Soterem is currently seeking
partnership contracts with local governments and fleets to facilitate building
newer and more advanced prototypes.  Soterem, Z.I. Vic, B.P. 97, 312322

ELECTRIC BICYCLES TOSELL AT AUTO AND BIKE OUTLETS.

With world bicycle ownership totaling over the
one billion mark, it's no wonder that electric vehicle interests are beginning
to show substantial interest in this market. One of these, ZAP Power Systems
(Sebastopol, Calif.), is presently using a $25,000 contract award from the
California Energy Commission's International Energy Fund to stimulate foreign
trade and business opportunities for its electric bicycles. The firm previously
received $20,000 in funding from the National Association of State Development
Agencies and the U.S. Asia Environmental Partnership that reportedly helped
generate $200,000 in revenues. Additional funding from the Electric Power
Research Institute allowed conducting a nationwide electric bicycle
demonstration project through utilities and police departments in the U.S.  ZAP
markets a kit that converts nearly any bicycle into an electric bike. The firm
also sells its PowerBike and PowerTrike models with the ZAP system already
installed. The PowerBike is propelled with dual DC motors mounted over its rear
wheel, a 17 amp-hour, maintenance-free lead-acid battery positioned beneath the
crossbar, and a three-speed controller. Optional are a 33 amp-hour battery, a
headlight, and a speedometer.  A six-amp charger is also provided.  Two other
firms, the Electric Bicycle Company (EBC) and BAT International are also
anticipating a significant worldwide demand for electric bicycles. EBC recently
introduced its EV Warrior line, a five-speed bicycle with a 12-volt battery
pack mounted over the rear wheel. The bicycles retail for $900 to $1500 and are
being sold through automobile dealers.  The firm was formed by Malcolm Currie,
a former chief executive at both Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics who also
served as U.S. Undersecretary of Defense, and Malcolm Bricklin, founder of
Subaru of America and Yugo of America.  The company has received $5 million in
funding from an investor in Asia.  Unlike EBC, BAT plans to market its
Electrobike through bicycle stores. The Electrobike uses a direct-drive, geared
transmission and a cartridge battery pack which the company says can be changed
in 30 seconds.

ON THE VALUE OF THE ZEV AS A POLLUTION CONTROL STRATEGY:.

"The zero-
emission vehicle concept represents a breakthrough for air quality protection.
It holds the promise not only of reducing pollution as other vehicles are
replaced, but also would make it possible for continuing population growth to
occur without additional mobile source pollution. For the near term, the zero-
emission vehicle would also make it possible for the relative pollution control
burden on stationary sources to stabilize."   James M.  Strock, Secretary for
Environmental Protection, State of California

MEXICO CITY'S SMOG PLAN CALLED A FAILURE.

A study by Mexico City's
Metropolitan Commission for Pollution Control and Prevention concludes that a
six-year old plan to control pollution has not curbed the city's infamous smog
problems. Key to the plan is a law that bans certain vehicles from the road on
designated days between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m., based on the last digit of the
car's license plate.  According to the study, gasoline consumption in the area
around Mexico City has increased by about a half-million gallons per day over
the past six years. Furthermore, air pollution in the city is said to be at its
worst level.  The problem is said to be exacerbated by the law. To avoid the
rule, some drivers have purchased additional vehicles, driving them when their
primary car cannot be used. To make matters worse, these purchases have
contributed to the 50 percent increase of vehicles on the road since the law
took effect.  Mexico City's environmental commission plans to maintain the rule
until new ones can be passed. Possible plans include incentives for installing
catalytic converters, which currently are not required in Mexico.

GM SETTLES CADILLAC EMISSIONS CASE WITH EPA.

General Motors has agreed to spend about $45
million to settle U.S. Environmental Protection Agency charges that it
installed illegal computer chips that allowed 470,000 Cadillacs made since 1991
to defeat federally-required emissions controls. Those cars now produce up to
three times the legal limit of carbon monoxide.  In settling the case, the
largest ever brought by the Justice Department under the Clean Air Act, GM
agreed to pay an $11 million fine, spend more than $25 million to recall and
retrofit the polluting vehicles, and spend up to $8.75 million on emission-
offset projects such as buying back older vehicles or purchasing new school
buses that burn cleaner fuels.  The case began with an EPA investigation that
showed the Cadillac "defeat devices" resulted in illegal emissions of about
100,000 tons of excess carbon monoxide pollution. The agreement, filed in
federal District Court in Washington, D.C., resolved government allegations
that GM sold vehicles that did not conform to CAA rules, made and sold vehicles
equipped with illegal defeat devices, tampered with certain 1991 and 1992
model-year Cadillacs, and failed to describe the use of emission-control
devices to EPA.  The allegations centered on GM's 1991-1995 model year
Cadillacs, including Seville and Deville models equipped with 4.9-liter
engines. An additional claim involved GM's failure to notify EPA about certain
emission control strategies for light-duty vehicles sold in model years 1991-
1995.  During routine testing in fall 1993, EPA discovered that the Cadillacs
failed to comply with federal emissions requirements. EPA tests showed that the
engines emitted up to 10 grams of CO per mile with the climate control on
well above the 3.4 gram/mile limit. In 1990, GM designed a new engine control
computer chip to respond to customer complaints of stalling and other drive
problems in the 1991 Cadillacs.  The device nearly tripled the output of CO
when the car's heater or air conditioner was turned on. The instructions on the
computer chip enriched the fuel/air ratio, which overrode the emissions control
system and resulted in the higher pollution. For the 1993-1995 models, GM again
failed to disclose the use of the device or its effects on emissions, the
Justice Department said.  "Carbon monoxide can cause cardiopulmonary problems
and can lead to headaches, impaired vision, and a reduced ability to work and
learn," says Attorney General Janet Reno. "These so-called defeat devices are
not just paper violations, but result in real increases in emissions that
affect real people." Adds U.S. EPA Administrator Carol Browner: "These illegal
devices caused enough additional air pollution to blanket a major U.S. city,
such as Washington, D.C., with a 10-foot layer of CO." Because the vehicle
certification program relies on complete and accurate information from
automobile manufacturers, "GM's conduct jeopardized the integrity of the
program," says assistant EPA administrator for air enforcement and compliance
assurance Steven Harman.

U.S. DOE REQUESTS REAUTHORIZATION OF AFV PROGRAM.

A top
U.S. Department of Energy official has formally asked Congress to reauthorize
programs aimed at boosting alternative-fuel use for heavy-duty vehicles.  The
Alternative-Fuels Truck Commercial Application Program, which a House panel is
reviewing for reauthorization under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
(EPCA), contributes substantial value toward advancement of alternative fuel
transportation technologies necessary to meet EPCA goals, says C. Kyle Simpson,
DOE's associate deputy secretary for Energy Programs. The program's purpose is
to reduce U.S.  reliance on imported oil and lessen the environmental impacts
of energy use in transportation. Simpson addressed the Commerce Committee's
Subcommittee on Energy and Power last month.  The program develops and
implements demonstrations of heavy-duty vehicles using field-test engines
operating on alternative fuels. The goal is to move heavy-duty alternative fuel
engine technology toward commercialization and widen awareness and acceptance
of alternative fuels in heavy-duty applications. In addition, as commercial
technology becomes available, the program will evaluate the performance, cost,
and emissions of AFVs compared to conventional diesel and gasoline vehicles.
Under the program, DOE is cooperating with municipalities, state and local
governments, other federal agencies, and private fleet operators to test the
real-life operation of vehicles running on alternative fuels. The program tests
trucks running on methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas, biodiesel, and
propane. Because heavy-duty trucks typically are very expensive, the cost of
test vehicles is shared with private fleet owners or state or local
governments.  The program consists of more than 350 alternative-fuel, heavy-
duty vehicles and 40 control vehicles. These vehicles are located in 26 states
and include local delivery trucks, line haul trucks, garbage packers, dump
trucks, snow plows, airport shuttles, street sweepers, and school buses.  John
Nunley, representing the National Association of State Energy Officials,
recommended continued support of Georgia Division of Energy Resources' AFV
program, which uses DOE funds to encourage local governments and authorities to
convert to alternative fuel sources. Investments of $400,000 in public funds
have leveraged over $1.8 million used in converting approximately 350 public
vehicles.

MANAGING CANADA'S EV R&D PROJECTS.

In order to keep Canada's electric
vehicle technology efforts on track, the Electric Vehicle Association of Canada
(EVAC) has launched a program to coordinate this country's pre-competitive EV
research and development projects.  Its aim is to enable Canadian corporations,
governments, and even U.S. and other non-Canadian corporations to pool money
for specific research projects or for development of EV components and systems.
The program is expected to enhance Canada's involvement in EVs in several ways.
Among them: Facilitating pre-competitive research among competing corporations
and helping to create industrial alliances for the joint-venture development of
products that will benefit Canadian and provincial economies.  Increasing
Canada's expertise in EV research and development is also considered a likely
result, as is the creation of spin-off companies with viable marketable
products for the electric vehicle field.  The program is expected to provide
the government with a better structure for selecting programs for matching
funds. The decision on which projects to sponsor will be 100% market-driven,
says Bill Adams, EVAC R&D Committee chairman and president of ESTCO Energy,
Inc. He adds that corporate sponsors must also be willing to fund a minimum of
50% of a project's cost in order to be considered for matching funding from the
government.  EVAC, Suite 11, Concourse Gate, Nepean, Ont. K2F 7S4 Canada; phone

POLLUTANT MAY BE CLEAN FUEL OF THE FUTURE.

German researchers believe
the pollutant carbon dioxide can be retrieved from the atmosphere, recycled
through solar-energy hydrogen into methanol, and become the cheap, clean fuel
of the future. Scientists at Stuttgart's Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen
Research (ZSW) are confident that their project will be successful.  Not only
is CO2 recyclable, they say, but the process also would reduce air pollution by
shrinking the amount of that greenhouse gas in the air. Furthermore, the
process can be a virtual closed-loop operation: When methanol is burned as a
fuel it releases CO2, which once again can be captured and recycled.  The
process is a chemical reaction with hydrogen gained through solar energy, which
converts CO2 into methanol. By mid-1996 ZSW will have constructed a pump in
Stuttgart to carry out this conversion into methanol. The commercial aspect is
particularly attractive, proponents say. Not only will the fuel be cheap to
produce, but under present German law it will be tax-free, unlike heavily-taxed
gasoline and diesel.

REPAIR AND RECYCLING OF AUTOMOTIVE PLASTICS.

The American Plastics
Council is making available summary research conducted on the repair and reuse
of plastic automotive parts, the economics of recovery and recycling, disposal
practices for post-use automotive plastics, and sorting and processing
automotive plastics. The reports are part of a seven-part series.  Repair and
Reuse of Automotive Plastic Parts concludes that automobile bumpers are the
most repaired component due to strong markets, ease of repair, and availability
of repair techniques. However, many technicians avoid repair of plastic
components because such work is not competitive with the cost of a new part.
The report also notes that the Inter-Industry Council on Automotive Repair and
the Automotive Recyclers Association can play "pivotal" roles in increasing the
quantity of plastic parts recovered and the amount of plastic reused. Disposal
Practices for Post-Use Automotive Plastics outlines current disposal practices
for dismantlers, wreckers, shredders, nonferrous-metal separators, repair
shops, processors, and component suppliers and tracks automotive plastics
through these shops to landfills. The report also finds that polypropylene (PP)
from automotive battery cases is the only automotive plastic component
commercially recycled. After recovery of the lead used in batteries, more than
100 million pounds of PP from battery cases is reclaimed annually.  Economics
of Recovery and Recycling discusses development of an economic model for the
commercial infrastructure required for recovering plastics from the 10 million
vehicles junked annually in the U.S.  Sorting and Processing Automotive
Plastics - Emerging Technologies concludes that creating a U.S. industry which
recycles significant quantities of automotive polymers from scrap vehicles
"will require a tremendous technological effort." Also, the report points out
that new businesses for collection and processing need to be created before
significant recycling of automotive polymers takes place.  Fact sheets are
available free-of-charge from the American Plastics Council, phone 800.243.5790

JAPANESE UTILITY LAUNCHES NGV REFUELING UNIT.

Sanyo Electric Co.
Ltd., a Japanese utility, has announced the production of small natural gas
refueling units for compressed natural gas vehicles (NGVs). The refueling
appliance is capable of filling a 12.5 gallon gaseous fuel tank in less than 2
1/2 hours.  Targeted will be domestic home users and urban transportation
companies. The export market also appeals to Sanyo, which has its eye on
Southeast Asian countries where natural gas is widely available. Sales are
expected to commence imminently.  The Japanese government reportedly plans to
encourage the growth of NGVs on that nation's highways to as many as 200,000
units by the year 2000, spending some $19 million (2 billion yen) in
implementing its program.

LNG SEEN AS OPTIMAL FOR SOME AIRPORT VEHICLES.

While compressed
natural gas could best meet the needs of smaller vehicles at an airport,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) "would be the fuel of choice for buses and large
vehicles," says Lloyd W. Klefstad, Construction and Maintenance Bureau chief at
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  "The Department of Airports wants to
be a good neighbor to our surrounding communities, and one way is to help
reduce emissions in and around [LAX]," adds Klefstad. "LAX is certainly a
leader in incorporating low-emissions vehicles into our fleet." A fleet of 677
vehicles including light-duty trucks, 56 parking-lot shuttle buses, and 17
airfield buses is currently in use at the airport. This creates quite a
potential for integration of alternative fuels into the mix. An average of
65,000 vehicles travel to and from LAX daily.  Several federal and state
legislative and administrative actions affect the operation of these vehicles,
Klefstad points out. In its effort to be responsive to environmental concerns,
the board of airport commissioners is addressing the air-quality problems in
the Los Angeles Basin. After conducting a comprehensive evaluation in 1990 of
alternative fuels for the fleet, the Department of Airports concluded that no
one fuel best meets its requirements.  A year later, based on the department's
research and experience, it was determined that propane or CNG would be best
for buses and large vehicles. However, further study pointed to CNG alone as
best for many of the vehicles.  Following two years of additional
investigations into costs, maintenance, training, facility requirements, air-
quality impacts and safety of CNG and propane vehicles, the department
concluded that LNG would be appropriate for buses and larger vehicles due to
weight considerations and range. For shuttle service the airport uses a
transit-type bus with seating and standing capacity for 40 passengers and their
luggage.  Airfield buses are 130-passenger diesel people-movers.  To date, LAX
has replaced 14 diesel transit buses one-for-one with LNG models and has eight
more on order. The buses have an L10-240G Cummins engine and are outfitted with
a 145-gallon MVE fuel tank and a saturated-type fueling system, providing a
usable 125 gallons of fuel. An initial computerized fleet-maintenance
comparison shows the diesel buses average 3.5 miles per gallon compared to 1.5-
1.8 mpg for the LNG buses, which receive 50-60 gallons of the less expensive
LNG in daily refueling.  As the LNG buses were broken in and operations further
modified, efficiency rose to a fleet average of 1.95 mpg.  Southern California
Gas Co., the fuel provider, selected Cryenco to build the station, which
consists of two 5,300-gallon fuel tanks on skids, plus plumbing and pumps. The
department has issued a solicitation for a permanent station, scheduled to be
in operation within a year. The new station also will fuel CNG vehicles and
other equipment, and serve other agencies, airport tenants, airlines, and the
public.  The department plans to replace its remaining 42 diesel buses and 17
airfield buses with LNG models over the next several years. This year, the
agency will seek bids on six transit buses and a similar number of airfield
buses, with an option for six additional airfield buses.  Meanwhile, the
department is evaluating its other large vehicles as candidates for LNG
variants on a replacement basis and is negotiating to purchase a Class 7 or 8
truck-tractor. Sedans and pickups also are being replaced with CNG vehicles,
and to date 30 pickup trucks and three sedans have been converted to this
gaseous fuel. Beyond that, the department is involved in a hybrid bus project
that will use a constant-speed, LNG-fueled turbine engine driving an electric
generator to power electric traction motors.

FIAT, ROVER TEAM IN VEHICLE RECYCLING.

Agreement Fiat Auto and Rover
Group will collect and treat discarded cars within each manufacturer's
recycling program in Italy and Britain under a cooperative agreement the firms
recently penned.  Fiat's auto-recycling project (F.A.RE) is a closed-loop
recycling system with outlets for reuse determined in advance. The program aims
to create no pollution or waste and use resources optimally via innovative
design and production methods. Fiat says its "design for recycling" assures
maximum recyclability, while its "design for dismantling" reduces the cost of
disassembly and reflects the future-oriented philosophy behind F.A.RE.  F.A.RE
already has spread throughout France and Germany via accords with Renault and
BMW. Launched in 1992 in northern Italy, F.A.RE has expanded to 80 plants
nationwide with 20 more planned by year's end. These facilities are associated
with the National Association of Car Dismantlers.  The plants separate glass,
plastic, and seat padding, which are then collected by other companies
participating in the F.A.RE program. The materials are transformed into new
components for the car market and other industrial sectors. More than 100,000
cars have gone through the recycling process, resulting in about 3,200 tons of
recycled non-metallic materials and more than 69,000 tons of metals since 1992.
Nearly 1,900 tons of glass have helped produce 3 million bottles, while 580
tons of plastic bumper material has reemerged in the form of more than 230,000
air channels for the Tipo and Punto models. Additionally, about 746 tons of
seat padding has contributed to 825,000 square meters of carpeting.

NOx REDUCTION OF ENGINE EXHAUST WITHOUT ADDING REDUCING AGENT DE
4319294 C.

Reduction of NOx in engine exhaust gas involves adsorption of NOx in an
adsorber in the exhaust pipe, periodic desorption with a hot gas and then
reaction to N2 and O2.  The novelty is that the NOx is mixed with the suction
air for reaction in the combustion chamber of the engine.  NOx is adsorbed and
desorbed alternately in two parallel adsorbers. The hot gas from the adsorber
can be used for desorption. For a compression engine with a catalyst in the
exhaust pipe, excess air is used in the adsorption phase and a stoichiometric
mixture for the desorption phase and a small amount of the exhaust gas stream
is passed to the adsorber in the desorption phase, while the rest passes
directly to the catalyst.  USE/ADVANTAGE: NOx is reduced without using added
reducing agent and the entire operation is confined to the engine.

FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR IC ENGINE NL 191373 B.

System controls the fuel-to-air
mixture of an internal combustion engine which uses several different types of
fuel. It adjusts the mixture according to the relative proportions of different
hydrocarbons in the fuel. The incoming fuel is heated by the vehicle engine's
cooling water. The output pipe from the heat exchanger is monitored by a
temperature sensor.  The refractive index of the heated fuel is then detected
by an opto-electronic transducer. The two sensor outputs are fed to an
electronic controller circuit. A controller output is used to switch the
cooling water flow on or off, so that a preset temperature range is maintained.
Another controller output operates a servo motor. The servo motor controls the
fuel-to-air mixture via a Bowden cable.  USE/ADVANTAGE: Enables a variety of
fuels to be used with the same engine, but without any manual adjustment of the
carburetor.

FUEL INJECTED IC ENGINE METHOD GB 2279994 A .

Each engine combustion chamber is
connected by way of a respective non-return valve to a common pressure
reservoir and a pressure regulator provides gas at a regulated pressure to the
fuel injection system via an outlet pipe. The regulated pressure may be varied
by changing the force of the spring, varying the pressure in the spring
chamber, or by an electrical signal to a regulator electromagnet.  The engine
itself acts as the compressor in that the pressure in the combustion chamber is
supplied to the pressure reservoir through the non-return valves. After the
first few strokes, the pressure reservoir attains peak pressure and after that
volume of gas is consumed it's drawn by the fuel injection system.
USE/ADVANTAGE: Provides convenient and inexpensive supply of compressed gas.
Gas used by fuel injection is contained in a closed circuit, not interfering
with engine idling speed control.
