<P>
The CRC for Viticulture will extend Australia's lead in international grape production and processing technology by focusing the nation’s collective research, extension and education efforts in viticulture. The centre aims to produce higher quality, more efficiently grown and contaminant-free grapes for all purposes.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Research resources are concentrated in areas where the greatest technological and economic gains can be made. Findings are disseminated and taken up within the commercial grape growing industry. Current projects aim to:
<UL>
<LI>Improve grapes and grape products through biotechnology. This involves the development of molecular techniques for identifying grapevine varieties, clones and economically important grapevine pathogens and pests, and the use of molecular methods for genetically transforming grapevines and wine yeasts.
<LI>Establish optimal viticultural systems through the development of strategic vine management systems which are climate sensitive. These will enable vineyard managers to reduce inputs, particularly agrochemicals, without any reduction in grape quality.
<LI>Establish systems for the characterisation and control of the ripening processes that determine the quality of the grapes.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
<UL>
<LI>AusVit: Computer-based systems to support pest, disease, nutrition and irrigation management in vineyards.
<LI>An assay which provides a simple, objective measure of the most important components of grape quality, needed to make premium quality wine.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The centre's programs will contribute towards industry achieving its growth targets. Long an important regional industry, Australian viticulture has rapidly enhanced its national economic significance as an export earner over the last decade. Today, rising exports of wine and table grapes are winning new acclaim for our products of the vine - with combined viticultural exports projected to exceed $1 billion by the year 2000.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Australian dried vine fruit production is based around Sunraysia which has a long-standing international reputation for the highest quality. Over 200 wineries operate in Victoria, producing a wide range of boutique and commercial wines. The Victorian wine industry produces more than 15 per cent of Australia’s total wine production.
<P>
<H3>Training</H3>
Research findings are being presented to the commercial grape growing sector through formal University and TAFE courses, field days, seminars, vineyard-based extension activities and targeted communications within the industry.
