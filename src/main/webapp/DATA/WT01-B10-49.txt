<h1 align=center><i>Pain Relief After Surgery</i></h1>

<h2></h2>

<hr>

<p> Newer surgical techniques and anesthetic options enables us to offer effective pain relief for patients who have undergone an operation.  Frequently patients remain relatively pain free after major abdominal surgery are able to return home the next morning!<p> 

During surgery, smaller incisions are made.  A local anesthetic is injected into the incision site before surgery.  If uterine surgery is to be performed the uterus is also injected with a local anesthetic.  Additional local anesthetic is used after closing the incision.  Surgical cautery is limited and surgical retractors and operative packs to hold the bowel from the pelvic cavity are avoided if possible. While these techniques are not feasible for every operation, they may be of benefit when appropriately utilized.<p>

We are familiar with attempts to reduce medical costs.  Staffing levels at most hospitals have been reduced.  Unfortunately that means that a nurse will not always be immediately available when you need a pain shot.  Luckily, we now have techniques that previously were only employed in the operating room that can now be safely utilized post-operatively and enable you to receive pain medication upon demand!<p>

The following types of pain relief are available:<p>

<h3>1.   Opioid Infusion Analgesia</h3>

<p>The two most commonly used drugs are morphine and fentanyl. They are given through the drip continuously at a fixed rate for one day.  Some patients may develop drowsiness, nausea and vomiting with opioids.  This can be used in addition to PCA.

<h3>2.   Patient-controlled Analgesia (PCA)</h3>

<p>The patient administers a fixed dose of opioid in the drip by pressing a button whenever she feels the pain.  A bleep is heard whenever the button is pressed, indicating a successful administration by the patient.  There is no fear of an overdose as the patient presses the button only when she feels the pain. The device insures that an overdose is not administered.

<h3>3.   Epidural Analgesia</h3>

<p>An injection of local anaesthetic is given through a catheter placed into the lower back, which temporarily blocks off any feeling of pain from the waist down. An epidural is administered by a trained anaesthesiologist before the start of a surgery. Following the surgery, a steady drip of medication may be used to control pain during the first 24 hours after your surgery. 

<p>How is an epidural performed?

<p> An epidural is performed by a trained anaesthesiologist.  An intravenous drip is first inserted into the back of your hand. This enables you to get enough fluids.  Then, while you lie on your side, a needle is inserted into your lower back, into the epidural space. It is important to remain still at this stage as a headache may occur if the needle is inserted deeper than desired. However, this rarely occurs and it is treatable.  

<p> A fine plastic tube is threaded through the needle into the epidural space.  The needle is removed, while the tube is held in place with a sticky tape. This allows you to move around without discomfort. Slight soreness may occur at the site of the injection but this is usually temporary.

<p> The local anaesthetic solution is then given through the tube at intervals or continuously in diluted form for as long as pain relief is required.  The effect is felt in 10 to 15 minutes.  An opioid may also be given through the tube during surgery to provide pain relief for 12-24 hours after surgery.
