<dd>GCE O Levels; Mathematics (A), English Language (B), Chemistry (B), Electronics (B), Physics (B), English Literature (C), Biology (C), Economics (C), French (C).</dl>

<dl><dt>1986  - 1988 : Wyggeston   Queen Elizabeth I College, Leicester.  
<dd>GCE A Levels; Mathematics (B), Biology (B), Chemistry (C), Physics (C).</dl>

<dl><dt>1988  - 1992 :  The University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading. RG6 6AP.  
<dd>BSc (Hons) Biotechnology First Class.    Course content :- Biotechnology, Cell Biochemistry, Computing and Mathematics, Enzyme Technology, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Process Engineering and Control. Was awarded the Celltech Prize for achieving the highest grades in the Second Year.  Was awarded first prize for my final year project.

<dl><dt>1992  - 1996 :  The University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading. RG6 6AP.  
<dd>PhD in Biotechnology. Due to finish February 1996. </dl>
<h3> Work Experience </h3>

<dl><dt>Jul  - Sep 1989 : Weetabix, Burton Latimer, Northants.  
<dd>Analytical testing and quality control. 
This involved testing of the product at all points along the process from raw materials to actually purchasing the product from a shop to compare its after sale condition.</dl>

<dl><dt>Apr  - Sep 1990 : Pfizer Central Research, Sandwich, Kent.  
<dd>Research into microbial secondary metabolites. The project required developing a generic system for strain selection and the results from this were later used as a standard code of practice. I was also given three strains of potential pharmaceutical value to improve. By using the generic system previously developed, it was possible to improve the titre for two of the strains by 100 fold. </dl>

<dl><dt>Oct  1990 - Mar 1991 : Celltech Ltd, Slough, Berks. 
<dd>Immunopurification research comparing various matrices to CNBr Sepharose. The two matrices being researched were site specifically immobilised and were therefore supposed to give higher binding efficiencies. The study showed that only one of the matrices lived up to its claim because of the milder conditions used.</dl>

<dl><dt>Jul  - Sep 1991 : Birds Eye Walls, Lowestoft. 
<dd> Assessed and modelled pea damage along the process.  I had to identify all possible damage sources and act accordingly. This involved studying everything from the harvesting to the actual processing plant.</dl>

<dl><dt>Sep  1993 - Apr 1994 : Theale Green School, Reading.  
<dd>Worked one afternoon a week at a local school as part of the student tutoring program by Community Service Volunteers in conjunction with the university.</dl><p>

<h3> Skills and Interests </h3>

   Knowledge of expert systems and various computing systems, especially Sun Systems (SunOS and Solaris), and packages  including   Matlab, Speedup and Uniras. 
I am skilled in numerical analysis techniques and can program in C and Fortran.
I am experienced in HTML and was jointly responsible for making the departmental homepage for the World Wide Web (http://www.fst.rdg.ac.uk/index.htm).
Have a clean driving license.
