<PRE><STRONG><H2>Step 3:  Handpicking</H2></STRONG>
     Handpicking  snails  and slugs1 is one of the fastest  and  safest
ways to reduce their population. Snails are best picked after dark2  or
on  cloudy  days  when they are most active. Water well   a  few  hours
before picking to promote activity on their part. Throw a snail picking
party!. Tell your kids that you will pay them per snail picked. A  good
price is a penny per snail (100 snails equals 1 dollar). Have plenty of
flashlights available. Provide gloves. Have buckets filled either with
salt  and  soapy  water, DE or salt layer, or rock  dust  layer.  Throw
picked snails into a bucket for disposal later.
     Alternatively, you can crush the snails and place  them  into  the
ant cafe as ants love to eat snails. If using rock dust, crushed snails
can be added to compost pile. If you have chickens, feed the snails  to
them.  Pick  up every single snail you see and destroy it.  Snails  can
produce  over  300 eggs per day during laying season and the  eggs  can
stay  buried in the ground for up to 11 years and emerge when the  time
is  right  for  their survival. Another method is to attract  and  trap
them. (See Snail Cafe).

_______________________________
     1  And  especially picking their eggs! The eggs  are  found  below
ground  in clusters or under  rocks and boards. By cultivation  of  the
soil  you  can expose the eggs and simply remove them by throwing  them
away in a plastic baggy.
     2 Best time is really at night since they do their work at night.
