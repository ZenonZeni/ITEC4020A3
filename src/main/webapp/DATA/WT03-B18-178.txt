<h1>Experimental Program Overview</h1>
</center>

Fusion reactions occur in plasma, a state of matter which exists when the
temperature of a gas becomes so hot that the electrons literally "boil off." 
To harness the energy released by fusion, key challenges for
<a href="http://wwwofe.er.doe.gov">fusion research</a>
are to confine these plasmas by magnetic fields and to control the interactions
with the surrounding walls.  <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a> 
participates in national and
international collaborations on large plasma confinement experiments and also
operates the leading facilities in the world for studying the interaction of
plasma with materials.  While the field of plasma physics has been nurtured in
large part by the world's fusion programs, plasmas have found widespread
applications in manufacturing of advanced materials and microelectronic chips,
and in the processing of waste materials.<p>

<h2>PISCES-B Plasma-Surface Interaction Research</h2>

PISCES-B is the leading facility in the U. S. for studies of fusion plasma
interactions with materials.  The facility provides steady-state simulation of
the boundary regions in a burning fusion reactor, with a maximum plasma density
of 2.5 x 10^19/m^3 in deuterium and temperatures in the range of 5 - 30 million
degrees centigrade.  One of the unique features of the facility is a
fully-qualified safety enclosure for performing tests of plasma interactions
with beryllium - one of the leading materials for the plasma-facing walls.<P>

<h2>Plasma Boundary Layer Physics and PISCES-A</h2>

<a href="/www/pisces/piscesa-desc.html">PISCES-A</a> is a plasma wind tunnel used in investigations of atomic processes and
plasma turbulence.  PISCES-A creates plasma conditions in the laboratory
simulating the boundary plasma in a steady-state fusion power plant.  It also
serves as a test bed for validating theory and models which are used in the
design of fusion facilities such as <a href="http://iter.ucsd.edu">ITER</a>.<P>
