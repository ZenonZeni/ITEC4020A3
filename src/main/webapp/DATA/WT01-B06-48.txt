<STRONG>Computer Basics for Investing and Portfolio Management - Part I </STRONG><BR>
By John Bajkowski<p>

<UL><LI>Personal computers continue to drop in price even while their computing power increases.
<LI> Investment software is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, yet easier to use.
<LI> Information services have grown in depth and breadth of investment information while making the retrieval of this data more affordable and simple.</UL>

These developments have put powerful investment tools in the hands of individuals. Now may be the time to look at using a computer to help you in the investment process. These powerful tools make it easier to keep investment records, plan to achieve financial goals, track portfolio performance, gather investment data, evaluate and select securities, and execute trades electronically with a discount broker.<P>
This article is an introduction to computerized investing, and is divided into two parts. This issue provides an overview of the area, and focuses on personal finance and portfolio management programs. In the next issue, I will focus on investment analysis programs. <P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Getting Started</STRONG><P>


Before you run out and purchase a computer, first gain a broad understanding of how computer systems operate. Closely examine your needs and objectives, which will have a bearing on the best system for you. <P>


Computers have largely become commodity items sold next to TVs at appliance centers. But no matter what the ads and salesmen say, computers are complex machines that take time and effort to learn how to use. <P>


It's best to think of a computer as a system that is composed of three parts-the hardware, the software, and the data. All three elements must be in place before you can do anything useful with a personal computer. <P>


As its name implies, hardware consists of the physical components such as the processor, keyboard, monitor and disk drives. <P>


Software consists of the operating instructions that tell your computer hardware what to do. Without it, the computer would sit idly, doing little except drawing electricity. Software tends to be very computer-specific. If a software program was written for a Macintosh computer, it will not run on an IBM without modification. <P>


The data is the information that your computer and software programs manipulate. This data can be entered manually or, in some cases, electronically by obtaining information from an information service. <P>

<HR>

<STRONG>When Selecting Hardware, Pick Software First</STRONG><P>


Software is the pivotal element of the three computer components. It will determine the type of hardware required to execute the software and the type of data that can be manipulated, along with the data source. Yet, when it comes to acquiring these components, people often take the wrong approach. They buy the hardware before finding out whether any software is available that will enable them to accomplish the tasks they have in mind. <P>


The table below illustrates the availability of investment software for IBM and Macintosh systems, the two most popular hardware types. This table, from AAII's annual "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing," clearly illustrates that IBM computers and their various clones have a significant edge over other types of computers when it comes to the amount of investment software. <P>

Does this mean that you have to buy an IBM-compatible computer? No, but be prepared to select from a smaller pool of investment software if you don't. That may mean that you have to settle for a program that may not fully meet your needs, and you may have to pay more for software because of a less-competitive marketplace. <P>


By using a resource directory such as the "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing," you can locate software that will satisfy your needs. From this base, you can determine the type of computer hardware system you should be shopping for. <P>

For instance, in using the guide, you may find that if you are interested primarily in technical analysis, the availability of software is such that you can shop for either an IBM or a Macintosh. But if you are looking for a broad, disk-based fundamental screening program, you may have to lean toward the IBM camp. <P>

When it comes to buying a computer system for personal use, it makes sense to purchase the most powerful system you can comfortably afford. It is an amazing computer fact that no matter what kind of system you purchase, you will wish that it were faster and had more memory and additional storage space a few months down the line. Also be prepared to deal with the notion that soon after you purchase your hardware, it will be available at a lower price. <P>

The software selection will also dictate the type of information service that can be used. Almost all programs will allow data to be entered manually, but some of the better software programs will have built-in routines to automatically access data you specify. <P>

Data retrieval routines must be written specifically for each electronic data service, so most programs will link up to a limited number of databases. Before finalizing your software selection, be sure to check with the data services supported by the software to make sure they are cost competitive and provide all of the data you need. <P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Investment Software</STRONG><P>

Hundreds of investment software programs are available that perform a wide variety of analysis on a broad range of security types. <P>

Nearly 80% of AAII members using a personal computer for investing look toward a personal finance and portfolio management program to assist them in the investment process. It is easy to see why this category is so popular. Keeping track of your securities, their cost basis, their current value, and their performance can be a time-consuming and tedious process. A computer can help you automate the process, giving you time to concentrate on your overall investment strategy and security analysis, not to mention your golf game. <P>

Personal finance and portfolio management software comes in many flavors. At one end of the spectrum are the personal finance programs that look at your complete financial picture. At the other end of the spectrum are portfolio management programs that help you dissect your investment portfolio with surgical precision. <P>

Personal finance programs can be thought of as the Swiss Army knife of the investment software arena. These programs offer modules that assist in budgeting, checkbook management, retirement planning, mortgage and loan analysis, tax planning, and net worth tracking. Some programs even go as far as to offer word processing and appointment management. These are mass-marketed programs that are not written with investors specifically in mind. However, over the last few years, increased competition has led to general personal finance programs with portfolio management modules that satisfy the need of the average investor. <P>

These programs are suited for the individual who wants to use the personal computer to get a grip on their financial situation. Some of the programs like Quicken and Andrew Tobias' Managing Your Money offer built-in checkbook management that not only allow you to print checks via printer, but also allow you to send checks electronically. These programs also allow you to establish budgets and track how well you meet your objectives, and more importantly, help you track how you and your household spend money. <P>

Personal finance programs offer differing levels of financial goal-setting tools. WealthBuilder by Money Magazine takes you through the steps of establishing your current position to planning for specific financial goals and looking at those factors that might prevent you from achieving those goals. <P>

Tracking assets is a fundamental part of these programs. However, the type of assets tracked varies greatly among them. Some provide great flexibility in tracking both financial and real assets and liabilities, allowing you to basically inventory everything you own. Other programs concentrate on liquid, easily priced financial assets, while still others ignore this area totally. <P>

Some programs now offer the built-in ability to access on-line services and update the prices on the securities in your portfolio. WealthBuilder goes so far as to offer the Smart Investor option, which includes items such as quotes, news, mutual fund data, fundamental and technical stock data, and bond data. <P>

Like most portfolio management programs, personal finance programs can track the cost basis of each of your investments; produce year-end capital gain, interest income, and dividend income reports; allow you to price your current portfolio; and provide at least some basic asset class breakdowns of your portfolio. <P>

If you are considering a personal finance program, keep in mind that they were not written with only investors in mind. They may not compute rates of return on your portfolio, and they may not be able to handle all types of securities and transactions. On the positive side, because they are geared toward the mass market, they have many users. This critical mass means that you can buy the software at a computer store or mail-order vendor instead of dealing with the manufacturer directly. You can also find books to assist you in using the program, and it is easier to find other computer users to help you when you have a problem. <P>

Personal finance programs are not for everyone. Some individuals find that a standard paper and pen checkbook register is just fine and they have no need to enter and track all their assets. For these individuals, stand-alone portfolio management programs are the way to go. However, if you feel that your financial program has no focus or that you cannot keep track of where all your income is going, personal finance programs may prove useful. The key to success is determining which features will be useful to you and finding a program strong in those areas. <P>

<HR>
<STRONG>Portfolio Management Programs</STRONG><P>

Moving from the general personal finance program to stand-alone portfolio management software is like going from your family doctor to a specialist. These programs were written specifically to help investors monitor their investment portfolios. This single-task focus allows the program to cover the subject in much more detail. <P>

In comparison with personal finance programs, portfolio management programs will typically handle a wider variety of securities and types of transactions, allow you to track more than one portfolio, update your portfolio through an on-line service, alert you if a security's price hits some predetermined price level, and provide detailed reports on your portfolio. You could expect the program to produce an accurate rate of return for both your securities and your portfolio, track security and portfolio betas and dividend yields, produce a calendar listing maturity dates of bonds, options and futures along with expected dividend amounts and payment dates, provide a breakdown of the industries and asset classes of your securities, and include a flexible cost basis determination procedure. <P>

Portfolio management programs offered by discount brokers such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity even allow you to place brokerage orders on-line and receive additional discounts for doing so. <P>

Of course all of this added flexibility comes at a cost - learning to use all the features will take time. <P>

Do not expect to go to a computer store to try out the various stand-alone portfolio managers. Like most investment-specific programs, portfolio management products make up only a small segment of the overall software market. To buy these programs, you will have to deal directly with the manufacturer. <P>

When selecting portfolio management software, choose carefully. The start-up cost in terms of the time needed to enter the historical purchase information for all of your securities can be quite high. Be sure the program satisfies your current and future needs. Most manufacturers offer demonstration disks of their programs, so be sure to ask to see them before you make your final purchase. If no demo is available, ask for copies of all of the reports produced by the program and check on the firm's return policy - some companies set time limits or charge restocking fees for returned programs. <P>

Also try talking to other investors. Many AAII local chapters have special interest groups that focus on computerized investing. The AAII publication Computerized Investing lists these groups, along with their activities, in each issue. If you already own a computer, communications software, and a modem, you can connect with computerized bulletin board systems (BBS) to get others' opinions. The AAII operates a BBS that can be reached by computer at (312) 280-8565. There is no cost to use this system beyond any standard telephone charges incurred. <P>

If used effectively, a personal finance or portfolio management program will free you of some of the drudgery involved in keeping track of your finances. The table below provides a sampling of the available software for these two areas. <P>

<A HREF="cibasic2.html">Part II </A>of this article will investigate how you can use some of that time to locate and analyze securities with a computer. <P>
