<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Why are Services Growing Faster than Manufacturing?</H1>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of Industry and
the British Economy, containing detailed macroeconomic and industrial forecasts
to the year 2005. These forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics'
49-sector model of the UK economy.  The  report includes an analysis of the
causes of recent service sector growth.</P>
<H3>Consumer spending on services is growing fast...</H3>
<P>The past year has seen a sharp slowdown in manufacturing, with output
actually falling in the last two quarters.  This slowdown is clearly related to
slower growth in exports and lower stockbuilding, both of which have a high
manufacturing content.  Growth in services has also slowed, but by no means as
much.  At the same time consumers' expenditure growth has held up (less than &#189;pp
slower in 1995 than in 1994, whereas non-oil GDP growth slowed by over 1pp) and
is forecast to accelerate in 1996.  Consumer spending on services grew by 3&#188;%
in 1995, compared with an increase of just 1&#189;% on goods.</P>
<H3>...but this doesn't explain the pattern of services growth</H3>
<P>It is tempting to conclude that services are growing faster than
manufacturing because growth is being led by consumer spending, and because this
spending is growing faster on services than on goods.  However, this simple
story starts to break down when the composition of service growth is examined in
more detail.  Chart 1 shows year-on-year growth rates for manufacturing and the
broad service sectors distinguished in the ONS's quarterly national accounts
data.  The fastest growth has been in transport &amp; communications.  Within
this group, UK consumer spending accounts for as much as half of total demand in
just one industry, Air Transport, and there is substantial import penetration
(when UK residents fly with foreign carriers).  While an upturn in spending on
package holidays provides a welcome boost to business, it is not the dominant
explanation for the industry's growth; exports (sales by UK carriers to non-UK
residents) were as important as UK consumer spending for growth of the Air
Transport industry in 1995.  In the fast-growing Communications industry, about
two-thirds of output is for business and government use, and on CE's estimates
these account for about half of the 8% pa growth seen in the past two years.</P>

<P>Among financial &amp; business services, the link between consumer spending
and output growth is even less direct.  Provisional data suggest that the
fastest growth in 1995 was in the three business services of Computing,
Professional and Other Business Services, rather than in Banking &amp; Finance
or Insurance.  In none of these three does consumer spending account for more
than a fifth of sales, a fact that is hardly surprising when the content of
these services is considered.</P>
<P>What, then, is driving the growth of services? In some cases, spending on
service inputs by firms is related to overall activity, including consumer
spending on goods.  The demand for road haulage is determined by the volume of
goods that need to be shifted (including for export).  A key factor determining
firms' advertising spending is the level of overall consumer spending, but
particularly spending on consumer goods (since these are the subject of most
advertising).  Even services bought directly by the consumer are often linked to
spending on goods: the demand for personal loans, car insurance, car dealers'
services and garage repair work depends on spending on cars.</P>
<H3>Services as an intangible investment</H3>
<P>In other cases, spending on services by firms does not merely rise and fall
with overall activity, but has a more pronounced cycle.  Chart 2 shows CE's
estimates for the factors determining output growth in Professional Services
(These include R&amp;D, legal, accountancy, management consultancy, market
research, engineering, architects, surveying and advertising services, and
services auxiliary to financial intermediation such as brokers) during the
recession and the recovery.  `Industrial' demand here means inputs of these
services to industries throughout the economy, including services, and is
calculated on the basis of input-output coefficients that increase at a steady
rate (reflecting the historical trend for these services to account for an
increasing proportion of production costs across the economy).  The residual in
the chart represents the difference between CE's estimate of total demand for
the industry's services and the supply as measured by output plus imports (the
latter are still very small for these services).  What is of particular interest
is that the residual swings from being strongly negative in the recession to
strongly positive in the recovery. Since industrial demand accounts for most of
the industry's output, the residual probably reflects cyclical changes in firms'
purchases of these services.  In fact, the residual follows a similar pattern to
that of company profits.</P>

<P>What this suggests is that the decision to purchase these services has the
characteristic of an investment.  In some cases the purchase is itself linked to
physical investment (for example engineering, architects and surveying).  In
others the service actually is an intangible investment, as with R&amp;D,
management consultancy, market research and advertising.  The fact that London
has a high concentration of these services (and that some of its activities in
other services, such as banking, also have the nature of intangible investments)
is probably at least as important in explaining its performance in the recession
and recovery as the impact of the collapse in house prices on household spending
in the South East.</P>
<P>The popular perception that growth in services is explained simply by the
growth in consumer spending on services is misleading.  It perpetuates the myth
that the long-term growth of services is driven by household spending on
entertainment, eating out and other `luxuries'.  It reflects a view of services
that will become increasingly outdated in a knowledge-based economy, in which
intangible investment is of growing importance for international competitiveness
and long-term growth.</P>
<H2>Investment Spending to Boost Growth in 1997</H2>
<P>GDP growth is forecast to slow to just over 2% in 1996, as the additional
domestic demand arising from faster growth in consumer spending and investment
is met partly out of stocks and partly by stronger imports.  An acceleration in
GDP growth to 3% is forecast for 1997, supported by continued strong growth in
consumer spending, stronger investment growth and a recovery in continental
European export markets.</P>
<P>Manufacturing output is forecast to recover from the second half of 1996
from its present stagnation, helped by stronger investment demand, stronger
growth in exports to continental Europe, and the achievement of a lower ratio of
stocks to output during the first half.  Faster growth in consumer spending on
services is being prompted by low price increases, due to fierce competition and
the impact of technological change.  However, the services that are growing most
rapidly are mainly serving business markets; some are intangible investments
(see above).</P>
<P>The underlying rate of RPI inflation is expected to remain low, accelerating
modestly in 1997 to 3&#188;%.  The headline rate is forecast to be lower than
the underlying rate in 1996, and then to exceed it in 1997, in response to
interest rate changes.</P>
<H2>Notes for Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the European Union in collaboration
with ERECO, the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic and
industrial forecasts available for the United Kingdom.  The projections are
based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
UK economy (MDM), and originally developed in the University of Cambridge
Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 by
Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Alan
Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenous
variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients.  The
model is continually revised and improved to take account of new data and
advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>The current version of the model, MDM9, has 49 industries defined according
to the 1992 Standard Industrial Classification; 19 of these are services.  The
current version of the model has incorporated the change to the 1990 price base,
the 1990 Input-Output Tables and the 1995 Blue Book.  It covers the whole of UK
industry with its 49 sectors and is the leading energy-environment-economy model
in the UK.</P>
<P>Industry and the British Economy is published twice a year.</P>
<P>The cut-off date for the information used in the model run for this report
was 30 April 1996.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies and government
departments by subscription to the company's industrial service at &#163;3,950
per annum, although copies may be purchased individually for &#163;1,750.</P>
<P>xiii+262 pages, with 162 tables and 122 charts.</P>
