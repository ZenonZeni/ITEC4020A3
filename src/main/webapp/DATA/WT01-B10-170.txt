<P> Submissions are welcomed.  The editor seeks corrections, addendums,
whole web pages, book reviews, bibliographies, and images.  All
submissions become the property of the editor, unless otherwise
negotiated or marked with a copyright notice of the valid copyright
holder. <P>

<P> The information at this site is provided with a public-spirited
sense of global community.  If you use this site's information to make a
document please credit the editor (Alan Marr) and give the e-mail
address (alanmarr@monito.com) and site address
("http://www.monito.com/") where possible.

<P> The web provided information from the US, Canada, Japan, Australia,
Germany, England, Sweden, Austria, New Zealand, Netherlands, and Norway.

<P> The information at this site is provided by the editor (Alan Marr)
without warranty for personal use.  Use at your own risk.  There is no
guarantee of the accuracy or quality of the information.  The editor
regrets any inaccuracies, but accepts no liability for the information
provided.

<P> The editor requests that the copyright by Alan Marr covering the
site be respected.  Reproduction by mechanical, photographic, optical,
electronic, chemical or other means is forbidden unless the editor gives
written permission.  Users are permitted to make disk copies or paper
copies for personal use in analogy of maintenance of backups.  In
particular the monkey in a rotor background image is copyright by Alan
Marr.

<P> Any images are the property of the respective copyright holders.
Reasonable attempts have been made to obtain permission, but in some
cases there was no reply, or there was no contact available, or the
trail ran cold.  Where permission has not been obtained, the image has
been used in a derivative fashion by limiting the image to 100 pixels in
height or less.  In most cases it is used to provide a low resolution
link to the full resolution image being published at another site by
someone else.

<P> The editor respects intellectual property and is open to discussion
with copyright holders.  The editor accepts no liability for copyright
violations initiated by others.

<P> Where possible, attribution is provided.  The editor regrets any
inaccuracies or omissions of attribution, but accepts no liability.

<P> The editor apologizes for the legalistic tone of this page, but
thinks that it is all common sense anyway.  Besides, law is but one
manifestation of the concept of cybernetic systems that interests the
editor who had fun writing this in the third person.

The new Telecommunications legislation includes an unnecessary,
onerous, unconstitutional and ultimately unworkable attempt (CDA) to
control the Internet, which in any case is international.  The <A
href="http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html">Blue Ribbon</A> campaign
against it is supported by many Fortune 500 companies, legal groups, and
public interest groups.

<P> Do you <A HREF = "version.html"> not see the monkey </A> in
