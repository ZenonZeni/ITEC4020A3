A new gage verification tool helps ensure QS 9000 
compliance--at least at the earliest stages <BR>in the drive for quality assurance. Here are some of the specifics.

<P>Dr. Hsiao-Wen Lin, head, Research &amp; Development Dept., Measurement Products, Mitutoyo (MTI) Corp. (Aurora, IL), explains that they have developed a new gage tool, the Gage R&amp;R (R&amp;R for &quot;repeatability&quot; and &quot;reproducibility&quot;), to provide a means 
for gage users to comply with the 1995 AIAG (Automotive Industry Action Group) Measurement System Analysis (MSA) standard for ISO 9000.

<P>&quot;We knew compliance was an upper-most concern for our users, and any software gaging tool we were to develop would have to provide that assurance,&quot; says Lin. &quot;So Gage R&amp;R is designed specifically around AIAG's MSA standard. When you have hard-and-fast standards to work with, targeted product design comes somewhat more easily.&quot; Gage R&amp;R was eight months in development and came out of beta testing early this past summer.

<P><B>Operation:</B> Load gage information into the system 
software (which can be done by keyboarding or gage-direct via RS232 serial port). Gage R&amp;R works with all manufacturers' hard gages and will build and maintain a complete inventory, including vendor information, and history of all gage studies and reports. The only limiting factor is resident hard drive size.

<P>Pop-up screen prompts in the Windows format query the parameters of the study to be verified. For example, you may want to prove out three inspectors, inspecting 10 parts, with two trials (two physical measurements), per part (system capacity permits up to 15 of each variable to be verified simultaneously). Gage R&amp;R will then ask which AIAG study type is to be verified--range method (short form), average and range (long form), analysis of variance (ANOVA). There are five AIAG types to select from. Make the selection, and Gage R&amp;R walks you through the study. 

<P>Gage problems, if any, are quickly identified via easy-to-read graphic reports (chart formats include <I>X</I>bar and <I>R</I> charts, whiskers charts, part-by-appraiser charts, scatter plots, and comparison plots) and will reveal inspector problems, part defects, or a gage malfunction. Corrective action (inspector training or replacement, or vendor gage recalibration) is easily identified. If there are no problems, reports, which can be customized to conform to customer needs, are generated 
to demonstrate gage compliance.

<P><B>System requirements</B>: IBM (or compatible) 486SX/33MHz; 4MB RAM; 100 MB storage; VGA monitor; keyboard; mouse; 16 bit Ethernet card for networking; MS-DOS 5.0; and Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher.
