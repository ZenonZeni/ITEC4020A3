Conserving Old-growth Red and White Pine Forest Ecosystems<BR>

<B>Old-growth Red and White Pine Forests in Temagami</B><P>

One of the special features of the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area is the presence of old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems.  Today's old-growth red and white pine forests occur within a relatively narrow band that runs across central Ontario, from the Temagami area in the east to the shores of Lake Superior, as well as in some parts of northwestern Ontario.<P>

In its report to the government, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) expressed support for MNR's approach to protect and conserve old-growth red and white pine forest resources.  The council also proposed a strategy for managing Temagami's red and white pine stands for old-growth characteristics.  The Minister of Natural Resources has accepted the CPC's recommendation that more must be done to inform and educate the public about old-growth forests, and that this should be done during the forest management planning process.<P>

<B>Protecting Temagami's Old-growth Forests</B><P>

During the late 1980s, much of the focus on old-growth forests in Temagami was on the Obabika Lake North Old-growth site.  In 1996, the Government of Ontario has protected this site by expanding the boundaries of Obabika River Provincial Park.  (For further information, please see the fact sheet on the Obabika Lake North Old-Growth Red and White Pine Forest.)<P>

The CPC recommended protection for 44 per cent of the old-growth red and white pine area in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.  Preliminary work by the Ministry of Natural Resources in identifying areas of concern for additional protection has raised the old-growth red and white pine area being protected in Temagami to 52 per cent.  Through its forest management and other land use planning activities, MNR has a provincewide track record of a 65-per-cent level of protection for old-growth red and white pine forests.  Using this as a guideline, the ministry expects that Temagami's old-growth red and white pine forest areas will ultimately achieve this rate of protection.<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources is implementing a provincewide conservation strategy designed to conserve Ontario's old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems.  Fundamental to this strategy is the principle that representative ecosystems in the natural range of Ontario's old-growth pine forests constitute a valuable part of the province's natural heritage, and must be protected for future generations.
 MNR's old-growth conservation strategy was developed from recommendations of the Old Growth Forests Policy Advisory Committee.  The goal of the strategy is to ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems -- including old-growth -- continue to be present now and in the future.  The strategy also includes forest protection and landscape management objectives.<P>

Under the strategy, old-growth pine forests are identified as representative and protected for future generations.  MNR uses a complex range of factors -- including the age of the trees, species associations, diversity, lack of disturbance, stocking, size and integrity -- to assess each old-growth site and determine the methods for protecting or managing the resources.  Around each old-growth site identified as representative, the ministry establishes ecological unit boundaries that take into account the site's natural and cultural heritage, tourism and recreation values.<P>

The Crown Forest Sustainability Act requires that all forest resources in Ontario be managed sustainably, under the provisions of specific forest management plans developed with broad public consultation.  Forest management in Ontario is also subject to the provisions of Environmental Assessment Act.<P>

<B>Restoring Nature's Balance</B><P>

Ontario's strategy for conserving old-growth pine forest ecosystems ensures that this important resource will exist into the future.  Modern silvicultural approaches, such as the shelterwood and seed tree systems, ensure that sufficient seed and good seed beds are available for red and white pine to regenerate after harvesting.<P>

Clear-cutting is not an allowable harvesting approach in old-growth red and white pine forests in the Temagami area.  The shelterwood approach guides commercial operators in adopting special techniques during the harvest and site preparation of old-growth pine forests.  In part, these techniques are designed to re-create the conditions in a forest after a major fire -- conditions which red and white pine trees find ideal for natural regeneration.<P>

A number of techniques are used to ensure that many of the special characteristics of old-growth forests -- including the presence of "super canopy trees," and older, declining and dead trees -- remain present on the site after harvesting.  The techniques allow areas of old-growth forest to be harvested, while providing many of the habitat requirements for the development of another old-growth forest in the future.
 In some areas, efforts to encourage natural pine regeneration are supplemented by planting.  When available, cones from felled old-growth red and white pines are collected and the seeds used to produce new pine seedlings.  The seedlings are planted in areas that originally supported old-growth stands -- giving the young trees a head start on a long and healthy life, and increasing the likelihood that they will one day form part of a thriving Crown pine forest.<P>
