<H3>Quantifying The Disturbance. </H3>
<HR>

<P>
Space data was the only data type that met the requirements for
conducting this assessment within the resources available; as
argued earlier in <A HREF="chap1d.htm">The View From Space </A>.
<P>
A commercially available, geocoded digital mosaic of Landsat MSS
data for the entire continent formed the primary dataset for quantifying
the location, severity and extent of landcover disturbance. The
strategy and associated methodology are now described.
<P>
The principal dimensions of this dataset were two - spectral and
spatial. There was no temporal dimension. This dataset was taken
as a time slice of the continental landcover conditions as of
approximately 1991. No change detection was applied to images
of different dates. The only time dimension in this analysis was
an implied one: all (significant) change detected using the 1991
dataset was assumed to have occurred in the last 200 years. Exactly
when this change occurred cannot be directly inferred from this
satellite dataset alone.
<P>
The project set out to answer one question - what is the current
state of the continental landcover?
<P>
This we hold, makes a small but significant contribution to a
national understanding of the severity and location of biotic
erosion. Another significant contribution will come from quantifying
the dynamics of landcover change; the rate and location of habitat
disturbance across the continent. There are limits to this second
question. The high spatial and temporal resolution of landcover
change is only possible using satellite data since 1972; eg see
<A HREF="refs.htm">Graetz et al (1992), Sivertsen (1994), Wilson et al (1993)</A>.
The rates of clearing can be determined further into the past
using archived aerial photography and surveyor's maps; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Hobbs et al (1993)</A>.
<HR>

<HR>

<P>
The spatial dimension of this dataset was determined by its resolution;
ie by the size of the ultimate unit of data capture and representation,
or pixel. The pixel size of the supplied dataset was 0.001 x 0.001&#176;,
or approximately 1 hectare. Thus the continental aggregate represented
a very large data volume to process. What is more important, this
fine spatial resolution was far, far greater than that of the
Natural Vegetation dataset. The latter was published at a scale
of 1:5,000,000 and appears to have an intrinsic resolution of,
at best, 1 km2, or more realistically 25 km2. Thus, this basic
dataset was 2500 times more coarse than the Landsat source dataset.
Therefore, the Landsat MSS dataset was resampled to 0.005 x 0.005&#176;
(&#152;500 x 500 m or 25 ha) for the analysis and further resampled
to exactly 1 x 1 km for reporting.
<P>
The de-focusing of the satellite dataset may, at a superficial
glance, seem to reduce the acceptance of the findings. Hectare-sized
patches of landscape are human-scaled and easily experienced.
An area twenty-five times larger is less easily imagined in the
mind's eye, and therefore commands less validity. Nonetheless,
the use of coarse (25 ha) rather than a finer-grained (1 ha) pixel
size introduces insignificant error in the overall assessment.
<HR>

<P>
<I>The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet BRISBANE covering the city
of Brisbane, the nearby coast and inland; total area approximately
120, 000 km2. Even with a pixel size of 25 ha, there is an abundance
of detail in the image. Fine details of the dunes and sand blowouts
on Fraser Island are detectable, as are subtle and obvious patterns
within the landscape as a whole. Overall, a visual appreciation
of the extent of clearing and fragmentation of the original vegetation
is easily obtained. If you can do this, then you have instinctively
learned to assimilate both the spectral (colour) and spatial (grain)
dimensions of satellite images. The computer techniques used in
this project imitate the analysis and assessment that you have
just made. </I><HR>

<P>
The final dimension of the satellite dataset - the spectral dimension
- was the most critical because it determines what information
can be derived. MSS data has four spectral channels, traditionally
labelled from #4 to #7, each giving four values for the reflected
light from each pixel regardless of its size. For most landcover
types, these four wavebands are highly correlated and can be reduced
to two: a measure of cover and of greenness. Cover includes both
the cover of dark foliage over the brighter soils and the shadows
within a canopy. Greenness is a measure of the abundance of young
and vigorous leaves within the canopy, be they trees, shrubs or
the herbaceous understorey.
<P>
Under dry conditions, ie with no preceding rainfall, the cover
of live vegetation is linearly but inversely related to the brightness
of one channel, the reflected red radiation recorded as MSS #5.
In this waveband, the intact woody canopy is dark whereas that
of the replacement crop, pasture, or even bare soil, is bright.
In addition, for the interpreter digitally interacting with this
image, there are both spectral and spatial clues to what is cleared,
and what is uncleared woody vegetation. It is remarkably easy
for a human to correctly interpret a complex image. It is considerably
more difficult to achieve the same result using a computer. The
concepts discussed above are illustrated using an image of the
Armidale area of eastern Australia.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/armidale.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/armidale.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet ARMIDALE; total area approximately
120, 000 km2. Setting aside the unnatural or false colours of
the image, just using the clues of tone (light to dark) and the
spatial pattern or texture within the image makes a rapid interpretation
of what is undisturbed natural vegetation, and what has been cleared
for pastures and crops. Much of the remnant natural vegetation
is restricted to areas of significant topographic relief: here
in the ILZ, relief is the most frequent protection against future
clearing. The intensity of the red colour indicates the level
of greenness in the landcover. In this scene, both remnant natural
vegetation and some of the pastures were green on the ground and
were thus portrayed as red in this image. The several smoke plumes
and their location indicate the continuing nature of landcover
disturbance.</I><HR>

<H4>Clearing </H4>

<P>
All spectral channels of the satellite dataset were used to understand
and interpret the images for all vegetation types. For the Intensive
Landuse Zone, the objective of the assessment was to allocate
each pixel into one of five disturbance classes; uncleared, thinned,
cleared, indeterminate, and other.
<P>
The uncleared class was characterised by having an intact canopy;
this being determined relative to all the remnants of any landcover
type. The uncleared class may be disturbed by grazing but within
the ILZ, this was disturbance that could not be separated from
clearing.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0508_016.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0508_016.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
For the landcover types with an open and sparse canopy, ie projected
foliage cover (pfc) &lt; 30%, it was difficult to separate clearing,
the loss of the overstorey, from the effects of acute overgrazing,
the loss of the understorey. This difficulty was one of the two
principal sources of error; see below.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0152_032.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0152_032.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The cleared class was characterised by the effective replacement
of the canopy with a herbaceous layer of crop or pasture plants.
Here the overstorey cover was assessed to be reduced to &lt; 5%;
ie scattered or no trees. The thinned class was determined to
be an intermediate class of tree cover between uncleared and cleared.
It was included to increase understanding of the severity of clearing.
It is our contention that, in terms of biotic erosion, thinned
and cleared are effectively equivalent.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0149_016.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0149_016.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The indeterminate class was assigned by the analyst to two situations.
The most common was where an allocation to clearing was not ecologically
meaningful; eg for a naturally occurring grassland. More rarely,
it was used to indicate that isolated clearing could be detected
by the interpreter but not consistently detected by computer analysis.
This occurred principally in the Northern Territory where what
little clearing has occurred was scattered within a very seasonally
dynamic landscape. The other class was reserved for lakes mapped
within the Natural Vegetation dataset.
<P>
Overall the procedure was straightforward. The allocation decision
rules were based on the expert judgement of the analyst (Graetz)
after intensive examination of the satellite data in digital format.
Decisions were made only after a visual reconnaissance of the
scene and a consultation of ancillary data (maps, etc.).
<P>
After prolonged exploration of the image data for any one vegetation
type, the analyst selected MSS #5 values that separated uncleared
from thinned, and thinned from cleared. Those values and this
channel alone were used to allocate each pixel into one of these
three disturbance classes. Since the Landsat MSS #5 data were
continuous in nature with no obvious thresholds, the choice of
MSS #5 values varied by landcover type and by climatic region.
Thus expert judgement was critical in assigning values to classes.
The allocation process was then computerised.
<P>
We reiterate the point that even at the finest spatial resolution
of 0.001 x 0.001&#176;, a pixel contains a mixture of landscape
elements - tree canopies, shadows, understorey and so forth. This
was particularly so with the pixel size used here, 0.005 x 0.005&#176;,
where the full spectra of mixtures of overstorey and understorey
are possible. The category thinned was created to capture the
most uncleared part of this spectrum where the canopy was approximately
half that of the uncleared state. The category of cleared will
also comprise spectrum mixtures from totally treeless to sparse
scattered trees. The broad classification was adequate for the
focus of this project; ie quantifying that area of landcover that
was uncleared.
<P>
Because of the nature of the number of decision classes and artefacts
within the MSS dataset, there are uncertainties associated with
the assessment values derived. These errors are most usefully
discussed in relation to the uncleared category as being either
errors of commission, where the true value for the uncleared category
is inflated, or omission, where actual value for this category
is diminished. Both error types were unavoidably included in the
analyses reported here.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1863_028.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1863_028.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
A large and consistently occurring error of commission results
from the cleared grassy landscapes often being green and actively
growing at the time of image acquisition. This tends to darken
them towards the signature of cleared woody canopies with the
result that a proportion of the cleared class was allocated to
uncleared. One example of this error of commission is in Armidale
image where green actively growing pasture (reddish in colour)
occurs in a N-S strip just to the west of the Great Dividing Range.
This landcover is obviously non-woody canopy, being quite distinct
to the eye from the neighbouring forested upland remnants. Nonetheless,
it was impossible to set decision rules that consistently separated
this green pasture from the surrounding forest remnants because
those to the east were also green and actively growing (reddish
in colour) while those remnants to the west were not.
<P>
This source of uncertainty was inherent in the dataset and intensive
and systematic efforts to remove it failed. Moreover, careful
selection of decision rules to minimise this error lead to the
converse omission error in the drier, less dense canopies. Overall,
a strategy was followed to minimise the size of the error and
to stabilise its sign; ie consistently to one of commission or
omission. The decision rules for the uncleared category were always
set not only to achieve the smallest uncertainty possible in the
situation, but also to keep the error consistently one of commission.
Furthermore, the emphasis was on getting the values correct for
the more mesic landcover types, the forests and woodlands. This
strategy was hampered by significant variation within the dataset
that was not related to the surface. The net result was that there
were both errors of commission and omission in the results reported
here. The difficulty is illustrated by the Albany image. <HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/albany.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/albany.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The south-west of Western Australia. This area experiences
both high rainfall and cloud cover almost all the year. As a consequence,
the cleared areas of crops and pastures, are usually green. Under
these conditions, it was far more difficult to separate uncleared
from cleared for landcovers near the coast than it was in the
drier inland. Significant errors of commission and omission were
possible with small changes in the decision rules set for this
scene that is a spectacular example of loss and fragmentation
of natural vegetation.</I><HR>

<H4>Grazing And Burning </H4>

<P>
The objective for the Extensive Landuse Zone of the continent
was to use satellite data to allocate part or whole of each vegetation
type to one of the following disturbance categories: slight, substantial,
significant, indeterminate, and other.
<P>
The allocation was to reflect the contemporary level of disturbance
imposed by the two principal agents of landuse; grazing by domestic
stock, and to a much smaller extent, repeated burning. The impact
of grazing is by far the most influential in generating both systemic
and cumulative landcover changes.
<P>
The temporary and cumulative impacts of grazing on the landcover
can be detected and interpreted using satellite data for most
vegetation types. Similarly, even though the dataset used was
uni-temporal, some appreciation of the nature of the fire regimes
can be interpreted, but this was far less certain than that for
grazing.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1865_076.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1865_076.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The critical difference between the assessment of grazing and
burning, and that for clearing, was that the former cannot be
implemented by computer. The assessment of the disturbance level
can only be based on expert decision and opinion; a decision that
was reached only after detailed interpretation of the spectral
and spatial patterns within the image, and the integration of
ancillary data.
<P>
The subjective component of this assessment was thus higher than
that involved in the assessment of clearing. To maintain a high
level of transparency, the source document contains example images
that explain and support the decision taken for each vegetation
type. <HR>

<P>
The nature of the evidence and its interpretation is exemplified
by the Rawlinna image.
<P>
<A HREF="reptill/rawlinna.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/rawlinna.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The Nullarbor Plain near Rawlinna, Western Australia, pastorally
occupied and a part of the ELZ. The predominant landcover type
is a low open chenopod shrubland - bluebush and saltbush country
- with sparse mulga inland. The landcover consequences of pastoralism
are quite obvious from 900 km in space and with a coarse ground
resolution of 25 ha. The landcover change within whole paddocks
and around watering points can easily be detected and assessed
by eye. The level of disturbance here ranges from substantial
to significant. However, when this relatively small area of this
landcover type was considered along with the all the others not
within this scene, the disturbance level was assessed overall
as substantial.</I><HR>

<P>
Where natural grasslands (xG) were designated by the Natural Vegetation
dataset within the ILZ, they were allocated to the indeterminate
class for the clearing assessment and manually interpreted for
the ELZ.
<P>
Finally, there is no category for undisturbed. There is no vegetation
type that was absolutely undisturbed by the direct (landuse) or
indirect (feral animal) effects of human activity. Therefore we
used a relative scale: by definition landcover types that were
designated unused or protected by tenure were used as benchmarks
for the assessment and were always set to disturbance category
1, slight.
<P>
Furthermore, the disturbance rating that was finally assigned
took into account local variations in disturbance level, such
as shown in the <B>Rawlinna image </B>above, as well as the condition
of the landcover type that occurred within the ILZ but was not
actually cleared.<HR>

<H4>Doing It Yourself </H4>

<P>
At this point, the reader may be less than convinced that all
of this interpretation and assessment of landcover disturbance
is possible using satellite data.
<P>
It is not easy to illustrate this without drowning the argument
with images. Therefore we have included a set of images covering
the continent in a section called <A HREF="ausindex.htm">Exploring Your Country</A>.
Each image covers one sheet of the excellent 1:1, 000, 000 map
sheet series and are named accordingly. We recommend that you
explore your country using each of these images (5&#176; x 6&#176;
in size) and try to interpret the type and level of landcover
disturbance that you can detect.
<P>
For the ILZ, the interesting areas are in the south-western corner
of Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. For the
ELZ, the interesting areas are South Australia, the Northern Territory,
Queensland and Western Australia.
<P>
If you have a particular interest in the state of the national
forests, then examine New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.
