<H2>Journalists Group Denounces Press Freedom Violations in Bosnia - Urges OSCE Enforcement Of Dayton Guarantees For Media</H2>
New York-- In an <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="boslet.html">urgent appeal</A> to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) denounced blatant violations of the Dayton Peace Accords' press freedom guarantees and called for stricter OSCE enforcement in the days remaining before the September 14 elections.  <P>

Severe restrictions on the physical mobility and editorial freedom of local print  journalists  and broadcast media have compromised the internationally supervised election process, CPJ said.<P>

"By definition, no election can be considered truly free and fair unless the news media is able and willing to report fairly and openly to the entire electorate  on the campaigns of all major contending  parties, and all reporters, local and foreign, are free to cover the news without restrictions on their movements or justified fears of reprisals," CPJ said in a statement sent to the OSCE.<P>

"With few exceptions,  throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, these standards have not been met,"   said CPJ&#146;s executive director, William A. Orme, Jr.<P>

CPJ is a private nonpartisan organization based in New York and devoted to the defense of press freedom around the world.   <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../pubs/bosnia96/breport.html">A CPJ report on press freedom conditions in Bosnia</A> was sent  Thursday to Flavio Cotti, chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and also sent to NATO leaders, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  and leading  European foreign ministers.<P>

The statement denounces attacks on reporters attempting to cover opposition parties and obstruction of freedom of movement for journalists. Conditions are particularly harsh in Serb- and Croat-controlled areas. Reporters brave enough to drive between regions are intercepted and sometimes beaten. Correspondents are dismissed or censored for articles "harming the national interest."  Independent radio stations  have their signals overridden by state-run broadcast media or cut off entirely by well-timed "power outages."  Television screens go blank during critical newscasts or candidates' debates.  Air time allotted to the opposition is withheld. An internationally supported experiment in nonpartisan broadcasting,   IN-TV, known as "Carl Bildt's TV" after  the High Representative in Bosnia, has been  blocked by the Bosnian government's refusal to grant a frequency.  Bildt told  CPJ  chair Kati Marton that IN-TV will be begin broadcasting tomorrow but acknowledged that its impact will be largely limited to major cities. <P><br>
