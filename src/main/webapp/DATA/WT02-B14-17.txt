Congress in March took up proposals by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)--S S269 and
S1394, and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX)--HR2202, the Immigration in the
National Interest Act--to deal with legal and illegal immigration.   <p>
On March 21, the House approved the part of the Smith bill that seeks to reduce
illegal immigration on March 21,1996 by a vote of 333-87.  However, the House
voted 238-183 to drop the reductions and changes in the legal immigration
system proposed in the bill.<p>
The Senate Judiciary Committee on March 28 voted 13-4 to send bills to the full
Senate for consideration April 15-17 that would deal with both legal and
illegal immigration.  The legal bill is the opposite of Simpson's original
proposal--it would INCREASE the number of visas available to unify families to
500,000 per year, and not impose fees on US employers who want to admit
immigrants to fill US jobs.<p>
Opponents of the proposed reductions in legal immigration split the
comprehensive bill into legal and illegal components, under the theory that
there are more votes in Congress to reduce illegal than legal immigration.  <p>
In June 1995, the Clinton administration endorsed the Jordan Commission
recommendation that legal immigration be reduced from about 800,000 in FY94 to
550,000 per year, with the temporary addition of 150,000 visas per year to
clear the backlog of spouses and children of legal immigrants waiting to join
family members in the US.  <p>
Despite that endorsement, the Clinton administration supported the division of
the immigration bill, probably ensuring that the legal immigration system will
not be changed in 1996.<p>
<b>House</b>.  The House began consideration of its comprehensive reform of
legal and illegal immigration on March 18, 1996, and on March 21 approved the
part of the bill that aims to reduce illegal immigration by a vote of 333-87.<p>
One of the first amendments offered was to split the bill into separate legal
and illegal components, as the Senate Judiciary Committee had done on March 14.
The House vote to split the bill was 238-137--an "unusual coalition" of
President Clinton, liberals and ethnic advocates, high-tech businesses,
libertarians, and the religious groups including the Christian Coalition
opposed reductions in legal immigration--many of these groups opposed
immigration reform in 1986.<p>
The bill approved by the House would beef-up-the-border bill and add new bars
to access by illegal aliens to education and welfare.  The bill as approved
would double the Border Patrol from 5,000 to 10,000 agents by the year 2000,
authorize the construction of a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican border
south of San Diego, and set up a five-state pilot project that permits
employers to verify the work eligibility of all new hires by checking a
computer data base.  The House rejected the Smith bill's effort to make Social
Security cards more counterfeit-resistant by 1999.<p>
The House also approved, 257-163, with Speaker Gingrich's support, a so-called
"Proposition 187" amendment that permits states to deny public education to
illegal alien children, and to prohibit states from offering federally financed
welfare benefits to illegal aliens.  Parents who are illegal aliens could not
apply for welfare assistance for their US-born and thus US-citizen children.
US-born children of illegal alien parents could still get AFDC and Food Stamps,
but a third party would have to apply for such benefits on behalf of the
children.<p>
Many experts believe that, if Congress approves the denial of free public
education to unauthorized children, the US Supreme Court will reverse the 5 to
4 Plyler vs Doe decision in 1982 that found unconstitutional a 1975 Texas law
that kept unauthorized children out of school.  In the Plyler decision, the
Supreme Court acknowledged that education was not a "fundamental right," but
the majority decision emphasized that Texas provided no evidence "suggesting
that illegal entrants impose any significant burden on the state's economy."
<p>
California asserts that about five percent or 350,000 children in K-12 schools
are unauthorized, and that their education costs $1.8 billion per year.<p>
To cut down on the use of false documents, the bill reduces from 29 to six the
documents that workers can present to employers to prove their legal status,
and treats document forgers as harshly as money counterfeiters.  The approved
bill permits the imposition of fines of $50 to $250 on people caught inside the
US illegally, and permits state and local law enforcement officials to detain
illegal aliens until the INS can take custody of them.<p>
The House on March 21 rejected by a 242-180 vote an effort by growers to launch
a new guest worker program.  On March 5, 1996 the House Agriculture Committee
approved 25 to 14 an amendment by Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA) to the House
immigration bill that would grant temporary work visas to 250,000 foreign farm
workers, with the ceiling to be reduced by 25,000 each year.  The existing
temporary farm worker program admitted about 17,000 H-2A workers in 1995.<p>
There are about two million workers employed at some time during a typical year
on the nation's crop farms, and a DOL survey estimates that 25 percent may be
unauthorized.<p>
Under the Pombo proposal, growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting
to employ foreign farm workers would have had to file at least 25 days before
the job was to begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with their state
Employment Service office listing the number of foreigners requested and when
work was to begin.  Local ES offices would review these LCAs "only for
completeness and obvious inaccuracies" within seven days after they are filed.
Employers violating their attestations or program rules can be assessed civil
money penalties, and be debarred from the program.<p>
Under the rejected plan, 25 percent of the foreign workers' wages would be
placed into a federal trust fund managed by the INS, which foreign workers
could reclaim with interest in their country of origin.  Foreign workers would
be limited to a maximum two years in the US.  Program costs would be financed
by employer contributions equivalent to Social Security and unemployment
insurance taxes that would not be paid by growers.<p>
The guest worker program would sunset after three years if Congress fails to
re-authorize the pilot five-state telephone verification system that the Smith
bill establishes to make it easier for employers to determine whether workers
are presenting false documents. <p>
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) argued against the guest worker program: "once you
admit hundreds of thousands of people like this, why not just pull the Border
Patrol off the border and let people in?"  The Clinton administration opposed
the program for fear that it would increase illegal immigration, reduce job
opportunities for US workers, and depress wage and work standards for US
workers.  The Clinton administration also believes that the current H-2A
program is sufficient for businesses that are experiencing labor shortages. <p>
After the House Agriculture Committee vote, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and
US Attorney General Janet Reno wrote to Senate Judiciary chairman Orin Hatch
(R-Utah) that they would "strongly recommend" a veto of the entire immigration
legislation if it included temporary foreign farm worker provisions for
agriculture.<p>
On March 20, the House voted 221-191 to split the Smith bill and to deal only
with illegal immigration.<p>
To reduce legal immigration, both the Senate and House bills would have
eliminated immigration slots for relatives such as adult sons and daughters and
adult brothers and sisters of US citizens, but added slots for five years to
expedite the unification of nuclear families of legal US immigrants.  Some
850,000 of the 1.1 million foreigners waiting to enter the US to join legal
immigrant fathers or mothers are the families of persons legalized in 1987-88.
Half of these spouses and children are believed to be already in the US with
their families.<p>
The bill approved by the House requires Americans who wish to sponsor an
immigrant to earn at least twice the poverty level income.  This means that the
requirement will double from the $14,800 for a family of four required in 1993.
The bill also makes legally binding sponsors' agreements to assume financial
responsibility for the immigrants they bring to the US.<p>
One of the most contentious issues in Smith's legal immigration reform bill is
whether to eliminate immigration visas for the adult brothers and sisters and
adult sons and daughters of US citizens.  Among the arguments for doing away
with these categories is that most such siblings are adults with families,
whose immigration therefore sets off chain migration.<p>
A GAO study released in March 1996 concluded that chain migration occurs, but
not soon after immigrants naturalize.  According to the GAO, an average 12
years elapsed between the time an immigrant enters, and the date the immigrant
petitions for the entry of relatives. <p>
The Smith bill would require adult children wishing to bring their elderly
parents to the US to provide health insurance for them.<p>
<b>Senate</b>.  When the Senate Judiciary Committee met to consider the Simpson
bill on February 29, 10 of 18 senators were prepared to vote to split the bill
into legal and illegal components.  Simpson delayed consideration of the bill
for one week, and then dropped a proposal to reduce the number of immigrants
admitted for economic/employment reasons each year from the current 140,000 to
90,000--there were 93,000 admissions of workers and their dependents for
economic/employment reasons in FY95.  <p>
On March 14, the Senate Judiciary Committee nonetheless voted 12 to six to
split Simpson's bill into legal and illegal components, and approved amendments
that would keep fines against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens at
current levels, rather than increase them as Simpson proposed-- first offenses
currently can result in civil money penalties (CMP's) of $2,000 per worker.
The committee also voted to eliminate the requirement that employers caught
repeatedly hiring illegal workers could have their property seized.<p>
Simpson also dropped a plan to require US employers wanting permanent
immigrants to pay the greater of $10,000 or 10 percent of the first year's
salary into a fund that would be used to train US workers to fill similar job
vacancies in the future, as well as a plan to prohibit US employers from
dismissing US workers and hiring temporary foreign workers to replace them.
The  bill as approved would prohibit US employers from applying for a temporary
foreign worker if they have laid off a U.S. worker with the same skills in the
previous six months.<p>
US high technology companies and Jack Kemp, co-director of Empower America, led
the fight against Simpson's proposed fees.  A report entitled "Employment-Based
Immigration and High Technology" argued that immigrants admitted permanently to
fill vacant US jobs provide "extraordinary benefits" to the US.  The report
predicted that new restrictions on employment-based visas would "drive more
companies to locate research and development offshore, and will lead to less
innovation, a less dynamic economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edge
industries of tomorrow."  <p>
The CEOs of Silicon Valley companies weighed in with assertions that their
companies have unfilled vacancies for engineers, and that the immigrants on
their staffs are necessary to create good jobs for US workers.<p>
INS data indicate that most of the visas granted to immigrants on employment
grounds go to technicians with two years of training, not to persons with
"extraordinary ability" or to "outstanding professors and researchers."<p>
In 1994, about 123,000 permanent immigration visas were issued for
economic/employment reasons.  About half--60,000-- of these visas went to the
spouses and dependents of the "needed workers"--only 40,000 visas went to
workers, including 4,000 to "unskilled workers."  Another 22,000 visas went to
Chinese students who were studying in the US when the Tiananmen Square massacre
occurred in 1989.<p>
Foreigners are admitted for employment reasons under three preferences.  There
were 21,000 first preference admissions in FY94, but only 1,300 went to "aliens
of extraordinary ability," and 1,800 went to  "outstanding professors or
researchers."  Some 5,000 went to "multinational executives or managers;"  this
category required at least one year's employment with the company.  Finally,
13,000 visas went to the spouses and children of first preference workers.<p>
There were 6,800 visas issued to second-preference workers with "exceptional
abilities" and "professionals with advanced degrees,"  including artists who
caught the eye of a US opera or dance company while studying in the US.  Many
of the artists seeking to become legal residents under the second employment
preference complain that, because they are self-employed or freelance
performers and do not have a US sponsoring employer, they find it hard to
secure legal immigrant status.<p>
The largest share, about  60 percent of the economic/employment visas in FY94,
went to the third preference for "skilled workers, professionals and other
workers" with at least two years training or experience.<p>
The number of third-preference visas has grown from 40 percent of all
employment visas issued in 1992 to 60 percent in 1994.  According to corporate
executives, it is difficult to find Americans for the jobs filled by
third-preference immigrants, especially administrative assistants.   <p>
The "growth wing" of the Republican party, which generally backed Steve Forbes
to be the Republican candidate for president, favors more immigration.  Their
"manifesto for immigration" in the Wall Street Journal February 28, 1996 called
immigration a "brain gain" for the US, and quoted former President Reagan
saying that his "shining city on the hill"--a metaphor for the US-- needed
walls, but with doors "open to anyone with the will and heart to get here."
<p>
Simpson proposed changes to the legal immigration system that would eliminate
immigration visas for adult relatives of US citizens, but add visas to expedite
the unification of nuclear families of legal immigrants.  Some called Simpson's
plan to deny entry to up to 2.5 million relatives such as adult brothers and
sisters of US citizens who are on waiting lists to immigrate, and to add visas
for the spouses and children of aliens legalized in 1987-88, a "reward" for
lawbreakers, and a penalty on those who "played by the rules."<p>
To reduce illegal immigration, Simpson's bill proposes an expansion of the
Border Patrol by 700 agents, from the current 5,500, increased penalties on
employers who hire unauthorized workers, and the elimination the requirement
that the INS obtain search warrants before entering open fields to check for
illegal alien workers.  On March 21, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-4
to require a triple fence to be built along the Mexico-US border south of San
Diego.<p>
On March 7, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to substitute a three-year
pilot program to verify the legal status of newly hired workers, and applicants
for public assistance, rather than the national verification program within
eight years originally proposed by Simpson.<p>
On March 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-4 to modify the process of
allocating visas for family unification.  Under the approved revision, US
citizens can sponsor spouses, minor children, and parents each year--there is
no quota, but 250,000 admissions annually are expected.  In addition, the
approved amendment would permit another 175,000 immigrants to come to the US
for family unification reasons--at least 75,000 would be reserved for the adult
children of US citizens, and the other 100,000 would be available, in order,
for spouses and minor children of legal immigrants, adult children of US
citizens, adult children of legal immigrants, and adult brothers and sisters of
US citizens.<p>
There is a backlog of 1.1 million spouses and minor children seeking to join
legal immigrants in the US, and a backlog of 1.6 million adult children and
brothers and sisters of US citizens waiting to enter the US.  The Senate bill
would provide an extra 75,000 visas for 10 years to reduced these backlogs.<p>
Current law permits 480,000 family unification immigrants annually.  The Senate
bill, as amended March 28, would permit 500,000 family unification immigrants
per year for 10 years, a four percent increase.<p>
Simpson's proposal to allow the INS to hire 600 retired federal employees to
process backlogged asylum applications and exempt them from a law that reduces
their salaries to account for their federal pensions was eliminated on March 5
by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight's Civil Service
Subcommittee.<p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Presidential
Candidates and
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
Immigration divided the "Big 4" candidates for the Republican presidential
nomination, which was wrapped up by Bob Dole on March 19 in the Midwestern
states, and confirmed March 26 in California.<p>
Candidates Dole and Buchanan argued over who supported Prop. 187 more
vigorously in 1994; Forbes and Alexander opposed Prop 187.  Dole and Buchanan
favor reductions in legal immigration, and making English the official language
of the US; Forbes and Alexander would keep legal immigration at current
levels.<p>
All the Republican candidates promised to do more to reduce illegal
immigration.  Buchanan favors construction of a wall or fence along the
southwestern border, and Dole supports Simpson's bill in Congress to add more
Border Patrol officers and experiment with a registry so that employers could
more easily determine who was legally authorized to work in the US.  Alexander
called for a new branch of the military to deal with border control.<p>
Clinton and Dole reportedly have similar immigration positions, with the
exception that Dole favored Prop. 187 while Clinton opposed it.  During the
third week in March, Buchanan pledged to build a 2,000-mile long fence, the
Clinton administration announced progress in slowing immigrant smuggling, and
Dole visited the border to announce that he supported the "Prop. 187" amendment
included in the House immigration reform proposal to deny free public education
to unauthorized children.<p>
Buchanan was the only Republican candidate to attack employers who hire illegal
aliens:  "There are many corporations which are repeatedly hiring illegal
immigrants and firing their American workers... You have to repeatedly fine and
punish companies that do that."<p>
Republicans are divided on immigration--54 percent favor a "five-year ban on
all legal and illegal immigration into the US," according to a Wall Street
Journal/NBC poll.  Some pundits argue that issues that seemed like sure winners
for Republicans in 1994--Prop. 187 and opposition to affirmative action and
racial preferences--in 1996 may get Republicans labeled as "fanatics."  <p>
A March 1996 Newsweek poll found that 36 percent of respondents think recent
immigrants have burdened their communities, versus 31 percent who believe that
recent immigrants contributed to their communities--33 percent said that
immigrants had no significant effects.<p>
However, Governor Wilson is advising Dole to focus on immigration and
affirmative action to close the 20-point lead that Clinton currently has over
Dole in California. <p>
Because of difference in demography and business,  immigration did not play as
big a role in the Texas primary as it did in the California contest.  In Texas,
about 15 percent of the 9.5 million registered voters are Hispanic.  Voters in
Texas can vote either Republic or Democratic in the primary.  Texas politicians
are concerned that attacks on illegal immigration could tarnish the state's
relationship with a major trading partner, Mexico.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC4">INS:
Sanctions, Apprehensions, Immigration, and
Naturalizations</a><a></a></h2>
<u>Sanctions.</u>  The San Francisco Chronicle published a long article on
March 18, 1996 reporting that fewer than half of the 12,700 US employers that
INS inspectors recommended be fined between 1989 and 1994 for employing illegal
aliens or not completing I-9 employee verification forms were in fact fined.<p>
The INS has 320 workplace inspectors to check on seven million US employers.
The average INS fine levied on employers between 1989 and 1994  was $1,612.
INS fines are often characterized by employers as a "the cost of doing
business."  <p>
On March 21, 1996, the INS announced its largest ever fine--a $1.5 million fine
on suburban New York janitorial firm Colin Cares for knowingly hiring over 150
illegal aliens, and for 2,500 cases of paperwork violations.  Over 2,500
unauthorized workers were dismissed from the company's 4,000 person work force.
Colin Cares cleaned buildings that housed, inter alia, IBM and ATT.<p>
The INS plans to hire 384 additional workplace inspectors in 1996, bringing the
total to about 700 in the 19,000 employee INS.<p>
In addition, there are about 900 federal labor inspectors who contact the INS
if they suspect that illegal aliens are employed when they check for minimum
wage and other violations.<p>
The Chronicle emphasized that there are significant discrepancies in
enforcement between cities.  For example, the INS collected more CMP fines from
employers in Laredo, Texas than in Los Angeles, and made more collections in
Grand Island, Nebraska than in Fresno, California.  The INS collected twice as
many fines in Cleveland as in San Francisco.<p>
The number of INS workplace inspectors dropped by half between 1989 and 1994.
Consequently the number of workplace investigations dropped from 14,700 in 1989
to 6,000 in 1994, as the INS diverted resources to deporting criminal aliens
and going after immigrant smuggling rings.<p>
The INS estimates that 90 percent of US employers comply with laws that aim to
prevent the employment of unauthorized aliens.  DOL investigators, on the other
hand, estimate that only about 47 percent of employers are in compliance with
immigration laws.  The INS usually gives three days notice before inspecting
workplaces, and obtains permission from workers before interviewing them--DOL
does not.<p>
<u>Apprehensions.</u>  Some 1,381,465 foreigners were apprehended by the US
Border Patrol in calendar year 1995, up 43 percent from 965,144 in 1994.  In
some areas of Arizona, apprehensions increased 500 percent over 1994 levels,
and are higher in 1996 than 1995.  <p>
In the remote Arizona town of Douglas, the number of Border Patrol agents
jumped from two in the early 1980s to 127 in 1996, and migrants unable to cross
the border south of San Diego reportedly paid $800 to smugglers to get them to
Chicago through Douglas.  Most aliens carry no money with them; their friends
and relatives pay the smuggler when the alien is delivered.<p>
No one knows whether the increased number of apprehensions reflects more
Mexicans attempting illegal entry, or more success by the Border Patrol in
apprehending foreigners, or some combination of the two.<p>
President Clinton on March 19 unveiled his FY97 budget, and it included a 16
percent increase in the INS budget, to $3.1 billion, to cover the cost of an
additional 826 Border Patrol agents and 1,889 other INS employees.  Clinton
also proposed $500 million to reimburse states for the cost of incarcerating
unauthorized aliens.<p>
Academics at the University of Houston estimated that up to 330 unauthorized
aliens die each year trying to sneak into Texas, usually by drowning in the Rio
Grande.  Many of the poor US counties along the border do not have medical
examiners, so many of the bodies found do not have $500 autopsies performed to
determine the cause of death. Only about 40 percent of the estimated 3,200
alien deaths between 1984 and 1994 were recorded by the state of Texas.<p>
Surveys of 2,500 Mexicans in four central Mexican villages found that the
number of persons headed for the US was up 30 percent in 1995 versus 1994.
However, some analysts argue that the cost of migration has increased with the
stepped-up Border Patrol presence, and the increased number of apprehensions
simply reflects their success in apprehending a steady number of persons
attempting entry.  <p>
Other reports indicate that smugglers' fees are usually paid by US friends and
relatives when the alien is successfully delivered, so that the peso
devaluation would not affect these presumably US-earnings.<p>
In Brownsville, Texas, 54 Honduran children were found abandoned by smugglers
who "rented" them to make it easier to adults to be smuggled into the US.  Of
Honduras's population of 5.5 million, 2.7 million are minors under 18 years of
age, and 28 per cent of Honduran children aged 10 to 17 do some kind of work<p>
The INS has 316 miles of various types of fences along the 2,000 mile
Mexican-US border.<p>
<u>Immigration</u>.  The number of legal immigrants admitted to the US in FY95
fell to 720,461, down 10 percent from 804,416 in FY94, and down 20 percent from
904,292 in FY93.  There were only 85,336 employment-based immigrants and their
families admitted [the quota is 140,000 per year], and there were declines in
the number of spouses and parents of US citizens, and a special program that
permitted 55,000 dependents to join newly legalized immigrants expired in 1994.
There were 106,827 refugees who were recognized as US immigrants in FY95.  <p>
Of the 85,000 employment-based visas issued, only 37,000 or 43 percent were
principal workers--the others were their spouses and children.<p>
The major countries of origin were Mexico (12.5 percent), the Philippines (7.1
percent), Vietnam (5.8), the Dominican Republic (5.3), China (4.9), and India
(4.8).  States of intended destination included California (166,482), New York
(128,406), Florida (62,023), Texas (49,963), New Jersey (39,729), and Illinois
(33,898)--immigration was down in each of these states except Florida.<p>
Immigrants arriving in FY95 indicated that they were moving to states that
previously not receiving large numbers of immigrants, such as Georgia and
Michigan.  California was the destination of 29 percent of all immigrants in
FY93, but only 23 percent in FY95.   <p>
One-third of California's 166,482 immigrants in FY95 were from Mexico (21
percent) and the Philippines (14 percent).  The Los Angeles-Long Beach area
received 54,669 legal immigrants in FY95, half the 106,703 in FY93.<p>
It is not yet clear whether the recent drop in immigrant admissions signifies a
trend toward less immigration.  Some of the FY95 drop may be due to delays in
setting up the so-called "245i" adjustment program, which permit persons
already in the US to adjust their status rather than return to their countries
of citizenship and present themselves to a consular officer.  An analysis of
1990 Census data found that about 30 percent of the persons counted as
immigrating in 1990 were living in the US in 1985.<p>
Backlog, apprehension, and other data suggest an increasing, not a decreasing
influx of immigrants.  There are about 2.7 million foreigners on immigrant
waiting lists.<p>
The Current Population Survey estimates that the number of Mexican-born
residents in the US jumped by 500,000 between March 1994 and March 1995.  Since
there were 111,000 Mexican immigrants in FY94, this suggests that four
unauthorized Mexicans may have arrived in the US for each legal immigrant.<p>
<u>Naturalization</u>.  The INS also announced in March 1996 that its
Citizenship USA drive handled 500,000 citizenship applications in FY95.  In
1990, only 40 percent of the 19.8 million foreign-born persons in the US were
naturalized US citizens, the lowest level in many years.  Beginning in 1994,
the number of immigrants applying for naturalization surged.<p>
The INS hopes to reduce what is now a one-year wait in some cities between the
time that a settled immigrant applies for US citizenship on an N-400 form and
is scheduled for an INS interview.<p>
About 75 percent of the one million applications filed in FY95, and the one
million expected in FY96, are filed in five cities--Los Angeles, Miami, New
York, Chicago, and San Francisco.  <p>
According to election experts, newly naturalized US citizens mostly vote
Democratic.  In New York City, West Indians, who have achieved more political
power than any other immigrant group in that city, vote Democratic. Dominicans,
the city's largest immigrant group, vote primarily Democratic.  Most Colombian
and Ecuadorian immigrants are registered as Democrats, more than half of them
voted for the Republican mayoral candidate. <p>
The Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles
estimated in March that 80 percent of Asian immigrants eventually become U.S.
citizens.  Asians are less likely than whites to register to vote, but those
who are registered are among the most likely voters to go to the poll on
election day.  In 1994, 75 percent of the registered Asian Americans voted,
compared to 73 percent of the whites, 64 percent of the Hispanics and 63
percent of the African Americans.  <p>
The Asian-American population is 7.2 million, and is projected to be 11 million
in the year 2000, and 20 million by 2020.  According to one study, "Asian
Pacific Americans: Reframing the  Immigration Debate," one-fourth of the high
tech companies in California's Silicon Valley are run by Asian-Americans.
Among Americans 25 to 38 years of age in 1990, Asian Pacific Americans were
twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have received a post-college
degree.<p>
On March 5, 1996, California again sued the federal government asking that it
either take custody of the roughly 18,000 illegal aliens held in California
state prisons, or fully reimburse California for the cost of incarcerating
them.  <p>
California has about 138,000 inmates in state prisons-- 38,000 were born
abroad, and 18,000 are believed to have been unauthorized aliens when they
committed crimes that had them sentenced to one year or more.  California
estimates that it spends about $22,000 per prisoner per year, or $400 million
to incarcerate illegal aliens--90 percent are Mexican nationals.  One estimate
is that 98 percent of all illegal immigrants who are deported for committing
felonies in California eventually return to California and, of those who
return, 40 percent will commit crimes again.<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno acknowledges the federal government's
responsibility, but points the finger at Congress for not providing the
necessary funds to incarcerate the illegal alien criminals.  In FY95, the
federal government had $63 million to pay for illegal immigrant prisoners; and
it expects $500 million in 1996-97.<p>
In January 1996, the INS deported over 5,000 criminal aliens, keeping on its
announced pace of deporting 62,000 criminal aliens in FY96.  Two-thirds of the
criminal aliens deported so far in FY96 are Mexican nationals. <p>
Persons held less than one year, and until trials, are usually held in city and
county jails.  California's Orange County found in a September 1995 survey of
the jail that 35 percent of the inmates were illegal immigrants.  Under a
proposed program, an INS agent stationed at the jail will identify illegal
immigrants prior to their first court appearance and arrange for deportation.<p>
The INS announced in March that the second Special Cuban Migration Program
would permit Cubans in Cuba between 18 and 55 who satisfy at least two of three
conditions--completed secondary school, have three or more years of work
experience, and have relatives in the US--to register for one of 20,000
immigration slots designated each year for Cubans.  The application period is
from March 15 to April 30, 1996.  As of March, more than 8,400 Cubans have been
approved for legal migration to the US under this program.  <p>
Some Cubans who have returned to their homeland say that they been victims of
reprisals, and claim that the US is not taking seriously their complaints of
retaliation.  They complain that instead of treating them as victims of
political persecution, the US tells them to apply for one of the 20,000 slots
for Cuban immigrants.<p>
Some returned Cubans have reported difficulty in finding and keeping jobs
because they are labeled politically "unreliable."<p>
The INS also announced in March that it would extend until March 27, 1997 the
Temporary Protected Status of about 4,000 Liberians who have been in the US
since 1991.<p>
On March 20, 1996, green cards issued to permanent resident aliens before 1979
expired, and all immigrants had to obtain new pink cards that are harder to
forge, and that must be renewed every 10 years.  Thousands of immigrants jammed
INS offices on March 20 for the new cards, despite several extensions of the
deadline to renew their cards.  There were believed to be about 1.5 million
legal immigrants with the old green cards in November 1993, when the
replacement program began.<p>
Lawful immigrants are required to carry evidence of their legal immigrant
status, and expired green cards no longer provide that evidence.  The INS urged
those who qualify to apply for naturalization rather than another green card.<p>
Profiles of Central American migrants who lived for five to 10 years in the US
after applying for and being rejected for asylum in the US emphasized that few
parents facing deportation want to take their children back to Nicaragua or El
Salvador with them, and that many parents simply disappear when they are
finally ordered to surrender to the INS.  In a recent Sacramento case, a
Nicaraguan woman with five children who were born in the US fled instead of
surrendering to the INS for return to Nicaragua. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">US
and California Population
Growth</a></></a></a></a></a></h2>
The US Census Bureau reported March 12 that, by 2050, the non-Hispanic white
share of the population would drop to 53 percent, down from 74 percent in 1995.
The Hispanic and Asian shares of the population are expected to more than
double to 24 and eight percent, respectively.  The African American share of
the population will climb slightly to 14 percent in 2050, up from 12 percent in
1995.<p>
In 1995, there were about 193 million non-Hispanic whites, 31.5 million blacks,
26.9 million Hispanics, 8.7 million Asians and Pacific Islanders and about two
million Native Americans.<p>
For the first time in 200 years, a non-white group contributed more to annual
population increase than non-Hispanic whites.  According to the Census report,
"U.S. Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin: 1990-1995,"
in 1993-94, the US Hispanic population increased by 902,000, and the
non-Hispanic white population increased by 883,000.  <p>
The US population is expected to increase by 2.4 million per year, from 263
million in 1995 to 394 million in 2050.  Fueled by immigration--the Census
assumed a net influx of 820,000 legal and illegal immigrants annually-- and
births to immigrants, the Hispanic and Asian populations in the US are expected
to grow by over three percent per year, faster than the growth of Mexico's
population in 1995, which was 2.2 percent per year.  The white population is
projected to increase by about 0.4 percent per year.<p>
The new forecasts lower projected immigration from 880,000 to 820,000, but
increase projected fertility by NOT assuming that the currently higher than
average fertility of Hispanic and Asian women will converge to lower average
levels for the US population. <p>
By 2030, non-Hispanic whites will be a minority of the US population, but
almost three-fourths of those 65 and older are projected to be non-Hispanic
whites.  <p>
The New York Times billed these projections as a "profound demographic shift."
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee, who has written extensively on the political
implications of demographic change in California, noted that in this case,
California today exemplifies the nation's future.<p>
In 1970, California's population composition was similar to that of the US
today--about three-fourths non-Hispanic white.  Today, non-Hispanic whites are
about 50 percent of the population, Hispanics are almost 30 percent, and
Asian-Americans are approaching 10 percent.  <p>
Walters emphasizes that the VOTING population changes much more slowly than the
population-- non-Hispanic whites may be only 50 percent of the population in
California, but they cast 80 percent of the votes in the 1994 election.
Non-Hispanic whites have a median age of almost 50, versus about 30 for
Latinos.<p>
Some speculate that the combination of ethnic shifts and age twists may make
very contentious federal policies that redistribute tax funds from younger
minority workers to older white residents.  In Fall, 1996, for example, the
number of K-12 pupils is expected to reach 52 million, surpassing the 1971 baby
boom peak, and to rise to 55 million by 2002, in part because of immigration
into cities that sold of demolished school buildings in the 1980s.<p>
There are about 24 million foreign-born persons in the US--immigrants who moved
to the US from other countries are about nine percent of all US residents.
Most are in the US legally, the number of unauthorized aliens in the US is
believed to be about four million.  About 75 percent of the legal immigrants,
and 85 percent of the unauthorized aliens, are believed to be in six
states--California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois.<p>
In 1970, there were about 10 million immigrants in the US, and 20 countries had
sent 100,000 or more of their citizens here.  By 1990, there were 41 countries
from which 100,000 or more citizens migrated to the US.<p>
In 1970, the average foreign-born person earned more than a similar US-born
person--similar in terms of years of education and age.  In the mid-1990s,
foreign-born persons earned less than similar US-born adults, leading to what
some call the "de-skilling" of immigration, and allegedly increasing the effect
of immigrants at the bottom of the labor market, and increasing immigrant
welfare costs.  Some studies suggest that 20 to 40 percent of the increase in
the wage gap between the least and most skilled workers in the US is due to
immigration.<p>
The US Census Bureau reported in October that,<b> </b>among the nation's 271
metropolitan areas, three of the four fastest-growing are along the US-Mexican
border.  Between 1990 and 1994, the population of Laredo, Texas grew by 22
percent; the population of McAllen, Texas by 20 percent; and, the population of
Yuma, Arizona by 19 percent.<p>
The US population was 263 million on July 1, 1995.  About 83 percent of the US
population is white, 13 percent African American, 10 percent Hispanic, and four
percent is Asian.  <p>
California's population was 31.6 million on July 1, 1995, including 9.1 million
in Los Angeles county, 2.6 million each in San Diego and Orange counties, and
1.6 million in San Bernadino county, and 1.3 million in Riverside county.  In
Los Angeles, immigration is transforming neighborhoods--Watts is now 70 percent
Hispanic, up from 60 percent in 1994.<p>
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan predicted that, "in 15 years, Los Angeles
will again be a town with a strong middle class, mainly Latinos and Asians.
They will make relatively less money than the average middle-class citizen
today, but there will be more houses with two, three or four wage-earners."<p>
Between July 1994 and June 1995, some 383,000 California residents left
California, bringing to 1.5 million the number of residents who left the state
since 1990.  However, California's population continued to increase because of
immigration and a baby boom--there were 343,000 more births than deaths.<p>
The Census uses July-June years to report population changes and, it noted that
net foreign immigration to California peaked at 296,000 in 1992-93, dropped to
260,000 in 1993-94, and dropped again to 234,000 in 1994-95.  These immigration
data mirror national trends--net US immigration was 835,000, 754,000, and
702,000 in these years, giving California 35, 34, and 33 percent of US
immigrants in the 1990s.<p>
During the 1980s, California's population rose by 25 percent, while the US
population rose by 10 percent.  The US population was 262.8 million on July 1,
1995, including 31.6 million in California, 18.7 million in Texas, and 18.1
million in New York--one in four US residents lived in these three states.
California's population is expected to be 36 to 38 million by 2005, depending
on the strength of the state's economic rebound.<p>
These population changes were driven largely by demography and economic
circumstances.  The US economy added 1.7 million jobs in 1995, bringing payroll
employment to 117 million.  California added 300,000 jobs in 1995, bringing its
payroll employment to 12.6 million.  Unemployment in December 1995 was 5.6
percent, and 7.7 percent in California.<p>
California has 7.7 million foreign-born residents, or 40 percent of the
nation's immigrants.<p>
As California bounces back from recession, there is renewed interest in whether
the state that would be the world's seventh largest economy presages trends
elsewhere in the US economy.  Some students of the California economy argue
that California's experience simply reflects national trends, so that slow
economic growth and strained public finances, inequality, and rising health
care costs reflect developments common to the US and many other industrial
economies.<p>
The California economy produces goods and services worth about $900 billion
annually.  Almost one-fourth of all California households have incomes above
$75,000 per year, versus about one-fifth of US households.<p>
California's 1980s boom, 1990s bust, and mid-1990s resurgence is centered in
Los Angeles county, which accounts for almost one-third of California's
population and labor force.  Los Angeles county lost almost half of its
defense-related jobs between 1988 and 1995.  Since 1990, Los Angeles county
lost about 510,000 jobs, but gained back about 150,000 of them by 1996.<p>
Los Angeles county now has about 133,000 aerospace jobs, down from 300,000, and
130,000 motion picture jobs, which some consider only 50 percent of the total
employment in the industry because of the large number of independent
contractors and persons affiliated with the motion picture industry.<p>
The California-is-unique analyses, on the other hand, argue that California's
economy has been affected primarily by defense cutbacks, immigration, and rules
and regulations that stifle business expansion.<p>
The percentage of Americans living in poverty fell from 15.1 percent or 39
million in 1993 to 14.5 percent or 38.1 million in 1994.  The poverty rate is
determined by multiplying the cost of a minimum diet by three--persons whose
income falls below this line are considered poor--the income needed to lift a
family of four above poverty in 1994 was $15,141.<p>
These census data measure pretax income.  If the value of in-kind transfers
such as health insurance or public housing is included, the number of poor
people falls; if the cost of food is one-fourth rather than one-third of a poor
person's expenditures, the number of poor people rises. <p>
The median income of American households was $32,264 in 1994, practically
unchanged from 1993.<p>
Many of the welfare programs being debated in Congress aim to prevent children
from growing up poor.  According to a recent Government Accounting Office
review of census data, about 17 percent of the school-aged children (five
through 17) were living in households with below poverty-level incomes in
1990--some 7.6 million children.  <p>
However, 31 percent of the school-aged children in households headed by
immigrants lived in poverty-- 709,000-- including 43 percent of the children in
households headed by an immigrant from Mexico--299,000--and 40 percent of the
children in households headed by an immigrant from Vietnam--46,700.<p>
Population growth and change are linked closely to issues such as social
security funding.  In 1995, there was one person 65 and older for every four
persons 20 to 64; by 2030, the ratio will be almost two older for every three
of working age.<b></b><p>
<b></b>The US Census has announced that it will use sampling to enumerate the
projected 276 million residents on April 1, 2000.  The 2000 Census is expected
to cost $3.9 billion.<p>
Under the new plan, the Census will use several attempts to get completed
census questionnaires until 90 percent of the households in a county have
responded (in 1990, 63 percent of households returned Census forms by mail).
Then Census interviewers will visit a random sample of the 10 percent of
households that did not respond, and use this interview data to estimate the
characteristics of non-respondents.  It is still planned that one in six
households will get the "long form" that requests information on income,
housing, and other items. <p>
On March 20, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the 1990 Census does
not need to be adjusted, despite an acknowledged undercount of especially urban
minorities.  The city of New York and 23 other cities filed suit against the
Bush administration when it refused to adjust the 1990 Census to account for
the estimated 1.6 percent  of the 250 million residents who were not counted in
particular cities and states.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Mexico</a>
Professionals Being Drawn to
US</a>
</a></h2>
Mexican professionals such as teachers and doctors are reportedly being drawn
to the US because of unemployment in Mexico.  According to a March 4 story in
the Wall Street Journal, some teachers who could earn $35 per week in Mexico
prefer $200 per week picking fruits and vegetables across the border in
southern California.<p>
Over the past 25 years, the number of Mexican college
graduates--licenciados--increased in all fields.  Over 1.3 million Mexicans
graduated from college in the 1980s, when there were only 300,000 jobs created
for them, persuading some of them to emigrate for jobs.  One Mexican dentist
who graduated in 1986 reported that 25 percent of his classmates were working
in the US--usually not as dentists.<p>
NAFTA permits governments of one member nation to accuse another for allowing
violations of its own labor laws.  The US made four complaints since January
1994--two involving GE plants in Mexico, one involving a Sony plant, and one
involving a Honeywell plant.<p>
For the first time, Mexico accused the US of not remedying a US labor law
violation.  On July 14, 1994 Sprint closed a facility that sold long-distance
service to Latinos, just before a union election by the 200 largely
Spanish-speaking employees.  An NLRB administrative law judge sided with
Sprint's argument that the facility was closed for lawful economic rather than
unlawful anti-union reasons.<p>
The governor of Guerrero took a leave of absence while Mexico's Supreme Court
investigated his possible role in a June 1995 massacre of 17 peasants by
police.  An investigation by state officials led to the jailing of several
police officers, but exonerated the governor.  Mexico's current
decentralization of power is illustrating the practically unlimited power of
some state governors, and corruption in the police and judiciary.<p>
Mexican local police, who reportedly earn $135 per month in Mexico City, and
the federal police, who earn about $250 per month, have in some instances
fought one another for the right to "protect" local drug dealers and supplement
their incomes.<p>
Mexico in March 1996 rejected October 1995 suggestions by US Defense Secretary
Perry to conduct joint US-Mexican military exercises.  However, three US
military incursions into Mexico over the past 150 years led Mexico to reject
the presence of US troops on Mexican soil.<p>
The number of people living along the Mexico-US border was about 100,000 in
1900, and about 10 million in 1995, making water an increasingly contentious
issue between the US and Mexico--El Paso residents use about 210 gallons per
person per day, versus about 70 gallons in Juarez.<p>
Nicaragua in 1996 began to issue new and more counterfeit-resistant passports.
Under the Sandanistas, Nicarguan passports were sold or given to foreigners who
supported the regime, including five persons involved in the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993.  At least 900 passports have been issued to persons wanted for
terrorism, including Italian Red Brigade leaders.<p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Immigration
</a>and
Vot</a>ing</a>
</a></h2>
A federal court issued a ruling on March 11, 1996 that upheld the creation of a
horseshoe-shaped Chicago congressional district to remedy past discrimination
against Hispanics.  The 4th congressional district was created after a 1991
lawsuit that led to Illinois' first Latino-majority district, represented by
Luis Guitierrez since 1992.  The decision is expected to be appealed to the US
Supreme Court. <p>
The decision may affect how Chicago ward maps are drawn, although some Hispanic
leaders claim wards are different because the boundaries are negotiated by the
Latino leadership.  However, current ward maps are being challenged by the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which argues that the
boundaries were drawn to protect Aldermen John Daley, brother of Mayor Daley,
and Edward Burke.  <p>
In a comparison of immigrant political influence in the nation's two largest
cities, it was emphasized that immigrants in New York City are more likely to
gain political clout than immigrants in Los Angeles because many more
immigrants in New York have legal status.  Further, it is easier for immigrants
to have political influence in New York's 52-seat city council than in Los
Angeles, which has only 15 seats in its  city council and a five-member board
of supervisors.<p>
There is much speculation about the "sleeping giant" of Latino political power
in California.  The number of Latinos in the California Senate and Assembly
doubled from seven in 1992 to 14 in 1996, despite a decline in the number of
Democrats in California.  There are 10 Latinos in the 80 member Assembly, and
four Latinos in the 40 member Senate.<p>
About nine percent of California voters were Latino in 1992, 11 percent in
1994, and possibly 15 in 1996.<p>
In Santa Clara county, California, the number of Mexican-born voters increased
by 22 percent between February 1995 and February 1996, but they still were only
8,500 of the county's 728,000 registered voters.  There are 14.1 million
registered voters in California.<p>
Some older immigrants in citizenship classes say they want to become US
citizens because they fear that the government will cut off Medicare and Social
Security benefits for legal immigrants. <p>

There were about 300,000 applications for asylum in the EU in 1995, down
slightly from 305,000 in 1994, and down over 50 percent from the peak 674,000
in 1992.  About 40 percent of Europe's asylum applications were in
Germany--128,000 in 1995.  In the Netherlands, asylum applications fell to
53,000 in 1995 from 29,000 in 1994, and in Sweden, from a peak 84,000 in 1992
to 4800 in the first half of 1995.<p>
Some estimates are that EU countries removed 200,000 aliens in 1995.  Britain
sent 2,600 aliens to their countries of origin in 1995, Germany sent 60,000 by
air out of the country, and France removed 10,000 aliens.  The centers where
aliens are held before removal-- Amsterdam has Grenhospitium, Britain has
Campsfield, Transit Centre 127-Bis is in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium, and Cortemark
in Germany --the biggest such center in the EU--have become the targets of
immigrant rights protests.<p>
EU officials from home affairs and interior ministries meet under the auspices
of the K4 Committee, Steering Group 1 (Asylum and  Immigration), to coordinate
their efforts to deal with asylum seekers.  With their support, most EU
countries are drawing up a "white list" of countries from which an applicant
for asylum has the duty to prove that he is suffering political persecution,
and no right of appeal if the applicant has come via another "safe" country.<p>
The unemployment rate in the 15-nation EU is 11 percent, and is higher for
foreigners than EU nationals.  There are some 10 million non-EU nationals in
the 15-member EU, and the EU is under pressure to permit, e.g., a Turkish
immigrant in Germany to move freely to France. <p>
In Rome, thousands of people representing political parties, trade unions and
immigrants rights activists marched in Rome on March 16 to demand better
conditions for the 520,000 illegal, and one million legal, foreigners in Italy.
<p>
The number of Europeans aged 60 and over is projected to double to 114 million
by 2025, and the over-60 population will be one-third of all residents.  Some
estimate that, to keep social welfare states viable, up to seven million
immigrants annually may be needed, versus the current 500,000.<p>
The top 10 countries attracted 300 million of the world's 567 million tourists
in 1995, according to the World Tourism Organization in Madrid.  France
attracted 61 million tourists in 1995, followed by 45 million each in Spain and
the US, 29 million in Italy, and 23 million each in China and the UK, 22
million in Hungary, 20 million in Mexico, 19 million in Poland, and 18 million
in Austria.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC10">Germany:
Ethnics, Kurds</a>, and
Construction</a>
</a></h2>
<u>Ethnic Germans</u>. The German Social Democratic Party was accused of
fanning the flames of xenophobia when its leaders campaigned against allowing
220,000 ethnic Germans to move from the ex-USSR to Germany each year, saying
that they "migrate directly into the unemployment benefit and social security
system."  Germany spends about $2.2 billion annually to support and integrate
ethnic Germans.  <p>
Most ethnic Germans, who acquire German citizenship automatically, vote for the
governing Christian Democratic Union.<p>
Ethnic Germans are persons descended from Germans invited to Russia's Volga
River valley in 1762, but then deported to Siberia and Central Asia during
World War II.  Germany's 1949 Basic Law includes the provision that ethnic
Germans who suffered because they were Germans have the right to enter Germany
as citizens.<p>
Germany has already reduced the benefits available to ethnic Germans, reducing,
for example, the length of state-financed German-language education from 15
months to six.<p>
According to the SPD, Germany cannot absorb ethnic Germans when unemployment is
11.1 percent, meaning that four million persons were jobless.  Over half of the
unemployed in Germany are women.<p>
On March 24, voters in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig Holstein
and Baden-Wurttemberg elected state parliaments, and the SPD saw its share of
the vote decline by between four to six percent in each state.  The liberal
Free Democratic Party had a surprisingly strong showing.  Although the
elections do not directly affect the federal government, Helumt Kohl claimed
that the votes supported his policies. <p>
Dieter Spori, the SPD candidate for state premier who had campaigned against
the immigration of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union, said he would
no longer play a leadership role in the SPD after he lost the election in
Baden-Wurttemberg.  Spori conducted a populist campaign that included attacks
on immigrants. <p>
On the other hand, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said he did not believe his
party's losses in the three states was due to opposition to ethnic German
immigration.  According to a March 1996 survey, 70 percent of
Germans--especially those in the former West Germany--agreed with Lafontaine's
call for a stoppage or severe restrictions the influx of ethnic Germans.<p>
The governing coalition and church groups denounced the SPD.  Some 397,000
ethnic Germans arrived in Germany in 1990.  Beginning in 1993, a quota of
220,000 per year was introduced.  Germany has been admitting about 200,000
ethnic Germans per year since 1988; about 80 percent were born after 1945.  The
government argues that the ethnic Germans take farm and factory jobs that
Germans shun.<p>
Interior Minister Manfred Peuchel of Saxony-Anhalt said that the migration of
young East Germans to West Germany, and the aging of the remaining population,
means that the former East Germany needs young ethnic Germans.<p>
In Sohren, a town of 2,000 south of Coblenz, about 1,200 ethnic Germans are
living in former US military barracks, and their presence has created divisions
in local schools, where non-German speaking children sometimes outnumber the
native-born children.<p>
There are about 7.2 million foreigners in Germany, but only about 10,000
non-ethnic Germans are naturalized each year.<p>
<u>Kurds.</u> Turkish Kurds living in Germany went on "rampages" March 9 and 16
in northwestern Germany.  Demonstrations were planned in anticipation of the
Kurdish new year March 21, and Kurdish demonstrators clashed with police who
tried to remove banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) banners--PKK banners are
illegal in Germany.  There are believed to be active 3000 PKK members in
Germany.<p>
The resulting violence led to "consensus" that foreigners who organize or
participate in violent protests in Germany should face deportation.  There are
between 400,000 and 500,000 Kurds among the two million Turks in Germany, about
the same proportion as among Turkey's 60 million residents.  Kurds have been
fighting to succeed from Turkey since 1984.<p>
On March 27, the Kohl coalition in Bonn agreed to expel foreigners involved in
illegal demonstrations by redefining participation in a banned
demonstration--currently a misdemeanor--to be a severe violation of public
order that leads to automatic expulsion.  <p>
Police raided the asylum center in Halberstadt on March 22, and seized PKK
materials.  About 1,300 of the 1,900 asylum seekers in Halberstadt are Kurds.<p>
Seven people died and 73 were hurt in 146 fires in hostels for refugee  asylum
-seekers in  Germany in 1994 and 1995--in 41 cases, arson was suspected.<p>
<u>Construction</u>. On March 22, some 12,000 workers demonstrated in Munich
against the employment of foreigner workers at wages below those paid to German
construction workers.  Under current rules, subcontractors based in another EU
country can legally undercut German pay rates by recruiting in their own
countries at local rates then sending the workers to a German building site.<p>
On March 23, another 6,000 workers demonstrated in Magdeburg. <p>
In collective bargaining to implement a German government proposal to resolve
the EU construction worker issue, IG Bau demanded a minimum hourly wage of
DM19.58 for non-German EU workers from the first day of their employment in
Germany, up sharply from the current DM12.  Employers offered DM15, and the
issue was sent to an arbitrator for a decision by April 8.<p>
If there is no agreement, the union could call the first ever nationwide strike
in construction.<p>
The European Council's social affairs committee on March 29 tackled the issue
of paying all EU workers the same wage at the same work place.  The UK, Ireland
and Portugal have fought the proposed "equal pay" directive.  <p>
A compromise has been proposed by the Italian president of the EU, which would
stipulate that the "equal pay" directive would apply to EU workers immediately
when an EU national is employed in another EU country.  The previous proposal
would have permitted lower wages for the first month of employment.<p>

<a name="RTFToC11">France:
African Immigrant
Sit-in</a></></a></h2>
On March 18, 1996, some 400 immigrants from Mali, Senegal and Mauritania began
a week-long  sit-in at a church in Paris to demand French residency permits.
The African immigrants were evicted on March 22 by police despite a reported
assurance from Prime Minister Alain Juppe that police would not enter the
church.<p>
About 300 of the immigrants then moved to a gymnasium, where two days later the
police again removed them to prevent any "risk of violence."  Juppe was
criticized in the press for the March 24 pre-dawn raid.  Many of the Africans
involved have lived in France for more than 10 years without residency papers.
<p>
Days after the evacuation, 67 of the immigrants were in a Paris court.  On
March 27, a French appeals court overturned a lower court ruling that released
38 of the immigrants arrested during the sit-in, and the police are expected to
overturn another court order that released some of the other immigrants.  Most
of those released had disappeared by the time the first court ruling was
overturned.<p>
On March 28, 50 of the asylum seekers were flown to Mali.<p>
The French government said that the church sit in was a staged protest.  The
government announced on March 26 that it will close some of the loopholes that
allowed the first court to release some of the immigrants apprehended, and
strengthen laws that remove immigrants from France.  Draft interior ministry
legislation includes rules that would establish fingerprint banks, computer
lists of people harboring aliens, and simplified procedures to deport illegal
aliens-- only 20 percent of the aliens ordered deported from France are
actually removed from the country.<p>
The number of foreigners naturalizing in France rose 30 percent in 1994
compared to 1993.  About 26 percent of the new French citizens were Moroccans,
15 percent were Portuguese, 10 percent were Tunisian, and nine percent
Algerians.<p>
The number of French residents rose to 58.3 million in 1995, reflecting the
difference between 710,000 births, 529,000 deaths, and 45,000 net immigrants.
About 36 percent of the births were to unmarried mothers.<p>
There are about four million foreign-born persons living legally in France, and
up to one million unauthorized aliens.<p>

<a name="RTFToC12">Asylum
in UK</a>
</a></h2>
On March 5 an immigration judge ordered the British government to reconsider
its decision to deport Mohommed al-Masaari to the Caribbean island of Dominica.
The judge said that the government had attempted "to circumvent the Convention
(on Refugees) for diplomatic and trade reasons."  The Saudi government had
threatened to break British arms contracts if the Saudi dissident was allowed
to remain in the US.  <p>
The judge told the Home Office to reconsider Masaari's asylum application
within one month.  <p>
The Saudi dissident runs a North London-based organization called the Committee
for Defense of Legitimate Rights, which advocates replacing the Saudi monarchy
with an Islamic government.  <p>
The British government is considering plans to increase the number of people
deported by elevating the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Department
to executive agency status, and rewarding managers for meeting deportation
targets.  Britain deports less than 10 percent of failed asylum seekers--the
rest disappear or reapply for asylum.  <p>
In 1994, there were 32,800 asylum applications-- 4,500 foreigners were allowed
to stay in Britain, and 1,580 people were deported.  The remaining 26,720
people are unaccounted for. <p>
In 1995, all 2,000 Nigerians who applied for asylum in Britain had their
applications rejected.  A 70-page report issued by the Refugee Council on March
25, also said that all Rwandans, and 91 percent of the Sri Lankans, were
rejected for asylum despite civil unrest in both countries.<p>
The High Court ruled on March 27 that the withdrawal of welfare benefits from
most asylum seekers under new government regulations was lawful.  Foreigners
who do not apply upon their arrival are not eligible for income support,
housing benefit, or other welfare payments.<p>
The High Court noted that 32 per cent of the 2,900 asylum applications filed in
1984 were approved, but that only four percent of the 32,800 filed in 1994
resulted in a grant of asylum suggesting to the Court that the government acted
properly in reduce benefits to mostly false asylum seekers.<p>
On March 5, 1996, the British government promised local authorities
compensation to meet legal obligations to asylum seekers.  Local councils must
house people, including asylum seekers, under homelessness legislation until at
least the summer  of 1996, when the Asylum and Immigration Bill is expected to
become law.  Local councils will have to care for the children of asylum
seekers beyond that date under the Children's Act.  <p>
The British Home Office asked the Commission on Racial Equality to draw up
guidelines to prevent employers from discriminating against minorities to avoid
fines under the proposed employer sanctions law.  Under the proposal, employers
could face criminal penalties and fines of up to L5000 ($7,700) if they
knowingly hired an illegal worker.<p>
The number of illegal aliens caught working in the UK increased from 4,000 in
1988 to 10,000 in 1995.<p>
Prime Minister John Major announced on March 4 that up to two million Hong Kong
residents will continue to be able to visit Britain without visas after 1997.
They will be able to visit Britain for up to six months, and will not have the
right of abode or to work. Some Tory MPs feel that the UK faces an illegal
immigration "nightmare." <p>
Major also announced that Hong Kong's ethnic minorities, primarily Indians and
Pakistanis, would be guaranteed the right to live in Britain after the turnover
if they came "under pressure to leave Hong Kong." <p>
After the announcement, other European countries were expected to may adopt
similar policies toward Hong Kong residents.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Immigration
in
Poland</a></></a></a></a></a></h2>
In 1994, 74 million foreigners entered Poland, including eight to nine million
citizens of the former Soviet Union, many to request asylum, others for
employment, and some to transit to the West.  Poland receives 500 to 600 asylum
applications every year. <p>
Poland permits immigrants to enter for economic reasons as long as an
individual can prove strong ties to the Polish community and the ability to
contribute to Polish society.  Those seeking employment in Poland receive work
permits on the basis of employer guarantees.  <p>
In 1994, 14,000 work permits were issued to foreigners.  However, under a new
regulation that took effect in October, 1995, first-time work visas are issued
only at Polish consular posts abroad.<p>
The Polish Border Guards Commandant said on March 26 that Poland must have a
more effective control of border traffic to prevent border crime.  In April,
1996, 10 new watch-towers will be built and two to four helicopters will begin
to patrol the border, including the Polish-Lithuania border where 20 airplanes
reportedly illegally smuggle in people and goods. <p>
The Border Guards report that border enforcement has already reduced illegal
immigration.  The Border Guards admit that the smugglers from the CIS and Asian
countries are better organized and equipped than they are.  About 12,000
illegal immigrants were stopped at the border in 1995.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Turkey</a>:
 Economic
Meltdown?</a></a</a></a></h2>
Turkey, one of the world's major potential countries of emigration, was thrown
into political uncertainty after the Islamist Refah party won 158 seats in the
550-member Parliament in elections held December 24, 1995--the next two largest
parties have 135 and 132 seats.  <p>
The Refah or Welfare party's success was attributed to honest local governments
in the 23 cities it controls, including Istanbul and Ankara, and grass-roots
campaigning at weddings etc, putting the party closer to many people than the
mainstream parties.  Refah opposes the current Turkish ban on headscarves in
public offices, arguing that culture is religion, and that women who want to
cover their heads should be allowed to do so.<p>
Turkey is often described as a country on a knife edge, sometimes tilting
toward Europe, and sometimes toward the Middle East.  To try to win the
December election, the government printed money, and in 1996 inflation, the
budget and trade deficits, and interest rates are up, and several
closely-watched businesses such as car assembly announced plans to close at
least temporarily because of falling sales.  <p>
Real incomes in Turkey fell about 20 percent in 1995, the social security
system is bankrupt, and privatization is much slower than planned.  As in
Mexico, the government keeps going by offering Turks--who buy two-thirds of the
country's debt--interest rates of over 100 percent for three and six month debt
instruments.<p>
Some speculate that the military could stage a coup, as in 1980, to restore

Sweden, which deported Kurds who lied about their identity--usually claiming to
be Iraqis--has agreed to reopen " thousands" of cases to determine if the
foreigners really needed protection in Sweden despite lying about their true
identity.  Some 500,000 people were granted residence permits in Sweden, which
has a population of 8.5 million, between 1979 and mid-1995.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC16">Japan:
 Managing Migration</a>
</a></h2>
On March 6-8, 1996, Nihon University hosted a conference on the Dynamics of
Labor Migration in Asia.  Selected papers on labor recruitment and the
migration transition will be published in a special issue of the Asian and
Pacific Migration Journal, edited by Philip Martin, Andy Mason, and Toshikzau
Nagayama.<p>
The conference was unusual in three respects.  First, it focused on three
understudied issues--labor contractors and smuggling, trade in services and the
migration of professionals, and the migration transition, or the movement of a
country from being a net labor exporter to being a net labor importer.<p>
Second, these issues were examined comparatively, with researchers'
presentations being critiqued by policy makers.<p>
Third, conference participants discussed migration issues with Japanese
employers, unauthorized workers, and local officials in areas where, in one
city, almost 10 percent of the population were foreigners.<p>
There are 1.32 million foreigners in Japan, making them 1.1 percent of the
total population. <p>
These field trips provided several insights.  First, immigration and
integration policies are being made locally in Japan, as local officials react
in an ad hoc manner to events that arise when foreigners and foreign workers
are present.  They prepare booklets in e.g., Portuguese and Japanese on how to
separate garbage for pickup, and establish bilingual classes to accommodate
foreign students.  <p>
Local officials seem to be aware that Japanese immigration policy is to avoid
the settlement of foreigners, but they nonetheless are implementing policies
that make it easier for foreigners and their children to settle in Japan,
including the provision of Japanese language classes and the support of
Japanese-foreigners associations for Nikkeijin, the mostly Brazilian and
Peruvian workers of Japanese descent who get three-year work permits to enter
Japan.<p>
Private organizations are also being established to help foreigners.  The All
United Workers Union has opened a hall in Ueno, Tokyo where about 40 foreigners
working for small manufacturing companies can get help and advice in Urdu,
Bengali and French--the workers are from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Senegal.
About 900 non-Japanese workers are dues-paying members of the Tokyo-based
union.<p>
Second, foreign workers are to some extent a structural feature of the Japanese
economy and labor market--the number of foreigners in at least some industries
and areas is increasing along with the unemployment rate, as especially young
Japanese workers avoid so-called 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult.  <p>
Unemployment in Japan reached 3.2 percent in 1995, for an average 2.1 million
unemployed workers--youth unemployment reached 6.1 percent.<p>
There appears to be very little enforcement of employer sanctions--at least
some of the employers who hire unauthorized workers do so fairly openly, and
report that they do not fear visits or fines from labor or immigration
inspectors.<p>
A June 1995 survey of 1,731 companies in the Tokyo Metropolitan area found that
17 percent of respondents had foreign workers on their payrolls, up from six
percent in 1991.<p>
Third, immigration policy is closely linked in the minds of local government
officials and employers to industrial policy.  Foreign trainees are meant to
serve as a bridge to foreign investment to e.g., China and Indonesia,
especially for small firms that do not have a foreign presence.  <p>
The aging Japanese industrial work force is training young foreigners in Japan,
helping industries from garments to machinery preserve production in Japan in
the short run and, since most of the trainees return to their countries of
origin, to show local workers how to do things the Japanese way if the Japanese
establish a local facility in the cities from which they come.<p>
Most foreigners holding unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in Japan appear to be
either Brazilians of Japanese descent who get three-year permits to live and
work in Japan, trainees from nearby Asian nations, or unauthorized foreign
workers.  The ethnic Japanese from South America are treated as Japanese
workers, participating in Social Security and other labor market programs, and
paid the same as Japanese workers doing similar work.<p>
The trainees, on the other hand, reportedly cost a Japanese employer the same
150,000 yen ($1500) per month that a Japanese high school graduate would cost,
but the composition of the employer's cost of labor is very different for
foreign trainees.  Trainees in one city receive a cash allowance about $400 per
month, and $200 per month for food.  The other $900 represent costs the
employer incurs for transportation, housing, fees, and clothing.  In some
cases, trainees pay kickbacks to their sending organization from their
allowance, such as to a public organization in China.<p>
In early February, Japan intercepted 60 Chinese trying to sneak into
southwestern Japan.  The captain of the ship had charged the workers 180,000 to
210,000 yuan ($21,000 to $24,500) to be smuggled into Japan.<p>
The number of foreign students enrolled in Japanese universities and technical
schools was 53,847 in May 1995, including 45,245 who were studying in Japan at
their own expense.  Foreign students in Japan are permitted to work 28 hours
per week.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC17">Singapore:
Debate on Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></a></a></h2>
During a debate on the budget on March 20, several members of the Singapore
House of Representatives raised the issue of deregulating the employment of
foreign workers.  Singapore's labor minister responded that the government
needed to control foreign workers in Singapore to balance their employment
against long-term national interests.  The prolonged use of foreign workers, he
asserted, could have adverse economic, social and political effects. <p>
During the debate, the labor minister argued that continued access to foreign
workers could discourage employers from training local workers and upgrading
their operations.  He encouraged employers to find innovative ways to overcome
manpower shortages, and rejected calls to eliminate the foreign worker levy and
the limits on the number of foreign workers allowed in various sectors.  <p>
The government also rejected a proposal to establish a minimum wage for foreign
workers, saying it could result in unrealistic labor costs for employers and
undermine the country's competitiveness. <p>
The number of foreign workers in Singapore jumped from 70,000 in 1975 to
350,000 today.  The share of foreigners in the work force rose from seven
percent in 1975 to 20 percent of the 1.7 million workers in the country in
1995. <p>
Despite tight controls, the number of foreigners overstaying their visas is
also climbing.  In 1993, 6,000 remained past their expiration date, in 1994,
the figure jumped to 7,000, and between January and October, 1995, over 5,000.
<p>
An estimated 10,000 aliens annually are smuggled into Singapore, usually by
smugglers who provide them with false passports.  According to Singapore's
immigration department, counterfeit social visit passes, which previously cost
about S$100, are now so readily available that the price has dropped to S$10.
<p>
Construction is a major employer of legal and illegal foreign workers.  In
construction, employers may have up to five foreign workers for every one
Singaporean, provided they pay a monthly levy for each foreign worker-- S$200
(US $141) for a skilled worker, and S$440 for an unskilled worker.  <p>
The Employment of Foreign Workers Act took effect late in 1995, and it
penalizes labor contractors between S$15,000 (about $10,700) and S$30,000, or
jail for a term of not more than one year, or both.  There is also a fine of
between S$50,000 ($35,700) and S$100,000 for employers who have committed
immigration offenses that are punishable with mandatory jail or caning.
Illegal workers are also fined: up to S$5,000 or imprisonment of up to one
year, or both. <p>
Under the new law, foreigners who overstay their visas for more than 90 days,
or who enter Singapore without a valid travel document, can be punished with
three strokes of the cane, as can employers found with five or more illegal
workers.<p>
In the past, many construction contractors claimed that they did not know that
their subcontractors were using illegal workers.  The new law helps identify
the main contractor who was previously protected by sub-contractors.<p>
On March 14, a subcontractor was sentenced to eight months' jail for illegally
hiring 105 foreign workers at two construction sites in 1995.  This was the
first case involving a single employer caught for employing a large number of
illegal workers. <p>
The number of employers prosecuted for employing illegal workers rose from 31
per month in 1994 to 43 per month in 1995.  About 750 illegal aliens are
apprehended each month in Singapore.<p>
Singapore is one of the world's richest "developing" nations, with a per capita
GDP of $24,000, higher than that of the UK, and roughly equivalent to
France--its three million people had a 1995 GDP of about $82 billion.  However,
only about three percent of the country's workers have a college degree or
more, although the government notes that almost one-fourth of the new entrants
to the work force have college degrees.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">Hong
Kong</a>/a></a>
and the UK</a>
</a></h2>
British Prime Minister John Major announced on March 4 that Hong Kong residents
with blue-covered Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) travel documents
will be able to enter Britain without visas for up to six months, but will not
have the right of abode or to work.  Some Tory MPs feel that the UK faces an
illegal immigration "nightmare," since, they argue, the UK is really admitting
mainland Chinese without visas.<p>
Singapore and South Africa are expected to follow the UK's lead and permit
visa-free entry with SAR documents.<p>
Many Hong Kong residents nonetheless waited long hours near the end of March to
obtain British National Overseas passports, which they thought would make
future international travel easier--80 countries allow visa-free entry to BNO
passport holders.  March 31,1996 was the last day for Hong Kong residents to
obtain British National Overseas passports.  There is a limit of 3.3 million
BNO passports that can be issued to Hong Kong's 6.3 million residents.<p>
Major also announced that Hong Kong's ethnic minorities, primarily Indians and
Pakistanis, would be guaranteed the right to live in Britain after the turnover
if they came "under pressure to leave Hong Kong." <p>
A total of 90,000 Hong Kong residents applied for<b> </b>naturalization in the
UK in March, compared with 34,500 in all of 1995 and 18,000 in 1994.  <p>
Hong Kong residents are permitted under US law to defer immigrating to the US
until 2002.  In 1995, about 39 percent of those who received immigration visas
elected to defer migrating.<p>
Australia estimates that there are 220,000 multiple entry visitor visa holders
from Hong Kong in Australia at any one time, eligible to stay up to one year,
and that, in 1997, some may stay and request asylum.<p>
In 1994, the Fiji government invited up to 28,000 Hong Kong Chinese to
immigrate, a move opposed by 76 percent of both native Fijians and Indians.
Most Fijians are Methodists, and the Methodist church is leading the opposition
to the plan to admit Hong Kong Chinese, arguing that the Chinese will bring
drugs and prostitution to the island.<p>
Under the plan, Hong Kong residents who wish to immigrate would have to pay
$30,000 per family, and invest at least $100,000 in Fiji.  Cynics think the
corrupt government ministers want to pocket the fees.<p>
Easy access to Shenzhen, China, a special economic zone set up 16 years ago to
help industrialize the mainland, has led to a restructuring of the Hong Kong
economy.  Manufacturing firms such as Hitachi are relocating to China for
cheaper land and labor.  Only an hour from Hong Kong, more than 150,000 Hong
Kong nationals earn their living in the Shenzhen region of China.<p>
Shenzhen residents have the highest average monthly salaries in China (about
$450), about twice monthly earnings in Beijing.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Korea</a>'s
Foreign
Trainees</a>/a></a></h2>
In February 1996, the quota for foreign trainees in South Korea increased to
70,000.  By the end of February, some 50,000 foreign trainees were in Korea.
They receive basic training; most work in small manufacturing companies for one
year.  <p>
The government has developed several strategies to help small businesses deal
with labor shortages.  Small businesses with less than 50 employees are allowed
to have a work force composed of up to 20 percent foreigners, up from the
previous 10 percent foreigners ceiling.  The government also assigns some young
Korean men to small businesses in lieu of military duty--some 15,000 Koreans
were assigned to small business in 1996.<p>
Foreigners will be recruited to work on fishing vessels in South Korea for the
first half of 1996 in order to alleviate labor shortages.  About 1,000
foreigners workers will be placed aboard fishing vessels on a trial basis.  The
number of offshore fishing workers is expected to fall 10,500 short of the
51,500 needed.<p>
The labor shortage, which peaked in 1991, was caused by reduced birth rate,
exhaustion of the rural labor surplus, and the declining labor force
participation of the young, more of whom are studying longer.<p>
There are approximately 84,000 illegal workers in Korea.<p>
There are three types of illegal foreign worker in South Korea.  The most
common arrives with a short-term visa, such as a tourist visa, and remains
illegally in the country to work.  The second type enters South Korea with a
fraudulent passport or is smuggled in.  The third type enters legally as a
trainee, and either overstays the trainee visa, or illegally changes jobs.<p>
The South Korean government is currently considering the passage of the Foreign
Employment Act, which will address some of the legal and social issues that
arise with foreign workers.  But the government warned that it will take
several years of study before the legislation can be approved and implemented.

Experiences
Immigration</a><a></a></a></h2>
Some of North Korea's 22 million residents are reportedly crossing the Yalu
river into China because of food shortages.  China's Jilin province includes
large numbers of ethnic Koreans, and the Yalu river is shallow enough that
people can wade across.<p>
China's missile tests in the Taiwan strait led to numerous ads in Taipei
newspapers offering, e.g., " missile protection passports" for T$100,000"
($3,600), or permanent residency in Costa Rica within 60 days.  So-called
immigration fairs drew 30,000 to 40,000 people in March.  About 20,000
Taiwanese emigrate each year to the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa.  However, more Taiwanese have reportedly "bought
protection" by acquiring passports from Dominica, the Seychelles, Vanuatu,
Belize, Namibia and Costa Rica.<p>
China's population rose by 12.7 million in 1995; China's goal is to keep its
population to 1.3 billion by 2000.  There are 10 countries with more than 100
million residents, and two--the US and Japan--are among the world's wealthiest.
China has 30 provinces, 19 of which have more than 30 million residents.<p>
China's gross domestic product GDP in 1995 was 5,773.3 billion yuan.  Income
gaps between provinces are widening.  The coastal areas of Shanghai and
Guangdong had per capita incomes of $800 in 1992, versus $225 in Guizhou.
There are about 230 million residents in the rich southeast coastal area, and
530 million in the poorer center.<p>
China classifies its urban households into five categories, from the poorest,
who have annual incomes of less than 5,000 yuan ($600) and who comprise eight
percent of households, to the next group--who have annual incomes between 5,000
and 15,000 yuan ($600-$1,800)--and who comprise 30 percent of urban households,
to the 53 percent of all urban households that have annual incomes between
15,000-30,000 yuan ($1,800-$3,600), to the high income households that have
annual incomes of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan ($3,600-$12,000)--who are six percent
of all households, to the very high income households, who have more than
100,000 yuan annually ($12,000)--and are three percent of all households.<p>
About one-fourth of China's 1.2 billion people are considered urban residents.
<p>
There are believed to be about 35 million ethnic Chinese outside mainland
China, or 55 million if Taiwan is included.  These overseas ethnic Chinese are
believed to account for some 70 percent of the more than $ 490 billion in
foreign investments in mainland China.  Overseas Chinese have been described as
"Lords of the Rim: The Invisible Empire of the Overseas Chinese," and "The
Merchant Mandarins."<p>
China elaborated on plans announced earlier to "preserve jobs in China for the
Chinese."  Urban unemployment is estimated to be at least 10 percent, far
higher than the three percent official rate.<p>
The US Human Rights Report on China, issued in March 1996, notes that there is
a "floating population" of over 100 million economic migrants within China.
China also responded to US charges that it is swamping Tibet with Chinese
immigrants by arguing that, in 1995, there were 79,000 Chinese Han people among
Tibet's 2.4 million residents.<p>
In the US, the 98 Chinese Golden Venture passengers still in detention may be
able to apply for political asylum in the U.S after the House approved a
House-Senate conference report that would amend the Immigration and Nationality
Act to allow people who fear "coercive population controls" in their home
country to seek asylum in the U.S.  <p>
Vietnam announced in March that there are 2.6 million ethnic Vietnamese in 80
countries, including one million in the US, about 400,000 in France, 300,000 in
China, 160,000 in Australia, 150,000 in Canada, 120,000 in Thailand and 100,000
each in Germany, Cambodia and Russia.<p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Thailand</a>:
 Foreign Worker</a>
Zones</a>
</a></h2>
The Federation of Thai Industries proposed the creation of a special economic
zone which would allow foreigners to work without a minimum wage requirement.
One zone being considered is for the provinces near the borders of Cambodia and
Myanmar.  <p>
The proposal would also allow foreigners full ownership in businesses in the
zone.  Current rules allow foreigners to own no more than 40 percent of an
enterprise.  Most products produced in the special economic zone would be for
export. <p>
The Thai House committee on military affairs believes that the presence of over
two million illegal foreign workers in the country poses a security threat.
Most of the foreign workers are from Myanmar (formerly Burma); the committee
spokesperson asserts they are sent to act as spies in Thailand.<p>
On March 20, the Thai House of Representatives considered a proposal to allow
foreign workers to work on Thai fishing vessels.  The bill is aimed at
alleviating a shortage of crewmen on fishing boats.  Many of the workers come
from Myanmar (Burma) or Cambodia. <p>
After five Thai workers were executed for murder and robbery in Singapore in
mid-March, the Thai justice ministry is considering posting legal advisors
abroad to protect Thai overseas workers.  The reaction to the killings in
Thailand was muted, although the government was criticized for not protecting
overseas workers.  Press reports initially expected a furor similar to that
when the Singapore government executed a Filipino maid last year. <p>

 Too Many
Foreign</a><a></a>ers?</a>
</a></h2>
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with a labor force growing
by almost two million per year, is worried that too many "good jobs" are going
to foreigners.  In 1995, the number of foreign workers increased 38 percent, to
57,000.<p>
Most foreigners in Indonesia are professional expatriates who earn $4,000 per
month or more.  The government reports that expatriate workers in 1995 earned a
total $2.4 billion, equivalent to one-third of the country's current account
deficit of $7.9 billion.  <p>
There are over 11,000 South Koreans working in Indonesia, 9,000 Japanese and
5,000 Taiwanese.  Currently, Indonesian companies can only hire foreign workers
for jobs requiring professional skills not possessed by locals.  On March 23,
the government announced plans to allow foreigners to work in positions which
have previously been closed to them such as high and middle-level management.
The government hopes that the new, shorter list will attract more foreign
investment in Indonesia. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC23">ILO
Report on Migrant
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
The International Labour Office in Geneva released a report on March 6 about
the deteriorating working conditions of migrant workers in East Asia and the
Middle East. <p>
The report was released at a meeting of government officials, employers and
trade unions from more than 30 countries who met at the ILO's Geneva
headquarters the week of March 4 to discuss international labor standards for
construction workers.  During the meeting, the representatives discussed how
the government of labor-sending countries can protect their overseas workers.
Labor importing countries were accused of failing to enforce their labor laws
regarding migrant workers. <p>
In the report, the ILO found that the wages and benefits of foreign workers are
typically below those paid to local workers.  In Bahrain, for example, wages
for construction workers fell by as much as one third between 1986 and 1989.<p>
The ILO report found that wages vary considerably.  A survey of wages paid by
Korean construction firms in the Middle East in 1992 revealed, for example,
that Malaysians earned the most, US$536 per month, followed by Filipinos and
Thais.  At the bottom of the scale were Sri Lankans, at US$38 per month.  Wages
for foreign construction workers are higher in Asia than the Middle East.<p>
The failure of many countries to recognize their dependence on foreign workers
has led to many migrants working illegally, and thus they do not complain of
safety violations.  <p>
A survey of Asia in the Economist assumes that labor shortages throughout the
region will have some inflationary effect, and that continued labor shortages
will act as brake on economic growth.  The article concludes that the companies
that succeed in Asia on a large scale will be those that can build their own
infrastructure and distribution systems and recruit and retain the best
employees.  <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC25">Israel</a>
Replaces
Palestinians</a>/a></a></h2>
After a three-week ban on Palestinians entering Israel due to a series of
suicide bombings, the government announced on March 24 that it was easing its
closure of the West Bank and Gaza.  <p>
Only Palestinians working in Jewish settlements in the territories will be able
to return to their jobs, and Palestinian patients will be allowed to seek
treatment in Israeli hospitals.  However, most Palestinians will continue to be
indefinitely barred from their jobs in Israel. <p>
During the periodic bans on Palestinian workers over the past year, Thai,
Romanian and Chinese workers were brought in to work in the fields and
construction sites throughout Israel.  More than 60,000 Palestinians are
authorized to work in Israel, and about 40,000 more work in Israel illegally.
<p>
In mid-March, the Israeli government approved the admission of 16,500 new
foreign workers to replace the banned Palestinian workers, bringing the total
to 90,000 legal workers and another 50,000 to 100,000 illegal foreign
workers.<p>
On March 19, the first of the new foreign workers were flown in from Thailand.
The 238 farm laborers will pick oranges, vegetables and flowers. <p>
With nearly one in ten worker a non-Israeli, the country's labor minister
warned that if the number of foreign workers continues to increase, Israel will
experience some of the same problems facing western Europe.  An immigration
absorption expert from Tel Aviv University predicted that, if foreign workers
eventually bring their families, there may be a xenophobic reaction.  <p>
Some foreign workers in Israel live in poor conditions, often without water or
adequate sanitation.  The city of Raanana, north of Tel Aviv, issued a ban in
March on renting housing to foreign workers. <p>
Most foreign workers are recruited in their home countries by Israeli
intermediaries and are paid less than the legal minimum wage--about $600 per
month compared with $1,500 per month.  Most foreigners have one-year work
contracts.  <p>
In 1995, foreign workers remitted about $470 million to their countries of
origin.  <p>
The West Bank and Gaza depend on the Israeli economy for jobs and sales--Israel
puts the daily dependence at $2 million per day, the Palestinians at $3 million
per day in wages and jobs, and another $6 million in indirect sales that result
from the expenditure of wages earned in Israel.<p>
Israel's economy is about 30 times that of the West Bank and Gaza, and until
recently about one-fourth of the Palestinian labor force of 280,000 worked in
Israel, usually in construction for about $35 per day.<p>
Palestinian officials said on March 24 that they are trying to establish
worldwide trade accords to lessen the area's dependence upon Israel.  A
Palestinian delegation is planning to negotiate trade accords with other Arab

The US has agreed to provide $110 million worth of equipment to help Israel
build and monitor a 124-mile fence to separate the West Bank from Israel.   The
fence is designed to prevent terrorism and "illegal immigration" from the
territory controlled by the Palestinian authority.<p>
Israel has received about 700,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union since
1989.  Per capita income reached $15,500 in 1995 -- equal to that of Spain,
Ireland and New Zealand.<p>

in New Zealand
Elections</a></a</a></h2>
The head of the New Zealand First Party proposed on February 21 that immigrants
have a four-year probationary period to prove their commitment to the country.
Immigrant residents would be restricted to 24.9 percent ownership of New
Zealand companies, and would not be allowed to buy land, other than that on
which their home and business are sited.  <p>
First Party leader Winston Peters said that New Zealand wanted immigrants who
were committed to the country, and would make a contribution to New Zealand,
but not wealthy people who would spend most of their time overseas.  New
Zealand first has only 3 seats in the 99 person Parliament, but 17 percent
support in opinion polls.<p>
The Labour Party leader criticized Peters for his anti-immigrant views but
blamed the government for creating the climate for such sentiment.  The
government, she said, has allowed in sharp increase in immigration without
being prepared for the influx.<p>
Some Maoris fear that wealthy Asians settling in New Zealand will purchase much
of the country, jeopardizing tribal land settlement that dates back to European
colonization last century. <p>
A recent survey found that 51 percent of the voters believe New Zealand has too
many Asians, even though they make up less than 0.5 percent of its 3.5 million
people. <p>
