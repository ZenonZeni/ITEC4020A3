<blockquote>

(Burnaby, October 1996)<P>

<B>Quick!</B> Charles Krebs is an expert on: 1. Why bears hibernate,
2. Why male penguins hatch the egg, 3. Why lemmings commit mass
suicide or 4. Why birds migrate to the Arctic?<A
href="#answer"><B>*</B></A><P>

On October 18, to start off Canada's National Science and Technology Week,
hundreds of people puzzled over such questions. About 40 registered to
track their scores on the quiz at the Great Canadian Scientists website
(www.science.ca). The six top scorers got Great Canadian Scientists
t-shirts and CD-ROMs.<P>

The winners were:<BR>
1. Ashleigh Cheung (13, Vancouver, BC), 2. Scott MacIntyre (39, Dartmouth,
Nova Scotia), 3. Roger Leeman (~25, Zurich, Switzerland), 4. Nancy
Broughton (~25, Chicago, Illinois), 5. Micheline Villeneuve (~30, Orleans,
Ontario), and 6. Louis Moreau (27, Quebec, Quebec)<P>

Barry Shell, the project's creator says, "I think it's great that people in
Switzerland and Chicago could play alongside Canadians at home." The GCS
Quiz and website show that the Internet is a very effective medium for the
promotion of Canadian excellence abroad.<P>

Several things about the winners are of interest. They are from sea to
shining sea; Nova Scotia to BC. There was an even 50/50 split of male and
female winners. A Chinese Canadian was the top scorer. Two French Canadians
are in the winners list. Of the two outside Canada, one is a Canadian PhD
student studying in Chicago. The other is a Swiss fellow who just likes
Canada. Interestingly, the age range of the winners shows that the site is
mainly being used by adults; often to assist children with learning, but
usually for their own interest.<P>

The results are particularly striking because they show that the
Internet is becoming more open and accessible. No longer is it solely
the domain of male nerds and hackers. Instead a cross section of
Canadians was represented in the winners circle. They *are* all
certainly predisposed to science and technology, however, with a
science wiz kid in Vancouver, a professional engineer in Nova Scotia,
a Chemistry PhD student in Chicago, and an Industry Canada employee in
Ottawa.<P>

The quiz was programmed by <A HREF="http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gord.html">Gordon Ross</A>, a 4th year Communication student at
Simon Fraser University where the Great Canadian Scientists website makes
its home.<P>

By the way, anyone in the world can play the quiz at anytime by going
to <A HREF="http://www.science.ca">www.science.ca</A>. Find out once
and for all if lemmings really do throw themselves off cliffs.<P>

<A NAME="answer">
*ANSWER: Charles Krebs is one of the world's leading Ecologists. He wrote the
 most widely used textbook, "Ecology", and he is an expert on why lemmings
 commit mass suicide.<P>
