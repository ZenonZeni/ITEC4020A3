Seasonal Affective Depression (SAD) affects millions of people, yet is very misunderstood.  The disorder is as basic as its name:  seasonal changes impact our affect (emotions).  Many people notice changes in sleep patterns, hunger level, and mood swings when Fall starts turning into Winter.  These personal changes aren't weird -- they're biological!<p>
In 1980, Alfred Lewy and other researchers found that bright light decreases pineal gland function and darkness accelerates it.  The pineal gland is a small organ located deep in the brain.  The gland secretes the hormone melatonin, which times the onset of puberty, stimulates sleep, and influences mood levels.<p>
You might notice that in the summer, you feel comfortable, happy, and relaxed.  However, as the days get shorter and cloudy, you begin to feel less content...grumpy even. This could be a sign that you have SAD.<p>
One means to deal with SAD is to increase your exposure to natural (not suntan booth!) light.  In severe SAD cases, doctors have been known to prescribe special lamps that mimic natural light.  Also, increase your physical stimulation.  The natural mix would be to do moderate (i.e., walking or light cycling) exercise outside.  However, even on cloudy days, moderate exercise indoors can help with SAD.  You can also look at your diet.  If you are eating heavy foods (pastas, greasy foods, lots of starches) and no lighter foods such as fruits and vegetables, you could be depriving your body of a means of getting vitamins normally obtained through your "summer" diet and activities.  If you try increasing your time outdoors, improving your diet and exercise, and your mood still does not improve, you might consider seeking professional assistance.  Talking with a counselor can help normalize your feelings and help you identify means to improve your mood.  Also, some doctors consider prescribing temporary medications to help people affected with SAD make it through the Winter season.<p><p>

<center><H2>Understanding Anxiety and Panic Disorder</H2></center><p>
Have you ever had that feeling of a racing heart, sweating though your clammy, racing speech, stomach upset, and disconnected thought patterns?  No, I'm not describing that "love at first sight" feeling, I'm describing common symptoms of a panic attack.<p>
Many of us have had the experience of being scared -- the adrenaline rush of surprise, but some of us suffer from something more severe:  panic disorder.  Usually diagnosed when we're in our mid to late 20s, panic disorder ranges in severity from mildly interfering in our lives to majorly putting us out of commission.  Here are some common symptoms of anxiety and panic disorder:
<ul>
<li>experiencing sudden episodes of intense and overwhelming fear for no apparent reason
<li>during these episodes, having the urge to flee, or the feeling you need to escape
<li>thinking, during these episodes, that you might die, have a heart attack, lose control, or embarrass 	yourself
<li>worry about these episodes or fear they will happen again
<li>fear of episodes causes you to avoid places or situations that you think might trigger the attack
<li>experiencing several of these symptoms during an episode: racing, pounding, or skipping heartbeat; chest pain, pressure, or discomfort; difficulty catching your breath; choking sensation or lump in your throat; excessive sweating; lightheadedness or dizziness; nausea or stomach problems; tingling or numbness in parts of your body; chills or hot flashes; shaking or trembling; feelings of unreality or being detached from your body.
</ul><p>
If you find that many of these symptoms apply to you, you could be suffering from panic disorder.  If so, you are not alone.  More than three million American adults have, or will have, panic disorder.  The good news is that effective treatments are available and can offer substantial relief in 70 to 90 percent of people suffering from panic disorder.<p>
