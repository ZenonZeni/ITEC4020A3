CIBC
Mr. Paul T. Fisher, V.P. & Corporate Secretary
Commerce Court, Toronto, ON M5L 1A2, Canada
tel.: 416 980-3095; fax: 416 980 7012.

Listed Exchange(s):  Montreal

Business:   CIBC is a broadly based Canadian financial services  company
operating  on  a global basis.  In terms of assets, it is one  of  North
America's   largest   financial  institutions.   CIBC's   Personal   and
Commercial Bank provides a full range of financial services to 6,000,000
individuals,  farmers  and  businesses across Canada.   It  also  serves
retail  customers through one of the largest financial networks  in  the
West Indies and through private banking centers around the world.   CIBC
Wood  Gundy  offers  a  wide spectrum  of  credit  and  capital  markets
capabilities  to  several thousand corporate clients  and  institutional
investors  worldwide.   In  addition,  it  provides  a  wide  range   of
investment  services to individuals.  Employees throughout the group  of
companies  are  dedicated to building long-term relationships  with  all
CIBC  customers.   CIBC helps individuals and businesses  achieve  their
visions by anticipating and meeting their changing needs, and delivering
integrated  solutions.  This is how CIBC ultimately enhances  value  for
its shareholders.

News:   CIBC  became  stronger  in almost every  respect  in  1994.   It
generated  higher revenue growth and record earnings, and  significantly
improved  the  quality of its balance sheet.  CIBC  also  developed  and
refined its business strategies to ensure long-term growth and drive  it
toward its goal of becoming the pre-eminent Canadian financial  services
company.

Revenues  grew across the organization, reflecting gains in  traditional
product  lines as well as efforts to diversify sources of  income.   Net
income increased to $890 million, up from $730 million last year.   CIBC
achieved  record  net income of $255 million for the 1st  quarter  ended
January 31, 1995, an increase of $41 million or 19% from the same period
a  year ago and $19 million or 8% from the previous  quarter.   Earnings
per  share  increased to $3.52 from $2.99 last year.  Return  on  equity
climbed  to  11.7%  compared with 10.6% in fiscal 1993.   At  year  end,
CIBC's balance sheet and capital ratios were the strongest they've  been
in  many  years.   It  strengthened  the  balance  sheet  by  increasing
liquidity and improving the quality of the lending portfolio.  The level
of net non-performing loans decreased to $1.5 billion from $2.4  billion
the   previous   year.   In  the  last  year,   CIBC   accelerated   its
transformation into a broadly-based financial services company.

It  strengthened  the  core  franchise  and  moved  ahead  with  planned
expansions into new businesses and markets.  With the acquisition of The
Personal  Insurance Company of Canada, CIBC gained critical mass in  the
group  insurance  market.   And  the  merger  of  the  CIBC   Investment
Management  Corporation subsidiary with T.A.L. Investment  Counsel  Ltd.
provides  CIBC  with  a majority stake in what is now  one  of  Canada's
largest  institutional  investment managers.  Over the year,  CIBC  also
expanded its trust operations to 26 offices across Canada,  consolidated
a  leading  position in the Canadian credit card market,  added  to  the
volume  of  residential  mortgages and  consumer  loans,  and  increased
lending to small and medium-sized businesses.

OKI ELECTRIC INDUSTRY CO. LTD.
Mr. Minoru Tsukahara
7-12 Toronomon 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105
Japan
tel.: (81) 3 3501 3111; fax: (81) 3 3581 5522.

Exchange(s):  Tokyo; Osaka.

Business:    Oki   Electric  Industry  Company  Limited  is   a   global
manufacturer  and marketer of leading-edge  telecommunications  systems,
information processing systems and electronic devices.

Spanning  more  than 11 decades, Oki Electric has imbued  a  progressive
spirit  of  enterprise into market-winning products and  services.   The
Company's  integrating  concept is People to  People  Technology,  which
embraces  multimedia, human interface systems and electronic devices  to
enhance communications worldwide.

Oki Electric is a responsible corporate citizen that contributes to  the
well-being of its host communities around the world.

The  Company  was founded in January 1881 and  established  in  November
1949.

News:   August  1995  Message from the  President  and  Chief  Executive
Officer, Mr. Jun Jinguji:

"Oki  Electric  attained consolidated net sales of yen657.0  billion  in
fiscal  1994, ended March 31, 1995.  Up 0.8% from a year  earlier,  this
result reflected increased demand for telecommunications  infrastructure
and  for semiconductors used in personal computers (PCs).   However,  we
improved our bottom line dramatically, recording a net income of yen32.3
billion,  or  yen52.70  per share, compared with a net  loss  of  yen1.8
billion, or yen2.85 per share, the previous period.  In fiscal 1995,  we
expect once again to achieve net sales on the order of yen650.0  billion
despite the strong yen and moderate outlook for economic growth.

"We  have  rebounded  from  our  fiscal  1992  low  by  implementing   a
restructuring plan from April 1993 that reorganized production,  sharply
reduced fixed costs and converted the operations for select  high-volume
products into separate entities.  Our printer and facsimile  operations,
for  example,  were established as an independent subsidiary,  Oki  Data
Corp.,  on October 1, 1994.  Our firm results for this year are  largely
attributable to the success of these restructuring measures.  To sustain
momentum and stabilize profitability, we are starting a second phase  of
the plan in fiscal 1995, aimed at further refining operating efficiency,
consolidating resources and focusing on select businesses.  We intend to
mobilize  Oki Electric's progressive spirit and corporate  strengths  to
realize the virtually unlimited opportunities of the emerging multimedia
era.

"Multimedia  systems  offer  robust  growth  potential  and  utilize Oki
Electric's  strengths,  making  them  a prime  focus  for  the  Company.
Advancing  in  this direction, we became an equity  partner  in  General
Magic,  Inc., a leading communications alliance, in December  1994.   We
are  using  its platform technologies to develop  innovative  multimedia
communications terminal systems.  We also launched sales of asynchronous
transfer mode switching systems and related products.  By  participating
in  numerous  service  trials,  we are  striving  to  commercialize  new
applications that will help determine the future shape of the multimedia
society.

"In recent years, demand for large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs)  has
grown with the expansion of the markets for PCs, peripherals and  mobile
communications equipment.  To respond to this demand, we completed Phase
1  construction  of  manufacturing facilities for  LSIs  at  Miyagi  Oki
Electric Co., in fiscal 1994 and scheduled production to commence in the
first quarter of 1996.

"The approaching 21st century is often described as the Age of Asia.  In
recognition  of the region's potential, we plan to expand  our  regional
production  and  marketing presence.  We have started  this  process  by
reinforcing our marketing and service network throughout Asia.

"Oki Electric has undergone a successful revitalization in the past  two
fiscal  years.   Our  task over fiscal 1995  is  to  further  streamline
operations, focus on key business segments and develop new  capabilities
to create a secure foundation for growth well into the 21st Century."

Business:  Global banking and financial services.

           assets      101,001,800      (group: 104,031,500)
           liabilities 101,001,800      (group: 104,031,500)

News:  Postipankki has 5,761 employees; was established in 1886  and  is
the  third  largest  commercial bank in Finland.   In  addition  to  its
extensive domestic network and advanced payment systems, the Bank has an
international  network with branches in London, New York  and  Singapore
and  representative offices in Stockholm, Moscow and Tokyo.  Moreover  a
worldwide   network  of  correspondent  banks  in  the  most   important
industrial  and  business  centers ensures the speedy  handling  of  the
bank's  international business.  After suffering a prolonged  recession,
the Finnish economy took a turn for the better in 1993.  Though domestic
demand  continued to decline, exports embarked on an energetic  upswing.
The value of the markka weakened early in the year, but the unexpectedly
fast  decrease  in the current account deficit, mainly  due  to  Finnish
companies'  success  on  export markets,  gradually  began  to  generate
expectations  of  a revaluation.  The Postipankki Group  performed  much
better in 1993 than in 1992, but still showed a loss.  The  consolidated
operating  loss was FIM 354 million, i.e., FIM 287 million less than  in
1992.    Postipankki   Ltd's  operating  loss  was  FIM   372   million.
Consolidated net income from financial operations rose 12% to FIM  3,032
million,  against a mere 2% rise in 1992.  Net interest income stood  at
FIM 2,567 million, up 17% compared with the previous year's 4%.

           liabilities  175,345,000     liabilities   175,491,000

News:    Net  income  nearly tripled between 1993  and  1994  to  $1,169
million.   A significant factor behind the improved 1994 earnings was  a
$930  million, or more than 50%, reduction in the provision  for  credit
losses  and a 36% reduction in net non-accrual loans from  1993  levels.
Cost  control  initiatives  included  the  reduction  of  complement  by
approximately  3,500  employees and the closure of  130  branches.   The
integration  of  Royal  Trust which was acquired  in  1993  was  largely
completed on schedule and on budget.  Assets under administration in the
bank's  mutual fund business grew 25% from 1993, making Royal  Bank  the
second  largest  provider of retail mutual funds in  Canada.   The  bank
helped   create   a   new   world  class   venture   fund   to   support
commercialization  of  drug  products and devices  to  treat  brain  and
central  nervous system disorders.  As well, $125 million was  committed
to a risk capital fund created to finance the growth of small and medium
size  businesses.   Plans were announced for a telephone  banking  Super
Centre  that will provide customers with faster, more  flexible  service
from  anywhere in the country, 24 hours a day.  During 1994, the  bank's
brokerage  subsidiary, RBC Dominion Securities, recorded net  income  of
$133 million.  Effective November 1, 1994, John Cleghorn was named Chief
Executive  Officer  of Royal Bank, succeeding Mr. Allan  R.  Taylor  who
remains Chairman of the Board until the bank's annual meeting on January
26, 1995.
