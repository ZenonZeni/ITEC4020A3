</CENTER><HR><P><H5>

On July 1, 1992, the College entered into a contract with the San Francisco Department 

of Public Health AIDS Office to provide medical care to people with HIV using acupuncture 

and herbal medicine.  Funding for this contract is provided by the Ryan White Comprehensive

 AIDS Resources Emergency (C.A.R.E.) Act.  The College formed a Community Advisory 

 Committee to provide input and feedback in the development and implementation of the 

 program. <P>

To facilitate this program, the College expanded clinic hours, and hired additional staff 

acupuncturists, including Spanish-speaking bi-cultural practitioners.  The College began

outreach and community education efforts to other AIDS service providers and increased  

the number of HIV+ patient visits from an estimated 65 per month to 250 per month.  

<P>

As a result of these efforts, the College has created a model for Chinese medicine care for 

people with HIV, has delivered this service to San Franciscans in need, and provided an 

outstanding opportunity for faculty and students to study HIV\AIDS and its impact on individuals 

and society.  In addition, the College is developing relationships to other health care providers in 

the local community and around the world.</H5><P>
