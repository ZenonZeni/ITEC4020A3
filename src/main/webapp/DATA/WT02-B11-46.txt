<!-- HER S&AElig;TTES TEKSTEN IND --><b>Social changes</b><br>
During the past 50 years, the Danish society has undergone significant social changes. One of the most important development trends since World War Two has been women’s entry into the labour market, as well as the education system.
<p>
<b>Shift in career choice</b><br>
Particularly in recent years women have entered upon new educational and occupational areas which were previously almost exclusively dominated by men. The traditional norms governing education and career choice are undergoing significant changes as a result of, among other things, information campaigns and media coverage.
<p>
<b>Focus area: Scientific staff</b><br>
Following this development, the Danish government is focusing on the importance of a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff at universities and other higher education institutions.
<p>
A researcher recruitment study from 1993 has shown that there is at present an uneven gender distribution among researchers, and that the proportion of women is lower, the higher they  get in the hierarchy. Thus in 1991 women made up 24%, 17% and 4%, respectively, of the staff at assistant professor, associate professor and full professor level.
<p>
<b>The picture is changing - but slowly<br></b>
Development towards a more even gender distribution has been moderate. There may be several explanations of this. The former recruitment basis, for instance, was much more uneven than is the case today.
<p>
As late as in the mid-80s, two thirds of the graduates were men. Today the picture has changed; in 1991, at 14 out of 19 major higher education institutions women made up 50% or more of the students in 1991. This implies that the future recruitment basis for appointments for scientific posts will to a greater extent consist of women.
<p>
An increasing number of women researchers have found employment in the 1980s financed by external research funds, by research programmes, or in research centres.

<p><b>Increasing number of PhD students</b><br>
Researcher education plays an important role for a more even recruitment. This has had a favourable influence on the proportion of women among PhD students, which has been increasing rapidly in recent years.
<p>
The fact is that the proportion of women who are annually awarded the PhD degree has increased significantly over the past 5 to 6 years. Today, approximately one third of the PhD students are women; however, there are great variations between the fields of study.
<p>
Thus, there is a positive development towards a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff, the qualification requirement for a scientific post being a PhD degree or an equivalent qualification. But renewal of the permanent posts is taking place at a very slow rate. 
<p>
<b>Shortage of new professorships<br></b>
Add to this that throughout the 1970s and 1980s appropriations for the higher education sector have been curbed. This fact, which has led to a shortage of vacancies, is one of the most significant reasons for the slow development. 
<p>
This has in particular manifested itself in the area of full professorships, where for a number of years hardly any vacant jobs have been advertised; this is precisely the area where we have the most uneven gender distribution.
<p>
<b>Research Policy Council’s recommendations<br></b>
With a view to acquiring a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff at the higher education institutions, the Danish Research Policy Council, which is an advisory body to the Danish Government on research matters, has among other things recommended the following:
<ul>

<li>A goal-oriented effort should be made in order to increase the proportion of women researchers at the higher education institutions.
<li>It is largely the responsibility of the institutions, when appointing new staff, to make conscious endeavours to create a more even gender distribution - upon open competition between men and women.

<li>Emphasis should be laid on measures that can stimulate and ensure continuation of the positive development.
<li>The crucial criterion for the appointment of new researchers should be the quality of their research.

<li>Quota systems and positive discrimination of selected groups of applicants do not form the course to be chosen.
<li>Vacancies must be advertised widely and filled with the candidates who have the best qualifications - upon fair competition between men and women.
</ul><p>
It is also of crucial importance to the furthering of a more even gender distribution that women’s interest in research and in a career as a researcher is encouraged - particularly within areas where women have so far been underrepresented, in particular within the fields of technology and the natural sciences.
<p>
<b>Government initiatives<br></b>
In order to further support the positive development towards a more even gender distribution, the Danish government has initiated various actions. Examples worth mentioning are: a significant enlargement of the important PhD scholarship programme (by 600 over a number of years), an increase in the number of professorships, and last but not least, favourable provisions regarding pregnancy leave, of up to 1 year’s duration for women PhD students.
<p>
All things considered, conditions have been established for a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff at the higher education institutions. The Danish government intends to follow this development very closely. But we must realise that changes will only take place gradually over a number of years.
