for Third Quarter</b> </font></p>
<p><strong>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, November 15, 1996 --</strong>
Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. (NASD OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI;
Toronto Stock Exchange: DAH) today reported total revenue of
$47,000, including $33,073 from revenue-sharing from Canadian
sales of its veterinary pharmaceutical Anipryl&#174; for the
three months ended September 30, 1996. DAHI had total revenue of
$12,746, all from investment income, for the comparable three
months of 1995. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., continues to fund research for
additional indications of Anipryl&#174; in geriatric dogs. It
reported a net loss of $582,196, or 8 cents per share based on a
weighted average of 7.5 million shares for the 1996 third
quarter, compared with a net loss of $643,000, or 10 cents per
share based on a weighted average of 6.5 million shares
outstanding for the 1995 third quarter. </p>
<p>The sale of Anipryl&#174; is currently limited to Canadian
veterinarians for the treatment of canine Cushing's disease in
geriatric dogs. The company is seeking approval to market
Anipryl&#174; for the same indication in the U.S., and is seeking
approval for the more common indication of cognitive dysfunction. </p>
<p>Nine months' revenues for 1996 were $937,270, which included
one-time revenues from the sale of distribution rights for
Anipryl&#174; in Canada to Draxis Health Inc. (NASDAQ: DRAXF;
TSE: DAX) and a milestone payment from Hoechst Veterinar GmbH.
The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was
$1.0 million, or 14 cents per share based on a weighted average
of 7.5 million shares outstanding, versus $2.0 million, or 31
cents per share based on 6.5 million shares outstanding for the
nine months ended September 30, 1995. </p>
<p>Anipryl&#174; is being marketed to Canadian veterinarians for
treatment of canine Cushing's disease. Canadian regulators
recently approved two additional dosages of Anipryl&#174;, 10 and
30 milligram, as well as new 30-day blister packaging.
Anipryl&#174; is now approved in Canada in 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30
milligram dosages. </p>
<p>In September 1995, DAHI submitted a new animal drug
application with the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for
treatment of canine Cushing's disease. Approximately 165,000
cases of canine Cushing's disease are diagnosed in geriatric dogs
each year in Canada and the U.S. </p>
<p>DAHI is also awaiting action from the Canadian Health
Protection Branch, Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, on its application
to market Anipryl&#174; for cognitive dysfunction. Approximately
150,000 cases of cognitive dysfunction occur in Canada each year.
The company continues its U.S. Phase III-equivalent clinical
trial for Anipryl&#174; as a treatment for cognitive dysfunction,
which occurs in approximately 1.5 million older dogs each year.</p>
<p>The shareholders of Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., will meet
November 26, 1996, to vote on a friendly offer by Draxis Health
Inc. to acquire the outstanding shares of DAHI that it does not
currently own at an exchange rate of 1.35 Draxis shares for each
outstanding DAHI share. The exchange offer was recommended by an
independent committee of DAHI's board of directors in July 1996.
The proxy materials related to the exchange offer were mailed to
shareholders of both companies in late October. Draxis
shareholders will meet November 25 to vote on the exchange offer.</p>
<p>Draxis currently owns 44 percent of the outstanding common
shares of DAHI, as well as DAHI convertible debt that, if
converted, would result in an increase of Draxis' holdings in
DAHI to 52 percent. </p>
<p>Draxis, based in suburban Toronto, Ontario, is a leading
Canadian pharmaceutical company focused on neurology, dermatology
and veterinary markets in Canada and the United States. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., was established in 1990 to
develop animal health applications for Anipryl&#174;. The Company
is also identifying other animal health product opportunities to
become a multi-product animal health pharmaceutical company.</p>
