<p align="left">The structure proposed in this paper has been
designed and implemented within the framework of the <a
href="/robotics/amadeus.htm">MAST II - AMADEUS</a> Project, whose
aim was to design, construct and test an advanced
non-anthropomorphic manipulator to be used in deep underwater
environments. A series of theoretic studies has been performed at
IAN-CNR in order to understand the global purpose of the Man
Machine Interface (MMI) system; the aim of this activity has been
not only to define the technical specifications of the system,
but also to understand how to maximize its efficiency and how to develop
the most rational <a href="mmi_ar.htm">architecture</a>: a
correct definition of tasks and good designing practice imply the
use of a fully modular structure; In particular, several issues
have been discussed and analyzed to define correctly the most important
MMI requirements: the necessity to deal with information which is
distributed over a series of different machines implies the
implementation of a standard <a href="mmi_com.htm">communication</a>
protocol; the continuous data exchange between modules implies
the use of a well-defined <a href="mmi_dat.htm">data structure</a>.
Synchronization techniques are used, and conflicts are managed by
appropriate regulation mechanisms. The MMI has been designed in a
way that will allow complete reuse for different marine robotics
applications, thanks to the total modularity and flexibility of
its structure; the same way, it grants the possibility of adding
new functionalities or hardware parts to the system, without any
substantial change in the control flow or having to redesign the
global control structure. One of the most meaningful tasks for a
MMI is to understand a human request, no matter what way it is
expressed (mouse, written language, voice, movement of virtual objects...),
interpret it and translate it into a series of commands which can
be used by the controlled machine. The MMI has the peculiarity of
easing manipulation of objects in a hostile environment: in
underwater applications, the possibility of taking accurate
measurements of objects&#146; features and positions (via a
video-camera, for example) is scarce: the <a href="mmi_fot.htm">MMI </a>can
provide the operator with feedback from the manipulator&#146;s
sensors, and give a description of environment and actions
through simulation. </p>
