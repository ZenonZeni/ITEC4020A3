<h3>
<a name="Best Practices">Best Practices in Providing Educational Services in a VE Delivery Model</a></h3>
<P>
Several state level task forces and advisory groups have studied the issues and
practices in regard to the VE model.  In 1986-87,  the Task Force on Education
of Exceptional Students (Varying Exceptionalities) developed a list of best
practices to assist districts.  Recent surveys of VE teachers have indicated
that the majority of teachers feel that these best practices are being
implemented in school districts.  <p>
<p>
<i>1.	</i> <i>A VE model should be used for specific educational
programs.</i><p>
	The Task Force recommended that a VE model may be best utilized at the
prekindergarten or high school level.  Districts have found a VE model
effective for programs such as community-based instruction, vocational
programs, and special diploma programs.<p>
<p>
<i>2.	 A VE model is best utilized for classes and programs where students have
more common curricular needs.</i><p>
<i>	</i>The class size, composition, and educational demands must be taken into
account when using a VE model at any level.  Consideration of the behavior and
academic functioning of students will be critical to the successful use of a VE
model.<p>
<p>
<i>3.</i>	<i>Prior to a student's placement in the VE delivery model, the
potential receiving teacher(s) should have the opportunity to observe the child
in his or her current educational setting or to become familiar with the
child's educational needs.   </i><p>
<i>	</i>This may include access to the student's records, phone conferences, or
other methods of communication when direct observation is not possible.  When
the receiving teacher is well-informed about the needs of the new student,
support services and other accommodations can be provided.<p>
<p>
<i>4.	After a student is placed in a VE class, the appropriateness of the
placement is reviewed within a reasonable amount of time or whenever
requested.</i><p>
<i>	</i>Monitoring the effectiveness of a student's placement should be an
ongoing process.  The review may evaluate the appropriateness of the placement,
given the child's educational needs.  Whenever requested, the staffing team may
reconsider a placement decision and recommend a more appropriate educational
program.<p>
<p>
<i>5.	To the extent possible, full-time and part-time students should be served
in separate classes.</i><p>
<i>	</i>Consideration must be made regarding the educational impact of
combining self-contained students with part-time resource students, who enter
and exit the classroom at differing times during the course of the school
day.<p>
<p>
<i>6.	Instructional aides are provided as needed.  These may include volunteer
assistants as well as paid paraprofessionals.</i><p>
<i>	</i>Teachers need to understand the district policies and procedures for
providing teacher aides.  In addition, participation in the school volunteer
program can be a ready source of help.<p>
<p>
<i>7.	Adequate supplies are provided within existing guidelines to maintain the
quality of the program.</i><p>
<i>	</i>In districts where money for supplies is managed at the school level,
the ESE teachers should become a part of the decision making team.  <p>
<p>
<i>8.	Adequate support services are provided within district guidelines to
maintain the quality of the program.  </i><p>
<i>	</i>Support services should include administrative assistance and related
service personnel, including school psychologists and social workers.<p>
<p>
<i>9.	Parents are well informed about the circumstances in the VE class.</i><p>
<i>	</i>There should be a close working relationship between the parents of an
ESE student in a VE class and the VE teacher.  The parents should be aware of
the characteristics of the class (e.g., class size, functional levels of the
students, etc.) and the availability of support and appropriate services for
their child.  <p>

<i>10.	School or district administrative staff monitor the effectiveness of the
program for students on an individual basis.</i><p>
<i>	</i>The effectiveness of a VE delivery model should be evaluated by looking
at key indicators such as the accomplishments of the students, discipline,
participation in the mainstream, etc. <p>

<h2>
<a name="Sample District Guidelines">Sample District Guidelines for Varying Exceptionalities</a></h2> 

<p>
Local school districts determine how a VE model is to be used to deliver
exceptional student education programs.  In small districts, due to the small
number of students, a VE model may be used to provide a wide range of services.
In middle and large-sized districts in Florida, a VE model may be used either
broadly or only for specific programs or populations.  District policy and
philosophy determine the particular application.  <p>
<p>
In VE classes that are seen as successful, students are grouped according to
similar academic and behavior functioning and needs.  Effective teachers in a
VE model will need to have a strong curriculum background and will also need to
be well-organized, open-minded, flexible, and creative. They must be able to
present knowledge and skills from many different perspectives.  <p>
<p>
The descriptions in this section are provided as illustrations of the ways that
districts have elected to use a VE model in the prekindergarten, elementary,
middle, and secondary programs.    Recommendations regarding the
characteristics of children, provision of aides, or pupil/teacher ratio are
included only as guidelines and are not intended to serve as requirements or
official state policy.  The districts that provided the guidelines are named at
the end of the descriptions.<p>

<h4>
<a name="Prekindergarten Programs">Prekindergarten Programs</a></h4>

<p>
The primary purpose for using the VE model in the prekindergarten program is to
keep students as close to home as possible.  This eliminates long bus rides and
provision of services on an itinerant basis.  The model provides more cost
effective services.<p>
<p>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
Students can be grouped by ability or functioning level, rather than
exceptionality.  Prekindergarten children can be exposed to better role models
in skill areas which may not be their strengths.  They more readily develop
social and language skills from interaction with their peers. <p>
<p>
Children who are 3-5 years of age and developmentally delayed are often
considered for placement in a VE model.  The disability of the child may be
directly interfering with social interaction, and the child may need to be in a
program with children of his or her own age.  The family may benefit from
parent training provided along with the program for the child.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
A pupil/teacher ratio of 8:1 with a full-time paraprofessional or aide is
considered best practice for students in this age group.  The class size should
also consider the needs of the students.  Students who require a great deal of
care and personal support will need to be placed in classes with an even
smaller pupil/teacher ratio or additional teacher aides. <p>
<p>
The classroom program should be staffed by a teacher who is certified in
exceptional student education or early childhood education (as indicated in the
Course Code Directory).   Speech/language pathologists, physical therapists, or
occupational therapists should provide programs and services for children as
appropriate.  The school psychologists and social worker may serve in an
evaluative and consultative capacity and assist parents in accessing local
agencies, if needed. <p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
Planned activities are designed to increase functional skills in all six
developmental areas:  fine motor, gross motor, language, cognitive, self-care,
and social skills.  Skill development is encouraged through
multi-sensory-stimulation and activities such as dressing, pre-speech and
feeding, use of music to facilitate language and movement, and manipulation of
materials for improvement of fine motor skills.  An interdisciplinary team
approach is used in the classroom to support the goals and objectives
formulated in the Individual Educational Plan (IEP) of each child.  <p>

<h4>
<a name="Elementary School">Elementary School <P>Resource Programs</a></h4>

<p>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
Children are grouped in a VE class with other children who have comparable
needs.  They may exhibit delays in individual areas such as language arts,
reading, math, motor skills, and social and personal behaviors.  These students
are mainstreamed for the majority of the school day, and the VE class serves to
provide intervention in the area of the child's greatest need and to provide
support to successful performance in the mainstream class.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
For a resource room, the number of students will be based on the number of
hours each student is seen.  In most cases, 20-30 students can be served in a
resource room.  Sometimes additional students who are fully mainstreamed are
assigned to the ESE teacher for consultation services only.  Each district sets
the caseload requirements for a teaching unit, and actual numbers of students
vary considerably from these recommendations.  Support services are available
from the Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resources System (FDLRS), program
supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,
and curriculum resource personnel in the school. <p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
The schedule in a VE class is determined according to the particular needs of
the students assigned to the class and must be arranged to accommodate the the
schedule of the mainstream classes. In some schools, the VE teacher is using a
team teaching model to provide services in the context of the regular
classroom.<p>
<p>
Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988)  can enhance the success of the
mainstreaming experience of all ESE students.  Through this model, exceptional
education teachers and basic or vocational education teachers join together to
plan needed support and accommodations for exceptional students in mainstream
classes.  Through regular conferences and monitoring, the likelihood of success
of the student is greatly enhanced.  This is particularly critical at the start
of a new school year or when the ESE students are first being included in
mainstream programs.  <p>

<h4><a name="ESelf-Contained Programs">Self-Contained Programs</a></h4>
<P>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
Children are grouped in a VE class with other children who have comparable
needs.  They may exhibit delays in multiple areas such as language arts,
reading, math, motor skills, and social and personal behaviors.  Participation
in mainstream classes is generally limited to art, music, and physical
education for most students.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
For a self-contained class, a 12:1 pupil/teacher ratio  with a full-time aide
or paraprofessional is considered best practice for students in this age group.
Support services are available from FDLRS, program supervisors, school
psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel and curriculum
resource personnel in the school. <p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
The schedule is determined based on the functioning levels and subject areas
needs of the students as well as the scheduling of students for mainstream
classes.  In many programs, ESE students participate in the music, art, and
physical education programs with their chronological peers.  <p>
<p>
In schools with more than one ESE unit, students can be grouped by age range or
by program needs.  Teachers generally feel that emotionally handicapped
students who require full-time services should be placed together. (Polk County
Guidelines)<p>

<h4>
<a name="Middle School">Middle School </a></h4>
<h4>
<a name="MResource Programs">Resource Programs</a></h4>
<P>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
This program is usually designed for mildly handicapped students who do not
require services in all academic areas or intensive related services or therapy
for behavior or emotional handicaps.<p>
<p>
Middle school programs are departmentalized or organized by grade level teams.
Students typically receive instruction from a number of different teachers,
including  those in the exploratory subjects.  The VE teacher may provide
instruction in basic academic classes such as English and mathematics, but
generally the content areas and special areas are taken in the mainstream for
students in resource programs.   If the school has sufficient students and ESE
teachers, faculty assignments may be made by subject area specialization or to
grade level teams.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered best
practice for students in this age group.  Aides and volunteers may be essential
if the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personal
attention.  Support services should be available from FDLRS, program
supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,
and curriculum resource personnel in the school. <p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
The schedule is organized by grade level, subject area, and in some subjects,
by functional level.  The number of VE teachers in the school will affect the
flexibility of the scheduling.  <p>
<p>
In middle schools with grade level teams, VE teachers are sometimes organized
as a separate department, and students are scheduled in their classes on a
pull-out basis.  Other middle schools have found success with placing the VE
teacher on one of the teams and enrolling the ESE students on that team. <p>
<p>
Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of the
mainstreaming experience of all ESE students.  (See Elementary School:
Resource Programs for a description of Cooperative Consultation.)<p>

<p>
<i> Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
This program is usually designed for exceptional students who require services
in the major academic areas and may need some related services or intensive
therapy.  <p>
<p>
Students in self-contained programs are taught  the academic content areas  in
VE classes.  If the school has sufficient students and ESE teachers, faculty
assignments may be by subject area specialization within the ESE department.
Students may be mainstreamed for art, music, physical education and vocational
exploration.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered best
practice for students in this age group.  Aides and volunteers may be essential
if the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personal
attention.  Support services should be available from FDLRS, program
supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,
and curriculum resource personnel in the school. <p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
The schedule is generally organized by grade level, subject area, and in some
subjects, by functional level.  If there is only one self-contained unit in a
middle school, the content area subjects may rotate on a three year cycle, to
schedule the courses more efficiently.  The number of VE teachers in the school
will affect the flexibility of the scheduling.  <p>

<h3><a name="High School">High School </a></h3><P>

<h4><a name="High School Resource Programs">Resource Programs</a></h4>
<p>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
This program is designed for mildly handicapped students who are served on a
resource basis and do not require intensive related services or therapy.<p>
<p>
High school programs are usually departmentalized.  Students receive
instruction from a number of different teachers.  The VE teacher may provide
instruction in basic classes such as English and mathematics, or in support
areas such as learning strategies, social skills or unique skills.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered best
practice for students in this age group.  Support services should be available
from FDLRS, program supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school
guidance personnel, and curriculum resource personnel in the school.   Job
placement specialists and vocational education services are an important aspect
of the high school program.  Because of the needs for transition services,
other agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation may become involved at this
level.<p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
The schedule is generally organized by grade level, subject area, and in some
subjects, by functional level.  Team teaching has been used successfully in
many districts to support ESE students in mainstream classes.  In this model,
the ESE teacher and the mainstream teacher work as a team to deliver a class.<p>
<p>
Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988)  can enhance the success of the
mainstreaming experience of all ESE students.  (See Elementary School Programs:

<H4>High School</H4><p>

<h4><a name="Self-Contained Programs">Self-Contained Programs for Special Diplomas</a></h4>
<p>
The exceptional students who require full-time placement at the high school
level in many districts are those who are working towards a special diploma.
The full-time students would receive credit in VE classes to meet the
requirements of a special diploma. <p>
<p>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
Districts may establish guidelines to assist in the recommendation of
exceptional students for participation in a functional life skills curriculum
and a special diploma.  Low academic levels, particularly low reading ability,
are commonly used indicators. <p>
<p>
In some districts, this determination is made as a part of the eighth grade
planning process.  The district program specialist may review recommended
students with teachers and other school personnel.  The parent and students may
participate in an IEP review in the spring to make the actual decisions.<p>
<p>
<i> Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered best
practice for students in this age group.  Aides and volunteers may be essential
if the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personal
attention.  Support services should be available from FDLRS, program
supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,
and curriculum resource personnel in the school.   Most special-diploma-seeking
students should be involved with a vocational program.  Because of the needs
for transition services, other agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation may
become involved at this level.<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
 <p>
The functional life skills curriculum emphasizes career awareness, social
skills, and pre-employment habits and attitudes necessary for successful work
adjustment.  Basic skills and problem-solving techniques are presented in a
real-life context to prepare students to function independently as adults. <p>
<p>

<H4>High School</H4><p>

<h4><a name="Vocational Education">Vocational Education Programs</a></h4>
<p>
The purpose of vocational programs at the high school level is to enable
students to develop the ability to communicate appropriately with peers and
adults, to demonstrate the skills and attitudes essential for employment, and
to help students set realistic career goals.  Students are involved in job
preparatory programs to develop specific occupational skills.<p>
<p>
<i>Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model</i><p>
<p>
Students should enroll in vocational programs based on their interest and
aptitude.  Work experience may be provided either on or off campus.  ESE
students may enroll in regular vocational programs or in specially designed
programs.  The VE class generally serves to support the academic and job
training requirements of the program.<p>
<p>
<i>Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff</i><p>
<p>
A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class is conisdered best practice for
students in this age group.  Occupational specialists, vocational
rehabilitation counselors, and ESE specialists and evaluators are needed to
support this program.  For more severely disabled students, job coaches may be
required. <p>
<p>
<i>Program</i><p>
<p>
The program is organized to support the course needs to meet graduation and
vocational program requirements.  The student's work schedule may occur during
the school day or may be arranged in off hours.  Districts may provide the
vocational program through the offerings at a comprehensive high school or in
an area vocational-technical program.<p>
