<p> AFTERNOON SESSION.<br>
<br>
The conference was resumed at 1:30 o'clock p.m., pursuant to the <br>
taking of a recess at noon.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Gentlemen, the Conference will be in <br>
order. We may very well start with the general discussion on the <br>
pharmacological phases of the problem, and you can direct your
questions <br>
to Dr. Munch, Dr. Loewe, or Dr. Bromberg.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, I would like to ask you, in respect to
the <br>
statement made by Dr. Walton that Cannabis has been used as a
relief <br>
during labor in the Far East, are you familiar with that general
picture?<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Yes. I think that the product that is actually used
there is <br>
not Cannabis itself, but one of these peculiar mixtures of datura
and <br>
opium and hashish and other things.<br>
<br>
Some of the reports refer to the women smoking the cigarettes for
a <br>
period in labor, but they are not in agreement with the
information I have <br>
gotten from the Mexicans or out in Nevada, for example, where
they have <br>
tried it and found it of no value.<br>
<br>
On the isolated tissues the solutions of the drug have no effect,
or <br>
have a very mild, quieting action.<br>
<br>
If I remove the alcohol, they have little effect,<br>
<br>
90<br>
<br>
which means that the active principle is not sufficiently soluble
in water <br>
to produce an action. So that I do not believe the action is very
definitely <br>
therapeutic. It is more psychological, I believe, than it is
physiological. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Who is Willis? One of them refers to the fact that <br>
Willis recommends its use in tedious labor where the patient is
restless.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Let me look at my copy of this book. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: It is on page 156.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Did you say &quot;Willis&quot;, Mr. Wollner?<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes. On page 156, &quot;EFFECTS DURING LABOR&quot;.
It starts <br>
out, &quot;Willis recommended&quot;.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Willis has written a book on obstetrics and
gynecology, <br>
but I cannot give you the reference to it right now.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: All right.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: But he is one of the authors in that field. However,
the <br>
work I was referring to more particularly was done by Watt (?)
and <br>
Breyer-Brandwijh, which [sic] I believe is the co-author of the
publication <br>
on poisonous plants in South Africa.<br>
I have had correspondence with Watt along that line.<br>
<br>
91<br>
<br>
He refers to it in the last paragraph there after South Africa. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The reason I ask you that question is because of Dr.
<br>
Bromberg's remarks, which I interpreted as being indicative of
the <br>
production of a hypersensitivity. Am I wrong in that, Dr.
Bromberg? <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: A hypersensitivity?<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: On the part of an individual who uses Marihuana;
that <br>
is, an increased agility.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: The effects I refer to are on a motor activity. You
<br>
refer to those, I presume? <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: By which we mean the promptness to move either <br>
aimlessly or purposefully; that is, in acute intoxication the
smoker is apt <br>
to dance around and move or wave his arms, or go through
movements that <br>
are more rapid than he would move ordinarily; move his chair,
knock it <br>
across the room, talk to people, show a general output of
activity. <br>
<br>
Many of those prisoners whom I have contacted state that they <br>
rather slow up or would rather be quiet during this period. There
are two <br>
effects, in other words.<br>
<br>
The hyperactivity is not universal. The great, ex-<br>
<br>
92<br>
<br>
treme activity results in assault, throwing people around. This
is similar <br>
to what you see in certain types of alcohol intoxication,
so-called <br>
pathological intoxication, where a few drinks set a man off into
a <br>
rampage, breaking things, throwing things around, and fighting. <br>
I think maybe men come in on that more than women because of the <br>
basic physiological pattern. They are more active anyhow. This
refers to <br>
women, does it not? <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: Certainly the effects are not uniform and cannot be
<br>
counterbalanced.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, regarding these 31 admissions <br>
out of 100,000, I think it would be interesting to know just what
period <br>
they cover. Are they of recent origin, or are they scattered
pretty well <br>
throughout the years?<br>
The reason that I bring that up is that the mental hospital at
Burma <br>
showed, with the increased illicit traffic in Marihuana, the
total <br>
admissions of insanity cases rose from .87 to 4.35%. I am
wondering <br>
whether we can expect an increase in such cases, and also whether
these <br>
31 cases are more or less of recent origin.<br>
<br>
93<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: I can answer that by saying that the admissions <br>
already in the past four years of this type of Marihuana insanity
is almost <br>
twice that which it was during the first four years of our
observation, <br>
that is, three years of our observation period.<br>
Of course, you can realize that many other cases go to private <br>
hospitals which pass off without regulatory medical treatment,
and there <br>
are other factors so great that I would not put much reliance on
these <br>
figures. I merely give them to you as true data so far as we have
available.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have been getting some reports from <br>
various sections of the country showing cases of alleged insanity
due to <br>
Marihuana which have been brought to light.<br>
For instance, there were interesting developments in a case in <br>
Findlay, Ohio, concerning a fifteen-year-old boy who showed signs
of <br>
being insane.<br>
When asked about his condition he made statements that he had
been <br>
smoking cigarettes, and an investigation developed the
information that <br>
there were two defendants, who were brothers, who were in charge
of a <br>
playground, and they had been selling drugs that is, Marihuana
cigarettes, <br>
to boys around there; and we found about sixteen pounds concealed
above a <br>
garage owned by them. These fellows had<br>
<br>
94<br>
<br>
stopped selling the drug, because they noticed signs of the boys
acting <br>
queer, and they became frightened. They were particularly alarmed
<br>
because of what they thought was an unusual appetite for the
drug. <br>
We have a questionnaire whereby we ask Marihuana users involved
in <br>
our cases, all sorts of questions. As a matter of fact, I would
like now to <br>
revise that questionnaire, after what I have heard here.<br>
One-fourth of those users when asked what effect the drug has on <br>
them, say, &quot;It gives me a good appetite.&quot; &quot;The
first cigarette makes me <br>
feel hungry.&quot; They become hungry after they smoke, have a
heavy and <br>
exceptionally good appetite. That is their answer without
prompting. Yet <br>
that question does not appear in the questionnaire.<br>
We ask them --- of course, we have to take their word for what
they <br>
say --- whether they notice any permanent physical or mental
effects, and <br>
they make statements which confirm the opinions of Dr. Munch and
Dr. <br>
Bromberg. The answers are:<br>
&quot;I believe it has affected my nerves.&quot;<br>
&quot;I can not keep my mind on one thing long enough to think
clearly.&quot;<br>
&quot;Loss of memory&quot;; &quot;Very bad on nerves&quot;;
&quot;Produces twisted thoughts&quot;; <br>
&quot;Affects my brain&quot;; &quot;Dulls my head.&quot;<br>
<br>
95<br>
<br>
&quot;Causes me to become deaf&quot;.<br>
&quot;I think I‘m more intelligent.&quot;<br>
&quot;Makes me tired&quot;. &quot;Hard to think&quot;
&quot;Headache and weakness&quot;. <br>
&quot;Seemingly dulls senses&quot;; and so on. <br>
Then the question is asked: &quot;What effects do you obtain from
<br>
smoking Marihuana?&quot; I think most of the answers confirm what
has been <br>
said about the distortion of space, time, vision and hearing. <br>
The auditory sensibilities are affected.<br>
We are running into a great deal of cases which have to do with <br>
illicit traffic among musicians.<br>
The next question is, &quot;Have you acquired tolerance?&quot;
Quite a number <br>
of the users have developed a craving for Marihuana. Some of them
stop <br>
after smoking few cigarettes, and there is no sign here that they
increase <br>
the number that they smoke in a day.<br>
Some of them vary between one cigarette and twenty cigarettes a <br>
day. Others have smoked it once; some have smoked it for ten
years. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I was wondering whether it would not be better, <br>
unless there are other specific questions, to postpone this
portion of the <br>
Conference, which relates to bio-assay, which pertains to a
chemist, <br>
because all of those questions are related, and go on with the
rest of<br>
<br>
96<br>
<br>
the program.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: All right, unless there are questions. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, do you wish to say some thing?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Among other things, I have tried Marihuana's action on
a <br>
monkey, and I went to it with great hopes because I thought
really that the <br>
psychic action would come out in this patient.<br>
The observations were that the monkey reacts like the dog, and is
<br>
one more of the few laboratory species which really show the
ataxia <br>
action.<br>
The other observation was that the monkey required higher doses
per <br>
kilogram body weight than the dog, which was somewhat unexpected,
and <br>
that all of the lower doses to which I have climbed up through
the ratio of <br>
higher doses did not show anything which indicated a psychic
action. <br>
The monkeys do not show this type of abnormality which occurs in <br>
Dr. Bromberg's material.<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What is the relation in the dosage per kilogram of <br>
weight of dog and human being?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: The dog dosage per kilogram of weight and the human <br>
being per kilogram of weight, are fairly<br>
<br>
97<br>
<br>
close. The higher doses used in humans are capable of showing the
<br>
slightest ataxia symptoms, which would point to the fact that the
dosage <br>
is almost the same.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: This ataxia is never apparent in humans at all? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: I have no experience; I never saw it. <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: I never saw it either.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Have you any observations about ataxia symptoms <br>
comparable to those in dogs as to humans?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: No; but I have never seen a large enough quantity, <br>
certainly not the tincture or the fluid extract.<br>
<br>
Dr. Munch can perhaps answer that.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: I have given doses up to twice that re-cognized, but I
have <br>
not noticed ataxia in students.<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: There is one factor which, of course, is important,
and it <br>
is a fact which we notice from tobacco smoking, and that is that
the <br>
dosage in the form of the cigarette is probably high enough to
produce <br>
great ataxic symptoms in humans by way of the administration of
inhala-<br>
tion.<br>
<br>
DR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Dr. Bromberg, clinically,
whether <br>
there is a direct physiological addiction to this; that is, are
withdrawal <br>
symptoms produced or do<br>
<br>
98<br>
<br>
you think it is purely a psychic addiction?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: My idea of habituation on this matter is different,
and <br>
there happen to be several, and we should have the thing
clarified. <br>
Habituation must rest on three cases, two of them being habit <br>
forming.<br>
The first are the symptoms appearing of withdrawal of the habit <br>
forming drug.<br>
The second is that the patient develops tolerance. <br>
The third is that because he needs more drug he gets the pleasure
of <br>
addiction, and all medicine agrees that there must be withdrawal.
<br>
A morphine addict becomes intolerant of withdrawal. He has <br>
abdominal pains and various symptoms. When morphine is given he
feels <br>
better. And that is the basis of a well known treatment.<br>
Secondly, there are the people who take increasing doses to feel <br>
well. Those two are well acknowledged criteria.<br>
In the New York County jail, the physician in charge thinks he
sees <br>
withdrawal symptoms, but the offenders are not allowed to discuss
the <br>
offense with anyone except counsel. They say they did smoke it,
or they <br>
did not. You do not know whether the symptoms are tied up with
the<br>
<br>
99<br>
<br>
drug.<br>
<br>
So, I dare say that there are no clear withdrawal symptoms. The <br>
thing is not settled. Patients come in after being cut off
without the drug.<br>
The third is addiction of pleasure-loving, and in that category
comes <br>
smoking and colorful music and things of that nature. You can say
that one <br>
has to have pleasure after he becomes addicted to luxury, and
that can be <br>
looked upon as a valid psychiatric observation.<br>
So I would stop there and say that we can say that in the absence
of <br>
other evidence, that it is essentially hedonistic addiction.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, you mentioned in your experiment on dogs <br>
that you had injected some of these extracts, but, nevertheless,
in most of <br>
the experiments that had been previously done, I gather, the drug
had been <br>
taken orally. Of course, we know the stuff is smoked.<br>
Your introduction of injection as a method of administration
raises <br>
the question in my mind as to whether we might, at some future
date, <br>
anticipate the use of that on humans, in this way? Is there any
possibility <br>
of this sort? Similar to that which obtains in heroin, for
example? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Only after the isolation in pure form<br>
<br>
100<br>
<br>
I would say, because, at the present time, by use. of the
extracts it <br>
will not be an element in the whole picture to introduce it by
intravenous <br>
injection. It has to be injected in alcohol solution, and a
slight injection <br>
introduces a bad local infection, pain, and so on.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Why were you impelled to use it as an injection as a
<br>
method of administration, rather than giving it to your dogs
orally, Dr. <br>
Loewe?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: It goes faster. In view of the long period of latency,
it is <br>
much more convenient to use it intravenously injected, because
the peak <br>
of the curve is reached sooner.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Would you conclude from that that on dogs, for <br>
example, as a medium for standardization, that they are not as
radically <br>
different when the stuff is in-jected as compared to when it is <br>
administered orally?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Probably that is true, but only to an inconsiderable <br>
extent. In a slighter extent the variations have been reported by
various <br>
examinators [sic] after oral administration.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Will you recommend it as the preferred procedure for
<br>
bio-assay.<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: I am not sure that I should give the preference to the
<br>
intravenous way. I have to collect more<br>
<br>
101<br>
<br>
experiences.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Are the effects otherwise identical? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Identical.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The curve is more rapid; I mean you achieve the peak
of <br>
the curve more rapidly. <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Comparatively more rapidly. Beginning after only
twenty <br>
minutes, and reaching the peak after half an hour or an hour. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Your experiments with mice were continued under the <br>
same circumstances?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: No. As to mice, they were injected orally only.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We can now go on to the sociological <br>
phases.<br>
In 88 users there were 86 males and only 2 females. I do not know
if <br>
that holds true generally. We might have got off the rails on the
selection, <br>
but that is what those figures show.<br>
There were 47 white, 20 colored, 15 Latin Americans. The age, of <br>
course, is much younger than among opium users. Most of the users
were <br>
between 17 and 35. The greatest number was between 21 and 25. <br>
I believe that was true of a survey made in New York City of the <br>
users.<br>
<br>
102<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We had 100 arrests there between January 1st and <br>
October 1st that ran: 99 Negro, 60 white, and 1 yellow; and the
nativity, <br>
(and this nativity includes New York City and up-state New York:)
5 <br>
Mexican, 1 Chinese, 32 Puerto Rican, 2 Greek:, some from South
America, <br>
Cuba, Panama, and other places with 130 native born.<br>
Then, in addition, I have 12 other cases, which to me were more <br>
interesting, because those persons who were held for crimes other
than <br>
possession, and they ran such as unlawful entry, 3 for grand
larceny, in <br>
addition to their possession; 1 for grand larceny, who admits he
is a user.<br>
Of course, the other possessor cases probably were users, but
they <br>
are charged with possession. One with felonious assault with a
pistol and <br>
possession; One, exposure of person; one felonious assault, both
users; and <br>
another, felonious assault with possession; and one a wayward
minor who <br>
admits, in addition to using Marihuana, that he is using heroin;
one with <br>
assault and robbery, and one who was a policy peddler. They were
held on <br>
other charges, rather than on mere possession charges.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What is the distribution in sexes, there, Mr. Smith?
<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I have not the age nor sex distribution on those.<br>
<br>
103<br>
<br>
In at least four cases up-state we can show a definite connection
<br>
with prostitution. In one we had a good report, not proven, but a
good <br>
report that the Negro who was in possession was also running a
school, <br>
teaching youngsters how to smoke Marihuana. Actually, we are not
certain <br>
about the facts as to that, but that is the report that has been
current <br>
with that individual. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Do you have anything on occupations <br>
of the users? <br>
MR. SMITH: We have four as musicians, two as farmers, and those <br>
two farmers were actually growing Marihuana on their farms. <br>
Many of them state &quot;unemployed&quot;. But where most of
those that <br>
report unemployed are laborers, they usually are associated with <br>
prostitution, policy, and some of the allied types of minor grade
crimes.<br>
Prostitution, to me, seemed the most evident connection.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our 88, the occupation runs anywhere <br>
from bartender to unemployed. There are probably 50 different <br>
occupations, musicians are second to laborers,-of the 88.<br>
<br>
The rest were distributed throughout the various<br>
<br>
104<br>
<br>
occupations.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I can give you a breakdown on that section. I have it
here <br>
in another portion of my data.<br>
There were 5 women arrested as sellers, and 8 women arrested for <br>
possession, and 147 males arrested for possession, and 7 for
selling. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: About 10 per cent. <br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our geographical distribution, we show
<br>
the larger number of these around New York; a few in the New
England <br>
areas; a few in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, several in the
Middle <br>
Atlantic States, about 5 in the South, Kentucky and Tennessee,
four; <br>
Michigan-Ohio, 13, Michigan-Ohio is second to New York.<br>
And then they string out through the rest of the States, with <br>
California probably third.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: In States with equal population ratios, as to the <br>
metropolitan district, as against up-state New York, our arrests
for <br>
Marihuana violations in the State, excluding New York City, are
about 10 <br>
per cent; 15 cases, actually, against 160.<br>
They probably will vary, though, as to the development of <br>
prosecution and apprehension, as in the various up-state cities
they are <br>
just beginning to realize in the<br>
<br>
105<br>
<br>
last year that Marihuana is a problem, and the figures for 1938
will be <br>
higher than 1937. I expect 1939 will again be higher in up-state
New York, <br>
so that that ratio of about 10 percent should rise.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Bromberg, you were about to start on <br>
the sociological phases. Will you give us the benefit of your
views on <br>
that?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: The material that I have collected comes from the <br>
Court of General Sessions. This is the criminal court of New York
City.<br>
Our material is limited to New York County, although it must be <br>
remembered that the courts clientele comes from many sections of
the <br>
country.<br>
We must also note that there are many racial types in our
material. <br>
This is important, because the British investigators have noted
in India <br>
that Cannabis does not bring out the motor excitement or
hysterical <br>
symptoms among Anglo-Saxon users that occurs among natives. There
are <br>
several other difficulties in selecting reliable material, one
being the <br>
dependence on statements from prisoners without opportunity for <br>
objective tests or other corroborative checks, as in the case of
other <br>
drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine.<br>
During the routine interviews of some 17,000 offend-<br>
<br>
106<br>
<br>
ers during six and a half years, we have come across several
hundred who <br>
have had direct experience with Cannabis. Their testimony checks
with <br>
experimental results and clinical experiences in regard to <br>
symptomatology of intoxication, the absence of true addiction,
and the <br>
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this
noteworthy <br>
among sexual offenders, and in cases of assault or murder.<br>
The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press, that <br>
crime is caused by Marihuana addiction, demand careful scrutiny. <br>
The cases analyzed in this study cover a period of more than six <br>
years, from 1932 to 1938. Out of over 16,000 prisoners in this
six-year <br>
period, 200 offenders were convicted of drug charges or found to
be users <br>
of drugs, although convicted of other charges, in the Court of
General <br>
Sessions.<br>
Cases of possession for sale are handled in the Court of General <br>
Sessions which has jurisdiction over felonies. There is no
distinction <br>
made in the indictment in the Court of General Sessions as to the
nature <br>
of the drug sold.<br>
<br>
Of this group of 200 drug offenders, 67 were indicated to be
users of <br>
Marihuana in any degree and for any duration of time whether
convicted of <br>
the crime of selling Marihuana or another crime.<br>
<br>
107<br>
<br>
The remaining 133 offenders were morphine or heroin users.<br>
It is important to note that the only measure of Marihuana usage
is <br>
the statement of the offender. Since statements of use are
conceived by <br>
them to be prejudicial to their interests in court, we meet
evasion and <br>
denial fairly consistently.<br>
Our most reliable source of information is from those not
arrested <br>
for traffic in drugs and questioned in the routine course of
psychiatric <br>
study.<br>
Now, this leaves out thousands of smokers who were never
arrested, <br>
people who were never arrested, and people that we deal with who
were <br>
arrested for major crimes, including the one of selling drugs.
Those people <br>
were all questioned about Marihuana.<br>
Those who were arrested for selling drugs, specifically
Marihuana, <br>
were questioned as to the use of it. Some of those admitted using
it, and <br>
some did not.<br>
All the criminological material that we have has to be taken with
a <br>
very large dose of salt, and they are either convicted by the
time we see <br>
them, or about to be, and are still frightened, and want to keep
their fair <br>
records clean.<br>
The only useful record which we have in which we can<br>
<br>
108<br>
<br>
throw out and include material as it sounds reasonable to us, and
it is <br>
checked, so far as the use of the sociological aspects of it, and
the effect <br>
of it, and so forth, so that in the General Sessions of Criminal
Court the <br>
87 cases of Marihuana users consisted of 21 whites (native born
and <br>
European extraction), 23 Negroes, 20 Puerto Ricans (some of whom
are <br>
considered to be racial mixtures), 2 Mexicans, and one Negro and
Indian <br>
mixture.<br>
Of the 67 studied, 46 were convicted of possession and sale of <br>
drugs, and 21 other charges. Among the 21 cases convicted of
crimes other <br>
than the possession of and sale of drugs, were eight charges of
burglary, <br>
five of grand larceny, three of robbery, two of assault, one each
of petit <br>
larceny, forgery, and first degree murder, and none of sexual
offenses. <br>
Burglary, grand larceny, and robbery, then, account for 16 of the
21 cases. <br>
There were but two sex cases of any description in the history of
the <br>
Marihuana cases, in both of which sodomy occurred as previous
offenses. <br>
In three cases, the individuals were what might be called
constant users <br>
of Marihuana. One of these had commenced to use the Marihuana
three <br>
years previous to the current conviction; another, with a sixteen
year <br>
record, indicated Marihuana, had been used for fifteen years; the
third <br>
referred to his use of Marihuana as<br>
<br>
109<br>
<br>
&quot;several years” duration. None of the offenders reported
any lasting <br>
effects from Marihuana. Interrogations as to the habit-forming
nature of <br>
Marihuana were all answered in the negative by the prisoners. <br>
So that in the General Sessions of Criminal Court the 67 people
who <br>
were offenders were involved in selling Marihuana or gave some
history of <br>
using it. Most of those people had previous charges, not
including drugs, as <br>
to being criminals of other types. The largest proportion were
not drug <br>
users.<br>
The next largest number had no previous connection with the 67. <br>
Fifty had never been arrested for taking any drugs. This was
their first <br>
contact with the court. These were all special cases in the
Special <br>
Sessions Court, which deals with misdemeanors and other cases. <br>
Here, there were 202 cases. Thirteen were there on the first
charge <br>
of any kind, that being a Marihuana charge. Those things do not
mean very <br>
much to me, as they simply give a certain picture, a picture of
people <br>
being picked up and brought in for using Marihuana, and there is
not a very <br>
heavy weighted criminal record behind them. Drug users are not
Marihuana <br>
users in the main.<br>
In the Court of Special Sessions in the same picture, in the same
<br>
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 in-<br>
<br>
110<br>
<br>
dictments for all crimes, there were 6,000 convictions for
possession and <br>
use of drugs. Since neither the law, the district attorney, nor
the police <br>
department make any distinction between the several kinds of
narcotics, <br>
their arraignments or indictments, in Special Sessions as well as
General <br>
Sessions, there were no figures from which to estimate the number
of <br>
Marihuana users as distinguished from the number of users of
other drugs. <br>
We therefore adopted a system of sampling the 6,000 cases in
order to <br>
arrive at an approximate estimation of the total number of
Marihuana users <br>
who came into conflict with the law. In this sampling, we
examined the <br>
records of l,500 cases, or 25 per cent of the total of 6,000. Of
these, 135 <br>
were Marihuana charges. From this, it was estimated that about
540 cases, <br>
or 9 per cent of all drug cases coming to Special Sessions over a
period of <br>
six years, were users of Marihuana. <br>
Analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found that 93 had no <br>
previous record; 8 had a previous drug charge or charges, only; 5
had <br>
previous charges, including drugs; and 29 had records not
including drug <br>
charges. Among those with longer records, that is, from four to
seven <br>
previous arrests, none showed progression in crime from drugs to
other <br>
crimes.<br>
<br>
111<br>
<br>
In considering all the Marihuana cases in both General Sessions <br>
and Special Sessions Courts, a total of 202 convictions, it is an
impressive <br>
fact that only 30 offenders had been arrested before for drug
charges. This <br>
does not argue very strongly for Marihuana as a drug that
initiates criminal <br>
careers. <br>
Where there is a series of crimes committed by one individual,
our <br>
records show that he passes from other forms of crime to the use
of drugs. <br>
Thus, in only three cases out of our series of 67, in which an
arrest <br>
associated with Marihuana was recorded, did the criminal career
start with <br>
the use of Marihuana, and in 7 cases out of 67 criminal activity
started <br>
with other drugs. Ninety per cent of the group is accounted for
by those who <br>
(1) have no criminal record except as drug users, and (2) have a
previous <br>
record from which they turned to drugs This leaves a small
minority of <br>
offenders whose criminal careers started with drugs and went on
to other <br>
crimes like larceny, assault, and so on. As measured by the
succession of <br>
arrests and convictions in the General Sessions cases (our only
method of <br>
estimation), it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate
criminal <br>
careers. Similarly, in Special Sessions, only 8 had previous
charges of <br>
drugs, and 3.7 per cent has previous charges of drugs and other <br>
<br>
112<br>
<br>
petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases in this group of 135,
then, <br>
earlier usage did not apparently predispose these offenders to
crime, even <br>
that of drug usage. Whether the first offender Marihuana cases go
on to <br>
major crime can only be ascertained by referring to the findings
of the <br>
General Sessions Courts. The expectancy of major crimes following
the use <br>
of Cannabis, then, is small, according to our experiences<br>
The problem of habituation of Cannabis is one of grave importance
<br>
According to the statements of confirmed heroin or morphine
addicts, <br>
Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug. Naturally, where it is
used in <br>
conjunction with heroin, morphine or cocaine another problem
presents <br>
itself.<br>
Occasionally, an astute drug peddler will adulterate Marihuana <br>
cigarettes with morphine or heroin in order to retain his
clientele. Care <br>
must be exercised in evaluating the question of Marihuana
habituation, so <br>
that we are not dealing with this type of adulterated Cannabis. <br>
<br>
The medical diagnosis of habituation depends on the accepted
criteria <br>
of acquired tolerance and after-effect upon withdrawal of the
drug. <br>
Regarding the subject of tolerance, users of Marihuana examined
in the <br>
clinic universally state that an increase in dosage is not neces-
<br>
<br>
113<br>
<br>
sary to achieve the desired effect as time goes on.<br>
The increase in cigarette consumption, sometimes noted, is simply
<br>
related to how often and how long the smoker wants to experience
these <br>
effects.<br>
As to the question of withdrawal symptoms, cases have never, to
the <br>
knowledge of the writer, been observed systematically in an
environment <br>
where control of the drug can be exercised. Although of secondary
value in <br>
deciding the problem of habituation, it should be noticed that
experience <br>
with experimental subjects indicates that after usage of the drug
and its <br>
cessation no withdrawal symptoms are reported.<br>
<br>
It has not been possible to observe satisfactorily Marihuana
users <br>
upon their entrance into custody to establish their behavior
after cessation <br>
of usage. For one thing, the law does not allow questioning of a
defendant <br>
prior to trial regarding his charge. The history of the offense
cannot be <br>
discussed except with counsel, but an offender can be questioned
in the <br>
course of medical treatment. The fact that Marihuana cases do not
request <br>
medical treatment upon their incarceration argues for the absence
of <br>
withdrawal symptoms.<br>
As is well known, morphine, opium, etc., users become violently
ill <br>
upon being taken in custody, away from the<br>
<br>
114<br>
<br>
source of their drug, and are vociferous in their demands for
treatment.<br>
Nevertheless, the wide discrepancies between the reports of other
<br>
jurisdictions and ours in the question of addiction to Cannabis
demands a <br>
serious attempt to establish the facts in the case.<br>
Up to March 26, 1938, Cannabis was classed as a habit-forming
drug <br>
in Section 1751 of the Penal Code, based on Public Health Law,
Article 22, <br>
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. Due to difficulty in this Court in
proving it to <br>
be a habit-forming drug (case of People vs. Williams), the Law
Revision <br>
Commission, appointed by the New York State Legislature, was
requested <br>
to amend the Penal Code to read &quot;narcotic&quot; rather than
&quot;habit-forming&quot; <br>
drug.<br>
From a legal point of view, therefore, the problem of whether it
is <br>
habit-forming or not is not vital in this and many other States,
since its <br>
use as a narcotic by un-authorized persons is an offense.<br>
The writer believes it highly desirable and important that a <br>
Commission be appointed to examine the matter scientifically as
was <br>
done in the case of narcosan and other reputed drug cures in 1921
at the <br>
Bellevue Psychopathic Hospital under Commissioner Patterson of
the <br>
Department of Correction.<br>
<br>
115<br>
<br>
The most that one can say on the basis of ascertainable facts is
that <br>
prolonged Marihuana usage constitutes a &quot;sensual&quot;
addiction, in that the <br>
user wishes to experience again and again the ecstatic sensations
and <br>
feelings which the drug produces. <br>
Unlike morphine addiction, which is biochemically as well as <br>
psychologically determined, prolonged Marihuana usage is
essentially in the <br>
services of the hedonistic elements of the personality. <br>
Those are the main conclusions I have developed from that.<br>
Then we took the cases of the Marihuana users and tried to break <br>
those down. It indicates that no murderers were found among this
group of <br>
67, not one murder committed in these six or seven years by a
Marihuana <br>
user.<br>
There were no sex cases among these 67. We have, however, seven <br>
hundred odd sex cases, from first degree rape down to
exhibitionism, and in <br>
the course of the six or seven years not one of them was a
Marihuana user, <br>
according to history or physical examination.<br>
At the time of our examination, two of them had sex cases in
their <br>
history some years before. One was sodomy, and the other some
other type <br>
of offense.<br>
Of all of these people, only three called themselves<br>
<br>
116<br>
<br>
constant users. One for three years and twelve months, and the
others <br>
nine months.<br>
There is one other point which I would like to mention and that
is <br>
the case of a man named Joseph Ogden who is reported among others
in Mr. <br>
Merrill's paper as having been an addict.<br>
I saw him and spent some time with him. He was a psychopathic <br>
individual. I think he had been in the State hospital at
Lexington, and had <br>
had several other arrests. But nothing in his history indicated
Marihuana. <br>
In other words, the newspaper accounts must be discounted. The
fact of <br>
the matter was that he had not even been a drug addict, but was a
<br>
homosexualist. The offender was murdered by him and shoved into a
trunk. <br>
I do not know whether he disarticulated his arms or not, but he
sent the <br>
trunk to the express station, and they saw blood oozing out of
it, and <br>
picked him up.<br>
He told the story rather frankly. It was a horrible crime. I
think <br>
Marihuana was innocent of that. I am sure of that, because I have
been able <br>
to check that very carefully.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have observed two cases of sex <br>
crimes where we have been able to prove the connection with
Marihuana. <br>
<br>
117<br>
<br>
A boy named Perez, in Baltimore raped a ten-year-old girl, and of
<br>
course he blamed it on Marihuana.<br>
It so happened that, just a year before that, Perez had been
picked up <br>
by the Baltimore police for the sale of 2,500 grains of Cannabis,
and got <br>
three months in jail. This sex offense happened the following
year.<br>
And there is another case down in Corpus Christi that we have
been <br>
able to establish, where an oil worker with a good reputation,
obtained and <br>
smoked a cigarette, after which he raped his young daughter.<br>
Those are two cases that I know of in which we have proof.<br>
In the case of Perez, we do not know what else might have been
wrong <br>
with him, but he was definitely a user and a seller of Marihuana.
<br>
I believe that Mr. Smith has had a great deal of experience up
through <br>
New York State.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We have had one case in the last two or three months, <br>
which has been of great interest to the Motor Vehicle Department.
A <br>
youngster in Mount Kisco, close to New York City, was involved in
an <br>
automobile accident in that village by hitting three parked cars
during the <br>
evening. When he was apprehended by the police, he literally tore
the <br>
officer's blouse from his shoulder,<br>
<br>
118<br>
<br>
and he had great difficulty in subduing him. <br>
During the evening, they first thought it was alcohol, but later
the <br>
youngster admitted having used a &quot;reefer&quot;. From the
information we <br>
obtained from him, we apprehended an individual who was growing
it, and I <br>
think we picked up about six pounds. <br>
We had another case farther up-state, not as well established,
but <br>
apparently pretty well shown, of the inability of the automobile
driver to <br>
perceive distance and speed. <br>
So that factor will be of considerable interest to those
interested in <br>
traffic control. <br>
Because of that recent case in White Plains, we have had some
inquiry <br>
from the State Motor Vehicle Department, and they arc
considering, I <br>
believe, the advisability of revoking the licenses of operators
who can be <br>
shown to be users of Marihuana, in the same fashion that we are
now able <br>
to do after showing evidence of narcotism. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that in your State law now?<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: No, sir, it is not in our State law now.<br>
In fact, I do not know if it was decided that we could get away
with <br>
it, but through the Motor Vehicle Department we could, as one of
the <br>
requirements in the matter of<br>
<br>
119<br>
<br>
ability on the questionnaire in New York up-state you have to
state whether <br>
or not you use narcotic drugs.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Marihuana users, when arrested, want to <br>
fight.<br>
Their motor impulses seem to be working It takes, sometimes, four
or <br>
five officers to subdue a man, and they sometimes wreck the
living <br>
quarters in doing so.<br>
We do not have anything like that in arresting opium users.<br>
The agents proceed very cautiously when arresting a Marihuana
user.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: It conflicts with alcohol which seem to be the worst
cases <br>
yet, and we have had a few cases who used both. Those are perhaps
the few <br>
that you have run across. Then, of course, we have those who have
just been <br>
on the reefer alone.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER, I have noticed a tendency towards more <br>
gunplay among Marihuana users than among opium users.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Than among opium users?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes. And there has been some gun play. <br>
The first case that we arrested under the Marihuana Act, (I
happened <br>
to have been present in the Denver court<br>
<br>
120<br>
<br>
when they brought this fellow up before the judge.) had been a
user for a <br>
number of years. He was only 23 years old, but many of his
arrests were for <br>
assault.<br>
I have noticed that many of these violators have a record of
assault. <br>
In Wilmington, Delaware, there was the case of John Rhodes, who <br>
attacked an officer with a knife and was shot and killed
resisting arrest.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I have four out of twelve in one city where the
charges, in <br>
addition to possession, are assault.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In many cases, particularly around Ohio, <br>
the officers are called in cases of disturbance and they find a
Marihuana <br>
user with some stuff on him.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: A chap I talked to told me that the use of gin came in
very <br>
particularly with the use of a reefer. Is that true with opium?
Do Marihuana <br>
users tend to take gin along with smoking of the reefer?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not know about that. We have not run
<br>
into that.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: The point I am asking could be that the alcohol there
would <br>
tend to increase the solubility of any material that has been
swallowed, <br>
and, therefore, they would get greater effect under such
conditions than if <br>
they. had not taken the alcohol.<br>
<br>
121<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT One of the Internal Revenue officials, formerly in <br>
Texas, has told us that down there persons use alcohol and
Marihuana <br>
together, and where they were very wild it took four or five
officers to <br>
bring a man in. He attributed that to the combined effect rather
than the <br>
effect of either one.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Still, there is a good deal of fancy on the part of
some <br>
officers, whose experience with Marihuana is new.<br>
I have had some experience with one or two sheriffs. I know of
one <br>
who recently employed the services of two other sheriffs and four
deputy <br>
sheriffs to secure the arrest of a farmer on a farm where the
material was <br>
growing.<br>
Any youngster, 18 or 19 years old, could have gone there and done
it <br>
alone. This was because of the first experience of those officers
with it. I <br>
think the men were anxious to capitalize on the possible
publicity which <br>
might attend the arrest. So that sometimes you run up against
that problem, <br>
where they report that it is necessary for a number of them to
subdue an <br>
individual. That may be an effort to make it appear a more
serious type of <br>
crime.<br>
So that I think we have to put our tongues in our<br>
<br>
122<br>
<br>
cheeks as to this, also.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: This story came from Deputy Commissioner Berkshire,
<br>
of the Alcohol Tax Unit.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We did have in White Plains this additional situation:
The <br>
fact appeared there that with children of high school age with
good <br>
financial and social background, that two of those individuals,
who were in <br>
difficulties there, stated that the smoking of reefers had become
a part of <br>
the initiation in certain clubs or school fraternities.<br>
<br>
That probably is a little bit unusual, as an incident, but that
has been <br>
definitely reported in that vicinity. <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Where was that?<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: That was in White Plains, New York.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Did you not arrest a youngster sixteen <br>
years old for selling?<br>
<br>
Mr.. SMITH: Yes, sir. There were two youngsters of excellent <br>
background, and fine social connections. That was probably a
larger factor, <br>
as compared to anything else, I think, and that was that they
probably had <br>
too much financial and social backing. That may be more true in
that <br>
particular county than in other counties in that State.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You mentioned a case of a<br>
<br>
123<br>
<br>
young man using Marihuana and heroin.<br>
<br>
MR. WITH: Yes, sir. That was in New York City. <br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What had he used first, do you know?<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I do not know. That, I extracted from the Police <br>
Department records last Tuesday, but I did .not have time to go
back and get <br>
the individual cards, and I doubt very much whether the
information which <br>
appears in the police cards will show that.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have not run into many peddlers of <br>
heroin who also handle Marihuana, and we have not run into many
users of <br>
Marihuana who are also heroin users. However, as Dr. Bouquet
points out, in <br>
Tunis there is a tendency to switch from Marihuana to heroin. <br>
Have you run into any cases like that, Doctor? <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: I have seen many drug addicts, who have, once or <br>
twice, they say, tried Marihuana, and have dropped it, because it
was not <br>
strong enough. Most true addicts start with heroin or opium.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Do you not think that that might be more the
association <br>
with individuals than the association with the drug?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: Perhaps. And there is one other fact, and that is
that <br>
alcohol and Marihuana have a more potent<br>
<br>
124<br>
<br>
effect than alcohol alone.<br>
I had a case where a man started smoking Marihuana. The seller <br>
introduced heroin, he noticed the effect, and he became a user,
but, of <br>
course, that was not through any choice.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: As to this question of using alcohol with
<br>
Marihuana, I recall a case in Indiana where a man was arrested
who had an <br>
infusion of the drug in alcohol. How do they do that? Drink it
and smoke a <br>
cigarette?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: No. I think it is a sociological matter. He uses
the gin <br>
with it, or otherwise, and it depends on the amount of money and
the <br>
locality, and they smoke, and it represents having some fun, the
effect <br>
which they look for.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I wonder how much can be deduced from the present <br>
figures in the matter of crime, in view of the fact that these
figures <br>
represent a static picture whereas the entire Marihuana picture,
so far as I <br>
know, is on an up-curve.<br>
Have you noticed any tendencies that are not static over a period
of <br>
years Dr. Bromberg?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: That is a very good question, because the alcohol
thing <br>
depends on the relationship between the two.<br>
<br>
125<br>
<br>
But I have been in contact with the court for about five years,
and the <br>
number of Marihuana peddlers has not increased, but the number of
<br>
Marihuana users we do not know about.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: In what order, would you say?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: It is impossible to say. These are only
approximations, <br>
I admit. It all depends on the police activities.<br>
They make a drive, and the figures go up. They forget about it,
and <br>
there are no figures.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are there any questions as to this phase
of <br>
the problem?<br>
I must say that we are still sort of groping as to a lot of those
<br>
questions.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: May I intrude there, just as a matter of difference in
mind, <br>
as to any sort of figure representing the total number of users
of <br>
Marihuana? I mean, has anybody said anything as to the number of
heroine <br>
users being the same as the opium addicts, or less or more, or as
to the <br>
Marihuana?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is impossible to say. The eradication
of <br>
16,000 acres of Marihuana during the past year means nothing as
to <br>
numbers of users. We are sure it was never meant for the illicit
traffic. <br>
Probably<br>
<br>
126<br>
<br>
15,000 of the 16,000 acres was wild growth.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: You mean additional acreage than that which had <br>
humans on it?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have arrested over 1,000. The Bureau
of <br>
Prisons is a little concerned about that, because it is causing a
definite <br>
increase in their jails.<br>
Puerto Rico is starting to send a lot of these sellers and users
to jail, <br>
which they did not do before. There has been a tremendous
up-grade in <br>
apprehensions.<br>
I do not recall just what the arrests have been by states
throughout <br>
the country. These are Federal arrests. State arrests are
probably over that <br>
figure.<br>
I should say that the 16,000 acres represent only a drop in the
bucket, <br>
because I know in one State there are 300,000 acres of the wild
growth. We <br>
have a job here on eradication that is just stupendous.<br>
Fortunately, a lot of this acreage that is discovered we hear
about <br>
through people who do not tell anybody else about it.<br>
The illicit trafficker is looking for growth. I cannot understand
why <br>
the New York trafficker had to go out to Minnesota and strip some
of those <br>
hemp fields.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We had two instances where the material was either <br>
reported to be, or actually was, of western<br>
<br>
127<br>
<br>
growth, and they were getting a higher price than was paid
apparently for <br>
New York grown. Whether that was bona fide, as to the material
from New <br>
York State, or as to the material from Minnesota, I do not know,
or whether <br>
it was a question of price boosting as to the New York sales
prices, we still <br>
do not know.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think within a couple of blocks from <br>
where Dr. Munch lives you can walk into as much [as] fifty acres
that has <br>
not been destroyed.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: They went over about 300 acres of that this year and
ran <br>
out of C.C.C. men and then stopped.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: That is a tremendous problem with us. We <br>
have used many of the agencies of the Government, the W.P.A. has
helped, <br>
and other agencies. We have discouraged all of these well-meaning
people <br>
throughout the country who want to use Boy Scouts in the removal
of' <br>
Marihuana.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: We have had considerable cooperation through Admiral <br>
Foote, and the Automobile Vehicle Department of our State.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: May I ask Dr. Bromberg whether or not his contacts
with <br>
these patients show whether or not there is any indication of
whether <br>
these cigarettes used were tobacco which had been adulterated
with <br>
Marihuana?<br>
<br>
128<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: My source of information is the Police Department,
and <br>
the cigarettes that they have gathered up are filled definitely
with <br>
Marihuana, and no other compound.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I would like to ask Dr. Bromberg, or anybody else who
has <br>
had experience as to the likelihood of development of perversion.
<br>
Has anybody had any experience on that?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Kolb, have you run into anything on <br>
that? <br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: No, sir. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How many of these users have you in <br>
Lexington?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: There are about one hundred patients who have used it <br>
occasionally, but they are mostly opium and heroin users. <br>
About twenty-five have used nothing but Marihuana alone. <br>
But, just as Dr. Bromberg has stated they use it occasionally,
just to <br>
see if it is another drug that they need.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are these Marihuana users, as such, a <br>
younger group than your opium smokers?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Most of the time.<br>
<br>
129<br>
<br>
For instance, we had a man from Puerto Rico, about fifty years
old, <br>
who had been a judge, and who said it was a political plot that
he should <br>
get four years. I do not know how politics came into it.<br>
He said, &quot;Well, they are trying to get rid of me.&quot;<br>
He never had any criminal record. That seemed to be a rather
strong <br>
sentence for users.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have noticed the tendency in Puerto <br>
Rico, even with heroin users, to give them five years for use
only.<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Yes, they give them a very severe sentence.<br>
The district attorney wrote me and wanted to take it up with
judge <br>
Cooper. I told him that, from the stand-point of rehabilitation,
it was a <br>
rather harmful matter to put a man in prison for four years. He
is liable to <br>
learn a lot of things in prison and then go out and hate society
and use them <br>
against society.<br>
It is my idea that users should get one year, and especially the
fellow <br>
who does not have a criminal record.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not think the courts here are being
too <br>
severe.<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB' No, they are not.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: They are giving the seller<br>
<br>
130<br>
<br>
a great deal more than the user, on the average. <br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Of course.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What does your investigation represent as to these <br>
twenty-five users of Marihuana alone, as compared to those who
use other <br>
drugs other than Marihuana?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Of course, we get them after they have stopped using
the <br>
drug, and after they have escaped the acute effects of the drugs,
There is <br>
only one psychiatric case, which we are not quite sure of, that
has been due <br>
to using the Marihuana drug.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I am going to ask an awfully unfair question.<br>
What percentage of these people would have been in jail if they
had <br>
not smoked Marihuana? <br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Well, very few of them.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: They would hot have been in jail?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: That applies to a great many users of drugs.<br>
A great many of them have done other things, particularly
thievery, or <br>
other slippery types of work. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Are they slightly impaired?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: They are slightly impaired, partly due to the
psychiatric <br>
condition, and to the distress of needing the drug.<br>
<br>
131<br>
<br>
There are very few violent types of crime with the opium addict. <br>
Our experience with the Marihuana addicts is not enough to give
an <br>
answer. I rather think that with the alcoholic-Marihuana user,
that he <br>
would become a type of drug addict that would cause many crimes. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: There was a case in Canada, Mr.
Lancaster, <br>
there a Marihuana user had withdrawal symptoms similar to those
of an <br>
opium user.<br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Yes, sir. That was the boy who was picked up and
had <br>
used Marihuana for a long time. He was out of work, had no
continual <br>
employment.<br>
He tried to smoke Marihuana, rather liked it, and after several
months <br>
of usage, he was jailed, and kept there for about a week.<br>
His case was remanded, and he reported feeling tingling pains and
<br>
needles in the hands and feet, and he was greatly upset and
pleaded for a <br>
narcotic again. He was suffering with an imparity of that order.
I do not <br>
think it was tried to see whether giving him Marihuana should
relieve that <br>
case or not.<br>
The general impression is that there is no great suffering, and
if they <br>
are relieved from it after the first five days, naturally they
want it again, <br>
but they do<br>
<br>
132<br>
<br>
not break down if they do not get it.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Bromberg, have you come across any occasion of <br>
drinking Marihuana in the form of tea extract, or something of
that sort? <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: No.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Is there any evidence of it being used in Canada? On
any <br>
convictions, have you had any evidence of it ?<br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Not there, no. No, sir, so far there have been no <br>
samples submitted to us as yet.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: None that I know of.<br>
But I understand they do mix them, mix it with sweets, in
northern <br>
Africa.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: There have been one or two reports that they do mix it
in <br>
California.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: For your ears, I can tell you, Mr. Smith, that all
of the <br>
chemists are sitting on the edge of their seats, worrying about
that <br>
happening<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: And there is a question as to the toxic effects which
could <br>
be present.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: And there may not be any way in which we can examine
<br>
it. We are hoping that they do not guess that gasoline will
extract it.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Is it true that that is a common form<br>
<br>
133<br>
<br>
in the Far East?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: No, not in The Far East, but in the Near <br>
East. <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: In the Near East, yes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We seem to have covered the sociological <br>
phases, so far as we are able to and I am going to turn the choir
over, at <br>
this point, to Dr. Wollner, who will proceed with the chemical
phases. <br>
This is where most of the spade work has got to be done, anyway. <br>
<br>
STATEMENT OF MR.. H. J. WOLLNER, <br>
CONSULTING CHEMIST, TREASURY DEPARTMENT<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The problem is not yet resolved. We are not yet in a
<br>
position to know exactly what it is we are looking for, and,
within four <br>
walls, I am perfectly frank to admit that al]. the chemists I
have met, who <br>
are interested in this field, are at a complete loss when asked
to prophesy <br>
the character of the narcotic principle, which we are going to
eventually <br>
disclose.<br>
The situation is as bad in the chemical literature as it is in
all of the <br>
other phrases.<br>
I should certainly be within the reasonable bounds of correctness
<br>
when I say that ninety percent of the stuff that has been written
on the <br>
chemical end of Can-<br>
<br>
134<br>
<br>
nabis is absolutely wrong, and, of the other ten percent, at
least two-thirds <br>
of it is of no consequence.<br>
That ninety per cent has had, however, to be dealt with, and
chemists <br>
all over the world have been interested in Cannabis, and in the
past few <br>
years have spent a goodly portion of their time upsetting a lot
of this <br>
shibboleth and tradition which has been set up, probably a
thousand years, <br>
so as to clear the ground and to be able to proceed in a more
orderly <br>
fashion.<br>
<br>
In this work the evidence, by force of circumstance, compels us
to <br>
turn to the pharmacologist for guidance.<br>
<br>
As Dr. Loewe ably expressed before, since we have no test in the <br>
chemical laboratories for indicating the presence or absence of
the <br>
narcotic principle, every bit of the exploratory work of
consequence that <br>
has been engaged upon had to be paralleled with work in the field
of bio-<br>
assay.<br>
<br>
The chemical problem is so obvious that it does not require much <br>
delineation.<br>
<br>
Chemists, enforcement administrative chemists, are interested in <br>
two things. First, and immediately, they want to know how to find
and <br>
detect the presence of Cannabis sativa, or any of its products
that are <br>
narcotic in character.<br>
<br>
In other words, most enforcement officers will make<br>
<br>
135<br>
<br>
a seizure in some form, solid or liquid, and the question asked
is, &quot;Is this <br>
Marihuana?&quot; And no satisfactory technique for answering such
a question <br>
obtains today.<br>
That does not say that in most of the cases that come before the <br>
chemists they are not in a definite position to make a definite
statement, <br>
that before them the substance is definitely Cannabis sativa, but
they can <br>
not do it as definitely as in the case of morphine, opium, and
heroin.<br>
The second question they would like answered is,<br>
&quot;What is the narcotic principle, or what are the narcotic
principles <br>
present?&quot;<br>
That question is not one of enforcement so much as of general <br>
administration.<br>
The Commissioner of Narcotics has the problem of deciding, at
times, <br>
what regulations shall be invoked in respect to an industry or an
<br>
agricultural phase of this problem.<br>
The question arises, how long shall we have to wait before the
resin <br>
is decomposed, during the rotting process, for example, and the
only way I <br>
would know how to answer that question is to know how long that
principle <br>
will exist during that rotting exhibition. Of course, we do not
know. We can <br>
not answer that question.<br>
The question arises, can recommendations be made to<br>
<br>
<br>
136<br>
<br>
exempt the use of certain portions of the plant and certain
industrial <br>
directions, as far as governmental regulation is concerned, be
given by <br>
virtue of the fact that they are harmless. No statement can he
made on that <br>
score.<br>
So, it becomes important, from an administrative point of view,
for <br>
administrative chemists, associated with the carrying out of the
Marihuana <br>
Act, to have a more competent picture of the drug, as competent
as obtains <br>
at the present time in respect to the poppy and its secretion,
opium, and its <br>
products, morphine, heroin, codeine, and so on.<br>
This drug, peculiarly enough, has withstood competent attack for
an <br>
extensive period of time.<br>
Before the laws were passed controlling the opium picture,
chemists <br>
were able to supply a fairly excellent background, against which
such <br>
legislation and regulations might have been and were in fact
predicated. <br>
But, in the case of Marihuana, there is no such background. It is
just a <br>
fog; without question the psychiatrists and bioassayists and
agricultural <br>
people know far more about Cannabis than do the chemists.<br>
So far as knowing anything about the plant, today, is concerned,
all <br>
they can tell you is that such and such<br>
<br>
137<br>
<br>
a product is not a narcotic, such and such a product is
non-narcotic, and <br>
they are trying to shrink the residue further and further, but
they have not <br>
touched it.<br>
Of great assistance in clarifying the issue has been the work <br>
undertaken by Dr. Blatt, in reviewing the literature.<br>
Dr. Blatt has prepared a paper consisting of a critical review of
the <br>
literature on narcotics, published in the journal of the
Washington Academy <br>
of Sciences on the 15th of November. I have a number of copies of
the paper <br>
here, and also a chart setting forth the general character of the
critique, so <br>
that a person who is a technical man can get a picture of the
thing.<br>
I am going to ask that only these people who have a working <br>
knowledge of chemical symbology receive them, and we will try to
get <br>
enough copies to mail them out to you later.<br>
I am going to ask Dr. Blatt if he will be so kind as to offer a
picture of <br>
his survey as to the chemical constituents of Cannabis Sativa. <br>
