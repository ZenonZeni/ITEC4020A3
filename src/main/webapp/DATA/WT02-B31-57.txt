<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>A Company of
Firsts</STRONG></FONT><P>

<STRONG>Celebrating 150 Years of Strength and Innovation</STRONG><BR>
Being a leader in the financial services industry means not resting on one's
laurels, but
continually striving for improvement.  Ours is a history notable for consistent
financial
strength as well as dynamic innovation.  For a century and a half, New York
Life's first
priority has been our policyowners' financial well-being.  To keep pace with
policyowners'
needs, the Company has launched new products, enhanced product features,
expanded quality
service, and pioneered new technologies.  Breaking new ground is part of the
New York Life
tradition.  That's what makes us "A Company of Firsts."<P>
<UL>
<STRONG>Unsurpassed Financial Strength</STRONG><BR>
<EM>1845 - New York Life declares the <STRONG>first</STRONG> cash dividend
ever
paid to
policyowners in America</EM><BR>
<UL>As a mutual insurer, New York Life is owned by its policyowners.  And
virtually every
year since its inception, New York Life has declared dividends to those policyowners - nearly
$23 billion in total.  In 1995, New York Life made the highest total
dividends
distribution in our history -- approximately $1.19 billion. </UL><P>

<EM>1899 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> American life
insurance company
to publish a detailed financial report for its policyowners</EM><BR>

<UL>Early financial reports showed a Company with a strong foundation and a
promising future. 
Starting modestly with assets of $17,000 in 1845, the Company has grown to over 
$74 billion in consolidated assets, with over $449 billion of life insurance in
force.<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP></FONT>  Those first financial reports
showed a
company with a sound, conservative investment philosophy.  Today, we remain
true to that
prudent approach to investing.  Three-quarters of our assets are invested in
bonds, with 94%
of that bond portfolio held in investment grade bonds.  </UL><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Consolidated figures of
New
York Life 
Insurance
Company, including its direct, wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries, New
York Life
Insurance and Annuity Corporation, New York Life and Health Insurance Company,
and NYLIFE
Insurance Company of Arizona. </FONT></UL>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Our Commitment to Our Customers</STRONG><BR>
<EM>1894 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> United States
company to issue
life insurance to women at the same rates as men</EM><BR>

<UL>Susan B. Anthony, the 19th-century American social reformer, believed
strongly that if
women were to achieve political equality, they had to be financially
independent.  She was
one of the first women to own an insurance policy, and her insurer was New York
Life.</UL><P>

<EM>1896 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to
insure
people with
physical impairments or hazardous occupations</EM><BR>

<UL>Using a scientific basis to evaluate people with substandard risks, New
York Life was
able to issue policies to people previously considered uninsurable.  This
innovation --
praised by experts at the time as the single greatest advancement in life
insurance -- 
enabled millions of people (who in the past would have been declined) to qualify
for life
insurance and protect their families' financial future.</UL> <P>

<STRONG>Adding Value and Flexibility to Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>

<EM>1860 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to issue
policies
containing a "non-forfeiture option"</EM><BR>

<UL>Before any state law required it, New York Life developed the
non-forfeiture option,
which formed the foundation of guaranteed cash values found in policies today. 
This feature
enables a policy to remain in force even when a premium payment is
inadvertently missed. 
Today, policyowners have various ways to apply cash values to prevent their
policies from
lapsing.  Typically, the options include automatic premium loan, extended term
insurance, and
reduced paid-up insurance.</UL><P>

<EM>1892 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> major company to
issue policies
with an incontestable clause</EM>

<UL>To give policyowners even more peace of mind, New York Life sets a time
limit on the
insurer's right to dispute a policy's validity based on material misstatements
made in the
application.</UL><P>

<EM>1920 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to issue
a
policy with a
disability benefit that presumes  total disability to be permanent after a
predetermined
number of months</EM><BR>

<UL>New York Life has long been a leader in liberal insurance concepts.  The
Company provides
a benefit that waives premiums when the insured is disabled for a predetermined
period of
time.</UL><P>

<EM>1948 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> non-industrial
company to offer
family insurance</EM><BR>

<UL>The Company helps families by introducing a family insurance plan offering
coverage on
all members of a family under one policy.</UL><P>

<EM>1956 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to offer
the convenience
of Check-O-Matic premium payments</EM><BR>

<UL>This innovation relieves policyowners of the burdensome task of writing a
check to make
premium payments.  Policyowners can now authorize New York Life to draw funds
directly from
their bank accounts to pay premiums each month.</UL><P>


<EM>1992 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> major insurer to
offer policies
with an Unemployment Rider</EM><BR>

<UL>To help aid policyowners through hard times, this no-cost rider offers to
waive premiums
if policyowners become unemployed for a predetermined period of time. 
Earlier, the Company
introduced the Living Benefits Rider.  Should an insured become terminally ill,
this rider
provides for a benefit payment that can be used to pay medical expenses during
this
difficult time.</UL><P>

<STRONG>Our Focus on Quality Service</STRONG><BR>

<EM>1892 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> insurer to
organize
a Branch
Office System</EM>

<UL>To provide the highest possible level of service to our expanding customer
base, the
Company established an integrated network of General Offices across the
country.  Today, these
"G.O.s" serve our nearly 11,000 agents.  We believe this highly trained
team of
dedicated professionals is our most valuable asset.  Our agents have been
honored by the
industry for outstanding service to their clients, and New York Life has
consistently led the
industry in membership in the Million Dollar Round Table, an organization
devoted to promoting
 exemplary ethical standards of the insurance industry.</UL><P>


<EM>1989 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> insurer to require
continuing
education for its agents</EM>

<UL>To provide agents with the knowledge they require to keep pace with the
rapidly changing
financial services marketplace, the Company launched NYLIC University in
January 1995.  This
program is designed to give uniform, comprehensive training to both new and
established
agents. In addition, many agents have successfully met stringent academic
standards, earning
prestigious professional designations such as CLU, ChFC, and MSFS.</UL><P>


<EM>1990 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> major insurance
company to offer
whole life policyowners an "Owner's Manual"</EM>

<UL>New York Life has always sought to educate the public about the workings
and various
benefits of life insurance.  Beginning in 1895 with the introduction of the
"Golden Policy,"
all of our policies have been written in concise, plain language, not
"insurance-ese."  The
Whole Life "Owner's Manual," an easy-to-read guidebook available to our
policyowners, 
continues this tradition.  Through its newsletters, <EM>intouch</EM> and
<EM>inbusiness</EM>, as
well as the
in-depth discussions in the <EM>Concept Papers</EM> series, New York Life seeks to
provide its
customers with timely information regarding life insurance and financial
issues.</UL>
