<B>Hiawatha First Nation To Govern Serpent Mounds Park</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Chief of the Hiawatha First Nation and the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources have stated that effective April 1, 1996, the Government of Ontario will no longer lease Serpent Mounds Park.<P>

"Given the current value of the Serpent Mounds property, the province can no longer afford to continue to operate the park and provide fair compensation to the First Nation for use of the land," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>

"My ministry is turning over all the park's fixed assets to the Hiawatha First Nation, and should the First Nation be in a position to operate the park, our staff will assist, where possible, in setting up the park operation to create an economic development opportunity for the community," added Mr. Hodgson.<P>

The parties agree that the park offers an excellent economic opportunity for the First Nation and surrounding communities.<P>

"Should financing be forthcoming, Hiawatha is looking forward to operating the park, keeping it open to visitors and protecting the area as a natural site which has cultural, historical and spiritual significance to Native peoples throughout North America," said Hiawatha First Nation Chief Frank Cowie. <P>

Serpent Mounds Park is located south of Highway 7 near Rice Lake and the village of Keene.  Owned by the Hiawatha First Nation, the site has been leased by the province for the past 41 years to operate as a provincial park.<P>

The park is named for ancient Aboriginal burial mounds found in the area.  The Serpent Mounds site is unique in Canada.  Nine burial mounds located in the park enclose the remains of Aboriginal people who gathered on the shores of Rice Lake more than 2,000 years ago.  Six of the mounds combine to form the shape of a serpent.<P>
