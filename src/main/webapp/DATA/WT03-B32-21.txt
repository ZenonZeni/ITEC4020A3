Competition sharpens in PC conferencing market+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Competition is intensifying in Japan's personal computer (PC)
market as the age of PC conferencing approaches, industry sources
said Friday.
     Like teleconferences, PC conferences enable participants at
distant locations to engage in discussions through the displays on
their personal computers.
     However, PC conferences are less expensive than teleconferences,
as they do not require large display screens.
     The sources said domestic and foreign electronics makers have
entered the market in which sales of PC conference terminals are
estimated at 3 million units in fiscal 1995.
     Two U.S. electronics makers, PictureTel Corp. and Compac Corp.,
teamed up last summer to enter Japan's PC conference market, while
the world's largest semiconductor maker Intel Corp. will market a new
system for PC conferences.
     Japan's top PC maker NEC Corp. has introduced a new system in a
bid to dominate the market, the sources said.
     Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's largest consumer
electronics maker, plans to introduce its own system featuring a
built-in, multifunction camera.
     They will be joined by other Japanese and U.S. competitors, such
as Japan's top mainframe computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. and Apple
Computer Inc. of the United States, the sources said.

Powerful magnet for VCR motors, computer HDD developed+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Aichi Steel Works Ltd. said Monday it has developed a new
magnet for use in videocassette recorder (VCR) motors and computer
hard disk drives (HDD) that is capable of providing 70% more energy
than that of the most powerful conventional magnet.
     The new magnet, ''Magfine 17,'' is an anisotropic magnet made
of the magnetic powders of neodymium and plastic.  The new product
provides energy at 17 mega gauss-oersteds (mgo) compared with 10 mgo
provided by the most powerful conventional isotropic magnet, the
company said.
     The company will start marketing the product next month.
     The new technology involves heating and consolidating the
magnetic powders by taking advantage of the critical ''moment'' when
melted plastic becomes liquid, an Aichi official said.
     With the technology, Aichi Steel has succeeded in arranging the
all particles of neodymium in the same direction, he said.
     For the time being, the product will be integrated into VCR
motors to move the magnetic heads of a VCR and magnetic sensors, it
said.
     Expectations are high that the new magnet will be integrated
into the CD-ROMs and HDDs of notebook personal computers, he added.

NEC develops new voice info system+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     NEC Corp. has developed a new voice information system that
uses flash memory microchips and can record up to four hours of
voice data, a company official said Tuesday.
     With the new system, voice data is compressed from 64 kilobits
per second to 16 kilobits and transformed into digital data, the
official said.
     The compressed data is recorded on a 32-megabit flash memory
chip installed in ''Chip Whisper,'' a business card-size device newly
developed by NEC, the official said.
     A flash memory chip, an electrically erasable programmable
read-only memory, is able to record 30 minutes of voice data, he
said.  Because they retain data even when the power is turned off,
they are popular for portable products such as notebook personal
computers.
     NEC will preview Chip Whisper at a Tokyo art gallery in January,
and visitors will be able to use the system to hear recorded
explanations about the works on display via an earphone.
     Some galleries previously used frequency modulation (FM)
broadcasting or dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, but the
NEC system is more practical because it does not require broadcasting
equipment and can convert data more easily than a DRAM system, the
official said.
     Chip Whisper can contain up to eight flash memory chips, which
would allow for recording of up to four hours of voice data.  NEC is
considering marketing the new system for such purposes as foreign
language learning, the official said.

Softbank to acquire U.S. publisher through bond issue+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japanese computer software wholesaler Softbank Corp. said
Tuesday it will issue 70 billion yen worth of convertible bonds to
raise funds for the acquisition of a U.S. publishing house.
     The Tokyo-based company said it has signed an agreement to take
over New York-based Ziff-Davis Public Co. and its holding company for
1.8 billion dollars.
     The entire proceeds from the bond issue will be used for the
acquisition, the company said.
     The price of the bonds, due on March 29, 2002, will be fixed
later, it said.  The deadline for subscription payments has been set
for Jan. 26.

Sega, Matsushita deny report on video game format+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
denied a news report Friday that they have reached an agreement to
standardize specifications for next-generation home video game
equipment.
     The companies' spokesmen said separately that home video
equipment makers are in general examining such possibilities, but no
specific negotiations or developments have been made between the two
companies.
     The denial followed a report by the mass circulation daily
Yomiuri Shimbun that the two firms have reached an agreement to
standardize specifications of their 64-bit video game machines by
next fall to effectively compete with the largest player Nintendo Co.
     The daily reported that Matsushita has already supplied a newly
developed 64-bit machine to Sega for feasibility studies.
     When the specifications are set, the companies plan to ask other
video game manufacturers to adopt them, the daily said, adding that
using the same specifications will help them reduce development costs.
     About 10 manufacturers are currently competing in the field, and
their products are essentially incompatible with each other.

Digital cameras making inroads into consumer mart+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Digital still cameras, once reserved for professional use, are
now filtering into the consumer market on active personal computer
sales, but whether they can emerge as a strong ''new kid on the
block'' in the computer peripherals sector hinges on how far prices
drop.
     Casio Computer Co., primarily a digital watch and calculator
maker, made a splash in the digital still camera market in February,
when it debuted a model priced at 65,000 yen, undercutting prices of
100,000 yen or more for models offered mainly by conventional camera
makers.
     ''The company had no intention to instigate price busting in the
digital camera market,'' says Koichi Nishizawa of Casio's public
relations section.
     The attractive pricing, and a built-in liquid crystal display
which serves as a viewfinder and monitor, however, earned the model
instant popularity.
     ''Monthly production has already hit 20,000 cameras and is
expected to reach 30,000 in early 1996, compared with the initial
pace of 3,000,'' Nishizawa noted.
     Casio expects the world market for digital cameras costing
around 100,000 yen or less to total just more than 300,000 cameras in
the year through March, of which 200,000 will be made by the company.
     It forecasts total shipments to hit one million cameras in 1996,
according to Nishizawa.
     Digital cameras do not use conventional photosensitive film but
capture images with a charge-coupled device (CCD), which turns optic
signals into electronic ones, and store photos digitally on built-in
flash memory chips or cards mounted with such chips.
     The new gadget saves users the trouble of developing film, while
enabling them to readily transfer photographic data into personal
computers (PCs) for monitoring, image processing, printouts and
on-line transmissions.
     The proliferation of PCs is essential for consumer-use digital
cameras to penetrate into the consumer market.  ''Some 90% of QV-10
clients are using the product with computers,'' Nishizawa said.
     Digital cameras, for instance, allow individual PC users to
produce custom-designed greeting cards with photos, compile databases
with visual information and take in pictures more easily for Internet
home pages than with conventional photo scanners.
     Corporate users have also found value in the camera.  Insurance
agents are taking digital shots of accident sites for on-line
transmissions to the head office to evaluate payments, while housing
and used-car dealers are compiling easy-to-edit digital catalogues.
     Inspired by Casio's success, electrical appliance makers Sanyo
Electric Co. and Sharp Corp. are poised to separately tap the budding
consumer-use digital camera market with promising growth potential.
     Sanyo will begin supplying its products to a U.S. computer
peripherals maker later this month under an original equipment
manufacturing contract, while Sharp is studying the possibility of
launching a consumer-use model, spokesmen for the companies said.
     Casio's Nishizawa concedes concern over appliance makers'
expected entry into the market, saying, ''The noncamera makers will
likely market digital cameras in much the same style as Casio has,
thereby clashing head on with us.''
     Among conventional camera makers, Chinon Industries Inc. expects
to put out a digital camera priced below 50,000 yen in February, a
spokesman said.  The company currently sells a 140,000 yen model
equipped with a zoom lens and a close-up photography mode.
     Most camera makers, though, seem to have reservations as yet
about offering models costing below 100,000 yen because they do not
want to compromise picture quality, says Yasuharu Hirose, head of the
Japan Camera Industry Association's general management division.
     The resolution of digital photos depends largely on the number
of CCD pixels, which totals 1.3 million to six million in models
costing millions of yen and used primarily by the media, the printing
industry and professional photographers -- the initial digital camera
users.
     Casio could lower the price of the QV-10 chiefly because it
adopted a 250,000-pixel CCD, compared with 410,000-pixel CCDs used in
rival 100,000 yen-plus models offered by Ricoh Co., Olympus Optical
Co., Kodak Japan Ltd. and other companies.
     Faced with user complaints over the QV-10's picture quality,
Casio will consider raising the number of pixels as it expands its
digital camera line, Nishizawa said.  The company plans to offer a
second model in the spring, he added.
     Camera makers are also cautious about low-end models because
they could eat away at sales of traditional compact cameras, while
''Casio and other noncamera makers have no product that directly
competes with digital cameras,'' Hirose of the industry group said.
     Proponents of low-priced models, however, argue that digital and
traditional cameras are two different products.
     ''Low-priced digital cameras should not be compared with
traditional cameras,'' says Hiroshi Morozumi, supervisor of Chinon's
marketing and sales department.  ''Their picture quality in print
pales even in comparison with that of disposable cameras.''
     Casio shares that view.  ''Our digital camera is such a casual
tool that you can take a visual note of a train schedule at the
station and erase it when you no longer need it,'' Nishizawa said.
''But conventional cameras are more for appreciating pictures
themselves.''
     The tide, however, seems to be turning toward low-priced models
in the digital camera market.  Camera maker Nikon Corp., which has
concentrated on digital models selling for 1 million to 1.4 million
yen, said it is considering releasing a consumer-use model selling
for 100,000 yen or less.
     ''Casio's model showed (consumer-use) digital cameras wouldn't
budge at conventional prices,'' says Masaki Isogai, manager of the
planning section of Nikon's electronic imaging division.  ''The price
is a key problem for consumer-use models.''
     With Japan's PC shipments estimated to have topped five million
in 1995, compared with 3.4 million in 1994, digital camera makers
expect their products to stand a good chance of appealing to a
broader spectrum of PC users.
     However, Chinon's Morozumi says, ''The price will have to come
down to 10% to 20% of computers themselves if digital cameras are to
be counted as a computer peripheral.''
     It is not just the price, though, that companies have to be
concerned with.  ''Digital camera makers need to propose what fun the
users can have with the product by, for instance, offering the camera
and image-processing software as a package,'' he said.
