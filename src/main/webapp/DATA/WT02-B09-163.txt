<h2 align=center>Text of Introduction &amp; Rebuttal by Eric Garris, 
<br>Director of Republicans for Proposition 215, 
<br>in Debate with California Attorney General Dan Lungren </h2>

<p><b>Broadcast KSFO Radio October 31, 1996</b> </p>

<p>I would like to start with a quote from a well-known individual: (quote)
&quot;our outdated federal prohibition is depriving thousands of glaucoma
and cancer patients of medical care. We believe licensed physicians are
competent to employ marijuana, and patients have a right to obtain marijuana
legally, under medical supervision. The medical prohibition does not prevent
seriously ill patients from employing marijuana; it simply deprives them
of medical supervision. Physicians are forced to choose between their ethical
responsibilities to the patient and their legal liabilities to bureaucrats.&quot;
(unquote) Who do you think said this? Some liberal? No. These are the words
of Congressman Newt Gingrich in a letter he wrote in support of a bill
he introduced in 1981 to legalize medical marijuana. </p>

<p>I represent Republicans for Proposition 215, the medical marijuana measure
on next Tuesday's ballot. Our supporters include former U.S. Secretary
of State George Schultz, Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman,
National Review Senior Editor Richard Brookhiser, former gubernatorial
candidate Ron Unz, Chris Norby, the Mayor of Fullerton, and dozens of local
Republican clubs who support Proposition 215. </p>

<p>We are Republicans in the tradition of Ronald Reagan. We support smaller
government, lower taxes, and less government regulation of business and
individual rights. As Republicans, we do not believe that medical policies
should be made by politicians and bureaucrats. </p>

<p>Proposition 215 will not legalize marijuana. Only licensed physicians,
as defined under state law, will be able to recommend marijuana to their
patients. Prop. 215 is meant to be an interim measure. First, it calls
on the Congress and State Legislature to enact and institutionalize a system
for providing marijuana for patients who have had it prescribed by their
doctors. Until this happens, it prevents the prosecution of patients who
use and grow marijuana for their own medical use. It protects doctors from
being prosecuted for advising their patients to use a drug they feel would
be the best treatment for their condition. </p>

<p>A Harvard University study conducted of members of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology found that almost half of Oncologists, cancer specialists,
have advised patients to use marijuana to counter the side effects of chemotherapy.
The Drug Enforcement Administration's own Law Judge, Francis Young, ruled
in 1988 that marijuana is an effective form of medicine for a variety of
ailments and that it should be legalized for medical purposes. The bureaucrats
at the DEA overruled Judge Young's decision. </p>

<p>Proposition 215 is supported by medical organizations representing 38,000
California doctors and nurses. The California Academy of Family Physicians,
the American Public Health Association, the California Nurses Association,
the California Nurses Alliance, the San Francisco Medical Society, and
the Los Angeles County AIDS Commission all endorse Proposition 215. Public
health officials from counties and cities all over the state have endorsed
215. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society of Northern California supports
Prop. 215. Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest HMOs in the state, recently
added smoking marijuana to their list of recommended medications which
should be administered to patients with AIDS wasting syndrome. </p>

<p>Prop. 215 is supported by Senior Citizens. The Older Women's League
of California, the Congress of California Seniors, the California Senior
Legislature, and the California Legislative Council for Older Americans
all support Prop. 215's passage November 5. Seniors support Proposition
215 because they are the most frequent sufferers of glaucoma, cancer, and
the other diseases treated by medical marijuana. </p>

<p>Proposition 215 is endorsed by all ten major Bay Area daily newspapers.
And the first newspaper in the state to endorse Prop. 215, before it even
qualified for the ballot, was the Orange County Register, the flagship
paper of conservative Republicans in Southern California. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Rebuttal </p>

<p>If Prop. 215 passes, California would not become the first state to
allow marijuana to be used by patients. Last year, Ohio passed a bill very
similar to Prop. 215, allowing patients to grow and use marijuana on the
advice of their doctors. If arrested and prosecuted, patients could defend
themselves by proving medical need--the same provision as in Prop. 215.
In addition, the Supreme Courts of Florida and Idaho recently ruled that
medical marijuana-using patients are exempt from criminal penalties. In
these three states, there has been no increase in marijuana use since the
laws have changed. Yet California continues to arrest thousands of people
who grow and use marijuana for their own medical purposes. </p>

<p>It could be worse. In Oklahoma, paraplegic James Montgomery is currently
serving a ten-year prison sentence for possession of two ounces of marijuana
he used to control seizures from his spinal cord injury. In Iowa, Jan Pleas,
mother of two with glaucoma, faces five years in prison for possession
of her medicine. Or the cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy given a
prescription for the huge, expensive, and often ineffective capsule known
as Marinol. These patients are so nauseous that they can't keep anything
down, and too broke to afford the $30,000 a year the drug costs. The worst
part is, a cheaper and more effective alternative exists. </p>

<p>Prop. 215 does not repeal any existing laws against the sale, use, or
cultivation of marijuana for non-medical purposes. Selling or growing marijuana,
driving under the influence of marijuana, or using marijuana for non-medical
purposes would still be a crime. In fact, police would be free to arrest
and prosecute anyone whom they feel is engaged in the improper use or distribution
of marijuana. Prop. 215 would allow medical necessity as a defense in court,
not against the power of police to conduct normal law enforcement duties.
It would be up to the courts to decide in each case, whether medical necessity
is a valid defense in that particular case. Prop. 215 calls upon Congress
and the State Legislature to implement a rational system for allowing sick
people to obtain the drug prescribed to them by their doctors. </p>

<p>The opponents of Prop. 215 will tell you that no study has shown the
efficacy of marijuana as medicine. This is simply not true. Scores of studies
have shown that marijuana is effective for a number of ailments, including
glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and for counteracting the nausea
caused by chemotherapy for cancer and AIDS. Even studies done by opponents
to prove their point have produced the opposite results. For example, in
1970, a study done at UCLA for the Los Angeles Police Department, intending
to show that marijuana damaged eyesight, instead showed that marijuana
reduced pressure within the eyeball. This led to the discovery that marijuana
is effective as a remedy for glaucoma. </p>

<p>In 1975, Doctor Donald Tashkin at UCLA Medical Center did a double-blind
scientific study on the effects of smoking marijuana to relieve acute bronchospasm
in asthma patients. The results, published in the American Review of Respiratory
Disease, stated &quot;the results appear to support the benefit ascribed
to the use of cannabis in the last century for the treatment of bronchial
asthma.&quot; Dr. Tashkin stated that unlike other medications which can
take 20 to 30 minutes to act, &quot;one toke of marijuana relieves an asthma
attack immediately.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1987, Republican Governor George Duekmejian appointed the California
Research Advisory Panel to conduct the Cannabis Therapeutic Research Study.
They performed rigorous testing with full scientific protocols and found
great benefit to chemotherapy patients smoking marijuana. Although this
study was funded by the state, the findings were suppressed. Had the State
of California submitted this study to the FDA it could have been used to
garner FDA approval for marijuana. But the politicians killed it, and the
new studies that need to get done are being stopped by political agendas.
Just last month, the federal government denied permission to the University
of California, San Francisco Medical Center to do a study on marijuana
and AIDS. In fact, the federal government has denied permission for every
study on the medicinal effects of marijuana proposed in the last fifteen
years. For the opponents to say that no federally-approved studies support
the proponents' arguments, while the federal government has refused to
sanction any studies, is disingenuous and classic government Catch-22.
It is typical bureaucratic double-speak.</p>
