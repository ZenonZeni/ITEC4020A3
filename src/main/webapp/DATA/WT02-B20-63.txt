  This study, involving 4 children (ages 6 and 11) with autism, demonstrated 
that a self-management technique was effective in improving responsiveness to 
verbal initiations from others and in extending responsiveness to settings 
(community, home, and school) without the presence of a treatment provider.  
Concomitant reductions in disruptive behavior were also observed.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Four district brochures presenting guidelines on services for children and 
adults with autism have been combined to form this document.  "General 
Guidelines for Education and Treatment of Individuals with Autism" addresses 
aspects of education and treatment, listing important questions about such 
topics as ancillary services, indivdualization, home programming, and 
accreditation.  "Guidelines Pertaining to Adult Day Training/Workshops" 
examines adult day training/workshops, and touches upon such issues as the need 
for distinct services, individualized planning, and the philosophy of training 
and programming.  "Guidelines Pertaining to Group Homes for Children and 
Adults" covers issues of community resources, individualization, staff 
training, and the role of the parents.  In the fourth brochure, guidelines are 
offered for the selection of an appropriate educational placement for students 
with autism.  Areas addressed are classroom environment and structure, 
student/staff ratio, teaching methods, progress evaluation, accountability, 
related services, and personal reactions.  (CL)<BR>

  The booklet provides background information on the diagnosis and 
characteristics of autism.  A chart portrays the signs and symptoms, followed 
by the definition of the syndrome by the National Society For Children and 
Adults with Autism.  Associated features are noted along with information on 
age of onset, etiology, incidence and sex ratio, complications, and 
differential diagnosis.  The diagnostic criteria put forth by the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition) DSM-III are also 
presented in terms of associated features, age at onset, course, impairment, 
complications, prevalence, sex ratio, predisposing factors, familial pattern, 
and differential diagnosis.  Typical behaviors, such as unusual response to 
sound and unusual speech patterns, are listed.  Programmatic requirements, 
including early diagnosis and appropriate intervention, highly structured 
programs, and comprehensive home programming/parent training, are summarized.  
A brochure entitled "Questions and Answers," which presents practical questions 
and answers on autism is attached.  (CL)<BR>

  This monograph describes the program of the Language and Cognitive 
Development Center (Massachusetts), which serves toddlers and school-aged 
children with autism or other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD).  An 
introduction presents incidence figures, the program's philosophy, the 
program's approach to assessment, intervention with children having limited 
reality systems, approaches to generalization of training, dealing with 
behavior problems, and the program's unique approach to teaching language.  
Next, a discussion of cognitive-developmental systems theory examines child 
development in terms of the sign stage of development (0-18 months), formation 
and dynamics of reality systems during the sign stage, and the development of 
intention during the sign stage.  Intervention is then considered, including 
the program's "Umwelt" approach to the evaluation of reality systems, 
correcting developmental dysfunctions, developing body schema, coping with 
surroundings, developing social contact, and developing communication and 
representation skills.  The integration of skills learned in the Center into 
the home environment is then explained.  A final discussion answers questions 
concerning the curriculum for school-age nonverbal or limited verbal PDD 
children, examines determinants of child success, and offers evidence of the 
program's success (48 percent of Center children have returned to the public 
school mainstream for all or part of their classes).  (Contains 53 references.)

  A case study of a 3-year-old autistic child and her family is presented, 
following the child through a 3-year intensive intervention program with a 
multidisciplinary team in a day treatment program.  The day treatment program 
plan included academic goals, language goals, parental goals, and home training 
goals.  A major component of the program was the family's participation in a 
behavior-based developmental model training course.  The document presents the 
child's developmental history, school history, and early intervention 
strategies.  A follow-up study 5 years after leaving the day treatment program 
found that the child had made apparent cognitive and behavioral improvements.  
Her language skills remained weak and her eye contact limited, and she 
exhibited little spontaneity.  Her parents retained and used the skills learned 
from their earlier participation in the parent training course.  Family 
counseling was recommended to aid in meeting the challenge of parenting an 
adolescent and to establish long-term educational and vocational goals.  Seven

  This investigation compared self-talk use in five preschool autistic children 
(ages 57 to 86 months) and in matched chronological age and mental age peer 
groups.  Videotape recordings of the children during free play with and without 
an adult were coded for the following self-talk categories: (1) private, 
mastery speech; (2) stereotypic repetitions; (3) word play; (4) self-regulative 
speech; (5) utterances; and (6) mouthing of words.  All three groups exhibited 
fewer instances of self-talk in the presence of adults than without an adult.  
The autistic children demonstrated a similar pattern of self-talk with adults 
as did their control peers.  Autistic children showed less consistency in 
behaviors between the adult present and adult absent situation than did 
controls; this was not felt to reflect their lack of response to adults in 
their environment, but rather to the high production of utterances and private 
mastery talk when they were not with an adult.  (Contains six figures/tables.)

  Preschool children with autism (n=9) and their normally developing peers 
(n=9) were compared before and after one school year.  The autistic children 
had narrowed the gap after treatment--making a nearly 19-point increase in 
intelligence quotient and an 8-point gain in language quotient.  Results 
support the value of a language enriched early intervention program.  (DB)<BR>

  This study investigated the communicative behavior of five high-level and 
five low-level autistic children (ages 3-5 years).  Differential responses of 
parents and a clinician to the children's protesting, responses, and 
initiations were assessed.  Findings indicate differential interaction behavior 
and behavior problems of autistic children with their parents and a clinician.  
Both groups of autistic children reacted quite sensitively to different 
interaction partners and their communicative feedback.  Low-level autistic 
children mainly used nonverbal protests when interacting with their parents.  
Parents tended to respond to appropriate communicative acts with new demands, 
while the clinician acknowledged the communication.  Reassessment of the low-
level group after 20 months of daily therapy showed a significant reduction of 
protests and noncompliance and an increase in parents' positive feedback.
