DEUTSCHE TELEKOM BOASTS OF 16.4 MILLION CABLE TV SUBSCRIBERS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Deutsche Telekom announced on October 21 that 16.4 million homes were
connected to its cable television network as of September 30. The leading
cable operator in Germany, Deutsche Telekom has gained 571,000 new
customers since the beginning of the year. The number of cable ready
households has also increased since January, to 24.7 million in Germany as
a whole (compared to 24.2 million at the beginning of the year). As of
late September, 66.1% of German households were ready for connection to
the cable network, compared to 64,7% in early 1996. Of this proportion,
66.3% were actually subscribing, according to Deutsche Telekom. At the
current rate, 95% of the telecommunications network will be digitized by
the end of the year, the company further noted.

MOBISTAR RECORDS 20,000 SUBSCRIBERS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Mobistar, a Belgian company, in which France Telecom has the controlling
stake, now has a total of 20,000 subscribers six weeks after its launch
date. This news was announced by the company management on October 22,
during the official opening of this, the second Belgian mobile telephone
network. In the month of September alone, the company had a list of 10,000
subscribers and the advertising campaign had not even got underway, says
Bernard Ghillebaert, who is hoping to have 40,000 subscribers by the end
of the year. Proximus was brought into service nearly two years ago. In
order to be able to operate the network, Mobistar had to pay the Belgian
authorities a fee of FEB 9 billion (FF1.5 billion or USD300 million). The
network installation costs are put at FEB 6 billion (FF one million or
USD200 million). Mobistar is one of the few foreign companies in which
France Telecom has a share of more than 50%. We generally get established
with a local partner by taking a stake in the region of 30%, said France
Telecom's Chairman, Michel Bon, who attended Mobistar's opening ceremony
in Brussels. France Telecom's consolidated turnover in the foreign mobile
telephone sector is put at FF 700 million. The trading figures amount to
1.4 billion if minority shares are taken into account. The French business
is hoping to double its sales in this sector in 1997. When Mobistar was
launched, last August 27, its rates were 35% cheaper than Proximus's.
Three days after, the Belgian operator announced a sizeable cut in rates
to be able to compete with the newcomer. France Telecom has a 57% stake in
Mobistar, Telinfo of Belgium 10% and a group of Belgian investors 33%.
Mobistar covers 95% of the Belgian population and 58% of the Belgian
territory.

EUTELSAT OPEN NEW HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The new headquarters of the European satellite telecommunications
organisation, EUTELSAT, was officially opened on October 22, in Paris by
Jean Grenier, its Managing Director. The opening ceremony was attended by
Francois Fillon, the French Minister for Postal Services,
Telecommunications and Space. Ever since the organisation was created, in
1977, its headquarters have comprised four floors in the Tour
Montparnasse. It is now moving to a brand new building (9,000 square
meres,) built on 2,200 m2 of land (belonging to the City of Paris) on the
edge of the Andre-Citroen park. Nearly 300 people of 18 different
nationalities are now employed there to help in the task of running
EUTELSAT's fleet. Come November 13 the organisation will be launching the
Hot Bird-2 satellite, which is set to come into service in early December.
It will be positioned 13 degrees longitude east, alongside Hot Bird-1 and
EUTELSAT-II-F1. Mr Grenier says TV programmes (accounting for 70% of
EUTELSAT's turnover) transmitted by the organisation's satellites may
currently be received (by aerial or cable) by a bit more than 60 million
households in Europe (500,000 in France). Minister Fillon hailed the
success of EUTELSAT, which is now handling more than 160 channels,
including 40 digital ones. In reference to the requirement for all EU
Member States to open up their telecommunications industries by January 1,
1998, he said he could not but hail EUTELSAT's strategic options and its
aspiration to provide satellite coverage that far transcends the borders
of its member countries so as to be able to operate on a global scale in
due course.

ITALY TO PRIVATISE STET IN FEBRUARY/MARCH

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

STET, Italy's Government-owned telecommunications group is set to be
privatised as planned in February/March 1997, European Commissioner Karel
van Miert for Competition announced on October 4, on the sidelines of a
competition and antitrust conference staged in Rome. If Italy loses the
opportunity to privatise STETwithin the prescribed period, between
February and March next year, it might have to wait until the end of 1997
for an other suitable period, according to the Commissioner. Brussels is
said to be awaiting a signal from the Italian Government about the
privatisation programme. The Commissioner also came out in favour of a
six-month extension to the agreement between the Government-owned group
IRI (one of STET's shareholders) and the European Commission, rather than
the one year period sought by the Italian authorities. Under the terms of
the agreement, IRI has to cut its debt to L 4,500-5,000 billion (roughly
USD2.9 to 3.3 billion) by the end of 1996. IRI has been unable to stick to
the undertaking owing to the hold up with the privatisation drive. The
Commissioner also spoke about the Commission decision to open an inquiry
into the funding of L 1,500 billion being earmarked for the IRI in 1997 to
compensate for the group's financing activities for the Alitalia airline.
We have to examine this operation to see if state aid is involved, said
the Commissioner.

PHILIPS AND FLAT SCREENS ALLIANCE

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The Dutch electronics giant, Philips, is planning to join forces with the
Japanese group Hosiden from Osaka (central Japan) in the flat screens
sector using AMLCD liquid crystals technology. Philips has declined to
reveal the amount of money being invested into this future joint venture
in which both groups will have an equal stake. The cooperation will also
involve technoloogical exchange contracts and agreements for the sales of
goods using the AMLCD technology. Philips sees the cooperation with the
Japanese group as an opportunity to take advantage of Hosiden's leading
position in this field and to allow the Dutch group easier access to the
Japanese equipment industry. Philips has a flat screens technology
facility in Eindhoven, in the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dutch
group is unable to say yet how the deal with Hosiden will affect the 580
jobs at the Eindhoven plant. Worth USD4.6 billion in 1995, the AMLCD flat
screens market is set to almost triple by the year 2001, according to
Philips. AMLCD technology may be used for the manufacture of portable
computers, miniature TV sets and car navigation systems.

Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), the Italian public mobile telephone company,
has announced that it has 4.9 million subscribers. This figure includes
subscribers to the TACS analog system as well as to the European standard
GSM system. TIM claims to have 1.1 million subscribers to its GSM
services, or 70% of Italian subscribers to this standard. The company
reached a point of equilibrium in the GSM sector in June, TIM's Managing
Director, Massimo Sarmi, said.

UNILOG'S NET PROFITS DOWN 11.42% IN FIRST HALF 1996

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Unilog, a consulting and computer engineering firm, announced on October
22 that its net consolidated profits were 11.42% lower for the first half
of 1996, at 12.4 million French Francs, than the 14 million Francs
recorded a year earlier. Total after tax turnover rose by 3.74% during the
same period, to 378.458 million FF, compared to 364.819 in 1995. For 1996,
consolidated turnover is expected to increase by about 10% due to a new
60/40 distribution of turnover between Paris and the other French regions,
where Unilog has expanded. The group undertook two operations involving
external expansion: the takeover of two agencies of the Easys Informatique
company (part of the Sinorg group) focusing on the industrial and banking
sectors (turnover of 20 million FF) and seven computer engineering
agencies of Alcatel TITN Answare (with 138 million FF in turnover). Unilog
has also acquired new capabilities in the areas of industrial
computerization and telecommunications, thereby preparing for the
transition to the Euro and the 21st century, the group said in a statement.

MANNESMANN MOBILFUNK CHEAPER THAN DEUTSCHE TELEKOM

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which operates D2, the second largest digital mobile
telephone network in Germany, announced on October 15 plans to cut its
rates at the end of October to below those of its public competitor,
Deutsche Telekom's D1. Less than ten days after Deutsche Telekom promised
a new lower rate to take effect on November 4, Mannesmann Mobilfunk
counterattacked, indicating that it would establish two new rates that
would be lower than its current rates, but only to customers who
subscribed for at least 24 months. The basic subscription (D2Fun 24) costs
24.95 DM, compared to 29 DM for Deutsche Telekom's Telly D1 Eco service.
The old version of D2 Fun 24 cost 49.90 DM. The cost of a new subscription
for private customers is "equivalent to that of a subscription to
conventional non mobile services", Mannesmann Mobilfunk emphasised. For
commercial customers (whose service is known as D2 Classic 24), the price
per minute for calls between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. will fall below the
psychological threshold of one DM to 0.99 DM, from the current 1.29 DM,
the group's statement said. Service on the D1 network costs 1,14 DM per
minute between these times. Mannesmann is also more flexible concerning
eligibility for the new low rates than Deutsche Telekom, which required
the subscriber to have been signed up for at least a year.

"Mannesmann Mobilfunk will propose the lower rates to its customers after
they have subscribed for three months", said the statement. There will be
a lump sum charge of 99 or 199 DM. Customers using D2 for more than two
years may switch at no cost. Mannesmann Mobilfunk is controlled by the
Mannesmann industrial group (65,2%) and AirTouch of the United States.
With more than 2.2 million subscribers in October, D2 leads the German
market, ahead of D1 (with two million customers). Germany has two other
mobile telephone networks, C Tel from Deutsche Telekom, a pioneering
network now losing momentum due to outdated analogue technology and E
Plus, which is growing slowly because it does not yet serve all of
Germany. A fourth network is scheduled to begin operating in May 1997. The
VIAG group (active in energy and packaging), which wants to diversify into
telecommunications, and British Telecom have both applied to operate this
network. The German Government will announce its choice in early February
1997.

LAST LAP FOR DEUTSCHE TELEKOM PRIVATISATION SCHEME

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The biggest privatisation drive in Germany's history entered its final
phase, on October 4, with the notification that 20% of the shares in the
telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom were on offer to the public.
Anxious to make a success of its stock exchange flotation, the group is
planning to pay out DM 1.5 billion in dividends in 1996 and 3 billion in
1997. Although they will be on sale in November, the shares will be
entitled to a payment in full for the year 1996. "This is the first time a
company entering the stock exchange has forecast the dividend for two
financial years, according to Joachim Kroeske, the group's Financial
Manager.

Deutsche Telekom is planning to place on the stock market up to 500
million new shares with a nominal value of DM 5. In the event of
oversubscription, there would also be an option for 75 million shares at
DM 5 each. A further 30 million shares have been earmarked for employees.
The share dividend should therefore amount to roughly DM 0.60 in 1996 and
1.20 in 1997. The price bracket was to be announced on October 22. The
bookbuilding system of sales involves a kind of auction with a fixed range
so as to favour the best offers. Deutsche Telekom is hoping to raise
roughly DM 15 billion with this partial privatisation, which leads
financial analysts to predict a price of between DM 25 and 30 per share.

The publicly offered shares subscription programme, one of the world's
biggest ever, is set to end on November 14. The price will be set on
November 16 in the light of the demands. On the morrow, Deutsche Telekom
shares will be quoted on stock exchanges in Germany as well as on Wall
Street and the New York Stock Exchange. A quotation is also on the cards
in Tokyo, London, Toronto and Quebec. In spite of its important
partnership with France Telecom, the German giant has not sought a
quotation on Paris exchange.

As well as attracting foreign investors, Deutsche Telekom is also keen on
appealing to small savers in Germany. This will be a new departure in
Germany, where there no more than 4.5 million shareholders in a country
with 81 million inhabitants. In order to attract German investors, the
group has persuaded the banks to ensure concessional commissions for small
savers. A loyalty bonus is being offered in the form of one free share for
every 10 held by small shareholders who keep their securities for three
years. All the major Germany banks are involved in the investment
consortium After the publicly offered shares subscription, the State will
still own roughly 80% of the capital base, which it plans to sell of in
stages between now and 1999.

BIGGER BT INPUT IN ALLIANCE WITH VIAG

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

In its bid to make a breakthrough in the telecommunications sector, VIAG,
the German energy and packaging group, is going to be able to count on a
stronger commitment from its UK partner, British Telecom (BT). In an
interview on October 15 with the Germany stock exchange daily, the
Boersen-Zeitung, the Chairman of the VIAG Management Board, Georg
Obermeier, said that under the terms of the two-sided plan, BT is going to
commit itself more to the operating side of the exercise. BT is set to
play a pivotal role with its technological expertise in telephone
switchboards. This specialist knowledge is going to be the cornerstone of
VIAG's plan for the German telecommunications market, which is to be fully
deregulated early in 1998. VIAG is banking on of parts of the terrestrial
network being linked with mobile telephone frequencies so as to allow, for
example, just one telephone number to be used.

VIAG has no experience at all of this sector so will be mainly in charge
of the marketing aspects of the plan. This is a new departure for our
group, as it has so far kept out of consumer goods activities. Marketing
will play a key role in this context, stressed Mr Obermeier. Last week the
latter has to resign himself to seeing the planned alliance with BT and
the Essen energy group, RWE, come to nought. According to the German
newspaper, the VIAG official kept on hoping right to the very last minute
that RWE would stick with the cooperation plan, in spite of running into a
rough patch in the talks opened last February on the basis of a letter of
intention. Because of RWE, certain options have not been taken up,
lamented Mr Obermeier. He claims that VIAG and BT would be taking step
between now and the New Year to determine the exact form their cooperation
would take so as to complement the activities of their joint offshoot in
Germany, VIAG Interkom. A key component of the BT/VIAG strategy is
obtaining a licence to run the fourth digital mobile telephone network in
Germany. Mr Obermeier is convinced the Government will pick the BT/VIAG
consortium in early 1997.

Mr Obermeier was one of those who predicted that the mobile telephone
industry bid fair to take off in a big way, but he admits the golden age
is over. We will need more than trading figures to earn money, he told the
newspaper. He thinks that the three digital networks already in place are
likely to run into capacity problems, though, thus leaving plenty of space
for his network.

ALCATEL/ALSTHOM: FF400 MILLION SHORTFALL

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Alcatel/Alsthom logged a net loss of FF 400 million in the first half of
1996. This compares with 1.2 billion in the same period last year,
according to Serge Tchuruk the group's Chairman. Apparently, these results
are perfectly in tune with the market programme, reflecting recent trends
and the still limited effects of the recovery plan embarked upon. The
improvement in the group's situation is attributed in the main to a
reduction in taxes and the better results achieved by companies under the
equity method. The group claims the recovery programme's even bigger
impact in the second half of the year points to a return to a balanced
situation for the whole of 1996. The group's turnover stands at FF 74.3
billion, down 3.4% on first half of 1995. Orders are nonetheless on the
wax in all sectors, reaching FF 81.5 billion in the first six months with
particularly strong growth in the telecommunications division.
Alcatel/Alsthom says half of the FF 10 billion assets transfer programme
has been achieved and the programme is due to be finalised in the coming
months, thus helping to make a substantial cut in the debt ratio. The aim
of achieving 7 billion worth of savings across the board by 1998 is still
in view. More than 20,0000 job cuts have been made or announced since the
middle of last year.

MINOR REVOLUTION IN FRENCH TELEPHONE INDUSTRY

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The French telephone system has undergone a minor revolution: the
10-figure numbering system became a reality on October 18, 11 pm local
time, pending the major revolution, early in 1998, when the national
network is due to be opened up to competition from private operators. The
change affects the 32.5 million telephone subscribers who have been using
eight-figure numbers since 1985. The new system has been introduced to
enable the national network to cope with the veritable explosion in
services (fax, stationary and mobile telephones, for example) for which a
million new numbers will have to be created each year. The eight-figure
system allows for 60 million different combinations but the 10-figure
numbers have the potential to create 470 million, and thus cater for the
anticipated needs between now and the year 2050. In the countdown to
Euro-wide deregulation in 1998, France Telecom is joining forces with
American Sprint and Deutsche Telekom of Germany to create Global One, an
entity offering telephone services to businesses. It is hoped Global One
will help FT fend off some of the competition from other
telecommunications giants when national barriers come tumbling down in
Europe. The main rivals are expected to be the UK's BT, which has signed
an agreement with the French group Cegetel, whilst the Bouyges group, a
newcomer on the telephone scene, has formed a partnership with STET of
Italy.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: PROGRESS ON CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The member countries of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development) have recently made progress towards the establishment of
international guidelines for policy on cryptography, i.e., the encoding of
computerised data. Drafting of the text is expected to be completed by the
end of the year. These guideliens could then be adopted by governments and
applied by enterprises, private citizens and law enforcement authorities
to ensure protection of transactions, communications and electronic
information storage.

The OECD guidelines define issues that countries must address when
developing cryptography policy at national and international level. Tehy
could play an important role in the development of the global information
infrastructure (GII) and the global information society (GIS). National
policies must be harmonised at international level to meet the needs of
global technologies and applications. Discussions have focused on users'
rights to choose methods of encryption, the freedom of the market to
develop these methods, interoperability, the consequences for protection
of privacy and personal information, freedom of access to encoded
information and the reduction of obstacles to international trade.

Non binding recommendations

The OECD guidelines will take the form of non binding recommendations to
the government of its member countries. In other words, they will not be
incorporated into international law and will not endorse any particular
encryption system. At a recent meeting, more than 100 representatives of
OECD member countries participated in debates chaired by Norman Reaburn of
the Australian Department of Justice. Officials from Ministries of Trade,
Industry and Foreign Affairs, Commissioners responsible for data
protection and other officials involved with safeguarding privacy attended
the meeting, along with representatives of law enforcement and public
safety bodies. Representatives of the private sector from many countries
were also present. The BIAC (the OECD's Business and Industry Advisory
Committee) was involved with the entire process of drafting the guidelines
and experts on protection of privacy and personal data, as well as
consumers, were also asked to contribute to the discussions.

Work on the guidelines began in March, when the OECD set up an ad hoc
group of experts composed of representatives of governments and OECD
country experts. This group met in Washington in May and again in Paris in
June. Its third meeting took place on September 26 and 27 in Paris. The
group will continue its negotiations during the week of December 16, with
the goal of completing, by the end of the year, draft guidelines to be
submitted to the OECD Council for its approval in early 1997.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: FORUM ON FUTURE OF MOBILE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The functioning of pocket satellite telephones into the 21st century was
the central topic of a Forum held in Geneva between October 21 and 23, and
attended by a thousand delegates from 126 countries and 250 company
representatives. Staged by the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU), the Forum on "Global mobile personal communications by satellite"
(GMPCS), was intended to goad both governments and industry to draw up
unique and globally compatible standards for this new telecommunications
technology.

This new technology extends not only to telephones but also to computers,
faxes and all mobile terminals used to communicate. It will be mainly
based on rings of satellites in low and medium orbit. Such satellites
appear to move in relation to the earth, unlike geo-stationary satellites
in high orbit which, seen from the ground, appear motionless.

Opening the Forum, ITU Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne, author of a
report used as a basis for the discussions, emphasised the "historic"
nature of the gathering. His report highlighted the Forum's "primary task"
in "defining a set of non-binding principles" which will necessarily be a
compromise. These principles will, according to Mr Tarjanne, need to
respect the "sovereign right of States to regulate telecommunications in
the framework of national policies". However, they will also need to take
account of "demands form systems operators and suppliers of GMPCS services
for open, fair and competitive access to national markets, through
transparent and non-discriminatory regulations".

Meanwhile, fourteen companies representing the industries involved in the
sector, have submitted a joint document to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), declaring their support for "a comprehensive global agreement on
access to the satellite services market". These operators claim that a
single geo-stationary satellite costing several hundreds of millions of
dollars can replace five billion dollars-worth of terrestrial
infrastructure (cable, fibre optics etc.). While it would take more than a
century to extend terrestrial infrastructures across the entire globe,
they claim that satellites offer a cheap and rapid means of extending
telecommunications to isolated and poor regions.

Given that each individual nation will have to approve the proposed
services, satellite operators insist "the multilateral approach of the WTO
is the best alternative". They add that it is vital to "harmonise national
frequency allocations with those of other countries". For satellites to be
used worldwide, they must be accessible on the same range of frequencies
in all the countries they serve". The joint document was signed by Comsat,
Final Analysis, Globalstar, Hughes, ICO Global, Inmarsat, Iridium,
Lockheed Martin, MCHI, Motorola, Orion, PanAmSat, Teledesic and TRW.

ITU DEBATE ON "CALL BACK" SERVICES

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva, has urged its
members to deliberate among themselves on one of the most controversial
issues currently facing telecommunications: "call-back" services. These
services send international calls via private operators abroad, most
commonly in the United States where prices are among the cheapest in the
world. Anxious that such services shouldn't be sold to countries where
they are banned, the ITU Council insisted on October 11 that "countries
must respect each another's national statutes". The ITU will re-examine
requests for a total ban on such practices in 1997.

The system substantially reduces the cost of calls for subscribers, but
purloins revenue from national telephone companies. "Call back" services
are expanding rapidly and currently represent a turnover of 500 million
dollars a year. The ITU believes this figure will top USD1.2 billion by
1998. Some 25 countries have thus far banned such services, according to
the ITU. In these countries, telephone companies, which are for the most
part monopolies, believe their interests are being harmed by this
opportunistic activity which continues oblivious to the cost burden of
maintaining the public telephone network. In the United States, where
tariffs are particularly low, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
authorises call-back services, although American operators are prohibited
from offering them in countries where regulations don't mirror the US
model.

Japanese companies specialising in international telecommunications
recently called for call-back services to be banned on the grounds of
unfair competition.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: MANOEUVRING IN EUROPE AS JANUARY 1 1998 DEADLINE
APPROACHES

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

European countries are preparing for the opening to competition of the EU
telecommunications market from January 1 1998, by gradually privatising
public operators, striking international alliances and deregulating mobile
telephony markets. Several countries have secured or requested extensions
to the deadline set down in Community Directives (notably Portugal and
Ireland), while others (Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have
already installed almost entirely deregulated markets.

In Germany, Deutsche Telekom is to float 20% of company capital on the
stock market in mid-November, with the remainder sold-off in stages up to
1999. The deregulation of the German market, the largest in Europe, has
sharpened the appetite of the country's leading industrial groups: RWE
(energy) and Veba (energy) have joined forces with the British company
Cable and Wireless, while Viag (energy, packaging) has struck an alliance
with British Telecom (BT). Mannesmann has secured access to the German
railways' terrestrial telecommunications network. Digital mobile telephony
is being fought over by Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann MobilFunk, with a
third licence due to granted at the beginning of 1997: Viag and BT have
submitted a joint application.

In France, the autumn has proven fertile, with two new telecommunications
poles launched: the first, Cegetel, has been constituted by the Generale
des Eaux -allied with British Telecom, Mannesmann and the American company
SBC-, the second unites the Bouygues group with the Italian operator STET.
Bouygues and the Generale des Eaux already have a stake in the
telecommunications sector through their mobile networks which compete with
France Telecom. The public operator is to start down the road to
privatisation in the spring, with the sale of a first 20% share of company
capital.

The United Kingdom is among the group of trail blazing countries. BT was
privatised in 1984, and the traditional fixed telephony market has been
gradually deregulated since 1989. The two leading operators are BT and
Mercury (Cable and Wireless), although BT remains dominant with 80% of the
market, compared with 10% for its challenger. BT recently lowered prices
by 25%, complying with the recommendations of the industry regulator
OFTEL, which continues to frame prices.

In Belgium, the public operator Belgacom was partially privatised in
December, with an international consortium led by the Americans Ameritech,
(along with Singapore Telecom and Tele Denmark) acquiring a 49.9% stake in
the company. Belgacom is not at present quoted on the stock market, but
this eventuality hasn't been ruled out. While Belgacom retains its
monopoly over fixed telephony, the mobile market was opened to competition
in this summer: Belgacom Mobile now has a competitor in Mobistar, launched
by France Telecom and the Belgian company Telinfo.

In the Netherlands, telecommunications have been privatised for a year in
the form of KPN, a holding in which the State has a 48% stake, the
remainder being traded on the stock market. The competing private
operators are mainly American owned. Consumers have a free choice of
operator, but KPN currently remains the most competitive on local calls
and communications with neighbouring countries.

In Spain, Telefonica remains a semi-public group (20% in State hands, the
remainder in public hands), with a hard core of shareholders made up of
banks and savings banks. The conservative Government has scheduled total
privatisation for 1997. Telefonica retains a monopoly on the fixed network
but has lost its dominance over mobile communications with the arrival of
the Airtel consortium, a partnership of the Americans Air Touch, Spanish
savings banks and banks, and BT with 5%. Telefonica hasn't struck any
alliances with other European groups and is focusing development
activities on Latin America.

In Portugal, the State share in Portugal Telecom has been reduced to 51%,
following two stages of privatisation. A date for the third and final
phase, covering the introduction of a strategic partner, has still to be
fixed. Telefonica in known to have expressed in its neighbour, while
France Telecom is "following the dossier".

CALL FOR PROPOSALS IN CONTEXT OF INFO 2000 PROGRAMME

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The European Commission has renewed its call for proposals for the
implementation of one of the lines of action of the Community "INFO 2000"
programme: it concerns the transfer of intellectual property rights in the
multimedia sector (line 3.2). A multi-annual programme, INFO 2000 is
intended to promote the development of a European multimedia content
industry. One aspect covered by this programme is the negotiation of
intellectual property rights. The administration of these rights is
traditionally organised by sector (text, sound, images, video, etc.). The
time and effort employed in the identification and acquisition of rights
is rising sharply as the number of forms of data, and of countries in
which right-holders reside increase. In this context, and on the eve of
the multimedia era, efficient and cost-effective mechanisms for
negotiating multimedia rights have become indispensable.

The call for proposals covers the selection of experts who will provide
technical support in this field to the European Commission services in
Luxembourg. The deadline for submissions is December 2 1996.

Further details on this call can be obtained before November 20 from DG
XIII-E-1, fax (352)43 013 79. Contact: J.Hoorens, DG XIII-E-2, tel.
(352)43 013 25 60, fax (352)43 013 31 90.
