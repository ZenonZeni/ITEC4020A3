<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN R. MATCHETT, <br>
</h1>

<p><b>TREASURY DEPARTMENT. <br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. MATCHETT: The problem is clarified a little bit by
recognizing that there are two distinct phases involved, the
first of which must be pretty well finished before the second can
begin. <br>
First of all, there is the separation of the active principle
from other material, and second, the characterization of it.
Before a competent separation can be undertaken, we must be in
possession of suitable assay methods. <br>
We, of course, are interested in those manifestations of
Marihuana that lead to the effects, which have led in turn, to
the passage of the Act We are not sure, I take it, whether the
substance produces ataxia in the dog, or sleep in the mouse, or
corneal(?) anesthesia in the rabbit is the <br>
same as the one in which we are interested.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, something must be adopted, and by common consent, a
dog assay, with all its faults, has been the method of choice. It
seems obvious that these various principles, if more than one
exists, will be each characterized on its own merits.<br>
In considering this phase of it, also, it must not be forgotten
that any one of the effects may be combinations, and any of the
effects that we are able to measure may possibly be combined
effects, of which the bad effect of the drug itself may be only
one. <br>
With that so disposed of, it is possible to recognize that
certain characteristics of the so-called resin are fairly well
defined already, although I think we must recognize that the
resin itself is variable, and to what extent, we are not yet able
to say very definitely. As Dr. Blatt said, there have been
certain individuals isolated in pure form, of which the most
important are Cannabinol and the hydrocarbon nonacosame.<br>
There is also present definitely in the resin a substance that
responds to the alkaline Beam test.<br>
There are still other substances among all those responsible for
the psychological and physiological activity; of such there may
be one or more. <br>
<br>
And finally, there are those volatile oils, in which there is no
tremendous interest other than to dispose of them before being
able to isolate the drug.<br>
Now, little or nothing is known of the nature of the active
substance. All attacks on the problem have, thus far, broadly
speaking, produced negative results. The thing, in any event, is
not an alkaloid, because we are not able to extract it into acid
solutions from solvents, nor does it contain any nitrogen. It is
not an acid, since it does not extract into alkaline solution.
And it has not been shown to contain any carbonyl groups because
it does not form any derivatives with the common reagents for
such.<br>
</p>

<p>There is evidence on the other hand that it forms esters and
that it is an aromatic substance, the latter from the refractive
index of the most active fraction. From that it would appear to
be a phenolic compound. The substance is thermostable under
rather rigorous conditions, but it is <br>
quickly destroyed in the presence of oxygen. It is also quite
likely that it is unsaturated since reduction by hydrogen is
possible. <br>
But all those, unfortunately, are properties of the active
mixtures that Dr. Blatt referred to, rather than of any chemical
individual. They are all of some assistance though, in
considering methods by which the problem may be attacked.<br>
Now, only distillation in a rather high vacuum has been of any
assistance thus far in fractionating the mixture, known as
Cannabis resin. The volatile oils are so separated with relative
ease. The substance responsible for the acid Beam test, whatever
it may be, is removed, the acid test no longer appearing in the
distillate. The hydrocarbon which does appear in the distillate
can be removed by crystallization from alcohol or some other
solvent, and pure Cannabinol can <br>
be removed as a crystalline acetate or paranitry benzoate. As Dr.
Blatt pointed out, this point is where the trail ends at present,
with the exception of a brief note indicating that it is
definitely possible to find physiological effects in the material
remaining after Cannabinol has been removed.<br>
It is at that point that we purpose ultimately to actually begin.
The former distillation has been carried out at pressures
anywhere from atmospheric down to a reported pressure of about
five-one thousandths of a millimeter.<br>
From the character of the work in which this was reported it
would appear that the reported pressures must be taken with a
grain of salt. No essential difference however has appeared <br>
in the products of fractionation. The material, as you may be
aware, is an exceedingly difficult material to work with, a heavy
tar-like oil, and it does not lend itself readily to distillation
by any means. We have considered that at this point it might be
preferable to resort to molecular distillation in an effort to
obtain a more competent separation. If this hope be realized, a
number of avenues of attack are opened or re-opened. That is,
among other things the action of solvents may be reinvestigated,
and of particular interest will be the action of solvents at low
temperatures. Then there are possibilities of preferential
adsorption, and also it may be possible to prepare crystalline
derivatives. They fail to appear from treatment of the present
mixtures.<br>
Now, the molecular distillation outfit that we have chosen for
this work is of the static type, rather than the cyclic still
with which you are probably more familiar, because the higher
boiling fractions of this material are so viscous that they
probably would not cycle with in that <br>
still without special precautions to maintain a high temperature.
<br>
</p>

<p>The original material has been distilled before passing it
into the molecular still in a flash apparatus that operates under
a good vacuum. This is necessary since the crude oil is
particularly prone to spit in the molecular still and ruin the
distillation. More specifically, the process that we are
following is extraction from the plant material with cold
alcohol, alcohol being chosen as a solvent rather than petroleum
ether, on account of fire hazard. This process is <br>
followed by a liquid extraction from the alcohol by pentane,
which does away with a lot of water soluble material, and tarry
material of a nondescript character.<br>
We have not yet thoroughly satisfied ourselves that all of the
active material is extracted by pentane, but we believe we have
every reason to think it is.<br>
Then the pentane, which incidentally, extracts quite a little
alcohol, is removed, and the alcohol is also removed. The
material is then passed through the flash process that I referred
to a moment ago, and the distillate from here is placed in the
molecular still. That is the point which the investigation has
reached at this particular moment.<br>
</p>

<p>Now, it is expected to divide the oil into about ten fractions
in the stills, then to remove Cannabinol as the acetate and the
hydrocarbon by precipitation from a suitable solvent, and then to
refractions, to the remaining material. The work from that point,
of course, all depend upon the results of the fractionations, and
can not be very definitely foreseen, other than that <br>
those processes, to which I referred a moment ago, will be
applied. Now, it would have been possible to have attacked
certain phases of the problem along a number of other lines, a
few of which I will suggest in conclusion. The first would be a
characterization of those volatile oils, <br>
which have been referred to, and which would be of interest from
a purely chemical point of view. They are separated with relative
ease, by steam distillation, for example. No one, of course, has
been very much interested in them, and that line of attack has
not been followed.<br>
Again, someone might become interested in the substance which
responds to the acid Beam test. It can be removed from a solution
in petroleum either by means of alkali, and presumably would be
isolated with relatively little difficulty, but experience shows
that resins so prepared <br>
are not physiologically active, hence little interest is attached
to that substance.<br>
</p>

<p>A third possible line of attack would have been in connection
with the Beam test itself. The development of the color is due to
a product resulting from oxidation of some substance which is
present In the resin. This substance is soluble in aqueous
alkali, and is precipitated by acid. It can be readily extracted
from acid solution. It, of course, is not actually the substance
which responds to the alkaline Beam test, but it would be of
great interest from the purely scientific point of view.<br>
</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: I would like to make a couple of announcements.
Those of you who are not particularly interested in the chemical
attack here may find this part of the program a little arduous,
and I want you to understand that you are at liberty to leave and
interrupt if you want <br>
to, as I think this part of the program might be a little obtuse
at certain points.<br>
Dr. Blatt has just indicated that there are some errors in the
material which he distributed on the critical review. Do you want
to indicate those?<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: There is one error in the literature, for example on
page 469 in the middle of the page are three formulas, just one
the paragraph beginning in the middle of those formulas. <br>
There is a carbon atom, a &quot;C&quot;, a single line to an
oxygen &quot;0&quot;, and that should be a double line to make it
conform to the other two. Then, on that flow sheet, on the
left-hand half of the page, the second of those errors reads
&quot;dihydrogenation with sulphur,&quot; and that should be
&quot;dehydrogenation&quot;, and not &quot;dihydrogenation&quot;.
<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: As you gathered, Dr. Matchett's attack there is
directed at the heart of the problem; that is to say, the
isolation and characterization of the extreme number of active
principles. I indicated at the beginning that there is another
phase of the problem, and that was identification. We at this
time do not know whether the chemical attack is destined to
determine the active principle in one year or sixty years.<br>
</p>

<p>The Treasury has issued a little manual of identification,
consisting largely of photographs, and it is being distributed.
In this country we are mostly dealing with the drug in its plant
form, and in this manual they are showing the separate parts of
plants, and so on, and it is helpful in that <br>
direction. I am going to ask Mr. Levine to give us a picture of
the Beam test.<br>
<br>
