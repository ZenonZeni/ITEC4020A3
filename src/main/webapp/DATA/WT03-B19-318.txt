<P>
The CRC for Water Quality and Treatment was established in 1995, bringing together the main players in the Australian R&D sector which have a specific focus on drinking water supply. The CRC is concerned with the water cycle which commences at the catchment reservoir and finishes at the consumer's tap, ie. the cost-effective provision of safe drinking water.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
For the first time, experts on epidemiology, risk estimation, reservoir and catchment processes, water-treatment techniques, chemical and biological processes in distribution systems and water-quality monitoring have been brought together in an integrated effort to look closely at the optimum approach to the provision of drinking water.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The individual partners in the CRC have a long history of research successes, ranging from the development of new water-treatment and monitoring systems to the dissemination of new knowledge about environmental factors impinging on water quality. They have always be en closely integrated with the Australian water industry and the formation of the CRC reinforces this close industry collaboration.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The water industry in Australia involves capital assets with a total value around $60 billion. About one-third of this figure is tied up by the provision of drinking water. The new Australian Drinking Water Guidelines will add significant pressure to water authorities to maximise the efficiency of their service provision.
There is significant and expanding scope to export the goods and services developed for the Australian water industry, particularly to the rapidly growing and urbanising regions of South-East Asia. Europe and the US also provide export opportunities.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Of the 17 partners involved in the CRC, eight are from Victoria, the largest number from any State. The Victorian partners have significant strengths across the water sector and include a major research group (CSIRO), two universities (Monash and RMIT), a water authority, as well as a consultant, contractor and a chemical supplier. All elements of the industry are well represented in the Victorian partners, thus providing a great opportunity for commercial development and exploitation.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
A significant education and training program involves co-operation between universities in Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra. This program aims to develop major educational activities ranging from postgraduate research, through honours and undergraduate coursework to international student exchange and public education. It aims to establish a strong interface with the Water Industry Education Training Authority of Australia (WIETA) and establish a specialty Master's Program in Water Quality and Treatment, with Graduate Diploma and Graduate Certificate Options in distance-education mode.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
There are many opportunities for the provision of goods and services to the water supply industry, ranging from the provision of complete design-construct-and-operate contracts to the supply of particular pieces of equipment and/or services.
While the industry partners in the CRC will have first access to any research outcomes, there will be ample opportunity for small to medium-sized enterprises to develop specialised business opportunities around particular products or services. Leveraged support to develop export opportunities is available through a number of Australian Government programs.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The CRC has Australian Government funding support for a period of seven years. After the first year of operation the proposed budget for the CRC will be around $7 million per annum, comprising about $4.8 million from research and industry partners and $2.2 million from the Australian Government.
