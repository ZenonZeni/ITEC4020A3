<p><h1>ANNOUNCEMENT: 10/15/96</h1>

<p>
As you should know by now, I have sent instructions to those of you
for whom I have e-mail addresses on how to use MSDOS debug to load in
the machine code for my TWI.COM encryption/decryption program.

<p>
If you have not yet sent me your e-mail address, please do so immediately.
If for any other reason you have not received the instructions, please
let me know either by e-mail or in class.

<p>
My e-mail address for matters relating to this course is:<br><br>

     junger@samsara.law.cwru.edu
<p><hr>
<p>
I have to use this round-about way of getting the instructions to you because I
do not have permission under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
from the Office of Defense Trade Controls in the United States Department 
of State to post them on this web-server or otherwise publish them.

<p>I hope to have a hard copy set of instructions shortly.  When I get that
printed up, I will hand it out in class.  Ultimately these instructions
will be incorporated in the casebook.

<p>
I will mail you instructions on how to use the TWI.COM programs shortly.  
Those instructions also require a license from the Office of Defense Trade
Controls before they can be published.

<p>
I am pleased to be able to report that one of your number has reported to
me that he (in the unisex meaning of that pronoun) has successfully loaded
in the TWI program and been able to use it to encrypt (and decrypt) a 
message to launch missles.

<p>
Peter Junger
