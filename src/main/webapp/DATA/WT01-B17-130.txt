<font size="-1"><b>America's Medical Gulag | Medical Terrorism American-Style | Get Indignant -- You Can Change Medicine</b></font><p>

<br><br>


<h4>AMERICA’S MEDICAL GULAG</h4>
<b>Attacking Doctors</b><p>
   
	During the Communist era, political dissidents were routinely arrested, subjected to mock trials,  imprisoned, and often murdered in the remote Gulag Archipelago of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the FDA, conventional medicine trade groups, state medical boards, and the big drug companies, America has its own “Gulag” for doctors who deviate from the enforced norms and who practice alternative medicine. What the Soviet Union accomplished through state-imposed tyranny, American medicine accomplishes through licensing, regulations, and the FDA: the suppression of your freedom of choice in medical care.<p>
	Our American Gulag ruins alternative doctors through suppression, harassment, indictments, licensure revocation, and bankruptcy. To be a hero in this climate of medical nonfreedom and political intimidation, you need a lot of money, fortitude, and courage. A few physicians, such as Dr. Jonathan Wright, Dr. Warren Levin, and Dr. Lawrence Taylor, have survived the allopathic Gulag,  but many more are now under its repressive thumbs. They urgently need the immediate moral and financial support of patients and concerned citizens.<p>
	DAVID STEENBLOCK, M.D. This California doctor was forced into bankruptcy in September 1995 when state medical authorities confiscated 6 FDA-approved hyperbaric oxygen machines, worth $600,000, which he uses to treat patients who have had strokes and heart attacks. No patient complaints were registered, but 30 very ill patients were forced to wait 2 months for treatment and one patient died the day after being grilled by state medical authorities in Dr. Steenblock’s office. The embargo was lifted in November and the clinic struggles on.<p>
	JOHN E. GAMBEE, M.D. For 16 years, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners has sought, through 25 investigations, to revoke Dr. Gambee’s medical license. They have ruined his practice and have literally bankrupted him. Yet there have been no patient complaints or malpractice claims against him. Dr. Gambee, who advocates vitamins and minerals as adjuncts in his treatments, was instrumental in the drafting and passage of Oregon HB 3340, which guarantees access to alternative treatments as of November 1995. Unfortunately, nothing has been done to reform the medical licensing board which specializes in a “slick combination of terrorism and phony public relations campaigns,” states Dr. Gambee.<p>
	STANISLAW BURZYNSKI, M.D. This Texas physician specializes in cancer and AIDS treatment using antineoplaston therapy which he developed. Dr. Burzynski, who has been the target of a 12-year campaign by the FDA to run him out of business, including 4 unsuccessful attempts to indict him, was served a new 75-count indictment by a Houston grand jury in November 1995 for allegedly shipping an unapproved drug across state lines and  falsifying insurance claims with respect to the legality of the drug. There were no patient complaints registered; in fact, patients stepped forward to testify that Dr. Burzynski’s approach had saved lives. Prior to the indictment, a Congressional committee began  investigations into the FDA persecution of Dr. Burzynski. If convicted, he faces up to 8 years in prison and $1.9 million in fines and the lives of up to 300 patients are directly at stake. “Every week I see people responding to treatment,” states Dr. Burzynski. If doctors such as he are stopped, “You will see documented human genocide in America.<p>
	 HAL A. HUGGINS, D.D.S. Colorado dentist Hal Huggins has already spent $250,000 in legal fees fending off attacks by the Colorado State Medical Board and Attorney General’s office over the last 3 years. In August 1995, Dr. Huggins closed his dental practice to devote himself full time to educating the public about the dangers of mercury toxicity and the advisability of removing mercury-based dental amalgams. <p>
	Seeking to revoke his license, medical authorities concocted at least 8 bogus patient claims against Dr. Huggins, based on his advocacy of removing mercury fillings and his use of unconventional therapies. “What they are saying is a dentist has a legal right to place mercury, one of the world’s heaviest toxins, in someone’s mouth and then assume no legal responsibility for the results,” states Dr. Huggins. According to Dr. Huggins, 13 other dentists around the U.S. were similarly “hit” by medical authorities within a 10-day period of his most recent harassment.<p>

<h4>MEDICAL TERRORISM  AMERICAN-STYLE</h4>
<b>How to Vote It Out of Office</b><p>

	Americans do not enjoy freedom of medical choice nor are physicians allowed to practice unconventional but effective therapies without being subjected to harassment. However, 3 bills are before the U.S. Congress that, if passed, will radically transform the American medical scene in favor of alternative medicine, freedom of choice, and open marketplace competition. Their passage absolutely requires the grassroots support and politicking of millions of concerned Americans. <p>
	ACCESS TO MEDICAL TREATMENT ACT (HR 2019, S. 1035). This bill will allow an individual to be treated by any licensed or legally authorized health care practitioner with any method of treatment desired (including non FDA-approved ones) provided the treatment does no serious harm and the patient is fully informed, in writing by the doctor, about anticipated benefits, results of past treatments, and possible side effects. The bill will remove federal government interference in the patient-physician relationship.<p>
	PHARMACY COMPOUNDING PRESERVATION ACT (HR 598). This bill will guarantee the ability of licensed pharmacists to make (compound) medicines and their right to obtain bulk drug products under applicable state and federal laws. This means a physician will continue to be able to prescribe any medical substance, even if it’s not made by a pharmaceutical company and is only available through a compounding pharmacist. Currently, the FDA seeks to make it illegal for pharmacists to compound medicines for doctors’ prescriptions, which could make it impossible to obtain DHEA and certain progesterone and natural estrogen formulas.<p>
	FOOD AND DIETARY CONSUMER INFORMATION ACT (HR 1951). This bill will allow food and dietary supplement companies to make truthful and nonmisleading statements about their product, a practice the FDA currently obstructs. Even better, it will prevent the FDA from classifying foods and dietary supplements (such as vitamins and herbs) as drugs, which effectively outlaws their use except when prescribed by physicians. 	<p>
	PATIENT RIGHTS REGULATORY REFORM ACT OF 1995. This bill (S.1477), introduced December 13, 1995, could be bad news and should be opposed. It could undermine all the gains of the Access to Medical Treatment Act described above. While it is meant as an FDA-reform measure, one part (Title 2) of the bill would give the FDA the authority to determine what forms of unapproved health care are best and therefore legal, and it would allow the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices only if the company first files a complicated FDA testing protocols application, thereby subjecting them to intense federal scrutiny, delay, and cost. The bill would regulate dietary supplements as drugs and restrict patient access to new, effective, but unapproved therapies.<p>

<h4>GET INDIGNANT! </h4>
<b>You Can Change Medicine</b><p>

	In 1989, when Warren Levin, M.D., came to New York attorney Robert H. Harris seeking legal defense against state medical authorities who had filed a 570-count complaint, Harris was the 32nd lawyer Levin had approached. Levin was (and remains) one of New York State’s leading holistic physicians, but Harris was the first lawyer willing to take on his case. 	<p>
	After 60 days of hearings, all charges against Dr. Levin were dismissed; none related to harm against a patient. “This was not a professional disciplinary trial but a political one,” stated Harris at the 2nd International Congress of Electro-Dermal Screening Health Practitioners in Salt Lake City, Utah, in November 1995. “The U.S. thinks of itself as a place where smart things happen, but we couldn’t be more wrong in the world of medicine.”<p>
	Since Levin’s hearing, the New York State legislature has revamped its laws, permitting patients greater access to unconventional medical treatment and guaranteeing doctors a less restrictive climate for practice. But there is still far more reform that needs to happen.<p>
	Harris now specializes in defending alternative medicine physicians against state, FDA, and medical board harassment. Skillful, emboldened lawyers are now as vital to the cause of alternative medicine as courageous doctors, and Harris is setting a fine example. According to him, “If you develop a sense of healthy indignation and outrage that your freedoms are being taken away, and commit yourself to being outspoken, you do make a difference.”  <p>
	There are other “Warren Levins” who are losing their licenses right now, Harris reported. The only way to stop this is to vote, write letters, and speak out. Congress received more mail in 1994 regarding vitamin labeling than for any subject, other than abortion, in its recorded history. This volume of letters persuaded Congress to protect supplements from the FDA. More letters are needed now. “This is our country; these are our rights,”  Harris said. “You do not have the right to bellyache about anything if you do not bellyache about anything. If you feel impotent as a single person, your voice can inspire others, who may also feel impotent; then as a group, you become potent.”<p>
