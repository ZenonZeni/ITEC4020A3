<P>
Let's say you've already come to the
conclusion that you need professional help with your investing.
With thousands of investment organizations offering private asset
management services, the problem you're facing is how to select
the right one. There are many questions that you need to confront.
What's their past track record? Do they understand your
special needs, investment attitudes and risk tolerances?

<P>
Few investors have the time, knowledge or resources
to perform this critical selection process. Even after you choose
a manager, your portfolio needs to be closely monitored and the
performance constantly evaluated. It's vital that you know how
well your investments are compared with your
stated objectives and established industry benchmarks.

<P>
In the mid-1980s, Tucker Anthony created the
<I>Managed Account Program (MAP</I><I><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</FONT></SUP></I>) to address the needs of individual and institutional investors seeking professional help. MAP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>SM</SUP></FONT>
places the day-to-day responsibility of managing your portfolio
with a professional investment advisor. In this program, a Tucker
Anthony  Investment Executive participates as an Investment Management
Consultant, assisting in the asset allocation and management selection
process. MAP's three-step plan takes a logical and measurable
approach to investment management. The steps include:

<OL>
<LI><B>Investment Strategy Review</B>
---  without clear-cut goals, your portfolio cannot function with
any expectation of success. Your Investment Executive will help
you assess your financial objectives and formulate your personal
investment profile. The aim is to help you arrive at realistic
performance goals. This process helps you summarize your objectives
and determine ways to reach them within your stated risk parameters.
It also serves as a reference point for the continuing evaluation
of the investment manager whom you select.</LI>
<P>

<LI><B>Investment Management Selection</B>
--- Tucker Anthony begins the process of helping you select the
most appropriate manager by drawing on an extensive database of
over 1,200 investment management firms throughout the country.
We then compare your particular profile to this universe of investment
managers and select at least three firms that would be appropriate
for you. You and your Investment Executive will collaborate closely
on reviewing all the information and interviewing candidates so
that you can arrive at the manager most appropriate for you.</LI>
