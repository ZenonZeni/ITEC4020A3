<P>
<B>SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT, WORKING GROUP III</B> 
<P>
<B>1. INTRODUCTION</B> 
<P>
Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) was restructured in November 1992 and charged with conducting
&quot;technical assessments of the socioeconomics of impacts,
adaptation, and mitigation of climate change over both the short
and long term and at the regional and global levels.&quot; Working
Group III responded to this charge by further stipulating in its
work plan that it would place the socioeconomic perspectives in
the context of sustainable development and, in accordance with
the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), provide comprehensive
treatment of both mitigation and adaptation options while covering
all economic sectors and all relevant sources of greenhouse gases
and sinks.
<P>
This report assesses a large part of the existing literature on
the socioeconomics of climate change and identifies areas in which
a consensus has emerged on key issues and areas where differences
exist. The chapters have been arranged so that they cover several
key issues. First, frameworks for socioeconomic assessment of
costs and benefits of action and inaction are described. Particular
attention is given to the applicability of cost-benefit analysis,
the incorporation of equity and social considerations, and consideration
of intergenerational equity issues. Second, the economic and social
benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sinks
are reviewed. Third, the economic, social, and environmental costs
of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions are assessed. Next, generic
mitigation and adaptation response options are reviewed, methods
for assessing the costs and effectiveness of different response
options are summarized, and integrated assessment techniques are
discussed. Finally, the report provides an economic assessment
of policy instruments to combat climate change.
<P>
In accordance with the approved work plan, this assessment of
the socioeconomic literature related to climate change focuses
on economic studies; material from other social sciences is found
mostly in the chapter on equity and social considerations. The
report is an assessment of the state of knowledge - what we know
and do not know - and not a prescription for policy implementation.
Countries can use the information in this report to help take
decisions they believe are most appropriate for their specific
circumstances.
<P>
<B>2. SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENT</B> 
<P>
Climate change presents the decision maker with a set of formidable
complications: a considerable number of remaining uncertainties
(which are inherent in the complexity of the problem), the potential
for irreversible damages or costs, a very long planning horizon,
long time lags between emissions and effects, wide regional variation
in causes and effects, the irreducibly global scope of the problem,
and the need to consider multiple greenhouse gases and aerosols.
Yet another complication arises from the fact that effective protection
of the climate system requires global cooperation.
<P>
Still, a number of insights that may be useful to policymakers
can be drawn from the literature:
<P>
&#183; Analyses indicate that a prudent way to deal with climate
change is through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation,
adaptation, and improvement of knowledge. The appropriate portfolio
will differ for each country. The challenge is not to find the
best policy today for the next 100 years, but to select a prudent
strategy and to adjust it over time in the light of new information.
<P>
&#183; Earlier mitigation action may increase flexibility in moving
toward stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases (U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 2).
The choice of abatement paths involves balancing the economic
risks of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk
of delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitating
premature retirement of future capital stock).
<P>
&#183; The literature indicates that significant &quot;no-regrets&quot;
opportunities are available in most countries and that the risk
of aggregate net damage due to climate change, considerations
of risk aversion, and application of the precautionary principle
provide rationales for action beyond no regrets.
<P>
&#183; The value of better information about climate change processes
and impacts and society's responses to them is likely to be great.
In particular, the literature accords high value to information
about climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and aerosols, climate
change damage functions, and variables such as determinants of
economic growth and rates of energy efficiency improvements. Better
information about the costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation
measures and how they might change in coming decades also has
a high value.
<P>
&#183; Analysis of economic and social issues related to climate
change, especially in developing countries where little work of
this nature has been carried out, is a high priority for research.
More generally, research is needed on integrated assessment and
analysis of decision making related to climate change. Further,
research advancing the economic understanding of nonlinearities
and new theories of economic growth is also needed. Research and
development related to energy efficiency technologies and nonfossil
energy options also offer high potential value. In addition, there
is also a need for research on the development of sustainable
consumption patterns.
<P>
A portfolio of possible actions that policymakers could consider,
in accordance with applicable international agreements, to implement
low-cost and/or cost-effective measures to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change can include:
<P>
&#183; implementing energy efficiency measures, including the
removal of institutional barriers to energy efficiency improvements;
<P>
&#183; phasing out existing distortionary policies and practices
that increase greenhouse gas emissions, such as some subsidies
and regulations, non-internalization of environmental costs, and
distortions in transport pricing;
<P>
&#183; implementing cost-effective fuel switching measures from
more to less carbon-intensive fuels and to carbon-free fuels such
as renewables;
<P>
&#183; implementing measures to enhance sinks or reservoirs of
greenhouse gases, such as improving forest management and land
use practices;
<P>
&#183; implementing measures and developing new techniques for
reducing methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gas emissions;
<P>
&#183; encouraging forms of international cooperation to limit
greenhouse gas emissions, such as implementing coordinated carbon/energy
taxes, activities implemented jointly, and tradable quotas;
<P>
&#183; promoting the development and implementation of national
and international energy efficiency standards;
<P>
&#183; promoting voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
<P>
&#183; promoting education and training, implementing information
and advisory measures for sustainable development and consumption
patterns that will facilitate climate change mitigation and adaptation;
<P>
&#183; planning and implementing measures to adapt to the consequences
of climate change;
<P>
&#183; undertaking research aimed at better understanding of the
causes and impacts of climate change and facilitating more effective
adaptation to it;
<P>
&#183; conducting technological research aimed at minimizing emissions
of greenhouse gases from continued use of fossil fuels and developing
commercial nonfossil energy sources;
<P>
&#183; developing improved institutional mechanisms, such as improved
insurance arrangements, to share the risks of damages due to climate
change.
<P>
<U>Contribution of Economics</U> 
<P>
&#183; Estimates of the costs and benefits of stabilizing greenhouse
gas <I>concentrations</I> are sensitive, <I>inter alia</I>, to
the ultimate target concentration, the emission path toward this
level, the discount rate, and assumptions concerning the costs
and availability of technologies and practices.
<P>
&#183; Despite its widespread use in economic policy evaluation,
Gross Domestic Product is widely recognized to be an imperfect
measure of society's well-being, largely because it fails to account
for degradation of the environment and natural systems. Other
methodologies exist that try to take these nonmarket values and
social and ecological sustainability into account. Such methodologies
would provide a more complete indication of how climate change
might affect society's well-being.
<P>
&#183; Given the interrelated nature of the global economic system,
attempts to mitigate climate change through actions in one region
or sector may have offsetting economic effects that risk increasing
the emissions of other regions and sectors (so-called leakages).
These emission leakages can be lessened through coordinated actions
of groups of countries.
<P>
&#183; The literature suggests that flexible, cost-effective policies
relying on economic incentives and instruments, as well as coordinated
instruments, can considerably reduce mitigation or adaptation
costs or increase the cost-effectiveness of emission reduction
measures.
<P>
<U>Equity Considerations</U> 
<P>
In considering equity principles and issues related to greenhouse
gas emissions, it is important for policy consideration to take
into account in particular Articles 3, 4.2a, and 11.2 of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change, Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration,
and general principles of international law.
<P>
Scientific analyses cannot prescribe how equity should be applied
in implementing the Framework Convention on Climate Change, but
analysis can clarify the implications of alternative choices and
their ethical basis.
<P>
&#183; Developing countries require support for institutional
and endogenous capacity building, so that they may effectively
participate in climate change decision making.
<P>
&#183; It is important that both efficiency and equity concerns
be considered during the analysis of mitigation and adaptation
measures. For the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate
efficiency from equity. This analytical separation presupposes
that (and is valid, for policy purposes, only if) effective institutions
exist or can be created for appropriate redistribution of climate
change costs. It may be worthwhile to conduct analyses of the
equity implications of particular measures for achieving efficiency,
including their social considerations and impacts.
<P>
<B>3. DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORKS FOR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE</B>

<P>
Since climate change is a global issue, comprehensive analyses
of mitigation, adaptation, and research measures are needed to
identify the most efficient and appropriate strategy to address
climate change. International decision making related to climate
change, as established by the FCCC, is a collective process in
which a variety of concerns, such as equity, ecological protection,
economics, ethics, and poverty-related issues, are of special
significance for present and future generations. Treatments of
decision making under uncertainty, risk aversion, technology development
and diffusion processes, and distributional considerations are
at present relatively poorly developed in international environmental
economics, and especially in the climate change literature.
<P>
Decision making related to climate change must take into account
the <I>unique</I> characteristics of the &quot;problem&quot;:
large uncertainties (scientific and economic), possible nonlinearities
and irreversibilities, asymmetric distribution of impacts geographically
and temporally, the very long time horizon, and the global nature
of climate change with the associated potential for free riding.
Beyond scientific uncertainties (discussed in Volume 1)) and impact
uncertainties (Volume 2), <I>socioeconomic uncertainties</I> relate
to estimates of how these changes will affect human society (including
direct economic and broader welfare impacts) and to the socioeconomic
implications of emission abatement.
<P>
The other dimension that magnifies uncertainties and complicates
decision making is <I>geographical</I>: climate change is a global
problem encompassing an incredibly diverse mix of human societies,
with differing histories, circumstances, and capabilities. Many
developing countries are in relatively hot climates, depend more
heavily on agriculture, and have less well developed infrastructure
and social structures; thus, they may suffer more than average,
perhaps much more. In developed countries, there may also be large
climate change impacts.
<P>
The literature also emphasizes that delaying responses is itself
a decision involving costs. Some studies suggest that the cost
of delay is small; others emphasize that the costs could include
imposition of risks on all parties (particularly the most vulnerable),
greater utilization of limited atmospheric capacity, and potential
deferral of desirable technical development. No consensus is reflected
in the literature.
<P>
The global nature of the problem - necessitating collective action
by sovereign states - and the large differences in the circumstances
of different parties raise consequential as well as procedural
issues. Consequential issues relate to outcomes while procedural
issues relate to how decisions are made. In relation to climate
change, the existence of an agreed legal framework involves a
collective process within a negotiated framework (the FCCC). Accordingly
decision making can be considered within three different categories
of frameworks, each with different implications and with distinct
foci: global optimization (trying to find the globally optimal
result), procedural decision making (establishing and refining
rules of procedure), and collective decision making (dealing with
distributional issues and processes involving the interaction
of numerous independent decision makers).
<P>
Application of the literature on decision making to climate change
provides elements that can be used in building collective and/or
market-oriented strategies for sharing risks and realizing mutual
benefits. It suggests that actions be sequential (temporally distributed),
that countries implement a portfolio of mitigation, adaptation,
and research measures, and that they adjust this portfolio continuously
in response to new knowledge. The potential for transfers of financial
resources and technology to developing countries may be considered
as a part of any comprehensive analytical framework.
<P>
Elements of a market-related strategy concern <I>insurance and
markets for risk</I>. Pooling risk does not change the risk, but
it can improve economic efficiency and welfare. Although insurance
capable of sharing climate change risks on a global basis currently
does not exist, one of the important potential gains from cooperating
in a collective framework, such as the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, is that of risk sharing. Creating an insurance
system to cover the risks of climate change is difficult, and
the international community has not yet established such sophisticated
instruments. This, however, does not preclude future international
action to establish insurance markets sufficient for some international
needs.
<P>
<B>4. EQUITY AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</B> 
<P>
Equity considerations are an important aspect of climate change
policy and of the Convention. In common language equity means
&quot;the quality of being impartial&quot; or &quot;something
that is fair and just.&quot; The FCCC, including the references
to equity and equitable in Articles 3.1, 4.2.a, and 11.2, provides
the context for efforts to apply equity in meeting the purposes
and the objective of the Convention. International law, including
relevant decisions of the International Court of Justice, may
also provide guidance.
<P>
A variety of ethical principles, including the importance of meeting
people's basic needs, may be relevant to addressing climate change,
but the application to relations among states of principles originally
developed to guide individual behaviour is complex and not straightforward.
Climate change policies should not aggravate existing disparities
between one region and another nor attempt to redress all equity
issues.
<P>
Equity involves procedural as well as consequential issues. Procedural
issues relate to how decisions are made while consequential issues
relate to outcomes. To be effective and to promote cooperation,
agreements must be regarded as legitimate, and equity is an important
element in gaining legitimacy.
<P>
Procedural equity encompasses process and participation issues.
It requires that all parties be able to participate effectively
in international negotiations related to climate change. Appropriate
measures to enable developing country parties to participate effectively
in negotiations increase the prospects for achieving effective,
lasting, and equitable agreements on how best to address the threat
of climate change. Concern about equity and social impacts points
to the need to build endogenous capabilities and strengthen institutional
capacities, particularly in developing countries, to make and
implement collective decisions in a legitimate and equitable manner.
<P>
Consequential equity has two components: the distribution of the
costs of damages or adaptation and of measures to mitigate climate
change. Because countries differ substantially in vulnerability,
wealth, capacity, resource endowments, and other factors listed
below, the costs of the damages, adaptation, and mitigation may
be borne inequitably, unless the distribution of these costs is
addressed explicitly.
<P>
Climate change is likely to impose costs on future generations
and on regions where damages occur, including regions with low
greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change impacts will be distributed
unevenly.
<P>
The Convention recognizes in Article 3.1 the principle of common
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
Actions beyond &quot;no-regrets&quot; measures impose costs on
the present generation. Mitigation policies unavoidably raise
issues about how to share the costs. The initial emission limitation
intentions of Annex I parties represent an agreed collective first
step of those parties in addressing climate change.
<P>
Equity arguments can support a variety of proposals to distribute
mitigation costs. Most of them seem to cluster around two main
approaches: equal per capita emission allocations and allocations
based on incremental departures from national baseline emissions
(current or projected). Some proposals combine these approaches
in an effort to incorporate equity concerns not addressed by relying
exclusively on one or the other approach. The IPCC can clarify
scientifically the implications of different approaches and proposals,
but the choice of particular proposals is a policy judgment.
<P>
There are substantial variations both among developed and developing
countries that are relevant to the application of equity principles
to mitigation. These include variations in historical and cumulative
emissions, current total and per capita emissions, emission intensities
and economic output, and factors such as wealth, energy structures,
and resource endowments. The literature is weak on the equity
implications of these variations both among developed and developing
countries.
<P>
In addition, the implications of climate change for developing
countries are different from those for developed countries. The
former often have different urgent priorities, weaker institutions,
and are generally more vulnerable to climate change. However,
it is likely that developing countries' share of emissions will
grow further to meet their social and developmental needs. Greenhouse
gas emissions are likely to become increasingly global, even whilst
substantial per capita disparities are likely to remain.
<P>
It is important that both efficiency and equity concerns should
be considered during the analysis of mitigation and adaptation
measures. It may be worthwhile to conduct analyses of the equity
implications of particular measures for achieving efficiency,
including their social considerations and impacts.
<P>
<B>5. INTERTEMPORAL EQUITY AND DISCOUNTING</B> 
<P>
Climate policy, like many other policy issues, raises particular
questions of equity among generations, because future generations
are not able to influence directly the policies being chosen today
that could affect their wellbeing and because it might not be
possible to compensate future generations for consequent reductions
in their well-being.
<P>
Sustainable development is one approach to intergenerational equity.
Sustainable development meets &quot;the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.&quot; A consensus exists among economists that this does
not imply that future generations should inherit a world with
at least as much of every resource. Nevertheless, sustainable
development would require that use of exhaustible natural resources
and environmental degradation are appropriately offset - for example,
by an increase in productive assets sufficient to enable future
generations to obtain at least the same standard of living as
those alive today. There are different views in the literature
on the extent to which infrastructure and knowledge, on the one
hand, and natural resources, such as a healthy environment, on
the other hand, are substitutes. This is crucial to applying these
concepts. Some analysts stress that there are exhaustible resources
that are unique and cannot be substituted for. Others believe
that current generations can compensate future generations for
decreases in the quality or quantity of environmental resources
by increases in other resources.
<P>
Discounting is the principal analytical tool economists use to
compare economic effects that occur at different points in time.
The choice of discount rate is of crucial technical importance
for analyses of climate change policy, because the time horizon
is extremely long, and mitigation costs tend to come much earlier
than the benefits of avoided damages. The higher the discount
rate, the less future benefits and the more current costs matter
in the analysis.
<P>
Selection of a social discount rate is also a question of values
since it inherently relates the costs of present measures, to
possible damages suffered by future generations if no action is
taken. How best to choose a discount rate is, and will likely
remain, an unresolved question in economics. Partly as a consequence,
different discount rates are used in different countries. Analysts
typically conduct sensitivity studies using various discount rates.
It should also be recognized that the social discount rate presupposes
that all effects are transformed to their equivalent in consumption.
This makes it difficult to apply to those nonmarket impacts of
climate change which for ethical reasons might not be, or for
practical reasons cannot be, converted into consumption units.
<P>
The literature on the appropriate social discount rate for climate
change analysis can be grouped into two broad categories. One
approach discounts consumption by different generations using
the &quot;social rate of time preference,&quot; which is the sum
of the rate of &quot;pure time preference&quot; (impatience) and
the rate of increase of welfare derived from higher per capita
incomes in the future. Depending upon the values taken for the
different parameters, the discount rate tends to fall between
0.5% and 3.0% per year on a global basis - using this approach.
However, wide variations in regional discount rates exist, but
these may still be consistent with a particular global average.
<P>
The second approach to the discount rate considers market returns
to investment, which range between 3% and 6% in real terms for
long-term, risk-free public investments. Conceptually, funds could
be invested in projects that earn such returns, with the proceeds
being used to increase the consumption for future generations.
<P>
The choice of the social discount rate for public investment projects
is a matter of policy preference but has a major impact on the
economic evaluation of climate change actions. For example, in
today's dollars, $1,000 of damage 100 years from now would be
valued at $370 using a 1% discount rate (near the low end of the
range for the first approach) but would be valued at $7.60 using
a 5% discount rate (near the upper end of the range for the second
approach). However, in cost-effectiveness analyses of policies
over short time horizons, the impact of using different discount
rates is much smaller. In all areas analysts should specify the
discount rate(s) they use to facilitate comparison and aggregation
of results.
<P>
<B>6. APPLICABILITY OF COST AND BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS</B> 
<P>
Many factors need to be taken into account in the evaluation of
projects and public policy issues related to climate change, including
the analysis of possible costs and benefits. Although costs and
benefits cannot all be measured in monetary terms, various techniques
exist which offer a useful framework for organizing information
about the consequences of alternative actions for addressing climate
change.
<P>
The family of analytical techniques for examining economic environmental
policies and decisions includes traditional project level cost-benefit
analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multicriteria analysis,
and decision analysis. Traditional cost-benefit analysis attempts
to compare all costs and benefits expressed in terms of a common
monetary unit. Cost-effectiveness analysis seeks to find the lowest-cost
option to achieve an objective specified using other criteria.
Multicriteria analysis is designed to deal with problems where
some benefits and/or costs are measured in nonmonetary units.
Decision analysis focuses specifically on making decisions under
uncertainty.
<P>
In principle, this group of techniques can contribute to improving
public policy decisions concerning the desirable extent of actions
to mitigate global climate change, the timing of such actions,
and the methods to be employed.
<P>
Traditional cost-benefit analysis is based on the concept that
the level of emission control at each point in time is determined
such that marginal costs equal marginal benefits. However, both
costs and benefits may be hard, sometimes impossible, to assess.
This may be due to large uncertainties, possible catastrophes
with very small probabilities, or simply because there is no available
consistent methodology for monetizing the effects. In some of
these cases, it may be possible to apply multicriteria analysis.
This provides policy makers with a broader set of information,
including evaluation of relevant costs and benefits, estimated
within a common framework.
<P>
Practical application of traditional cost-benefit analysis to
the problem of climate change is therefore difficult because of
the global, regional, and intergenerational nature of the problem.
Estimates of the costs of mitigation options also vary widely.
Furthermore, estimates of potential physical damages due to climate
change also vary widely. In addition, confidence in monetary estimates
for important consequences (especially nonmarket consequences)
is low. These uncertainties, and the resolution of uncertainty
over time may be decisive for the choice of strategies to combat
climate change. The objective of decision analysis is to deal
with such problems. Furthermore, for some categories of ecological,
cultural, and human health impacts, widely accepted economic concepts
of value are not available. To the extent that some impacts and
measures cannot be valued in monetary terms, economists augment
the traditional cost-benefit analysis approach with such techniques
as multicriteria analysis, permitting some quantitative expression
of the trade-offs to be made. These techniques do not resolve
questions involving equity - for example, determining who should
bear the costs. However, they provide important information on
the incidence of damage, mitigation, and adaptation costs and
on where cost-effective action might be taken.
<P>
Despite their many imperfections, these techniques provide a valuable
framework for identifying essential questions that policymakers
must face when dealing with climate change, namely:
<P>
&#183; By how much should emissions of greenhouse gases be reduced?
<P>
&#183; When should emissions be reduced?
<P>
&#183; How should emissions be reduced?
<P>
These analytical techniques assist decision makers in comparing
the consequences of alternative actions, including that of no
action, on a quantitative basis - and can certainly make a contribution
to resolution of these questions.
<P>
<B>7. THE SOCIAL COSTS OF ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE: DAMAGES
OF INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</B> 
<P>
The literature on the subject in this section is controversial
and mainly based on research done on developed countries, often
extrapolated to developing countries. There is no consensus about
how to value statistical lives or how to aggregate statistical
lives across countries. Monetary valuation should not obscure
the human consequences of anthropogenic climate change damages,
because the value of life has meaning beyond monetary valuation.
It should be noted that the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 call
for human beings to remain at the centre of sustainable development.
The approach taken to this valuation might affect the scale of
damage reduction strategies. It may be noted that in virtually
all of the literature discussed in this section the developing
country statistical lives have not been equally valued at the
developed country value, nor are other damages in developing countries
equally valued at the developed country value. Because national
circumstances, including opportunity costs, differ, economists
sometimes evaluate certain kinds of impacts differently amongst
countries.
<P>
The benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing
sinks are (a) the climate change damages avoided and (b) the secondary
benefits associated with the relevant policies. Secondary benefits
include reductions in other pollutants jointly produced with greenhouse
gases and the conservation of biological diversity. Net climate
change damages include both market and nonmarket impacts as far
as they can be quantified at present and, in some cases, adaptation
costs. Damages are expressed in net terms to account for the fact
that there are some beneficial impacts of global warming as well,
which are, however, dominated by the damage costs. Nonmarket impacts,
such as human health, risk of human mortality, and damage to ecosystems,
form an important component of available estimates of the social
costs of climate change. The literature on monetary valuation
of such nonmarket effects reflects a number of divergent views
and approaches. The estimates of nonmarket damages, however, are
highly speculative and not comprehensive.
<P>
Nonmarket damage estimates are a source of major uncertainty in
assessing the implications of global climate change for human
welfare. While some regard monetary valuation of such impacts
as essential to sound decision making, others reject monetary
valuation of some impacts, such as risk of human mortality, on
ethical grounds. Additionally, there is a danger that entire unique
cultures may be obliterated. This is not something that can be
considered in monetary terms, but becomes a question of loss of
human diversity, for which we have no indicators to measure economic
value.
<P>
The assessed literature contains only a few estimates of the monetized
damages associated with doubled CO2 equivalent concentration scenarios.
These estimates are aggregated to a global scale and illustrate
the potential impacts of climate change under selected scenarios.
Aggregating individual monetized damages to obtain total social
welfare impacts implies difficult decisions about equity amongst
countries. Global estimates are based upon an aggregation of monetary
damages across countries (damages which are themselves implicit
aggregations across individuals) that reflects intercountry differences
in wealth and income - this fundamentally influences the monetary
valuation of damages. Taking income differences as given implies
that an equivalent impact in two countries (such as an equal increase
in human mortality) would receive very different weights in the
calculations of global damages.
<P>
To enable choices between different ways of promoting human welfare
to be made on a consistent basis, economists have for many years
sought to express a wide range of human and environmental impacts
in terms of monetary equivalents, using various techniques. The
most commonly used of those techniques is an approach based on
the observed willingness to pay for various nonmarket benefits.
This is the approach that has been taken in most of the assessed
literature.
<P>
Human life is an element outside the market, and societies may
want to preserve it in an equal way. An approach that includes
equal valuation of impacts on human life wherever they occur may
yield different global aggregate estimates than those reported
below. For example, equalizing the value of a statistical life
at a global average could leave total global damage unchanged
but would increase markedly the share of these damages borne by
the developing world. Equalizing the value at the level typical
in developed countries would increase monetized damages several
times, and would further increase the share of the developing
countries in the total damage estimate.
<P>
Other aggregation methods can be used to adjust for differences
in the wealth or incomes of countries in calculations of monetary
damages. Because estimates of monetary damage tend to be a higher
percentage of national GDP for low-income countries than for high-income
countries, aggregation schemes that adjust for wealth or income
effects are expected to yield higher estimates of global damages
than those presented in this report.
<P>
The assessed literature quantifying total damages from 2-3&#176;C
warming provides a wide range of point estimates for damages,
given the presumed change in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
The aggregate estimates tend to be a few percent of world GDP,
with, in general, considerably higher estimates of damage to developing
countries as a share of their GDP. The aggregate estimates are
subject to considerable uncertainty, but the range of uncertainty
cannot be gauged from the literature. The range of estimates cannot
be interpreted as a confidence interval, given the widely differing
assumptions and methodologies in the studies. As noted above,
aggregation is likely to mask even greater uncertainties about
damage components.
<P>
Regional or sectoral approaches to estimating the consequences
of climate change include a much wider range of estimates of the
net economic effects. For some areas, damages are estimated to
be significantly greater and could negatively affect economic
development. For others, climate change is estimated to increase
economic production and present opportunities for economic development.
For countries generally having a diversified, industrial economy
and an educated and flexible labour force, the limited set of
published estimates of damages are of the order one to a few percent
of GDP. For countries generally having a specialized and natural
resource-based economy (e.g., heavily emphasizing agriculture
or forestry), and a poorly developed and land-tied labour force,
estimates of damages from the few studies available are several
times larger. Small islands and low-lying coastal areas are particularly
vulnerable. Damages from possible large-scale catastrophes, such
as major changes in ocean circulation, are not reflected in these
estimates. There is little agreement across studies about the
exact magnitude of each category of damages or relative ranking
of the damage categories. Climate changes of this magnitude are
not expected to be realized for several decades, and damages in
the interim could be smaller. Damages over a longer period of
time might be greater.
<P>
IPCC does not endorse any particular range of values for the marginal
damage of CO2 emissions, but published estimates range between
$5 and $125 (1990 U.S.) per tonne of carbon emitted now. This
range of estimates does not represent the full range of uncertainty.
The estimates are also based on models that remain simplistic
and are limited representations of the actual climate processes
in being and are based on earlier IPCC scientific reports. The
wide range of damage estimates reflects variations in model scenarios,
discount rates, and other assumptions. It must be emphasized that
the social cost estimates have a wide range of uncertainty because
of limited knowledge of impacts, uncertain future technological
and socioeconomic developments, and the possibility of catastrophic
events or surprises.
<P>
<B>8. GENERIC ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSE STRATEGIES</B> 
<P>
A wide range of technologies and practices is available for mitigating
emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other
greenhouse gases. There are also many adaptation measures available
for responding to the impacts of climate change. All these technologies,
practices, and measures have financial and environmental costs
as well as benefits. This section surveys the range of options
currently available or discussed in the literature. The optimal
mix of response options will vary by country and over time as
local conditions and costs change.
<P>
A review of <B>CO2</B> mitigation options suggests that:
<P>
&#183; A large potential for cost-effective <B>energy conservation
and efficiency improvements </B>in energy supply and energy use
exists in many sectors. These options offer economic and environmental
benefits in addition to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
Various of these options can be deployed rapidly due to small
unit size, modular design characteristics, and low lifetime costs.
<P>
The options for <B>CO2</B> <B>mitigation in energy use</B> include
alternative methods and efficiency improvements, among others
in the construction, residential, commercial, agriculture, and
industry sectors. Not all cost-effective strategies are based
on new technology; some may rely on improved information dissemination
and public education, managerial strategies, pricing policies,
and institutional reforms.
<P>
&#183; Estimates of the technical potential for <B>switching to
less carbon-intensive fuels</B> vary regionally and with the type
of measure and the economic availability of reserves of fossil
and alternative fuels. These estimates also have to take account
of potential methane emissions from leakage of natural gas during
production and distribution.
<P>
&#183;<B> Renewable energy technologies</B> (e.g., solar, hydroelectric,
wind, traditional and modern biomass, and ocean thermal energy
conversion) have achieved different levels of technical development,
economic maturity, and commercial readiness. The potential of
these energy sources is not fully realized. Cost estimates for
these technologies are sensitive to site-specific characteristics,
resource variability, and the form of final energy delivered.
These cost estimates vary widely.
<P>
&#183;<B> Nuclear energy</B> is a technology that has been deployed
for several decades in many countries. However, a number of factors
have slowed the expansion of nuclear power, including: (a) wary
public perceptions resulting from nuclear accidents, (b) not yet
fully resolved issues concerning reactor safety, proliferation
of fissile material, power plant decommissioning, and long-term
disposal of nuclear waste, as well as, in some instances, lower-than-anticipated
levels of demand for electricity. Regulatory and siting difficulties
have increased construction lead times, leading to higher capital
costs for this option in some countries. If these issues, including
<I>inter alia</I> the social, political, and environmental aspects
mentioned above, can be resolved, nuclear energy has the potential
to increase its present share in worldwide energy production.
<P>
&#183;<B> CO2 capture and disposal</B> may be ultimately limited
for technical and environmental reasons, because not all forms
of disposal ensure prevention of carbon reentering the atmosphere.
<P>
&#183;<B> Forestry </B>options, in some circumstances, offer large
potential, modest costs, low risk, and other benefits. Further,
the potential modern use of biomass as a source of fuels and electricity
could become attractive. Halting or slowing deforestation and
increasing reforestation through increased silvicultural productivity
and sustainable management programmes that increase agricultural
productivity, the expansion of forest reserves, and promotion
of ecotourism are among the cost-effective options for slowing
the atmospheric build-up of CO2. Forestry programmes raise important
equity considerations.
<P>
There is also a wide range of available technologies and practices
for reducing emissions of <B>methane </B>from such sources as
natural gas systems, coal mines, waste dumps, and farms. However,
the issue of reduction of emissions related to food supply may
imply trade-offs with rates of food production. These trade-offs
must be carefully assessed, as they may affect the provision of
basic needs in some countries, particularly in developing countries.
<P>
Most <B>nitrous oxide</B> emissions come from diffuse sources
related to agriculture and forestry. These emissions are difficult
to reduce rapidly. Industrial emissions of <B>nitrous oxide and
halogenated compounds</B> tend to be concentrated in a few key
sectors and tend to be easier to control. Measures to limit such
emissions may be attractive for many countries.
<P>
The slow implementation of many of the technologically attractive
and cost-effective options listed above has many possible explanations,
with both actual and perceived costs being a major factor. Among
other factors, capital availability, information gaps, institutional
obstacles, and market imperfections affect the rate of diffusion
for these technologies. Identifying the reasons specific to a
particular country is a precondition to devising sound and efficient
policies to encourage their broader adoption.
<P>
Education and training as well as information and advisory measures
are important aspects of various response options.
<P>
Many of the emission-reducing technologies and practices described
above also provide other benefits to society. These additional
benefits include improved air quality, better protection of surface
and underground waters, enhanced animal productivity, reduced
risk of explosions and fire, and improved use of energy resources.
<P>
Many options are also available for <B>adapting </B>to the impacts
of climate change and thus reducing the damages to national economies
and natural ecosystems. Adaptive options are available in many
sectors, ranging from agriculture and energy to health, coastal
zone management, offshore fisheries, and recreation. Some of these
provide enhanced ability to cope with the current impacts of climate
variability. However, possible trade-offs between implementation
of mitigation and adaptation measures are important to consider
in future research. A summary of sectoral options for adaptation
is presented in Volume 2.
<P>
The optimal response strategy for each country will depend on
the special circumstances and conditions which that country must
face. Nonetheless, many recent studies and empirical observations
suggest that some of the most cost-effective options can be most
successfully implemented on a joint or cooperative basis among
nations.
<P>
<B>9. COSTS OF RESPONSE OPTIONS</B> 
<P>
It must be emphasized that the text in this section is an assessment
of the technical literature and does not make recommendations
on policy matters. The available literature is primarily from
developed countries.
<P>
<U>Cost Concepts</U> 
<P>
From the perspective of this section on assessing mitigation or
adaptation costs, what matters is the net cost (total cost less
secondary benefits and costs). These net costs exclude the social
costs of climate change, which are discussed in Section 7. The
assessed literature yields a very wide range of estimates of the
costs of response options. The wide range largely reflects significant
differences in assumptions about the efficiency of energy and
other markets, and about the ability of government institutions
to address perceived market failures or imperfections.
<P>
Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may yield additional
economic impacts (for example, through technological externalities
associated with fostering research and development programmes)
and/or environmental impacts (such as reduced emissions of acid
rain and urban smog precursors). Studies suggest that the secondary
environmental benefits may be substantial but are likely to differ
from country to country.
<P>
<U>Specific Results</U> 
<P>
Estimates of the cost of greenhouse gas emission reduction depend
critically upon assumptions about the levels of energy efficiency
improvements in the baseline scenario (that is, in the absence
of climate policy) and upon a wide range of factors such as consumption
patterns, resource and technology availability, the desired level
and timing of abatement, and the choice of policy instruments.
Policymakers should not place too much confidence in the specific
numerical results from any one analysis. For example, mitigation
cost analyses reveal the costs of mitigation relative to a given
baseline, but neither the baseline nor the intervention scenarios
should be interpreted as representing likely future conditions.
The focus should be on the general insights regarding the underlying
determinants of costs.
<P>
The costs of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases at levels and within a time frame that will prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system (the ultimate
objective of the FCCC) will be critically dependent on the choice
of emission timepath. The cost of the abatement programme will
be influenced by the rate of capital replacement, the discount
rate, and the effect of research and development.
<P>
Failure to adopt policies as early as possible to encourage efficient
replacement investments at the end of the economic life of a plant
and equipment (i.e., at the point of capital stock turnover) imposes
an economic cost to society. Implementing emission reductions
at rates that can be absorbed in the course of normal stock turnover
is likely to be cheaper than enforcing premature retirement now.
<P>
The choice of abatement paths thus involves balancing the economic
risks of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk
of delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitating
premature retirement of future capital stock.)
<P>
Appropriate long-run signals are required to allow producers and
consumers to adapt cost-effectively to constraints on greenhouse
gas emissions and to encourage research and development. Benefits
associated with the implementation of any &quot;no-regret&quot;
policies will offset, at least in part, the costs of a full portfolio
of mitigation measures. This will also increase the time available
to learn about climate risks and to bring new technologies into
the market place.
<P>
Despite significant differences in views, there is agreement that
energy efficiency gains of perhaps 10% to 30% below baseline trends
over the next two to three decades can be realized at negative
to zero net cost. (Negative net cost means an economic benefit).
With longer time horizons, which allow a more complete turnover
of capital stocks, and which give research and development and
market transformation policies a chance to impact multiple replacement
cycles, this potential is much higher. The magnitude of such &quot;no-regret&quot;
potentials depends upon the existence of substantial market or
institutional imperfections that prevent cost-effective emission
reduction measures from occurring. The key question is then the
extent to which such imperfections and barriers can be removed
cost-effectively by policy initiatives such as efficiency standards,
incentives, removal of subsidies, information programmes, and
funding of technology transfer.
<P>
Progress has been made in a number of countries in cost-effectively
reducing imperfections and institutional barriers in markets through
policy instruments based on voluntary agreements, energy efficiency
incentives, product efficiency standards, and energy efficiency
procurement programmes involving manufacturers, as well as utility
regulatory reforms. Where empirical evaluations have been made,
many have found the benefit-cost ratio of increasing energy efficiency
to be favourable, suggesting the practical feasibility of realizing
&quot;no-regret&quot; potentials at negative net cost. More information
is needed on similar and improved programmes in a wider range
of countries.
<P>
Infrastructure decisions are critical in determining long-term
emission<STRIKE>s</STRIKE> and abatement costs because they can
enhance or restrict the number and type of future options. Infrastructure
decisions determine development patterns in transportation, urban
settlement, and land use and influence energy system development
and deforestation patterns. This issue is of particular importance
to developing countries and many economies in transition where
major infrastructure decisions will be made in the near term.
<P>
If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy instrument
for reducing emissions, the taxes could raise substantial revenues,
and how the revenues are distributed could dramatically affect
the cost of mitigation. If the revenues are distributed by reducing
distortionary taxes in the existing system, they will help reduce
the excess burden of the existing tax system, potentially yielding
an additional economic benefit (double dividend). For example,
those European studies which are more optimistic regarding the
potential for tax recycling show lower and, in some instances,
slightly negative costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of
the tax revenues could increase costs. For example, if the tax
revenues are used to finance government programmes that yield
a lower return than the private sector investments foregone because
of the tax, then overall costs will increase.
<P>
There are large differences in the costs of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions among countries because of their state of economic
development, infrastructure choices, and natural resource base.
This indicates that international cooperation could significantly
reduce the global cost of reducing emissions. Research suggests
that, in principle, substantial savings would be possible if emissions
are reduced where it is cheapest to do so. In practice, this requires
international mechanisms ensuring appropriate capital flows and
technology transfers between countries. Conversely, a failure
to achieve international cooperation could compromise unilateral
attempts by a country or a group of countries to limit greenhouse
gas emissions. However, estimates of so called leakage effects
vary so widely that they provide little guidance to policymakers.
<P>
There has been more analysis to date of emission reduction potentials
and costs for developed countries than for other parts of the
world. Moreover, many existing models are not well-suited to study
economies in transition or economies of developing countries.
Much work is needed to develop and apply models for use outside
developed countries (for example, to represent more explicitly
market imperfections, institutional barriers, and traditional
and informal economic sectors). In addition, the discussion below
and the bulk of the underlying report deal with costs of response
options at the national or regional level in terms of effect on
GDP. Further analysis is required concerning effects of response
options on employment, inflation, trade competitiveness, and other
public issues.
<P>
A large number of studies using both top-down and bottom-up approaches
(see box for definitions) were reviewed. Estimates of the costs
of limiting fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions (expressed as
carbon) vary widely and depend upon choice of methodologies, underlying
assumptions, emission scenarios, policy instruments, reporting
year, and other criteria. For specific results of individual studies,
see Chapter 9.
<P>
<B>OECD Countries</B>. Although it is difficult to generalize,
top-down analyses suggest that the costs of substantial reductions
below 1990 levels could be as high as several percent of GDP.
In the specific case of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels,
most studies estimate that annual costs in the range of -0.5%
of GDP (equivalent to a gain of about $60 billion in total for
OECD countries at today's GDP levels) to 2% of GDP (equivalent
to a loss of about $240 billion) could be reached over the next
several decades. However, studies also show that appropriate timing
of abatement measures and the availability of low-cost alternatives
may substantially reduce the size of the overall bill.
<P>
Bottom-up studies are more optimistic about the potential for
low or negative cost emission reductions, and the capacity to
implement that potential. Such studies show that the costs of
reducing emissions by 20% in developed countries within two to
three decades are negligible to negative. Other bottom-up studies
suggest that there exists a potential for absolute reductions
in excess of 50% in the longer term, without increasing and perhaps
even reducing total energy system costs.
<P>
The results of top-down and bottom-up analyses differ because
of such factors as higher estimates of no-regrets potential and
technological progress, and earlier saturation in energy services
per unit GDP. In the most favourable assessments, savings of 10-20%
in the total cost of energy services can be achieved.
<P>
<B>Economies in transition</B>. The potential for cost-effective
reductions in energy use is apt to be considerable, but the realizable
potential will depend upon what economic and technological development
path is chosen, as well as the availability of capital to pursue
different paths. A critical issue is the future of structural
changes in these countries that are apt to change dramatically
the level of baseline emissions and the emission reduction costs.
<P>
<B>Developing countries</B>. Analyses suggest that there may be
substantial low-cost fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission reduction
opportunities for developing countries. Development pathways that
increase energy efficiency, promote alternative energy technologies,
reduce deforestation, and enhance agricultural productivity and
biomass energy production can be economically beneficial. To embark
upon this pathway may require significant international cooperation
and financial and technology transfers. However, these are likely
to be insufficient to offset rapidly increasing emissions baselines,
associated with increased economic growth and overall welfare.
Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is likely to be costly.
<P>
It should be noted that analyses of costs to economies in transition
and developing countries typically neglect the general equilibrium
effects of unilateral actions taken by developed countries. These
effects may be either positive or negative and their magnitude
is difficult to quantify.
<P>
It should also be noted that estimates of costs or benefits of
the order of a few percent of GDP may represent small differences
in GDP growth rates, but are nevertheless substantial in absolute
terms.
<P>
Preservation and augmentation of carbon sinks offer a substantial
and often cost-effective component of a greenhouse gas mitigation
strategy. Studies suggest that as much as 15-30% of 1990 global
energy-related emissions could be offset by carbon sequestration
in forests for a period of 50-100 years. The costs of carbon sequestration,
which are competitive with source control options, may differ
among regions of the world.
<P>
Control of emissions of other greenhouse gases, especially methane
and nitrous oxide, can provide significant cost-effective opportunities
in some countries. About 10% of anthropogenic methane emissions
could be reduced at negative or low cost using available mitigation
options for such methane sources as natural gas systems, waste
management, and agriculture.
<P>
<B>10. INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT</B> 
<P>
Integrated assessment models combine knowledge from a wide range
of disciplines to provide insights that would not be observed
through traditional disciplinary research. They are used to explore
possible states of human and natural systems, analyze key questions
related to policy formulation, and help set research priorities.
Integration helps coordinate assumptions from different disciplines
and allows feedbacks and interactions absent from individual disciplines
to be analyzed. However, the results of such analyses are no better
than the information drawn from the underlying economic, atmospheric,
and biological sciences. Integrated assessment models are limited
both by the underlying knowledge base upon which they draw and
by the relatively limited experiential base.
<P>
Most current integrated assessment models do not reflect the specific
social and economic dynamics of the developing and transition
economies well; for example, none of the existing models addresses
most market imperfections, institutional barriers, or the operation
of the informal sector in these countries. This can lead to biases
in global assessments when mitigation options and impacts on developing
or transition economies are valued as if their economies operated
like those in the developed countries.
<P>
While relatively new, integrated assessment models of climate
change have evolved rapidly. Integrated assessment models tend
to fall into two categories: <I>policy evaluation</I> and <I>policy
optimization</I> models. Policy evaluation models are rich in
physical detail and have been used to analyze the potential for
deforestation as a consequence of interactions between demographics,
agricultural productivity, and economic growth, and the relationship
between climate change and the extent of potentially malarial
regions. Policy optimization models optimize over key variables
(e.g., emission rates, carbon taxes) to achieve formulated policy
goals (e.g., cost minimization or welfare optimization).
<P>
Key uncertainties in current integrated assessments include the
sensitivity of the climate system to changes in greenhouse gas
concentrations, the specification and valuation of impacts where
there are no markets, changes in national and regional demographics,
the choice of discount rates, and assumptions regarding the cost,
availability, and diffusion of technologies.
<P>
<B>11. AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS TO COMBAT
CLIMATE CHANGE</B> 
<P>
Governments may have different sets of criteria for assessing
international as well as domestic greenhouse policy instruments.
Among these criteria are efficiency and cost-effectiveness, effectiveness
in achieving stated environmental targets, distributional (including
intergenerational) equity, flexibility in the face of new knowledge,
understandability to the general public, and consistency with
national priorities, policies, institutions and traditions. The
choice of instruments may also partly reflect a desire on the
part of governments to achieve other objectives, such as sustainable
economic development, meeting social development goals and fiscal
targets, or influencing pollution levels that are indirectly related
to greenhouse gas emissions. A further concern of governments
may lie with the effect of policies on competitiveness.
<P>
The world economy and indeed some individual national economies
suffer from a number of price distortions which increase greenhouse
gas emissions, such as some agricultural and fuel subsidies and
distortions in transport pricing. A number of studies of this
issue indicate that global emission reductions of 4-18%, together
with increases in real incomes, are possible from phasing out
fuel subsidies. For the most part, reducing such distortions could
lower emissions and increase economic efficiency. However, subsidies
are often introduced and price distortions maintained for social
and distributional reasons, and they may be difficult to remove.
<P>
Policy instruments may be identified at two different levels:
those that might be used by a group of countries and those that
might be used by individual nations unilaterally or to achieve
compliance with a multilateral agreement.
<P>
A group of countries may choose from policy measures and instruments
including encouragement of voluntary actions and further research,
tradable quotas, joint implementation (specifically activities
implemented jointly under the pilot phase), harmonized domestic
carbon taxes, international carbon taxes, nontradable quotas,
and various international standards. If the group did not include
all major greenhouse gas emitters, then there might be a tendency
for fossil fuel use to increase in countries not participating
in this group. This outcome might reduce the international competitiveness
of some industries in participating countries as well as the environmental
effectiveness of the countries' efforts.
<P>
At both the international and national levels, the economic literature
indicates that instruments that provide economic incentives, such
as taxes and tradable quotas/permits, are likely to be more cost-effective
than other approaches. Uniform standards among groups of countries
participating in an international agreement are likely to be difficult
to achieve. However, for one group of countries there has been
agreement on the application of some uniform standards.
<P>
At the international level, all of the potentially efficient market-based
instruments could be examined during the course of future negotiations.
A tradable quota system has the disadvantage of making the marginal
cost of emissions uncertain, while a carbon tax (and related instruments)
has the disadvantage of leaving the effect on the level at which
emissions are controlled uncertain. The weight given to the importance
of reducing these different types of uncertainty would be one
crucial factor in further evaluating these alternative instruments.
Because of the lack of appropriate scientific knowledge, there
would remain a high degree of uncertainty about the results of
limiting emissions at specific levels. The adoption of either
a tradable quota scheme or international taxes would have implications
for the international distribution of wealth. The distributional
consequences would be the subject of negotiation. To insure the
practicability of such instruments, there is a need for additional
studies on the possible design of tradable quotas and harmonized
taxes and on the institutional framework in which they might operate.
<P>
Individual countries that seek to implement mitigation policies
can choose from among a large set of potential policies and instruments,
including carbon taxes, tradable permits, deposit refund systems
(and related instruments), and subsidies, as well as technology
standards, performance standards, product bans, direct government
investment, and voluntary agreements. Public education on the
sustainable use of resources could play an important part in modifying
consumption patterns and other human behaviour. The choice of
measures at the domestic level may reflect objectives other than
cost-effectiveness, such as meeting fiscal targets. Revenue from
carbon taxes or auctioned tradable permits could be used to replace
existing distortionary taxes. The choice of instruments may also
reflect other environmental objectives, such as reducing non-greenhouse
pollution emissions, or increasing forest cover, or other concerns
such as specific impacts on particular regions or communities.
<P>
<B>Box 1: Top-Down and Bottom-Up Models</B> 
<P>
Top-down models are aggregate models of the entire macroeconomy
that draw on analysis of historical trends and relationships to
predict the large-scale interactions between the sectors of the
economy, especially the interactions between the energy sector
and the rest of the economy. Top-down models typically incorporate
relatively little detail on energy consumption and technological
change compared with bottom-up models.
<P>
In contrast, bottom-up models incorporate detailed studies of
the engineering costs of a wide range of available and forecast
technologies and describe energy consumption in great detail.
However, compared with top-down models, they typically incorporate
relatively little detail on nonenergy consumer behaviour and interactions
with other sectors of the economy.
<P>
This simple characterization of top-down and bottom-up models
is increasingly misleading as more recent versions of each approach
have tended to provide greater detail in the aspects that were
less developed in the past. As a result of this convergence in
model structure, model results are tending to converge, and the
remaining differences reflect differences in assumptions about
how rapidly and effectively market institutions adopt cost-effective
new technologies or can be induced to adopt them by policy interventions.
<P>
Many existing models are not well suited to study economies in
transition or those of developing countries. More work is needed
to develop the appropriate methodologies, data, and models and
to build the local institutional capacity to undertake analyses.
