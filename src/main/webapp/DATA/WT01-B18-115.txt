<H2>Using Consumer Preferences in Health Care  Decision Making: the Application of Conjoint Analysis by Dr Mandy Ryan</H2><br>
<H3>ASK PATIENTS WHAT SERVICES THE NHS SHOULD PROVIDE</H3>
<P>
Patients should be asked which services the NHS should provide more of - and which should be provided less - in a way that can
be used by NHS doctors and managers, according to this OHE report by Dr Mandy Ryan.
<P>
NHS purchasers are under pressure to consult the public about NHS priorities, and hospitals want to know what matters to patients.
 This report proposes the use of a technique known as conjoint analysis which is commonly used in the private sector and in other
parts of the public sector.  It can be used to ask the real questions facing hard-pressed doctors and managers, and provide a genuine
public input into NHS decision-making.  Conjoint analysis provides this information by asking individuals to make choices between
different aspects of service and types of service.
<P>
By structuring the questions carefully, the strength of preferences can be established across a wide range of different services.
 Crucially, people have to indicate what they will give up to have more of something else.
<P>
The report criticises public opinion surveys and patient satisfaction surveys as too general to enable NHS purchasers to incorporate
into their everyday decision-making.  The views of the author are supported in an earlier study for the Treasury by a team of
academics from the University of Brunel, who argued for this technique to be widely used in the public sector.
