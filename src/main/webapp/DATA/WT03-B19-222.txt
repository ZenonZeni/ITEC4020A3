<P>
Co-operative Research Centres were established under a Federal Government initiative to encourage research groups in universities, government laboratories and private industry to collaborate in world class research, and so utilise more effectively the considerable R&D resources available to Australian businesses.
<P>
CRCs in Victoria cover several industry sectors, including food processing, engineering, and information technology and telecommunications.
<P>
The 14 CRCs headquartered in Victoria represent approximately $186 million or 22%  of the total Federal Government funding of $844 million over seven years, and $87 million or 22% of industry funding of $387 million over the same period. This represents a considerable R&D resource in Victoria.
<P>
The Victorian Government, through Business Victoria, has close links with the State's CRCs, and has developed a <A HREF="../dbecrc.html">$200,000 program</A> to help Victorian businesses and research centres reap the benefits of  R&D.
<P>
Specifically, the program's objectives are to assist small to medium-sized businesses to gain access to CRC facilities and services, and to enhance the commercial and export potential of CRC products and services.
<P>
By working together with the CRCs and the business community in this way, Business Victoria aims to promote industry development and innovation, attract investment and maximise economic benefits to the State.
