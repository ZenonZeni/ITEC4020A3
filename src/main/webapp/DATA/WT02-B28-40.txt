	To maintain its top ratings, which became more important as the 1980s rolled on, New York
Life
moved cautiously into making some major investment portfolio adjustments.  In 1982, the
company
smoothly completed a $1.6 billion restructuring of its pension fund portfolio, which
measurably
increased the quality of its security holdings.  This immense transaction, achieved with the
help of
trading experts at Salomon Brothers, involved the sale of 104 issues and the purchase of 57
others. 
Computer simulation prior to the actual event made the transaction go through without a
glitch.<P>
	The stock market crash of 1987 prompted another major shift in investment strategy.  In
October
1987, the stock market lost twenty-two percent of its value in a day after five fat years
during which the
Dow Jones industrial average roared from below 1000 to 2700.  New York Life saw the value of
its bond
portfolio rise sharply as the stock market tumbled.<P>
	Competition for consumers' dollars brought intense challenges to New York Life's
individual
insurance operations.  More and more Americans were making a distinction between the
protection
afforded by insurance and the investment potential of permanent, cash value insurance, which
they
viewed as inferior to CDs and other investments.  The logic of this comparison seemed to
dictate "buy
term and invest the difference."<P>
	Anyone combing through the $8 trillion financial-services world in the late 1980s for a
blue-chip firm
with the ability to tailor products to the needs of all sorts of individuals and groups would
find the search
daunting.  Credit ratings systems were so lax, by design or otherwise, the resulting
information could
really turn out to be misinformation.<P>
	Some straight talk was needed about the value of safety, security and conservatism in
the investment
field.  "The Company You Keep" slogan was first seen by American consumers September 17,
1989, in
a New York Life TV commercial.<P>
	Plenty of investors had been burned in the biggest stock market crash of all time just
two years
earlier.  In a culture of seemingly permanent change, when beliefs as well as institutions
were
crumbling everywhere, a simple message had appeal:  good, old, reliable New York Life was as
sound
as ever.
