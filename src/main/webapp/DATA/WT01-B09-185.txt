<FONT SIZE=2>We are pleased to present to you the results of the
Mountain Forum membership survey, conducted in order to obtain
baseline demographic information on Mountain Forum constituents,
as well as information on members' electronic capabilities, regional
interests and affiliation, and hopes for the Forum. Background
data from surveys provide a powerful tool to help guide and shape
the Mountain Forum's evolution. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From June through mid-October 1996, 201people had
submitted survey forms to the Mountain Forum's regional offices.
This report was complied by the Information Server Node, and reflect
global Mountain Forum membership. Survey results will be updated
every three months with the next scheduled update for February
28, 1997. <I>(Note: Many questions allowed for multiple answers,
thus totals may be more than 201 members, and percentages may
total more than 100%).<BR>

accessible. Therefore, I also prefer written, paper communication</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Electronic change of real images (scanned images)
which may help us create publications. This change of images must
be based on a database w/ scanned images, &amp; can be an attractive
facilitation.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Establish a list of interesting &amp; innovative
integrated &amp; sustainable development projects or case studies
all over the mountain areas of the world</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Exchange of ideas through debates, discussion,
meeting, seminar and workshops</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>How could we contribute to this forum if we don't
have the technical facilities yet?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>I moderate an InSitu list called &quot;Workshop
in Situ95 or 96&quot;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>I need a personal computer to be more efficient
inside the electronic networking services of the Mountain Forum.
A Macintosh?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>I think the opportunity should be taken to develop
in Mountain Forum an OPEN LEARNING/DISTANCE TEACHING function
as in the UK (Open University which has 1/4 million students)
but also exploring a more popular medium.</FONT>

topics;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>In most cases with developing countries, modern
electronic communication advances are still very scanty.</FONT>

to reinforce and maintain the nature of decentralized regionally
based organization</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>It needs to review the impact of its activities
in various governmental and non-governmental sectors. This will
