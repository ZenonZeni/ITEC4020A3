<H4><a name="4.9">Natural Gas: Increasing Efficient Utilization</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to maximize the economic, environmental, and national security
benefits of increased use of natural gas. To implement this policy, the Administration focuses on
collaboration with industry to develop advanced natural gas technologies, provide incentives for
increased exploration and production, stimulate end-use markets, and continue regulatory reforms
that reduce costs and increase efficiency.<BR>
<P>
Natural gas provides approximately 24 percent of the energy consumed in the United States,
heating 57 percent of U.S. homes and serving 175 million consumers. Approximately 45 percent
of natural gas delivered to end-users is used to provide energy in the industrial sector, 14 percent is
used to generate electricity, and 16 percent is used in the commercial sector. In 1993, more than
300,000 Americans were employed in the search for and production of crude oil and natural gas,
while an additional 196,000 Americans were employed by U.S. natural gas utilities. <BR>
<P>
The United States has a vast <a name="recgas"></a><a href="ch4bx3.html">recoverable natural gas resource</a> base. In its 1992 study, the National Petroleum Council estimates a technically recoverable gas resource base for the lower 48 States of 1,295 trillion cubic feet (tcf), sufficient gas to meet U.S. demand at current levels for about 60 years. The U.S. Geological Survey projects that technically recoverable onshore natural gas reserves in the United States are about 1,074 tcf, 11 percent higher than their 1989 estimate.  Moreover, our North American Free Trade Agreement partners, Canada and Mexico, also have large supplies of natural gas that can help us to reduce the growth of oil imports from unstable
sources.<BR>
<P>
Natural gas has fewer harmful effects on the environment than other fossil fuels. Natural gas has
virtually no sulfur emissions, lower emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and extremely low
particulate emissions. Natural gas has approximately 30 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions
than oil and 45 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal on an energy-equivalent basis.
Finally, natural gas combustion does not generate solid waste. Increased use of natural gas is a
cornerstone of the Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, as one of the measures used to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.<BR>
<P>
Over the past two decades, natural gas markets have become increasingly competitive, largely
because of Federal legislation and regulatory reforms. The sale of natural gas at the wellhead has
been deregulated, and the interstate transportation of natural gas has been opened to third parties.
These reforms have provided natural gas consumers with the ability to shop for the most
economic gas supplies.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.10">Partnering With Industry To Develop Advanced Natural Gas Technologies</H4></a>
Through the Department of Energy's natural gas supply R&D program, the Administration is
investing in a new generation of technologies to reduce the cost, ensure long-term supply, and
increase the use of natural gas.<BR>
<P>
In the 21st century, natural gas supply will depend increasingly on drilling and producing from
reservoirs that are more difficult to develop because of their depth and size, hardness of the rock,
lack of permeability, or the quality of the natural gas they contain. New advanced drilling system
technology to induce fractures or to locate and drill through natural fractures is needed to convert
such natural gas resources into proved reserves. These technologies will address both the technical
barriers in such areas as 3-D seismology, horizontal drilling, and fracture detection, as well as the
cost savings associated with drilling faster and with less damage to the reservoir.<BR>
<P>
By 2010, it is estimated that domestic natural gas production linked to deployment of advanced
exploration and production technologies supported by the Administration will be 2 trillion cubic
feet per year, or about 10 percent of current U.S. consumption<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's natural gas R&D program focuses increasingly on the development
and deployment of the best and most efficient natural gas end-use technologies, such as natural
gas-fired space air-conditioning equipment for residential and commercial applications; natural
gas-fueled vehicles that are more reliable, produce lower emissions, and have longer cruising
ranges than the current generation vehicles; high-efficiency, industrial gas turbines with low
nitrogen oxide emissions to meet future electricity generation needs; and fuel cells that chemically
convert natural gas to electricity at efficiencies of 50 to 60 percent.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.11">Providing Appropriate Incentives To Increase Exploration and Production</H4></a>
The Administration supports providing appropriate revenue-neutral incentives to increase natural
gas exploration and production. The Administration is exploring a royalty rate reduction for
onshore marginal natural gas wells, similar to the "Stripper Program" rule currently in effect for
oil, that will conserve resources, improve ultimate recovery of finite resources, increase the
domestic natural gas reserve base, and promote the production of natural gas.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.12">Stimulating Markets for Natural Gas Use</H4></a>
The two markets with the largest growth potential for natural gas are transportation vehicles and
electricity generation. The Administration is working to stimulate these markets by purchasing
natural gas vehicles for Federal fleets, by providing tax incentives, and by encouraging the use of
natural gas for electric power generation.<BR>
<P>
As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Federal Government is providing leadership in
purchasing alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs), including natural gas vehicles, for Federal fleets. In
1993, by executive order, the President increased the AFV targets. By the end of fiscal year 1994,
the Federal Government had purchased 6,700 natural gas vehicles. Using fiscal year 1995 funds,
the Federal Government plans to purchase an additional 9,250 natural gas vehicles. These
purchases represent 59 percent of planned Federal AFV stock, and 20 percent of natural gas
vehicles nationwide.<BR>
<P>
To promote further the penetration of natural gas vehicles into the transportation sector, the Federal
Government provides tax deductions for AFV purchases, including natural gas vehicles, of up to
$2,000 per vehicle, and for AFV refueling facilities of up to $100,000 per location.<BR>
<P>
It is likely that at least half of all new electricity generation capacity to be added in the United States
over the next 20 years will be natural gas-fired. New gas turbines and combined-cycle technology
are making gas the fuel of choice for many utilities, and these technologies have been improved
through Federal R&D efforts. However, a principal impediment to increasing utility market
penetration by natural gas is electric utilities' concern about reliable, long-term natural gas supplies.
The Administration, through the Department of Energy and the Energy Information
Administration, is working to allay these concerns by providing timely data on the availability and
deliverability of domestic natural gas supplies.<BR>
<P>
By 2010, commercial deployment of advanced natural gas power technologies supported by the
Administration is projected to attain 16 gigawatts of electric capacity investment per year in
domestic and export markets.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.13">Reforming Regulations To Reduce Costs and Increase Efficiency</H4></a>
The Administration supports continued regulatory reform throughout the Federal Government to
reduce the cost of natural gas exploration and production and to increase efficiency in natural gas
markets. The regulatory reforms described in the Oil section of this chapter apply to the
exploration and development of natural gas as well. In addition, the Administration has explored
regulatory reforms that could expand the role of natural gas in end-use markets.<BR>
<P>
Sales of natural gas occur in markets where regulation influences consumers' decisions regarding
the commercial attractiveness of the fuel. The Administration will continue to promote a
competitive natural gas industry that offers more and better choices to energy consumers. To this
end, the Administration supports regulatory reforms to ensure a more robust secondary market for
interstate natural gas pipeline transportation capacity, to promote efficient and fair pricing of natural
gas transportation service, and to expedite the construction of new facilities to ensure reliable
natural gas delivery. The Department of Energy continues to support, on a collaborative basis,
States that are examining their regulations to bring the benefits of competition to retail natural gas
markets.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.14">Electricity: Promoting Competition in the National Interest </H4></a>
The electric power sector is the largest direct energy consumer in the United States, using 36
percent of all primary energy consumed in 1994, while providing power worth approximately
$200 billion annually to residential, commercial, and industrial users. The electric power
sector-including investor-owned, municipal and cooperatively owned, independent, and federally
owned power-has a combined capital investment of several hundred billion dollars, making this
sector one of the largest and most important economic sectors in the United States.<BR>
<P>
Over the past two decades, U.S. demand for electricity grew by about 3 percent per year, but this
growth in demand is expected to be slower between now and 2010, averaging slightly more than 1
percent per year. To meet the growing demand for electricity between 1975 and 1994, electric
utilities increased their annual consumption of primary energy by 10.5 quads. As shown in Figure
15, greater use of coal and nuclear power accounted for all of the increase, while also displacing
more than 2 quads of oil use per year. Currently, more than half the Nation's electricity is generated from coal, a share that most analysts expect to remain essentially steady for the next decade or two.  Nuclear power supplies 22 percent of total generation. Natural gas and renewables (including hydroelectric power) each account for about 10 percent, and the shares of both natural gas and nonhydroelectric renewables are expected to increase steadily over the next decade.<BR>
<P>
The U.S. electricity industry is in a period of fundamental change. The next several years will see a
transformation of the industry, affecting its organizational structure, the products and services it
delivers to customers, and the Federal and State institutions that regulate it. The transformation of
the industry and its regulatory institutions is being driven by a combination of forces, including the
following:<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Broad recognition that the electricity-generation sector no longer is a natural monopoly and could be substantially deregulated<BR>
<P>
<li>Statutory changes, such as the Energy Policy Act of 1992, that promote increased
competition in bulk power markets<BR>
<P>
<li>Large disparities in electric rates from utility to utility, which encourage customers to seek
access to lower cost suppliers<BR>
<P>
<li>New low-cost generation technologies, which offer cheaper power and reduce the
economic value of existing traditional generation equipment<BR>
<P>
<li>The generally successful overall experience in recent years with reduced regulation in other
industries (for example, telecommunications and natural gas)</ul>
 
<H4><a name="4.15">Restructuring the Industry To Link Competition with National Goals</H4></a>
The Administration believes that prudent restructuring of the electricity industry should increase
competition, reduce consumers' electricity-related costs, maintain environmental protection, and
enhance economic productivity. Although complete deregulation of the industry is not possible
because transmission and distribution networks are still natural monopolies, there are significant
opportunities to increase competition in the industry. Many proposals for increasing competition
are now being considered at the State level. Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) has begun to consider appropriate changes in Federal regulations to
accommodate greater competition under the existing statutory framework. On March 29, 1995, the
FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that addresses key issues involved in moving
toward a more competitive wholesale electricity marketplace.<BR>
<P>
The Administration supports the scope and direction of the Commission's proposed rulemaking as
a constructive, even essential, starting point for enabling greater competition. Significant national
issues must be addressed under the general rubric of competition and restructuring as individual
State and Federal regulatory reform efforts evolve. These fall into two main categories: the near-
term transitional issues of stranded assets and the long-term design issues of stranded benefits.<BR>
<P>
Stranded Assets. Stranded assets (sometimes called stranded costs) refer to prudent investments
incurred or contracts entered under the existing regulatory framework whose costs are unlikely to
be recovered under more competitive market conditions. Examples include high-cost generating
units and some above-market contracts for wholesale power and fuels. These one-time transition
costs could be borne by investors or consumers, or both, depending on the restructuring policy
pursued. The extent to which the owners of these assets are forced to absorb the loss in economic
value or are able to recover costs in electricity rates during a transition period will partly determine
the structure of the emerging competitive industry. Because resolving the debate over stranded cost
recovery will accelerate the introduction of competition in the electricity industry, the
Administration supports restructuring proposals that address stranded cost issues in a fair and
equitable manner.<BR>
<P>
State and Federal regulators exploring competition have solicited ideas and suggestions regarding
appropriate mechanisms for potential recovery of stranded assets. One potential national issue is
the performance of nuclear power stations in competitive markets and the subsequent implications
for civilian radioactive waste disposal policy in the near term. The Administration will continue to
evaluate moves toward competition in terms of their impact on the civilian waste disposal
program.<BR>
<P>
Stranded Benefits. Stranded benefits refer to systemwide and social objectives currently served by
the regulated market that may be vulnerable under more competitive electricity markets. These
long-term design goals include ensuring system reliability, promoting end-use efficiency and
renewable energy investments, providing sufficient electricity-related R&D, encouraging
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, incorporating environmental considerations into resource
selection, and making minimum levels of service available to low-income consumers. The
Administration will support proposals for restructuring that promote the continued achievement of
these important electricity-related public policy objectives.<BR>
<P>
Many analysts question the ability of a competitive industry to provide a high level of efficiency
investments and services currently supported by utilities' integrated resource planning and demand-
side management efforts. Under some scenarios of market evolution, service providers vying for
differentiated market niches could promote aggressive efficiency measures by offering innovative
energy service contracts that would overcome traditional market barriers to demand-side
investments. Under other scenarios, however, intense commodity competition for the cheapest
electric power would deter innovative service providers, and market barriers would continue to
inhibit cost-effective energy-efficiency investments. Until more information emerges from State-
level competitive experiments, the Administration will support only those restructuring efforts
designed to enable high levels of cost-effective energy-efficiency investments.<BR>
<P>
The same commitment also extends to ensuring a strong market for renewable energy investments
and an appropriate level of electricity-related R&D conducted by a more competitive sector. The
Administration will continue to work with States, the FERC, Congress, the industry, and
consumer and environmental interests to ensure that greater competition in the electricity
marketplace serves the needs of consumers, investors, and the environment now and into the
future.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.16">Examining the Statutory Framework</H4></a>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the statutory framework that enables the market to
move toward greater competition. Recently, some utilities and other stakeholders have proposed
abolishing two key statutes that circumscribe and, detractors claim, unnecessarily hinder more
rapid movement toward a competitive market. The first is the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 (PUHCA), which significantly constrains the investments, financing mechanisms, and
corporate structures available to electric utility companies. The second is Section 210 of the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which encourages cogeneration and renewable energy
by requiring utilities to purchase electricity from designated generating sources at rates established
by State regulators under Federal guidelines.<BR>
<P>
Both statutes have played important roles in limiting anticompetitive behavior by utility
monopolies. Although market conditions have changed substantially since their inception, these
statutes continue to provide important safeguards and incentives that benefit consumers during the
present phase of industry evolution. As a clearer picture of industry structure and competitive
operation emerges from State actions and the FERC's ongoing regulatory reforms, however,
modifications of these statutes or their implementing regulations may become warranted. Given
the current status of industry restructuring proposals and the significant potential for greater
competition under the existing statutory framework, the Administration opposes the repeal of
Section 210 of PURPA at this time. However, the Administration will continue to assess the
prospects for changing regulatory implementation or undertaking statutory reforms of PURPA
and PUHCA in view of the national objectives of reliable, clean, and economic energy resources.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.17">Renewable Energy: Increasing Long-Term Investments</H4></a>
The Administration's energy policy promotes the development and deployment of renewable
energy resources and technologies in the United States and abroad. By helping to reduce costs and
by stimulating market adoption of U.S. renewable energy technologies, energy policy can
accelerate the environmental, economic, and security benefits of increased use of renewable
resources.	<BR>
<P>
The United States has an abundance of renewable energy resources. Renewable energy-which
includes photovoltaic, solar thermal, biomass (wood, wood waste, refuse, agricultural
commodities, both traditional and new, and agricultural waste), wind, geothermal, and hydropower technologies-accounts for approximately 10 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. Renewable resources also can be used as feedstocks from which to derive alternative transportation fuels, such as those derived from biomass. In addition, solar energy systems for space heating, water heating, and process heat augment energy supply by reducing demand for conventional energy resources.<BR>
<P>
During the last 15 years, intensive work by industry and the Department of Energy's national
laboratories has steadily increased the reliability of renewable energy systems while dramatically
lowering their costs. These systems are gradually becoming commercially competitive with
conventional power sources. Today, wind-generated electricity is nearly competitive with
conventional electric power in several regions; the United States has regained its lead in world
photovoltaic shipments; the geothermal heat pump industry is striving for 12 percent of the U.S.
space-conditioning market; the bioenergy industry is working to become a major new source of
electric power and transportation fuels (and a major new source of income for U.S. farmers and an
impetus for rural economic development); and hydrogen energy is being developed as a major
energy carrier for the future.<BR>
<P>
One indication of the global potential for renewable energy can be found in recent energy scenarios
developed by the Shell International Petroleum Company. In the "Sustainable Growth" scenario,
emerging renewable technologies progress along their learning curve, first capturing niche markets
and then gradually expanding to become broadly competitive during the early decades of the next
century. In this scenario, renewable energy resources would contribute 20 percent of commercial
worldwide energy by 2020, a contribution that could grow to more than 50 percent in the later part
of the 21st century as technologies mature and diffuse into the marketplace. <BR>
<P>
While such a scenario represents only a possibility-and not a prediction-it does suggest that great
potential exists for renewable energy resources. The primary challenge to expanding the role of
renewable energy resources in the domestic energy portfolio is the need to further reduce costs to
ensure that competitive renewable energy technology is available in expanding domestic and
international energy markets.<BR>
<P>
Programs supporting renewable electric supply will contribute 0.6 quad of primary energy in the
year 2000, saving $4 billion in annual fuel costs and reducing 7 million metric tons of carbon-
equivalent emissions.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.18">Partnering With Industry To Develop Lower Cost Renewable Resource Technologies</H4></a>
The Administration supports fundamental and applied research that helps the renewable industry
develop technologically advanced products. The Department of Energy's renewable energy R&D
programs support fundamental research in areas such as aerodynamics, solid-state physics,
reservoir engineering, combustion processes, and fermentation. Such research has contributed to
major advances in wind energy, photovoltaics, geothermal energy, biomass utilization, and liquid
fuels production. Applied research into thin reflective membrane deposition, airfoil design, and
solar module fabrication has reduced costs and increased productivity from solar thermal power
plants, wind turbines, and flat plate photovoltaic arrays.<BR>
<P>
In addition to renewable electric systems, technology programs are expected to produce nonelectric
energy contributions equivalent to 60 million barrels of imported oil per year in the year 2000 and
twice that amount in 2010. For example, the Department of Energy is advancing the development
of alternative transportation fuels. Through the Biofuels Program, the Department is working with
industry to develop transportation fuels from domestic biomass resources, to displace imports and
enhance rural economic development. The largest research program in this area focuses on
producing ethanol from agricultural and forestry residues, waste paper, and low-value industrial
wastes. The goal of the program is the commercial production of 600 million gallons of biomass
fuels by the year 2000, rising to 16.8 billion gallons by 2020, displacing more than 320 million
barrels of imported oil each year.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Hydrogen Research Program works with industry and a scientific
advisory panel to develop safe, practical, and competitive hydrogen technologies to meet energy
needs. In fiscal year 1996, the program will operate a hydrogen delivery system using metal
hydride storage for mobile applications and scale up a laboratory-sized hydrogen storage and
production plant that will be suitable for export to developing countries in remote areas.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Geothermal Electric RD&D program will reduce the cost of high-
temperature geothermal electricity by 20 percent in the years ahead, and by up to 40 percent for
moderate-temperature resources. It will help U.S. industry expand its domestic generating capacity
to 4,000 megawatts by the year 2000, while capturing 1,000 megawatts annually in international
markets. The movement of technologies into the marketplace requires additional investment in
applied research, development, and deployment of products to facilitate rapid return of embedded
investment costs to the point where industry and markets can take over. <BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Photovoltaic Systems Program supports private sector research to
develop roofing materials and windows that incorporate photovoltaics and can produce electricity.
These efforts are pursued in close collaboration with industry in programs with the Utility PV
Group.</BODY><BR>
