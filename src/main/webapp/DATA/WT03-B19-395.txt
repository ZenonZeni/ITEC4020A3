<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 229</TITLE>

<H1>The economic benefits<BR>
of cutting<BR>
greenhouse gas emissions</H1>
<HR>
<B>The benefits of a policy to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions are the damages 
avoided as a consequence of that policy.</B> Economists define total climate change 
<I>damages</I> as the compensating payment that would be needed to make society as 
well off with climate change as without it. The <I>benefits</I> of a climate change 
policy, however, must be measured against the damages avoided by actions taken now and 
in the future; because <I>past</I> actions are not considered, these benefits will always 
be less than <I>total</I> climate change damages. This distinction is important, and is 
based on the scientific conclusion that the historical build-up of greenhouse gas 
concentrations already commits us to at least some climate change, no matter what 
policies we adopt now.<P>
<B>To properly assess a policy’s benefits, we must recognize that climate change is 
likely to produce gains as well as losses.</B> For example, if temperatures rise, the 
global demand for air conditioning will increase, but the demand for heating will fall. More 
significantly, crop yields are likely to fall in some regions and to increase in others (fact 
sheet 101). When measuring the benefits of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, then, 
the damages avoided must be measured as a net of climate change gains and losses.<P>
<B>Whatever policy is adopted, people will respond to climate change by modifying 
their behaviour to increase gains and reduce losses.</B> People naturally adapt to 
changing conditions. So if climate change reduces the growing season, people will 
substitute early-maturing crops so that output will fall by less than it otherwise would. 
Similarly, if sea-levels rise substantially, the damage will not be the loss of downtown 
Shanghai, but the much lower cost of protecting this area. These natural efforts to adapt 
will reduce climate change losses and increase gains, thus having the effect of lowering the 
benefit of policies to abate greenhouse gas emissions. This effect will be particularly 
important in the long run, as research uncovers new technologies better suited to the 
emerging climate conditions.<P>
<B>Some of the benefits of a climate change policy can be derived from national 
income statistics for climate-sensitive sectors . . .</B>  The economic sector most 
vulnerable to climate change is agriculture (including forestry). This sector accounts for 
only 2% of US GDP but for more than 60% of GDP in Somalia, Uganda, and Nepal. This 
does not necessarily mean that poorer countries will always experience the greatest 
relative losses. For example, climate change could lead to increased rainfall and food 
production in some now-arid countries. Furthermore, developing countries are likely to 
become less dependent on agriculture over time; from 1965-1988, the share of agriculture 
in the output of low-income economies fell from 44% to 33%. That said, poorer countries 
are clearly more vulnerable simply because they are still more dependent on 
climate-sensitive economic activity than are the industrialized countries and they have a 
weaker capability for adapting to negative impacts.<P>
<B>but the value of a decline in the quantity and quality of non-marketed goods 
and services can not be easily measured.</B> GDP data provide only a rough 
indication of a country’s vulnerability to climate change. They do not reflect changes in 
human health, biological diversity, environmental quality, and amenity values. These 
changes can be either positive or negative; for example, although human health may 
worsen in warm countries, it may actually improve in cold ones. Such changes are much 
harder to estimate because the values people place on health and environmental quality are 
not reflected in market prices.<P>
<B>The direct benefits of reducing sea-level rise would be very high for some 
countries but negligible for others.</B> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC - see fact sheet 208) has predicted that there will be a 30-110 centimetre 
rise in sea-level by 2100. One US study suggests that a one-metre rise in sea-levels would 
cost the US about $11 billion annually, or 0.2% of current GDP.1 Relative damages 
would be even greater for island nations and for low-lying countries such as Egypt and 
Bangladesh. One study estimates that the cost of protecting the Maldives from sea-level 
rise would be about 35% of that country’s GNP.2 When considering these figures, it is 
important to remember that they refer to <I>total</I> damages, and not to the (smaller) 
damages that would be prevented by  a new abatement policy.<P>
<B>Because the climate system responds slowly to changes, the benefits of the 
policies we pay for today will not be realized for many years.</B> Costly climate 
change policies would reduce our wealth today but, if they are successful in reducing 
climate change damages, they would increase our wealth in the future. Economists ask: if 
normal economic growth will make people better off in the year 2100 than they are today, 
wouldn’t an extra $1 in consumption be valued less by people living in 2100 than it would 
be by people living today? If so, in order to maximize human well-being across 
generations, the current generation should spend <I>less</I> than $1 today to reduce 
damages by $1 in 2100. In other words, when comparing current costs with future 
benefits, we should <I>discount</I> the latter. Calculating the appropriate rate of 
discount is complicated and depends on ethical concerns as well as empirical facts. The 
important point, however, is this: any discount rate that is chosen greatly reduces the 
benefits that economists would attribute to climate change policies.3<P>
<B>The long-term benefits of abatement policies may be extremely important.</B> 
Most researchers into the benefits of climate change policy assume a doubling of 
greenhouse gas concentrations. However, unless emissions are cut sharply, it is likely that 
atmospheric concentrations will rise by more than this later in the next century. Taking a 
long-term view could potentially produce a much higher calculation of the benefits of 
policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of the long view depends 
on whether the future is discounted and on whether damages are non-linear - that is, 
whether damages double with a two-fold increase in CO2-equivalent concentrations, or 
whether they increase by much more.<P>
