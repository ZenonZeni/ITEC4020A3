<h2>Medicalization of Drug Abuse Control:</h2>

<p><b>Pharmacy Based Voluntary Drug Users Co-operatives</b> </p>

<p><b>A Proposal</b> </p>

<p>Tod H. Mikuriya. M.D. </p>

<hr>

<p>Reinvolve Medicine in Drug Policy<br>
</p>

<p>To bring medicine back to involvement with issues of drug
dependence, the laws need revision to make the treatment of
addicts a medical matter. </p>

<p>Redefine an addict as ill rather than criminal in substantive
terms. </p>

<p>The doctrine of prohibiting physicians from maintaining opiate
and cocaine addicts must be eliminated. Transfer control of
treatment protocols and standards from the Department of Justice
to the Department of Health Services. Mandate development of
maintenance or drug hygiene standards with participation of the
California Medical Association.<br>
</p>

<p>A joint California Medical Association and California Bar
Association committee to draft legislation to revise laws to
optimize freedom to appropriately treat substance abuse,
safeguard patient's rights, and protect the public health.
Safeguards must be included to discourage excessive consumption
or abuse.<br>
</p>

<p>Pharmacy Based Voluntary Drug Users' Co-operatives </p>

<p>A new category of legal non-therapeutic users of controlled
substances is created. Include all drugs listed in the Controlled
Substances Act of 1970 et seq. for actual controlled use. Users
would obtain these drugs at participating pharmacies utilizing
special ID. Entry to the program at the age of majority would be
by written test. No intervention by the program unless there is a
problem. Supported by transaction fees, community treatment
resources would be paid for by the program. <br>
</p>

<p>Success of the program is based on the premise that the rate
of morbidity will be acceptably low in an informed group of
users. Chronic users learn to develop functional stable use
patterns that may continue for long periods without disruption.
Dysfunctional behavior associated with use would result in being
dropped from the program. </p>

<p>Reacting to some adversity a chronic user will increase
his/her dose in an effort to suppress adverse emotions through
distracting analgesia. The consequent psychosocial dysfunction,
health problems, or financial crisis motivates seeking of
treatment or results in external intervention. </p>

<p>Upon entering a detoxification program the habitual user
typically forswears the habit, vowing to stay &quot;clean&quot;
from now on. The rare dependent will truthfully admit to an
authentic treatment goal of reducing a habit to manageable
levels. </p>

<p>Even with success in completing detoxification and maintaining
a period of abstinence, drug dependence is a chronic relapsing
illness. </p>

<p>The mission of VDUC is to control, treat, and prevent drug
abuse in a flexible and appropriate fashion. The dispensing of
controlled substances through participating pharmacies to
registered users is included. </p>

<p>Price structure based upon abuse/use ratio of a substance
would encourage the use of less toxic or dangerous products. A
harmfulness tax is an idea that has been recently proposed by
Grinspoon. </p>

<p>The VDUC would be somewhat more controlled than differential
toxicity tax rates because written and physical tests would be
required for entry into a pharmacy-based program using an
identification card. </p>

<p>Another VDUC goal is to institutionalize connections between
cost/benefit or actuarial facts with social policy and the
marketplace. These connections only dimly exist for alcohol and
tobacco industries and their users. Unlike these hazardous
substances, drugs sold through VDUC would not be granted
exemption from product liability laws. </p>

<p>Transaction fees and all taxes would be earmarked to support
the administration of the co-operative and contracting community
treatment providers for users needing services. <br>
</p>

<p>Different from the British &quot;System&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The contemporary British &quot;system&quot; derives from their
national health service that is represented by local health
councils which manage medical resources. The availability of
physicians who are addiction specialists and priorities of local
councils determines whether the addict will obtain appropriate
treatment. </p>

<p>The rapid increase of heroin addicts and small numbers of
addiction specialists has overwhelmed that system. The illicit
free market filled the drug needs of the users the National
Health Service could not meet. </p>

<p>Substance abuse treatment services in Great Britain are just
as fragmented as that in the United States but with differences
in dynamics of control, economics, and influences of special
interest groups. Both are ill-equipped and overwhelmed by the
impact of problems connected with substance abuse. </p>

<p>But at least they don't turn the addicts into criminals as we
do in the United States.<br>
</p>

<p>Unlike prescriptive medical clinic models the proposed
Voluntary Drug Users Co-operative is not vulnerable to
oversubscription with waiting lists. </p>

<p>Users are dispersed to pharmacies and only come to a treatment
program if there is a problem. </p>

<p>Since the scheme is transaction fee supported, the larger the
number of users, the more money becomes available for treatment,
prevention, and education. </p>

<p>Since there would be no intervention unless there was evidence
of dysfunction, costs would be lower than a clinic or physician
visit type of maintenance program. This lower level of control
and services for problem-free users would support a spectrum of
services for those suffering drug-related illness or dysfunction.
Flexibility and range of response is based on the principle that
control is exerted from within or imposed from without. </p>

<p>More importantly, the program would provide an ongoing source
of reliable data on which to refine policies and develop products
that would optimize use/morbidity patterns.<br>
</p>

<p>Eligibility<br>
</p>

<p>The age of majority would permit the taking of a written test
on drug effects, side effects as well as the conditions of the
VDUC program including consequences of misuse or violation of
conditions. Passing of these tests would constitute informed
consent. </p>

<p>An entry medical evaluation including physical examination and
laboratory tests would be required to screen for conditions that
would preclude or restrict access such as mental illness,
epilepsy, or substance abuse. </p>

<p>These high risk individuals if allowed access would be more
closely supervised by health providers.<br>
</p>

<p>Non-profit community board </p>

<p>A non-profit community board would be mandated to protect the
users from exploitation as well as the public from health and
safety risks. Users, pharmacists, public Health, legal and the
general community should be represented. </p>

<p>Abusers referred to treatment or enforcement </p>

<p>All transactions are reported to the executive office of the
VDUC and any patterns of unusual or exceptional use are
investigated in addition to any reports of medical, surgical, or
antisocial incidents. </p>

<p>Privileges are suspended and the abuser is referred to police
or district attorney if the drugs are furnished to a minor, used
to poison, incapacitate, or impair someone else. Driving while
intoxicated, endangering others, fighting, or being a danger to
others would be generally handled by enforcement.<br>
</p>

<p>If the user exhibits dysfunctional behavior or impaired health
that does not directly harm someone else, then he/she is referred
to an appropriate substance abuse program. Reports from
hospitals, emergency rooms, physicians offices, health
facilities, workplace, family, dispensing pharmacy, or other
source would initiate intervention. The program identification
card would be suspended and the abuser referred to the assessment
team. </p>

<p>Evaluation </p>

<p>Experienced substance abuse specialists would be utilized for
&quot;triage&quot; to determine the type of intervention
appropriate to the individual problem. Intervention would be the
least intrusive or restrictive possible. </p>

<p>Referral for specialized treatment </p>

<p>A spectrum of outpatient and in-patient service would be
available as contractors to the program for intervention in cases
of drug abuse. </p>

<p>Continuing research and education </p>

<p>The continuing study at Framingham, Massachusetts provided us
with definitive information concerning the connection between
smoking, lung cancer, heart, and other circulatory diseases.
Unbiased and extensive morbidity information would be collected
from participating health resources for policy refinement. </p>

<p>In order to restore a source of legitimate and undistorted
medical information as to the connections between drugs and their
hazards, treatments, and prevention, ongoing study is required on
a large scale.<br>
</p>

<p>Funding for Treatment and Prevention </p>

<p>Treatment would be available if needed since the current
salient problem is the lack of money for treatment. Nine out of
ten substance abusers voluntarily asking for treatment are turned
away for lack of a way to pay for treatment. The earmarking of
taxes combined with transaction fees would provide an ongoing
source for funding that has been heretofore lacking.<br>
