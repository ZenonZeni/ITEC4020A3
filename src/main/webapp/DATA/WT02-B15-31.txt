<font face="arial" size="4">Finally!!&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the cursors in one package!!!</font>
</p>

<p class="ind">
<font face="arial" size="3">
Here at last is one file with all six cursors - two joints and four bongs - and in a self-
extracting executable. <a href="download/cursors.exe">Click here</a> to download the 32bit 
self extracting file and <a href="download/cursors.zip">here</a> for a standard zip file. 
When you download one of these you will get both Joint420.ani's and both Dabong!.ani's as 
well as GlassBong.ani and Haze.ani which is like one of those two chambered plastic bongs 
all the head shops sell.  If you have some but not all of these you can also get them 
individually below.

<p><font face="arial" size="4">Some Simple Instructions</font></p>
</center>

<font face="arial" size="3">
<p class="ind">
I get a lot of mail asking  how to make these work and being a Stoner I felt I should 
include some instructions here to save me some work in the long run.  First of all you 
need to be running a 32bit version of the <a href="http://microsoft.com/windows">Windows&reg;</a>
operating system. Animated cursors <strong>will not</strong> run on a Win3.1x machine and the 
same holds true for Macs I believe. So you Win95/NT users just follow these few instructions to
begin using these nifty cursors now.
</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Open you Control Panel
<li>Open the Mouse Applet
<li>Click on the Pointers Tab
<li>Select the cursor you want to replace and click *browse*
<li>Navigate to the directory you unzipped to (usually c:\windows\cursors)
<li>Click *OK* a couple of times and you're set to go
</ul></ul>
<p class="ind">
And so you know, I created the Joint420.ani's with <a href="http://www.impactsoft.com/muangelo/muangelo.html">
Microangelo</a>, the coolest little shareware app for 95.  The animator alone is worth whatever it is they ask 
for it. And if you ever do any cool cursors for Stoners be sure to send em my way!!

<p><font face="arial" size="4">Individual Cursors</font></p>
</center>

<font face="arial" size="3">
<p class="ind">
And finally the collection of Cursors for Stoners as individual files. Most recently I
was sent this new cursor called The Haze, or Haze or something by <a href="mailto:hitman@citynet.net">
Hitman</a>. This cursor is like one of those two stage plastic things that head shops used to 
sell, or still do or whatever - it's been a while since I've been in one of those. Anyway, get it 
as a <a href="download/haze.exe">self extracting executable</a> or a <a href="download/haze.zip">
standard zip file</a>.
</p>

<p class="ind">
The first cursor I was ever sent was Dabong!.  A week later <a href="mailto:cnbdigital@flinet.com">
iZero</a>, a.k.a Image Zero, sent me Dabong2! with a note explaining that he forgot to fill the 
Dabong! with water! And I hadn't even noticed - talk about burnt. Get them both right here as a 
<a href="download/dabong2!.exe">self extractor</a> or a <a href="download/dabong2!.zip">zip</a>.
</p>

<p class="ind">
At some point in the last few months I was happy to get a glass bong in the mail!!  That's always 
cool. And I'm happy to have it for you right here, so it can go on making it's way through the 
mail.  Once again you're welcome to get it as an <a href="download/glassbong.exe">executable</a> 
or <a href="download/glassbong.zip">zip</a>. Send comments <a href="mailto:astrozom@lightspeed.net">
here</a>.
</p>

<p class="ind">
Now for my personal creations. The Joint420 cursors. Standard Disclaimer: I am not an artist 
by any means an artist so don't be surpised or disapointed if these are the worst cursors you've 
ever seen.  If you do happen to like them though, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:scottyo@stoned.org">
tell me</a>.  Grab the <a href="download/joint420.exe">self extracting executable here</a> and the <a href=
download/joint420.zip">standard zip file here</a>.
</p>
