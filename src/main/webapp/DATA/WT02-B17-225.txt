<h3>Superconductivity</h3>
<h2>What can it do for me?</h2>
                               
<h5>Superconductivity is capturing the imagination 
of the world.</h5>
<p>
Transmission lines that carry power without resistance, medical
diagnostic tools that eliminate the need for surgery, "levitating"
trains that speed along the tracks&#151;these are not visions of the
future, but examples of what superconductors are doing today.
<p>
Superconductors conduct electricity without losing energy to
electrical resistance, as most conductors do. Certain materials
become superconductors when they are cooled to very low
temperatures. Low-temperature superconductors exhibit
superconductivity at temperatures near 0 Kelvin (K) (or -273<sup>o</sup> Celsius [C]). Recently discovered high-temperature
superconductors (HTS) can function at temperatures as high as 140 K (-133<sup>o</sup>C). This is an exciting discovery because these high-temperature 
superconductors can be cooled more economically and
efficiently than can low-temperature superconductors.
<p>
Superconductors also repel surrounding magnetic fields. This
phenomenon is demonstrated when we levitate a magnet above a
cooled superconductor, and it is the force at work in Japan's
famous Maglev train.
<p>
Superconductors help us use energy more efficiently and reduce
the cost of electricity production, storage, transmission, and
use, and the costs of transportation and medical equipment. Some current uses,
and some that hold the most promise for the near future, are
these:<p> 
<p>
<dl><dd>
<p><a href="buildform.cgi?fs-1.pdf">Transmission cables</a> that carry current without energy
losses will increase the capacity of the transmission
system, saving money, space, and energy. Prototype
transmission cables are currently being developed by teams
led by Pirelli Cable Company and Southwire Company.
     
<p><a href="buildform.cgi?fs-2.pdf">Motors</a> made with 
superconducting wire will be smaller and
more efficient. A 400-horsepower motor is being developed by
an SPI team led by Reliance Electric Company. 

<p><a href="buildform.cgi?fs-3.pdf">Generators</a> will use 
superconducting wire in place of iron
magnets, making them smaller
and lighter. New generators also may get more power from
less fuel. An SPI team led by General Electric is developing
a 100-megavolt-ampere generator.

<p><a href="buildform.cgi?fs-4.pdf">Fault-current limiters</a> help 
utilities deliver reliable
power to their customers. HTS fault-current limiters detect abnormally high current
in the utility grid (caused by lightning strikes or downed
utility poles, for example). They then reduce the fault
current so the system equipment can handle it. An SPI team
led by Lockheed Martin  recently produced a successful HTS
fault-current limiter that will soon be ready to market.    

<p><b>Energy storage </b>in both 
flywheels and superconducting magnetic energy storage 
systems will ensure the quality and
reliability of the power transmitted to utility customers.
In addition, energy storage provides utilities with cost
savings by allowing them to store energy when the demand for
electricity is low and generating the power is cheap.
This stored energy is then dispensed when demand is high and
power production is more expensive.
     
<p><b>Cellular phone base 
stations </b>will use HTS filters. Some
people predict that this will be one of the most significant
early markets for HTS.
     
<p><b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines </b>enhance medical
diagnostics by imaging internal organs&#151;often eliminating
the need for invasive surgeries. MRIs, which currently are made with low-temperature superconductors, will be smaller and less expensive when made with HTS.
     
<p><b>Maglev trains </b>seem to float on air as a result of using
superconducting magnets. These trains have been under
development in Japan for two decades; the newest prototype
may exceed 547 kilometers (340 miles) per hour.
     
</dl></dd>
<p>
<p>
These are only a few of the many possible uses for
superconductors. Research and development of HTS may still yield
many more uses for materials that can carry electricity without
resistance. And as today's new technologies move into the
marketplace, they will have a great effect on the way we generate, 
deliver, and use electricity, and on the medical and transportation
technologies of tomorrow.
