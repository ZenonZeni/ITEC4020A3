<B>Outline of systems for promotion of orphan drug development:</B><P>

<I><B>The roles of the Drug Organization;</B></I><P>

<I>Granting;</I><BR>
The Drug Organization (The organization for Drug ADR relief, R&D promotion and Product review) makes grants to be used for the R&D of the said medicines and devices to private companies that have been disignated by The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) as manufacturers or importers of ORPHAN DRUGS. The R&D cost subject to the granting is the direct one for the R&D and the amounts of grants are limited to one half of the cost. At the time of application for subsidies, each private company is required to submit an outline of R&D, cost, schedules for the R&D activities and other information. The Drug Organization makes grants after surveying these data. The manufacturers or importers of ORPHAN DRUGS to whom the grants are given will pay a part of their proceeds or profits (if exceed 100 million yen) after ORPHAN DRUGS are launched into the market (the total amount of payment is limited to that of the grant).<P>

<I>Guidance and Advice;</I><BR>
In order to accelerate R&D of medicines and devices designated ORPHAN DRUGS, the Drug Organization provides guidance and advice for both of the R&D procedures of ORPHAN DRUGS and the preparation of New Drug Approval (NDA) in cooperation with the MHW.<P>

<I>Authorization for Tax Deduction;</I><BR>
Based on the Special Taxation Measures Law, the Drug Organization authorizes the development costs of ORPHAN DRUGS that will be required for the period subjected to the grant, responding to the application from each company. Once authorized, six percent of their ORPHAN DRUGS R&D costs exclusive of the amount of grants given by the Drug Organization is deducted from their tax. The tax deduction is limited to 10% of the corporation tax or the income tax for the term.<P>

<I>Additional preferential measures for orphan drugs;</I><P>

In addition to the supports for development promotion by the Drug Organization, ORPHAN DRUGS can receive following preferential measures from the MHW.<P>

1. Priority in the Examination for New Drug approvals;<BR>
ORPHAN DRUGS are given the highest priority in the examination for New Drug Approvals.<BR>
2. Extension of the Term for Re-examination;<BR>
The terms for re-examination of ORPHAN DRUGS are extended to the maximum of 10 years, compared with 6 years of ordinary new drugs.<P>  

<B>Outline of Japanese Pharmacopoeia:</B><P>

The Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) provides, based on Article 41 of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, authoritative standards, specifications and testing methods for drugs.<BR>
Since it was first published in June 1886, it has been continuously revised in accordance with progress in pharmaceutical development and advances and improvements in science and technology.<P>

The JP consists of Part I and Part II, and includes basic drugs which are important for health care with respect to necessity and frequency of use.<BR>
Part I:  widely used pharmaceutical raw materials,
            widely used basic preparations, and
            drugs which are not widely used but are essential for health care.<BR>
Part II: combination drugs,
            drugs produced from natural substances, 
            basic substances required for manufacturing formulated preparations, and
            sanitary and surgical materials, etc.<P>

The Pharmaceutical Affairs Law specifies that the JP shoul undergo general revision at least every 10 years. Since the 9th revised JP appeared in April 1976, it has been revised every 5 years. in the current 12th edition of the JP, Part I contains 750 items, and Part II, 471 items.<P>

Japanese Pharmacopoeia Drug Information (JP-DI), which was published in 1991, contains information on the clinical use of drugs listed in the JP.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
