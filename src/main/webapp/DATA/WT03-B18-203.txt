<H2>Poloidal Ion Flow Modification and Reduction of Radial Particle Transport in PISCES-A</H2>

<P>

<P>Increases in the sheared 
edge electric field and poloidal ion flow have been observed
to coincide with the L to H transition and the formation of a radial transport
barrier in tokamaks. Experiments in the
PISCES-A linear reflex arc discharge device
study the effect of the radial electric field on the plasma turbulence and the
fluctuation-induced radial particle transport. 
When the electric field layer width is on the
order of the ion Larmor radius (l_E \approx 1-2 \rho_i), the poloidal
ion flow induced by the electric field profile is significantly modified
from the E \times B drift speed. Under these conditions, 
the poloidal ion rotation increases as the electric field layer width 
increases. A radial transport barrier forms if the magnitude of the 
poloidal ion rotation is substantially increased by widening the electric 
field layer.
Modeling of the poloidal ion flow profile is consistent with the experimental
measurement of the phase velocity of coherent structures.
 Detailed, two-dimensional
measurements of the spatial size and radial and poloidal propagation of
coherent structures observed in the plasma will also be presented.
