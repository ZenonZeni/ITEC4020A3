The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is distinguished not only
for pioneering the first graduate degree program in Chinese Medicine in the United 
States, but also for sponsorship of scholarly activities.  Since 1981, the College has 
published the Journal of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, one 
of the oldest English language journals in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.  
The  Journal  was  created  to encourage  research  and  translation  by  American 
practitioners of Chinese medicine.   At  this  time,  publication of  the  journal  is
temporarily suspended.
<P>
In 1985, the College joined with the Botanical Garden, University of California, Berkeley, 
to cosponsor, with the Guangzhou College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a collection 
of Chinese medicinal plants.
