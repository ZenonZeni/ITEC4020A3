<TITLE>Medical treatment of obesity</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P><B>Successful medical treatment for obesity has been
discovered.</B>
<P>Recently there have been some major scientific breakthroughs
in the treatment of obesity. Treatment is desperately needed as obesity increases
ones risk of many other diseases. Everyone is familiar with these, they include
diabetes mellitus, heart disease, gout, osteoarthyritis, gallbladder disease,
and even cancer. Obese people do not live as long as non obese people. Obesity
also takes a great toll on a person's self esteem.
<P>No one wants to be obese, but most who are can not seem to do anything
about it. Obesity has been considered to be a personal weakness, but we now
have evidence that it is a medical illness. It is gneetic and probably can
not be cured. Most people last only two weeks or less on a diet. Even the
successful dieters almost alwaysgain their weight back within a short time.
The hypothalamus of the brain and other structures in the brain work to maintain
your weight, sometimes called the "set point". This yo-yo effect is probably
worse than no weight loss at all. It probably leads to an increased percentage
of fat in the body. Fat is less metabolically active and this leads to even
more weight gain. With each successive cycle, weight is regained faster and
weight loss takes longer.
<P>This sounds discouraging but there is good news. Obesity can be treated
like other chronic medical illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension. It
requires chronic treatment. I believe obesity is caused by a chemical imbalance
in the brain that is inharited or results from the mutation of one or more
genes. Scientists have discovered an obesity gene in humane chromosomes.
It leads to food cravings and an underactive metabolism. The more the cravings
are resisted, the stronger they become.
<P>The new treatment starts with correcting the chemical imbalances. We now
have drugs that increase brain levels of serotonin and dopamine. These seem
to be a major factor in this disease. With these medications, food obsessions
disappear and you can feel full throughout the day and be more analytical
about your eating. Having corrected the chemical imbalance, food cravings
and slow metabolism are corrected, and a healthy diet can be followed.
<P>Two of the drugs available now are phentermine and fenfluramine. They
both affect the brains neurotransmitters. Phentermine enhances dopamine and
norepinephrine. This causes people to eat faster but eat less. Fenfluramine
acts on seratonin and plays a large role in reducing the feelings or agitation
and deprivation that are associated with hunger. Serotonin also controls
how much we eat, and the body's desire for protein and carbohydrates. The
medication will not let you overeat. You can lose weight without doing anything.
It will all come naturally as a result of normalizing your body chemistry.
<P>Simple behavior modification can then be implemented such as not buying
high calorie and high fat foods, not eating out at fast food restaurants,
eating slower, off a smaller plate, with smaller utensils. Drinking more
water during the day. Only eating in one place in the house, etc.
<P>Exercise is, of course, also important. Activity can be increased even
if you do not have a lot of extra time to go to the gym. You can use the
stairs instead of the elevator, walk instead of driving when possible, etc.
If you have some extra tome, then do something you enjoy to exercise your
muscles, like walking, dancing, bike riding, etc.
<P>The key is that the treatment must be long term, probably life long. If
the medication is stopped, the chemical imbalance will return and so will
the food cravings. It is just as if you stop your blood pressure medicine,
you blood pressure will again become elevated. The new medications are not
habit forming and work over the long term. This is much different from the
old appetite suppressants.
<P>In our office we have been treating patients with this new method very
successfully. It will require an initial orientation that lasts about an
hour and once monthly office visits for monitoring and fine tuning the program
and for prescription refills. The cost is only $50 per month for this service,
plus the cost of the medication.
