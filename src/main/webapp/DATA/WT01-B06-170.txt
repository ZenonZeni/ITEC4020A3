<h2>Healing Modern Diseases with the Gerson Therapy</h2>



<p><b>Chronic Fatigue, Candidiasis, Herpes, Lyme Disease, Salmonella, Legionnaire's Disease, AIDS</b>



<p>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute

<p><IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">

<p>These days, we hear the names of many diseases that were totally

unfamiliar or actually unknown some ten or twenty years ago.  I refer to

them as "modern diseases".  Some, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),

are also known as "Yuppy Diseases", after Young Upwardly-mobile

Professionals, those most commonly affected.  The victims of these

diseases are most often middle-class whites, two thirds of them women.  



<h3>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3>



<p>The volume Health Conditions, p. 616, describes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

as "a mysterious infectious illness" that supposedly existed and was

described in the past as "the vapors", and, after World War I, as

"soldier's heart".  Researchers have failed to find a single cause, but

suspect it to be related to the Epstein-Barr virus infection, with

candidiasis and herpes thrown in.  It is almost certainly caused by

infectious agents, whether one or more is relatively immaterial when we

treat it with the Gerson Therapy.  According to Dr. Murray R.  Susser of

Santa Monica, California, symptoms can include deep fatigue, joint pain or

weakness, headache, memory loss, mental confusion, digestive problems,

allergies and depression.  These can also include anxiety, night sweats

and even irregular heartbeat.  



<p>A young man (age 28) seen at the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> had all of these problems

so severely that he had been bedfast for many months, unable to engage in

any activity.  The doctors accused him of laziness and/or psychiatric

problems and put him into the psychiatric ward.  Drugs administered there

worsened his depression so badly he became suicidal.  At the <a href="center.html">hospital</a>,
 with the intensive Gerson Therapy and detoxification, he was up

in a little more than a week, in great good spirits and dancing with his

mother!  In The Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9 No. 4, (Nov./Dec.

1994), we described another chronic fatigue patient who recovered

completely on the Gerson Therapy.  He had suffered from almost all of the

above described symptoms.  



<p>Health Conditions further quotes Dr. Susser, saying that he firmly

believes that CFS results from "several ongoing, simultaneous infections

that weaken the immune system."  I believe that it is probably the other

way around: it is a weakened immune system (due to previous infections,

antibiotic and other drug treatments, toxicity from foods and the

environment) that allows various organisms to take up residence in the

body.  Once these have damaged the body, it is much easier for other

opportunistic viruses or germs to add to the problem.



<p>Dr. Susser adds that in CFS "we often get hidden, concomitant parasite,

yeast and viral infections that are the result of a weakened immune

system."  



<p>Here is our cue that CFS is not a simple problem but a combination of

immune deficiency diseases, including candida and possible parasites.



<h3>Candidiasis</h3>



<p>Candidiasis, a fungal invasion, has become extremely common. Candida is

commonly found in many body areas, particularly in the gut and vagina.

Candidiasis regularly develops in people who have undergone severe or

long-term treatments with antibiotics.  The mechanism is quite simple:

since candida commonly inhabits the colon, it shares the available

nutrients with friendly bacteria as well as other organisms.  When

patients are treated with antibiotics, these bacteria are killed off - but

the yeast (Candida) survives and is now no longer deprived of nutrients by

other organisms, it has the area and the nutrients to itself.  It is

important to note that patients who receive antibiotic treatments are

already suffering from some infection and are therefore immune

compromised.  The weakened immune system is then subject to a massive

invasion by candida that was unaffected by antibiotics and against which

the body has no defenses.  



<p>Candida really becomes a problem when it invades other tissues,

particularly the nervous system.  The drugs available for treatment, like

all drugs, are often temporarily effective to control the candida - but

they do not heal.  On the contrary, all drugs are toxic and further damage

and weaken the immune system.  The result is that the candida recurs if

and when the drugs have to be discontinued due to toxic liver damage.  



<p>Since cancer chemotherapy also severely damages the immune system,

virtually all cancer patients who were treated with chemo also suffer from

candidiasis.  Furthermore, even those who have not been treated with

cytotoxic (chemo) drugs suffer from a damaged immune system: they could

not have cancer if their immune system were fully functioning.  We can

therefore assume that they, too, have some degree of candida infection.



<h3>Herpes</h3>



<p>Herpes, or fever sores, have been around for a long time.  Genital herpes,

on the other hand, is a relatively new sexually transmitted disease (STD).

Before the advent of AIDS, it was one of the more serious genitally

transmitted diseases and caused much distress in young people. It, too,

defies treatment Herpes simplex is described as an acute viral infection;

while genital herpes is known to be caused by Herpes Virus 2.  This, too,

is clearly an immune deficiency disease and has been overcome by the

Gerson Therapy.



<p>Another form of Herpes, Herpes Zoster or shingles, is also on the rise.

Not only does it cause extreme pain which is difficult to control, but it

generally does not go away.  The severity of the attack will subside, but

constant and recurring problems, including pain, may persist.  There is no

really effective treatment to overcome and cure this herpes infection

except with the intensive Gerson Therapy.



<h3>Lyme Disease</h3>



<p>Lyme Disease was first observed and described in Lyme, Connecticut.  It

seems to be caused by an infectious agent, transmitted by a tick, and

causes various problems, including in some cases arthritis, erythema

(reddening of skin), Bell's palsy, brain and possible heart abnormalities.

It has been improved by the administration of penicillin, however many

cases persist and develop into serious paralyses, nerve and brain

disorders.  We have seen only one patient who suffered from this problem.

She was in a wheelchair, unable to move or control her limbs, was severely

depressed and her condition was deteriorating.  In only a few days on the

Gerson Therapy her overall problems improved considerably.  I have no

follow-up in this case and am unable to report further progress.



<h3>Salmonella</h3>



<p>This is a topic that has to be treated separately, and is not really a

"modern" disease.  It has several forms ranging from mild to severe

gastro-intestinal inflammation all the way to serious food poisoning.

Other species of salmonella are the causative agents of paratyphoid and

typhoid fever. 



<p>The reason salmonella must be included under "modern" infections is that

in its food poisoning action, it is now killing an increasingly large

number of people in the U.S. annually.  The number of salmonella cases

reported in Los Angeles last year, for instance, increased ten times (from

just over 100, to just over 1,000) over the previous year.



<p>The culprit, to a large extent, is the chicken industry.  We talked about

"The Case Against Chicken" in the Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9, No.

1, (May/June 1994), but this discussion did not include any of the many

infectious agents found in chicken due to current automated, high-volume,

profit-oriented processing.  Surely many of our readers saw the article in

Time Magazine (Oct. 17, 1994) titled "Something Smells Fowl", and

describing the horrendous and unsanitary conditions found in today's

chicken processing plants.  Aside from salmonella, chicken are generally

infected with Camphylobacter, E.  coli or other micro-organisms, according

to the Time article. "Each year at least 6.5 million and possibly as many

as 80 million people get sick from chicken, and some 1,000 people die,

according to conservative estimates".  Although cooking the meat properly

will generally kill the infectious bacteria, any kitchen surface or

implement that the infected meat touches can also become contaminated and

potentially dangerous.



<p>In discussing the damage done by consuming chicken, neither our own

May/June issue, nor the Time Magazine article touched on the treatment of

the animals while they are alive.  The incubated eggs are injected before

they hatch, since they would otherwise not even produce live chicks.

Chickens are heavily treated with hormones and antibiotics to keep them

alive - and they must generally be slaughtered at a very early age (for

chickens) - or they die of disease.  Yet, with intensive advertising, the

immense (7 billion chickens are slaughtered in the United States annually)

and profitable chicken industry has convinced much of the American public

that eating this septic, decaying, sick and chemical-laced meat is

healthier and preferable to eating red meat because of its lower fat and

cholesterol content.  I am by no means advocating the consumption of red

meat, pork or veal - none of which are the slightest bit healthful.  I am

instead pointing out that eating chicken is not a reasonable choice for a

person wishing to maintain good health.



<p>The above material is presented to give the reader background information

on the increasing dangers of "modern" sources of infection.  But, in my

opinion, all these modern diseases are really only symptoms of the

seriously decreased resistance and damaged immune systems of our current

population.  In all these cases, infections are involved, and in many of

them (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Candidiasis, Genital Herpes, Lyme

Disease), there is no cure by drugs or other orthodox methods.  Yet the

Gerson Therapy has been shown to help people overcome these diseases.

This shows that the Gerson Therapy strengthens and restores the immune

system and thus helps the body to overcome these "incurable" ailments.



<h3>Legionnaires' Disease</h3>



<p>Among "modern diseases," Legionnaire's Disease should also be mentioned,

especially in connection with impaired immune systems.  This "mysterious

new disease" was first described in a number of cases which afflicted

members of the American Legion who were attending a convention in

Philadelphia in 1976.  The disease is a serious type of pneumonia, yet is

often carried without producing disease.  According to the text Current

Medical Diagnosis, Legionnaires' Disease is caused by an opportunistic

germ (meaning that it attacks weakened or defenseless persons) and

generally affects the elderly, smokers and people on dialysis or who have

been given organ transplants.  The latter, of course, must be treated with

immune suppressant agents or their bodies would reject the transplants.

In other words, their immune systems are severely and intentionally

depressed, and they become susceptible to opportunistic infections.



<h3>AIDS</h3>



<p>No discussion of "modern diseases" would be complete without mentioning

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.  This, as the name

indicates, is the ultimate failure of the immune system.  It stands to

reason, then, that since the Gerson Therapy restores the immune system, it

could well overcome this problem, too.  At present, it is difficult for me

to claim that the Gerson Therapy will cure AIDS.  Due to restrictions

imposed by the Mexican health authorities, we are not allowed to accept

AIDS patients.  As a result, we have not been able to follow AIDS patients

to observe results.  We have seen good recoveries in two cases of patients

who were treated for HIV infections on an out-patient basis.  I feel

uncomfortable making any curative claims for the Gerson Therapy on the

basis of such a small sample.  Yet, one cannot help but assume that, with

the improved immune response produced by the Gerson Therapy as with so

many other diseases, AIDS should respond very well.



<p>Dr. Gerson was aware very early in his career that his Therapy was able to

improve and restore the immune system - since he was able to cure

tuberculosis of all types well before the advent of antibiotics.  I even

remember a case of infantile paralysis in New York that was reversed

almost immediately with the Gerson Therapy.  Obviously the immune system

plays an extremely important role in the treatment of cancer.  The

restored immune response is largely credited with helping the body break

down and dissolve tumor tissue.  Conversely, since all the above diseases

are on the rise, we also have to understand that, due to modern

agricultural methods, food processing methods, damage to our bodies with

toxins, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, with medical drug treatments, etc., our

immune systems are more and more seriously damaged or paralyzed.  In order

to heal anything we have to work to restore the whole body, and with it,

the immune system.  And since the Gerson Therapy does just that, it has

been able to heal both 'ancient' and 'modern' diseases.
