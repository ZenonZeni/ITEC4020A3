<H3>Preventive Discipline: A Home/School Behavior Management Strategy That
Works </H3>

<P><B>Richard D. Lavoie</B>, M.A., M.Ed., Executive Director, Riverview
School, Cape Cod, MA </P>

<P>It has long been accepted that children with Learning Disabilities are
“environmentally dependent”. That is, they respond directly and intensively
to the environment in which they find themselves and thus take their social/behavioral
cues from their surroundings. Therefore, the key to managing the behavior
of these children may lie in changing the environment, not the child! This
workshop will discuss and demonstrate a Behavior Management program that
enables parents and teachers to create a learning environment that provides
the structure, support and predictability that allows and encourages kids
to behave appropriately. Dozens of specific strategies will be presented.

from being passive, stressful bystanders to active, relaxed and productive
facilitators. </P>
