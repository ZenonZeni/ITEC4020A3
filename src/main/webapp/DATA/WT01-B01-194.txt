<p><b>Sandy Conklin, CST, Craven Regional Center, New Bern, North Carolina</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><i>&quot;I just love it! Not only does it hold the camera steady and mount easily onto the bed, but the cost 
is less than a CST salary. It improves the operating room environment by helping to free up 
hands.&quot;<br>
</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Blanca Elder, RN, Clinical Laser Nurse, Providence Memorial Hospital, El Paso, Texas.</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><i>&quot;I value the AESOP robot because it increases staff productivity by eliminating the need for a 
camera holding person. I think we all appreciate the stable video image it maintains.&quot; <br>
</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bob Harding, RN, Director of Surgical Services, San Ramon Regional Medical Center, San Ramon, 
California.</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><i>&quot;I anticipate operating a more cost-efficient department with the AESOP. Rather than eliminating 
full-time employees (FTE's) from the surgical staff, I plan to have my staff focus their attention on 
other tasks. Based on our current caseload, I estimate the AESOP will save at least 50 hours of 
nursing care a month on endoscopic cases.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such cost savings and efficiencies are particularly important issues in the face of healthcare 
reform. I think we're in a situation with managed care and per-diem rates and capitation that 
we're going to have to do everything possible to decrease costs on a per-case basis. I think one of 
the things that will be affected by this is that more and more cases are going to be done without 
assistant surgeons because they're no longer going to be paid. <br>
<br>
&quot;I expect it to fall to me to supply a staff member to hold the laparoscope and assist the surgeon, 
or to find an alternative method of doing that. For me, the AESOP is the logical alternative. It's 
going to be beneficial to the physician because he's going to be able to control it. It's going to be 
steady. He can go forward. He can pan the entire abdomen. He can go in for a close shot. He can 
try a different angle, and he's always got his landmarks because of the memory.&quot;</i> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sue Sherman, RN, Director of Surgical Services, Valley Community Hospital, Santa Maria, 
California.<br>
</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>&quot;For me the primary benefit of AESOP is that is frees up the camera holder to do other jobs 
during procedures such as the lap chole, which is a very labor intensive procedure. It is also 
beneficial in that it is preparing surgeons and staff to utilize computer assistance for solo-surgery 
at a time when a first-rate physician will no longer be available. Further it is an excellent PR tool. 
We can market our facility as having &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; equipment. This heightens public 
perception of our organization.&quot; <br>
</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Kay Stansell, RN, Endoscopy Charge Nurse, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><i>&quot;We find AESOP to be a marvelous staffing solution for camera holding during endoscopy. It 
solved another related problem for us by eliminating multiple staff complaints regarding carpal 
tunnel syndrome, neck and shoulder pain related to camera holding. Additionally, it eliminates 
overtime payments for late procedures.&quot;</i> <br>
</li>
</ul>
