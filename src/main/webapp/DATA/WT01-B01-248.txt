<I><B>I was on watch as Navigator today.  I was pleasantly suprised
how well everything went: the sunsight was confirmed by LORAN
C, and the dead reckoning plot was right on the money.—Lisa

<I><B>Port au Prince (Haiti) is great! They are having a two-day Carnival with
a parade and everything. There are bands on trucks followed by
girls in costumes throwing candy. People dance in the streets
and it is so noisy and amazing.—Cindy

<I><B>Today I was Junior Watch Officer.  I was responsible for getting
all the sails up, (Main, Fisherman, Jib and Jib Topsail).  My
watchmates were terrific.  It's wonderful to witness the physical
and moral support we have learned to give each other.—Marion

<B><I>November 26 1991, St. Thomas harbor:—I am writing 
this on the port bow of the <I/>Westward<I> on a beautiful
and peaceful tropical night in the Carribean. Anchored just offshore,
I am looking at the lights of the city of St. Thomas sprinkled
across the countryside. St. Thomas is much more attractive by
night. As I write, a cruise ship is pulling out of the harbor.
It looks like a piece of the city that decided to break loose
and sail away.—Reid

<I><B>I'm finding the lab work much more interesting than I expected.
 The first time I use the unfamiliar equipment (setting net tows,
operating the winch,  running titrations, BT slide, Nansen Bottles,
etc.) I worry that I'll screw up and break something or ruin a
measurement.  I find that the second time I am much more relaxed
and the work goes better.  I think I learn especially well when
I have to show someone else how to use the equipment.—Marion

<I><B>On the 13th I got my sea legs. What a terrific day! I felt so
liberated from the queasies that plagued me. We sailed into a
pod of 50-60 minke whales and I climbed the ratlines and watched
from above. The whales banked and rolled under the <I/>Westward<I> as
they surfed under the swells. At first they appeared as black
and bright aqua objects, then they surfaced and their white flippers
broke the water. Each approaching group of whales brought a crazed
cheer of whoops and squeals as everyone scurried about for a better
vantage point.—Dan

<I><B>We came into Jamaica yesterday morning and anchored off Port Royal.
Jamaica is mountainous and more lush than Haiti. Port Royal is
a laid-back town that sank in an earthquake in 1692. We lounged
around all day rust-busting and dancing to Jamaican music.—Cindy

<I><B>I'm thrilled that I seem to have conquered my fear of heights.
 I've had whale watch up in the rigging three times now and it
seems that having a purpose in going aloft makes all the difference.
 It was quite windy and exciting up there.  We changed tacks while
I was standing on the speaders so that, when it was time to come
down, I had to step out on the yardarm, climb around the foremast
and come down  the ratlines on the new windward tack.  No problem,
just a series of single steps.  Two months ago I wouldn't have
believed that I could do it.—Marion

<I><B>Puerto Plata is the type of place you find in a late night movie
with Humphrey Bogart sitting in the bar beneath the large, slowly
rotating ceiling fan. A steamy jungle and a lively hispanic town
complete the rest of the scene.—Dan
