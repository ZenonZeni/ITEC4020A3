<B>Hodgson Announces Conservation Tax Improvements
</B>
</CENTER><P>
"Tax reforms that promote the environmental stewardship of private forest land and conservation lands will be permanently worked into the property-tax process," Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today.<P>

"These changes fulfil our promise to improve the property-tax system to promote better management of private woodlands and the protection of Ontario's natural heritage," said Hodgson.  "Property taxes will be reformed so that there is a long-term commitment to support landowners who protect and conserve their woodlands and significant natural heritage areas."<P>

"These reforms will lead to better stewardship of Ontario's forests, which the international marketplace demands," said Hodgson.  "Through these reforms, Ontario can keep its markets open, which is good for the economy and creating jobs."<P>

These measures follow Hodgson's announcement last year of the reinstatement of the Managed Forest Tax Rebate, an interim measure that was first created in 1975 but terminated in 1993 by the former NDP government, which had other spending priorities.<P>

The changes today are part of the government's response to the tax recommendations of the Who Does What committee.  The changes are consistent with both the government's commitment to replace interim property-tax rebates with long-term tax reforms that recognize the importance of environmental protection and the proposals contained in the report of the Mike Harris Task Force on Rural Economic Development.  The changes will go into effect in the 1998 tax year.<P>

Under the changes, the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program and the Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program will be replaced by a system that reduces the tax rate on eligible lands through the regular property-tax process. These changes will also reduce the tax assessment on most of these lands.<P>

The tax rate for eligible managed forest land will be set at 25 per cent of the local residential tax rate while there will be no tax on eligible conservation lands.  Landowners will need to apply to have eligible land covered by the changes, and management plans will still be required for managed forests.  The minimum size of eligible land is four hectares (about 10 acres) for forests and 0.2 hectares (about half an acre) for conservation lands.  The elimination of the rebate programs also means the elimination of any rebate cap. <P> 

Rick Monzon, Executive Director of the Ontario Forestry Association, called the changes "Terrific.  I like the idea of reducing the acreage and I am happy that the rebate is being replaced by a more realistic assessment and mill rate."<P>

Lynn McIntyre, Secretary of the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators Association, said that the association agrees with the government move. 
"We view this as a positive step in sustaining private land forestry in Ontario."<P>

Protection of private woodlands benefits snowmobile clubs.  Landowners who have participated in the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program are 
often more receptive to allowing recreational access to private woodlots.<P>

"The Province of Ontario has been a big partner in the development of snowmobiling in Ontario," said Tim West, Manager of External Relations for the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs.  "Any changes that have a positive impact on landowners are also a big plus for us."<P>

This tax change for managed forest and conservation lands will also apply to eligible lands owned by Conservation Authorities, which are ineligible under the existing rebate programs.<P>

"These changes will reduce red tape for private landowners and may affect tax revenues for some municipalities," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The government is working to address any impact the changes have."<P>

Mr Hodgson also indicated that there would be no effect on the existing provincial funding program for the operation and maintenance of flood control works.<P>
