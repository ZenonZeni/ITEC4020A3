<p>The acronym SCARA stands for Selective Compliance Assembly
Robot Arm, a particular design developed in the late 1970s in the
laboratory of Professor Hiroshi Makino of Yamanashi University,
located in Kofu, Japan. The basic configuration of a SCARA is a
four degree-of-freedom robot with horizontal positioning
accomplished by a combined Theta 1 and Theta 2 motion, much like
a shoulder and elbow held perfectly parallel to the ground. The
combination of Theta 1 and Theta 2 form the defining structure of
the SCARA. The two linked arms comply slightly in the horizontal,
but remain rigid in the vertical. Thus the most basic assembly
task of putting a peg into a hole is now much easier as the SCARA
will comply slightly from side-to-side, but it will not typically
tilt or jam the peg in at an angle.</p>

<p>At the end of the Theta 1 and Theta 2 linked arms is the
Z-axis, which provides a powerful down and up motion, vertical to
the X-Y plane (the table top). In conjunction with the Z is the
Roll axis, which orients the end-of-arm to the workpiece.
Typically a gripping mechanism or other tool is attached to the
end of the Z-axis and it can be raised or lowered, rotated
clockwise or counter clockwise, or positioned quickly anywhere
within the defined X-Y workspace.</p>

<p>SCARAs are know for their fast cycle times, excellent
repeatability, good payload capacity and a large workspace,
shaped somewhat like a donut. SCARAs also feature sophisticated
motion control with full programmability. With its torso-based,
one arm design, the SCARA integrates easily into most
applications.</p>

<p>For flexible, high speed parts assembly and handling, consider
a SCARA, one of the most useful and flexible automation tools
available.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs - The Perfect
Combination!</font></h2>

<p>As one of the first manufacturers of SCARA robots in 1981,
Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs have been performing precisely and reliably
ever since, including more than 3,500 sold through an OEM
relationship with IBM Corporation. Now with its seventh
generation, the SR84xx Series, Sankyo is proud of the many
outstanding features its SCARA have to offer today:</p>

    <li>Sankyo SCARAs, for today&#146;s manufacturing and into
        the future. . . <h3><font color="#0000FF">A Family of
        SCARAs . . .</font></h3>
        <p>Thousands of Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs have been used in a
        wide variety of manufacturing environments since 1981,
        some of which require special features of robot design.
        Based on this collective experience, Sankyo is proud to
        offer four different versions of its SR84xx SCARA Series,
        each version customized to perform reliably in a
        particular environment.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Industrial:</i></b></font>
        Sankyo&#146;s base SCARA design is for typical industrial
        environments with an operating temperature of 0 to 40
        degrees C, a relative humidty from 8 to 80%, and a
        general environment conducive to workers without any
        special protective garb. Sankyo SR84xx SCARAs have
        performed flawlessly in these types of environments, 24
        hours per day, seven days per week, year in and year out.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Cleanroom:</i></b> </font>For
        cleanroom, the SR8437C and SR8438C Class 10 (0.30 µm
        particle size) SCARA versions are available. The Class 10
        SCARAs incorporate special seals, finishing, paint,
        grease, screws and require a vacuum source to evacuate
        the particulates captured inside the arm. These systems
        have been well-proven in the disk-drive industry.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Dust Proof:</i></b></font>
        For environments with heavier particulates, the SR8437DP
        and SR8438DP versions are available. These dust-proof
        SCARAs incorporate special seals and covers, a Z-axis
        bellows, and light positive air pressure to keep the
        particulates out of the interior of the arm. These
        dust-proof systems meet the International
        Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Index of Protection
        rating of IP5x.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Splash Proof:</i></b> </font>For
        environments consisting of splashing water or cutting
        fluids, the SR8547WP and SR8438WP versions are available.
        The spalsh-proof SCARAs incorporate special seals and
        covers and a Z-axis bellows. Many Sankyo splash-proof
        SCARAs have been incorporated into Sankyo-built machining
        centers and transfer lines with cutting fluids splashing
        freely. These splash-proof SCARAs meet IEC&#146;s Index
        of Protection rating of Ipx4.</p>
        <h3><font color="#0000FF">Customization</font></h3>
        <p>A variety of other options, versions and features for
        Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs have been developed over the years
        and Sankyo is pleased to make these available as
        conditions require. This list includes longer versions of
        the basic SR84xx SCARAs, such as the SR8437 with a 1000
        mm reach; longer Z-heads &#150; up to 550 mm for the
        SR8437 and up to 250 mm for the SR8438; slide-type Z-axes
        for mounting various types of screw and nut drivers;
        side-mounted cable interfaces for tighter integration
        into the workspace; and special paint colors to match
        specific system designs. Other variations will also be
        considered on a case by case basis. </p>
