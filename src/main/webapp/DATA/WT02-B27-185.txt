<P><B>I am in two minds about "Advance Directives"</B> or
"Living Wills" as they are called. It seems to me that these could be
difficult to enforce even if fully supported by Act of Parliament
because in the event of an accident or sudden illness occurring away
from home or if unaccompanied by someone who knows your wishes,
the last thing anyone arriving at the scene would think of is: does
this person wish to be revived or not? I believe that the first thing
anyone would do, instinctively, would be to to whatever they could to
preserve life at all costs!
<P><B> - Jean Randall</B>
<P><i>(The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society supplies its members with a
wallet to hold the living will and encourages them to carry it on their person,
together with an "alert card" that fits in the wallet or purse. Decisions about
whether to continue, or instigate life-sustaining treatment are often made
once a patient has been stabilised as far as possible, and by this time the
belongings may have been examined and the presence of a living will
discovered, or so one hopes... - Ed.)</i>

<P><B>I have worked as a Staff Nurse</B> for many years
and it never ceases to amaze me the pain and suffering people are
made to endure in the name of "humanity." I have seen people die
in the most appalling circumstances, and would not like either my
family or myself to suffer the same way.
<P>What particularly annoys me about this is, that to a certain extent,
euthanasia exists in hospitals today. When people are dying (whether
from disease or accident) one of the first things the consultants do is
to put them on a morphine pump. This is attached to the patient via
a needle in their abdomen and it gives a slow, continuous dose of
morphine. Morphine is a respiratory depressant and causes the patient
to die quicker than they normally would (with a few exceptions where
they built up a resistance to the morphine). This is legal and basically
amounts to a form of "helping people to die." However, if anyone
asks why the patient needs it, they are told it is because the patient
is suffering from a great deal of pain and this relieves it. Now, of
course terminal patients have pain, but I have rarely seen a level of
pain that requires the dose and amount of morphine given. The
morphine dose is increased on a daily basis (again with a few
exceptions) whether the patient requires it or not. One surgeon I
worked with told me to increase the dose and "knock him over the
edge... the quicker the better."
<P>The other way people are helped to die in hospitals is through the
withdrawal of all medical help. The patients are either N.F.R. (Not For
Resuscitation) or N.C.O. (Nursing Care Only). It is the consultant that
takes this decision, and all forms of monitoring and medical
intervention are removed. This includes Total Parenteral Nutrition
(T.P.N.) feeding. This is where somebody is fed through a catheter
which goes straight into the bloodstream, usually via the sub-clavian
route. this happens often. So, what I would like to know is, why is
all the fuss being made about removing naso-gastric feeding? Why is
it all right to withdraw T.P.N. feeding but not N.G. feeding? Why is it
acceptable to increase the dose of morphine someone is getting,
when they have no more pain, but it is not acceptable to give them
a lethal injection which would have the same effect, only quicker?
I have seen too many people die in too many terrible ways. It would
be nice if the moralist do-gooders could see past their own
selfishness and allow people to die with dignity. it is the people who
are left that are hurt. When there is no hope the very least we can
give people is dignity.
