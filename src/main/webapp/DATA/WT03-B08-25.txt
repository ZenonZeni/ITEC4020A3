MEMS DEVICES WILL CONTINUE TO CARVE OUT SIGNIFICANT
MARKETS

The foundation of MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems)
technology is the ability to create controllable, mechanical, moveable

structures using silicon IC technology, notes Dr. Janusz Bryzek,
president of Intelligent MicroSensor Technology (IMST, Fremont, CA,

510-770-9168). The silicon pressure sensor represents the first
commercially successful application of micromachining.

Since sensors are often the vital components determining the
feasibility of new products, they have a significant leverage factor,
enabling production of sensor-based systems exceeding sensor cost
by several orders of magnitude; e.g., a $10 MAP (manifold absolute
pressure) sensor facilitates production of fuel efficient, low polluting,

$25,000 cars. Originally an expensive and exotic technology, silicon-
based pressure transducers were initially employed exclusively in
specialized aerospace, testing, and instrumentation functions, Bryzek
explains. However, within the past decade, advances in silicon
micromachining manufacturing technology have created a plethora of
new uses for such technology.

Silicon is widely used in manufacturing purely electronic integrated
circuits, where only the material's electrical properties are exploited.

Micromechanics utilizes the electrical and mechanical properties of
silicon to create a new generation of electromechanical silicon chips.

Silicon micromachining technology is attractive, owing to its
mechanical properties and to the support available from the IC
industry. Mechanically, silicon is almost a perfect material for
pressure sensors, since it is stronger than steel, as light as aluminum,
not subject to mechanical hysteresis, highly sensitive to stress, and
can be readily batch micromachined. Support available from the
mainstream electronic industry includes proven semiconductor
manufacturing processes, ultra-pure, low-cost materials, advanced
manufacturing equipment, high-volume manufacturing and
packaging technologies, and educated technologists.

The significance of the leverage that silicon sensor technology enjoys
is particularly clear when comparing the total R&D expenditures in
the sensor and IC industries. The global sensor budget, covering a
diverse range of technologies, is on the order of $200 million
annually, according to Bryzek. Funding for new developments by the
IC industry and supporting services totals on the order of billions of
dollars per year. Adopting mainstream electronic industry
developments significantly reduces the development time and cost
for micromechanical devices; and new micromachining or sensor-
specific technologies can be developed from the rich foundation
created for electronic ICs.

The roots of silicon micromachining technology hark back to Bell
Laboratories. The research team developing the basics of
semiconductor technology discovered a piezoresistive effect in silicon
and germanium. The first research paper, published in 1954,
characterized the basic piezoresistive properties of such materials.
The piezoresistive effect creates a resistance change in the
semiconductor material in response to stress, which is about two
orders of magnitude larger than the equivalent resistance change of
metals used for non-silicon strain gage applications.

California's Silicon Valley played a vital role in bringing MEMS
devices to the marketplace. Characteristic of many semiconductor
companies, the initial silicon sensor start-ups spun-off from Fairchild
in the 1970s: ICT Transducers (now Foxboro/ICT, San Jose, CA);
National Semiconductor's Sensor Group (now SenSym, Milpitas, CA);
Endevco R&D (Sunnyvale, CA); and Cognition (now Rosemount, whose
Measurement Division is headquartered in Eden Prairie, MN).

Bryzek has helped pioneer and generate the market momentum and
infrastructure for silicon micromachined sensors, having been a co-
founder of such companies as NovaSensor, which was acquired by
British-based Lucas Industries, plc circa1990. Lucas NovaSensor(R)
(Fremont, CA) is under the rubric of Lucas Control Systems Products
(Hampton, VA), a part of Lucas Industries, plc.

During the past ten years, the Silicon Valley MEMS market has
emerged to form a mini industry. According to Bryzek, about 900
people are currently employed in the MEMS industry in the Valley,
which is comprised of eight active microsensor companies, 13

companies/organizations involved in microstructures, and three
university R&D centers. The average sales per employee for the top
three microsensor companies in Silicon Valley amounts to about
$133,000.

The total MEMS sensor/non-sensing market is forecast by Bryzek to
grow at a 16.5% compound annual rate to reach $6.7 billion in 2005,
compared to about $1.45 billion in 1995. The non-sensing MEMS
market (encompassing fluid controls, data storage, displays, biochips,

communication, and miscellaneous devices) is anticipated to advance
at 52.5% compound annual rate to total $3.4 billion in 2005, from
about $50 million in 1995.

The MEMS pressure sensor market is projected to expand at a 9.6%
compound annual rate, from $1.0 billion in 1995 to $2.5 billion in
2005. Shipments of silicon pressure sensors, according to Bryzek,
rose from about 3 million units in 1983 to over 40 million units in
1995, and are forecast to exceed 125 million units/year in the next
decade. The total market for MEMS inertial sensors is expected to
increase at nearly a 7.2% compound annual rate to reach $800
million in 2005, from $400 million in 1995. During the past three
years, the silicon acceleration sensor market mushroomed to 15
million units per year. Several additional MEMS inertial sensor
applications are in the initial commercialization phase, promising the

formation of billion dollar market opportunities.

Bryzek expects sanguine expansion in MEMS sensor markets, as well
as non-sensing MEMS applications. MEMS pressure sensors will
experience significant growth, primarily fueled by automotive
applications and smart sensors with networked output. Emerging
automotive applications for MEMS pressure sensors include fuel
vapor sensors, high-pressure fuel injection systems, diesel MAP
(manifold absolute pressure) sensors, and "braking by wire"
(electronic braking) in passenger cars and trucks. The volume of
inertial (acceleration, rate, gyro) sensors will rapidly expand, mainly
in the automotive and virtual reality sectors, accompanied by
substantial price erosion.

The next generation of fluidic components (such as pressure valves)
is expected by Bryzek to enjoy considerable growth. The current
generation of fluid controls is not yet capable of sufficiently meeting
user requirements, since they have drawbacks in terms of lack of
media compatibility, limited temperature range, and restricted
pressure range.

Active development of MEMS-based data storage technology is
underway; and Bryzek perceives the most commercially promising
development to be the hard drive head suspension (gimble) with an
on-chip servomotor, driven by an industry consortium initiated by
Professor D. Miu of UCLA.

The servomotor enables .1 um positioning accuracy of the head,
corresponding to about 100 GB/sq. in. read-write density, and fits
into the "sockets" of the existing mechanical devices to provide 10
um resolution. Since current industry volume is on the order of one
million heads per day, with an estimated volume price of about $5
for the gimble/head assembly, this application represents a potential
market of $1.3 billion. Moreover, several other storage chip
technologies hold promise for achieving volume production during
the next decade.

Activity in the area of MEMS display chips is being spearheaded by
Texas Instruments' (Dallas, TX) micromirror display development.
Two Silicon Valley start-ups are focusing on MEMS display
technology (electrostatically activated microbeams reflecting light),
including Echelle (Mountain View, CA). MEMS displays have potential
to capture a significant share of the large display industry.

MEMS biochips can allow a new generation of products to appear in
the marketplace, including DNA multipliers, chemical reactors, and
bacteria processors. Bryzek expects the MEMS biochip market to
grow briskly over the next ten years, adding that about one billion
biochips annually could potentially be used in DNA multipliers.
Concerning MEMS communication devices/components, fiber-optic
aligners have been on the market for a number of years. Bryzek
observes that the recent development of fiber-optic MEMS switches
has potential for enabling the implementation of on-demand
residential multimedia applications.

In November 1995, Dr. Bryzek left Lucas NovaSensor to start-up
IMST, which aims to become the global leader in smart integrated
and networkable sensors in less than five years. The company, which
is in the process of formation, plans to initially develop a new
generation of OEM pressure transducers featuring advances in
functionality, price/performance, quality, and reliability, while
retaining socket compatibility with many competitive "dumb"
devices. The products will incorporate a unique on-sensor-chip
pressure media protection capability to eliminate the need for metal

diaphragms. They will also offer a high level of electronics
integration, including electronic trimming for compensation and
calibration, wireless communication, and control networking.

Dr. Bryzek has initiated discussions with selected companies
interested in creating strategic partnerships with his new venture.
He plans to initially introduce products that meet the requirements
of such partners, and then unveil standard product lines. Dr. Bryzek
welcomes inquiries from companies interested in establishing a
business relationship with IMST.

Sincerely,
Peter Adrian, Editor

AMMI EXPLOITS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR SILICON
MICROMACHINED SENSORS

Advanced MicroMachines Incorporated (AMMi, Cleveland, OH, 216-
229-4636) has doubled its sales staff over the past few months to
capitalize on promising business opportunities in the silicon
micromachined sensors arena.

One opportunity entails the design and development of a
micromechanical extreme temperature sensing bimetallic switch that
does not require power. The device is based on the same principles
that apply in the macro world--two adjacent materials with different

coefficients of thermal expansion will experience a bending moment
along their lengths, as one material expands more than the other.
Although this concept is well over 100 years old, new challenges
must be surmounted when dealing with structures that are about the
size of a human eyelash, such as residual stresses formed in the
structures due to wafer processing.

However, micromachined bimetallic temperature sensors offer the
key benefits of enhanced sensitivity, due to both their larger
deflections and increased radii of curvature. Such advantages can be
leveraged to cost-effectively produce micromachined bimetallic
switches that latch into place when an extreme hot or cold
temperature is achieved, which enables the device to be effectively
applied for diagnostic monitoring. For example, such sensors are
sufficiently small to be embedded in a truck tire. When it is time to
retread the tire, a quick check can be performed to determine
possible damage to the polymer rubber caused by overheating.
Additional potential applications include relays, temperature
switches, and thermostats.

Another business opportunity identified by AMMi calls for designing
and developing a miniature array of high frequency response heat
flux sensors to be used inside a gas turbine engine. The product is
unique, since an array of sensors is embedded in a flexible material,
allowing for mounting many sensors onto the curved surface of a
turbine blade in a timely and effective manner. While the
commercial applications for such a product in aircraft engine testing
are limited due to high temperature constraints, many other market

opportunities are opened when other types of sensors are considered
as candidates for being embedded as arrays in flexible materials,
notes Louis Toly, AMMi's business manager.

AMMi's mission within the competitive sensor market is to be the
preferred source for the design, development, prototyping,
integration, testing, and packaging of microsensors and
microactuators for industrial and medical applications. The company
has expertise in all aspects of sensor design, including both the
sensor component and the associated ASICs for signal processing.
Such components are integrated in a hybrid configuration and
packaged for protection from harsh environments. The company,
therefore, can provide its clients with sensors possessing smart
capabilities.

AMMi began as a provider of consulting services in the area of MEMS
about two years ago, and still plans to continue in this arena. Large

corporations are often reluctant to invest manpower and equipment
in MEMS, due to the significant inherent financial risks involved in
making a new technology commercially available. AMMi helps
mitigate such risks by assisting new entrants in the silicon
micromachined sensors arena, which is fraught with growth
opportunities.

Demand for MEMS-based temperature sensors for tires is projected
to total $250 million (representing 25,000,000 units) in 2000,
according to System Planning Corporation's (Arlington, VA, 703-351-
8677) Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)  market study. The
global market for MEMS temperature sensors in automobiles is
forecast to reach $400 million (representing 40,000,000 units) in
2000. The report notes that sensors that demand for MEMS
temperature sensors is expanding in the automobile, truck, and tire
industries, and that such sensors will continue to find new
applications in such devices as fire alarms, HVAC systems, and
portable electronics.

The value of the Western European market for silicon temperature
sensors is projected to rise at a 10.6% average annual rate to total
$19.5 million in 1997, from $10.7 million in 1992, according to Frost
& Sullivan's report on The European Market For Silicon Sensors
(#RE1760/J). The market for silicon temperature sensors in Western
Europe is pegged at $15.9 million in 1995. In 1997, the end-user
industry distribution of the Western silicon temperature sensor
market will be: while goods (e.g., washing machines, dishwashers,
ovens, coffee makers)-35%; automotive-32%; HVAC (including
industrial/domestic thermostats)-10%; electronics/instrumentation
(temperature compensation and control)-15%; and "other" (including
shavers)-8%.

SBD  forecasts that global revenues for silicon/IC temperature
sensors will expand at a 6% compound annual rate to reach $40.2
million in 2000, compared to about $30 million in 1995.

FIBER-OPTIC SENSOR MAY SPARK DIESEL ENGINE COMBUSTION
PRESSURE MONITORING

The new diesel combustion pressure sensor (Model OPS350-3000)
available from Optrand, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI, 313-769-4094) is
designed for continuous, long-term operation under diesel
combustion conditions. The reliable, low-cost sensor-- which is
especially suitable for engine health monitoring or control in
stationary and movable diesel engines--is capable of withstanding
high overpressures and combustion detonations without suffering
damage or performance degradation.

Using Optrand's fiber-optic sensing technology developed for adverse

environmental applications, the OPS350-3000 operates at sensor
housing temperatures up to 350 degrees C, and has a guaranteed life
of 200 million cycles, which is purportedly not currently available
from other competing commercial products. Optrand's diesel
combustion pressure sensor is available in a sealed gage pressure
package, and is offered in two versions with accuracies of 1% and 3%.

In conjunction with Optrand OPT1000 series opto-electronic
interfaces, the sensor system provides a frequency response of 0.1
Hz to 15 kHz, covering engine knock frequencies. The sensor is
available in four miniature housing styles ranging in size from M5
(5mm diameter thread) to 3/8"-24 in diameter. Specifically intended
for high-volume and OEM applications, the OPS350-3000 is offered in
custom OEM housings suitable for direct engine installation in
addition to standard pressure configurations.

Incorporated in 1992, Optrand focuses on researching, developing,
and manufacturing fiber-optic sensors for extreme environments.
The company's products address pressure, temperature, air/fuel
ratio monitoring, and control requirements in the combustion engine,
electrical utility, and jet engine industries.

Marek Wlodarczyk, Optrand's president and CEO, told SBD  that the
OPS350-3000 provides key performance and design advantages over
competing piezoelectric and piezoresistive sensing technologies for
engine monitoring/control applications. He notes that piezoelectric
sensors, which are used predominantly for combustion engine
research/testing, are expensive, and have a relatively short life, due
to their construction and to the limitations of piezoelectric materials.

The silicon piezoresistive combustion pressure sensor, which
Wlodarczyk indicates is also mostly used for research purposes,
requires special mounting so that the temperature of the sensing
element does not exceed about 125 degrees C. Moreover, the
required size of the silicon piezoresistive sensor package (which
includes the sensor and electronics) limits its mounting flexibility in
the engine.

As noted in Multi-Channel Fiber-Optic Pressure Sensor System for
Monitoring and Control of Reciprocating Engines, by T. Poorman, S.
Kalishnikov, and M. Wlodarczyk, which was presented at the 10th
Annual Gas Machinery Conference & Exhibition  in October 1995,
sensing crystals are unable to withstand continuous high pressures.
Strain or capacitance gages used in pressure transducers exhibit
large unrepeatable, unpredictable changes in output at high
temperatures. The changes, resulting from such effects as alloy
segregation, phase changes, selective oxidation, and diffusion,
ultimately lead to premature failure of the gage or lead wires.

Transfer pin designs--which connect the pressure sensing diaphragm
to the crystal to separate the temperature-sensitive crystal from
high combustion temperatures--are subject to hysteresis and
repeatability errors, resulting from response variations induced by
temperature gradients presented to the mechanical assembly.

Water cooling is required for piezo-type sensors to operate over the
full range of combustion engine temperatures. The signal
conditioning electronics of such sensors must be located at or near
the sensor head to counteract strong EMI effects, which can subject
the electronic components to temperatures exceeding 125 degrees C,
thereby requiring expensive components with high-temperature
capability. The sensing crystal and the electronic circuitry must be

electrically and thermally well-shielded, resulting in a large sensor
package. The authors note that electronic sensors have not thus far
been able to effectively address the overall cost, size, reliability, and

high-temperature durability requirements for continuous engine
control applications.

Optrand's uncomplicated intensity-modulated fiber-optic combustion
pressure sensor, which uses an optical fiber in front of a flexing
diaphragm for optical reflection measurement of pressure-induced
diaphragm deflections, offers promise for satisfying the performance
and cost constraints of industrial and, over the longer-term,
automotive applications.

In contrast to both the piezoelectric and silicon piezoresistive
combustion pressure sensors, the OPS350-3000 does not require a
transfer pin to mechanically couple the diaphragm to the sensing
element. Furthermore, in the OPS350-3000, which does not require
special mounting, the top of the sensing element is only 30 microns
away from the diaphragm. The diesel combustion pressure sensor's
diaphragm, moreover, has been optimized in terms of its operating
and overpressure range, yield strength, and fatigue life.

Wlodarczyk notes that Optrand's longer-term strategy entails
offering reliable, low-cost fiber-optic sensors for use in passenger
cars. The OPS350-3000 is primarily intended for larger, less price-
sensitive engines. Target markets/applications include natural gas
and diesel fueled engines used in power generation, marine
applications, and locomotives. Optrand's OPS350-3000 has been
evaluated for use in stationary engines for power generation; and
OEMs have expressed keen interest in integrating the sensor into a
new generation of engine controls.

The starting prices for the OPS350-3000 sensor and signal
conditioning electronics are $395 and $595, respectively. In OEM
quantities (1,000 units), the sensor plus signal conditioning
electronics is available at a starting price of about $400.

Significant gains in the efficiency of large-bore combustion engines,

diminished levels of noxious emissions, and enhanced engine life can
be achieved via closed-loop engine controls based on combustion
pressure information, according to the aforementioned paper. The
use of cylinder pressure as a control parameter in gasoline engines
has been demonstrated to lead to optimal control of spark-timing,
engine speed, throttle, air/fuel ratio, and to an optimized response to
ambient conditions. In-cylinder pressure sensors can also provide for
direct and deterministic misfire detection. In lean burn combustion,

controlling spark timing and air/fuel ratio via in-cylinder
measurement so that "cold combustion" can occur leads results in
high efficiency, reduced NOx emissions, and minimized torque
variability.

Although reduced fuel consumption and increased torque output are
obtained in large-bore engines operating under lean burn conditions
and at higher compression ratios, the increased ratio leads to a
greater tendency toward engine knock. Effective knock control is
facilitated by monitoring each cylinder individually. Currently used
knock sensors mounted externally to the engine body can suffer
from shock and vibration effects.

Cylinder pressure information is of considerable value, along with
other engine parameters, for engine diagnostics and health
monitoring. Pressure trend analyses can extend maintenance
schedules and provide a warning before significant engine problems
develop.

In addition, there are opportunities to use continuous cylinder-
pressure monitoring to address existing and emerging emissions
regulations. The Clean Air ACT Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 will
induce most US operators of Stationary Reciprocating Internal
Combustion Engines (SRICEs) to continuously monitor and report
their emissions.

Some emissions sources will need to be equipped with Enhanced

Monitoring/Compliance Certification (EM/CC) capability, in which a
mechanism, procedure, or system will be implemented to ensure that
the unit complies with an emission limit/standard on a continuous
basis. Although cylinder pressure measurement does not provide
direct information on emissions, the authors note that maintaining
nominal pressure levels in all cylinders is a prerequisite for realizing
low emission levels. Moreover, cylinder pressure measurement is
described as the best predictor in Parametric Emissions Monitoring
Systems (PEMS) that are used to predict emission levels of
combustion emission gases, such as NOx, VOCs, and carbon monoxide
(CO), without requiring direct monitoring techniques.

Global revenues for fiber-optic pressure sensors are predicted to
expand at a 13.9% compound annual rate to reach $92.7 million in
1999, from $37.3 million in 1992, according to Frost & Sullivan's
World Fiber Optic Sensor Markets  report (912-40). Revenues for
1996-1998 are projected at $59.2 million, $68.0 million, and $79.0
million, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of fiber-optic pressure sensors are
anticipated to rise at an 18.3% compound annual rate to total
380,300 in 1999, compared to 117,100 in 1992. Unit shipments
during 1996-1998 are put at 200,700, 243,500, and 300,600,
respectively.

Revenues for the US fiber-optic pressure sensors market are forecast
to expand at a 13.2% compound annual rate to reach $65.8 million in
1999, from $27.6 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996-1998 are
projected at $42.8 million, $48.9 million, and $56.6 million,
respectively.

Unit shipments for the US fiber-optic pressure sensors market are
expected to rise at about a 17.7% compound annual rate to total
274,200 in 1999, as opposed to 87,900 in 1992. Unit shipments
during 1996-1998 are pegged at 147,100, 177,800, and 218,500,
respectively.

In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the total
global revenues for fiber-optic pressure sensors is (all figures are
rounded): process industries-17.3%; industrial machinery-11.4%;
medical-61.1%; and "other" (including power plants, explosives
manufacturers, plastic producers, automotive industry, and machine
tool manufacturers)-10.5%.

Revenues for the Western European market for fiber-optic pressure
sensors are forecast to advance at about an 8.7% compound annual
rate to reach $7.4 million in 1999, as opposed to $4.1 million in 1992,

according to Frost & Sullivan's report on Fibre Optic Sensor Markets
(Europe)  (1940-40). Revenues in 1996-1998 are placed at $5.6
million, $6.1 million, and $6.7 million, respectively.

Unit shipments for the Western European fiber-optic pressure
sensors market are expected to rise at a 13.3% compound annual rate
to total 34,452 in 1999, from 14,360 in 1992. Unit shipments for
1996-1998 are projected at 23,483, 27,038, and 30,582, respectively.

In 1996, the projected geographical distribution of the total revenues
for the Western European fiber-optic pressure sensors market is:
Germany-38.6%; UK-13.7%; France-16.0%; Italy-8.6%; Iberia (Spain,

Portugal)-9.2%; Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway)-
4.6%; Benelux (Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands)-4.6%; and the
rest of Europe (Austria, Greece, Ireland, Switzerland)-4.7%.

The world market for fiber-optic pressure sensors is forecast to
stand at $17.7 million in 1998, compared to $16.8 million in 1993,
according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s Fiber Optic
Sensors  report (LG-116R). Global unit volume of fiber-optic pressure
sensors is projected to total 16,000 in 1998, from 14,000 in 1993.

Civilian, open global demand for pressure sensors used in ships and
railborn vehicles is forecast to reach 49.5 mil. DM (about $29.1
million at the exchange rate of 1.7 DM for the dollar) in 2000,
compared to 45.7 mil. DM (about $26.9 million) in 1991 and 48.5 mil.
DM (about $28.5 million) in 1995, according to Prognos AG's Sensor
Technology 2000  report.

SBD  projects that global revenues for fiber-optic pressure
sensors/systems will expand at about an 8% compound annual rate
to reach $25.4 million in 2000, compared to about $17.3 million in
1995.

Global demand for automotive pressure sensors is projected at $210
million in 1995 and $240 million in 1996, according to BIS Strategic
Decisions' (Luton, England, ++44-1-582-405678) latest Automotive
Sensor Demand Forecast Market Report. Worldwide unit volume for
automotive pressure sensors in 1995 and 1996 is projected at
21,000,000 and 26,000,000, respectively.

RESEARCHERS CLARIFY KEY SOURCES OF INDOOR AIR VOCS

A research study funded by the Georgia Environmental Technology
Consortium--a division of the Georgia Research Alliance-- suggests
that metabolic gases emitted from molds and fungi growing inside
buildings may constitute a significant source of airborne volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) that can engender indoor air quality
problems collectively referred to as the "Sick Building Syndrome."

Indoor air quality problems have historically been blamed on
various factors, including emissions from particleboard partitions,
paints, carpets, and cleaning supplies. The study suggests that control

measures prescribed for sick buildings may have to be altered to
address microbial problems in addition to building materials.

"As molds and fungi grow, they give off metabolic gases that contain
VOC emissions," explained Dr. Charlene Bayer, principal research
scientist and director of the Georgia Institute of Technology's Indoor

Environment Research Program (Atlanta, GA, 404-894-3825). "Some
of the volatile compounds that we are finding are primary solvents;
and we think some of the manufacturers are being blamed for
emissions from their products when the emissions may actually be
coming from the microbes. Because the VOCs have usually been
attributed to other types of sources, the source control may be
incorrect."

Bayer and Sidney Crow, a biologist at Georgia State University
Southeast, collected fungi samples from buildings afflicted with
microbial contamination, and allowed the samples to grow in the
laboratory. The VOCs released from the microbial broths were
collected, identified, and then compared to those detected in the
ambient air within the buildings.

"Many of the volatile compounds produced by the cultured fungi are
identical to those originating from solvent-based building materials
and cleaning supplies," Bayer noted. "These VOCs included hexane,
methylene chloride, benzene, and acetone."

The microbial VOCs may contribute substantially to the overall level
of ambient VOCs in buildings, according to Bayer. For example, in one
building the researchers scrutinized, microbial contamination was
clearly evident on the walls, carpets, and other locations.

"The concentration of hexane--a solvent commonly used in cleaning
fluids, paints, and adhesives--was extremely high, but no source of
hexane could be found," Bayer stated. "The microbial contamination
could have been the source of the hexane."

Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus are among the myriad of
commonly occurring microbes that can beset homes, schools, and
offices. Typically, a foul, musty odor is the initial indication of their

presence. The rampant growth of such microbes produces headaches,
itchy eyes, rashes, and respiratory problems.

Conditions favorable for stimulating microbial growth include heat
and moisture. In the Southeast's semi-tropical climate, buildings are
major targets for microbial contamination.

Molds and fungi are not particular about what they eat, and will
devour nearly any organic material, including the dirt and dust
trapped within ventilation systems. To ameliorate the risk of
microbial contamination, one should first seek ways to reduce the
required nutrient base.

"Under ideal conditions, a building's ventilation system should filter
out both the microbes and the dirt they feed upon," Bayer indicated.

"Unfortunately, however, many homes, schools, and small office
buildings use cheap, throwaway filters in their ventilation systems."

Cheap furnace filters are merely "boulder catchers," Bayer remarks.
"They only catch the big stuff. They don't catch the fine dust
particles, and they don't catch the microbes. So, they really don't do
anything to help human health." Bayer recommends discarding the
cheap filters and replacing them with more efficient, albeit more
expensive, ones.

However, the problems with ventilation systems increase with the
size of the building. In the fiberglass-lined ductwork often used for
noise control in larger office buildings, the fibers tend to trap dirt,
which provides a rich nutrient base for the microbes.

"Add a little moisture, and you have a mold garden growing in your
network," Bayer declared. "The microbes grow and multiply, and
then get blown all over the building to infest other areas." Moisture
control is vital for preventing microbial contamination, since
microbial growth can skyrocket when the humidity rises. "Many
buildings erected in the Southeast simply were not designed to
handle the heavy humidity loads we have, particularly during our
hot, muggy summers," Bayer remarked. "And most building owners
don't run their ventilation systems continuously."

Schools typically turn their systems off during the summer months;
and most office buildings cycle their systems over nights and
weekends, often creating an unpleasant "Monday morning cocktail"
for the workers. Such intermittent operation permits the humidity to
increase and the molds to multiply.

Preventive maintenance encompasses proper filtration, correct
moisture control, and periodic cleaning of the entire ventilation
system, including the humidifier assembly on residential furnaces.
"Typical reservoir humidifiers are little mold factories," Bayer notes.
"They are just pools of standing, stagnant water throughout much of
the year that allow mold to grow and infiltrate the ducts. They
should be cleaned regularly."

A considerable amount of research remains to be conducted,
including identifying individual metabolic gases and their respective
odors, and acquiring a greater understanding of the microbes that
are producing them. The human response to molds and fungi, and the
sources of complaints in buildings can be more fully understood, once
a knowledge base is developed in these areas.

"Ultimately, we want to identify the microbial contamination on the
basis of the odors which are present," Bayer states. "That way, we
will be able to identify the source much more quickly and accurately,
and deal with the problem faster and more effectively...before it
becomes a major problem requiring extensive remediation."

SBD  forecasts that global revenues for gas sensors used in building
and safety applications will rise at a 9.4% compound annual rate to
total $185 million in 2000, compared to about $108 million in 1994.

Revenues for the Western European HVAC (heating, ventilating, and
air conditioning) market for gas sensors are forecast to increase at
more than a 28% average annual rate to reach about $16.8 million in
1998, from nearly $3.8 million in 1992, according to Frost &
Sullivan's European Gas Sensor Markets  report (1902-40). Revenues
for 1996 are pegged at nearly $10.1 million.

Unit shipments for the Western European HVAC gas sensor market
are projected to rise at about a 32.9% average annual rate to total
308,000 in 1998, compared to 56,000 in 1992. Unit shipments in
1996 are placed at 185,000.

The projected distribution of the total revenues for the Western
European HVAC gas sensor market by sensor type in 1996 is:

electrochemical-$6.15 million; zirconia-$0.05 million; and miniature
selective semiconductor-$6.5 million.

CALORIE SENSOR COULD HEAT UP CONSUMER HEALTH CARE AND
MEDICAL ARENAS

MOI Corporation (Pittsburgh, PA, 412-231-5776) has developed a
calorie sensor that measures body energy (calories) by using
sophisticated heat flow sensors that measure the body's heat flow.
The sensors are capable of measuring conductive, convective,
evaporative, and radiant heat flow. The heat flow detected by the
sensors is monitored by a minicontroller that calculates, after input
of anthropomorphic measurements, actual calorie expenditures. The
calorie sensor provides an accuracy comparable to that of oxygen
consumption measurements.

Measuring energy expenditure is reportedly quite difficult. A widely
accepted method of indirectly assessing energy expenditure is to
measure oxygen consumption. Directly measuring energy
expenditure requires expensive equipment and a controlled
environment, and is, therefore, limited to laboratory settings. Other
attempts at measuring energy expenditure, such as heart rate
monitors and motion sensors (accelerometers), have limitations
which adversely affect their measurement accuracy. Heart rate is not

well-correlated to calorie expenditures. Accelerometers cannot
measure calorie expenditure during static activity, and do not
accurately measure such expenditures during vertical motion (e.g.,
bike riding, stair climbing).

MOI's extremely sensitive calorie sensor actually measures the
amount of heat the body releases; and continuously, directly
measures the amount of calories that are "burned" by an individual
regardless of whether he/she is resting, sleeping, or vigorously
exercising. Key characteristics of the sensor include: simple
calibration (merely input height and weight); no usage restrictions
(all activities are accurately monitored, and 24 hour/day, 365
day/year use is possible); and design parameters are limited only by

electronics and sensing area considerations.

The determination of calorie expenditures is a vital component of a
weight control or fitness program. The MOI calorie sensor can be
configured as a watch-like consumer product for people wishing to
lose weight, or as a medical device for monitoring the calorie
requirements of patients with specific caloric needs, including
diabetics and critical care patients. The sensor can also be an
alternative or adjunct tool for oxygen consumption measurements for

researchers.

The calorie sensor is touted as the "next step" in the ongoing
development of personal diagnostics (i.e., glucose meters, home
cholesterol tests, pregnancy tests, blood pressure meters, pulse and
heart rate monitors) that has broad applicability to consumer
markets, since it offers individuals more control over their lives. The
genesis of the product--which embodies significant research and
product development--was guided by numerous focus groups of
potential consumers (including people in exercise, wellness, and
dieting programs), as well as endocrinologists, diabetologists, exercise

physiologists, and weight-loss industry executives. The results
indicate to MOI that there is a very substantial market for the calorie
sensor.

Prototype units are available, and have been used extensively by
university researchers in studying metabolism and obesity. The
system consists of two components--the sensor unit and the display
unit. A low power RF transmitter is used for communication with the
display unit. Capable of being either a simple LCD display or a more

sophisticated PC-based analysis system, the display unit uses a
prefabricated receiver to minimize design complexity. Patents for the
calorie sensor have been filed worldwide; and the first US patent
should be issued this spring. MOI seeks a licensee or partner for
creating a final design, manufacturing, and marketing.

A medical product development company, MOI has developed
successful and creative technology (including the BMC Accu-Chek
Advantage glucose system). The company specializes in applying
sensor technology to the needs of the medical marketplace, and has
particular expertise in biosensors and heat flow sensors. MOI--whose
principals are Neil Szuminsky and Paul Pottgen--has licensed patents
to sensor technology that have become highly successful products in
the consumer health care market.

Civilian, free global demand for calorimeters/thermal sensors is
projected to total 406.9 mil. DM (about $203.4 million at the
exchange rate of 2.0 DM for the dollar), compared to 278.9 mil. DM
(about $139.4 million) in 1991, according to Prognos AG's Sensor
Technology 2000  report.

BSAC AND CDS-PENN STATE TO INVESTIGATE PZT FILMS FOR MEMS
STRUCTURES

The Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC, 510-643-6690)) at
the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Dielectric
Studies (CDS) at Pennsylvania State University have been awarded
funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), under the Tie
Grant Industry/University/NSF Cooperative Research Program, to
conduct a mutually supportive research program on thin dielectric
and piezoelectric films applied to MEMS structures. The two-year
program is budgeted at $25,000 per year to each institution. The
principal investigators are Professor R.S. Muller at BSAC, and
Professors J.P Dougherty and Susan Trolier-McKinstry at CDS-Penn
State.

The two Centers will utilize their expertise to characterize films and
film preparation technologies from all sources, with the aim of
establishing reliable processes for producing dielectric and
piezoelectric films for MEMS applications. A key goal of the research
is to increase by at least an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) the

performance of piezoelectrically activated microdevices by
implementing highly active piezoelectric films--mainly PZT (lead-
zirconate-titanate)--in MEMS devices.

Fundamental work on surface micromachined devices, microsystems,
and components has been conducted at BSAC. Piezoelectric devices
have been built and integrated with silicon microelectronics,
primarily using thin-film zinc oxide (ZnO), a considerably less active

piezoelectric than PZT. Such zinc oxide devices--including
microminiature microphones and sound sources, acoustic wave
sensors, and fluid pumps--are expected to exhibit markedly
enhanced performance, as a result of substituting a highly active
piezoelectric material, such as PZT, for ZnO.

Recognizing the need for improved piezoelectric films, BSAC has
begun producing PZT thin films by using a state-of-the-art, one-
third-million-dollar advanced sputtering system. Moreover, other
fabrication facilities at UC Berkeley are starting to produce PZT; i.e.,
within the Department of Materials Science and Minerals Engineering
(under Professor T. Sands), and the Integrated Materials Laboratory.

CDS-Penn State has amassed a strong background in the preparation
and properties of PZT; and has conducted cutting-edge research in
the fabrication, and underlying physics of thin-film dielectric,
piezoelectric, and ferroelectric materials. CDS-Penn State researchers
have the background and equipment for extensive testing of film
materials.

In PZT Dielectrics for MEMS Applications --the proposal for the NSF
grant--the principal investigators note that piezoelectric and
ferroelectric films are finding an increasing number of applications in
the rapidly expanding MEMS field. Achieving a fundamental
understanding, reliability, and control over the fabrication of such
films is necessary to transform these advances into practical, reliable

engineering products. The need for piezoelectric film expertise is a
particular challenge for the US.

"In Japan, piezoelectrics have been incorporated into important
commercially successful products (starting with camera-focusing
drivers) for some years." Japanese researchers have focused on PZT
for microactuation, and have demonstrated considerable expertise
with the thin-film material. In the US, however, thin-film dielectrics
and piezoelectrics--especially PZT--are still primarily a focus area at

research laboratories. Via the tie-grant research, and the corporate

memberships of the two Centers, highly active piezoelectric, and high
quality dielectric, films for MEMs will be demonstrated to American
industry.

CDS has extensively studied piezoelectric materials--in bulk,
multilayer, thick- and thin-film forms--for their dielectric and
piezoelectric properties. The most useful piezoelectric materials are
ferroic nature--either ferroelectrics or closely related substances.
The intimate coupling between the piezoelectric and dielectric
properties in ferroics necessitates that both be completely
characterized to understand the materials and the physical
mechanisms responsible for their properties.

A central focus of the study is to understand the role of PZT film

microstructure, film composition, and electrode materials relative to
the observed response and charge storage in thin films of the
material. The dielectric and electromechanical properties of the films
will be studied using a wide variety of standard characterization
techniques, along with transmission electron microscopy and double
beam interferometry.

One of the open questions concerning the use of thin-film PZT sensors
and actuators is the degree to which non-180o domain walls
contribute to piezoelectric activity. In commercial (bulk) piezoelectric

actuators, typically up to half the strain obtained is associated with

domain-wall motion.

However, thin films are mechanically clamped by the substrate, and
generally have a considerably smaller grain size than bulk materials.
Since each of these factors can lead to clamping of the domain-wall

contribution to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties, it is
unclear what piezoelectric constants should be assumed for the film
in designing MEMS devices. The study will elucidate the role of
domain walls in controlling the piezoelectric properties of PZT thin
films, and provide a set of useful piezoelectric properties for MEMS
designers.

BSAC envisions a variety of surface micromachined devices
employing PZT films, including cantilevered actuators, microgrippers
with integral-force feedback, and accelerometers. The principal
investigators expect activating films of PZT to play a vital role that
cannot be matched by alternative piezoelectrics, such as ZnO. For
example, in-plane microgrippers presently in fabrication require the
large piezoelectric coupling offered by PZT for the desired deflection

amplitudes; and the sensitivity of piezoelectrically-based
accelerometers will be significantly bolstered by the large coupling

coefficients of PZT. Joel Nice, BSAC's manager, indicated that PZT

accelerometers would offer such advantages as increased sensitivity,
greater frequency range, and instantaneous readout.

SBD  projects that global revenues for automotive and non-
automotive silicon micromachined accelerometers will increase at a
27.2% compound annual rate to reach $169.5 million in 2000,
compared to about %50.9 million in 1995.

Worldwide revenues for piezoelectric accelerometers are projected at
$116.7 million in 1996, according to Frost & Sullivan's World
Acoustic and Vibration Sensors and Test Instruments Market  report
(727-30).

The US market for microactuators is projected to total about 2 million
ECU (approximately $2.6 million at the current exchange rate) in
1995 and 30 million ECU (about $38.7 million) in 2000, according to
sgt Sensor Consulting Dr. Guido Tschulena's (Wehrheim, Germany,

++49-6081-56168) Micromechanics  report.

SENSORS AND ACTUATORS ARE BECOMING THE SOUL OF THE
MACHINE

The application of sensors and actuators is becoming increasingly
important for controlling machines and plants, and is determining
the internal competition of machine building companies, according to
a detailed investigation of the current state and key trends in the use
of sensors and actuators in the German and Dutch machine building
industry.

The study, conducted by sgt Sensor Consulting Dr. Guido Tschulena,
scrutinized six selected sectors of the machine building industry in
Germany and The Netherlands: agricultural and horticultural
machines; textile machinery; lifting and handling equipment; wood,
furniture, and paper machinery; and packing and packaging
machinery.

Electronics control and sensors/actuators accounted for 14.5% and
3.65%, respectively, of the total selling value of the machines. The
share of the total machine value attributed to sensors and actuators
for each machine building segment is: packaging machinery-3.3%;
lifting and handling equipment-4.5% (floor conveyor and stock
systems-12.8%; passenger, mass, and part loads transport-2.1%);
textile machinery-5.6%; woodworking and processing machinery-
3.4%; machinery for food and beverages-1.9%; and agricultural
machinery-2.3%.

Information--including the degree of automation in the selected
sectors, and the specific profit for the machine builders--has been
gathered from 122 companies, representing 253 machine products.
The sensors that are commercially available at present only partially
fulfill the product requirements, such as quality, reliability, and
freedom from maintenance.

The investigation demonstrates that the use of sensors and actuators
is enhancing the economy of machines and plants and boosting the
quality of fabricated goods. The high technical standard of the
machine builder is reflected in their ability to integrate appropriate
sensors and actuators into the machines. Moreover, the utilization of
sensors and actuators provides a powerful tool for machine builders
to differentiate their products from those of their competitors.

Figure 1 shows the percentage share of various types of sensors that
are used in the German- and Dutch-built machines, based on the
responses of 122 companies, encompassing 253 machines. The share
of the various types of actuators used in such machines is:
micromechanical-5%; electric-80%; pneumatic-51%; mechanical-33%;
and hydraulic-36%.

The investigation was conducted for Centrum voor Micro-Elektronica.

NANO-ENGINEERED MATERIALS IMPROVE SENSOR PERFORMANCE

Sensor technology can significantly benefit from nano-engineered
materials (i.e., materials whose grain sizes have been precision
engineered at scales of less than 100 nanometers, a shown in Figure
2), notes Dr. Tapesh Yadav, president of Nanomaterials Research
Corporation (NRC, Tucson, AZ, 520-294-7115). Such materials exhibit
a very high interfacial area and a unique blend of physical and
electrochemical properties.

When their grain size is reduced below 10 nanometers, conventional
materials exhibit unique properties because quantum confinement
effects increasingly become dominant. The confinement effects
enable a blend of mechanical properties that simplify and accelerate
sensor fabrication. Moreover, the nano-engineering of sensors allows
for miniaturization to sub-micron levels. The high interfacial area,
unique electrochemical properties, confinement effects, and
packaging advantages of nano materials offer an opportunity for
engineering sensors in general, particularly chemical sensors, that
provide substantially improved sensitivity, selectivity, response
time, stability, and reliability.

Under NASA and ARPA sponsorship, a team of scientists at NRC and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is developing a
range of nano-engineered sensors (NANOSENSORS(TM)) for industrial,
domestic, and medical applications. The effort has already
demonstrated several sensors with superior performance. For
example, nano-engineered oxygen sensors have been prepared from
a ceramic composite.

Such oxygen sensors are easier to prepare than conventional oxygen
sensors because of the ease in which the ceramic layer can be made
more fully dense without losing its interface area. Nano-engineered
oxygen sensors can operate at temperatures of less than 500 degrees
C (which is nearly half the temperature required by conventional
oxygen sensors), and exhibit enhanced selectivity, stability, and
response time. Furthermore, nano-engineered hydrogen sensors have
been found to exhibit an order of magnitude higher sensitivity.

Applications for nano-engineered sensors that are under
investigation include automobiles, neonatal care, industrial process

monitoring, and domestic safety. In automobiles, low-temperature
oxygen sensing can facilitate more rapid control of engine
combustion during cold-engine ignition; and oxygen sensors with
enhanced stability and sensitivity can help control optimal
fuel/oxygen stoichiometry and reduce NOx emissions. Nano-
engineered humidity sensors can help provide auto-control of
humidity inside the passenger cabin.

By utilizing lower energy consuming, less intrusive, more sensitive

nano-engineered sensors, health care quality can be bolstered, while
reducing costs in intensive care units and for premature babies. In
the industrial area, NRC sensors are particularly suited for moderate

temperature (RT to 700 degrees C) process monitoring in the
chemical, metallurgical, and utility industries. In addition, nano-
engineered sensors can enable more reliable technology with
reduced false alarms for domestic monitoring of carbon monoxide
and VOCs.

To meet the anticipated market and product development
requirements for nano-engineered sensors, NRC is also scaling-up its

patent-pending synthesis process for bulk producing the precursors
necessary for preparing nano-engineered sensors. The process is
capable of producing precision distributed, 1 to 100 nanometer scale
powders of sensor precursors (ceramics, metals, intermetallics,
composites). The effort is sponsored in part by NASA, the DOE, the US
Army, and the NSF. Moreover, several leading corporations have
initiated discussions with NRC regarding focused, milestone-based
strategic alliances for meeting their anticipated needs for next-
generation sensors.

Revenues for the US market for automotive lambda oxygen sensors
are forecast to increase at a 20% compound annual rate to reach $465
million in 1998, from $156 million in 1992, according to Frost &
Sullivan's Industrial Gas Sensor Markets  report (2661-40). Revenues
for 1996 are pegged at $385 million.

Revenues for the US zirconia gas sensor market are predicted to
expand at a 10% compound annual rate to total $43.1 million in 1998,
compared to $24.5 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996 are placed at
$35.8 million.

In 1996, the projected industry distribution of the total US zirconia
oxygen sensor market is: power generation-$9.1 million;

chemical/petrochemical-$12.2 million; metals/steel-$3.1 million;
commercial (office buildings)/health care-$4.1 million; and "other"
(including glass, ceramic, and semiconductor)-$7.3 million.

Revenues for the Western European market for lambda oxygen
sensors are forecast to advance at a 23.5% average annual rate to
reach $347.7 million in 1998, from $97.9 million in 1992, according
to Frost & Sullivan's European Gas Sensors  market report (1902-40).
Revenues for 1996 are put at $150.9 million. The data
overwhelmingly refers to closed-loop engine control application for
such sensors in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters.

Unit shipments of lambda oxygen sensors in Western Europe are
anticipated to rise at a 21.5% average annual rate to total about
24,200,000 in 1998, as opposed to about 7,500,000 in 1992. Unit
shipments for 1996 are projected at about 11,600,000.

Revenues for the Western European zirconia gas sensor market are
expected to increase at a 2.4% average annual rate to reach $17.2
million in 1998, from $14.9 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996 are
pegged at $16.5 million.

Unit shipments for the Western European zirconia gas sensor market
are predicted to rise at a 4.5% average annual rate to total 8,670,000
in 1998, from 6,650,000 in 1992. Unit shipments in 1996 are placed
at 7,945,000.

In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the total
revenues for the Western European zirconia gas sensor market is (all
figures are rounded): chemicals-$2.4 million; petrochemicals-$2.7
million; power generation-$4.0 million; steel-$1.4 million; heat
treatment-$1.7 million; HVAC-$0.1 million; and "other"-$4.3 million.
Such zirconia gas sensors are primarily used for combustion
monitoring applications, where they are configured as fixed
installations for heavy-duty boilers and furnaces, or used in
fixed/portable combustion efficiency test equipment.

Global demand for automotive oxygen sensors is projected to total
$745 million in 1999, compared to $341 million in 1994,
representing a 16.9% compound annual growth rate, according to BIS
Strategic Decisions' (Luton, England) latest Automotive Sensor
Demand Forecast Market Report.

SBD  forecasts that global revenues for solid electrolyte/Lambda
automotive oxygen sensors will increase at a 5.8% compound annual
rate to stand at $675 million in 2000, compared to about $480
million in 1994. The growth over the forecast period will be
primarily driven by California and federal OBD (On-Board
Diagnostics)-II requirements necessitating that the vehicle self-
diagnose/monitor the hydrocarbon conversion efficiency of the
catalyst system, which began to take effect in new emissions control
systems during the 1994 model year.

The automotive industry is now mainly using a dual oxygen sensor
system (rather than a single oxygen sensor) to diagnose the catalyst's

deterioration and monitor its hydrocarbon performance. However,
the dual oxygen sensor method has limitations for addressing
increasingly stringent automotive emissions monitoring
requirements, since it essentially measures the catalyst's oxygen
storage capacity, rather than catalyst hydrocarbon conversion
efficiency. By circa the end of the decade, the growth in the
automotive oxygen sensor market is expected to be negatively
impacted by competition from other gas sensors that are capable of
more directly monitoring low levels of key (non-oxygen) exhaust
gases to diagnose the catalyst's efficiency.

INNOVATIVE SENSORS COULD REFRESH AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS

Hokuriku Electric Industry Co. (Toyama-ken, Japan, ++81-0764-67-
1111) is focusing on developing high-performance composite sensors,
including a 30 mm square module comprised of a high-density
ceramic substrate and a sensor capable of measuring temperature,
air current, radiation, and humidity. The IC substrate functions as the
signal processing circuit for the module that could be used in air
conditioner systems. The company, which uses various technologies
to promote its sensor business, also has other single-unit composite
sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and dew formation.

Yamatake-Honeywell (Tokyo, Japan, ++81-03-3486-2031) has
developed a radiation temperature sensor for measuring
temperature in perimeter zones that are affected by light radiated
from the sun. The device is designed to measure radiated heat from a
remote location (ceiling) to form a monitoring system for an air
conditioner controller used to adjust the temperature to a
comfortable level. The sensor, which sells for 30,000 yen per unit
(about $296.40 at the current exchange rate), can be attached to the
ceiling, as well placed in open space where there are no columns or
walls.

Civilian, open global demand for temperature sensors used in the
area of heating, air conditioning, and ventilating technology is
projected to reach 353 mil. DM (about $176.5 million) in 2000, from
177.6 mil. DM (about $88.8 million) in 1991, according to Prognos
AG's Sensor Technology 2000  report.

The civilian, free Japanese market for temperature sensors used for
climate technology in the building and safety area is forecast to total
66.9 mil. DM (about $44.6 million at the exchange rate of 1.50 DM for
the dollar) in 1996 and 89.5 mil. DM (about $59.7 million) in 2001,
according to Intechno Consulting AG's (Basel, Switzerland) Sensor
Markets 2001  report. An updated version of the report is now
available.

SBD  estimates that global revenues for infrared temperature sensors
(excluding IR thermal imaging) totaled about $102 million in 1995.
