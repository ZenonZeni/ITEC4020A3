<CENTER><B>1996 ENDS WELL FOR ETHANOL INDUSTRY</B></CENTER>
<P>
1996 ended on a positive note for the ethanol industry with year-end daily production approaching 1995 levels.  According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), ethanol production exceeded 78,000 barrels per day (bb/d) in October and November, and is estimated to exceed 82,000 bb/d in December.  This compares with a 4th quarter average in 1995 of 85,000 bb/d.
<P>
Earlier this year, ethanol production fell to just under 40,000 bb/d, a record low in recent years, as corn prices topped $5/bushel because of historically low stockpiles and high export demand.  At the same time, gasoline prices fell over the summer, greatly reducing octane margins.
<P>
"The ethanol industry has weathered the storm, and the outlook is good for 1997 following a 9.3 billion bushel 1996 corn crop," said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association.

<B><U>Ethanol Production Competitive with Other Oxygenates</U></B><BR>
Rising ethanol production, combined with rising methanol prices and thus reduced domestic MTBE production, has brought the U.S. oxygenate market into competitive balance once again.  At more than 80 M bb/d, ethanol production now represents 82% of domestic MTBE production at merchant facilities.
<P>
However, MTBE imports also continue to rise, taking a larger percentage of the U.S. oxygenate market.  DeWitt & Company estimates that MTBE imports now exceed 61 M bb/d, or approximately 64% of domestic merchant MTBE production.  1996 MTBE imports are expected to exceed 935,000 gallons, only slightly less than total ethanol production for the year.  As noted by Jack Huggins, President of Pekin Energy, during testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee this past fall, such a level of imported MTBE is an additional threat to U.S. energy security and "represents imports for product that could be met with domestic production."

<CENTER><B>AG GROUPS REITERATE SUPPORT FOR ETHANOL</B></CENTER>
<P>
Sending a strong message of support for the federal ethanol program, the nation's leading agricultural organizations joined in writing a letter to each member of the Transportation Tax Task Force reiterating agriculture's support for the ethanol tax incentive.  The Transportation Tax Task Force is an informal task force created by House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) to review transportation-related taxes in anticipation of the reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund later this year.  Chairman Archer has stated his intention to eliminate the ethanol tax exemption during the 105th Congress.<P>

<B>"The ethanol program is sound public policy... we<BR>
 hope that you will keep the views of farmers in<BR>
 mind, and preserve this vital domestic energy,<BR>
 environmental and agricultural program."</B>
<HR WIDTH=350>
</CENTER>
<P>
Citing their support for ethanol, the agricultural groups note that "in 1995 alone, more than 560 million bushels of grain were processed into ethanol, increasing farm income by more than $2.2 billion and adding more than $7 billion to the national economy."  Ethanol also "helps to reduce our balance of trade by increasing exports of ethanol coproducts, including corn gluten, and lowering imports of oil and petroleum products."  Ethanol "is also a critical component of cleaner reformulated gasolines that are helping many U.S. cities meet air quality standards."
<P>
The authors note that "perhaps more than anyone, farmers recognize the need for and are committed to balancing the budget and eliminating unnecessary federal spending."
<P>
"The 1996 Farm Bill clearly reflects that commitment."  However, "the federal ethanol program is not an example of unnecessary spending.  The tax incentives for ethanol production have helped to build this important value-added industry, just as federal incentives have helped support the domestic oil and gas industry."  
<P>
The letter concludes, "The ethanol program is sound public policy that deserves to be maintained.  As you begin your review of transportation tax issues, we hope that you will keep the views of farmers in mind, and preserve this vital domestic energy, environmental and agricultural program."

<CENTER><B>EIA RELEASES SECOND SURVEY RESULTS OF AFV INDUSTRY</B></CENTER>
<P>
 More than 385,000 vehicles in the U.S. will be powered by fuels other than gasoline and diesel in 1997, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  Of these vehicles, 70 percent will operate on propane, 20 percent on natural gas, and the remaining alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) will be alcohol-fueled and electric vehicles.  
<P>
The EIA estimates that by 1997, alternative and replacement fuels, including oxygenates such as ethanol, will account for 2.7 percent of the fuel used by on-road vehicles (on a gasoline-equivalent gallon basis), up from 1.6 percent in 1992.  Consumption of alternative and replacement fuels is expected to increase about 5 percent from 1995 to 1997, to 4 billion gasoline equivalent gallons.

<CENTER><B>DENVER PROVES OXYFUEL EFFICACY;
CITY REPORTS NO CO EXCEEDANCES IN 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the first time since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, Denver did not have a single violation of federal air quality standards in 1996.  Denver has a history of exceedingly high carbon monoxide pollution, and with passage of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, was designated a serious carbon monoxide (CO) non-attainment area. 
<P> 
Since the introduction of the mandatory oxygenated fuels program in 1991, Denver has experienced a significant decline in carbon monoxide emissions.  There were two carbon monoxide violations in 1995, one in 1994, and six in 1992, compared with 125 in 1972.  In order to be redesignated by the Environmental Protection Agency as in attainment, Denver must have three consecutive years with no federal air quality standards violations.

<B>"We believe that this clean air success story is<BR>
 being used by opponents to threaten the<BR>
 program... Colorado is the fifth fastest<BR>
 growing state in the nation.  We continue to<BR>
 need all the help that oxyfuels provide."</B>

<HR WIDTH=350>
</CENTER>
<P>
In light of the effectiveness of oxygenated fuels in reducing CO emissions in Denver, a number of environmental and health related organizations have asked the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission to maintain Denver's oxyfuel program.  
<P>
The American Lung Association, Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Colorado Environmental Coalition, and Coloradans for Clean Air are opposed to the shortening or weakening of Colorado's oxygenated gasoline program.  "We believe that this clean air success story is being used by opponents to threaten the program," said Barbara Charnes, Executive Director of Coloradans for Clean Air.  "Colorado is the fifth fastest growing state in the nation.  We continue to need all the help that oxyfuels provide."  
<P>
According to the organizations, "the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for CO significantly underestimates vehicle miles traveled (VMT).  Any shortening or weakening of the program would be a serious public health concern in light of the underestimated and rapidly increasing VMT.  They note that health researchers have found a consistent link between increasing levels of ambient CO and increasing hospital admissions for congestive heart failure for the elderly.  In Colorado, 134,500 people are at risk for CO pollution.
<P>
"The oxygenated gasoline program is a very cost-effective strategy to reduce carbon monoxide pollution.  Furthermore, as the program provides significant air quality and public health benefits, we should not shorten or weaken the program in light of Colorado's growth and increasing vehicle miles traveled," concluded the statement.
<P>
The effectiveness of oxyfuels in substantially reducing CO concentrations was demonstrated in a comprehensive analysis recently completed by Systems Applications International (SAI).  The study found that when wintertime oxyfuel is used, the corresponding ambient CO concentrations are reduced by approximately 14 percent.

<CENTER><B>EPA CREDITS RFG WITH REDUCING POLLUTION</B></CENTER>
<P>
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) annual report on air quality trends, the nation's air is about 30 percent cleaner today than it was 25 years ago.  According to the National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, emissions of the nation's six major pollutants.  
<P>
According to the report, carbon monoxide, ozone, NOx, PM10, sulfur dioxide and lead have decreased by 29 percent over the last 25 years, even though the gross domestic product, total population and vehicle miles traveled rose considerably.  
<P>
Reformulated gasoline (RFG) was credited with a significant decline in the concentration of toxic air pollutants, including ambient benzene levels, which decreased 38 percent from 1994 to 1995.  Carbon monoxide pollution, which is primarily caused by vehicle exhaust, fell 10 percent between 1994 and 1995. "Reformulated gasoline has proven to be the most cost-effective means of reducing harmful levels of air pollutants," said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association.

<CENTER><B>FTC FUEL AND VEHICLE LABELING GUIDES AVAILABLE</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prepared two business guides -- Labeling Fuels and Labeling Alternative Fueled Vehicles -- to answer questions about the FTC's Labeling Requirements for Alternative Fuels and Alternative Fueled Vehicles Rule.  The Rule was issued in May, 1995 in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
<P>
The Rule applies to manufacturers and retailers of new alternative fueled vehicles, dealers of used alternative fueled vehicles, and certain conversion companies; producers, refiners, distributors and retailers of non-liquid alternative vehicle fuels; and makers of electric vehicle fuel dispensing systems.
<P>
These guides explain the Rule, address commonly asked questions, and include sample labels as well as a copy of the Rule for reference.  Labeling Fuels also explains the provisions of the Automotive Fuel Ratings, Certification and Posting Rule, which deals with liquid automotive fuels (except diesel), including liquid alternative fuels.
<P>
The FTC has also completed a consumer-oriented brochure entitled Consider the Alternatives: Alternative Fueled Vehicles and Alternative Vehicle Fuels.  The brochure explains the labels that consumers see on alternative fuel dispensers and on AFVs.
<P>
For copies of these brochures, contact the FTC, Public Reference Branch, Room 130, Washington, DC 20580; (202) 326-2222.  The full text is also available on the Internet at <A HREF="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.
