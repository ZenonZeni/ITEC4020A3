PROCUREMENT CUTS MAY STALL NLOS FOG-M

     Procurement cuts over the next few years in the Army's Non-
Line Of Sight (NLOS) fiber optic guided-missile (FOG-M) program
indicate that the service intends to halt the program after it
completes development and put the technology on the shelf for
possible future use, industry sources tell MILITARY FIBER OPTICS
NEWS (MFON).
     An Army source tells MFON that advanced procurement funding
for the NLOS FOG-M program was deleted for FY '91 and added that
it will suffer budget decrements in fiscal 1992 and 1993.  Fiscal
1991 procurement of the NLOS system is currently set at $131.2
million.
     The source also disclosed that the advanced procurement cuts
could result in an NLOS FOG-M procurement slip of six months to
one year.
     A spokesman at the Army Missile Command in Huntsville, Ala.,
could not confirm whether NLOS FOG-M advanced procurement funding
for FY '91 had been nixed but said that if this happens the
program schedule will slip.
     The FY '90 defense budget provides $129.4 million in
engineering development for the FOG-M program and $32.5 million
in advanced procurement.
     The reason for the advanced procurement funding cut,
according to one Army source, is that the Army's Air Defense
School in Fort Bliss, Texas, "felt it was more important that the
money go for other air defense programs.  They could live with
budget decrements in the early years of the program and the
program would still go ahead; it would just inconvenience them."
     The Air Defense School is the prime proponent for the NLOS
air defense application and has responsibility for establishing
the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements
for the system.
     According to the industry sources, the Army has determined
for the moment that it is going to emphasize the Martin Marietta-
developed Air Defense Anti-Tank System (ADATS) over the NLOS for
the anti-helicopter role in the Army's Forward Area Air Defense
System (FAADS).  They said that the Army will develop and test
the fiber optic guided-missile technology but that the service
does not intend to procure or field this particular weapon
system.
     Last December an industry team consisting of Boeing Military
Airplanes and Hughes Aircraft Co. won a 43-month $125 million
contract for full-scale engineering development of the NLOS
system.  Current Army plans call for the eventual deployment of
18 systems per air defense battalion.

NLOS Associate Proponency Undecided

     A decision made in late August by Lt. Gen. Leonard Wishart
of TRADOC to establish associate proponency for the NLOS FOG-M
combined arms system at the Army's Field Artillery School at Fort
Sill, Okla., (MFON, Sept. 8, 1989), was revisited by TRADOC
Commander Gen. John W. Foss, according to an Army source, who
said Foss has put off a final decision on associate proponency.
He noted that the final decision will at the least "await the
results of the NLOS Concept Evaluation Program (CEP)" of which a
draft is due on Jan. 15.  He added that the outcome on proponency
is unclear due to "all the budget cuts and turmoil" associated
with projected defense spending reductions.
     For the past year the Army's Combined Arms Center, Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., has been conducting the CEP which is aimed at
studying ways to integrate the air defense and ground
applications of FOG-M, including feasibility of its combined arms
mission.
     If associate proponency is established, this could double
the size of the NLOS FOG-M program," Army sources told MFON in
September (MFON, Sept. 8, 1989).  If FOG-M is procured for field
artillery battalions, up to 36 systems could be deployed with
each of these units.  There are 16 divisions in the Army and each
has a field artillery and air defense battalion.

MOSBACHER BACKS TRANS-SOVIET FIBER LINK

     Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has endorsed U.S.
participation in a proposed international effort to lay a fiber
optic communications line across the Soviet Union if the
technology involved is not the most sophisticated available.  He
said recently that technology that is five to 10 years old could
be approved for transfer.
     Mosbacher's comments follow a recent warning by Frank
Gaffney, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear
forces and arms control, that the proposed fiber line linking
Japan, the Soviet Union and Europe would greatly improve the
Soviet telephone network and consequently enhance military
command, control and communications (MFON, Dec. 15, 1989).
Gaffney also said the fiber link would make it more difficult for
U.S. intelligence agencies to monitor Soviet strategic military
communications.
     Talk within the Executive Branch about relaxing export
controls for Eastern Europe has reached the highest levels.
President Bush said just before Christmas that "it's timely to
take a new look at some of the commercial constraints."  And
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, said in
November that "we and our COCOM partners want to signal our clear
willingness to respond constructively to the democratization
under way in Eastern Europe."
     The Defense Department, a key player in any decision on
relaxing high-technology export controls to Eastern Europe, has
not publicly made a stand on the Soviet fiber optic link issue or
on any recent comments by government officials expressing a
willingness to relax technology export control to East European
countries.  A Pentagon spokesman tells MFON that DoD does not
publicly comment on interagency issues and is not likely to on
these.
     Transfer of the fiber optic technology to the Soviet Union
is currently prohibited by the Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) and would need U.S.
government approval to take place.  COCOM approval is seen as
less difficult than U.S. approval because Western Europe, Japan
and Australia have historically been less resistant to technology
transfer than the United States.
     U S West International, the U.S. participant in the planned
international effort, is expected to make a formal application
for the project this month.

U.S. Planning To Ease Technology Export Controls

     In response to the rapidly changing political landscape in
Eastern Europe, the Bush administration is examining plans to
ease export controls on advanced computers and telecommunications
equipment to East European countries, Mosbacher said recently.
He added that special exceptions for Poland and Hungary might
also be worked out because these two have formed non-communist
governments.
     The Commerce secretary said that Polish and Hungarian
officials have said they would carefully manage the transfer of
Western high-technology exports to their countries to prevent the
retransfer of that technology and to safeguard any technologies.

DCA BEGINS USING COAX AND FIBER-BASED LAN

     The Headquarters of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA,
Arlington, Va.) has begun using an IEEE 802.3 standard ethernet
local area network (LAN) based on thick and thin coax Ethernet
cable and fiber optic cable for connectivity between servers and
the customer base, the Agency has announced.
     According to the DCA, the "fiber optic cable provides intra-
building connectivity, and thick Ethernet cable provides inter-
building connectivity.  Thin Ethernet currently provides
connectivity from workstations to the media access controllers."
     The announcement also said that the LAN provides E-Mail,
calendaring, user-shared text processing and access to the DCA
Wang hosts.  "With this robust mail capability LAN users can
contact approximately 1,500 DEA personnel in the National Capital
Region and the Acquisition Management Directorate at Scott, AFB,
Ill."
     A DCA official told MFON last week that the Agency plans to
have implemntation of the LAN at the DCA Headquarters completed
this month and will install a LAN at a DCA complex in Reston,
Va., this summer.  He added that DCA is looking into installing
the same LAN at its office complex in Europe.
     The LAN was designed and installed by the Army's Information
Systems Engineering Command, Fort Ritchie, Md.  And according to
the DCA, the LAN is "part of an overall networking project that
includes the installation of a broadband cable plant."
     Eventually, video distribution at the DCA Headquarters will
be carried over this broadband cable.  (DCA, 8th & South
Courthouse Road, Arlington, VA  22204.  Bev Sampson, 202/692-
2006.)

IDA ANALYST SEES JAPAN DOMINATING FUTURE FOG MARKET

     Japanese firms are spending a lot of money on their
production base to build fiber optic material and component parts
for use in fiber optic gyroscopes (FOGs) in order to position
themselves to capture a large share of the eventual marketplace
for this technology, John P. McHale, an analyst with the
Institute of Defense Analyses (IDA), said recently.
     Speaking to the Washington (D.C.) Section of The Institute
of Navigation last month, the former Navy official said that "the
Japanese are spending out the door" for research and development
(R&D) on FOGs.  In an interview with MFON last month, McHale
said, "In my opinion, unless we control the market and obtain
adequate funding and have a U.S. capability, what's going to
happen is other nations are going to come in and invest money in
the technology, and Japan is doing it already, to become the
dominant supplier for high-quality, relatively low-cost fiber
optic material."
     McHale said that the United States cannot afford to have a
national R&D capability in fiber optics unless "we have a
production and manufacturing base.  And we cannot have a
production base unless we have a national economic base on which
it is built."  He described the economic base as being the
"demands, requirements, funding and long-term tax advantages for
companies to invest money into the product."
     McHale's views are not without foundation.  He retired from
the Naval Air Systems Command in February 1988 where he was in
charge of the Gyro and Inertial Systems Section for 20 years.  In
addition to his work at IDA, he is also a consultant to several
firms and chairman of the Critical Technologies Technical Working
Group (TWG) for Inertial Systems (4B) and of the Magnetometers
and Magnetic Gradiometers TWG (4E).  McHale has also been
supporting the Pentagon in the drafting of technical proposals
for U.S. negotiating positions for COCOM.

What Must The U.S. Do?

     Why are the Japanese showing such promise in the area of
FOGS and high-technology in general and what must the United
States do to make sure its firms capture at least a significant
share of the FOG market?  According to McHale, in Japan
centralized leadership for applying new technologies is provided
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) which
helps Japanese firms plan long term, find product applications
and market overseas.
     He pointed out that there is no parallel in the United
States to MITI.
     "The long-term plan of any U.S. fiber optic company is zero
to five years," McHale said.  On the other hand, "MITI's long-
term plan is 250 years," McHale said, "and they have very
advanced planning in terms of technological and manufacturing
production capability and a masterplan for it at a nationwide
level."
     While the U.S. government does not necessarily have to
invest money into FOG R&D, McHale said, it must at least show
leadership in determining standards for the technology "so that
not all our companies are going off in 13 different directions
without a national plan.  U.S. companies are each going their own
way; They can't compete by themselves."
     In his speech McHale also pointed to the need for a
different tax structure for the U.S. industrial base that
provides incentives for investing.
     Concerning the current state of Japanese FOG technology, the
analyst said that he is not aware of any working fiber gyroscopes
in Japan today.  He said that the Japanese are concentrating
their efforts on the production base to build the material for
FOG and added that "devices will come next."
     Industry officials in the United States whose firms are
developing fiber gyros have told MFON in the past that the
military currently represents the most likely near term market
for the FOG technology.  However, these sources say the military
has not expressed any commitment toward buying this technology
and express concern that any applications for it may be years off
if the military does not move to procure FOGs soon.
     Asked about U.S. industry's concerns here, McHale pointed
out that Japanese firms, through the help of MITI, will find the
necessary economic base for fiber gyros by applying them in as
many product lines as possible.  He said the Japanese will build
small and inexpensive FOGs for automobiles, trucks, police and
emergency vehicles as well as for other vehicles and vessels.
For such applications, he said, the gyros would serve stability
and control and navigation functions.
     The problem, McHale said, is not in the U.S. labs, it is how
to get the technology out of the laboratory.  "The Japanese lab
work has duplicated a lot of what we do.  So when we drop out
because there is no short-term profit, the Japanese will pick up
where we leave off.  They are in it for the long-term," he
concluded.

DOD `TREMENDOUS NEED' FOR TACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FIBER, NEW
STUDY SAYS

     Companies involved with the development and manufacture of
fiber optic technology that do not anticipate entering the
telecommunications market will find a significant military market
for the tactical development of fiber optic technology, a
recently released study entitled "Fiber Optics in the Military
and Communications Markets" says.
     Prepared by S&W Associates of Bethesda, Md., the study
forecasts sea-based fiber optic applications increasing from $10
million last year to about $72 million in 1994.
     And S&W predicts a six-fold increase in the growth rate for
fiber optic avionics applications between 1989 and 1994.
Specifically, the study sees these applications, such as fiber
optic flight controls and high-speed data buses, either in new
weapons systems or as upgrades to existing platforms in each of
four military services.
     Electronic Warfare, command, control, communication and
intelligence (C3I) and navigation are areas seen in the study
that will be receiving funding emphasis within the mililtary.
     Taking into account that the Defense Department faces
budgets with "very little, if any, real growth," S&W notes
several other economic considerations impacting future market
growth for fiber in the military.  Because a lot of DoD money is
tied up in existing contracts, the study says opportunities to
employ fiber optics and related components either in new weapons
systems or to modernize existing ones, "will require demonstrated
capabilities and/or greater investment with a higher degree of
risk in regard to an adequate return on the investment."
     Concerning spending trends within DoD on fiber optic
technologies that are already being used, "priority interest" is
projected for the following:  "Wide bandwidth distributed
information and image processing; secure, TEMPEST certified LANs
and related processing systems; and, modernization of base
telecommunications systems."
     The Bethesda-based analysts see even more intense
competition ahead within the military fiber optic market due to a
slowdown in the commercial market and because "defense
contractors will be compelled to exploit future fiber optic
technology by finding not only the highest quality system
components at a reasonable cost but also by foreseeing and
satisfying requirements arising from ongoing military efforts."
And the study foresees the cost of replacing copper cable with
fiber cable on existing systems as potentially prohibitive.  (The
report sells for $995.  For more information or to order, contact
Phillips Publishing, Inc., 7811 Montrose Road, Potomac, MD 20854,

AWA DEMONSTRATES MILNET FOR FDDI DEFENSE APPLICATIONS

     The Australian firm AWA Defence & Aerospace recently
demonstrated MILNET, a high-capacity image, voice, data and
sensor network for local area communications applications, for a
variety of defense applications, the company has announced.
     MILNET is compliant with the Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (FDDI) Standard and supports both FDDI-I and FDDI-II
modes of operation.  Some of its potential applications include
ground/shipboard command and control, fixed/tactical voice and
data communications, shipboard internal/external communications,
air defense/ATC radar and communications, sonar/radar/optronic
sensor systems, secure building/base communications and
administrative backbone networks.
     The defense electronics company demonstrated its FDDI local
area network (LAN) technology at the Australian Industry &
Defence Exhibition held at the end of November.  According to the
company, the "demonstration consisted of two Backbone Nodes
interconnected by standard multimode fiber cable.  High-
resolution screen graphics were transferred between two
workstations connected to the Nodes.  Integrated Service Digital
Network communications between two Intercom stations attached to
the Nodes was also demonstrated."
     AWA expects release of the commercial variant of MILNET,
known as MERLAN, late this year, with MILNET going on the market
shortly thereafter, a company official said.  (AWA Defence &
Aerospace, 422 Lane Cove Road, North Ryde, Sydney NSW, 2113
Australia.  Phone: 61 (02) 887-7111.  In the U.S. call 203/377-
1252.)

BELL `DISAPPOINTED' OVER MISSING AF GYRO WORKSHOP

     A Bell Aerospace Textron official expressed "disappointment"
at not being invited to a mid-December Air Force workshop that
was called to get a snapshot of the current technology status of
fiber optic gyroscopes and of a micro-optic gyro for use in
tactical missiles and projectiles (MFON, Dec. 15, 1989).  "I feel
we should have been there," he told MFON, after saying his
company was not made aware of the workshop.
     Bell entered the fiber optic gyro (FOG) market in September
after the company signed a series of agreements with Standard
Elektrik Lorenz (SEL) of West Germany "to develop, market, and
team on programs which use the latest FOG technology" (MFON,
Sept. 22, 1989).  At the time, Bell officials said the agreements
represent the "first known commitment of FOG technology to the
production floor."
     The official noted that "the Air Force may have left us out
of the workshop because they were not aware that we are a new
player in the [FOG] game."  He pointed out that because SEL is a
foreign company, it is possible the Air Force did not realize
that the firm had a FOG.  "We are currently marketing our gyro in
the U.S." the official said, adding, "We expect to do well in
this country with the technology."  (Bell Aerospace Textron, PO
Box One, Buffalo, NY 14240, 716/298-6932.)
