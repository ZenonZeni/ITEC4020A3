<LI><H2>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers selects Isis&#174;</H2>
Triton Technology has delivered another Isis system to the 
<A HREF="http://www.orl.usace.army.mil/"><B>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</B></A>.
Current interfaces include the 
<A HREF="http://www.reson.com/"><B>Reson</B></A> SeaBat 9001 and 9002 systems 
as well as the Odom Echoscan, which take advantage of the new Isis Multibeam Digital 
Interface Module developed to log and display co-located bathymetry and imagery.
 
Following six at-sea tests with the SeaBat 9001, Triton delivered Isis with the Multibeam interface to  
both the Detroit and Louisville Districts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for shallow water survey 
operations. Both systems were delivered in conjunction with the Reson SeaBat 9001.  Richard Lear, 
General Manager of Reson UK said, Isis complements the SeaBat by its ability to display and combine 
both the bathymetry and imagery from the profiler.  Isis can overlay a backscatter intensity value for 
each of the 60 beams or the actual sidescan information on top of the 3-D bathymetry display.
<p>
<LI><H2>Isis selected as topside for 
<A HREF="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/noaa.html"><B>NOAA</B></A>'s Focused Multibeam Sidescan Systems</H2>
NOAA recently awarded a contract  to Klein Associates for a high-speed, high-resolution, focused 
multibeam side scan sonar. Triton’s Isis was selected as the topside processor for the system. NOAA 
expects to order up to eleven systems over five years. The first delivery is scheduled for June 96.  
Isis was selected for its ability to acquire, digitize, process, display in  real-time, and store  high-
resolution imagery. Isis leads the industry with  state-of-the-art features that include: virtual resolution; Windows 95 and NT operating systems; and high-speed hardware that allows data to be played back as fast as the eye can see.   
Other outstanding Isis features include: signal/pixel processing with selectable downsampling methods to 
fit the application; image analysis with logging to disk; and user interface with comprehensive On-Line 
Help.
<p>
<LI><H2>New Isis Modules and Features</H2>
<UL>
<LI><H3>TriPort data converter</H3>
TriPort Ver.1.0, was released in January, 1995, enabling Isis and Q-MIPS Users to convert imagery 
stored as .DAT files to a format compatible with most popular GIS and word processing packages.  
TriPort runs under Windows 3.1, 95 and NT. 
<p>
<LI><H3>Digital SLS Interfaces</H3>
Triton has added digital interfaces for several more digital sidescan systems.  Current digital interfaces 
include the Klein System-2000, EG&G DF-1000 and the Datasonics SIS-1000 systems.  Other digital 
interfaces require only that a digital server and hardware interface be developed. Contact the Sales 
department for pricing information. 
<p>
<LI><H3>Auto Freespan Detection</H3>
A new module for automatically detecting and logging pipeline freespans has been developed and 
implemented in Isis for offshore pipeline survey operations.  The new module was developed by Triton 
and tested by Stolt Comex Seaway in Haugesund, Norway. Using imagery from a sidescan sonar, the new 
module will display and log a freespan’s start and stop location. The new package is also capable of 
tracking up to four pipelines simultaneously in both real- and post-time as well as displaying the span 
information and a maximum span length and height detected.  
<p>
<LI><H3>Graph</H3>
Triton has added the new graphing capability to Isis as standard (provided free to Users with current 
EMA or warranty). The graph feature allows the User to graph all attitude, navigation, CTD and most any 
other sensor data as a function of time. 
 
The advantage of the graph feature is the ability to monitor data quality in real-time and to aid in the 
calibration of various sensors.  The User controls the time intervals for the display windows and Isis 
displays an average value for each display (e.g. trim, list, etc.). 
<p> 
<LI><H3>32-bit version of Isis</H3>
Triton has just released a 32-bit version of Isis capable of running under both Windows 95 and NT.  The 
32-bit upgrade was included with the latest 16-bit upgrade version that all Isis Users under EMA received 
in early December. 
Users interested in upgrading to 32-bit Isis are required to purchase a copy of either Windows 95 or NT.  
Triton currently recommends Windows 95 because of the better User interface and 2K x 2K virtual 
resolution. 
<p>
<LI><H3>Interface to Seatex MRU</H3>
For Isis users incorporating a motion reference unit in their system, Triton has developed a two-way 
interface to the Seatex range of MRU's.  The new interface requires only that a serial connection be made 
between Isis and the MRU and Isis will automatically configure itself to extract only the required attitude 
information. Contact Clark Friesen at Seatex, Inc. at (206) 836-8021.

<H2>Technical Trends at Triton Technology, Inc.</H2>

Happy New Year! 
In keeping with the new year, Triton's technical manuals are “turning over a new leaf” and  taking on a 
cleaner look. As a taste of things to come,   Triton's newest manuals now feature: 
<UL>
<LI>More graphics 
<LI>Chapter-driven tables of contents 
<LI>Chapter-driven indexes 
<LI>The new format will make it easier and faster for you to find help in the manuals. 
<LI>Soon you will be able to access more of our documentation on-line.  
</UL>    
We are experimenting with a product called FrameViewer, which lets you browse our 
manuals on-line. With it you can read and print information that interests you. 
One of the main benefits of the on-line version of the new manuals is that when you click on a table of 
contents or index entry, the on-line system takes you directly to the subject in the manual. We hope this 
on-line approach will cut down on the time it takes you to find the information you need most. 
New users' manuals for Isis and Vista for Windows 95 and NT are now available.  
 
For those of you who still prefer technical information from traditional hardcopy, Triton will continue to 
offer it to you that way. Extra manuals in the form of hardcopy are available at $25/copy.

<H2>Isis F.A.Q.'s</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Q.  How can an Isis User tell if the sonar is triggering?
<DT>A.  There is an LED light located on the front of the Signal Interface Unit (SIU-4) that should be blinking 
in time with the received trigger.
<p>
<DT>Q.  How can I troubleshoot the cause of no imagery displayed in Isis after a recording session has been 
initiated? 
<DT>A.  Open a voltage window under the main menu item WINDOW, VOLTAGE, SIGNAL.  If there is a 
signal coming across, imagery will be generated.  Make sure that the Threshold setting is appropriate for 
the signal that is being received.  If the signal is low, adjust the THRESHOLD slide bar so that imagery  
is visible. 
If you do not see a signal in the Isis voltage window, make sure that the SIU4 unit has a blinking light.  If 
so, check the 5BNC connectors coming from the sonar into the SIU4 and the DB-37 connector that plugs 
into the back of Isis. 
Restart Isis after all connections have been checked.  If recording is still unsuccessful, hook up an 
oscilloscope to the sonar's outputs to check the signal.  
If the signal from the sonar is correct, hook the scope to the output channels of the SIU4 to verify that 
signals are being output. 
<p> 
<DT>Q.  What are the most common causes of failure of the Magneto-Optical drives? 
<DT>A.  Overheating and dirt.  To maintain the proper temperature inside the Isis chassis, the User should 
clean the filters located on the front and back of Isis.  Keeping these filters clean allows for proper air 
circulation.  M-O drives put out a great amount of heat and require clean filters to maintain the needed air 
flow. 
<p> 
<DT>Q.  What should be done if an optical drive in Isis suddenly stops working? 
<DT>A.  Shut down Isis and let it cool.  Allow enough time so the M-O drive cools down completely.  Check 
and clean your air filters while Isis is off.  Restart the computer and, while it is booting, look at the M-O 
drive.  A light on the far left should blink 5 to 7 times (depending on the operating system).  If the light 
on the right goes on, and stays on, your drive needs to be returned for repair. 
<p>
<DT>Q.  Before I go out on my  survey, I need to estimate the amount of disk space (or magneto-optical space) 
I should reserve for my data in Isis or Q-MIPS. How do I do that? 
<DT>A.  The key variable to measure is the number of bytes per ping that will be “used” during your survey. 
Bytes per ping depend on the following factors: 
<UL>
<LI>How many samples per channel are specified to be stored for each ping
<LI>Whether each pixel captured by a ping will represent 16 bits or 8 bits of data 
<LI>Whether you will be saving both raw and corrected imagery, or just one or the other (Q-MIPS only) 
<LI>How many channels will be operating during the data survey 
<LI>The operational length of time of your data survey 
</UL>
Refer to page B-2 and the equations on page B-3 of the Isis User's Manual for a comprehensive 
discussion on this issue. 
<p>
<DT>Q.  When do you plan to release the Windows version of VISTA Mosaic? 
<DT>A.  An advance version of Vista for Windows 95 and NT will be released to selected Users and Triton 
Distributors and Reps  in January 1996. 
<p>
The Beta program for VISTA for Windows was a success over the last year and we expect to iron out any 
remaining issues over the next month.  The first release of the program will be February 1, 1996.   
Please contact the sales department to get more information or to get a preliminary copy of VISTA.
