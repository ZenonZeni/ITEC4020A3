<title>Cutting Carbon Dioxide Emissions Can 
Add to U.S. Prosperity</title>

<H2><I>D. </I>Successes Demonstrate That Cutting Carbon Dioxide Emissions Can 
Add to U.S. Prosperity</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
This report documents how U.S. businesses and individuals are increasing 
their bottom lines while improving economic prosperity, employment, and 
public health - and cutting greenhouse emissions.<BR>
<BR>
 <p>     <B>
<H3>Chapter I</H3>
</B> reviews energy-efficiency success stories in 
the industrial sector, stories that demonstrate how companies that set out 
to cut electricity bills also improved worker productivity and became more 
competitive.<BR>
 <p>     <B>
<H3>Chapter II</H3>
</B> assesses a wide array of energy-saving 
electric utility programs and federal energy-efficiency programs that have 
saved the U.S. economy billions of dollars.<BR>
 <p>     <B>
<H3>Chapter III</H3>
</B> reviews gains in the energy-efficient design 
of commercial buildings and residences nationwide, and assesses ongoing 
innovations that could lead to improved building codes. It discusses 
commercial and residential energy-efficiency retrofit 
successes - including lighting upgrades - as well as efficiency 
gains in the design of appliances and equipment.<BR>
 <p>     <B>
<H3>Chapter IV</H3>
</B> reviews the transportation sector and the 
improvement in fuel efficiency over the last 20 years. It goes on to 
discuss how new automobile engines that are now available could double 
vehicle fuel efficiency, while electric and hybrid-electric 
vehicles - given incentives that would spur market 
development - could usher in a new age of clean transportation, powered 
by renewables-derived electricity.<BR>
 <p>     <B>
<H3>Chapter V</H3>
</B> reviews recent successes in renewable energy, 
including a drop in the cost per kilowatt-hour of wind, photovoltaic, 
solar thermal, and geothermal power. Wind can now compete head-to-head 
with fossil fuels.<BR>
<BR>
<p>     All of the successes reviewed in this report not only save dollars 
and add to U.S. economic strength, but also cut carbon dioxide emissions 
and reduce the threat of global climate change. Our nation can grow 
economically, add jobs, and become more internationally competitive while 
cutting greenhouse gas emissions. <BR>
<p>     The task ahead is not simple, however. While the market has captured 
many efficiency and renewable energy successes, a host of market barriers 
to efficiency investments persists.  For example, although efficiency and 
renewable energy technologies are often cheaper on a life-cycle basis, 
their up-front costs are typically higher than less-efficient products.  
Public policies that provide consumers with life-cycle product information 
could help overcome this market failure.  Similarly, because it takes 
up-front capital to invest in improved efficiency, public policies that 
promote financing and technical assistance can facilitate investment.  
Although the focus of this report is on efficiency and renewable energy 
success stories, given the market hurdles to efficiency investments, 
utility efficiency programs and public policy incentives are crucial to 
encourage energy efficiency.  The effects of tighter environmental 
regulations and the prospect of higher energy prices will increasingly 
make efficiency investments a prudent pursuit for all businesses.<BR>
<p>     Michael Porter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, notes 
that "the underlying cause of sustained national advantage is improvement 
and innovation."<a href="#17" name="r17"> [ 17 ] </a>The following case studies -  coupled with the solid 
economic, employment, public health and pollution-reduction benefits 
reviewed in each - establish the need for a strategic vision for U.S. 
energy policy: energy efficiency and renewable energy can add to U.S. 
prosperity while cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, reducing the 
threat of global climate change.
