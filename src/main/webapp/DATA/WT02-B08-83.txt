<H1>Melbourne welcomes XXth CINP Congress<BR>
</H1>
Dear delegates,<BR>
On behalf of the Local Organising Committee, I extend to each of you a personal
welcome to the XXth Congress of the Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum
(CINP) in Melbourne, 23&shyp;27 June 1996.<BR>
<BR>
The Local Organising Committee has put together a complete programme of
symposia, scientific sessions, keynote lectures and other workshops to bring
together the world's most renowned researchers and clinicians. We have worked
with the International Committee and the Scientific Committee to ensure
an exciting and valuable scientific programme supported by national and
international participants. <BR>
<BR>
The Conifer system, available on screens throughout the Congress Centre,
allows delegates to individually tailor their XXth CINP Congress programme.
Category II CME points are also available for US doctors by recording the
amount of time spent at the XXth CINP Congress and claiming informal hours
on your Annual CME Reporting Form, including the congress name, location
and dates.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time the Local Organising Committee has worked to provide a
large range of social and cultural activities that will introduce you to
Australia &shyp; the people, the flora and fauna and the rich diversity
of our multicultural nation. Of all our cities, Melbourne provides the best
our country can offer in hospitality, fine food, wine, the arts and sport.
Further afield, you may also have the opportunity to sample other wonders
of Australia such as the Great Barrier Reef, Central Australia or other
states.<BR>
<BR>
The Local Organising Committee will keep delegates up-to-date via the late
announcements that will appear on the last page of each issue of this daily
newspaper.<BR>
Join with us, the members of the Local Organising Committee, the President
and officers of the CINP and experience a wonderful Congress and all the
best our country has to offer. 
<H3>Professor Graham Burrows AO, </H3>
KSJ, MD, FRANZCP<BR>
Chairman, Local Organising Committee<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
<H1>Welcome to the XXth CINP Congress<BR>
</H1>
Distinguished guests, dear colleagues,<BR>
On behalf of the International College of Neuro-Psycho-pharmacology (CINP),
I am very pleased to extend a warm welcome to all of the participants in
the XXth CINP Congress. In their wisdom, the founders of CINP made the decision
to hold a scientific congress every 2 years. As a result, the biennial CINP
Congress is a very important scientific event in international neuroscience
and neuropsychopharmacology, and an event we all look forward to.<BR>
<BR>
This is the first CINP Congress held in this region of the world, and Graham
Burrows and his National and Local Organising Committees have worked hard
for more than 2 years to organise an outstanding Congress in this beautiful
city of Melbourne &shyp; designated as one of the world's most liveable
cities. People from &quot;down under&quot; are noted for their openness,
warmth and hospitality and Graham and his group have made sure that the
organisation of the XXth Congress, its social events and its venues, are
&quot;user friendly&quot; and that a warm and amiable spirit will pervade
this meeting.<BR>
The most memorable aspects of an international scientific meeting like this
are the social interactions with colleagues &shyp; it is a unique opportunity
to make new friends and renew old friendships with scientific colleagues
from over 50 different countries throughout the world. I know you will all
take advantage of this unusual opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
We take great pride in the scientific programme you will be offered at the
XXth CINP Congress. The science conducted by CINP members and their colleagues
is the best of its kind. The general focus of all our research efforts is
to improve understanding of the brain's function in health and disease and
how, specifically, psycho-pharmacological medications work in the brain
to ameliorate and treat mental and neurological disorders and diseases of
ageing.<BR>
<BR>
It is fitting that the XIXth CINP Congress in Washington and now the XXth
Congress here in Melbourne are held during the Decade of the Brain. The
Decade of the Brain began under the US Federal Government, with a Presidential
Proclamation in 1990, during the time I directed the National Institute
of Mental Health. It has now spread to the 11 member nations of the European
community and Switzerland, as well as to many sovereign nations that are
now in the process of developing their own Decade of the Brain efforts as
well. The goal of a worldwide Decade of the Brain is a foreseeable reality
in the future. I am pleased that CINP, beginning with past President Giorgio
Racagni, and continuing during my 2 years as President, has played an important
leadership role in the international Decade of the Brain and I am sure that
the incoming President, Claude de Montigny, will continue this during his
2-year tenure. <BR>
<BR>
The scientific programme which you will enjoy, learn from and add to as
of tomorrow, has been carefully crafted by the International Scientific
Programme Committee to include cutting edge basic and clinical research
that is highly relevant to the understanding and management of the full
spectrum of brain disorders. It includes over 80 scientific symposia, five
scientific plenary addresses including the Presidential Address, 11 official
satellite meetings and 472 poster presentations. Great care was taken to
have an appropriate balance between clinical and basic research and to ensure
that, at all times, there is something of interest available for the basic
scientist, the clinical scientist and the clinician. We believe that this
will prove to be a CINP Congress second to none in its science and social
events &shyp; please enjoy yourself. I look forward to seeing and greeting
you personally during the next 5 days at the XXth CINP Congress.<BR>
<BR>
Lewis L Judd, MD, President, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharma-cologicum
will be presenting the inaugural CINP Presidential Address New observations
in the life course of unipolar major depression: risk factors and treatment
goals in the John Batman Theatre at 0830 today. <BR>

<H1>Premier Of Victoria welcomes delegates of the XXth CINP Congress<BR>
</H1>
It is with great pleasure that I extend a warm and enthusiastic welcome
to all delegates of the XXth CINP Congress on behalf of the people of Melbourne
&shyp; the world's most liveable city.<BR>
This internationally significant forum is being held in Australia for the
first time and we are delighted that Melbourne has been chosen to host such
a prestigious meeting of minds.<BR>
Not only does this reflect well on our reputation as a centre of excellence
in medical research, it is also a vote of confidence in this city's ability
to play host to notable events.<BR>
While I understand that your focus over the next four days will be on contributing
to a greater understanding of the brain's functions and how we can better
treat mental disorders, I would also urge the many visitors from overseas
and interstate to take some time to enjoy the pleasures of Melbourne.<BR>
We have plenty of sporting and cultural activities, challenging golf courses,
beautiful parks and relaxing restaurants on hand to ensure that your minds
remain fresh for these vital deliberations.<BR>
On behalf of all Victorians I wish you well in your endeavours over the
next four days.<BR>

<H1>Lithium, Melbourne and John Cade, AO &shyp; from serendipity to serenity<BR>
</H1>
John Cade (1912&shyp;1980) placed lithium and Melbourne on the international
map of psychiatry. Despite the fact that lithium use was unpopular in the
late 1940s, he discovered that lithium calmed the &quot;psychotic excitement&quot;
of some patients with psychiatric illness.<BR>
Although the publication of his findings in the Medical Journal of Australia
in 1949 created only a ripple in the academic world of the day, he nevertheless
founded the basis of contemporary treatment of bipolar disorders with lithium.
From that time, his discoveries led Melbourne psychiatrists to use lithium
routinely, even though the international community of psychiatrists took
some time to endorse its use.<BR>
At the time, lithium was being used as a convenient cation to prevent crystallisation
of urate used to test the toxicity of urine from manic patients after being
injected into rats. John Cade found that lithium urate induced profound
docility in rats during experiments he performed at the now decommissioned
Repatriation Mental Hospital in Bundoora in suburban Melbourne. He pursued
his belief in this observation, and demonstrated that lithium, not urate,
was the psychoactive agent. After self-administering without mishap, he
proceeded to find that lithium induced a similar effect in patients with
&quot;psychotic excitement&quot;.<BR>
Family and friends knew John Cade as a modest and gentle man whose passion
for observing nature flowed into his work as a clinician. He is remembered
as a man who harnessed the power of true observation, and whom Melbourne
can thank for its place in the history of psychiatry.<BR>
The CINP local organising committee wishes to acknowledge Professor Edmond
Chiu and John Cade's son for assistance with this story.<BR>
<BR>
In honour of John Cade's discovery, the John Cade symposium on lithium:
Parts 1 and 2 is on Tuesday, 25 June in room B4 at 0830&shyp;1100 and 1330&shyp;1600.

<H1>HIV-related neuropsychiatric disorders: early diagnosis is the key to
treatment</H1>
<H3></H3>
<I>Monday symposium: NeuroAIDS I: animal models and mechan-isms, and NeuroAIDS
II: diagnosis, neuropathology and emerging treatments.</I><BR>
<BR>
Major depressive disorders affect 20% of HIV-infected patients, according
to Dr Glenn Treisman from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science,
John Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA. The high prevalence of adjustment
disorders, cognitive impairment, substance-use disorders and mania (8%)
reflect the diversity of presentations confounding the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric
disorders of people with HIV infection. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
shows a 1.5&shyp;2.0-fold increase in depression as AIDS progresses. AIDS
mania may have specific distinguishing characteristics from bipolar mania.<BR>
<BR>
Affective disorders associated with HIV respond to traditional pharmacological
agents, but care is required as HIV-infected patients are extremely sensitive
to side-effects and toxicities and may have altered pharmacodynamics. 
<H3>Diagnosis and early treatment of HIV-related cognitive impairment</H3>
Dr Bruce Brew from the Department of Neurology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney,
reports that AIDS dementia complex (ADC), a subcortical AIDS-related dementia,
mainly occurs in advanced HIV disease, and points out that other factors
predict its development (refer to box). ADC responds to zidovudine, although
high doses may be required.<BR>
<BR>
Ian Everall from the Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill, London, UK,
reports that neuronal loss is limited to the symptomatic stage of disease
and seems to be related to the viral load in the brain. The pattern of neuronal
loss appears to be selective, and the mechanism of this loss is not related
to direct infection with HIV.<BR>
<BR>
While dementia is rare in asymptomatic HIV infection, neuropsychological
impairment may occur in as many as one-third of cases, according to Dr Igor
Grant from the Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego,
USA. This subtle, cognitive impairment has quality-of-life implications
&shyp; including a higher likelihood of unemployment &shyp; highlighting
the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.<BR>
<BR>
This early impact of HIV on the CNS is reinforced by a preliminary analysis
of NMR spectroscopy (NMRS) in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count below
20%. George Fein from the University of California and Veteran Affairs Medical
Center, San Francisco, USA, reports that patients may demonstrate NMRS changes
with low CD4 counts consistent with mild CNS changes before frank neurocognitive
impairments are present.<BR>
<BR>
Floyd Bloom from the Department of Neuropharmacology, the Scripps Research
Institute, La Jolla, USA, says that the ability to correlate measurable
behavioural effects with neuropathological abnormalities is an important
feature of animal models and has been demonstrated to date in <BR>
murine, feline and simian animal models.<BR>
<BR>
The symposium NeuroAIDS I: animal models and mechanisms is in room <BR>
B7 at 1000&shyp;1230, followed at 1330&shyp;1600 by NeuroAIDS II: diagnosis,
neuropathology and emerging treatments in room B7.

<H1>Towards a cholinergic model of Alzheimer's disease</H1>
<H2></H2>
<I>Monday symposium: Molecular strategies for Alzheimer's: Parts 1 and 2.<BR>
</I><BR>
Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial and has a poorly understood
aetiology, contemporary methods are breaking new ground in the identification
and testing of therapeutic drugs for AD. <BR>
<BR>
Dr A Unterbeck from the Institute for Dementia Research, Bayer Corporation,
West Haven CT, USA, believes that these new molecular procedures will allow
the identification of agents specifically designed to target AD at the molecular
level. Unfortunately, research to date has been hampered by the absence
of a suitable animal model and the inability to diagnose AD reliably.<BR>
Disruption to the central cholinergic system closely approximates the cognitive
decline characteristic of AD, according to Dr Keith Wesnes from Cognitive
Drug Research, Beech Hill, Reading, UK. Even though AD patients have pathological
tissue changes in the CNS, their anterograde episodic memory deficit is
widely accepted to be due to cholinergic &shyp; and therefore chemical &shyp;
dysfunction. New evidence from a large multicentre trial demonstrates that
AD patients also have severe attention disorders directly related in magnitude
to disease severity. Comparison of these deficits to cholinergic blockade
is being undertaken in order to identify any potential cholinergic mechanism.<BR>
In the discussion of muscarinic partial agonists in the symptomatic treatment
of patients with AD, Dr Kumar from SmithKline Beecham Pharm-aceuticals,
New Frontiers Science Park, Essex, UK, will detail the novel agent, SB 202026,
which possesses functional selectivity at central muscarinic type 1 (M1)
receptors, with lower activity at central and peripheral M2 and M3 receptors.
SB 202026 induces cognition-enhancing effects in animals at low doses where
side-effects are not problematic and is well tolerated in patients at therapeutic
doses. Muscarinic partial agonists which are selective for M1 receptors
may soon provide efficacy in patients with AD without the side-effects which
hamper the use of poorly-selective full agonists.<BR>
<BR>
Other areas of discussion during the AD sessions will include the role of
amyloid in the aetiology of AD, the role of serotonin in the abnormal, non-cognitive
behaviour of AD patients, and the role of GABA-B receptors in memory formation.<BR>
<BR>
The symposium Molecular strategies for Alzheimer's: Parts 1 and 2 is in
Bellarine 3 today. Part 1 is from 1000&shyp;1230 and Part 2 is from 1330&shyp;1600.

<H1>What is the best pharmacological treatment following response to ECT?
</H1>
<H2></H2>
<I>Monday symposium: ECT: advances in basic and clinical research.<BR>
</I><BR>
Dr Harold Sackeim of the New York State Psychiatric Institute presents new
data from multicentre trials examining the use of medication following response
to ECT.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The most common treatment to prevent relapse following response to
ECT is pharmaco-therapy with antidepressants. We also need to know whether
medication resistance also impacts upon the response to ECT&quot;, reports
Dr Sackeim. &quot;These issues are of paramount clinical concern.&quot;
<H3>EEGs and ECT</H3>
Relationships between EEG indices and treatment outcomes may be useful in
the understanding of the neuro-biological mechanisms of action of ECT. Dr
Richard D Weiner from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science,
Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA, attempts to
characterise these relationships using data from three separate studies
that include quantitative assessment prior to, and shortly after, an ECT
course in patients treated for major depression. 
<H3>Does blood pressure always increase after an ECT seizure? </H3>
An unexpected finding of continuous blood pressure monitoring during ECT,
using the new technique of finger cuff plethysmography, is that an increase
in blood pressure does not always follow ECT-induced seizures. As ECT is
thought to elevate plasma catecholamines initially, resulting in an increase
in blood pressure, David Nutt from the Psychopharmacology Unit, School of
Medical Sciences, Bristol, UK, discusses the implications of the effect
of ECT on plasma catecholamines.<BR>
<BR>
Other topics discussed at this symposium include an increase in the expression
of 5-HT1A receptors after ECT, and an increase in neuropeptide Y levels
following ECT. <BR>
<BR>
The symposium ECT: advances in basic and clinical research is in room B4
at 1000&shyp;1230 today. <BR>
