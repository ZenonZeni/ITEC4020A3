<h2>Chapter Six: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco in the Drug
Legalization Debate </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p>I. <b>Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of drug legalization advance the argument that to
the extent alcohol and tobacco may be freely consumed, it is
hypocritical to make other drugs such as marijuana and cocaine
illegal. They cite the individual and social harm caused by both
tobacco and alcohol to support their argument. </p>

<p><b>II. Our</b> <b>Argument</b> </p>

<p>Two responses immediately come to mind when addressing the
legalizers' argument. First, simply because we have as a society
have chosen to legalize some dangerous substances does not lead
to the conclusion that we should legalize all dangerous
substances. Second, the legalizers' argument is logically flawed:
When they compare the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco to
that caused by drugs such as cocaine and marijuana they are
comparing apples and oranges (or more specifically, legal to
illegal drugs). Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and, according to
our analysis in Chapter One [Addiction Rates], are used much more
frequently than illegal drugs. Because their use is greater, the
amount of damage they cause will also be greater. But this is not
to say that one &quot;dose&quot; of alcohol is inherently more
dangerous than one &quot;dose&quot; of cocaine. As James Q.
Wilson explains, predictions about the harms of cocaine that
assume its illegality tells us little about what damage cocaine
would do if it were legal.111 Thus, the proper analysis is not to
compare damage caused by cocaine to that caused by alcohol under
the present system, but instead is to compare the harm likely
caused by <i>legalized </i>cocaine to that caused by alcohol. </p>

<p>But let us look more closely at the legalizers' position
itself. </p>

<p><b>1. Tobacco.</b> Certainly tobacco kills people.
Nonetheless, it is disingenuous to say that as such it is a more
dangerous substance than either cocaine or marijuana. For while
it may harm one's health, tobacco does not affect one's
intellectual processing or decision-making ability. As Professor
Wilson explains: </p>

<p>Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it.<b> </b>Nicotine
alters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul. The heavy use of
crack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes those natural
sentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our human nature
and make possible our social life.&quot;' </p>

<p>Think of it this way: Research fairly convincingly has
demonstrated that cholesterol is bad for people, and in fact may
be responsible for a large amount of heart disease in the United
States. In essence, cholesterol kills. But to take this premise
and then argue that because we allow people to eat red meat we
should also allow them to smoke crack is both unsophisticated and
unpersuasive reasoning. Similarly, to argue that because we do
not allow people to smoke crack we should not allow them to eat
red meat also displays a rather monumental lack of common sense.
And although cholesterol may kill you, it does not lead to the
types of bizarre, destructive behavior that is associated with
most illegal drugs. </p>

<p>2. <b>Alcohol. </b>Alcohol is somewhat harder to justify, for
not only can it kill people but it does in fact alter one's
behavior and may encourage antisocial and destructive activity.
But again, this admission does not me-an that one must view
alcohol and cocaine as equivalent. First, a far greater
percentage of people who use cocaine become addicted to the
substance than do people who use alcohol. Recall that in Chapter
One, we discovered that the addiction rate for cocaine may be as
high as 75%.113 Conversely, the addiction rate for alcohol is
about 10%.114 One<b> </b>is thus far more likely to become
addicted to cocaine than to alcohol. Second, the relapse rate
(the percentage of people who quit the drug who later begin to
take it again), is much higher for cocaine.115 </p>

<p>In short, do not let proponents of legalization argue that
just because tobacco and alcohol are legal, so too should be
cocaine and marijuana. First, just because we sanction some
dangerous substances does not mean that we should allow all of
them. Second, it is misleading to compare the damage caused by
legal drugs with that caused by illegal drugs -- instead we
should compare the risks of alcohol and tobacco with those of <i>legalized
</i>cocaine and marijuana. Likely we would find that the latter
are much more dangerous than the former. </p>

<p>Third, tobacco does not alter one's behavior and encourage
violent behavior as do many illegal drugs. Fourth, alcohol, while
admittedly dangerous, is much less addictive than presently
illegal drugs and also is easier to quit once addicted. Do not
compound problems simply because they are difficult to solve-keep
illegal drugs illegal and at the same time try to discourage
alcohol and tobacco use. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If
they say...</b> </p>

<p>Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, marijuana and cocaine
should also be legal. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>Just because some dangerous substances are legal does not mean
that all dangerous substances should also be legal. </p>

<p>One cannot properly compare the harm associated with tobacco
and alcohol use with the harm associated with cocaine and
marijuana use, because you are comparing legal drugs with illegal
drugs. And as discussed in Chapter One, legalizing a drug makes
it more dangerous. (See last paragraph, page 7). </p>

<p>Although tobacco harms one's health, it does not alter one's
mental processes, nor does it create bizarre, violent behavior.
[James Q. Wilson, &quot;Against the Legalization of Drugs,&quot;
Commentary, February 1990]. </p>

<p>Although alcohol is harmful, it is much less addictive than
cocaine: Studies suggest that alcohol has an addiction rate of
10%, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75%.
[George Church. &quot;Thinking<b> </b>the Unthinkable,&quot;'
Time, May 30, 1988]. </p>

<p>Do not legalize drugs because alcohol and tobacco are harmful:
keep illegal drugs illegal and try to decrease use of the others.
