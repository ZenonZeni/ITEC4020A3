<p><font size="5">Holding the line between pursuit and punishment</font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>San Jose Mercury News </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>April 7, 1996<br>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The police officers who beat Rodney King have
recently been released from jail, yet, once again, the world is
being sickened by videotaped pictures of uniformed American
police officers savagely beating unresisting people.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Last week, television cameras caught Riverside
deputy sheriffs swinging their batons in rage against a man and
woman who had led them on a high-speed chase while driving a
truck full of suspected illegal aliens.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A week earlier in a suburb of Los Angeles,
police shot and killed the driver of a vehicle after he tried to
elude them and drove at plainclothes officers brandishing their
guns. In South Carolina, an officer actually used his police
car's video equipment to record himself using unnecessary force
against a woman motorist.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These, and similar cases raise troubling
questions. How much police brutality occurs that isn't recorded?
Is it directed primarily against minorities because of police
racism? Is there something special about high speed chases?
Finally, do police departments have appropriate policies on the
use of force?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Immediately after the Rodney King incident the
police chief of Los Angeles labeled the incident an
&quot;aberration.&quot; However, this view was contradicted by
many citizens and groups who complained that brutal treatment by
the LAPD was the norm not the exception.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Christopher Commission, appointed by the
mayor and city council, criticized the department for allowing
racist comments, failing to adequately receive and investigate
complaints of unnecessary force by the police, and not
controlling a number of officers who had received an unusually
large number of complaints.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A Los Angeles officer told the commission that
the use of questionable force against suspects did not violate
the department' s value system. On the whole, allegations of
routine brutality by the LAPD seemed more valid than the chief's
claim of an aberration,</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But, recent cases of police brutality involve
different police departments spread across the nation.
Frequently, a high-speed chase triggers the encounter and
usually, although not always, the victim of the police batons is
a member of a minority group. Only one thing is certain. The
percentage of people of minority background who believe that the
police are racist and brutal is much higher than in white
America. The same disparities in trust among races showed in
polls concerning the guilt or innocence of OJ Simpson and general
fairness of the criminal justice system. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The chase<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I remember what it was like to be behind the
wheel of a police car and involved in a high-speed chase. The
fleeing vehicle ignores your-emergency lights and siren, drives
recklessly, creating great danger for innocent people as well as
pursuing cops. It is the ultimate disrespect for your authority
as a police officer</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Everyone except a few weird militia groupies
accept the authority of the police to regulate traffic. So, it
begins to build in your, mind that this person driving so
recklessly must have done something terrible in addition to the
traffic violations he is accumulating with abandon. Your anger
grows into rage as the chase continues.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">However, we captured far more pathetic
motorists with expired drivers' licenses or kids on a joy ride
than armed robbers, Panic, not a hardened criminal mentality, led
to the wild flight.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nevertheless, every cop is well aware of that
every year more than a dozen police officers are fatally shot
while investigating people in motor vehicles. Police officers
need to be cautious while simultaneously taking decisive action
to arrest the suspect. This is the danger point. The furious
flailing of a baton becomes a release of anger, satisfying a need
to punish, rather than an application of necessary force to make
an arrest.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The law is quite clear. The police may use
reasonable force necessary to defend themselves or to make an
arrest. In the moment of encounter what may seem reasonable to an
officer may later be judged to have been excessive, yet this is
quite rare.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Society traditionally forgives an officer who
felt great danger when it later turns out to be absent.' However,
repeated heavy blows to unresisting prisoners on the ground can
hardly be excused in the name of self-defense.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Solutions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It seems to me that all police agencies need to
revisit their policies on the use of force. In my early days as a
New York police officer we were allowed to use batons for
self-defense, but not to bring about compliance. It is a subtle
but essential point.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most Western police departments allow officers
to hit suspects with batons for not obeying the officer's
directions to lie on the ground or assume some other search
posture even though the suspect has shown no aggression toward
the officer.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The problem, as we have seen too often on
videotape, is that people being hit with a club try to cover
themselves in order to escape injury which can lead to more blows
for not &quot;complying.&quot; It would be a rare individual who
took no evasive or defensive action under such punishment. And,
we must remember that they were pursued for minor violations, not
serious crimes 4n which an officer would be justified in fearing
that the suspects were armed. The amount of force must be weighed
against the seriousness of the suspected crime and the potential
danger to the officers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police agencies must vigorously train officers
to recognize that they are likely to be excited and angry in
chases and other arrest situations but as police officers they
must know how to control their emotions and how to stop other
cops who are losing control. After all, most of the people the
police arrest for criminal assaults and murders also felt that
their rage was justified.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, police departments must ensure
that supervisors respond and take charge of sensitive incidents.
The supervisors must be well trained in defusing anger among
their fellow workers. Some of the officers who got into trouble
seemed to have no sense that they had done anything wrong and
other officers standing around seemed not to know how to
intervene. Clearly, their departments had failed to make it clear
to these officers what policies they were expected to follow and
what consequences they would face if they broke the rules.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the end, police departments must convince
their officers that they are public servants acting in
partnership with the community to prevent crime. Despite the
pronouncements of politicians, cops are not soldiers in wars
against crime and drugs. There is no enemy for the police to
destroy. The job of cops is to enforce the law for our
protection. Those who are sworn to enforce the law are also sworn
to obey it. The overwhelming majority of cops deserve credit for
living by this code, but we must insist that they must do more to
weed out those who don't. </font></p>
