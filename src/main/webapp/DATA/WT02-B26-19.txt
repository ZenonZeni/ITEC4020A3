<H2>New Law Denies SSI, SSDI To Those With Alcoholism And Drug Addictions</H2>
<H4>by Dee Mukherjee, NAMI legal liaison</H4>
<hr>

	New legislation (P.L.104-121) stipulates that people disabled due to drug addiction or alcoholism (DAA) will be ineligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits and, therefore, Medicare and Medicaid coverage linked to SSDI and SSI. This legislation affects both those currently receiving benefits and those applying for them.  
<P>
	The new law applies to people whose "drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to their disability."  Those who qualify for SSDI or SSI benefits based on another disability will retain their eligibility.  
<P>
	This legislation applies immediately to any new or pending benefits claims, and individuals currently receiving disability benefits based on DAA will have their benefits terminated on January 1, 1997. Those now receiving benefits that will terminate because of the new DAA provisions will be notified; however, they may reapply to determine whether they have another disabling impairment that would make them eligible to receive SSDI or SSI benefits.  Individuals will also be able to appeal ineligibility determinations or termination of benefits.  
<P>
	The new law also requires those who are receiving SSDI or SSI benefits due to another disabling impairment and who also have a DAA condition and cannot manage their own benefits to have a representative payee.  Presumably, individuals who do not identify a representative payee will be assigned one.  A representative payee may be a nonprofit social service agency, a governmental social service agency or public guardian, a family member, or other interested person.  Additionally, all SSI and SSDI beneficiaries with DAA conditions will be referred to a state drug and alcoholism agency for treatment.  
<P>
	P.L.104-121 was driven by both cost containment and policy concerns.  From a policy perspective, it is the stated belief of Congress that providing SSDI and SSI benefits to alcoholics and/or drug addicts "fails to serve the interests of addicts and alcoholics, many of whom use their disability checks to purchase drugs and alcohol."  This may be true; however, NAMI is concerned that the new law could easily be misapplied to individuals dually diagnosed with severe mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders.  The prevalence of co-occurring substance abuse disorders among people with severe mental illnesses is quite high. 
<P>
 In fact, it is estimated that substance abuse disorders among young people with severe mental illnesses may exceed 50 percent, and the rates may be even higher among people who are homeless and severely mentally ill or who are not linked up with treatment.  
<P>
	Consumers with dual diagnoses who are currently SSDI or SSI recipients or applicants for these benefits should obtain documentation from their psychiatrist or physician that states that they are disabled due to severe mental illness.  This letter should clearly confirm that mental illness is the contributing factor to disability and that, without SSI or SSDI benefits, essential psychiatric care may not be available.
<P>
	Note:  For more information about the P.L.104-121, contact the Social Security's 24-hour, toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213.  Service representatives are available between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on business days.
