<H2>"Working Memory" and Schizophrenia</H2>
<HR>	



	While you are keeping something in mind, just where exactly is it kept?  Neuroscientists think they have an answer.  They believe 
they have located what amounts to the brain's scratch pad, where information is held temporarily when it is needed for some current task.
<p>
	New techniques for observing the brain in action are revealing that neurons in the prefrontal lobes, just behind the forehead, hold 
specific kinds of information for short-term use.  These neurons appear to be the neural basis for the mind's "working memory," which 
operates, say, when you dial a phone number.  "We've found cells for working memory in the prefrontal cortex that retrieve and temporarily 
hold information pulled from long-term memory stores that are dispersed throughout the brain," said Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic, a 
neuroscientist at Yale Medical School who has done much of the research.  The neurology of working memory, which is more widely known 
by the now outmoded term "short term" memory, may hold a vital clue to what goes wrong in the thinking of people with schizophrenia.
<p>
	"Working memory is the mental glue that links a though through time from its beginning to its end," said Dr. Goldman-Rakic.  
"The bizarre thought disorders in schizophrenia, especially the inability to keep a train of thought from getting derailed, could be due to a 
defect in working memory."  The new findings are consistent with theories of neuropsychology, largely based on clinical studies of brain-
damaged patients, that view the prefrontal region as the brain's executive center for making decisions, planning, and executing behavior.  
The key executive function of the prefrontal cortex, Dr. Goldman-Rakic argues, is working memory.
<p>
	One clinical implication of the work on the prefrontal cortex and working memory is the potential for a better understanding of 
some schizophrenia symptoms, such as the derailment of the train of thought.  Blood-flow studies of people with schizophrenia have shown 
that the prefrontal areas are often interactive, and these people also have difficulty in the same visual tracking tasks that Goldman-Rakic has 
used in her studies of working memory.  "The prefrontal areas receive a high concentration of dopamine, and drugs effective in treating 
schizophrenia act on dopamine receptors," said Goldman-Rakic.  She points out that a fairly new drug for schizophrenia, Clozapine, both 
increases dopamine release in the prefrontal areas and improves patients' thinking and memory.
