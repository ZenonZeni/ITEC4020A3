<img src="j.gif" align=left border=0 alt="J">ust a few months ago, Vietnam's petroleum industry was gushing little more than bad news. The discovery of only modest oil reserves, questionable policy moves, and high-profile withdrawals were conspiring to put a quick end to the rush for Vietnam's black gold.<p>

Despite the realization that Vietnam is not going to be the next Brunei (Vietnam's oil-rich, Asean neighbor), PetroVietnam, the state-owned oil and gas company, continues to seduce international oil and gas majors.<p> 

Enticing foreign investors are the upcoming awards of perhaps the last of Vietnam's promising oil blocks, and the completion of a gas "masterplan" which, if approved, will mark the beginning of Vietnam's gas industry.<p>

Contributing to growing optimism about Vietnam's petroleum potential, Mitsubishi's oil division, JVPC, and Malaysia's state-owned oil company, Petronas, both announced production start dates at their respective wells.<p>

But it is the American majors like Enron Development Corp., Unocal, Mobil and Conoco Corp., which appear to be playing a pivotal, and intriguing, role in the industry's resurgence.<p> 

Indeed, as tensions with China rise in the Eastern Sea, and Vietnam decides what energy strategy to take into the next century, it is the American firms which may be best positioned to address Vietnam's needs on both counts.<p>
 
<font size=+2>Regional Vision</font><p>

<a name="map1_1"><img src="a.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">fter two years of negotiations, Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp. signed an agreement with PetroVietnam in late May to explore for gas in the Gulf of Thailand, becoming the first company in Vietnam to receive financial terms for gas exploration (previously, terms had only been set for oil exploration).<p>

Unocal executives see the award in Block B off the southwestern tip of Vietnam <a href="map1.html">(see map 1)</a>, as an opportunity to consolidate Unocal's operations in the region, which include offshore gas developments in Thailand and Myanmar.  Only 90 miles northwest of the Vietnam field, Unocal is already producing and transporting gas to Thailand - the fastest growing gas market in the region.<p>

<tr>
<td valign=top><img src="pullq2.gif" alt="As Hanoi prepares to award its last most promising blocks, American firms appear to be playing a pivotal role.">

<td><a name="map2_1">"If you look at it as a region you see how these markets interplay with each other," said Unocal representative Barry Lane. "We're looking to possibly connect (Vietnam production) into that infrastructure and then sell it in Thailand, which is the big market."<p> 

In early June, PetroVietnam signed a preliminary agreement with another US major, Enron Development Corp., to be its partner to build a $161 million gas processing plant and export terminal at Dinh Co, near Vung Tau <a href="map2.html">(see map 2)</a>. The companies are negotiating a joint venture agreement for the plant, which would produce butane and propane for domestic and export markets, and refine gas for use at local power plants.<p>

Observers see the LPG plant as an important foot in the door for Enron. As one of the largest integrated gas companies in the world, Enron may be looking at bigger projects in Vietnam down the road, including power plants and gas pipeline networks to neighboring countries.<p>

Enron's presence may fit into Vietnam's long-term plans as well.
One analyst speculated: "British Gas was one of the forefathers of going in there when the country was opening up, so it was kind of surprising that they got kicked off of that project. Maybe Enron fit because Vietnam wanted another US company in there."<p>

<a name="story1">Houston-based Conoco Corp. has been the most active, and perhaps most interesting, of the US petroleum giants closing deals with PetroVietnam.<p>

In early April, Conoco won an award to explore what one industry source calls, "probably the most risky offshore blocks you'd find," at deep-water acreage in disputed territory with China. The award, Blocks 133 and 134, overlaps a claim awarded by China to Denver-based Crestone Corporation <a href="related1.html">(see related story)</a>.<p>

PetroVietnam offered "very favorable" terms to Conoco as an incentive to explore the block, said one source, leading some in the industry to speculate that Vietnam sought a heavyweight American investor to counter China's claims to the blocks.<p>

And Conoco's decision to join Malaysia's Petronas and Korea's LG Group to conduct a feasibility study for the beleaguered Dung Quat refinery at a site 80 miles south of Danang, has raised the question of whether the controversial refinery will indeed be built, and if so, why are the new players interested?<p>

<tr>
<td valign=top><img src="gasstand.gif" border=0 align=right alt="photo of Vietnamese motorist at the pump"><br clear><br>
<img src="gasstandquote.gif" align=right alt="Much of the gas consumed in Vietnam is refined outside the country and imported.">

<td><font size=+2>Will Dung Quat Be Built?</font><p>

<img src="i.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">ndustry experts say the government's decision to locate the refinery in remote Quang Ngai province makes the project uneconomical.  This is largely because there is almost no infrastructure at Dung Quat, and because the site is over 600 miles from the country's main oil supplies, near Vung Tau, and market, Ho Chi Minh City. Some experts say keeping the site could increase investment costs by at least $250 million, a price tag that led France's Total to withdraw its 30% stake in the project last year.<p>

Dr. Charles Johnson, an energy analyst at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, is focused on the stark numbers created by placing the refinery at Dung Quat.<p> 

He believes there is slim chance that foreign financiers will run to the project if the current site is kept.  "You can't raise funny money anymore. The banks are hard, so when you go out to raise money, you simply have to have viable projects," he said.<p>

If the site is not changed, then Johnson sees government subsidies in the form of tax concessions, guaranteed access to domestic markets, or a generous equity structure to account for the absence of private finance.<p> 

Whatever form the subsidies take, they will force the government to contribute the estimated minimum $250 million in additional costs - money which the government simply does not have, or will not commit to a single project, he believes.<p>

Leading Johnson to conclude that the politically loaded decision to locate Vietnam's first refinery at Dung Quat will not hold.<p> 

"Nobody's whispered anything into my ear about this, but I think economics win out on this one. The Vietnamese government doesn't throw around $250 million today on things that don't have any return it, anymore than anyone else does."<p>

The government might be able to salvage the situation, he suggests, by using a fraction of that amount to build at least rudimentary infrastructure in the region.  Roads, telecommunications, and power supplies could then naturally attract foreign investors of their own will, and achieve the government's commendable goal of increasing investment in the poor region.<p>

However, Paul Heuper, an energy analyst at Science Applications International in Washington DC who tracks Vietnam's energy sector for the US Department of Energy, points to Total's decision to withdraw from the project as proof that Hanoi's decision is final.<p>

"Total would not have pulled out unless there was a 0% chance that it would be moved," he said.<p>

<font size=+2>The Need to Act Now</font><p>

<img src="w.gif" align=left border=0 alt="W">ith investment returns on refineries relatively low to begin with, barely pushing double digits, and with strong competition from refineries in Southeast Asia, one wonders what opportunity the new players see in the project.<p>

Conoco spokesman Carleton Adams cautions that his company has only agreed to do a feasibility study, but thinks that if the terms are right, the refinery could be doable.<p>

"I think the economics of the refinery depend on exactly what the deal is, " Adams said. "And if it's not economical under one set of conditions, the feasibility study will determine what needs to be done to make it economical."<p>
 
The familiar refrain of looking for long-term opportunities is one explanation for joining the feasibility team.<p>

"For companies with a long term strategy to position themselves, you can see why they would take some interest in feasibility work, even while still having reservations," said East-West's Johnson. "Those sitting on the outside can sit on the outside for an awfully long time, and then opportunities could go by," he said.<p>

<a name="map1_2">Washington analyst Hueper concurs. "It's politically good to be in there. This will help Conoco out with future projects in Vietnam and Southeast Asia."<p>

In particular, some industry sources point to the bidding for promising block 15-1 <a href="map1.html">(see map 1)</a>, where Conoco is competing with Korea's Pedco, against three other groups: Mobil Corp.; France's Geopetrol SA; and a BP, Statoil, Mitsubishi, Exxon Corp. consortium.<p>

<tr>
<td valign=top><img src="pullq3.gif" alt="There's a basic misunderstanding that the gas is Vietnam's gas and therefore: Why should they pay anything for it at all? Until that concept is resolved within the Vietnamese government, the industry won't move very fast.">

<td><a name="story2">Block 15-1, and parts of the 9 and 16 Blocks to be awarded later this year, are coveted because they are located near Vietnam's largest, or "big elephant", find - the Vietsovpetro-operated Bach Ho field in the Cuu Long Basin. <a href="related2.html">(See related story.)</a><p>

When asked whether Conoco's participation in the feasibility study was part of a strategy to win the 15-1 award, Conoco's Adams said, "Anytime you start doing business with a country there is always the potential for one project to lead to another, but I don't know whether that's the basis of our going into Vietnam or not."<p>

<font size=+2>Partners With PetroVietnam or Petronas?</font><p>

<img src="o.gif" align=left border=0 alt="O">ne industry source believes that Conoco's participation is indeed related to promoting its business in Southeast Asia, but in Malaysia, not in Vietnam. There, Conoco is partnered with Petronas to build and operate a 130,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery.<p>

"If Conoco had their way, they wouldn't be there at all. What does a major player like Conoco want a 15% stake in a silly little refinery in Vietnam for?" the HCMC-based source said. "They got brought in, kicking and screaming I dare say, by their major client, Petronas," he said. "For Conoco, what's the harm in conducting a feasibility study compared to building a major refinery in Malaysia that's going to make you a fortune?," he added.<p>

"Our relationship with Petronas made it a natural fit to go in," Adams responds, "but I don't think it's accurate to say that was the only reason we went in. We've been interested in Vietnam, both in marketing and refining, for more than two years - before Total dropped out."<p>

Petronas officials confirm that they invited Conoco to participate in the feasibility study, but claim that changed conditions of the Dung Quat project may have led Conoco to take a closer look. One Petronas source said the government may now be willing to contribute more of the infrastructure costs.<p>

In addition, while the capacity of the refinery would remain the same, the  source said, the port being considered under this feasibility study is considerably smaller than the one proposed by Total.<p>

Refinery participants may also be able to market refined oil products domestically, as well as for export. This could prove a convincing incentive, given that the domestic market for refined products is expected to double over the next five years.<p>

As a result, the refinery may have lower costs than initially projected and provide the potential for higher returns, making this project considerably more palatable to private financing than the project studied by Total.<p>

Work on the new feasibility study began in March, and is expected to be completed by the end of September.<p>

<td valign=top><img src="oilrig.gif" border=0 align=right alt="photo of the White Tiger oil field"><br clear><br>
<img src="oilrigquote.gif" align=right><br clear alt="The White Tiger has produced 30 million tons for Vietsovpetro since 1986.">

<td><font size=+2>Vietsovpetro Won't Be Alone</font><p>

<img src="a.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">s the Dung Quat debate continues, new blocks are being tendered, explored, developed and, in some cases, abandoned.<p>

By the end of 1995, well over $2 billion had been spent by foreign oil majors in upstream exploration and production in Vietnam. In 1995, Vietnam earned approximately $1.3 billion in crude oil sales, accounting for almost 30% of Vietnam's total export revenue.<p>

Much of the crude is bought by Japanese trading houses, and some 70% of it is exported to Japan, where it is used mostly at oil-fired power plants.<p>

Mitsubishi and Petronas both announced production start dates at their respective fields, while the Vietsovpetro operated Bach Ho field pumped 100,000 bpd in 1995. Petronas officials said Phase I of production at the Ruby field, 50 miles northeast of Bach Ho, should begin by the end of 1996, producing 9,500 bpd, and reaching 25,000 bpd by 1998.<p>

Production at Mitsubishi's Rang Dong field in block 15-2 should begin by May 1998, company officials said. Initial production could reach 45,000 bpd, possibly peaking at 100,000 bpd.<p>

Shell finally made its long-expected announcement that it was letting its $150 million exploration in Block 10 expire, and will instead focus on its downstream operations.<p>

BHP's contract dispute over operations at Dai Hung field continues, and though the company has repeatedly threatened to end production, few in the industry believe it will do so. They speculate that with $180 million invested at Dai Hung already, BHP won't walk away completely from the project - even though reserve estimates have been progressively downgraded from 800 million barrels to 100 million.<p>

The Dai Hung dispute excepted, industry reps say the terms being offered to upstream developers, while not as attractive as those given in the early 1990s, are basically on par for the region, and continue to promote exploration and development.<p>

<a name="story3">However, proposed changes to the business structure between foreign operators and PetroVietnam have some in the industry concerned. The government is encouraging PetroVietnam to pursue joint ventures instead of production sharing contracts (PSCs), the traditional oil industry contract.<p>

<a name="map1_3">Russ Burkhoven, GM of Exxon Exploration in Hanoi, is prepared to adapt. "In the near future the challenge is how to resolve managing a joint venture under the foreign investment law - right now the JV vehicle runs in conflict with the foreign investment law," he said. "There'll be ways of working with it, but it's not clear how it's going to work out. Nobody has charted a path through all this yet," Burkhoven said. <a href="related3.html">(See related story.)</a><p>

<td valign=top><a href="map1.html"><img src="map1_s.gif" border=0 align=right alt="map"></a>

<td><font size=+2>The Gas Industry - A Masterplan Complete</font><p>

<img src="l.gif" align=left border=0 alt="L">ast year, Vietnam took a step towards exploiting its gas resources when PetroVietnam began harnessing associated gas at the Bach Ho oil field, bringing it the 124 km to shore via an $150 million pipeline built by South Korea's Hyundai. About one-third of the gas produced at the field is used to fuel a 185 MW power plant in Ba Ria.<p>

But the real start to Vietnam's industry begins when gas comes ashore from the Nam Con Son Basin, some 400 km offshore, and where Vietnam's most promising gas finds have been made by British Petroleum and its partner, Norway's Statoil. Conservative reserve estimates at the Lan Do and Lan Tay fields range between 2.5 and 3 trillion cubic feet.<p>

Developing the gas industry quickly is of vital interest to  all businesses in southern Vietnam, since gas-fired power plants will help ease the South's overburdened electricity network. In addition, fertilizer, glass, steel and ceramics industries lining the Highway 51 industrial corridor may also benefit by tapping directly into gas pipelines to meet their energy needs.<p>

However, power plants at Phu My, near Vung Tau, will be the primary gas consumers. The four-phase development of gas-fired power plants at Phu My is projected to bring another 2400MW to the grids by 2005.<p>

The first of the 600MW plants, Phu My 2.1, is under construction. The plant is being built by ABB and Marubeni with World Bank funding and is scheduled to be operational by mid-1997.<p>

Power plants at Thu Duc and Long Binh that supply energy to the HCMC-Vung Tau-Bien Hoa industrial triangle could also become sizable gas consumers if converted from fuel-oil to gas-fired plants.<p>

In mid-May, a consortium of PetroVietnam, Mobil, BP, Statoil,  British Gas and finance-consultants Mott Ewbank Preece submitted the long-awaited "Gas Masterplan," without which, Vietnam's natural gas industry cannot truly begin. Eighteen months in the making, the report details how gas production and demand must be simultaneously developed to promote investment in the sector.<p>

<a name="map2_2">Copies of the report have been submitted to the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), as well as to Anil Malhotra in Washington DC. The MPI retained Malhotra, the World Bank's Energy Advisor for Asia, to review the report and provide recommendations to PetroVietnam and Electricity of Vietnam by September.<p>

<tr>
<td valign=top><a href="map2.html"><img src="map2_s.gif" border=0 align=right alt="map"></a>

<td>"The industry view that the Nam Con Son basin is more gas prone than oil prone is a very major change that requires a re-look at Vietnam's whole energy sector strategy," Malhotra said. "The reserve findings have an impact on coal, on hydro, and have a slew of implications on how you develop the gas industry."<p>

According to one Hanoi-based source close to the report, one key finding was that reserves in the Nam Con Son fields are large enough to support gas exports throughout the region.<p>

The ability to export would add significant incentive for potential developers because even with new power plants coming on line in the next decade, Vietnam has a relatively small market that will reach saturation point well before the country's gas resources are exhausted.<p>  

Exports provide an outlet for excess supplies and the possibility of garnering higher prices. Mobil's contribution to the masterplan focused on export potential of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to Thailand, southern China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.<p>

"The domestic market for gas is still in its infancy, so those people who are continuing to explore are basically doing it in anticipation that there will be alternative markets available," said one industry source.<p>

<font size=+2>If the Price is Right</font><p>

<img src="a.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">nother key issue is finding a balance between a domestic gas price that recovers the foreign operators' development and transportation costs, while allowing power plant operators to sell electricity at a price acceptable to Vietnamese consumers.<p>

With the World Bank agreeing to fund the first Phu My plant under the condition that future plants are privately financed, Vietnam is deeply concerned about offering attractive terms to potential power plant investors. Those terms will only come if electricity prices are high enough to recoup investment costs - putting the squeeze on prices of gas inputs.<p>

Les Blair, HCMC manager for British Gas, which has been exploring Block 4-1 for gas (with limited results) expressed concern about the government's position on pricing.<p>

"There's a basic misunderstanding that the gas is Vietnam's gas and therefore: Why should they pay anything for it at all?," he said. "Until that concept is resolved within the Vietnamese government, the industry won't move forward very fast."<p>

But one contributor to the masterplan felt confident that an acceptable balance could be found. He believes that the gas price could be in the range of $2.75-$3.25 per million BTU, allowing power plants to sell at around 5 cents per KWH - substantially lower than electricity prices in Thailand or Indonesia, for example.<p>

"I think those prices are supportable numbers that could generate electricity at current prices in Vietnam, and still give a return to our shareholders," he said.<p>

Industry sources say the government recognizes the economic benefits of developing its gas resources, and is ready to make policy decisions to move forward on the plan by late 4th quarter 1996 or early 1997.<p>

The stage is now set for gas explorers and developers to fully invest, with American companies firmly part of the pack. And for those companies fortunate enough to have tapped into some of Vietnam's oil, especially Mitsubishi and Petronas, it is time to be rewarded for their long explorations.<p>
