<B><A NAME="anx">ANXIETY</A>.</B> Sometimes the underlying factor in a complicated case
of severe low blood sugar, depression, chronic allergies, grand mal
seizures, and heart palpitations is a mental symptom such as anxiety,
according to naturopaths Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman, N.D., and Robert
Ullman, N.D. They treated a man, aged 40, who had these symptoms and who
had been on Dilantin for 2 years to control his seizures. They prescribed
homeopathic Argentum nitricum (silver nitrate, 6C, three times daily). 
<P>One
month later he was feeling much improved, with an easing-up of many
symptoms. 
<P>After 6 months, having taken a stronger potency of Argentum
nitricum (30C) but less frequently, he cut back his Dilantin regimen from
300 mg daily to 100 mg every 4 days. Two years after beginning treatment,
"he feels really well," states Dr. Reichenberg-Ullman. "He can no longer
remember most of what bothered him before."

<P><B><A NAME="asth">ASTHMA</A>.</B> Enzyme therapist
Lita Lee, Ph.D. successfully worked with a man, aged 75, who, in effect,
had been unable to breathe easily for six decades, since he first came down
with asthma at age 14. He had to use an inhaler 4-6 times daily; in
addition, he had arthritis, herpes on his legs, arms, and neck, and sugar
intolerance. 
<P>For his asthma, Dr. Lee suggested an herbal formula including
Oregon grape root, safflower petals, red clover tops, coleus forskohlii,
and digestive enzymes.  For his arthritis, she gave him a formula
containing yucca, alfalfa juice concentrate, safflower petals, oat straw,
and glucosamine sulfate; for the herpes, Dr. Lee gave him the food enzymes
lipase and amylase plus fatty acids; and for the sugar intolerance, Dr. Lee
gave him a digestive formula containing the enzymes protease, amylase,
lipase, cellulase, sucrase, lactase, and maltase. 
<P>"Reach for these formulas
instead of your inhaler the next time you feel an asthma attack coming on,"
Dr. Lee advised him. She expected it would take many weeks before he had
good results. However, two days after starting this enzyme program, he told
Dr. Lee he was no longer using the inhaler. After 3 weeks, his arthritis
and herpes symptoms were much improved and his need even for the enzymes
was minimal.

<P><B><A NAME="ather">ATHEROSCLEROSIS</A>.</B> William H. Philpott, M.D., 
reports excellent results from
using magnet therapy for atherosclerosis resulting from diabetes. A man,
aged 70, with atherosclerotic heart disease, underwent a multiple bypass
operation. Two years later his heart pain returned, leaving him unsteady on
his feet and subject to disorientation in familiar surroundings; his speech
grew thick and he became chronically depressed. 
<P>Dr. Philpott had him sleep
with the negative pole of several magnets (ferrous ceramic, 2000-4000 gauss
in strength) placed at the crown of his head. The man also wore a magnet
strapped to his skin over his heart during the day. Within a week, his
symptoms  improved and after one month of this treatment, he had no heart
pain, his balance returned, his speech became distinct, and his depression
was gone. Through this method, "the mental confusion, disorientation, and
depression of cerebral atherosclerosis is remarkably reduced or even
completely relieved," reports Dr. Philpott.

<P><B><A NAME="canc">CANCER</A>.</B> Magnet therapy can produce dramatic 
turnarounds in certain kinds of
cancer, states William H. Philpott, M.D. Dr. Philpott treated a woman, aged
71, who had a basal cell carcinoma on her forehead as a result of intense
sunburn. Every night, Dr. Philpott had the woman sleep with a 12,300-gauss
magnet placed, negative side down,  directly on the cancerous area. In 6
weeks, this pathological spot had dried up and peeled off without a scar,
reports Dr. Philpott. Five years later there was still no reappearance of
the cancer.

<P>Dr. Philpott treated another woman, aged 75, who had a melanoma
tumor on her forehead. Dr. Philpott had the woman wear a 3950-gauss magnet
over the cancerous growth for 24 hours a day for 3 months. After one month
of this treatment, the tumor stopped growing and its soreness eased up;
then the tumor started to recede and dry up; after 10 weeks, it literally
fell off her forehead. 
<P>According to Dr. Philpott, magnet therapy achieves
these results because it applies a negative pole magnetic field to the
cancer. This changes the pH of the cells, which are too acidic, making them
more alkaline, which is favorable to healing. In addition, the negative
magnetic field releases oxygen bound up in the acids of the unhealthy
cells. The oxygen then diffuses throughout the cells, restoring health and
vitality.

the ages of 30 and 60 who had endured chronic constipation for an average
of 24 years. These patients had bowel movements no more frequently than
once every 4 days. Over a 7-week period, each woman received 15 reflexology
treatments lasting 30 minutes each. No other dietary, life-style, or
treatment programs were used. 
<P>At the end of the program, the average
frequency of bowel motion was 1.8 days, or more than twice as frequently as
before. Previously, 40% of the patients had experienced pain during
defecation; now none of them had pain. In addition, 50% of the women had
normal stool consistency whereas none had this before; 85% reported
improved digestion; 55% were able to reduce their use of laxatives; and 80%
reported that other health conditions had also changed for the better.

illness and death in children. According to a clinical study of 92 children
in Nicaragua, the use of three homeopathic remedies produced a 15% decrease
in the duration of diarrhea, reports Jennifer Jacobs, M.D., of the

<B><A NAME="insomnia">INSOMNIA</A>.</B> If you can't fall asleep at night, 
Ray Sahelian, M.D., recommends
taking melatonin supplement (1 mg) 2 hours before your normal bedtime. If,
after 3 nights, your insomnia has not improved, take one stronger dose of
2-3 mg. 

<P>For example, one patient took 3 mg of melatonin for 2 months while
undergoing a difficult divorce. Another patient used 3-6 mg once nightly to
reduce the time it took her to fall asleep-from 2 hours to 30 minutes.
Police officers working 7 successive night shifts took a once-daily dose of
5 mg and reported improved sleep, elevated mood, and enhanced alertness
during their working hours, states Dr. Sahelian. When normal sleep patterns
are established again, gradually taper off from 3 mg to 2 mg, then after a
few more nights, drop down to 1 mg, then after a few more nights, stop the
melatonin, advises Dr. Sahelian.

<P><B><A NAME="migraine">MIGRAINE</A>.</B> A migraine headache is not caused 
by an Imitrex&reg; deficiency
(remedied at $36 a shot), state Jonathan Wright, M.D. and Alan Gaby, M.D.
For migraine sufferers, Drs. Wright and Gaby recommend an initial food
allergy and sensitivity screening to eliminate allergic, headache-provoking
foods from the diet. These typically include wheat, oranges, tea, coffee,
eggs, chocolate, milk, beef, corn, cane sugar, yeast, peas, and mushrooms.
In a study of 60 patients who regularly consumed at least 10
headache-provoking foods, when these were eliminated, the number of monthly
migraines plummeted from 402 to 6 and 85% of the patients became
headache-free.

<P>Drs. Wright and Gaby further advise that patients have
screening tests for hypoglycemia and hormone allergies and that they take
allergy densensitization drops daily. They also suggest that patients 
complement this with a program of supplements including: magnesium (200 mg,
twice daily); vitamin B6 (200 mg, twice daily); vitamin B2 (200 mg, twice
daily); feverfew capsules (6 daily); and a  nonallergenic multiple
vitamin-mineral. Regarding vitamin B2, when 49 people with chronic
migraines took 400 mg daily of vitamin B2 for 3 months, their average
number of headaches dropped by 67% while the severity lessened by 68%.

<P><B>MULTIPLE <A NAME="ms">SCLEROSIS</A>.</B> A woman named Elizabeth, aged 40, had suffered with
multiple sclerosis (MS) for 19 years, reports Effie Poy Yew Chow, Ph.D.,
R.N., a certified acupuncturist practicing at East West Academy of Healing
Arts in San Francisco, California.  Elizabeth was legally blind, had no
sensation or movement in her legs and only little in her arms, and had no
muscle tone at all. She was restricted to a wheelchair and couldn't turn
herself in bed or feed herself; her speech was slurred and stuttering and
she was deeply depressed. 
<P>Dr. Chow treated her one hour a day for 2 days a
month for 6 months using Qigong, acupuncture, acupressure, physical
exercise, herbs, and visualization. After the first day's treatment,
Elizabeth was able to turn over in bed 6 times by herself and in later
weeks she was able to turn herself 100 times as an exercise. Her arm
tremors decreased substantially as did her muscle spasms; she gained
sensation in her legs, became able to feed herself and to speak more
clearly without stuttering; and she felt positive and happy. Four years
after treatment began, Elizabeth continues to progress without setback,
says Dr. Chow.

<P><B><A NAME="Nerve">NERVE</A> PAIN.</B> An elderly man with diabetes-related 
nerve pain (neuropathy)
had constant severe burning pain in his feet for which he had found no
relief. William H. Philpott, M.D., placed a magnet, negative, south-pole
down (3950 gauss strength) on the soles of the patient's feet. Within
minutes, the nerve pain vanished and he remained pain-free for several
hours. When the pain returned, a second treatment with magnets eliminated
it. After several days of magnet therapy, the man's nerve pain was
permanently gone, says Dr. Philpott.

<P><B>POST-OPERATIVE <A NAME="nausea">NAUSEA</A>.</B>
According to data reported by S. Philips, M.D., 120 women undergoing
gynecologic surgery who took 1 gram of powdered ginger root one hour before
receiving anesthesia had a markedly lower incidence of nausea and vomiting
after surgery. Specifically,  for those taking ginger root only  21% had
nausea, while for those taking metoclopramide (a conventional antinausea
drug), it was 27%, and for those on placebo, it was 41%. Further, twice as
many patients in these last 2 groups required medication to control
vomiting while none of the  patients who took ginger root needed any
medicine.

<P><B><A NAME="PMS">PREMENSTRUAL</A> SYNDROME.</B> A study revealed that 35 women with stressful
premenstrual symptoms who received ear, hand, and foot reflexology once
weekly for 8 weeks (in 30-minute sessions) reported a 62.6% reduction in
PMS symptoms and discomfort. According to reflexologists William Flocco and
Terry Oleson, who conducted the study, the  women monitored 39 different
distress symptoms beginning 2 months before treatment and extending for 2
months after treatment ended. "These clinical findings support the use of
ear, hand, and foot reflexology for the treatment of premenstrual tension,"
concluded Flocco and Oleson.
