<P>The past two decades have seen the biology of fish larvae blossom into
an exciting field of research. These tiny, usually transparent early life
stages had been neglected because of the difficulties in collecting, identifying,
and maintaining them. With many of these problems solved, field and laboratory
studies are leading to an understanding of how processes affecting larval
fishes may have serious consequences for populations of adult fishes. Survival
through the larval phase is, of course, necessary if populations are to
continue. Like adult fishes, larvae must find food and avoid predators.
However, unlike adults, they must do so during a period when their abilities
vary due to morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes that accrue
during development. </P>

<P>Recent and ongoing investigations involve both laboratory and field
experiments on the importance of predation in the life of fish larvae.
Behavioral experiments, recorded on video tape for subsequent frame-by-frame
motion analysis, provide details of the interaction between predators and
fish larvae as prey. Changes in responsiveness and response effectiveness
of larvae attacked by various predators are studied throughout the developmental
period. Parallel studies of sensory and locomotor development help determine
how behavior might be constrained by morphology. Variations in environmental
conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, and pollutants) are also investigated
for their influence on larva behavior. Field experiments are used to form
ecological interpretations for the laboratory results. </P>
