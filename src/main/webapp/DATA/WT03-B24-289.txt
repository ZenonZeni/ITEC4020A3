<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+1>C</FONT>alifornia's rich literary history makes for great reading - as do the works of the many authors who currently live and write in the Golden State. Residents of California are blessed not just with a rich<I> literature of their own</I> - but with the opportunity to often see and hear writers who may well be their neighbors. California's many independent bookstores act as a link in the chain of literature: independent bookstores host readings with local authors;  stock titles from regional presses; and maintain sections devoted to local interests and writers. <B><a href="stores.html">NCIBA bookstores</a></B> - which are locally owned and operated - bring writers and readers together. 

<P>The literature of California begins with the Native American oral traditions and the earliest printed material of the Spanish and Mexican periods. Since then, a great body of work - novels, stories, poems, plays, essays, memoirs, histories and much else - has grown out the state's often tumultous history. Through the early adventure stories of Jack London through the Depression-era novels of John Steinbeck till the jazz-inspired poetry of the Beats until today's multicultural writers - California has contributed not only to the literature of the United States but to the world. Be sure and visit your local library or bookstore - where books by California authors or books on California subjects may be found. Also, please visit the NCIBA page on <B><a href="californ.html">California Literature</a></B>, where you can find out more about the state's abundant literary history, including:

<A NAME="TRIVIA">
<CENTER><FONT color=red SIZE=+1><B><P>CALIFORNIA LITERARY TRIVIA</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The name "California" is derived from an old Spanish novel, "Las Sergas de Esplandian" ("The Exploits of Esplandian"). Written about 1500 by <B>Garci Ordonez de Montalvo</B>, the book contains several fanciful references to an island called <I>California </I> populated by Amazons. The early European explorers who ventured into the region undoubtably had this place-name in mind when they first described the State.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The first book in English to be printed in California was written by a Pole naturalized as an American citizen, <B>Felix Paul Wierzbicki</B>. The book was "California As It Is, And As It May Be" (1849).

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> <B>Robert Frost</B> - best known as a poet of New England life, was born in San Francisco in 1874.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> During Hollywood's early days, the Belgian playwright and Nobel Prizewinner<B> Maurice Maeterlinck</B>, who spoke no English, was hired to adapt his novel<I> La vie des abeilles</I> for film. However, when the screenplay was translated, movie moguls were shocked to find the hero was a bee, the producers not knowing what the word <I>abeille</I> meant.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> "They Knew What They Wanted" (1924), a play by <B>Sidney Howard</B>, was the first work by a Californian to win the Pulitzer Prize.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> <B>John Steinbeck</B> is the only Californian to have won both the Pulitzer Prize (fiction, 1940) and Nobel Prize (literature, 1962).

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Other California winners of the Pulitzer Prize include <B>William Saroyan</B> (drama, 1940), <B>Upton Sinclair</B> (fiction, 1943), <B>George Oppen</B> (poetry, 1969), <B>Wallace Stegner</B> (fiction, 1973),<B> Gary Snyder</B> (poetry, 1974) and<B> Alice Walker</B> (fiction, 1984).

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore, co-founded by poet <B>Lawrence Ferlinghetti</B> in June 1953, was the nation's first all paperback bookstore.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Polish poet<B> Czeslaw Milosz</B>, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, has lived and taught in Berkeley since the early 1960's.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Some of the many non-California writers who have lived and worked in the state for considerable periods of time include <B>Mark Twain, Henryk Sienkiewicz, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, Aldous Huxley, Bertolt Brecht, Christopher Isherwood, Jack Kerouac</B> and <B>Allen Ginsberg</B>.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Berkeley poet <B>Robert Hass</B> was the first California writer to be named Poet Laureate of the United States (1995).
