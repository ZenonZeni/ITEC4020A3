<H3><A NAME="DESC">Course Description</A></H3>

<P>Participants will become familiar with computer and calculator technologies and their uses in the secondary mathematics classroom.  The course will be activity-oriented and address instructional issues raised by technology use including appropriate use, equity curriculum integration and change, and the nature of mathematical activity.  

<P>Software to be used includes graphing utilities, dynamic geometry, symbolic algebraic manipulation, and spreadsheets.  We will also use calculators, including graphing calculators, and the calculator-based laboratory.  Participants will be introduced to Internet resources including e-mail, newsgroups, and the World-Wide Web.
<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to top.</A>
<H3><A NAME="ACT">Course Activities</A></H3>

<P>Participants will use the various technological tools to particpate in and design investigations.  All participants will be expected to develop classroom instructional materials, some of which will be presented in class.  Participants will keep a reactive journal to document their thought processes during the investigations and consider uses of and concerns about technology in the classroom.  Other written assignments will include evaluation of software, curriculum materials, and internet resources and issue-reated critiques.  A final project will include a presentation and paper.

<H3><A NAME="REQ">Requirements</A></H3>

<P>All course readings will be made available in class, online, or on file in Dr. Shealy's office for loan.  All participants should have access to e-mail.  An account on the UB UNIX system is highly recommended.  You can <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/computing/liaison/accounts.html">apply for accounts</A> at the <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/computing/liaison">User Liaison Office</A> in 215 Computing Center and get software for connecting from home at the <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/computing/Help-Desk/">Computing Center Help Desk</A>, 216 Computing Center, or by <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/about/software/mac/">downloading</A> it online.  A few <A HREF="http://www.ti.com/calc/docs/82.htm">TI-82</A> calculators will be available for loan.  It is highly recommended that you have your own graphing calculator.  We will use TI-82's most of the time in class, but <A HREF="http://www.ti.com/calc/docs/83.htm">TI-83</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ti.com/calc/docs/85.htm">TI-85</A>, <A HREF="http://www.casio-usa.com/cgi/index.cgi?cat=calculators&ser=Graphic+Calculators">Casio CFX 9800G or CFX 9850G</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.hp.com:80/handheld/calculators/product_info/hp38g_prdtinfo.html">HP 38G</A> are comparable and acceptable.  Optional computer software packages are available for purchase at discount prices in the bookstore.

<H3><A NAME="SPEC">Special Needs</A></H3>

<P>If you have a diagnosed disability (physical, learning, or psychological) which will make it difficult for you to carry out the course work as outlined, or, requires accommodations such as recruiting note takers, readers, or extended time on exams and/or assignments, please advise me during the first two weeks of the course so we may review possible arrangements for reasonable accommodations.
<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to top.</A>
<H3><A NAME="EVAL">Evaluation</A></H3>

<P>Student evaluation will be based on performance in and write-ups of assigned investigations, developed classroom materials, a major project, and the journal.  Investigations and classroom materials will account for 60% of the grade, the major project  30%, and journal 10%.
