<p><h3>The Hydrogen Solution</H3></center>
<p> 
<p>
<p><b>Will we ever find inexpensive ways to produce energy and fuel 
without harming

the environment?</b><p>Let's find out, in this imaginary journey to the 
future ...
<p>
Our first stop is the year 2005.  We're in the middle of a large, busy 
city on the

U.S. West Coast. We can hear the familiar roar of internal combustion 
engines all

around us, but there are almost no toxic emissions coming from all these 
cars, trucks,

and buses; most of them emit little more than harmless water vapor.
<p>
The next stop is the year 2050.  Now we're in a more agricultural 
setting, in the

middle of the Great Plains.  On the horizon, we spot some large solar 
and wind energy

systems; they are helping to produce a new source of electricity and 
transportation fuel

without spewing tons of harmful gases or particulates into the air.
<p>

     We zoom ahead to the year 2150, to a lush, green park in the middle 
of a large

but uncrowded metropolitan area on the East Coast that's unlike anything 
we've ever

seen before.  No electric power lines are visible anywhere, the sky is a 
bright blue, and

the air smells fresh and clean.  On the horizon we can see a row of 
large storage tanks

on slender pipes that poke like tree roots into the ground.  These tanks 
store hydrogen,

which is piped into the city and used for transportation, heating, 
cooling, and electric

power by all those who live and work there.


<p>Mere fantasies?  Perhaps not--especially if we keep finding new and 
better ways

to produce and use hydrogen for our energy and fuel needs.  Researchers 
funded by

the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at our national laboratories have 
already joined

with experts at universities and in industry to explore promising new 
hydrogen

production, storage, and use technologies.  These new technologies 
should allow us to

put nature's most basic element to work for us as a versatile energy 
carrier and a clean

fuel.


<p>DOE researchers are exploring new ways to produce hydrogen for energy 
and

fuel from water, plant materials, and other sources, such as fossil 
fuels, using three

main technical approaches:  photolysis, electrolysis, and thermal 
processes.  Photolytic

research includes the investigation of photelectrochemical processes 
(which make use

of light and chemical reactions to produce hydrogen) and photobiological 
processes (in

which living things, such as plants and bacteria, use light to produce 
hydrogen).  In

electrolysis research, we are investigating novel ways to electrolyze 
water at higher

temperatures, which "splits" the water into hydrogen and oxygen.  
Research in new

thermal processes includes investigations of advanced gasification and 
pyrolysis

systems; biomass (grasses, trees, and agricultural residues) and 
municipal solid waste

are the target feedstocks (starting materials) for these thermal 
processes.


<p>In some photoelectrochemical processes, sunlight striking a 
semiconductor

immersed in water produces high-purity hydrogen gas. These processes 
make use of

the photovoltaic effect, in which semiconductors made of silicon and 
other materials

convert light directly to electricity to split water into hydrogen and 
oxygen.


<p>Solar cells similar to the ones used in space can be used to 
electrolyze the

water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. DOE-funded researchers have 
already been
able to convert 8% of the energy in solar radiation to hydrogen, as they 
work toward a

maximum theoretical efficiency of more than 20%. The goal is to reach 
15% conversion

efficiency by the year 2000 and begin commercial production of hydrogen 
with this

technique by 2010.


<p>The primary challenge is to find an appropriate semiconductor. Most

semiconductors do not generate enough voltage for this process, and they 
corrode in

water. Researchers are investigating new materials, changes in device 
surfaces, and

protective coatings on solar cells to overcome these problems. They are 
also

investigating the use of tandem cells with high voltages and different 
metal catalysts;

this is important because today's best hydrogen-producing catalysts are 
expensive.


<p>In photobiological processes, photosynthetic microorganisms -- 
bacteria and

algae, for example --  produce hydrogen directly from sewage or 
food-processing

waste.  Photosynthetic algae can generate hydrogen directly from water.  
Several

teams of researchers have already isolated a number of photosynthetic 
microorganisms

that use light to generate hydrogen.  


<p>In sunlight, without oxygen, some of these bacteria produce hydrogen 
efficiently

from soluble organic acids, such as those found in sewage or waste 
materials from

food-processing plants.  Other photosynthetic bacteria, when denied both 
light and air,

convert carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This 
makes it

possible to turn various thermal (heat-based) processes for generating 
synthesis gas

(primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into hydrogen-production 
processes. The

bacteria are so efficient that they can remove 99.99% of the carbon 
monoxide from

their surroundings while producing hydrogen at 20 times their own volume 
per minute.


<p>Exciting recent discoveries in this research program have resulted in 
the

isolation of photosynthetic microorganisms that can generate hydrogen 
even in the

presence of oxygen. This opens the door to the possibility of developing 
an industrial

process for splitting water photobiologically.  


<p>Using thermal processes such as fast pyrolysis allows us to vaporize 
biomass at

moderately high temperatures without oxygen; these vapors are then 
catalytically

reformed to produce hydrogen.  Researchers are currently investigating 
the possibility

of producing hydrogen from biomass in a fast-pyrolysis reactor. 


<p>Any of these new production technologies could develop into an 
efficient,

economical means of producing hydrogen.  And any of them could be 
combined with a

number of promising storage and utilization technologies to help 
hydrogen fulfill its

potential as the "ultimate fuel"--one that DOE predicts will join 
electricity as a primary

energy carrier in the not-too-distant future.

<center><h3>Hydrogen Viable Prospect for Near-Term</H3></center>
<p>  
    Despite the fact that technical and societal factors stand in the way 
of 
    hydrogen becoming a fuel for the masses, a new analysis conducted by 

    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) suggests that there are 

    viable scenarios for making the transition to high-mileage electric 
    vehicles powered by a combination of batteries and hydrogen-fueled 
power 
    systems.
<p>     
    In the report, "Hydrogen as a Transportation Fuel: Costs and 
Benefits," 
    analysts look at hydrogen's economic viability for powering a 
five-passenger 
    vehicle such as a Ford Taurus with a range of about 80 miles per 
gallon.  
    LLNL concluded that over time there are compelling reasons to try to 
shift 
    away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles.
<p>     
    For example, with a sizable fleet of alternative vehicles operating 
in the 
    United States by 2030, oil imports could be cut by two billion 
barrels per 
    year, saving $1.2 trillion at $30 per barrel of oil.  But such 
savings 
    cannot be achieved overnight, LLNL warned.
<p>     
    "The most striking point about oil-use reductions and 
alternative-fuel 
    vehicles is the very long lead times necessary for large-scale 
change.  
    Alternative-fuel cars introduced in 2005 do not begin to materially 
    influence aggregate oil use for another decade, and two decades more 
(2035) 
    are required to replace gasoline vehicles," the report says.
<p>     
    "We have shown that you could put hydrogen-fueled vehicle on the road 
in the 
    near term," said Robert Schock, associate director for energy at 
LLNL.  "It 
    does not have to be as far off as people have supposed."
<p>     
    Schock added that policymakers have erred in the past by focusing on 
the 
    total costs of a hydrogen-fueled auto economy and the associated 
    infrastructure requirements.  "What DOE needed to do is to look at 
the 
    transition phase and ask, How do you get there?"
<p>     
    The study points out that hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can fill 
the niche 
    for hydrogen vehicles without awaiting the development of 
cost-effective 
    fuel cells.  "HEVs coupled with small-scale hydrogen production 
and/or 
    storage are among the most promising systems," the LLNL report says.

Harnessing the Big H
Hydrogen Seems the Ideal Energy Source--Plentiful, Efficient and
Clean. Can Something This Perfect Be Real? Just Ask the Japanese.

Los Angeles Times Magazine, Page 18

<p>
West of Denver, Interstate 70 enters Golden, Colo., and begins to
curl through the foothills of the Rockies. There it bisects an unassuming
clump of brick buildings--the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Among
the government's national laboratories, NREL is modest, operating on a
fraction of the billions commanded by atomic research giants like Sandia,
Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. Inside, there are no monstrous
particle accelerators; experiments here are more likely to proceed in
test-tube racks, bell jars and small glass beakers, like the one John
Turner is filling with a clear solution of water and household lye.

<p>   Turner, a chemist with a graying blond beard and gold-rimmed glasses,
sticks a narrow glass slide, coated on one end with a black, mica-like
substance, into the lye solution. The humming lab ventilators mask the
sound of the vehicles whizzing by on the nearby interstate, but Turner
has spent most of his career here, and during those years he's always had
the cars in mind. As he aims a pencil-thin beam from a high-intensity
lamp at the flask, he puts it this way: &quot;Suppose someone announced he
intended to ship millions of gallons of a carcinogenic, explosive fluid
that emits toxic fumes through our downtown and then store it underground
in our neighborhoods. People would rise up in anger, right?&quot;

<p>   Wrong. Just outside on I-70, cars are spraying residues of that very
poison all over the mountains. After 11 decades of tinkering, their
internal combustion engines are miracles of technology with hundreds of
moving parts. Yet various laws of physics still limit their ability to
extract energy from petroleum. Nearly three-fourths of its potential
simply radiates away or pours, partly combusted, out the tailpipe, rising
in geologic layers of brown murk until the Rockies themselves dwindle to
ghostly smudges.   John Turner is among a cadre of scientists trying to
suppress what he regards as humanity's most pervasive, and
self-inflicted, epidemic. In a little more than a century, since Thomas
Alva Edison invented the light bulb and Henry Ford began to mass-produce
automobiles, man-made energy has become the most addictive drug in
history. Everybody today was born into this dependency: No one any longer
can imagine life without electricity or motorized vehicles. To slake our
craving, we must dose ourselves and our surroundings daily with deadly
filth. This ritual is now doomed to spread, as China, India and other
developing nations bestow family cars and refrigerators upon 2 billion
new recruits to the industrial age.

<p>   Getting an entire world to kick a habit is futile, so Turner is trying
to at least find us a clean needle. As the beam strikes the shiny black
square centimeter of semiconductor glued to the submerged portion of his
slide, the surrounding liquid begins to fizz. Electrons stimulated by
light, he explains, are rushing to the semiconductor's surface, hitting
water molecules and splitting them into their component parts: oxygen and
hydrogen.

<p>   He watches the tiny bubbles rise. &quot;For years,&quot; he says, &quot;this has been
the Holy Grail of photoelectric chemists. We're witnessing the direct
conversion of solar energy into hydrogen.&quot;

<p>   *

<p>   Cape Canaveral, June, 1994: A group of visiting scientists and
engineers is touring the John F.Kennedy Space Center in blue-and-white
air-conditioned buses. They're here for the World Hydrogen Energy
 Conference, a biennial event born of the energy crisis 20 years earlier.
Although the price of petroleum has since calmed considerably (adjusted
for inflation, it's actually cheaper than pre-1973), a groundswell of
concern, coupled with numerous breakthroughs, has ballooned this
gathering to nearly 600 researchers from 34 countries. They've come to
Canaveral this year for inspiration: The huge tank on the pad, where the
shuttle Columbia will presently lift spaceward, is filled with pure
hydrogen.

<p>   Since even before the moon shots, all U.S. astronauts' heat,
electricity and drinking water have been derived from hydrogen. The U.S.
space program is the first step toward realizing these scientists' dream:
to switch the planet from an economy fueled with dirty coal and petroleum
to one run on clean hydrogen.

<p>   The idea of something so ubiquitous--hydrogen is the most abundant
element, composing three-fourths of the mass of the universe--replacing
diminishing fossil fuels seems the stuff of fiction. Once, in fact, it
was: In 1870, Jules Verne's &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; described a world that
would one day derive &quot;an inexhaustible source of heat and light&quot; from
water's component parts.

<p>   Back then, Verne didn't realize that this source was also virtually
pollution-free. The cycle is so elegant it seems nearly miraculous:
Separate water into its two constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. Burn
the hydrogen for fuel, and it re-couples with oxygen to form water again.
No nasty particulates, no insidious carbon monoxide, no eye-stinging
ozone or sulfur dioxide (at high temperatures, however, small,
controllable amounts of nitrous oxides can form when hydrogen is burned
in the presence of air). Mainly, though, hydrogen's exhaust is plain
water vapor--which can then be recaptured and neatly converted again to
hydrogen.

<p>   According to Bill Hoagland, founder of NREL's hydrogen program, it
would take less than a gallon of water to get the same range from
hydrogen that cars currently get from a gallon of gasoline. Because
hydrogen can be made anywhere, I'm told repeatedly, there would be no
more dependency on imported oil. No more OPEC. Maybe no more global
warming, either, because it emits no greenhouse gases. As for hydrogen's
unfortunate association with bombs and blimps, like the ill-fated
Hindenburg, Hoagland reminds me that fossil fuels also readily explode,
and studies rate hydrogen safer because it's nontoxic and dissipates
quickly.

<p>   It seems like the perfect fuel. Yet, these scientists insist, it's
been under-researched, under-funded and virtually ignored in Detroit,
which perseveres in its allegiance to petroleum, and in Washington, which
persists in keeping troops ready to defend the Persian Gulf.

<p>   So why aren't we leaping at this chance to end pollution, energy wars
and economic bondage to a few privileged locations that float atop the
earth's ebbing supplies of oil?  Much of it comes down to money and the
seemingly incontestable reign of the petroleum industry. Unlike natural
gas, to which hydrogen is often compared, you can't dig a hole and find
it. To tap hydrogen's energy, you have to expend energy because it's
always combined with something else. Having to un-combine it makes it
more expensive, at least in the near term, than crude petroleum products,
including natural gas. And no alternative-energy constituency has the
clout to buck powerful fossil-fuel lobbies and find a way to pay for
retrofitting the world for a brand-new technology.

<p>   Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy allots hydrogen about
one-ninetieth of what it spends on continuing petroleum research. (And
two-thirds of the DOE's budget doesn't go for energy at all, but for
nuclear weapons research and cleanup.) Nor has the public thus far
demonstrated much interest in trading the ease of dirty energy, available
at the turn of an ignition key or click of a light switch, for a major
commitment to something cleaner and renewable.

<p>   Yet the learned crowd gathered at the World Hydrogen Conference is
convinced that hydrogen's time must come. Fossil fuels will become
expensive again; even today, their true price isn't revealed at the gas
pump, where the numbers don't include the cost of pollution and the
expense of protecting our interests in the Persian Gulf.

<p>   Other countries are less reluctant about hydrogen than the United
States. Two years ago, Japan, an island nation frightened by the prospect
of rising seas if the icecaps start to melt, unveiled a
multibillion-dollar, 28-year program to form a global hydrogen system.
The Japanese are talking power plants, cars, buses, planes, ships and
rockets, all over the world, all fueled with renewable hydrogen.

<p>   And there's a recent surprise announcement by Daimler-Benz, the parent
company of Mercedes-Benz, that has excited many people here: The German
auto maker claims it has cleared the major obstacles to producing the
first commercially viable hydrogen-powered automobile. Unless Mercedes is
just trying to spook the competition, hydrogen's prospects have suddenly
improved faster than anyone dared hope. The Mercedes in question runs on
a fuel cell, a refillable device that, like a battery, chemically
converts fuel directly to electricity without having to burn it. Fuel
cells can function on methanol or natural gas, but with hydrogen, they're
up to three times more efficient than conventional engines.

<p>   The most advanced models, including the one Daimler-Benz uses, come
from the Vancouver-based Ballard Power Systems Inc., which designed fuel
cells for the Canadian defense department, using technology NASA
developed for the Gemini mission and then shelved. Originally large, boxy
affairs of stackable metal plates separated by membranes resembling
plastic wrap, Ballard's fuel cells are now small enough to fit inside a
minivan chassis. &quot;When we start producing them in volume,&quot; says Ballard
co-founder Keith Prater, a former University of Texas chemist, &quot;the price
will shrink, too.&quot;

<p>   *

<p>   Surrounded by conference booths promoting the latest in photovoltaics,
fuel cells and electrolyzers--devices that separate water into oxygen and
hydrogen--I ask Princeton physicist Joan M. Ogden if the United States is
letting the future slip away to foreign competitors. She tells me of a
recent, unreleased General Motors study admitting that non-polluting fuel
cells could be mass-produced for the same cost as a conventional engine.
&quot;Actually, they should cost less, because they have no moving parts,&quot; she
says. &quot;They'll also last longer and be cheaper to maintain.&quot; But while
Mercedes, BMW and Mazda race to bring a hydrogen car to market, U.S. auto
makers, by comparison, don't seem very interested.

<p>   A few years ago, Ogden quit Princeton's glamorous fusion energy program to engage in relatively impoverished research in renewable hydrogen. &quot;Fusion will take decades,&quot; she told aghast colleagues. &quot;I want
results in my lifetime.&quot; Soon after, she co-authored a book that proposed
making hydrogen by splitting water with electricity from solar
photovoltaic (PV) cells. (In this process, as electricity made from
sunlight passes through a pair of electrodes immersed in water, hydrogen
bubbles collect around one pole and oxygen around another.) Although PV
is still expensive, Ogden argued that mass production and technological
improvements would lower costs until they intersect with rising oil
prices.

<p>   The book has been alternately praised and scorned, the latter because
of a map showing how much of the United States would have to be covered
by photovoltaic cells to produce sufficient hydrogen to meet the total
U.S. annual energy needs. The area is denoted by a circle that reaches
from Albuquerque nearly to the Mexican border. Critics who derisively try
to guess the value of all that real estate miss the point, she insists.
No one ever suggested putting all the PV in the same place.

<p>   &quot;Obviously, deserts are ideal, because they get the most sun, and
minimal rainfall is enough to make plenty of hydrogen. But I did a little
calculation once. Let's say 2,000 people who work at Princeton drive
there every day. If I wanted to run their cars on hydrogen, how much roof
space would I need to cover with PV to make enough hydrogen fuel for
them? I figured that by putting panels on fewer than half the university
rooftops, even with New Jersey's humble sunshine levels, we could convert
all those cars to hydrogen. Think if we did that all over the country.&quot;

<p>   That same afternoon, Peter Lehman, an environmental engineer from
Humboldt State University in Northern California, tells me what it would
take to do the same for the 9 million cars in the Los Angeles Basin: &quot;An
area about 340 square miles. About two-thirds the size, say, of Edwards
Air Force Base.&quot;

<p>   Cover Edwards Air Force Base with shiny photovoltaic panels?

<p>   &quot;Sure. It would mean a fairly dramatic reorientation of priorities,
and a huge expenditure, probably like building the interstate highway
system. That took $100 billion and 34 years. But we did it because as a
society we decided it was important. Wouldn't you think that eliminating
all smog might be important?&quot;

<p>   All week, people here have been repeating a mantra of massive American
investments in the future that paid off, like the Marshall Plan, the
interstate highway system and--especially during a pilgrimage to the old
Apollo launching pad--President Kennedy's decision to put men on the
moon. Although these ventures involved enormous expense, they were
embraced by the public because of visionary, daring leadership, but they
also coincided, rather than conflicted, with powerful interests. A
commitment to transform America's energy infrastructure to accommodate
clean hydrogen would, I suspect, evoke awesome resistance from the
petroleum and auto industries. And decisions these days seem dictated
more by the global marketplace than by the foresight of leaders.

<p>   Yet the one vision these scientists from Argentina, Egypt, Russia,
Germany and Japan tell me may save civilization from choking on its own
exhaust emanates from California. They refer specifically, and
reverently, to mandates by the California Air Resources Board and the
South Coast Air Quality Management District, which require that
zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) constitute 2% of all cars sold in the state
by 1998 and 10% by 2003.

<p>   The allure of these requirements is the fact that, with one out of 18
Americans living in the L.A. Basin alone, whoever can first manufacture a
viable car that meets this standard will get rich. Everybody assures me
that batteries aren't going to do it; the acceleration is rotten, the
range is too short, and they must be recharged by plugging into dirty
power plants that only shift the pollution elsewhere. The assumption here
is that the only way to build a real ZEV is by using a hydrogen fuel
cell, and California's regulations will help force that technology into
existence. The air quality district's chief scientist, Alan Lloyd, who's
speaking at the conference, agrees.

<p>   Lloyd's problem, though, is that he is not exactly considered a
prophet in his own land. Rather than instilling native pride,
California's world champion air-quality laws, which some believe have
wrecked the state's economy, have barely survived legislative plots to
scuttle them.

<p>   And despite the vaunted environmental pedigree of Vice President Al
Gore, the Clinton Administration hasn't been much help either. While a
few projects like experimental wind farms have been encouraged, federal
efforts have focused more on improving energy efficiency than on
developing clean new sources. Most frustrating to Alan Lloyd is a
multimillion-dollar Administration program called PNGV: the Partnership
for a New Generation of Vehicles, whose goal is to deliver a prototype
car that gets triple today's expected gas mileage--about 80 miles per
gallon--by the year 2004.   &quot;Which means that after 10 years, they'll
develop a vehicle that will be illegal in California because it's too
dirty,&quot; he says, gazing heavenward. &quot;That's unacceptable. A
new-generation vehicle should be fuel-efficient  and  clean.
Leadership should come from the White House, but their agenda is being
driven more from Detroit.&quot;

<p>   Other energy advocates claim the technology for an 80-m.p.g. vehicle
already exists, but the Administration has simply caved in to the Big
Three auto makers and the oil industry. But since I haven't seen filling
stations dispensing hydrogen on American street corners, I ask Lloyd if a
fuel-cell vehicle designed to run on the stuff is really practical.

<p>   In the interim, there are lots of ways to make hydrogen besides solar
 energy, Lloyd explains. Using steam, it can be derived from natural gas
or even mixed with it--known as town gas, that was what America once
burned for light and cooking. Hydrogen improves the potency and lowers
the emissions of natural gas, and with some modification it might even be
shipped through natural gas pipelines. As for a dearth of service
stations: a similar alarm was once sounded by buggy-whip manufacturers.

<p>   The real obstacle, Lloyd says, is America's current lust to pawn the
future for the sake of profits today. &quot;While Detroit hires 100 attorneys
to defeat every new emissions standard we establish, Japan assigns 1,000
engineers to meet the challenge.&quot;

<p>   Maintaining energy's status quo might make some sense, or at least
some money, for purveyors of petroleum and internal-combustion engines.
But the conference's keynote speaker assures us that the decision won't
really be theirs. University of Colorado physicist emeritus Albert A.
Bartlett says he knows little about hydrogen but something about basic
arithmetic. He's particularly drawn to calculating the time it takes for
things to double. This is pertinent, he says, to consumption of fossil
fuels, because it allows the petroleum and coal industries to deceive the
world about how long those resources will actually last.

<p>   To illustrate what he means, he proposes that we imagine a species of
bacteria that reproduces by dividing in two. Those two become four, the
four become eight, and so forth.  &quot;Let's say we place one bacterium in a
bottle at 11 a.m, and at noon we observe the bottle to be full. At what
point was it half full?&quot; The answer, it turns out, is 11:59 a.m.

<p>   &quot;Now, if you were a bacterium in that bottle, at what point would you
realize you were running out of space? At 11:55 a.m, when the bottle is
only one-thirty-seconds full, and 97% is open space, yearning for
development?&quot;

<p>   Everyone giggles. &quot;Now suppose, with a minute to spare, the bacteria
discover three new bottles to inhabit. They sigh with relief: They have
three times more bottles than had ever been known, quadrupling their
space resource. Surely this makes them self-sufficient in space. Right?&quot;

<p>   Except, of course, it doesn't. Bartlett's point is that in exactly two
more minutes, all four bottles will be full. Likewise, when President
Jimmy Carter noted that in each of three previous decades the world had
burned more fuel than had been consumed previously in all of history, it
meant that fuel consumption was doubling every decade. That rate slowed
temporarily with the energy crisis, but now, with world population rising
and today's breakneck industrialization in the Third World, the
exponential gobbling of limited resources is again accelerating.

<p>   &quot;It's seriously misleading when we hear, for example, that at current
levels of output and recovery coal reserves can be expected to last 500
years. We get the mistaken impression that there's 500 years' worth of
coal left, forgetting that the sentence began with 'at current levels.'
That's 500 years, only if there's no growth of production.&quot;

<p>   And petroleum? &quot;In 1993, they announced the largest discovery of oil
in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 20 years: 700 million barrels. It
sounds like an enormous number, until you realize that we Americans go
through roughly 17.7 million barrels a day. Divide 700 by 17.7. It'll
last about 40 days.&quot;

<p>   The auditorium is now silent. &quot;That indicates,&quot; he tells us, &quot;that
we've already made the big petroleum discoveries. Now we're picking
around the edges, getting the last ones.&quot;

<p>   *

<p>   In 1975, during the depths of the energy crisis, Tom Harkin arrived in
Washington as an Iowa congressman. In his first year on the House Science
and Technology Committee, he decided that the threat to the future of energy  was genuine. Then Carter was elected President, and, to Harkin's
relief, the Administration began dispensing billions and creating
incentives for solar, photovoltaic, wind and ocean thermal energy.

<p>   Then the next President, Ronald Reagan, dismantled Carter's
solar-heating apparatus on the White House roof and all the tax breaks
and funding for alternative-energy research along with it. During those
lean years, Harkin, now a senator, joined forces with longtime hydrogen
zealot Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga of Hawaii to convince whomever they could
that hydrogen wasn't some dumb fantasy. After Matsunaga's death in 1990,
Harkin and the only other hydrogen devotees around, Reps. George E. Brown
Jr. (D-Colton) and Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.),
pushed through a five-year research bill in his memory.

<p>   The appropriation was minimal, but after Clinton and Gore were
elected, Harkin was sure that would change. Shortly after their
inauguration, he presented the new Administration with a 40-page proposal
for a sustainable energy future based on hydrogen. It showed how, by
using solar photovoltaic electricity to split water, hydrogen actually
becomes a way to store the power of the sun, because it can be burned at
night or shipped to cold climates where solar energy is scarce. It
explained that the cheapest way to produce hydrogen could be through
&quot;electro-farming&quot;: using marginal land to grow energy crops like switch
grass, which could be reduced to hydrogen in a simple device called a
biomass gasifier. The gasifier, in turn, would run on excess heat from a
hydrogen fuel cell, providing power for the farm.

<p>   Harkin also rebutted the myth that hydrogen is more dangerous than
traditional fuels, a belief dating to the 1937 explosion that destroyed
the German airship Hindenburg. The 36 who died, he explained, were killed
in the fall, not from burning hydrogen, which simply floated away (as it
would have had the Exxon Valdez transported hydrogen instead of oil). In
fact, the 61 Hindenburg survivors would not have lived had the blimp
carried natural gas.

<p>   But, Harkin concluded, in order to make fuel cells or hydrogen cars
affordable, they have to be mass-produced, and before manufacturers will
mass-produce them, delivery systems--hydrogen pumps at the corner gas
station--have to be in place. That won't happen until there's mass demand
for them, and so on. This classic chicken-and-egg dilemma, he argued,
could be resolved by a federal commitment to a comfortable transition
from fossil fuels.

<p>   He didn't get very far. &quot;I told the President he should grab the
public's imagination the way Kennedy did with the moon shot, by
announcing in his first State of the Union speech that the U.S. was going
all out for hydrogen and fuel cells. He looked at me like I was slightly
nuts.&quot;

<p>   Later Harkin ran into Al Gore in the Executive Office Building. If the
government purchased large quantities of photovoltaics, he told the vice
president, it would lower the cost immensely. The same for fuel cells. No
luck there, either. Instead, the tiny hydrogen coalition in Congress
actually has had to fight the Administration's proposed cuts in funding
provided by the Matsunaga Act.

<p>   In Washington, Harkin's hydrogen consultant, Sandy Thomas, shows me a
chart of the Department of Energy' s budget. Out of $18.6 billion, $10
billion goes for nuclear-weapons research and cleanup. &quot;That's even
though we aren't building nuclear weapons anymore. It's an
upper-middle-class welfare program for nuclear scientists. Then there's
nearly $1 billion for fossil-fuel research and conservation, even though
they're running out; $300 million for atomic fission, though we've
stopped building nuclear reactors, and nearly half a billion for fusion,
the practical application of which even its most optimistic proponents
admit is at least 40 years away.&quot;

<p>   &quot;And for hydrogen research?&quot;I ask.

<p>   &quot;Ten million.&quot;

<p>   I gape. &quot;I know,&quot; he says. &quot;We've argued for shifting even $100
million out of DOE's nuclear-weapons fund. But those decisions are made
at the top. It's hard to get Hazel O'Leary's ear on this one.&quot;

<p>   At a White House conference on environmental technology in December,
chaired by Gore, Energy Secretary O'Leary admits to me that in the wake
of a new Republican Congress that threatens to cut not just budgets but
the entire DOE, she questions the wisdom of bankrolling fusion. On
hydrogen, however, she doesn't yield. &quot;I'm not an apologist for
traditional energy. We've backed some exciting research into wind power.
But my strong opinion is that hydrogen isn't there yet. We have to be
willing to deliver more mature technologies to market first. Excepting
fusion, I think our investments fairly represent the energy marketplace
for the near and midterm.&quot;

<p>   At the conference, Gore, five Cabinet officers and President Clinton's
science adviser meet with 1,400 industrialists, entrepreneurs and
environmental representatives to discuss how the U.S. can prosper in the
growing international market for clean, green technology. There are
seminars on environmental export financing and transitions to industrial
ecology--yet barely any mention of energy, except for a small workshop on
fuel cells and another on transportation technologies.

<p>   In the latter, I join a study group chaired by Ford's representative
for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. Among the points
we're asked to consider are the prospects for introducing alternative
fuels like hydrogen for motor vehicles in the near future. The first to
speak up is General Motors' federal research coordinator. &quot;Very dim. As
long as gas and diesel stay around $1.20, consumers have no incentive to
use anything else.&quot; Alternative fuels, he says, all lack the energy density of petroleum, so it will always cost more to get the same amount
of power.

<p>   No one contradicts him, so Ford moves on to the next question. I
interrupt. &quot;Wait. Isn't the whole reason for this conference the idea
that consumer demand today involves things other than price, such as
products that don't pollute us to death?&quot;

<p>   &quot;I'll believe that,&quot; GM replies, &quot;when Californians start buying the
50 miles-per-gallon vehicles that are already available. The fact is,
they don't want cars that are more efficient or cleaner.&quot;

<p>   *

<p>   &quot;So how would you get people to buy this thing?&quot; I yell to Thomas
Klaiber, but he doesn't hear me, because a low-slung, Class C racing
series model and a black, V-12 600SL roar past us at that instant, one on
either side. We're on the Mercedes-Benz test track in Stuttgart, Germany.
Klaiber, a mechanical engineer, is head of the Daimler-Benz hydrogen fuel
cell group; the van he's driving is the hydrogen-powered vehicle that
prompted Mercedes' grand announcement.

<p>   If this is really the future we're driving into, at a top cruising
speed of 50 miles per hour, it's a little like riding the tortoise while
being passed by a flock of jeering hares. Even Mercedes buses are passing
us as we negotiate banked curves and climb steep little hills that
suddenly appear in the middle of the straightways. Yet the van itself
feels surprisingly normal. Amid the surrounding internal combustion
thunder, the most noticeable difference is how quietly it runs. The fuel
cell itself makes no sound. There's only the hum of an air compressor.

<p>   Some significant technological challenges remain unmet, however. Much
of the cargo area is filled with fiberglass pressure tanks. Although
hydrogen has up to three times the efficiency of gasoline, its lightness
gives it such low density that even when compressed, its storage requires
at least four times the space of a conventional gas tank. This is fine
for the fuel-cell buses that Ballard Power Systems is operating
successfully in Vancouver, because there's plenty of room on their roofs
to store hydrogen. To partly alleviate this problem for passenger cars,
Daimler-Benz plans to shrink the fuel cell to one-fourth its current
size, even as it increases horsepower.

<p>   &quot;The alternative is we store the hydrogen in metal hydrides,&quot; Klaiber
says, referring to a process in which certain metals absorb hydrogen like
a sponge, then release it when heated.   &quot;They're fine for commuter cars;
citizens tested a fleet for us in Berlin for four years. But for a range
of 250 miles, you'd need a ton of hydride. Too much.&quot;

<p>   I have just come from Munich, where I rode in a silver 7-Series BMW
that uses a third storage option: liquid hydrogen, exactly like the space
shuttle. Its ride, acceleration, speed and internal combustion engine
made it virtually indistinguishable from a regular car. Underneath the
chassis, however, was a double-walled tank to keep the fuel at -423
degrees F. But even with that much insulation, too much hydrogen boils
off after three days, making it impractical, say, to leave a liquid
hydrogen car in an airport parking lot during summer.

<p>   Plus, it takes one-third the energy of hydrogen to cool it to a liquid
state. So the simplicity and high efficiency of fuel cells, which run at
normal temperatures, seem to be winning the race to the future--whenever
that is.

<p>   Riding with Klaiber, it doesn't feel distant. His face is glowing,
almost cherubic. He confesses that he loves driving this thing just
because he knows it's so clean.

<p>   We pull over. He doesn't turn off the engine but finds a paper cup and
holds it over the exhaust pipe. &quot;Drink?&quot; he offers.

<p>   It's pure, distilled water.

<p>   *

<p>   Consumers, I'm told by hydrogen skeptics, won't buy a vehicle whose
power and performance fall short of what we've grown to expect from our
automobiles. In the Daimler-Benz headquarters, Mercedes' vice president
of marketing for passenger cars, Jochen Placking, shows me a typical ad
they use for the United States: a convertible speeding across a New
Mexico desert. &quot;We're selling freedom. The limitless power to go
explore.&quot;

<p>   In the halls here, decades of Mercedes advertising posters show women
with long, shapely legs protruding from fur coats, leaning against
gorgeous roadsters. How can you make an environmentally correct car into
a sexy status symbol, like a sports coupe?

<p>   Placking strokes his mustache. &quot;We'll have to find a way to make clean
cars fascinating,&quot; he says. &quot;Like selling people on safe sex.&quot;

<p>   It's not an altogether encouraging analogy, especially in the context.
Germany, world leader in hydrogen research investment--about $12 million
a year since the late 1970s until it was blindsided by the expense of
reunification--is hardly the renewable-energy economy I imagined. An
official from the state of Bavaria's electric utility, which has the
world's biggest hydrogen pilot facility, admits there are no plans to
scale up to a full-sized working plant. So what will they do in 30 years,
when Bavaria's aging nuclear plants must be phased out and fossil fuels
are expected to be scarce?

<p>   &quot;I can't answer that question. Nobody can. Nobody gives a damn about
the future.&quot;

<p>   Back in my own country, I share this story with Michael Heben, a lanky
young materials scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Even at BMW and Daimler-Benz, I tell him, hydrogen only gets a small
chunk of the research budget compared to conventional engines. I suppose
it's not in a company's interest to invent something that renders its
most successful product obsolete.

<p>   Heben shrugs. He reminds me we've seen computers grow smaller, faster
and cheaper at a breathless pace, all because a couple of kids in a
garage dared to try to build something better. When Edison was inventing
light bulbs and phonographs, electricity cost 300 times what it does now.
As soon as people saw what it could do, they started using it en masse,
and the price became practical. Maybe, he suggests, one key discovery
will do the same for hydrogen--like the semiconductor work of John
Turner, who's splitting water without the intermediate step of first
making photovoltaic electricity.

<p>   Other researchers here are cultivating strains of algae that exhale
hydrogen. Heben himself is after a revolutionary way to store it. He's
trying to prove that submicroscopic tubes made of activated carbon,
developed at IBM, suck up hydrogen atoms via capillary action, like a
straw. A fuel tank full of the tough, light tubules, each about a
billionth of a meter in diameter, could actually hold far more diffuse
hydrogen gas than a tank that was empty.

<p>   &quot;Our goal should be a vehicle that performs like today's cars: same
size, weight, acceleration, frequency of refueling. With good, compact, energy-efficient storage, there's no reason we can't do that with clean
hydrogen.&quot;

<p>   On NREL's lean hydrogen budget, he's currently able to create enough
of a soot-like substance, which contains carbon nanotubules, to oat the
inside of a countertop bell jar. To scale up to working size will cost a
lot more. At this point, he has no idea where funds will come from, but
something makes him believe they will.

<p>   &quot;We're so close. So much has been accomplished with just a little. If
we really decided that we wanted a clean hydrogen economy, we could have
it by 2010. No more oil spills. Fresh air in Denver and L.A. Think of
it.&quot;

<p>   Maybe he's right. Curiously, amid panic over Republican threats to
dismember research budgets, hydrogen may prove to be not just a survivor
but also a winner. The new chairman of the House Committee on Science is
Bob Walker, longtime science mentor to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
hydrogen ally of Tom Harkin.

<p>   In his office, decorated with pictures of the space shuttle, Walker
reminds me that one of the most powerful forces in the marketplace is
&quot;the love Americans have for roaming the planet freely in their own cars.
Hydrogen will make that possible when the present technology gets too
dirty to extend into the future.&quot; He has introduced legislation calling
for a quadrupling of research funds for hydrogen over the next three
years. Part of the money will be matched by non-federal sources and part
expropriated from technologies Walker believes are either futile or
outmoded.

<p>   He has little pity for industries that resist change, including auto
makers. &quot;If Edison were to invent the light bulb today, the headlines
would read, '200,000 candle makers lose their jobs.' We've been through
this before, like when cars put blacksmiths out of business. It's
wrenching, but overall our national competitiveness gets stronger. The
same thing will happen in energy. The people themselves will demand it.&quot;

<p>   He pauses to gaze at a plaque naming him the latest recipient of the
National Hydrogen Assn.'s Spark M. Matsunaga Award. &quot;Driving on the
interstate, I watch them stringing fiber-optic cable up the median strip
for the Internet. The government talks about the Internet but can't come
up with a structure. Meantime, it's happening because people want it.
When they realize they need clean hydrogen, somebody will find a way to
supply that, too.&quot;
