<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey has further lessened the risk of Japanese monetary policy being tightened this autumn.  The survey showed a small decline in business confidence compared to widespread expectations that it would continue the uptrend which began late last year.  The survey indicates that Japan's manufacturing inventory adjustment is not yet over and that growth during the second half of 1996 will be far more subdued than it was during the first half.  The yen/dollar rate has been stable during recent weeks, but the MOF will probably attempt to encourage renewed dollar strength during the run-up to the IMF meetings in early October.  
<P>
The recovery of Robert Dole in the opinion polls  after the Republican convention and the selection of Jack Kemp as his vice-presidential running mate has helped to lessen investor concern about a potential Democratic sweep of both the presidential and congressional elections.  While the President continues to enjoy nearly a ten point lead over Mr. Dole, the Republicans are now only slightly behind the Democrats in opinion polls for the congress.
<P>
The decision of Mr. Dole to link his campaign so firmly to the theme of tax cuts suggests that if he scores an upset victory in the November election, the dollar will probably rally in expectation of the U.S. experiencing a replay of the fiscal policy of the early Reagan years. 
<P>
Investors remember that during the early 1980's the dollar rose sharply because the expansion of the federal deficit against the backdrop of a restrictive monetary policy required the U.S. to become a large scale capital importer.  It is doubtful, though that the Dole fiscal policy will have nearly as dramatic an impact on the dollar as the Reagan fiscal policy.  
<P>
First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts.  This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it.  Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to a high deficit fiscal policy.  The ratio of federal debt to GDP in the U.S. is now about 55% compared to only 28% when Mr. Reagan took office, so the initial conditions for a major fiscal reflation are much less suitable than they were in 1981. 
<P>
Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part.  The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending.  If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing.  But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates.  The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform.
