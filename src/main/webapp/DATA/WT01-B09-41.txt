<P>
When it comes to advanced technologies, America must remain the leader.  Technology innovation is the cornerstone of continually modernizing our military - and maintaining our ability to compete in the world economy.
	Whether the battlefield is military or economic, our future success depends on a new generation of combat vehicle capabilities - hard to detect, easy to deploy and support, fast and maneuverable.
<P>




<b>A Partnership That Works</b> 
	<p>In a unique, results-oriented partnership with industry, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is successfully accelerating America's technical progress in advanced vehicles.  The vehicle on this cover - and the technologies highlighted in this report - are examples of that fast track progress.</p>

<blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96d.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96c.gif"></a><center><b>This HMMWV (Humvee) operates on a quiet, powerful, efficient hybrid-electric  drive system.

	<p>This HMMWV (Humvee) operates on a quiet, powerful, efficient hybrid-electric  drive system.  It represents the face of our future.  And it's being built now.</p> 

<b>A Clear Need</b>
<p>Through seven regional technology consortia (listed below), DARPA's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Technology Program has structured the teams to rapidly spur technology advances for leading-edge products.  It is encouraging teams of companies to make them, building the civilian manufacturing support structure to ensure costs are kept low and capabilities high.</p>
	<p>DARPA sees a clear need for new military capabilities.  Future combat vehicles bring greatly increased electrical power requirements for weapons, sensors and defensive systems.  To provide that power while staying highly mobile, DARPA is combining power generation for these systems and propulsion into one system - hybrid electric.</p>
	<p>It means smaller engines running at peak efficiency.  Reduced thermal and acoustic signatures.  A doubling of fuel economy for sustainability in the field.  Lighter-weight, faster and easier to deploy vehicles.  And integrated systems with reduced cost.</p>  
	  
<b>Results Count</b> 
	<p>Through private industry cost-shared projects, the seven DARPA consortia operate a vast range of innovative research, development and deployment programs in all regions of the nation, each pushing forward advanced electric and hybrid electric vehicle technologies.</p>	
<p>What has our unique partnership accomplished?  On the broadest level, the DARPA consortia have proven out a new model for rapid technology development.  By maximizing both cooperation and competition among a skills-rich network of companies, research organizations, labs and universities spanning America, the best technologies are encouraged, quickly developed and tested.  This innovative approach has been recognized for its success by the prestigious Hudson Institute.</p>
	<p>That's the model.  What physical projects can we point to?</p>  
	<p>The pages of this report chronicle significant progress across a range of critical technology areas: </p> 
<ul>
<li><p>You'll find key, "enabling" technologies for electric and hybrid vehicles - such as low-cost power electronics.</p>  
<li><p>You'll discover a staggering array of new, efficient energy generators for hybrid vehicles - from turbogenerators to fuel cells to rotary-engine generators.</p>  
<li><p>You'll see real improvements in energy storage - from advanced lead-acid batteries to flywheel "mechanical" batteries to supercapacitors. </p> 
<li><p>You'll learn about new light-weight, high-strength materials for vehicle bodies and chassis.</p>  
<li><p>And you'll see full vehicle "integrations" - from a new military scout vehicle to Humvees to Bradley fighting vehicles, as well as a range of new clean and efficient civilian vehicles from commuter cars to buses, all able to tap the same technology base.
</p></ul> 
   
<b>Meeting Multiple Missions</b>
	<p>What each of these innovative technology projects share is that each is a part of a broader whole.  The DARPA Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program is a flexible yet highly coordinated effort to push forward critical vehicle performance goals through increased power generation, improved energy storage, reduced weight and enhanced efficiencies.</p>  
	<p>Please read our report of progress.  We think you'll find a program showing results quickly, cost-efficiently and with an eye toward meeting multiple missions -- from improved military capabilities, to reducing oil imports and enhancing energy security, to meeting critical clean air standards.  These are missions with a future.</p>

<b>What is DARPA?</b>

	<p>DARPA stands for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the guardian of the future for the Department of Defense.</p>
	<p>Ever heard of the Internet?  DARPA
invented it.</p> 
	<p>Designed to link national labs and researchers, it's fast becoming the global model for civilian communication and commerce.  And DARPA placed America squarely in the middle of the future.</p>
	<p>DARPA's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program has the same goal.  Future combat vehicles need to be stealthy, nimble and carry a huge electronic punch.  Recognizing that civilian vehicles increasingly need similar technologies to cut air pollution and reduce dependence on foreign oil, DARPA launched a program to encourage those technologies to be developed and built in the United States.</p>
	<p>The track record to date?  Over 350 American companies are working together - and in competition with each other - to push the limits of energy storage, drive system efficiency and high-power electronics for combat vehicles.</p>
	<p>Maybe just as important - companies around the world are now launching into these same technologies.  That's a sign of their importance and a testament to DARPA's scanning of future needs.</p>
	<p>Just as with the Internet, DARPA is giving us the early lead.  Now we must maintain it, to keep the edge in military capabilities and to carve out another area of commercial leadership in the global market.<P></p></ul>
