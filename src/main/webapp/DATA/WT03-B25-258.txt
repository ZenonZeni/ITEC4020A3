<H2>2. ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES (continued)<BR>
<HR></H2>
<H3><A NAME="anchor15385045"></A>2.8 Structure</H3>
The EOC structure within COSSA has the nature of a Program in a Division.
It has a Science Program Leader, support for the Program Leader and a range
of activities, or tasks that are the Working Groups, Science Projects and/or
Implementation Teams defined above. Fundamental to its operation is the
peer review and advice its Science Panel will provide.<BR>
<BR>
The Tasks will be defined and managed to have a beginning, middle and end
with defined goals and measures of satisfactory completion in an appropriate
time frame and (where appropriate) against the benefits to the applications
oriented Threads. The definition of these measures in the case of strategic
research will be carefully considered to take into account the open ended
and risky nature of such activity and in the case of data management the
need for continuity.<BR>
<BR>
The seven main areas for administration and management of EOC activities
are illustrated in the following chart:<BR>
<BR>
The research Tasks are grouped and monitored within four primary 'Focus'
areas for generic Earth Observation Science within which issues such as
the following may be researched: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Application Support Focus<BR>
<BR>
</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>Tools and Methods for:<BR>
<BR>
    <UL>
    <LI>Global change 
    <LI>Forestry &amp; forests applications 
    <LI>Ocean, coastal &amp; inland waters 
    <LI>Crops, pastures &amp; soils 
    <LI>Geology &amp; minerals<BR>
<BR>
    </UL>
  </UL>
<LI><B>Measurement Models Focus<BR>
<BR>
</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>Calibration &amp; validation 
  <LI>Geomatic measurement 
  <LI>Atmospheric modelling &amp; characterisation 
  <LI>Earth surface targets models 
  <LI>Field &amp; laboratory procedures<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><B>Data Systems Focus<BR>
<BR>
</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>Archive &amp; Access methodology 
  <LI>Common processing software 
  <LI>Data integration methods 
  <LI>Measurement libraries 
  <LI>Data security<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><B>Sensor Systems Focus<BR>
<BR>
</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>Imaging spectrometer support 
  <LI>Space &amp; airborne instruments 
  <LI>Field instrumentation 
  <LI>Space engineering interface 
  </UL>
</UL>
These, together with three more general areas of 
<UL>
<LI><B>Program Support</B>, 
<LI><B>National and International Scientific Interaction</B> and 
<LI><B>Application Oriented Thread Coordination</B> 
</UL>
comprise seven areas which provide a more aggregated and persisting basis
for project and financial planning and management.<BR>
<BR>
The overall coordination of the Tasks and their interface with the applications
oriented Threads will be the job of the Science Program Leader. It will
take account of the major Threads that lead to the development of the Tasks
and whose end products represent the interests of Applications Oriented
Divisional and other clients as well as the specific scientific focus within
which the Tasks are carried out.<BR>
<BR>
The tasks in the Focus Areas will be developed from Threads of activity
that are involved in Earth Observation products and will be approved according
to a well defined and explicit priority setting process. The greatest investment
of EOC base funds will generally be to the Science Projects of each area
with Working Groups only needing adequate support for travel, accommodation
and reporting and Implementation Teams expected to have highest client support.<BR>
<BR>
The specific functions of the areas are:<BR>
<BR>
1. <B>Program Support</B> - Office management, records, information technology
and support services for the Program as well as client reporting and task
coordination to meet the needs of the Threads;<BR>
<BR>
2. <B>National and International Science Interaction</B> - Area cooperating
with COSSA role which supports specific scientific input and involvement
by EOC scientists in these aspects;<BR>
<BR>
3. <B>Applications Oriented Thread Coordination</B> - Area involved in seeking
external views on the relationships between the focus markets and the technical
Tasks and ensuring that these are served by Task coordination.<BR>
<BR>
4. <B>Application Support Focus</B> - Deals with remote sensing science
support of the applications being addressed by Divisions and EOC contributing
groups. This Focus works at the end of the Threads nearest the end user
or Divisional client;<BR>
<BR>
5. <B>Measurement Models Focus</B> - Deals with information and standard
product derivation, calibration and validation from Earth Observation data.
Includes issues of atmospheric correction, land, water and atmospheric modelling
and measuremnts as well as advanced product definition;<BR>
<BR>
6. <B>Data Systems Focus</B> - Deals with the generic science issues of
data access, management and communication and the software base for the
production of products and research infrastructure. Also provides access
for Divisions and contributing groups to data not available from other suppliers.<BR>
<BR>
7. <B>Sensor Systems Focus</B> - Deals with the development and specification
of sensor systems, instrumentation for Earth Observation and supporting
site measurements and provides an interface with the Sensor Systems industry.<BR>
<BR>
To provide accounting and management, a scientist will be responsible for
each of these areas. This EOC staff member is charged with reporting activity
and maintaining a watch on progress against goals and accounts but will
not have line management responsibility for staff or tasks in the focus
areas. Task leaders will provide leadership and have primary responsibility
for the task activities and (with respect to EOC tasks) be responsible to
the Science Program Leader of the EOC.<BR>
