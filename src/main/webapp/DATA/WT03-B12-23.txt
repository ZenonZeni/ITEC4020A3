AT&T OFFERS TOLL-FREE DIRECTORY

Directory assistance via telephone costs money.  If you're trying to 
find a toll-free number for a specific company, make the free AT&T 
Toll-Free 800 Directory on the Web at 
"http://www.tollfree.att.net/dir800/" a first choice.
 
You can use the built-in search engine to locate a specific company, 
yellow-page category, or geographic location.  You can also use the 
service much like a traditional yellow-page directory, browsing by 
category.  They range from "Abdominal Supports" and "Abortion 
Alternatives" to "Zippers" and "Zoos."

HOW TO GET LEGISLATIVE HISTORIES

In IFR's "Directory of Key Federal Government World Wide Web and 
Gopher Sites," on page 5, we list the Library of Congress' Thomas.  
It's the place to go for:
 
Full text of congressional legislation.
Full text of the Congressional Record.
Congressional Record index.
Bill Summary and Status for the 104th Congress.
 
These resources are among your best sources for tracking the 
legislative history of any bills pending or passed by either or both 
houses of Congress.
 
Get step-by-step instructions on how to use this resource at the 
Legislative Research with Thomas site.  It's on the Web at 
"http://www.clark.net/pub/lschank/mythomas.txt".

TEN THOUSAND DATA FILES FROM FEDWORLD

The FedWorld FTP site, a service of the Commerce Department's 
National Technical Information Service, may now be accessed through 
an easy-to-use intermediary Web site, located at 
"http://www.fedworld.gov/ftp.htm".
 
From here you can locate-through a search engine or browsing-more 
than 10,000 data files produced by federal government agencies.  A 
directory index is updated daily.
 
Especially valuable at this time of year, both for businesses and 
individuals, is the extensive collection of Internal Revenue Service 
forms and instructions.  Other extensive collections include those 
offered by the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of 
Commerce, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Treasury 
Department, and Securities Exchange Commission.  Other federal 
government agency offerings are also included.

SEARCH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANUAL

Some researchers overlook the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA), considering it a repository of historical 
rather than current information.
 
But tucked within NARA's Web site is a highly useful information 
resource, the 1995/96 edition of The United States Government Manual.  
You can reach it directly at 
"http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/nara001.html".
 
A built-in search engine lets you search for exact phrases.  You may 
also use "AND," "OR," and "NOT" for locating precisely the 
information you seek.
 
The Manual contains detailed descriptions and contact information for 
every federal government agency.

ZERO-IN ON COMPANY NEWS FROM NEW JERSEY

For business researchers, one of the major boons of the World Wide Web 
is easy and quick access to the electronic pages of local newspapers.  
For the first time, they're as accessible as the best-known national 
and international dailies and weeklies.
 
For company information, they often scoop their larger-circulation 
relatives and as a rule provide more in-depth coverage.
 
One recent addition to the growing Web collection of locals is BUSINESS 
News New Jersey.  Its electronic home is at "http://www.njbiz.com/" and 
provides the full text of highly focused articles on specific companies 
in that state and many other business-related news and feature items.

A NOTE ABOUT GUEST BOOKS

An increasing number of sites are requiring users to provide 
information in "guest books" before linking to the information 
provided.  There's generally nothing apparently wrong with this.
 
But IFR readers should be aware that in many cases this is a prelude 
to soliciting paid subscriptions.  Some sites will start by offering 
free access then-after an adequate user base is achieved-contact 
registrants to indicate that future access will require an annual 
subscription fee.

IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE

Spring hasn't quite sprung yet in many parts of the country.  But 
after surviving what for many has been a cabin-fever-filled winter, 
folks are itching to take advantage of the first Spring-like days.
 
A popular early Spring mini-outing is a trip to the zoo.  And you can 
get a taste of it and plan your itinerary via the World Wide Web.
 
A first stop could be the San Diego Zoo.  It's located at 
"http://www.sandiegozoo.org/", and its home page features 
descriptions and photos from many of its attractions.
 
Another western must is Portland, Oregon's Metro Washington Park Zoo.  
You'll find its photo gallery packed with pictures of some 50 
attractions.  Click on over to 
"http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/".
 
Moving East, drop in at the Pittsburgh Zoo for an excellent section on 
wildlife and information on its "Kids Kingdom," especially designed for 
youth-and the young at heart, too.  It's at 
"http://keyselections.lm.com/info.html".
 
If your taste leans toward the aquatic, don't miss Sea World at Busch 
Gardens.  In addition to an extensive photo index, this electronic zoo 
boasts a wealth of educational material.  It's at 
"http://www.bev.net/education/SeaWorld/homepage.html".
