	The Foundation for Exceptional Children (FEC) is a national organization committed to improving the 
lives of children and youth with disabilities.  For 26 years, the Foundation's mission has been to design 
and implement programs that help to improve the quality of life of children and youth with disabilities.  FEC, 
through the administration of several national programs and through personal contact with organizations 
participating in these programs has recognized a pattern of need.<p> 
<b>Organizational Background and Capacity</b><p> 
	The Foundation for Exceptional Children was created as a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization 
in June, 1971.  The mission of the Foundation is to encourage, enhance and empower children and youth with 
disabilities and/or gifted and talented children to obtain their greatest potential.  The Foundation's objectives are: 
to encourage children and youth with disabilities to achieve to the best of their abilities and to recognize the 
achievement of these persons; to promote quality education and assist youth with disabilities to successfully 
make the transition from school to adult life and to succeed in competitive employment, independent living and a 
higher quality of life; to raise the awareness of the general public to the value, worth and abilities of children and 
youth with disabilities and to strive toward empowerment of persons with disabilities to attain a high quality of 
life through removal of barriers, better education, advocacy and involvement in general social activities.<p> 
	The Foundation is an organization small in staff numbers but large in national impact. It has initiated 
and administered many programs to achieve its objectives including:<p> 
	<b>Conference on the Culturally Gifted Child</b>--a national conference to develop guidelines for 
creation of programs which would help all gifted children reach their greatest potential with a special sensitivity 
for the need and abilities of gifted children from minority groups.<p> 
	<b>A Primer on Individualized Education Programs for Handicapped Children</b>-developed and 
published a text in order to provide special and general educators with an understanding of the elements of the 
Individualized Education Program (IEP) for handicapped children as required by Public Law 94-142.  The 
Education for All Handicapped Children Act.<p> 
	<b>Incarcerated Handicapped Youth Project</b>-a technical assistance 
project in two penal institutions 
in the Washington, D.C. area for the purpose of improving educational programs for 1500 local youth 
incarcerated in juvenile facilities<p> 
	<b>"Yes I Care!"</b>-recognizes adults for their special commitment and achievement in support of all 
disabled youth.  Senators Harkin and Dole have received the award in recognition of their sponsorship of the 
ADA legislation.<p> 
	The <b>"Yes I Can!"</b> program provides International awards for 
achievement in academics, the arts, 
independent living, athletics, community service, employment, and 
extracurricular activities.  This International 
program has been funded by the Shell Oil Company Foundation, Fearon Corporation, and the Neil Smith 
Foundation.  The budget includes a replica of a statue designed by a nationally known sculptor, Michael 
Naranjo, which is presented to each of the winners.  The nominees are recruited through the media and print 
journals.  The winners are chosen by a committee and are invited to the 
national convention of the Council for 
Exceptional Children, an organization for teachers of special education. The statues are presented in a special 
ceremony which often includes television and cinema personalities as well as professional athletes.  A reception 
is held to honor the winners, parents and teachers of the winners.  All students nominated are recognized with a 
certificate from FEC.  At this time more than 20,000 children and youth have been recognized through this 
program.<p> 
	<b>Team Work </b>is a national program which helps prepare and find jobs for youth with disabilities 
by pairing them with volunteer mentors from business and industry.  The $250,000 start up budget was funded 
by four foundations with continuing support from more than 50 corporations and foundations.  Some major 
contributors were the Pew Trust, Dole Foundation, Knight Foundation and the Mitsubishi Electric America 
Foundation.   It was designed to be replicating and self-sustaining.  The project is presently on going at 10-12 
different sites across the nation, and is used as management model for the YESS Program.<p> 
	The <b>Scholarship Program</b> administered by FEC annually awards 
scholarships of $500-$1,000 
each to students with disabilities.  This program has been funded by General Motors Corporation and by private 
donations.<p> 
	<b>Minigrants</b> is a national program which provides funds to schools, community groups, and 
other centers of learning for innovative educational programs.  The Dreyfus Foundation and the Union Carbide 
Corporation, among others, support the program.  Between 20 and 30 grants are awarded annually.<p> 
	The FEC is partnered with the University of New Mexico to act as a <b>Clearing house for Funding 
Sources in Special Education</b>, and to assist predominantly minority colleges and universities.  The FEC 
prepared and published a book which describes foundations and organizations that fund projects for special 
education.  The book is regularly updated.  It was through personal contact with organizations participating in 
the TEAMWORK project and other organizations using the clearinghouse that FEC recognized a pattern of need 
among disabled youth.  The University of New Mexico project is federally supported at the rate of 
approximately $1.3 million dollars per year.<p>
