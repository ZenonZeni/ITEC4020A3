<h1>Transportation</h1>
<p>
<h2>General</h2>
The nation's transportation sector, comprised of approximately 195 
million
vehicles of all types, is 97% dependent on petroleum and consumes 63% of 
all
oil used in the United States. Foreign oil constitutes nearly half 
(49.3%) of
all oil used--and the use of imported oil is growing.<p>

Total energy consumption in transportation is expected to grow from 20.1 
quads
in 1985 to 24.3 quads in 2010.  Efficiency in personal travel is expected 
to
increase by 44%; efficiency of freight transportation is expected to 
increase
by only 11%.<p>

The average fuel efficiency of the U.S. motor vehicle fleet has already
improved 50% since 1973.  But the number of vehicle miles driven has 
increased
45%, offsetting the gains made in efficiency.<p>

In 1990, 86.5% of American workers rode in a car, light truck, or van to 
work.
Single-occupancy vehicles made up 73.2% of the total, and only 5.3% used 
public
transportation. The remainder walked, worked at home, or used a 
motorcycle or
bicycle. <p>
<p>
<h2>Pollution Prevention and Costs</h2>
A reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane can save 6200 gallons of
gasoline and 13,420 pounds of carbon monoxide per day compared to adding 
a lane
in each direction.<p>

Rail uses about 25% the energy per ton-mile of trucks and is expected to 
expand
its share of the market for freight.<p>

Vehicle emissions continue to exacerbate air pollution.  Transportation
accounts for 66% of carbon monoxide emissions, 21% of particulates, 35% 
of
volatile organic compounds,  and 40% of nitrogen oxides--the precursors 
to
ozone and smog.<p>

Along with the irritation it creates, traffic congestion costs U.S. 
communities
at least $43 billion in lost productivity, wasted gasoline, and increased 
air
pollution. This amount of money equates to the annual sales of the 
Chrysler
Corporation in 1993.<p>
<p>
<h2>Economics and Employment</h2>
The transportation sector accounts for almost 15% of the nation's GNP and

almost 15% of its jobs.<p>

In 1992, Americans spent $424 billion on user-operated transportation. 
This
included all costs of owning and operating a vehicle. About 25% of this 
cost
was for gasoline and oil.<p>
<p>
<h2>Market Growth</h2>
Oak Ridge National Laboratory's predicted growth of truck traffic (2.5% 
per
year from 1995 to 2010) is greater than that of light-duty vehicles, 
while the
fuel economy of trucks increases at a slower rate (0.8% per year from 
1995 to
2010) than that of light-duty vehicles.<p>
<p>
<h2>Sustainable Alternatives and Advantages</h2><p>
<b><i>Ethanol:</i></b>  By 2000, 500 million gallons of ethanol made from

biomass will displace 13 million barrels of oil; by 2020, 14 billion
gallons of ethanol will displace 348 million barrels of oil. Ethanol
currently supplies nearly 1% of the nation's transportation fuel needs;
production is based in the Midwest; about 400 million bushels of corn is
converted to more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol annually.<p>

<b><i>U.S. Jobs:</i></b>  The biomass-to-ethanol industry will create 
more than
2800 new jobs by 2000 and more than 100,000 jobs by 2020.<p>

<b><i>Reduce Global Climate Change:</i></b>  Ethanol made from biomass
generates 90% less carbon dioxide (the leading cause of global warming) 
and 70%
less sulfur dioxide (the leading agent responsible for acid rain) than 
does
reformulated gasoline.<p>

<b><i>Ease of Use:</i></b>  Mixing 20% biodiesel with 80% diesel will 
enable
U.S. diesel-fueled fleet operators to comply with stricter emissions
regulations with no major modifications to existing equipment.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
Renewable fuels are a key to achieving sustainable development in the 
United
States; the Department of Energy's (DOE's) biofuels programs will 
stimulate
investment in the nation's agricultural, fuel production, and automobile
manufacturing industries.<p>

By 1996, the federal Clean Cities Program anticipates commitments for 
250,000
alternative fuel vehicles in federal, state, local, and private 
fleets.<p>
