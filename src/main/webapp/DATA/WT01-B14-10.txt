certificates for your fund investment?">
<BR>
Your privileges as a Kemper Funds shareholder are designed to give you
maximum flexibility to adjust your investment portfolio as the general
market conditions or your individual investment objectives change. But
if you have share certificates for your funds, you should know
that your flexibility to move your shares is limited. 

<BR><BR>

The traditional purpose of share certificates - which was to provide
proof of ownership - has been rendered almost obsolete. Today, the
securities industry has the capability to settle trades and maintain
investors' positions electronically. The existence of the paper
documents and your possession of them, though, can keep you from taking
full advantage of your privileges.

<BR><BR>

Some examples: You cannot redeem shares by telephone or wire transfer or
use the telephone exchange privilege if share certificates have been
issued. The systematic exchange and the systematic withdrawal plan are
two privileges that cannot be established for fund accounts whose shares
are held in certificate form. If you want to exchange shares that you
hold in certificate form, you must first return them to Kemper.

<BR><BR>

Considering these limitations and the risks involved if a certificate is
lost or destroyed - a bond worth 2% or more of the certificate value is
normally required to replace the certificate, Kemper strongly recommends
that you not request your shares in certificate form and that you return
any certificates you may have.

<BR><BR>

Please return your certificates <EM>by registered mail</EM> to the
following
address:

<BR><BR>

<DL><DD>
Kemper Service Company
<BR>
Special Functions Department
<BR>
811 Main Street
<BR>
Kansas City, MO 64105
</DL>
<BR><BR>

Please do not endorse your certificates or sign them in any way. Once we
receive them, you will be notified that your certificated shares have been 
deposited in your account.
