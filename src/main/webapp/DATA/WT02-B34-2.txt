Antibody Engineering
Becomes a Service

Oxford Molecular Group (Magdalen Centre, Oxford Science Park,
Sandford-on-Thames, Oxford OX4 4GA, U.K.; Fax: 086/578-4601) is
teaming up with MRC Collaborative Centre (1-3 Burtonhole Lane, Mill
Hill, London NW7 1AD, U.K.; Fax: 081/906-1395) to provide antibody
engineering service on behalf of pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies.

The goal of the partnership is to attract collaborative research
opportunities.  Oxford Molecular offers a computer-based approach
to drug design, and MRC offers laboratory expertise. The aim of the
antibody engineering service is to improve the characteristics of
existing antibodies at a late research stage or early clinical
phase of development. Apparently a need or demand exists for
centralized, multidisciplinary services for antibody design and
modification (engineering).

One aspect of the service will be humanization efforts, to make
mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies more compatible for human
therapeutic use. Numerous developmental efforts of the past were
scuttled when investigators discovered that the human body rejects
foreign proteins (surprise!). Other aspects of the engineering
service will entail improvements of antibody affinity and
specificity for binding to unique antigens often found on the
surface of cells.

Bayer Looks Into
Biocatalytic Synthesis

Enzymes are known for their ability to selectively catalyze
reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. There is a growing
interest in the biocatalytic synthesis of specialty polymers since
such an approach can generate additional properties such as
chirality and biodegradability.  Biologically synthesized polymers
have been applied as absorbents, biodegradable materials, chiral
adsorbents, liquid crystals, and perm-selective membranes.

Bayer Corp. (1 Mellon Bank Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15258; Tel:
412/394-5500, Fax: 412/394-5534) has discovered a process for the
production of polyesters reacting a diol with an acid or acid ester
in the presence of a solid enzymes and supercritical fluids (U.S.
Patent 5,478,910).

Low molecular weight linear aliphatic oligoesters that are hydroxy
terminated have commercial significance for use in the manufacture
of polyurethane resins. The current commercial process is based on
acid/base catalyzed condensation polymerization between a
diacid/diester and a diol. The use of traditional catalysts is
limited because such catalysts tend to have an undesirable effect
on the subsequent polyurethane synthesis.

Supercritical fluids have been described as extraction solvents,
have been used in various industrial extraction processes, and have
been suggested as being useful for a variety of enzyme catalyzed
reactions. With supercritical fluids as the reaction medium, enzyme
enantioselectivity can be manipulated by the pressure of the
system.

In both enzymatic and non-enzyme catalyzed synthesis of oligoesters
and polyesters, it is difficult to control product molecular weight
in a predictable manner. All techniques described to date depend
upon changing the reaction time in order to manipulate molecular
weight. In the case of non-enzyme catalyzed oligo- and polyesters,
the final product typically contains cyclic ester by-products and
small amounts of residual catalyst, both of which can adversely
affect properties of products produced from those oligo- and
polyesters.

The Bayer innovation overcomes most of the above difficulties and
allows for the production of a wide variety of polyesters, where it
is relatively simple to produce a material of a desired molecular
weight by merely varying the pressure under which the
polyesterification or polytransesterification reaction is
conducted.

Affinity Makes
Safer Factor VIII

Hemophiliacs depend on the clotting substance Factor VIII, but the
possibility of AIDS contaminating the blood supply adds to their
burden. Screening blood donors helps. So does testing for AIDS
antibodies, although such tests miss latent virus. Regular Factor
VIII is an extract derived from pooled blood. Making sure that the
blood used is free of the AIDS virus is of concern to all
responsible manufacturers.

Baxter International (Deerfield, Illinois 60015; Tel: 708/948-2000,
Fax: 708/948-2887), one of the leading producers of Factor VIII
worldwide, has developed a process for purifying Factor VIII:C by
employment of a multiple immunoaffinity method.  First, Factor
VIII:C is pulled out of solution with an immobilized antibody that
specifically binds this clotting protein through hydrophobic
attraction. Next, the protein is eluted from the affinity matrix
with a desorbing, nonpolar solvent.

Then, the Factor VIII:C is passed through an affinity region, which
is an ion-exchange region capable of binding the protein while
allowing contaminants to pass through. Finally, the purified factor
is eluted from the affinity material and recovered.  The process is
described in U.S. Patent 5,470,954.

Other approaches to making Factor VIII safer, taken by other
suppliers, include the use of heat or solvent-detergents to
inactivate the virus.  The arrival of recombinant Factor VIII,
which is produced by cell culture rather than by extraction from
blood, circumvents the whole problem of AIDS contamination
altogether. The recombinant protein is more expensive than the
regular product, however, and some medical insurance companies have
balked at the higher cost.

While the cost of treating AIDS would be even greater, should
patients come down with this disease, the risk of contracting AIDS
from regular Factor VIII is very low, the insurers say. The extra-
purified, extracted material now becoming available improves the
situation even further and makes it competitive, in terms of
safety, with the recombinant version. Currently, recombinant
products have about a 20% share of the total Factor VIII market.

Method Purifies
Crude Proteins

David Naveh and John C. Tang of Schering Nederland B.V. (Van
Houten, Industriepark 1, NL-1381 MZ Weesp, The Netherlands; Tel:
0031-2940-62424, Fax: 0031-2940-18336) have invented an
ion-exchange chromatography technique that purifies proteins.  The
crude protein mixture contains one or more undesirable proteins of
unknown isoelectric points.  Naveh and Tang use either computer
simulation or isoelectric focusing gels to determine the
isoelectric points of proteins in the crude protein mixture.

The pH for the ion-exchange chromatography is adjusted to a point
between the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractions
to be separated.  Separation occurs when contact is made between
the ion-exchange resin and the crude protein mixture.  Since the
proteins in the first and second fractions are oppositely charged,
only one of the fractions binds to the ion-exchange resin.  U.S.
Patent 5,451,662, which protects the technique, also discloses
details on the purification of GM-CSF using a cation-exchange
resin.

Incyte Adds J&J
Subscription Database

Incyte Pharmaceuticals (3330 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304;
Tel: 415/855-0555, Fax: 415/855-0572) has signed on  Johnson &
Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ 08903; Tel: 908/524-0400) as the sixth
subscriber to its genetic sequence and gene-expression database,
Lifeseq. Although financial terms were not disclosed, the
arrangment provides for payment of yearly subscription fees and on-
site access fees.

The addition of J&J brings to Incyte a minimum of $100 million from
all of the subscribers so far, which also include Abbott, Hoechst,
Novo Nordisk Pfizer, and Pharmacia & Upjohn. Notes Roy Whitfield,
president and CEO of Incyte, "The recent increase in the number of
Lifeseq subscribers is indicative of the growing realization that
the use of genomic sequence and expression information represents
an essential tool in pharmaceutical and new diagnostic product
development."

Incyte's database contains a wealth of genomic sequence and tissue-
specific expression information, encompassing 800,000 cDNA clones
to date.  The genetic data are obtained from over 800 tissue
samples in its in-house bank, a figure which is expanding. Incyte
believes it has the largest sequencing and bioinformatics operation
in the world, with an ability to screen as many as 4,000 partial
genes each day.

Subscribers to the  database use the genetic information to
identify new therapeutic targets for drug development, identify
human analogs of promising animal molecules, learn more about
particular disease processes, and understand the pharmacological
and toxicological impact of a new drug on human tissues.
Diagnostic applications are other uses of the genetic information.

Tissue-specific cDNA refers to the genes actually turned on, and
turned on uniquely, in the various bodily tissues.  While every
human cell possess the full set of genes (now thought to number
around 70,000), the process of differentiation during embryo
development results in the turning on and turning off of particular
genes in a way that gives each tissue its special characteristics.

Suppressor Proteins
Arrest AIDS Virus

Researchers at the University of Maryland have identified a new
family of proteins that may slow the progression of AIDS in people
who have been infected with the virus for a period of time but who
have not become sick.

At the University of Maryland, where Robert Gallo led the research
effort, scientists identified three closely related suppressor
proteins and isolated them from human immune cells.  When mixed in
a test tube with the AIDS virus, the three proteins worked in
concert to stop the virus from multiplying.  The proteins have the
names rantes, mip1-alpha, and mip1-beta.

At another research institute, Germany's Paul Ehrlich Institute
(Langen, Germany), scientists discovered a fourth suppressor
protein. It appears to be unrelated to the other three.  This
protein is equated with a previously known substance, interleukin-
16.

In test tubes, the proteins prevent the AIDS virus from
reproducing.  Scientists say they believe that patients with slowly
progressing AIDS may have higher levels of these HIV suppressors in
their bloodstreams than patients who get sick relatively quickly.

The discoveries are likely to increase research competition for new
treatments that can be based on these suppressor proteins.  Anthony
Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, believes that the discoveries open new avenues of drug
research. But the research teams themselves say they do not yet
know how the suppressor proteins work, nor have they been able to
prove that the proteins delay the onset of full-blown AIDS in some
patients.

These recent discoveries come from nearly 10 years of research in
which scientists have noticed that human immune system cells,
called CD-8+,  apparently elaborate proteins that seem to stop the
AIDS virus from replicating.  At the earlier time, they were not
able to identify the molecular structure of the proteins.

The Gallo team at Maryland has been making progress toward
understanding how the suppressor proteins might work and expects to
begin animal tests that can determine whether therapies based on
the newly discovered suppressor proteins are possible.

Vaccine for Peptic
Ulcer Is on the Way

The joint venture between OraVax (Cambridge, MA; Tel: 617/494-1339)
and Pasteur-Merieux-Connaught announced the successful completion
of a Phase I clinical trial with their UreAB vaccine antigen
against Helicobacter pylori, the causative bacterial infection
underlying most cases of peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis.

In the U.S. alone, this infection affects 20% of the population
between ages 20 and 30 and more than 50% of the population below
age 60.  The infection causes the large fraction of the more than
5 million cases of peptic ulcers seen each year in the U.S. In
Japan, where the problem is even worse, the infection rate exceeds
80%.

Peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis currently are treated by two
principal classes of drugs that prevent gastric acid secretion, H2
receptor blockers and ATPase/proton pump inhibitors. H2 receptor
blockers include SmithKline Beecham's cimetidine (Tagamet), Merck's
famotidine (Pepcid), Lilly's nizatidine (Axid), and Glaxo's
ranitidine (Zantac) and have combined worldwide annual sales
totaling about $6 billion.

ATPase/proton pump inhibitors include the omeprazole sold by Merck
(Prilosec), Astra (Losec), and Takeda's lansoprazole (Takepron) and
have combined worldwide annual sales of about $1.5 billion.  Having
substantially  fewer sales are prostaglandin mimics, such as
Searle's Cytotec. The market additionally includes such OTC
products as Tums and Maalox.

If peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis can be prevented with a
vaccine, doing so will probably cut deeply into the sales of all
these different products -- good for the national healthcare bill
but bad for the suppliers of treatment drugs.

Anti-Staph Antibody
Production Expanded

North American Biologicals Inc. (Boca Raton, FL 33431-0701; Tel:
407/989-5800, Fax: 407/989-5801) has expanded its donor stimulation
program for StaphGAM, a product intended to prevent Staphylococcus
aureus  infections in hospitalized patients. In the United States,
approximately 3 million people run the risk of developing Staph
infections in hospitals.

The data gathered in this study will be used to assist NABI in
producing clinical trial quantities of StaphGAM, which is expected
to begin human Phase I trials in late 1996.

The company has presented preclinical data that indicated that
StaphGAM reduced the occurrence in animal models of S. aureus
endocarditis, an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, by
up to 80%. According to company officials, in several animal
challenge models StaphGAM also significantly reduced the number of
Staph bacteria surviving in the blood, livers, and kidneys after
experimental infection.

The donor stimulation program currently under way is intended to
maximize antibody production in donors by evaluating the impact of
different dosing regimes and differing antibody collection
schedules. Once NABI has determined that StaphGAM is stimulating
the optimum levels of Staph-fighting antibodies in donors, the
company plans to expand the number of donors being immunized and
begin producing trial quantities of StaphGAM in mid-1996.

NABI's donor stimulation program for StaphGAM, which was initiated
in September 1995, comprises 70 healthy adults who are vaccinated
with StaphVAX, the staph vaccine that NABI has licensed from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), to stimulate the production of
high levels of antibodies against staph in plasma donors.

These antibodies are then purified and formulated into a specific
polyclonal antibody product, called StaphGAM.  StaphGAM may provide
immediate protection to patients who are at risk of contracting
hospital-related staph infections.  These individuals include
severe trauma patients and those undergoing cardiac vascular graft
and joint-replacement surgery.

Shering Plough
Acquires Canji

Schering-Plough (1 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940-1000; Tel:

Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/597-0177), a privately-
held biotechnology company, in a stock deal worth $54.5 million. S-
P had previously held a minority equity stake in the firm.  Canji
specializes in gene therapy, especially basing its efforts on the
p53 tumor-suppressor gene that has a key role in regulating the
cell-growth cycle and apoptosis.

Says Richard Kogan, president of S-P, "Just as DNAX is pioneering
discoveries in biotechnology and immunology, so do we expect Canji
to become S-P's center for gene-therapy research." Blake Ingle,
Canji's president, also sees benefits in the acquisition, saying
"Joining with S-P will allow the Canji organization to focus
exclusively on the exciting science at hand."

Isis Throws Out
Antisense Molecule

Isis Pharmaceuticals (2292 Faraday Ave., Carlsbad, CA 92007; Tel:
619/931-9200, Fax: 619/931-9639) has decided not to continue
further development of its antisense compound 2105 (afovirsen),
intended for the treatment of genital warts. The substance is an
antiviral that prevents the expression of a protein essential for
the replication of human papilloma virus, the cause of the warts.

A recently completed Phase II study was designed to ascertain trend
information regarding the effectiveness of multiple doses of the
substance in conjunction with cryosurgery, which is a treatment
currently employed.

The data showed that a trend in favor of three-times-a-week dosing
over two times a week, but the trend was not sufficient to justify
further expense to continue the drug's development. In making this
decision, Isis considered the market potential and saw an
insufficient possible reward in light of the financial requirements
and technical risks that would be involved in creating and testing
a sustained-release formulation.

Stem-Cell Therapy
Shows Promise

Somatix Therapy (850 Marina Village Pkwy., Alameda, CA 94501-1034;
Tel: 510/748-3000, Fax: 510/769-8533) has tested a stem-cell gene
therapy in a Phase I human clinical trial against chronic
graulomatous disease and found encouraging results. The disease is
a rare, inherited disorder in which granulocytes (the major type of
white blood cells) fail to produce oxidizing agents needed to kill
bacteria and fungi.  In about one-third of patients, the disease
arises from a defect in the p47phox gene, resulting in an inability
to produce a protein subunit of the enzyme that generates the
microbe-killing oxidants.

The clinical trial, a collaboration of Somatix, Baxter Healthcare's
Immunotherapy Division, and the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, took patients' blood and isolated the stem
cells, which then were genetically modified and returned to the
patients on an individual basis.  Retroviral vectors were used for
the genetic engineering.

Progenics Licenses
Melanoma Vaccine

Progenics Pharmaceuticals (Old Saw Mill River Road, Tarrytown, NY
10591; Tel: 914/789-2800) has licensed a therapeutical vaccine for
melanoma from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New
York).  Called GMK, the vaccine consists of a ganglioside
conjugate, one of a new class being developed by the company.

Gangliosides are complexes of carbohydrates and lipids found on the
surface of cells.  In particular, GM2 ganglioside is present in
approximately 95% of melanoma cells.  The company has conjugated
this ganglioside to the hemocyanin of the keyhole limpet, which
serves as a protein carrier of the substance.

In clinical trials, patients vaccinated with this conjugate, called
GMK, developed anti-GM2 antibodies that were capable of
specifically killing melanoma cells. Melanoma is the most deadly
type of skin cancer and is growing at the fastest rate of any
cancer in the industrialized world.  In the U.S. alone, about
37,000 new melanoma cases were reported in 1994, and by 2000 it is

Two large Phase III clinical trials of Progenics' GMK vaccine are

Alpha Interferon
Ok'd for Melanoma

Schering-Plough (1 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940-1000; Tel:
201/822-7000, Fax: 201/822-7048) obtained FDA approval of its
Intron brand of interferon-a2b for use as an adjuvant ot surgery in
the treatment of malignant melanoma. The drug is intended to curb
relapses of the cancer.

A recent clinical study showed that the alpha-interferon increased
the median overall survival of patients by more than 12 months and
the median relapse-free survival by nine months. The five-year
survival rate was improved by 24%, and the five-year relapse-free
rate by 42%. Fatigue and flu-like symptoms were the predominant
side effects.

Alpha-interferon has numerous approved medical indications already
(as well as several unofficial ones), and the new development
extends the approved applications.  According to market-research
firm BCC Inc. (25 Van Zant St., Norwalk, CT 06855; Tel: 203/853-
4266), alpha-interferon had total worldwide sales of $1.35 billion
in 1994, of which cancer applications accounted for two-thirds and
infectious disease applications for one-third. Total sales for
cancer application were projected to grow at 4.9% annually through
2000, while infection uses were projected to grow at only 1.0%.

Urogenital Factor
Inhibits Prostate Cancer

Scientists at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) have
identified and sequenced the gene for ps20, a protein able to
inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells in test tube.
Protein ps20  activates urogenital growth inhibitory factor UGIF),
the actual protein that mediates the proliferation and
differentation of prostate cancer cells. The research on ps20 is
being done by David Rowley, in the Department of Cell Biology, who
has now produced a recombinant version.

Rowley previously isolated UGIF from cells of the rat fetal
urogenital sinus organ. This substance was shown to inhibit DNA
synthesis and cell proliferation of human prostatic carcinoma
cells.  The researchers speculate that a reduction in UGIF leads to
poorly differentiated cells associated with the progression of
prostatic carcinomas, while an adequate presence of UGIF promotes
differentiation and thereby inhibits growth. If UGIF activity can
be enhanced (for example, through the action of ps20), then the
typical progression of cancer cells may be inhibited. A U.S. patent
has been issued on the use of UGIF for the treatment of prostate
cancer.

Sheffield Medical Technologies (1111 Bagby, Houston, TX 77002; Tel:
713/739-8221, Fax: 713/739-1131) holds an option to exclusively
license both the ps20 and the UGIF technology.

Angiogenesis Blockers
Arrest Metastasis

Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ 08543-4000; Tel: 609/252-4000,
Fax: 609/252-3885) thinks EntreMed (Rockville, MD; Tel. 301/217-

company's antiangiogenesis compounds that, in preclinical studies,
prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels and thereby block
the growth of primary and metastatic cancers. The deal encompasses
thalidomide, thalidomide analogs, and Angiostatin protein.

Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, who observed
that cancerous tissues are fed by newly grown blood vessels
sprouting from existing arteries.  These blood vessels constitute
a "nutritional highway" feeding the growth of tumors.  Entremed, a
privately held firm headed by Leon Rosenberg, licensed
antiangiogenic technologies developed by Folkman. Bristol-Myers
Squibb is a world leader in anticancer drugs.

Researchers Harness
Hematopoietic Stem Cells

The progenitor stems cells of the bone marrow that give rise to all
the various blood cells are being used in several ways for the
treatment of cancer and cancer-related therapy. Physicians want to
use high-dose chemical or radiation treatment, but the untoward
side effect is a destruction of bone-marrow cells and consequently
a severe depletion in the number of infection-fighting white blood
cells and clot-promoting platelets. To find any use of the better
cancer-fighting effect of high-dose treatment, this problem has to
be surmounted.

Cell Genesys (344 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404; Tel:
415/358-9600, Fax: 415/358-0803) seeks to use stem cells for cancer
gene therapy. Cell Genesis genetically engineered the stem cells so
that they recognize a specific protein on the surface of tumor
cells, then transplanted them into mice.  Over 80% of the mice
receiving a lethal injection of malignant tumor cells survived at
least 17 weeks and showed no evidence of residual tumor when tested
by a highly sensitive PCR assay for tumor-specific DNA.

Increasing the number of stem cells as an adjunct to high-dose
cancer treatment helps patients resist the sometimes fatal
infections that may develop as a serious side effect.  The stem
cells can be increased either in the body or outside it.

Aastrom Biosciences (24 Frank Wright Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48106;
Tel: 313/930-5555), a collaborator of RPR Gencell, takes the
approach of increasing stem cells outside the body.  In a clinical
trial at the University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the
feasibility and safety of an ex vivo method of stem-cell production
was demonstrated as an adjunct to autologous bone-marrow
transplantation, itself given as an adjunct to cancer therapy.
Stem cells from 10 breast-cancer patients were collected,
individually cultivated in the company's automated cell-production
system, then returned to the patients.

Taking a similar approach is Systemix (3155 Porter Drive, Palo
Alto, CA 94304; Tel: 415/856-4901).  The difference is that the
company isolates a specific variant of stem cells, the
CD34+Thy+Lin- type. A Phase I/II clinical test with multiple
myeloma patients showed that the infusion of these cells appeared
to help the patients.

Stem cells, and their progeny, can also be mobilized within the
body.  That's the way Immunex (51 University St., Seattle,
Washington 98101; Tel: 206/587-0430, Fax: 206/587-0606) sees it.
The company has just obtained FDA approval to use its Leukine brand
of GM-CSF (generically called sargramostim) as a growth factor to
stimulate peripheral blood progenitor cells and for use after
transplantation of such cells. The drug is administered to patients
before collecting peripheral blood and isolating the progenitor
cells by apheresis.  The procedure cuts down the number of
apheresis runs that must be carried out.  Peripheral progenitor
cells are reinfused into patients after their high-dose cancer
therapy.

Rivals to Immunex and competing against each another, Amgen (1840
DeHavilland Drive, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1789; Tel: 805/447-1000)
and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426;
Tel: 610/454-8000, Fax: 610/454-3813) use a different growth
factor, G-CSF, on peripheral blood cells. Amgen's product, Neupogen
(generically known as filgrastim) has obtained approval for this
application, the fourth indication of the drug. RPR, still in
clinical trials, says its version of G-CSF, generically called
lenograstim, may be more potent than Amgen's product.

Amgen points out that in the U.S. alone, about 17,000 cell
transplants were performed in 1994, of which 9,000 were peripheral
blood progenitor-cell transplants, representing a 30%-35% increase
in the number of such procedures over the previous year.  This
increase results from both an increase in the number of patients
eligible for treatment and a 50% conversion from bone-marrow
transplants.

The latter are not only more invasive and therefore more risky than
peripheral blood transplants, but also more costly in dollar terms.
The main cost advantage with peripheral blood-transplantation
methods is that patients can recover outside the hospital after the
blood cells have been collected.  Also, hospital stays after the
transplantation are shorter, which saves money as well.

Another Gene Defect
in Breast Cancer

An international team of scientists, which includes a research
group at Duke Medical Center (Durham, NC) led by P. Andrew Futreal
and the Institute of Cancer Research (Surrey, U.K.) led by Dr.
Michael Stratton, has identified a second major breast-cancer gene
that makes some women highly likely to get the disease.  Thirty-
eight others from six countries were involved in the research
effort.

The gene is called BRCA2, and it follows the identification of
BRCA1 last year.  Together, the genes account for about 90% of
breast cancers from inherited susceptibility, with BRCA2
responsible for about 40%. It has earlier been announced that
scientists had narrowed the search for BRCA2 to a small area of
chromosome 13.

In a related development, scientists at Myriad Genetics Inc. (Salt
Lake City, UT) announced that they had recovered the entire BRCA2
gene.  The company says it plans to use it in combination with
BRCA1 to develop a test for predisposition to hereditary breast
cancer.

Only about 5-10% of breast cancer cases are now thought to come
from inheriting a faulty gene.  The cause of the vast majority of
cases of breast cancer is not known, although scientists are
investigating possible hormonal and other triggers.

Like BRCA1, the new-found gene seems to suppress cancer when it is
working normally.  But when BRCA2 is defective, this brake is lost.
In the short term, location of the second gene should lead to more
tests to help families with high rates of breast cancer  learn
which members are affected.

Centacor's Results
Spell Good News

Centocor (200 Great Valley Pkwy., Malvern, PA 19355-1307; Tel:
610/651-6000) called an early halt of its clinical study of ReoPro
because the drug has proven so effective in treating patients with
unstable angina. The study was scheduled to run until late 1996 or
early 1997, but early results showed that patients who were given
ReoPro intravenously had a nearly 70% reduction in deaths.

Angina is a disorder in which narrowing of arteries diminishes
blood supply to the heart. The clinical trial that was halted
involved patients who were given coronary angioplasty to open the
clot-clogged arteries. ReoPro prevents platelet cells in the blood
from sticking together and initiating clot formation in arteries,
which in this instance helps prevent the artery from re-closing due
to a new formation of blood clots.

ReoPro costs $1,350 per treatment, but Centocor's earlier studies
found that it saves $3,000 per patient in overall medical care
costs by preventing complications.  Patients receive one course of
treatment per angioplasty.

In 1995, ReoPro produced revenues of about $22 million (the product
is licensed to Eli Lilly, who pays Centocor a percentage in royalty
income)  This year it is estimated that the revenues should jump to
$100 million, and by the year 2000, it is estimated that  revenues
could be $782 million.  As a result of the anticipated revenue
stream, Centocor, after a decade of losses, could report positive
earnings this year.  Profitability could come as soon as the third
quarter of this year.

Yet Another
Interleukin

The "lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF)" first described in
1982 by Boston University's David Center, William Cruikshank, and
Hardy Kornfeld, has been identifed now as interleukin-16. The
cytokine stimulates the growth of CD4+ T cells, the very ones
infected by HIV/AIDS. Besides binding to the CD4 receptor and
stimulating T-cell growth, IL-16 also stimulates the migration of
lymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes.  Expression of IL-16 is
thought to be an early response to histamine, a messenger hormone
of the immune system.

The scientists have characterized the gene that codes for IL-16 and
have produced a recombinant product in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic expression systems. Not only might IL-16 itself have
potential use as an AIDS-fighting material; antagonists to IL-16
could also relieve the bronchial constriction characteristic of
asthma or could treat T-cell lymphoma by blocking IL-16's binding
to the CD4 receptor.  Licensing of the IL-16 and its technology is
being handled through Research Corp. Technologies (101 N. Wilmot
Road, Tucson, AZ 85711-3335; Tel: 520/748-4400, Fax: 520/748-0025).

Imaging Antibodies
Make Progress

On Oct. 17, 1995, an FDA advisory-panel meeting deferred a decision
regarding the approval of CEA-Scan, from Immunomedics Inc. (300
American Road, Morris Plains, NJ 07950; Tel: 201/605-8200, Fax:
201/605-8282), to another FDA panel comprised of specialists in
diagnostic imaging and oncology. Immunomedics now responds by
finalizing its presentation to this new panel.  It believes it has
made progress toward agreements on all issues raised by the FDA.

CEA-Scan is in the final stages of regulatory review in the U.S.
and Europe.  The company is also planning to commence clinical
trials and to seek regulatory approval of this product in Japan. In
contrast to other countries, Japan requires that the pivotal
clinical trials be conducted in Japan.  Therefore, the company
cannot submit its final clinical data from U.S. studies.

CEA-Scan should be able to image cancers other than colorectal,
such as esophagal, medullary thyroid, breast, lung, stomach, bile
duct, pancreatic, ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers. Together
these comprise more than 600,000 new cancer cases in the U.S. on an
annual basis.  The two most prevalent are lung and breast cancers,
and it is for that reason that Immunomedics is pursuing additional
uses of CEA-Scan by undertaking pivotal trials in these cancer
types. The lung-cancer pivotal trial is going on, and the protocol
for the breast-cancer trial is being designed for submission to the
FDA.

Since there are other new methods being developed to better assess
the malignancy or spread of a tumor found on mammography, the
company has taken more time than originally planned to study the
potential of CEA-Scan in this disease. The company already knows
from its Phase II clinical results that CEA-Scan can be
complimentary to mammography for diagnosing a breast tumor.
Further, it can reveal involvement of the axilla, which is
prognostically important when doing a presurgical evaluation.

A single injection of CEA-Scan can also reveal spread of cancer to
other parts of the body, which otherwise requires a battery of
imaging tests, such as CAT scans, bone scans, and the like.

The company believes there are opportunities for the use of CEA-
Scan in breast cancer, which affects approximately one in nine
women in the U.S. with an annual mortality of about 46,000.  Phase
III trials must be performed before Immunomedics can be sure of the
efficacy of CEA-Scan for breast-cancer detection.

Other Immunomedics products are progressing well in regulatory
reviews around the world.  LeukoScan, for imaging and diagnosing
sites of infection and inflammation, is progressing well in
regulatory review in Europe, where it was filed in August 1995 for
the detection of sites of infection in the extremities,
particularly osteomyelitis. The company anticipates an inspection
of its manufacturing facilities by the European regulatory
representatives during January of this year. Because of all of this
regulatory activity for CEA-Scan in the U.S. and Europe, and for
LeukoScan in Europe, the company has delayed the filing of
LeukoScan in the U.S.

The pivotal trial for the appendicitis indication for LeukoScan has
been progressing well, and the company is already halfway through
the planned patient accrual.  Patient enrollment for the prosthetic
joint infection or inflammation protocol has been much slower than
originally projected.

Other uses of LeukoScan are being considered for additional trials.
Therefore, at least one other application for this product will
begin clinical studies during 1996.

Other Immunomedics imaging products, LymphoScan and AFP-Scan, are
progressing well in clinical trials.  As Orphan Drug products,
these have a more limited clinical application and have therefore
been moving slower through clinical trials.

With substantial input from the FDA and the oncological community,
a Phase III pivotal trial protocol for LymphoScan, as an imaging
agent for staging non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, is still being designed
by the company.

Because of the rarity of the diseases in the U.S. for which the
company's AFP-Scan is designed -- for diagnosing cancers of the
testes, ovary, and liver -- it has been necessary for the company
to seek clinical testing sites abroad.

More Intense
Attack on Fat

Everybody likes to eat, but most people don't want to pay the
penalty of gaining weight. "If it tastes good, it must be
fattening" seems to be the common plaint. Without self-control and
making changes in food choices, individuals may turn to diet aids,
such as amphetamine-based appetite suppressants.   Researchers are
now taking a new approach, based on a growing understanding of how
the body regulates fat storage and the sensation of satiety -- the
feeling that you've eaten enough. The research offers new targets
for drug development in this field.

The finding by Jeffrey Friedman, Rockefeller University, of an OB
("obesity) gene, its licensing to Amgen (1840 De Havilland Drive,
Thousand Oaks, CA 91320; Tel: 805/447-2303), and its recombinant
expression by scientists at Hoffmann-La Roche (340 Kingsland St.,
Nutley, NJ 07110-1199; Tel: 201/562-2232) were reported in AGN
(August).

The protein specified by the OB gene is called leptin, a peptide
hormone that, when injected into a mouse brain, results in reduced
food intake and a reduction in body weight among specially made,
obese mice. Leptin (fron the Greek, meaning "thin") appears to act
on neural pathways that control eating, energy metabolism, and body
weight. As fat builds up, fat cells release leptin to curb the
appetite and make the body use up excess fat.

The news continues with two further developments. Millenium
Pharmaceuticals (640 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02139-4815; Tel:
617/374-9480) has identified, cloned, and isolated the brain's
receptor for leptin, called OB-R. This gene in mice sits on a part
of chromosome 4 known to contain the so-called "db" gene, which
also plays a role in obesity, although it is not yet firmly proven
that  the OB-R gene and the db gene are one and the same.

The finding of the leptin receptor is significant. Although leptin
may have a future as a weight-controlling drug (and Amgen certainly
thinks so),  initial human studies last year have shown that most
obese persons are not deficient in leptin but, in fact, have
elevated levels of this fat-suppressive hormone. The fault may lie
instead with a receptor unresponsive to leptin. This seems to be
the case in db-obese mice.

Besides the OB-R leptin receptor, Millenium is on the trail of
others leads relating to the genetic basis for obesity.  Last year,
its scientists found another obesity-connected gene in mice, called
the "tub" gene. The company's research on obesity (and on diabetes)
is being financially supported by Hoffmann-La Roche.

Even more recently, Stephen Bloom at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School of Hammersmith Hospital (London, U.K.) reports new
information about an intestinal protein called glucogen-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1).  After a meal, the intestines secrete GLP-1,
which then signals the pancreas to start producing insulin.
Insulin is the hormone that prompts body cells to take in dietary
glucose from the bloodstream and start using it. Bloom now finds
that GLP-1 also tells the brain that enough food has been consumed,
in other words, gives the sensation of satiety.   Thus, the GLP-1
is a natural appetite suppressant.

It now seems clear that the biological regulation of appetite, body
mass, and metabolism is complex and interrelated.  Undoubtedly,
more targets for potential therapeutic intervention will be
revealed in the future.  What, for instance, comprises the body's
threshhold for sensing "excessive" fat?  What drives the
individual, mechanistically and biochemically, to seek out food?
Why (and how) do certain foods appeal and others do not?  Can the
body's channeling of metabolism toward muscle or fat distribution
be influenced? Until more answers come in and the new drugs arrive,
it looks like we'll just have to continue our efforts to resist
that second helping.

Year that Was:
The1995 Results

Companies are reporting their 1995 financial results, and so far,
the performances don't look great. Biotechnology companies are
starting to show some product sales revenues, but they plow so much
back into research that they wind up with a net loss.

    Alamar Biosciences (Chicago, IL; Tel: 312/642-9200) reports
total income of $0.5 million for the year ended Sept. 30, but a net
loss of $3.8 million.
    Celltech Ltd. (216 Bath Road, Slough SL1 4EN, Berkshire, U.K.;
Fax: 44/753-36632) reports total sales of $27.0 million for the
year ended Sept. 30, but a net loss of $8.5 million
    Creative Biomolecules (35 South St., Hopkinton, MA 01748; Tel:
508/435-9001, Fax: 508/435-0992) reports total revenues of $13.2
million for the year ended Sept. 30, but a net loss of $7.6 million
    Oncogene Science (106 Charles Lindbergh Blvd., Uniondale, NY
11553; Tel: 516/222-0023) reports total revenues of $9.7 million
for the year ended Sept. 30, but a net lost of $4.3 million.
    Lidak Pharmaceuticals (11077 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla,
CA 92017;  Tel: 619/558-0364) reports revenues of $0.88 million for
the year ended Sept. 30, but a net loss of $10.2 million.

What's Ahead
for 1996?

Seeing into the future can be a bit tricky.  We're reminded of the
Coney Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journey
over water.  The next day it rained and in the course of our
perigrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.

Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events is
something like that Coney Island experience: If they're general
enough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying some
biotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while others
will probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trials
will pass, while others will fail.

Ah, but which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, one
could make a fortune.  Some people, of course, believe that test-
tube experiments and preclinical studies with animal models can
foretell the future -- how the candidate drugs will behave in
humans. And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.  One of the
big events of the year just past is the recognition that some
biotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some will
succeed. We may not know precisely which category any particular
venture may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failure
may occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, heady
days of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected
"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place to
let them cope with uncertainty and survive.

Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can be
wishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if  it
receives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumed
percentage share of its available market, then a reasonable
forecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturing
capacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The
"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) in
making business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.

Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past and
present, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,
predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier by
considering several discernible trends.

Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.  Big
pharma surrounds itself with drug-discovery firms to fulfill its
research needs, while biotechnology companies surround themselves
with contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and less committal than
hiring in these functions. Marketing may become the next function
to be outsourced.

Differentation of the biotechnology industry will become more
transparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercialize
biomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical molecules
acting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers of
candidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers of
actual drug candidates.

The struggle to survive will become more intense. It getting harder
to raise money to sustain research in view of coming cuts in the
federal budget. Biotechnology companies will increasingly be judged
on their ability to actually deliver products for sale.

M&A Picks Up
in Health Care

According to investment firm Hambrechst & Quist (1 Bush St., San
Francisco, CA 94104; tel. 415/576-3300), merger and acquisition
activity in health care services will continue to accelerate in
1996, particularly among home care, physician practice management
and HMOs. "Health care reform has driven the health services
industry toward consolidation," James Streator, managing director
of Hambrecht & Quist's health services group, observes. "Many of
the markets targeted by service companies are either fragmented or
undergoing significant consolidation."

In 1995, 82 mergers and acquisitions took place among health care
services companies, representin galmost $14 billion in transaction
value.  These figures compare with 69 such deals worth $20.7
billion in 1994 and 61 deals valued at $16.5 billion in 1993.
Streator adds that "Continued focus on cost containment and quality
standards will characterize health care services in 1996."

Financing activity is also anticipated to increase in 1996,
particularly in information services and physician management. In
1995, 41 equity offerings were made in the health services sector,
both initial and follow-on, raising a total of $3.5 billion. This
compares with 39 offerings in 1994 for $1.8 billion and 33
offerings in 1993 for $1.4 billion.

AGN notes that consolidation in the health services sector
translates into fewer but more powerful customers for products that
the biotechnology industry, pharmaceutical industry and medical
device industry have for sale.

Biogen's b-IFN
Closer to Market

Biogen Inc. (14 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142; Tel:
617/679-2000, Fax: 617/679-2617) announced that a Central Nervous
System Advisory Committee convened by the FDA has recommended that
the FDA approve Biogen's Avonex interferon-beta-la, for treatment
of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Biogen officials believe Avonex represents a major improvement in
the treatment of MS because it is the first and only drug to show,
in a blinded clinical trial, that it slows the progression of
disability and reduces the frequency of exacerbations. The FDA
Advisory Committee recommendation was based on data from a Phase
III clinical trial, in which 40% fewer patients on Avonex
progressed one or more units on the Expanded Disability Status
Scale (EDSS) than patents on placebo. The EDSS is the standard
measure of disease progression in MS.

In addition, patients receiving Avonex in the trial experienced 32%
fewer exacerbations of the disease than patients on placebo.
Further studies, using gadolium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI), showed a statistically significant reduction in the number
and volume of active lesions in treated patients compared to
placebo patients.

Side effects seen in the trial were modest and largely involved
flu-like symptoms characteristic of all interferon drugs.  There
were minimal injection-site reactions.

Biogen, based on the findings of the Advisory Committee, is
optimistic that it will be proceeding to commercialization soon
after the final inspection of its manufacturing facilities by the
FDA.

Human Genome CRADA

Perkin-Elmer's (761 Main Ave., Norwalk, CT  06859;  Tel: 203/762-
1000,  Fax: 203/762-6000) Applied Biosystems Division today
announced the formation of a Cooperative Research And Development
Agreement (CRADA) with the National Center for Human Genome
Research (NCHGR) to  increase the speed of large-scale genotyping
to identify complex  human genetic diseases.

Under the terms of the CRADA, Perkin-Elmer will supply the NCHGR
with Applied Biosystems Genetic Analysis Systems to enhance NCHGR's
current gene-discovery effort aimed at finding the genetic
component  of late-onset diabetes and prostate cancer.  NCHGR
scientists will  serve as a source of information for the creation
of novel products  for all phases of the gene-discovery process and
act as an early test site for those products under development at
Perkin-Elmer.

Genotyping is the process of analyzing the genetic make-up of
families or populations to isolate a disease-causing gene common to
those in the group.  Using automated DNA sequencing and genetic
data-analysis systems developed by Perkin-Elmer's Applied
Biosystems Division, researchers have discovered the origins of
juvenile  diabetes, Duschenne muscular dystrophy, colon cancer, a
form of  breast cancer, and many other debilitating and deadly
diseases.

Perkin-Elmer is the leading global supplier of analytical and
bioresearch systems for research, analysis, quality assurance, and
related applications.  These instrument systems have wide
application in markets such as pharmaceuticals, environmental,
genetic analysis,  chemicals, food, and agriculture.  The company
has revenues of $1 billion and employs 5,800 people worldwide.

Allegro Biologics
Goes to Apotex

Having lost financial support from Eli Lilly with regard to its
CD11b monoclonal antibodies, and having sold off its immune
modulation business to Genetics Insitute (AGN, October), Repligen
(1 Kendall Square, Bldg. 700, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/225-
6000) now has sold off its Allegro Biologics operation to Apotex
USA (New York, NY).

The latter is the U.S. subsidiary of the largest Canadian-owned
pharmaceutical company. Allegro Biologics provides contract
services to the biopharmaceutical industry and has both process-
development laboratories and cGMP manufacturing facilities. Besides
acquiring Allegro, Apotex will also take over Repligen's protein A
and diagnostic reagents business.

That leaves Repligen with its recombinant platelet factor-4.  In a
recent clinical trial, this protein safely and effectively reversed
the anticoagulant effects of heparin in patients undergoing
diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Repligen hopes the rPF-4
ultimately will serve as an alternative to protamine, which
currently has use for reversing heparin's effects.  Protamine now
is used to neutralize heparin after all 500,000 open heart
surgeries done annually in the U.S. and in a portion of the U.S.'s
900,000 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations.

Heparin itself is an inhibitor of the clot-promoting enzyme,
thrombin.  While it is needed to keep blood flowing during
cardiosurgical procedures, the problem with heparin is that it may
cause capillary bleeding after close-up if it remains active. While
neutralizers of heparin are in demand, it is important to note that
better forms of, or safer alternatives to, heparin  are either
becoming available or are in development.

Rhone Picks Up
Enzon's Antibodies

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426; Tel:
610/454-8000, Fax: 610/454-3813) has obtained a worldwide but
nonexclusive license to single-chain antibody technology from Enzon
(40 Kingsbridge Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854-3998; Tel: 908/980-
4500), which itself inherited the technology from Genex when it had
to retrench. RPR will use the technology for the intracellular
expression of SCA proteins and for targeted vectors in the fields
of cell and gene therapy. RPR Gencell plans to apply the technology
to its gene-therapy programs in cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
and immunology.

Enzon receives $1 million from RPR for the deal, plus additional
payments on achieving specified product-development milestones. The
deal also includes royalty payments based on future sales of
products incorporating the single-chain antibody technology.

Single-chain antibodies provide the binding capability of
antibodies but leaves off the Fc fragment so that the proteins can
more easily penetrate tissues and will be less allergenic. The
delivery and intracellular expression of genes coding for SCA
proteins may have particular value for the selective inhibition of
intracellular functions associated with disease conditions.
Additionally, SCAs may allow for a selective targeting of cells for
transfection or transduction with viral and nonviral vectors.

Seragen Forms
Canadian Unit

Seragen Inc. (97 South St., Hopkinton, MA 01748; Tel: 508/435-2331)
formed Seragen Biopharmaceuticals Ltd., a privately held Canadian
operating company to be located in Montreal.

In the private financing, the new company raised C$13.5 million
from a group of six Canadian investors.  Included in the investor
group are Sofinov, a subsidiary of Caisse de Depot et placement du
Quebec, Societe Innovatech du Grand Montreal, MDS Health Ventures,
Health Care and Biotechnology Fund, Canadian Medical Discoveries
Fund, and Royal Bank Capital Corp.

The Canadian investors will own 51% of the new company and will be
granted warrants to purchase 519,033 shares of Seragen Inc. common
stock at US$8.79 per share.  Seragen Inc., with its contribution of
the technology and prior laboratory and clinical development, will
own 49% of the new company.

Seragen Biopharmaceuticals will conduct research and development
and clinical trials of Seragen's proprietary fusion toxin products
in Canada.  The new company will also market and receive royalties
from sales of Seragen products in Canada for the applications
Seragen has retained under its prior agreements with Eli Lilly,
Seragen's partner for the development of fusion toxins having
cancer applications.

The Canadian affiliate will bear a portion of the costs of
Seragen's clinical trials for HIV and psoriasis, thereby relieving
Seragen of up to C$5.3 million of costs, which Seragen would
otherwise have incurred. Seragen Biopharmaceuticals could also
receive significant tax rebates on qualifying R&D -- on the order
of $2 million to $3 million over the next several years.

Initial plans call for expanding to several Canadian sites the
Phase III clinical trials regarding an application to cutaneous T-
cell lymphoma. The IND application was recently approved by
Canada's Health Protection Branch, and one Canadian site in Toronto
has already been initiated.

The company also plans to conduct a Phase II trial involving an HIV
application  and possibly part of a Phase III trial in a psoriasis
application.

Seragen's fusion toxins link the diphtheria toxin to a hormone or
growth factor that targets  a specific receptor on the surface of
disease-causing cells.  The diphtheria toxin is one of the most
potent poisons in nature, possessing cytotoxic activity that
enables it to destroy targeted cells by shutting down protein
biosynthesis, in this case being harnessing to destroy diseased
cells. In its natural state, the diphtheria toxin rides along on a
"universal" targeting material, but in Seragen's products the toxin
is made to selectively destroy only the specifically targeted
cells.

Cadus Pursues
Signal Transduction

Cadus Pharmaceutical Corp. (777 Old Saw Mill River Road, Tarrytown,
NY 10591-64705; Tel: 914/345-3344, Fax: 914/345-3565) formed in
1992 to discover drugs for inflammation and immunological
disorders, but its collaborations with other companies extends its
reach into other therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular
disease, CNS disorders, endocrine and metabolic diseases, and
cancer.

The company's president and CEO is Dr. Jeremy Levin, who is both a
Ph.D. and an M.D.  Levin previously was vice president of corporate
development at Integrated Genetics (now part of Genzyme) and before
that, was the founder of Odyssey Biomedical.

The technological focus of Cadus lies in signal-transduction
pathways and their use as screening tools for the discovery of
compounds that may serve as drugs. A signal-transduction pathway
is the mechanism by which cells respond to messenger chemicals from
the "outside world." Messenger chemicals such as hormones and
growth factors impinge on the outer surface of cells, landing on
receptor substances that accomodate the size, shape, and chemical
binding ability of the messengers.

This binding of messenger chemical to cell receptor ultimately
triggers an action by the cell, perhaps to commence multiplying,
perhaps to commence secreting a substance.  The mechanism by which
the initial messenger-receptor interaction is transmitted as
information to the innards of the cell is what is meant by the
signal-transduction pathway.  It is a relay system, in which
peptides at the inner surface may join up to form larger, and
biologically active proteins; in which phosphorylating enzymes
become activated and commence to phosphorylate and thereby activate
the next enzyme in the series; and in which other subtle molecular
and biochemical events proceed.

One of the most common types of signal-transduction pathways is the
G-protein coupled type; more than 1,000 such receptors having been
identified to date. G-protein receptors, for instance, underlie the
actions of such hormones as adrenaline, angiotensin, glucagon,
luteinizing hormone, and vasopressin, and such neurotransmitters as
acetylcholine, enkephalin, and endorphin.

Such receptors also mediate odorants in the neuroepithelial cells
of the nose and light striking  the rod and cone cells comprising
the retina of the eye. They apparently play a role in Alzheimer's
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and
some cancers.

Binding of the initial messenger to the receptor causes a change in
the structure of the G protein, which in turn has the effect of
activating an associated enzyme, such as adenylyl cyclase, cyclic
guanosine monophosphate cyclase orphospholipase C.  The action of
the enzyme generates a second messenger substance, this time
operating inside the cell, that through one or more steps results
in the cell's ultimate behavior.

Cadus's key accomplishment is the construction of intact human G-
protein signal transduction material in yeast through genetic
engineering. These yeast constructs are usable as screening tools
to identify compounds that affect the biological activity of a
specific target within the signaling pathway. Another of the firm's
platform technologies looks at compounds interacting with other
signal transduction targets, such as tyrosine/MAP/MEK kinases,
multisubunit immune recognition receptors and G-protein coupled
receptors.

An offshoot that Cadus has developed is yeast-screening technology
capable of identifying functional ligands for orphan receptors.  So
far, only about 10% of the human receptors have known functions.
The other 90% are orphans -- nobody knowns what they do. Cadus has
constructed genetically engineered yeast cells expressing orphan
receptors, which and can be used as screening tools.

Among many challenge peptides inserted into the yeast, binding of
the right one to the orphan receptor will allow the yeast  cell to
grow.  This agonistic peptide can then be recovered and identified
for further studies. One critical look is to see what effect this
peptide has on human cells, and thereby to ascertain whether the
associated orphan receptor merits attention for drug-development
efforts.

Bristol-Myers Squibb endorses Cadus's work through its continuing
financial support.  BMS provided its initial support in July 1994
and added an additional $5 million equity investment in November
1995.  Ultimately, Cadus could receive more than $45 million from
BMS under all the terms of the agreement. Solvay Duphar (Brussels,
Belgium) is another supporter, one that in November 1995 gave Cadus
$10 million in a deal ultimately worth perhaps up to $50 million.

The latest news is that Cadus has obtained a patent (U.S. No.
5,482,835) protecting its yeast-based, human signal-transduction
screening technology for drug discovery.

Apparently, people are beginning to realize that the Human Genome
Project tells only part of the story.  Within the next five to 10
years, all the human genes will have been identified and sequenced.
But so what? It will still be necessary to identify the roles
played by the genes and to ascertain all the interplays among the
genes' proteins. That is what Cadus claims to have a jump on.
