<h2>Refrigerant Subcooling</h2>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>
<br>Refrigerant subcooling is a demonstrated and reliable way of increasing cooling capacity, and is
proving to have energy-saving potential to conventional air-conditioning systems for Federal facilities.
Effectiveness of the technology is based on the properties of refrigerants, which absorb latent heat until
they vaporize. In general, the benefits of subcooling are higher in regions with constantly high
year-round temperatures; several of these new subcooling devices have been installed in the
Washington, D.C. area, seven of them in Federal facilities. Most installations are custom-designed to
obtain optimum system performance. 

<p>The Federal Technology Alert focuses on a relatively new variation on subcooling technology, which
utilizes an external heat sink (mini-cooling tower or ground-source water). The technology is proving
particularly applicable in direct-expansion vapor-compression air-conditioning equipment, especially
where old units are being replaced or where new construction/expansion or new installation is planned.
It is not recommended as an add-on device. 

<p>For detailed info on this technology, see <a href="http://w3.pnl.gov:2080/fta/1_refrig.htm">Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory's Federal Technology Alert on Refrigerant
Subcooling</a>.
