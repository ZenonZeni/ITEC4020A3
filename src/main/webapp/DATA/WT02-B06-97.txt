<H3>Statement of <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~leahy">Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT)</A> Regarding The Vice President's<BR>
Announcement on Commercial Encryption Policy<BR>
July 12,1996</H3>
<PRE>
The Vice President's announcement today shows forward movement.
Unfortunately, this movement can be measured in inches rather than leaps
and bounds.  While most of us had hoped the Administration would take some
bold steps forward, they have only crept ahead inches.  Considering where
the Administration has been, I am thankful at least for this very timid
move.

The Administration appears ready to sit down at the table and talk
to Members of Congress, civil liberties groups and industry about
legislation that will ensure the freedom of Americans to use any encryption
systems domestically, liberalize export controls, transfer jurisdiction
over the export of encryption products to the Commerce Department from the
State Department, and encourage development by industry--not the
government--of strong encryption for commercial use.  These are all key
elements of encryption legislation I have sponsored with Senators Burns,
Lott,  Murray, Wyden and others.

I remain concerned that the Administration places too much reliance
on a system in which individuals must turn over their most private decoding
keys to another party.  But I look forward to working with the
Administration in a bipartisan manner to make sure that progress is made
this Congress.  There is much at stake here for our privacy and our
economy. We urgently need, as the Vice President acknowledges, a "clear
policy and direction."
