<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>"Living with Schizophrenia" Consumer Education Program</H2>
<H4>by Maggie Scheie-Lurie, NAMI Consumer Outreach Coordinator
</H4></font>
<hr>

	An exciting new NAMI consumer-education program--premiered at 
NAMI's annual convention in Nashville last July--is now available 
for presentation in multiple settings.   Divided into two sections, 
the "Living with Schizophrenia" program offers consumers a message 
of hope, scientific information about brain biology and treatment, 
and suggested coping strategies that support recovery.  Although it 
specifically addresses schizophrenia, the program is suitable for 
people who have other diagnoses, for people with any serious brain 
disorder.
<P>
	The program materials, available from NAMI, were designed in a 
flexible, two-session format--a video and a slide presentation--
that can be presented in a variety of settings, such as at local 
and state AMI meetings, support groups, hospitals, and community 
mental health centers.
<P>
		The opening video features four role-model consumers sharing 
their personal experiences in six segments:  Dark Days, Acceptance, 
Medications, Coping, Success, and Hopes and Dreams.  Time should be 
allocated so that discussion can follow the video presentation. 
<P>
		The second session is based on a set of slides that cover 
current understanding of schizophrenia as a brain disorder, the 
importance of treatment, and aspects of recovery discussed in the 
video.  Take-home material reinforces the messages of both the 
video and slides, but discussion time should be scheduled after the 
slides in this session, too.  A brief presentation on N/AMI 
membership immediately following the program offers audience 
members an opportunity to join the organization. 
<P>
	An essential feature of "Living with Schizophrenia" is that it 
is to be presented by consumers.  This is because: 1) consumer 
presenters serve as role models for other consumers; 2) people 
recovering from brain disorders are often more comfortable with and 
receptive to others who have a similar disorder; and 3) public 
speaking gives consumers an opportunity to develop new skills and 
build confidence.
<P>
		The "Living with Schizophrenia" program serves multiple 
functions:  it educates consumers about living successfully with 
brain disorders, it promotes consumer and professional membership, 
it supports awareness of AMI in the community, and it provides a 
vehicle for consumers wanting to do outreach and public speaking.
<P>
		A limited number of kits is available.  State AMIs have been 
asked to sponsor the program in their states and to coordinate 
presentations.  AMI members interested in bringing this program to 
their local area should contact their state AMI office to make 
arrangements.
<P>

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">AMI CARE, A Place For Consumers</font>
<P>
		Affiliates seeking to offer support to people with brain 
disorders should consider starting an AMI-CARE group.  Created by 
AMI of McHenry County in Illinois more than two years ago, AMI 
CARE--CARE stands for Consumers Advocating Recovery through 
Empowerment--provides a simple format for AMI-sponsored consumer 
peer-support groups.   These groups welcome people with all 
diagnoses and address issues common to most consumers regardless of 
diagnosis:  social isolation, lack of self-esteem, and the effects 
of stigma.  
<P>
		Depression, bipolar disorder (manic depression), 
schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are only some of the diagnoses 
of individuals who have found a supportive place within AMI CARE.  
AMI CARE meetings provide the same type of warmth that the caring 
and sharing meetings have given to so many family members over the 
years.  They provide a safe place for individuals to talk about the 
say-to-day challenges of living with a brain disorder.
<P>
		The mission of AMI CARE is:  "We are a fellowship of 
individuals who share a common goal of recovery and the ability to 
maintain mental and emotional stability.  We help ourselves and 
others through sharing out experiences, strength, and hope with 
each other.  No matter how traumatic our past or how despairing our 
present may be, there is hope for a new day with AMI CARE.
<P>
 	Members of AMI CARE groups learn about treatment methods from 
each other and find much-needed support so they are better able to 
cope.  As they grow within the group, many members become involved 
in educationa and advocacy through their local and state AMIs and 
stand with others to end stigma and discrimination.
<P>
		AMI CARE  start-up kits, available from NAMI, include:  a 
facilitator leader's guide, a manual on First Steps in Starting a 
Support Group for Primary Consumers within a Local AMI Affiliate, 
and a sample brochure to use in promoting the group.  To obtain the 
kit, please fill out and return the form below.
	<P>	
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Seeking Input From Existing AMI CARE Groups</font>
<P>
		Local affiliates and state organizations already using AMI 
CARE material are asked to notify  NAMI's consumer outreach 
coordinator, Maggie Scheie-Lurie (see form).  An expanded, updated 
start-up kit is in development, and we want suggestions from 
current groups regarding possible revisions.  Additionally, we want 
to determine the number of existing AMI CARE groups and identify 
group leaders.
