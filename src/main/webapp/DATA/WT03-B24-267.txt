<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - How can Michael Eisner, CEO of the Walt Disney 
Company, afford to pay himself $97,600 an hour? Easy. He 
contracts manufacturers who pay workers in Haiti who sew 
Pocahantas, Mickey Mouse and other Disney clothing for 28 
cents an hour.</p>

<p>Responding to this and many other abusive conditions 
prevalent in the factories where The Disney Company gets its 
clothing manufactured, some 200 persons demonstrated in 
front of the Disney Store in midtown Manhattan Dec. 14. The 
National Labor Committee, a non-profit human rights advocacy 
group which has exposed the link between U.S. multinationals 
and sweatshops around the world, organized the protest.</p>

<p>Thousands of Christmas shoppers going into the store and 
passing by it were surprised to see protesters dressed up as 
Santa Claus, Mickey and Minnie Mouse and other Disney 
characters. Demonstrators passed out leaflets denouncing 
Disney's link to production shops with horrendous working 
conditions.</p>

<p>Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, 
detailed the abuses in "An Open Letter to Walt Disney." He 
wrote the letter earlier this year after returning from 
Haiti where he witnessed the conditions under which Disney 
manufactures the clothing which carries its label. Disney 
has contracted L.V. Myles and H.H. Cutler, which in turn 
contract production to L.V. Myles, N.S. Mart, Classic and 
Gilanex in Haiti.</p>

<p>In his letter Kernaghan states that N.S. Mart, located in 
the Sonapi Industrial Park, pays its workers 28 cents an 
hour. But to earn this a worker on the assembly line had to 
handle 375 Pocahantas shirts an hour. A week's salary was 
not enough to buy one of the shirts which sell at Wal-Mart 
for $10.97.</p>

<p>At a secret meeting with Kernaghan, workers told him 
management screamed and threatened them and young women are 
subjected to sexual assault by management. Toilets are 
filthy and there are rats everywhere, including dead ones in 
the water tank.</p>

<p>"Mickey's for Kids Stuff" is made at the Classic Apparel 
factory which is managed by John Paul Medina, a former 
member of the Fraph Death Squad which killed thousands of 
Haitians during the dictatorship. When President Jean-
Bertrande Aristide raised the minimum wage, Medina responded 
by increasing the daily piece rate quota from 720 to 1,200 
collars in eight hours.</p>

<p>Working conditions at other factories visited by Kernaghan 
were just as miserable. There are no applicable labor codes 
and even being suspected of trying to organize to improve 
working conditions is enough to get anyone fired.</p>

<p>Living conditions for the working class are deplorable. 
Since milk is too expensive, children are given sugar water. 
Parents are unable to afford medicines or meat for their 
children. Cough syrup costs a day's wage, $1.54, and a can 
of powdered milk $3.08. Since workers' neighborhoods do not 
have running water they must buy it by the bucket. A one-
room shack may be home for an entire family, and often 
several families must share a hole in the ground as a 
toilet.</p>

<p>Kernaghan's letter lists four proposals which the workers 
made to Disney: 1) that Disney send representatives to meet 
with them so that they may learn what their working and 
living conditions are.</p>

<p>2) help clean up the factories and guarantee respect for 
human rights including the right to organize.</p>

<p>3) an increase in wages to 58 cents an hour.</p>

<p>4) that local human rights organizations have access to the 
factories to monitor conditions as they do with factories 
contracted by the GAP.</p>

<p>The demonstration in front of the Disney Store ended with a 
march up Fifth Avenue. Nick Unger from the Union of Needle, 
Industrial and Textile Employees told the crowd Disney had 
to be made responsible for the sweatshop conditions in 
Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti and New York.</p>
