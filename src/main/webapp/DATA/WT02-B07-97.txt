<title>Sen. Leahy Letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
<br>
November 3, 1995
<p>
<p>
The Honorable Louis J. Freeh<br>
Federal Bureau of Investigation<br>
J. Edgar Hoover Building<br>
9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue<br>
Washington, D.C.  20035<br>
<p>
Dear Director Freeh:
<p>
Congress took the important step in the last Congress of passing the "Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act" (CALEA) to ensure that in cases of significant criminal activity, ranging from terrorism to kidnapping, law enforcement would continue to be able to execute court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies are loosing their capability to use that important tool in the face of new and advanced telecommunications technologies.
<p>
Just as significantly, this new law also brings decisions affecting the privacy of our Nation's telephone system under statutory guidance and into the sunshine.  CALEA requires that law enforcement's demands regarding the number of wiretap orders that telephone companies must be able to service simultaneously, are published in the Federal Register and scrutinized in a public procedure.
<p>
The process set up in CALEA is working.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently published in the Federal Register a proposed notice of law enforcement's capacity demands predicated upon an historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity.  The Federal Register notice did not include publication of those two documents.
<p>
Please provide me with copies of those two documents, which I also urge you to release to the public and publish in the Federal Register to ensure the fullest dissemination of the information.
<p>
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
<p>

PATRICK J. LEAHY
United States Senator
