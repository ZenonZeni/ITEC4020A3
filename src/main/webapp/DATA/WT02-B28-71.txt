<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Key Employee Protection: Preserving the Life of Your
Business</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Plan Today for the Future</STRONG><BR>
As a business owner, you recognize the importance of insuring your building,
inventory and
equipment.
These assets are vital to the success of your company. But have you considered what
would
happen if
your key employees died unexpectedly
or became disabled?<P>
Key employees are the foundation of a successful business. They are business
owners, sales
directors, CFOs or any other individuals who are sources of leadership,
profitability, and
would be
extremely difficult to replace. Unless the proper steps are taken, the death or
disability of
your key
employees can be devastating to the financial well-being of your company. 
<P>
<STRONG>The Solution: Key Employee Protection</STRONG> <BR>
New York Life can provide you with strategies that will help continue your business
in the
event of a key
employee's death or disability. Funding a plan to protect key employees will give
your
business the
additional funds it needs at a difficult time to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hire and train replacements.
<LI>Replace an employee's contribution to profits. 
<LI>Maintain the confidence of clients and creditors.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Funding Options</STRONG><BR>

<STRONG>Option 1: Cash or Sinking Fund</STRONG><BR>
In this option, a business establishes a savings plan, much like a bank account, to
protect
itself from
the death or disability of its key employees. At death, the cash in the savings
plan is used
as a source
of funding. Unfortunately, this method has several drawbacks:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow?
<LI>A savings plan may be depleted to pay for other expenses.
<LI>Accumulated cash could cause an accumulated earnings problem.
<LI>The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar, thus depleting the amount of
cash that
could be used elsewhere.
</UL>

<STRONG>Option 2: Borrowing Funds</STRONG><BR>
In this option, funds are borrowed, usually a bank loan, to replace the financial
loss caused
by a key
employee's death or disability. Drawbacks of this option include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A potential slow-down in business growth due to additional loan repayments.
<LI>A reduction in future profits may occur because of the loan repayment.
<LI>The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar plus interest.
<LI>The company's credit may be adversely affected due to greater debt.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Option 3: Insurance: The Cost Effective Alternative</STRONG><BR>
Purchasing life and/or disability insurance on your key employees is a cost
effective way to
safeguard
your business and minimize the impact of a key employee's death or disability.
It will provide your business with the following advantages:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Funding with insurance is easy to administer.
<LI>Funding costs pennies on the dollar.
<LI>Funds are available even if death or disability occurs tomorrow.
<LI>Although the premiums are not deductible, the insurance proceeds at death are
generally
received
income tax free to the business.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>SETTING UP THE PLAN</STRONG><BR>
<P>

<p>
The business applies for a life insurance policy on the life of a key employee. The
business
is the
owner and beneficiary of the policy.
