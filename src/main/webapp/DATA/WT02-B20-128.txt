 Dr. Carlos Cort&eacute;s, internationally known author and speaker in the field of diversity and multiculturalism, will be the keynote speaker for CEC's 1997 Symposium on Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Exceptional Learners. The symposium will be held January 8-10, 1997, at the Radisson Hotel in New Orleans, LA.  <P>
	In his keynote speech, Cort&eacute;s will look at future trends in multiculturalism and what they mean for education. The symposium audience will get a new perspective on how schools and educators must change to provide educational content and strategies that prepare students to function in a world that must accommodate peoples of all cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities.<P>
	Cort&eacute;s' presentation will outline changes in educational practices that allow students of 
all abilities and disabilities to build on their individual strengths and backgrounds. He will
 address issues that today's educators face as they work with students of diverse cultures, such as language development, adapting curriculum, the development of social skills, and assessment.<P>
	Cort&eacute;s gained international recognition for his publications on multicultural issues,  including Three Perspectives on Ethnicity: Blacks, Chicanos, and Native Americans and Beyond Language: Social and Cultural Factors in Schooling Language Minority Students. He has also lectured widely throughout the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia on multiculturalism and diversity and has served as a consultant to government agencies, school systems, universities, mass media, businesses, and other organizations. In addition, Cort&eacute;s was  named Professor Emeritus of History at the University of California, Riverside.<P>
	Cort&eacute;s has received several awards for his work, including the National Multicultural Trainer of the Year Award, the Faculty Public Service Award, the Smithsonian Institution Public Lecturer, and the Hilda Taba Award of the California Council for Social Studies.<P>
	The symposium's sessions address the most compelling and critical issues involving students with special needs of diverse backgrounds, giving insights into current problems as well as practical tools and solutions.<P>
	The symposium is co-sponsored by CEC's Division for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Exceptional Learners and the Louisiana State Department of Education.<P>
