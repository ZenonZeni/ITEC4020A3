<H1><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Program Arctic Ocean - 96, : Remote sensing
and sea ice program. </FONT></CENTER></H1>
<P>
Note: The program represents the aims as planned before the expedition
start. The actual program was determined by the ice situation
and changes in the planned route. 
<H2>Leg 1: Sea ice melt period; program related to meltponds and
general ice properties.</H2>
<P>
Ice properties are recorded together with meteorological information
in the trafficability report. The same observations will take
place on Polarstern and the reports will be co-ordinated. G&ouml;ran
Liljestr&ouml;m is the only representative but he will obtain
help from the Russian ice experts onboard. Visual observations
of area coverage of one year, two year and multi year ice is important.
Of special importance during this leg is the meltpond coverage
and melt pond properties e.g. size distributions.
<P>
 To extend the ship observations video recordings from the helicopter
will be carried out together with ice reconnaissance. Such observations
should be checked during the cruise for consistency with the bridge
observations.
<P>
 With only G&ouml;ran Liljestr&ouml;m in the program field work
has to be concentrated to the cases when stops are taking place
during days with satellite imaging.
<P>
 The melt period extends somewhat into leg 2. It should be noted
that the meltpond coverage is varying between first year (30-50%)
and multiyear ice (20-30%). 
<P>
Embarking: G&ouml;teborg
<H2>Leg 2: Sea ice freeze-up period, program related to the variability
of the ice properties including melting conditions</H2>
<P>
The melt period extends somewhat into leg 2. Melt ponds are of
interest from many points of view including the fact that major
parts of the roughness characterisation of the ice surface is
related to the melt ponds. The melting is also related to radiation
properties and radiation measurements 300-1100 nm will be performed
within snow and ice and in the water beneath the ice, in leads
and meltponds. Possibilities to characterise one year, two year
and multi year ice is generally important.
<P>
 As the variability of the ice is the most interesting aspect,
as the time within the ice is limited to two - three weeks, and
as the program is split between the two ships reducing the effectiveness
in characterising sea ice properties we have asked for a stop
once per day or at least 14 - 15 stops for making field observations
together with helicopeter observations. The helicopter observations
are particularly important together with the longer stops when
more extensive ice information can be obtained. This should be
combined with satellite images and the route should then be related
to the satellite acquisitions.
<P>
 Helicopter observations are performed using scatterometer and
video in order to have observe mesoscale variations. Larger areas
are covered in a zig-zag manner by helicopter making scatterometer
observations (altitude 100 m) followed by separate videofilming
from higher altitude. GPS and time information important for localization.
Photographs from helicopter are also very good complements (time
noted). Notes on ice properties of area important. 
<P>
 The stopping time needs to be 3 - 12 hours depending on the program.
The ice structure and microstructure will be measured (3 hours)
followed by sediment and sediment redistribution observations
(3 hours). Radiation properties can be measured in parallell.
For excavating an ice trench and for optical measurements at different
depth of the ice, for drilling of ice cores (note G&ouml;ran Liljestr&ouml;m
will have equipment for quick drilling of 1.5 m ice cores for
which temperature profiles and salinity can be determined by the
sea ice group) and determining temperature, salinity and DEP (dielectric
profiling of conductance and capacitance at several frequencies
1- 100 kHz) of the ice cores up to 12 hours is necessary. Short
stops will be used for observations adjacent to the ship as well
as observations away from the ship while the ship is moving. Longer
stops are necessary for some of the program elements as well as
for wide area coverage of ice information and helicopter observations.
Areas covered by helicopter scatterometer should also be characterized
by surface observations made by team using skidoos. Surface properties,
snow layer (thickness), aged ice surface (thickness, properties),
roughness characterization (mechanical pin device with a measurment
grid behind + photographs), snow wetness, roughness properties,
snow and ice temperature (particularly when temperature of ice
is close to zero), ice ridge properties (height, width, block
sizes, block roughness on various sizes). Thin ice and occurence
of frost flower important information. Thickness of ice is determined
by means of radio echo soundings using 50 or 400 Mhz along transects
using man-hauled or using skidoo.
<P>
 The ice information also includes 
<P>
 Radio beacons have been placed to localise three areas of ice
with different properties during 1995. Due to the drift pattern
these areas will have drifted to the area where leg 2 starts or
even further north. Revisiting at least one of these areas is
very important, but depending on the most recent location information
from the beacon. (This program point not possible to carry out
as the ice drift was larger than anticipated.)
<P>
 The group has 25 hours of helicopter time available which is
approximately the same time as 1991. Due to the risk for bad flying
conditions we have to agree on a priority list such as (1) revisiting
of one beacon-site, (2) area coverage with helicopter borne scatterometer,
(3) area coverage by video.
<P>
Embarking: Lominosov Ridge
<H2>Leg 1 + 2 Remote sensing</H2>
<P>
The remote sensing program is mainly related to ERS-2 and Radarsat
for which Jan Askne and Hajo Eicken are PI:s for different projects
which we will try to coordinate. ERS-2 needs direct contact with
a ground station which limits the coverage to the first parts
of Leg 1. Radarsat has the capability to store data onboard and
dump it over Canada. The delays in the delivery of data are not
yet quite clear.
<P>
NOAA AVHRR data is of interest to combine with radiation measurements
on the ice and with SAR data. High resolution data will be obtained
at Polarstern, low resolution on Oden.
<P>
Okean data will be received on Polarstern and possibly Oden if
possible. The nominal lifetime of the satellite is already over.
<P>
SSM/I data is planned to be combined with Radarsat data.
