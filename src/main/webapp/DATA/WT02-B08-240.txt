<H1 align=center>SPRI LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES: AN OVERVIEW</H1>

The Library of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI Library) offers
the world's premier polar information centre.  Sited within a department
of the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>, this is
a resource of national and international importance consulted by
governments, industry, scientists and scholars.  The Library also houses
<a href="../wdcc.htm">World Data Centre C for Glaciology</a>, with special
responsibilities for the provision of information to British and European
glaciologists, and the <a href="../archmus.htm">SPRI Archives</a>, 
containing the world's finest collection of unpublished material relating 
to the polar regions.<p>

For scientists and scholars, SPRI Library offers a collection developed
since the 1920s with over 1000 current journals, 27,500 books and 44,000
pamphlets covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, and
to ice and snow wherever found.  For industry, it is a prime information
source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural
resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the
polar regions;  on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection
of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold
environments.  For Government users, the Library offers an unrivalled
resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence. 

<H2>Holdings</H2>

<H3>Arctic collections</H3> These are unique in covering all countries of
the circumpolar north for all subjects and in all languages.  No other
library is similarly comprehensive.  Particular strengths are the
substantial collections relating to the Arctic Ocean, to the European
Arctic, and to the Russian North.  The Russian North holdings are
considered to be the most extensive outside the former Soviet Union and
the Library of Congress.<p>

The definition adopted for the Arctic is broadly that of <b><i>The
circumpolar north</b></i> (Armstrong, Rogers and Rowley, 1978), with minor
modifications affecting south-east Alaska and Labrador.  Seas covered are
the Arctic Ocean and adjacent waters: the various seas north of Russia
(Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara and White seas); Barents Sea;
Norwegian Sea; Greenland Sea; Labrador Sea; Davis Strait and Baffin Bay; 
Hudson Bay; Lincoln Sea; waters of the Canadian Arctic Islands; Beaufort
Sea; Ber ing Sea; the Sea of Okhotsk; and the Gulf of Alaska.  Land areas
covered include Alaska (except for the Panhandle); the Canadian
Territories (Yukon and Northwest); those parts of Quebec and Labrador
occupied by the Inuit; Greenland; Iceland (natural histo ry only);
Svalbard; the European Arctic south to the Arctic Circle; and the Russian
Federation south to 63 deg. in European Russia and to 57 deg. in Asia,
including all of Kamchatka and Sakhalin.<p>

<H3>Antarctic collections</H3> 

Probably the most famous collections in the Library and without peer
anywhere, both for the continent itself and for the surrounding ocean and
sub-Antarctic islands. <p>

Those interested in the history of the Antarctic should ask the Librarian 
about the <b>Antarctica Retrospective</b> project.<p>

The Antarctic is taken to include the continent itself together with its
surrounding waters and islands north to the Antarctic Convergence but
including also those Peri-Antarctic islands occurring north of this zone
but still strongly subject to Antarctic influences (Gough Island, the New
Zealand Sub-Antarctic Islands, Iles Amsterdam and Saint-Paul, Iles Crozet,
Macquarie Island, and the Prince Edward Islands).  This area corresponds
to the zone of interest of the Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR).  Because of their long association with
British Antarctic activities, the library also aims to maintain good, but
not exhaustive, holdings for the Falkland Islands and Tristan da Cunha
focusing particularly on natural history and on historical and political
issues with an Antarctic dimension.<p>

<H3>Glaciological collections</H3> 

With over 100 current periodicals, 30,000 entries on glaciology and
related subjects in the <a href="sprilib.htm">SPRILIB</a> database
together with an equivalent number of entries in the card catalogue, the
glaciological holdings maintained by <a href="../wdcc.htm">World Data 
Centre C for Glaciology</a> are as extensive as those found anywhere.<p>

WDC-C has adopted a broad definition of the scope of glaciology collecting
publications on all topics relating to snow and ice in all languages and
for all parts of the world.  The glaciology collection is thus not
restricted to the polar regions.  Among subjects included are glacial
geology, geocryology, glacioastronomy, and snow and ice engineering.<p>

<H2>Universal Decimal Classification for Use in Polar Libraries</H2>

The strength of the Library lies as much in the detail of its
long-established cataloguing practice as in the size and coverage of the
collection itself.  Since its foundation, a policy has been maintained of
providing information access points to items at the analytic and not just
at the main entry level.  Each entry provides sufficient bibliographic
information for identification and location of the source document
together with a brief abstract and appropriate index numbers derived from
the <b><i>Universal Decimal Classification for Use in Polar
Libraries</b></i> (4th edition, 1994), developed and maintained by SPRI
Library and used by many other polar libraries.  All cataloguing, indexing
and abstracting is carried out by specialist bibliographers possessing a
range of linguistic, regional and subject expertise.  Since 1985, all
records have been entered in the <a href="../sprilib.htm">SPRILIB</a> 
bibliographic database. 

<H2>Financial support:</H2>

SPRI Library is a departmental library of the University of Cambridge,
supported by grants from the <a href="http://www.nerc-bas.ac.uk">NERC
British Antarctic Survey</a>, the UK Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, the governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand,
and from private individuals.  World Data C for Glaciology, the European
documentation centre for glaciological information, is funded by the <a
href="http://britac3.britac.ac.uk/rs/>Royal Society</a>.<p>
