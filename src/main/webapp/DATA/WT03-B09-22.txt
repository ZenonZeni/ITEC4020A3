IDG COMMUNCIATIONS TO ENTER ROMANIAN MARKET

International Data Group (Boston, MA) has established the
first computer publication in Romania. The company said
that "InfoClub" magazine will be published six times a year
and will have an initial circulation of 60,000. IDG said
that it will publish the magazine in association with
Stiinta si Technica Publishing Company (Bucharest), the
largest technical publishing company in Romania.

IDG chairman patrick McGovern, who recently returned from
Romania after negotiating with Stiinta si Technica, said
that Romanians spent over $105 million in 1990 to acquire
computer hardware, software and services and that "in 1991,
we expect the (Romanian) market to increase 35% to over
$140 million." He said that the "vast majority of this
amount will be for imported equipment, providing an
attractive market for the world computer industry."

"InfoClub" chief editor Ioan Albescu said that Romania had
about 60,000 computers presently installed and that he
expected that amount to increase substantially. He said
that the country needs both computers and communications
technology to provide for its economic development under
the new economic and political systems.

According to Albescu, half of the editorial content of the
start-up will be devoted to IBM-compatible personal
computers, with the remainder covering the technology and
applications of other computer companies. Because it will
be the only computer publication in the country, he said
that editorial dealing with mainframes and minicomputers
will also be included.

IDG also publishes computer magazines in Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

and local administrators, attorneys, consultants, public
interest advocates, lobbyists, researchers and librarians.

Editorial for the newsletter includes coverage of local,
state and regional environmental developments as well as
perspective and analysis of the range of environmental
issues facing the state of California. In addition, the

developments, publica nd private initiatives, enforcement
actions and legal activities and their potential
implications for other parts of the country.

BNA International has begun the publication of "World
Pharmaceutical Standards Review". The monthly newsletter is
designed to "fill the increasing need for in-depth analysis
of the worldwide regulatory, legal and technical
developments affecting" the pharmaceutical industry. It is
being marketed to those in government, international
organizations, industry and business, research groups, law
firms and libraries.

BNA said that editorial for the letter will include
information on health and safety standards, testing and
certification, product authorization, research, patents,

government actions. It will include coverage of countries
within the European Community, particularly in light of the
economic integration sought by 1992, the U.S., Japan and

BNA ceo William Beltz said that research revealed that "a
need exists for a publication that analyzes trends and ties
together seemingly unconnected developments affecting the
pharmaceutical industry worldwide."

A/S/M COMMUNICATIONS TO LAUNCH "MEDIA WEEK" ON JANUARY 14

A/S/M Communications (New York) will begin the publication
of "Media Week" magazine with an issue on Jan. 14. In
OCTOBEr, A/S/M, a subsidiary of Billboard Publications Inc.
(New York), acquired the monthly "Marketing & Media
Decisions" from Act III Publishing (New York) and decided
to change title and frequency.

A/S/M said that the new weekly will cover media news and
trends. A/S/M chairman John Thomas, Jr. said that "we will
now publish three different weeklies ("Adweek," "Adweek's
Marketing Week" and "Media Week"), each one tailored for
its audience." He said that the three publications give
readers the magazines they need. "We'll be offering
advertisers the best general coverage among agencies and
clients, plus highly targeted coverage at the media
departments of every top agency."

Newly appointed publisher Lawrence Oliver said that "never
before have people had to keep up with so many aspects of
the media business as they do today." The new launch "will
be able to keep on top of the latest developments. The news
value of the publication is going to hinge on timeliness.
The big change in the marketplace today is the number of
alternative types of media that can be bought. It's a lot
to keep up on."

Oliver said that the publication will be targeted to media
executives at all levels at ad agencies.

A/S/M became a subsidiary of BPI Communications in July of
this year. BPI also publishes a number of media properties,
including "Billboard," "Back Stage" and "American Film"
magazines.

GRO COM GROUP TO LAUNCH "DELI-BAKE ADVOCATE" IN JUNE

Gro Com Group (Clearwater, FL) will begin the publication
of "Deli-Bake Advocate" with an issue in June. The new
magazine will be published six times a year and will have
an initial controlled circulation of 15,000. The first
issue will debut at the International Dairy-Deli
Association in Anaheim (CA).

According to co-publisher Mark Weeks, the publication will
link buyers and sellers "in an effective and affordable
manner." He said that the magazine will serve as an
important forum for companies who are "serious about
profiting from the rapidly growing deli-bake industry."

The company said the publication will be targeted as an
informational and marketing tool to deli-bake managers,
distributors and brokers. Weeks said that the circulation
list has been drawn from such sources as the International
Dairy-Deli Association, the Retail Bakers of
America/International Deli-Bake Association and verified
and qualified yellow page directories.

Weeks said he hoped that circulation will grow each year to
accomodate the demands of the industry. He said the
circulation is ultimately expected to reach between 30,000
and 40,000.

Editorial for the publication will cover ideas for
merchandising and promotion, industry trends, category
updates from industry experts, legal issues involved in
importing and exporting meats and cheeses, safety,
strategies and new products.

The company had originally planned to launch the
publication in January. The delay till June is due to
"advertising softness," Weeks said. Gro Com also publishes
"Food Distribution Magazine."

a year, a subscription delivered by facsimile machine costs
$295. The letter is sent every Monday morning to

comes down the pike," co-publisher Kathleen Tinkel said,
only those items deemed sufficiently relevent.

The company said that it wanted to see that the legitimate
complaints of users were documented without appearing to be
engaged in "vendor bashing." The purpose of the publication
is to correct mistakes and to show what is successful, the
company said.

GRALLA PUBLICATIONS LAUNCHES "CORPORATE TRAVEL'S STRATEGIC
MEETINGS"

Gralla Publications (New York), a subsidiary of United
Newspapers (London), has begun the publication of

"Strategic Meetings" as a supplement to the company's
"Corporate Travel" magazine.

"Corporate Travel" is a monthly with a controlled
circulation of 46,000. Gralla said that the new supplement
will fill the gap between the meeting planning and
management training markets. The company said that
editorial for the publication focuses on the results of
corporate meetings and how those results could have been
different. Gralla said that special attention is being paid
to elements of group interaction within the meetings. The
publication will have "more of a management focus" than
other publications in the field, Gralla said.

The publication is being targeted to ceo's, presidents,
vice presidents and other corporate executives involved in
the meetings process. The publication will analyze factors
involved in a "good" meeting, including objectives, advance
preparation, agendas and results. Saying that most meetings
magazines talk about the logistics of meetings, Gralla said
that the new supplement will present information that
non-meeting executives can understand and act on.

Gralla said that it hoped to spin-off the publication
within the next year.

The supplement continues Gralla's recent expansion
activities. In April of this year, the company began the
publication of "V.I.P." magazine. In May, Gralla purchased
"Action Sports Retailer," "Outdoor Retailer" and two trade
shows from Pacifica Publishing. In August, the company
acquired "Wall Street Computer Review," "Insurance Software
Review," "Computer's in Banking" and "Communications in
Finance" from Investment Dealers' Digest. Also, Gralla will
begin the publication of "Gifts & Stationary Business" in
March 1991 and Sports Vision in January.

EDGELL FINDS BUYERS FOR SIX OF SEVEN PUBLICATIONS

Edgell Communications (Cleveland, OH) has found buyers for
six of the seven publications that it had put up for sale
in October. Because most of the deals have not yet been
closed, Edgell would identify only one of those buyers. In
addition, the company said that it was ceasing publication
of "Housewares" magazine after its December 15 issue.

The seven publications put up for sale include "Aqua,"
"Bicycle Dealer Showcase," "Petroleum Engineer
International," "Pipeline & Gas Journal," "World
Cogeneration," "Corporate Meetings & Incentives" and
"Communciations News."

Edgell spokesperson Mary Abood said that the company had
found buyers for all of the publications except "World
Cogeneration." She said that because most of deals would
not be finalized until after the new year, she could only
identify one buyer. Abood said The Laux Company (Maynard,
MA) had reached an agreement in principle to acquire
"Corporate Meetings & Incentives." Terms of the deal were
not revealed, but "TBP" estimates that the sale price was
about $1.7 million.

The Laux Company president Dean Laux said the purchase
allows "us to offer the largest circulation in existence
among meetings and travel executives. We see (the magazine)
becoming the flagship of our...group of publications for
the meetings and travel industry." The Laux Company also

publishes "Medical Meetings," "Insurance Conference
Planner," "Association Meetings" and "Religious Conference
Manager." "Corporate Meetings & Incentives" had estimated
1989 advertising revenues of $2 million, an increase of 5%
over the $1.9 million recorded in 1988.

Laux said that he plans no changes in staffing or location
(New York) for the magazine. The monthly has a controlled
circulation of 40,000.

"Housewares" was published 22 times a year and was targeted
to housewares merchandise managers, buyers and chain store
management personnel. Most of the editorial covered
merchandising ideas and retail strategies. It had a
controlled circulation of 13,000.

K-III CONFIRMS REPORTS OF INTEREST IN FIELD PUBLICATIONS

K-III Holdings (New York) has confirmed that it is in
negotiations for the acquisition of Field Publications
(Chicago, IL).

The proposed sale includes Field's book clubs, "Weekly
Reader" and other classroom periodicals and its Funk &
Wagnalls reference book unit. The "Weekly Reader" has a
circulation of about 10 million. The companies involved had
combined sales of about $300 million last year. It is
estimated that the purchase price will be around $250
million.

A major part of Field's business comes from licensing deals
with Walt Disney Co. However, Disney has announced that it
will soon organize its own children's book publishing
operation as soon as the current licensing Field has
terminated.

K-III currently owns some specialty book clubs and business
and professional magazines. The company acquired Reader's
Garden, Inc. last August. It added that property to its
Newbridge Communications division and made known its desire
for further acquisitions.

ACT III PUBLISHING CEASES PUBLICATION OF "CHANNELS"
MAGAZINE

Act III Publishing (New York), a subsidiary of Act III
Communications (Los Angeles), has ceased the publication of
"Channels" magazine. The company said that a suitable buyer
for the magazine could not be found.

The publication had a mostly-controlled circulation of
26,000. In an attempt to increase circulation earlier this
year, frequency for the publication was increased from 12
times to 24 times a year.

Taglined "the business of communication," the 10-year-old
magazine was targeted to television professionals as well
as lawyers, financial experts and advertisers. Editorial
provided business coverage of the electronic media,
television, cable, syndication and finance, in addition to
analyses, news of industry trends and profiles.

For the first six months of 1990, "Channels" had estimated
advertising revenues of $1.4 million, an increase of about
40% over the $1 million recorded during the first six
months of 1989. Estimated advertising pages for the period
increased 16%, going from 259 pages in 1989 to 301 pages
for 1990.

The magazine was purchased by C.C. Publishing, Act III's
percursor, in 1985 from Media Commentary Council (New
York). At that time it was a non-profit publication.

The demise of Channels continues Act III's decision to
divest itself of its business and professional magazine
properties. In September of this year, Act III ceased the
publication of both "BME's Television Engineering" and
"Corporate Video Decisions" and sold their circulation
lists to PSN Publications (New York). In October, the
company sold "Marketing & Media Decisions" to BPI
Communications (New York) and also ceased publication of
the six-month-old "The Marketer."

Act III also publishes "Mix" and "Electronic Musician"
magazines as well as "Biz News" newsletter.

WEST PUBLISHING INSTITUTES DIRECT ACCESS TO DIALOG
DATABASES

West Publishing Co. (St. Paul, MN) said that, beginning in
early 1991, a new interface will enable Westlaw legal
information service subscribers to access Dialog (Palo
Alto, CA) databases via the Westlaw directory and using
Westlaw commands. Dialog is a unit of Knight-Ridder.

The new arrangemenet supercedes, but does not replace, a
gateway previously established between the two companies
that required users to enter and use Dialog commands. The
new arrangement will provide Westlaw subscribers access to
140 Dialog databases, about one-third of Dialog's total.
The companies said that additional Dialog databases will be
added every month until all 380 are available, probably be
the end of 1991.

West president Dwight Opperman said that the dealw as
important because "law firms, coroporate legal departments,
and other users of computer- assisted legal research have
found it increasingly important to access news, business,
technical, and other information in addition to traditional
legal research." Access to Dialog "will enable legal
professionals to increase their efficiency."

The new gateway works only one way. Subscribers to Dialog
will not be able to access West databases. The companies
said that if a need for a two-way gateway is identified,
they will consider its implementation.

MILLER FREEMAN CANCELS COMPUTING CONFERENCE

Miller Freeman Expositions (Boston, MA) has canceled the
Supercomputing World 1991 conference originally scheduled
for June 18-20 in San Diego. The company said that the
"expectation of leaner economic times for vendors, and a

decision.

"NIKKEI BUSINESS" TO INCREASE FREQUENCY

Japan's largest professional publication, "Nikkei
Business," published by Nikkei Business Publications

year. The company said that the change was necessary to
meet the "rapid changes on the international business
environment as represented by the unification of Germany
and the invasion of Kuwait" and to adapt to the new
Japanese business practice of adopting five-day workweeks.
