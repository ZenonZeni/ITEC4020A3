BIG RIVERS AND PACIFICORP ARE EXPECTED TO SIGN THEIR DEAL BY END OF
JANUARY

By the end of January, Big Rivers Electric Corp. and PacifiCorp hope to
announce a ``letter of intent'' under which PacifiCorp would lease and
manage Big Rivers' coal-fired power plants in western Kentucky over the
next quarter century.
   ``We're working on it diligently right nowhopefully we'll see something
in the next two to three weeks,'' a PacifiCorp spokesman told Southeast
Power Report on Jan. 8. A spokeswoman for financially troubled Big Rivers,
based in Henderson, Ky., echoed that sentiment.
   Meanwhile, Big Rivers' two largest customers--Alcan Aluminum and
Southwire/NSA--were trying to insert themselves in the process to guarantee
that their desire for lower, more stable electric rates is addressed.
Together, aluminum smelters operated by Alcan and Southwire/NSA at Sebree
and Hawesville, Ky., respectively, consume nearly 70% of the electricity
generated by Big Rivers.
   The late December announcement that Big Rivers was negotiating with
PacifiCorp on a 25-year lease/operation agreement ended months of
speculation over which of several suitors would meet with Big Rivers'
approval.
   Even with the ongoing Big Rivers/PacifiCorp talks, however, several
suitors have not given up all hope. At least three--U.S. Generating, an
independent power producer, Cinergy Corp. and Louisville Gas &
Electric--reportedly believe they still have a chance if the PacifiCorp
discussions collapse.
   While neither Big Rivers nor PacifiCorp, an aggressive Portland,
Ore.-based investor-owned utility, apparently believes that will happen,
the Big Rivers spokeswoman stressed, ``We're not going to close any doors.
It wouldn't be wise considering the investment we've made in this process
so far.''
   Big Rivers has been trying to find a solution to its $1.2-billion debt,
much of which is owed to the Rural Utilities Service for construction of
the 440-MW D.B. Wilson coal-fired plant in the early 1980s. Some of the
offers submitted to Big Rivers were to buy the generation and transmission
cooperative and/or its generating assets.
   PacifiCorp's, however, was different. The Oregon utility would create a
subsidiary that would lease and operate Big Rivers' three plants: 480-MW
Green, 455-MW Coleman and Wilson, in addition to the 315-MW Station Two
plant that Big Rivers operates under a long-term contract with the owner,
the city of Henderson.
   The subsidiary would sell power to Big Rivers, which would resell it to
its four distribution cooperatives, Henderson-Union Electric Cooperative,
Jackson Purchase Rural Electric Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric
Cooperative and Green River Electric.
   Perhaps as importantly, if not more so, the PacifiCorp subsidiary also
would handle Big Rivers' coal-buying activities and sell surplus
electricity from the power plants to other utilities in the eastern U.S.
   Big Rivers' past coal-buying practices have been the subject of state
and federal investigations. They have resulted so far in the conviction of
three individuals on bribery/kickback charges involving former Big Rivers
general manager William Thorpe. Thorpe, who has denied any wrongdoing, is
expected to stand trial next summer on related charges.
   Most observers believe PacifiCorp, the largest wholesaler of bulk power
in the western U.S., would be more successful than Big Rivers has been in
marketing surplus power.
   ``We have said we want to take our core skills in that area and use it
in markets outside the West,'' said the PacifiCorp spokesman. ``We want to
do that in Kentucky.''

ENRON POWER MARKETING, OGLETHORPE IN 4-MONTH SALES, PURCHASE DEAL

Oglethorpe Power Corp. announced Jan. 5 that it began a major four-month
energy sales-and-purchase deal with Enron Power Marketing Inc. Under the
arrangement, Enron will have the first option to buy energy from
Oglethorpe's 5,000-MW system, while covering energy requirements of
Oglethorpe's 39 member cooperatives through April 30 (SPR, 29 Dec. 95, 1).
   Oglethorpe customers can expect to save ``several millions of dollars''
as a result of the arrangement because Enron will meet their needs at a
price lower than the current Oglethorpe energy charge. Enron expects to
make a profit on sales of energy which some Oglethorpe members cannot use.
   The two sides have not released details of the deal. However, Oglethorpe
officials acknowledged that a major selling point of the arrangement was
Enron's first option to all energy available from Oglethorpe plant
entitlements and contracts. Oglethorpe estimates that Enron will buy more
than 5.2-million MWh of energy over the four months.
   Oglethorpe resources include 1,185 MW of must-run nuclear capacity and
1,500 MW of dispatchable baseload fossil capacity in Georgia at Wansley
Units 1 and 2 and Scherer Units 1 and 2. It also has 636 MW of dispatchable
pumped hydro capacity at the new Rocky Mountain plant and contracts for
baseload and peaking power with Georgia Power and a 300-MW independent
power project at Hartwell, owned jointly by American National Power and
Destec.
   Under the arrangement, Enron essentially will take over the marketing in
the region of Oglethorpe's excess, bearing the risks of a flat market as
well as the potential gains from a strong market. Its strategy proved
profitable in the early part of January when the Southeast was hit with
several days of subfreezing weather.
   Oglethorpe will continue to operate its system and control area and
carry out dispatching. But Enron will also be present in the Oglethorpe
control center and will have a say in decisions affecting energy based on
provisions in the contract.
   Oglethorpe officials said the Enron contract contains no provisions for
a follow-up deal after April 30.
    But the company sees the arrangement as one possible model for future
operations. A second alternative would be an energy pool operated by
Oglethorpe itself, which was proposed in late 1995 and is now in
preparation.
   Officials at Cooperative Power Inc., made up of six large Oglethorpe
members, said they are still on track to contract with a marketer
themselves to handle their power trading and procurement after April 30.
   Because of the Enron arrangement and other developments at Ogelthorpe,
including December's restructuring announcement, Georgia Power is delaying
a request for proposals for power purchases in 2000. The RFPs had been
scheduled to go out in early January.
   Georgia Power had told the state Public Service Commission in October
that it planned to seek bids for up to 600 MW of peaking and intermediate
supplies using both traditional and options contracts.
   But since the company currently has contracts to sell 750 MW of power to
Oglethorpe, which could be canceled over the next three years, it has
decided to review its future needs because of the Oglethorpe
restructuring.
   Oglethorpe itself is still holding in suspension a 1993 RFP for 600 MW
of 1999 peaking power while it works out its future plans and power needs
under the restructuring.

COLDEST WEATHER IN SIX YEARS CAUSES RECORD PEAKS THROUGHOUT FLORIDA

While snow blanketed much of the East Coast of the U.S., Florida felt the
coldest weather in more than six years, as high demand set new winter and
all-time peak records throughout the state.
   The state's three largest utilities all set new all-time record peaks,
as temperatures dropped nearly to 20F in much of the state on Jan. 9. The
primary source of heating in Florida is electric, which puts an additional
stress on the system. Still, state-wide reserve capacity was about 3,800 MW
on Jan. 9, according to Tom Hallam, staff engineer of the Florida Electric
Utility Coordinating Group.
   Tampa Electric, which is normally the chief supplier of purchase power,
hit a new all-time peak of 3,526 MW about 7:11 a.m. on Jan. 9. A spokesman
said TECO had no reserve capacity and had to crank up its rarely used
combustion turbine units in order to meet demand. TECO had expected a low
of about 31 degrees and a demand of about 3,400 MW, which would have
exceeded the previous all-time peak of 3,339 MW set on Feb. 9, 1995.
   Florida Power broke records on both Jan. 8, when it hit 8,086 MW, and
again on Jan. 9, when demand soared to about 8,500 MW, a spokesman said. To
meet demand, Florida Power exercised about 600 MW of residential load
control and cranked up all but one of its small combustion turbine units.
It did not resort to interrupting its large industrial and commercial
customers, which would have given it another 700 MW, a spokesman said.
   Florida Power & Light hit a new all-time demand record of about 17,300
MW on the morning of Jan. 9, which easily exceeded the previous record of
16,563 MW set on Feb. 9, 1995, a spokesman said. At the time, about 34,000
or 1% of its customers were out of service due to scattered distribution
problems. To meet demand, FP&L used about 300 MW of commercial load
control, but was not forced to use the 500 MW of residential load control
it had available.
   The Orlando Utilities Commission broke all-time peak records on both
Jan. 8, when demand reached 893 MW at about 7:30 am., and Jan. 9, when the
peak was 917 MW at about 7 a.m. OUC operates a power pool for itself, the
Florida Municipal Power Agency, the Lakeland Electric & Water Dept.,
Kissimmee Utility Authority and the city of St. Cloud. An OUC spokesman
said the pool set a record of 2,272 MW on Jan. 8, then broke that record on
Jan. 9 at 2,410 MW.
   In North Florida, the Jacksonville Electric Authority broke its previous
all-time peak of 2,247 MW, which was also set on Feb. 9, 1995, on Jan. 8,
when demand hit 2,339 MW. On Jan. 9, JEA came within 5 MW of breaking that
record, a spokesman said. Gulf Power set a new winter peak of 1,821 MW on
Jan. 8, beating its previous winter peak of 1,821 MW on Dec. 23, 1989.

REGIONAL STATE-BY-STATE SCORECARD OF ELECTRIC INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING

    Over the last three months, restructuring debates have heated up in
most parts of the country, with 30 states now reporting some sort of
activity. The California Public Utilities Commission came out with a major
compromise plan in late December, several New England states are asking
their utilities to file restructuring plans in the coming six months, and
regulators have issued initial restructuring guidelines in several
Midwestern states. Restructuring debates have even begun in a few Southern
states, even though lower power prices in the region kept activity at a
minimum. The following is a state-by-state survey of restructuring activity
in the Southeast. All dates are 1995 unless otherwise noted.

ARKANSAS
In early 1995, a bill was introduced in the state Legislature that would
allow large industrial users to switch retail suppliers under certain
conditions. But the bill was quickly withdrawn without a major debate.
State regulators say they expect to start a restructuring proceeding in
1996, but so far the Public Service Commission has issued no initial
notice.

FLORIDA
The state Legislature has created a special subcommittee to investigate
competition in the electric industry. The panel will gather information and
could make legislative proposals in 1996.

GEORGIA
The Public Service Commission said it will hold an investigation in 1996
on whether the state's current territorial franchise system needs to be
adapted to the more competitive electric industry environment. The current
system lets large users choose among supply options when adding new load
but gives no freedom of choice to smaller customers.
In December, a bill was introduced in the state Legislature that would
force utilities to provide retail wheeling services to all customers and
give customers wide rights to switch retail suppliers without penalty. The
bill contains no stranded investment provisions and is strongly opposed by
utilities.

LOUISIANA
A group of industrial users proposed in May that the city of New Orleans
consider an open-access approach, with several suppliers competing for
retail users using the existing New Orleans Public Service distribution
system. But the plan got a cold reception from the City Council, and
planned hearings on competition issues have been postponed indefinitely.

MARYLAND
The Public Service Commission is carrying out a proceeding on competition
(Case No. 8678). In comments filed in January, industrial users have
favored full retail competition, while utilities have backed some
deregulation of generation and limited retail competition tied to stranded
investment. The PSC final report issued Aug. 18 rejected the use of retail
wheeling, saying that the relatively low power rates in the state meant
Maryland did not need ``dramatic fixes'' at this time.

NORTH CAROLINA
In February, industrials asked the Utilities Commission to begin an
investigation into retail competition. After receiving generally negative
comments from utilities, the commission decided on July 21 not to implement
retail wheeling at this time (Doc. No. E-100, Sub. 77). It said wheeling
presented too many legal uncertainties and that it preferred to wait and
see what other states did. It asked parties to offer further comments on
the issue.
   In October, large industrials warned that the go-slow approach would put
the state at a competitive disadvantage and called on the commission to
sponsor a new round of public meetings on retail competition in early
1996.

OKLAHOMA
In June, the Legislature set up a 14-member task force to review all
aspects of the electric industry in the state. It is not clear how much the
group will deal with competition issues.

SOUTH CAROLINA
In July, the Public Service Commission turned down a request from
industrials to initiate a formal review of retail wheeling. Instead, the
PSC staff will carry out a low-key study of the issue.

TEXAS
A major bill passed by the Texas Legislature in late May ordered various
changes in the operation of the state's wholesale market. But due to a
political stand-off, the bill did not change the status quo on retail
wheeling issues. A proposal for a retail wheeling pilot was dropped from
the bill, as were various anti-retail wheeling provisions. Instead, the
Legislature asked state regulators to conduct studies on key issues. Since
then, industrials have begun to organize a wider coalition in support of
retail competition and hope to apply greater political pressure in the 1997
legislative session.
   The Texas Public Utility Commission in October opened a general
restructuring proceeding (Docket No. 15000) to make recommendations to the
Legislature by 1997 on competition and stranded investment issues. Parties
were asked to comment on specific unbundling and stranded cost concepts
floated by commission members.
   The PUC also is asking for comment by January 1996 on a separate
transmission rule. It would set up a regional postage stamp pricing system
for use of the state grid and also bring in an independent system operator
to manage the system.

VIRGINIA
In September, the Virginia State Corporation Commission announced it was
opening a formal review of electric industry competition and restructuring
issues. It said its staff would issue a report on March 31, 1996, making
policy recommendations. After a 60-day public comment period, the SCC will
make final decisions.
  In its notice, the commission said its staff had already held informal
talks with key parties and that even though Virginia already had low
electric prices, there could be improvement through increased competition.
In comments submitted to the SCC in December, Virginia Power urged a
go-slow approach to retail competition and said the commission should
concentrate first on alternative ratemaking for utilities.

AEP DROPS NAMES OF OPERATING UNITS; ALL CALLED AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER

After decades of operation, Kentucky Power, Appalachian Power, Wheeling
Power and Kingsport Power are no more. In early January, the four utilities
adopted the name of their parent company, American Electric Power.
   The change--AEP's three other subsidiaries outside the Southeast were
affected as well--is part of AEP's ``New Directions Next Steps'' program to
prepare for competition and deregulation in the utility industry by trading
on its ``brand name'' recognition. AEP's other units are Columbus Southern
Power, Indiana Michigan Power and Ohio Power.
   All seven operating companies are now known as one company: American
Electric Power. From now on, the AEP logo will be emblazoned on company
facilities, vehicles and communications with customers. For the first time,
AEP's corporate headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, will bear a large ``AEP''
logo atop the building.
   Also this month, individual company publications are being consolidated
into one publication that will have a tabloid newspaper format.
   ``We've always been AEP, a world-class energy company dedicated to
hometown service, and our employees have worked under a variety of company
names in the past,'' said AEP chairman Linn Draper. ``Using AEP as our name
throughout the company is a sign that all of these individuals have joined
a single team to find ways to serve our customers even better.
   ``We do not need to change legal, financial, rate or regulatory
relationships as the result of the new one-company strategy,'' continued
Draper, ``but we expect our customers will see many benefits and
efficiencies from this change in days to come.''
   Not everyone within AEP was an enthusiastic supporter of the name change
last summer when Draper first disclosed plans to phase out operating
company identities. Over the years, fierce loyalties and friendly
competitions had developed within the seven subsidiaries.
   In the end, change won out as it is doing more frequently these days in
the utility industry.
   In keeping with its one-company philosophy, AEP has named new AEP
presidents as top statewide contacts for customer groups, legislators and
regulators. Effective Jan. 1, new state presidents include Timothy Moser,
Kentucky; Dana Waldo, West Virginia; and Daniel Carson, Virginia and
Tennessee.
   The state presidents will discuss what AEP believes are the benefits of
competition in the electric power industry with the company's customers,
regulators and legislators. They are expected to ``work diligently to build
a consensus on industry restructuring,'' Draper said.

VIRGINIA POWER TO CUT STAFF BY 30%; MAY PUT TWO 882-MW UNITS IN RESERVE

Virginia Power said Jan. 8 that its fossil and hydro business unit is in
the final stages of a far-reaching restructuring and downsizing effort
aimed at optimizing the cost-competitiveness of the utility's hydroelectric
facilities and plants fired by coal, oil and gas.
   Among other things, Virginia Power said, the fossil and hydro unit plans
to reduce by about 30% the number of salaried and hourly employees and to
``remission'' two large oil-fired plants from regular to emergency-only
use. These and other moves, it said, should save the utility $55 million to
$65 million a year and help maintain the utility's position as one of the
lowest-cost generators in its region.
   In a series of announcements over the past several months, the most
recent of which was Jan. 8, the fossil and hydro unit has said it will trim
its salaried and hourly payroll by a total of 537 positions by early March.
That will leave the unit with 1,254 employees.
   The utility said reductions are part of a ``comprehensive redesign
effort'' that grew out of the utility's Vision 2000 strategic planning
process.
   Last year, teams composed of fossil and hydro unit employees examined
potential efficiency and cost-cutting measures. In addition to recommending
the staffing reductions, the teams had urged that two 882-MW oil-fired
plants that have been providing intermediate and peaking capacity since the
mid-1970s--Possum Point Unit 5 and Yorktown Unit--should be placed in
emergency reserve, and be run four weeks each peak season.

SOUTH CAROLINA ALLOWS SCE&G TO SHIFT DEPRECIATION FROM T&D TO NUCLEAR
ASSETS

The South Carolina Public Service Commission has decided to allow South
Carolina Electric & Gas to transfer nearly $257 million in depreciation
reserves from its transmission and distribution assets to its nuclear
generation assets as part of a rate case (Docket No. 95-1000-E).
   The move has angered non-utility generators, industrials, and the
state's Dept. of Consumer Affairs, who claimed that the ruling will give
SCE&G--already one of the lowest-cost generators in the Southeast--an
unfair competitive advantage over other generators after deregulation, and
will increase the cost of accessing SCE&G's T&D system.
   The PSC also granted a 7.34%, $67.5-million rate hike for the utility.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, deputy consumer advocate at the state Dept. of
Consumer Affairs (DCA), explained that the depreciation-reserve shift will
result in a lower ``book value'' for SCE&G's two-thirds stake in the 900-MW
V.C. Summer nuclear plant, and a higher book value for the utility's T&D
assets.
   That, Coombs continued, will have the effect of shifting SCE&G's costs
away from its generation sector, which is likely to face increasing
competition as deregulation takes hold, to its T&D sector, which is likely
to remain a monopoly.
   In the increasingly competitive generation market, she said, other
generators and power marketers will be forced to compete with the
artificially lower generation costs SCE&G will be able to offer thanks to
the depreciation-reserve shift. Generators and marketers also will be
forced to pay artificially higher costs to wheel power across SCE&G lines
because those costs are based in part on the book value of its T&D assets.
   An irony in the matter, Coombs said, is that SCE&G already was unusually
well-positioned for generation competition even before it secured the PSC's
approval for the depreciation-reserve shift. ``Its rates are the lowest of
any investor-owned utility in South Carolina,'' she said, ``and are among
the lowest in the Southeast, which as a whole has the second-lowest rates
of any region in the country.''
   Coombs said the DCA will ask the PSC to reconsider its ruling, and added
that if the commission fails to do so, her agency is likely to file a legal
challenge in state court, asserting the depreciation reserve transfer
violates South Carolina law.
   The DCA's concerns were echoed by Craig Roach, a principal with Boston
Pacific Co. Inc. of Washington, D.C., who represents the Carolina
Competitive Energy Producers, a NUG group. ``The whole point of
unbundling,'' he said, ``is to reveal the true cost of generation,'' and
any effort to artificially lower the cost of generation is ``clearly
anti-competitive.''
   Roach added, however, that while he wishes the DCA well in its effort to
reverse the PSC's ruling, the group he represents cannot commit the
financial resources that would be involved in joining the fray. ``There are
too many battles to fight,'' he said.
   Also expressing concern about the depreciation-reserve shift was Arthur
Fusco, a Columbia, S.C., attorney who represents the South Carolina Energy
Users Committee (SCEUC), a 57-member industrial group that was been
pressing state regulators to accelerate deregulation and retail wheeling.
   Fusco said the depreciation reserve transfer would increase the wheeling
costs industrials would pay if, once retail competition arrives, they were
to buy their electricity requirements from a utility other than SCE&G.
   He said SCEUC also will urge the PSC to reconsider the magnitude of the
rate increase itself, which he said was ``way too high,'' in part because
the commission will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of return on common
equity--a full percentage point higher than it had been earning.
   SCE&G general counsel Belton Ziegler defended the PSC's ruling, however,
and dismissed assertions that the transfer is anti-competitive. He said the
ruling will help his utility ``prepare for competition.''
   Among other things, Ziegler said the reserve shift is a necessary
preemptive step to ensure that any large retail customers that leave the
utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had developed to
serve them. Without the shift, he said, residential and small-commercial
customers would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the utility's stranded
investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   He continued, ``If you look at the natural gas industry, the benefits of
deregulation went for the most part to large customers who could move off
the system'' and avoid, as much as possible, the responsibility for paying
off the investments their old gas companies had made to serve them.
   ``We are telling industrials that if they leave as generation customers
they still will have to pay [for the nuclear assets SCE&G developed for
them] as transmission and distribution customers.''

`BLIZZARD OF '96', WHILE DUMPING MUCH SNOW, CAUSES RELATIVELY FEW OUTAGES

Given the magnitude of the snowstorm that swept through the northern tier
of the Southeast on Jan. 6 and 7, utilities in the region fared relatively
well, reporting customer outages that--taken together--ran only into the
tens of thousands.
   American Electric Power, which serves portions of Virginia and West
Virginia under what used to be called Appalachian Power Co. (see story on
its name changes this issue), said four of its smaller transmission lines
in the Virginias--one 138-kV line and three 69-kV lines--lost service
during the storm, but no customers were affected because power was
automatically rerouted through other lines.
   A total of about 15,000 customers elsewhere on the AEP system in
Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky lost power for a time
because of downed distribution lines, a spokesman said. Power was restored
to most within hours.
   Virginia Power, meanwhile, said as many as 30,000 customers lost power
during the storm, including 2,400 mostly commercial customers in downtown
Norfolk midday Sunday, Jan. 7, due to a conduit fault in an underground
11-kV circuit.
   A spokesman said the utility quickly replaced some 3,000 linear feet of
conduit so it could restore service to all but a few customers by early
Monday. The cause of the fault is still under investigation.
   The bulk of the outages on the Virginia Power system, however, were in
the Northern Neck and Gloucester area south of Washington, D.C., and on the
western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
   Duke Power, in turn, said that as many as 34,000--or about 2%--of its
1.7 million North and South Carolina customers were without power at the
same time during the storm, mostly because of ice-related distribution-line
problems in and near Charlotte, N.C., and Greenville and Clemson, S.C.
   About 8,000 customers remained cut off Monday morning, a spokesman said,
but service was restored to most of them later that day.
   Carolina Power & Light, whose North and South Carolina service
territories experienced a mix of snow, sleet and rain, said it experienced
only one significant outage--affecting about 5,000 customers in the
Sanford, N.C., area, south of Raleigh.
   And Monongahela Power, whose West Virginia service territory was
blanketed with two feet of snow, said only a few dozen customers lost power
during the storm. A spokeswoman noted that while cold temperatures
increased residential demand over the weekend and on Monday, demand from
industrial and commercial customers was off sharply as businesses closed
because of the snow.

ENERGY INITIATIVES WINS FIRST ROUND ON FIRM CAPACITY PAYMENTS IN FLORIDA

Lake Cogen, a 112-MW project developed by Energy Initiatives, won a partial
summary judgment Jan. 4 in a case filed against Florida Power in state
circuit court in Lake County (No. 94354 CA-01, Division 8).
   The case revolves around whether firm capacity payments should be made
based on a model used by Florida Power, or a separate method the developers
of the gas-fired cogeneration facility said was specified in the contract.
Florida Power pays NUGs both capacity and energy payments when the
theoretically avoided generating unit would operate, but only as-available
or energy payments if the avoided unit would have been off-line.
   Florida Power claimed the theoretically avoided 500-MW pulverized coal
plant equipped with a scrubber, which was used to determine capacity and
energy payments, would be used by the utility based on four criteria to
determine when the plant would be dispatched on an economic basis. The four
parameters were the cost of variable operations and maintenance, the price
of coal, the heat rate of the unit, and a fuel multiplier of 1.
   In its motion, Lake Cogen contended other factors, such as environmental
compliance, should be used in determining economic dispatchability of a
generating unit. It said an actual, operating plant should be used for
comparison, namely Florida Power's coal-fired Crystal River units Nos.
1-2.
   Judge Don Briggs ruled the parameters for dispatchability should be
based on a real unit and not only the four Florida Power was using. He
ordered that a more accurate model be developed to determine how much Lake
Cogen should be paid. That cost information will be compared to actual
payments, which could be used to determine an award at a later date,
assuming the model shows Lake Cogen was underpaid. A schedule for further
proceedings had not be set.
   Fama confirmed that two other NUGs, Pasco Cogen and Orlando Cogen, have
similar court actions pending.
   Lake Cogen is located in Umatilla, Fla., and sells steam to Golden Gem
Growers. Partners in the project along with Energy Initiatives are Lake
Investment Holdings and NCP Lake Power Inc.

PANDA ENERGY, FLORIDA POWER CONTINUE FIGHT OVER PROJECT IN POLK COUNTY

Panda Energy and Florida Power have traded lawsuits in a dispute over
Panda's proposed project in Polk County.
   Panda was allowed to voluntarily withdraw without prejudice a
$345-million federal suit it had filed against Florida Power (SPR, 1l Aug
'95, 1), but Florida Power has since filed suit against Panda. In addition,
the state Public Service Commission denied two requests made by Panda in a
related action.
   The anti-trust suit Panda withdrew in U.S. District Court for the Middle
District of Florida, Tampa Division (Case No. 95-992-CIV-T-24 C), alleged
Florida Power unfairly interfered with its construction of a cogeneration
plant which was to have supplied Florida Power with 74.9 MW of firm power
under a standard offer contract.
   Panda's general counsel Bill Nordlund said the withdrawal was a
strategic move, ``and we still plan to prosecute this matter and move
forward on it.'' He would not specify when or in what venue.
   The countersuit filed by Florida Power at the end of December sought
declaratory judgments answering the allegations included in Panda's suit,
in case Panda refiled the case, according to Florida Power attorney Jim
Fama (95-2145-CIV-T-25-B).
   Florida Power asked the court to rule that:
Panda did not have a superior legal right to negotiate for a natural gas
transmission contract with the city of Lakeland, and that the utility did
not interfere with Panda's rights with the city;
  -- Panda is not entitled to a standard-offer contract if it builds a unit
larger than 75 MW;
  -- Panda is not entitled to payments under a standard-offer contract
beyond December 2016; and
  -- Panda has breached its contract by failing to begin construction on
the unit.
   The suit also sought relief from the court.
   On Jan. 3, the PSC refused to reconsider a decision the PSC made on Dec.
5, which said the PSC did have jurisdiction over standard-offer contracts
and the Florida Power/Panda dispute. It also refused to grant Panda a
90-day extension beyond Jan. 5 to file testimony in that case (Docket No.
950110-EI). As a result, a hearing at the PSC was scheduled for Feb. 19, a
staff recommendation was due April 18, and the commission was scheduled to
vote on April 30.

NCEMPA-1 TO USE NEW METERING EQUIPMENT TO EASE ENTRY INTO WHOLESALE MARKET

North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1 said it is gearing up to enter
the Southeast wholesale power market over the next few months, and is
installing new wholesale delivery point metering equipment that will enable
it to predict with considerable accuracy how much surplus non-firm energy
it has to sell.
   NCMPA-1, part of Raleigh-based ElectriCities of North Carolina Inc.,
arranges wholesale power for 19 municipal utilities in the western part of
the state, including larger munis like those in High Point and Gastonia and
smaller ones like those in Lincolnton, Cherryville and Pineville.
   Through plant co-ownership and exchange agreements it signed with Duke
Power more than a decade ago, the agency is entitled to 850 MW from Duke's
2,200-MW Catawba nuclear power station in Clover, S.C. The investor-owned
utility agreed to buy back a significant portion of NCMPA-1's entitlement
initially, then decreasing amounts until the buy-back period ends around
the turn of the century.
   In part because Duke also agreed to buy back--at a relatively low
price--any surplus energy NCMPA-1 may have, and because of a
first-right-of-refusal clause that enabled Duke to match any offer another
potential buyer might make for that surplus, the agency made no real effort
in the 1980s and first half of the 1990s to market its surplus to others.
   Recently, however, NCMPA-1 and Duke reached an agreement that resolves
the first-right-of-refusal issue, and the agency decided to install special
metering equipment at key wholesale delivery points to its member munis to
provide it with real-time information about muni demand.
   That data also will enable NCMPA-1 to predict how much surplus energy it
will have available for sale, said Woody Adams, NCMPA-1's power-supply
manager.
   Adams told Southeast Power Report that while his agency always has had
the right to sell surplus energy, ``we didn't havethe ability to know on a
timely basis how much surplus energy we had'' available for sale.
   He predicted that in 1996 NCMPA-1 will have at least 500 GWh and
possibly as much as 600 GWh of surplus energy for sale either through the
Automated Interchange Matching System (AIMS) or through bilateral deals,
and that that amount would grow to at least 1,000 GWh by 2000.
   ``The surplus will be available primarily in the off-peak hours,'' Adams
said, with more--including, perhaps, some peak-hour energy--available in
non-summer months, but at least some available at night and on weekends all
12 months of the year. He said summer-peaking NCMPA-1 sees particular
promise in ``seasonal diversity'' deals with winter-peaking entities to its
north and west, as well as daily or even seasonal ``energy swaps.''
   The cost of producing the energy in question, he noted, is
``characteristic of typical generation costs for a well-run nuclear unit,''
but he declined to provide specifics. Duke is generally considered to be
one of the nation's premier operators of nuclear facilities.
   ``What we intend to do initially,'' Adams said, ``is to market the
surplus energy on AIMS'' beginning later this winter, ``as well as to enter
into exchange agreements with power marketers and with utilities that are
either directly connected to Duke or that have ready access'' to the
investor-owned utility.
   Duke would have ``as much right as anyone'' to buy power through AIMS,
he said, adding that NCMPA-1 already has signed exchange agreements with
several marketers, including Citizens Lehman Power, Enron Power Marketing,
and LG&E Power Marketing.
   The major advantages of participating in the market, Adams said, ``will
be to give us the contacts and experience we'll need to be active in those
markets as they evolve.''
   The impact of surplus energy sales on NCMPA-1's balance sheet, ``while
significant, will not be a make-or-break thing for us. We see it more as an
initial step toward becoming competitive in deregulated power markets,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, NCMPA-1 also is installing equipment to monitor the loads of
``well over 50'' of its munis' largest retail customers. That equipment,
said Mark Otersen, the agency's supervisor of demand-side operations, will
let NCMPA-1 gather information on customer demand and chart customer load
``shapes''--or patterns of demand.
   That load-shape data, in turn, should help NCMPA-1 design new
demand-side management-related rates for industries with common load
shapes, and help its member munis convince large energy users of the
benefits of using such rates, Otersen said.
   He noted that relatively few of the large retail customers served by
munis in western North Carolina currently participate in load-management
programs that provide incentives to those who agree to let their utility
curtail or interrupt power during peak periods, or who agree to run
peak-shaving standby generators.

LG&E POWER MARKETING SEEKS TO BROKER POWER SALES AND PURCHASES BY TVA

LG&E Power Marketing Inc. (LPM) has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to approve changes in its accounting practices to cover a
contract under which the marketer will broker power sales and purchases by
the Tennessee Valley Authority and assign all gains and losses to its
affiliate Louisville Gas & Electric.
   In a Dec. 15 filing to FERC, LPM said that it was about to enter into an
interchange agreement with TVA under which it would sell energy to TVA and
buy energy for resale to third parties (Doc. No. ER94-1188-000).
   While it will take title to energy received from TVA, it will pass all
benefits from the transactions on to LG&E, thereby maintaining its broker
status in the deals.
   LPM officials said they already perform this non-exclusive brokering
function for LG&E with other energy sellers based on existing general
arrangements with LG&E on file at FERC.
   In the TVA case, however, the two parties will change a system under
which the marketer pays a fee to LG&E for dispatching and transmission
services. Instead of a straight fee, LPM will use the dispatching fee as a
``true up'' mechanism to insure that LG&E receives the full benefit of any
deal involving TVA energy.
   It asked FERC to approve this new arrangement now so that questions
about accounting procedures will not arise later which might hinder LPM's
marketer status and ability to use market-based pricing under FERC
regulations.
   In its filing, LPM also asserted that it was entitled to enter an
interchange agreement with TVA despite a Congressional ban on TVA sales
outside its own territory, because its affiliated franchise, LG&E, was
grandfathered under the 1957 TVA ``fence'' law.
   It also noted that its arrangement with LG&E was not exclusive since any
of its competitors with similar rights could carry out the same services
for LG&E. It said the deal did not in any way increase its market power or
result in undue discrimination or preference and would not be detrimental
to LG&E ratepayers.
   FERC asked for comment by Jan. 12. It appears likely that some utilities
in the region may raise questions about the ``fence issue.''
   Already, in September, when the issue of an interchange between LPM and
TVA first arose, members of Congress asked for an explanation of its legal
aspects. At that time, TVA sent a letter to Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-NC)
assuring him that the arrangement could be done under current fence rules
(SPR, 22 Sept '95, 1).
   At the same time, industry sources said it is possible TVA will attempt
to attach a last-minute amendment to the current budget bill to create a
more explicit permission to allow such interchanges with affiliates of the
14 grandfathered utilities.
   Last summer, TVA publicly pulled back from a plan to introduce
legislation to bring down the fence, and it remains to be seen if it now
will take a piecemeal approach, starting with energy sales to marketers and
energy pools which have immediate applications in the region.

WTU TO SUPPLY CO-OP WITH 11.7 MW, INCLUDING NEW COTTON SPINNING PLANT

Central and South West unit West Texas Utilities has signed a 10-year deal
to supply a total of 11.7-MW to Midwest Electric Cooperative of Roby,
Texas.
   The pact takes effect in two stages. On Sept. 1, 1997, WTU will begin
supplying 5 MW to Midwest to serve the Lortex Industries cotton spinning
plant in Snyder, Texas. The plant represents new load and the entry of a
new industry to that part of Texas.
   On June 1, 1998, it will begin supplying another 6.7 MW. That capacity
has been supplied by TU Electric.
   The contract also has an extended terms provision, meaning that WTU also
will supply any load growth that Midwest experiences at the Lortex
facility.
   WTU said the pact would have a non-fuel revenue impact of $1.4 million
annually when fully implemented. To supply Midwest, WTU will build 39 miles
of 69-kV line and two substations.
   Midwest serves 5,640 members in 10 Texas counties.

LG&E AND LG&E MARKETER MAKE DEAL
WITH OHIO ED SWAPPING COAL FOR POWER

An unusual agreement is in the works among Louisville Gas & Electric, LG&E
Power Marketing and Ohio Edison under which LG&E would supply high-sulfur
coal to Ohio Ed and LPM would receive 300 MW of electricity for one year
from Ohio Ed's Burger power plant.
   An Ohio Ed spokesman confirmed that negotiations are under way but said
a final agreement has not been reached. An LPM spokeswoman said she could
not comment on the proposed arrangement until it is finalized.
   A source familiar with the pending deal said the talks are being
governed by ``very strict confidentiality agreements.'' Apparently, here is
how the transaction would work: LG&E would supply up to 1 million tons of
high-sulfur coal, reportedly from West Virginia, this year to the Burger
plant, located at Shadyside, Ohio.
   In return, LPM would have access to 300 MW of electricity from Burger to
supply its own customers.
   Another Ohio Ed spokesman said he could not comment on the proposed bulk
power agreement because of the ``increasingly competitive'' bulk power
market and electric utility industry.
   The source told The McGraw-Hill Companies' Power Markets Week that such
arrangements may become more commonplace as competition and deregulation
come to the utility industry. ``With a dramatically changing industry such
as the power production industry, you're going to see unusual agreements
more and more,'' she said.
   LPM has been very aggressive since its formation last August. It and
LG&E are subsidiaries of LG&E Energy Corp.

NYMEX LOOKS TO TVA, SOUTHERN COMPANY
AS POSSIBLE FUTURES CONTRACT SITES

With its two proposed electricity futures contracts on track to be
effective this spring, the New York Mercantile Exchange is considering
delivery points in the East to launch further contracts. Among the systems
under consideration in the Southeast are the Tennessee Valley Authority and
the Southern Company system.
   Patrick Thompson, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, last
week predicted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will act on the
exchange's two proposed electricity futures contracts before the end of the
month, which could allow trading to begin by the end of March or early in
the second quarter of this year.
   NYMEX filed supplemental information on its proposed futures contracts
with the CFTC late last month. The material, responding to commission
inquiries concerning the deliverability of the commodity and potential
regulation of electricity futures by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, was filed under a claim of confidentiality and was not made
publicly available.
   The confidential filing cleared the way for CFTC staff to begin
preparing a memorandum for consideration by the commission. The four
sitting commissioners likely will begin considering whether to approve the
contracts later this month, according to a CFTC source.
   Assuming the supplemental filing from NYMEX answers all the questions
raised by the CFTC staff, the memorandum now being drafted could be sent to
the commission within two weeks, the CFTC source said.
   ``I'm really confident now that the CFTC has had all of its questions
answered--both technical and regulatory,'' NYMEX's Thompson said in a
telephone interview last week. ``I expect the approval process to conclude
very quickly.''
   NYMEX is expected to launch both contracts at the same time. The two
contracts are virtually identical, except for the physical delivery points
at the Palo Verde nuclear station switchyard and the California/Oregon
border intertie. The exchange plans to let the markets decide whether one
or both futures contracts will be sustained in the long term.
   NYMEX's advisory group is also considering the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection and American Electric Power's grid as
potential delivery points for further futures contracts in the East.

GREENVILLE, N.C., MUNI USES COINCIDENT
PEAK RATES TO CUT INDUSTRIAL COSTS

Officials of the Greenville Utilities Commission in North Carolina said
that coincident-peak-based rates have not only allowed the muni's existing
industrial customers to cut electric bills, but are helping the muni to
lure new business to the city.
   John Chaffee, executive director of the Pitt County Development
Commission, said industrials that are taking full advantage of the CP rates
pay no more--and sometimes less--than they would for power from neighboring
investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives that serve areas around
Greenville.
   GUC buys all its wholesale power from the North Carolina Eastern
Municipal Power Agency, which in turn buys most of its power from Carolina
Power & Light.
   Because a significant portion of NCEMPA's and the muni's wholesale power
costs is based on their demand during CP&L's highest systemwide demand hour
each month, the muni agency and Greenville have been working hard to
minimize their monthly peaks through, among other things, aggressive
residential load control programs, and programs to help industrials install
peak-shaving generation.
   GUC general manager Roger Jones said the Greenville muni also in
mid-1994 replaced its traditional industrial rate schedule with a new menu
of CP-only rates that all customers with a demand of 750 kW or more must
choose from.
   The GUC typically notifies its industrial customers by automated signal
when it expects a potential coincident-peak period to be approaching; at
that point, the rate agreement says, the customer ``may utilize any means
deemed suitable to reduce its coincident peak demand,'' including, for
instance, temporary production cuts and/or the use of muni-approved
peak-shaving generators.
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW-plus customers, who also include some
large commercial and institutional accounts, together comprise about
one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use. The CP rates have encouraged
them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20% from what it typically
would have been without the coincident-peak rates.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varies widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%.
   For example, a large Proctor & Gamble manufacturing plant in Greenville
that typically demands about 8 MW reduces its demand to between 1 and 1.5
MW during coincident peaks, Jones noted, saving both P&G and the muni
thousands of dollars in monthly power costs.
   Chaffee said P&G ``basically shuts down production [during forecasted CP
hours] to achieve the maximum possible savings.'' To make the best use of
its down time, he noted, the manufacturer performs required maintenance on
its production and other equipment.
   Chaffee gave as an example the new automobile parts plant that Japan's
ASMO Co. Ltd. in 1994 developed--and in 1995 expanded--in Greenville. The
combined $50-million facility demands about 2.5 MW.
   ``An important issue for ASMO in deciding where to site the [initial]
plant was power costs,'' he said. ``We were able to demonstrate that by
utilizing Greenville's CP rate and installing [a 1-MW peak-shaving
generator to further reduce CP demand] that they would be paying rates
competitive with'' industrial rates offered by Duke Power and other
low-cost, investor-owned utilities in the Southeast.
   Chaffee added, finally, that in his view the CP has been a significant
factor in enabling Greenville to draw increasing numbers of new industries.
He noted that while industrial firms announced $20 million in new
investments in the city in 1992 and $33 million the year after that,
industrial investment jumped to $43 million in 1994 and $55 million in
1995--the first two years the CP rates were mandated.

TECO ROE CAPPED AT 12.5% IN AGREEMENT
TIED TO 260-MW COAL GASIFICATION PLANT

The Florida Public Service Commission voted Jan. 3 to cap the 1996 rate of
return on equity for Tampa Electric at 12.5% and to determine at a future
time how over-earnings might be distributed (Docket No. 950379-EI).
   The action, coming after TECO earned about $45 million more than its
allowed ROE in 1995, will forestall a rate case that would have been filed
in 1996 to pay for a new generating unit.
   In an earlier stipulation with staff, TECO's 1995 earnings were capped
at 12.75% and about $45 million of over-earnings will be deferred until
1997, after TECO's new $550-million, 260-MW integrated coal gasification
combined cycle plant which is in Polk County goes on-line in late 1996
(SPR, 19 May '95, 16). TECO's actual ROE for 1995 was expected to be about
16%.
   The deal between staff and TECO effectively replaced negotiations the
utility was conducting with the Office of the Public Counsel, which
represents ratepayers at the Florida Public Service Commission, according
to OPC attorney Roger Howe (SPR, 31 Dec '95, 11).
   The PSC's action, which was the result of last-minute negotiations
between staff and TECO on 1996 earnings, could mean that any excess
revenues could be used for the plant, a refund, to offset regulatory
assets, or for depreciation in 1997 or later. The PSC will likely make a
decision on disposition of 1996 excesses sometime in early 1997, according
to Tim Devlin of the PSC's Auditing and Finance Division.
   Under the arrangement for 1996, TECO will have an ROE range of 11.5% to
13.5%. However, all of the earnings over 11.5% will be split, which
effectively caps earnings at 12.5%. TECO estimated it will earn about
13.27% in 1996.
   The Polk unit will go into rate base in late 1996 and based on TECO's
earnings projections, which are considered conservative, it will still earn
in excess of its allowed ROE. The 1995 excess carried forward was also
expected to cover the additional cost of the new unit through 1997 and,
possibly, beyond.
   Howe said that, because interest rates were expected to further decline
during the next few years, it was likely the PSC would reduce TECO's
allowed ROE for 1997, which could mean additional excess earnings in that
year, despite the new unit.

NEW GEORGIA POWER RESIDENTIAL DSM
PROGRAM SHIFTS CONTROL TO CUSTOMERS

Georgia Power has proposed to state regulators a new residential load
control program which it says will create 156 MW of savings over 10 years.
   Under the plan, customers would buy the control equipment from Georgia
Power at discounted prices. While this approach is expected to limit
participation to about 10% of all homes, it will only cost the utility a
$20.1-million investment during the 10-year period, meeting the new state
policy limiting DSM spending.
   Under the proposal, submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission
in December, Georgia Power will give its residential users a choice of
three approaches to carry out load control.
   The most sophisticated will be a home control system based on Scientific
Atlanta's ``SuperStat'' thermostat, which will adjust home power use in
response to a ``critical price signal'' from the utility.
   The second approach would use the SuperStat equipment to cycle air
conditioners and other appliances at different times of day based on
prearranged peak and off-peak demand periods. And the third approach will
be to simply offer time-of-use rates to customers with conventional
thermostat control equipment and encourage them to take advantage of price
differentials by voluntarily setting controls.
   Georgia Power said it expects 11,000 customers to actively participate
in this third approach over ten years with a potential savings of 33 MW.
The three programs together would involve about 81,000 homes after 10
years, representing about an 11.2% penetration of the Georgia Power
customer base.

FLA. COMMISSION APPROVES DSM GOALS
AND PLAN FOR LAKELAND ELECTRIC & WATER

The Florida Public Service Commission approved on Dec. 19 conservation
goals and plans for the Lakeland Electric & Water Dept., after the
municipal utility reached agreement with the state's Dept. of Community
Affairs.
   The conservation plan says that by the end of 2005 Lakeland must
guarantee 26.9 MW in winter and 33.5 MW in summer of savings from
residential customers (Docket Nos. 930556-EG and 950445-EG). That same
year, Lakeland plans to guarantee 3.2 MW in winter and 11.6 MW in summer of
savings from commercial/industrial customers.
   The PSC, however, rejected the muni's request to use demand and energy
savings from one customer class to make up shortfalls in another customer
class. The PSC said a ruling on that issue was premature and that Lakeland
should not ask unless the situation occurred.
   Plans for nine other of the state's largest muni's and cooperatives were
approved by the PSC in late November, while plans for the state's four
largest investor-owned utilities received commission approval in May (SPR,
1 Dec., 11; 2 May, 11). Only two utilities required to submit plans remain:
Tallahassee Electric Dept. (Docket No. 930559-EG) and Florida Public
Utilities (Docket No. 930552-EG), which is a small investor-owned utility.
