The scene is New York City, but it could be anywhere. <P>

	Commuters jam the underwater tunnel linking the island of Manhattan with New Jersey. Traffic is heavy--the usual mix of outward-bound workers and visitors, commercial and industrial vehicles, and people just passing through. All in all, a typical evening rush hour until... The toughest commute in the world suddenly becomes the deadliest. <P>


	On the 20th anniversary of the release of Rocky, the Oscar-winning underdog tale that ignited one of the most remarkable careers in modern show business history, international box-office heavyweight Sylvester Stallone explodes on the screen in Universal Pictures' presentation of Rob Cohen's suspenseful action drama Daylight. <P>

	A traffic accident sparks a devastating explosion, trapping a small group of people in the tunnel. Before them is a vision of Hell: a dim, stifling world, filled with the victims of the spectacular fireball that roared through the tunnel from end to end and illuminated by toxic flames flickering eerily in the distance. The air is foul with noxious gases and smoke. Huge slabs of concrete and twisted masses of metal are everywhere as the weakened tunnel begins to collapse on itself. Worst of all, the river churns above, its freezing waters impatient to come rushing through to reclaim its own. As more and more sections of the tunnel come crashing down behind and in front of them, the survivors--ordinary citizens from all walks of life--come to the terrifying realisation that they may die at any moment by suffocation, drowning or fire. <P>

	The only hope is Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone), the disgraced former head of Emergency Medical Services, who risks his life in a harrowing journey through the tunnel's unstable ventilation system to reach them. But once inside the tunnel, Kit becomes trapped with the others and is forced to improvise a roller-coaster ride of escape to lead the group back to daylight.<P>

	A Davis Entertainment/Joseph M. Singer production, Daylight was directed by Rob Cohen and co-stars Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, Jay O. Sanders, Karen Young, Claire Bloom, Barry Newman and Stan Shaw, with Renoly Santiago, Marcello Thadford and Sage Stallone. The screenplay was written by Leslie Bohem. John Davis, Joseph M. Singer and David T. Friendly served as producers, with Paul Neesan serving as co-executive producer. <P>

	Joining director Cohen on Daylight is executive producer Raffaella De Laurentiis, who previously served as producer on Cohen's films Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story and Dragonheart, as well as other longtime Cohen-DeLaurentiis collaborators, cinematographer David Eggby, editor Peter Amundson and music composer Randy Edelman. "Whenever There Is Love" (from Daylight) written by Bruce Roberts and Sam Roman, is performed over the end titles by Bruce Roberts and Donna Summer.<P>
