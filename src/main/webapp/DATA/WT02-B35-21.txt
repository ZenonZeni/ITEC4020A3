WISCONSIN PSC MODIFIES EXISTING ELECTRIC SERVICE
EXTENSION RULES BY EXTENDING THE REFUND PERIOD

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (commission) has
decided to modify its current set of electric service
extension rules to lessen the financial impact upon customers
who wish to extend service to previously undeveloped areas.
The Commission indicated that a wholesale change in the
current rules was not appropriate because it would likely
contribute to urban sprawl, but it was reasonable to extend
the refund period for those customers.

Extension rules determine who pays for the cost incurred in
extending electric utility service to a previously unserved
area. When a customer applies for an extension with a utility
where existing distribution lines are far from the dwelling,
the utility has to extend a distribution line all the way in
to the new location. The customer is responsible for the cost
of the distribution line in advance.

Under the current extension rules the customer is entitled to
a small credit based on the depreciated cost of the
distribution system. The customer is also eligible for
refunds when other customers attach to the same distribution
line that he or she paid for.

CHEVRON GETS GO-AHEAD TO EXPLORE
1.77-MILLION-ACRE TRACT IN PERU

Chevron Overseas Petroleum (Peru) Limited has signed a license
contract with PeruPetro S.A. to explore more than 1.77 million
acres on Block 52 in the Peruvian highlands.

Chevron's exploration program will include a seismic program
and other geologic studies, and is anticipated to start
immediately. Following acquisition and interpretation of the
geologic and seismic data, determinations regarding drilling
will be made.

Block 52 is located 250 miles east of the capital city of
Lima and is adjacent to the giant Camisea gas/condensate
discoveries. It comprises 718,928 hectares (more than 1.77
million acres), and has had no previous exploration activity.

"We are delighted to be returning to Peru," said Richard
Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, "and we are
eager to begin exploration in such an exciting area. We feel
Block 52 offers excellent potential due to its geologic
similarities with and geographic proximity to the prolific
Camisea fields," he added.

Chevron's history in Peru dates back to the 1930s when the
company conducted geological exploration in the foothills of
the Andes. In addition, Chevron operated a refinery in
Conchan, Peru, until 1972.

The Peruvian government's newly revised hydrocarbon laws and
noted that they have enhanced the appeal of operating in Peru
by offering favorable terms and encouraging foreign investment
in the country.

MITCHELL'S REMAINING INTEREST IN THE WOODLANDS
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FOR $17 MILLION

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., The Woodlands, TX, has
sold its remaining 50 percent interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network to TCI Communications, Inc., for $17
million, making TCI Communications the sole owner.

This business was started by Mitchell to serve The Woodlands
when it opened in October 1974 and provides cable television,
home security and advertising services. In April 1987,
Mitchell sold a. half interest to United Artists Cable.  Tele-
Communications, Inc. (TCI) acquired United Artists' cable
systems in 1991, including its half interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George P. Mitchell said
the sale of the remaining interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network is part of the company's continuing
efforts to enhance profitability by selling non-core assets,
including those that have a greater value to others. The
company has sold more than $200 million in assets during the


last 18 months, Mitchell added.

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. is among the nation's
largest independent producers of natural gas and natural gas
liquids. The company, through its subsidiary, The Woodlands
Corporation, also is the developer of a 25,000-acre
master-planned community 27 miles north of Houston. Mitchell's
shares are traded on the New York and Pacific stock exchanges
under the symbols MND A (voting) and MND B (non-voting).

SPECIAL CHARGES REDUCE CHEVRON'S THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME
TO $282 ON OPERATING EARNINGS OF $504 MILLION UP 24 PERCENT

Chevron Corporation has reported that special charges reduced
third quarter net income 34 percent to $282 million, or $.44
per share, from $425 million ($.65 per share) reported for the
third quarter of 1994.

Excluding special charges, 1995 third quarter results were
$504 million, a 24 percent increase from adjusted earnings of
$407 million for the prior year quarter. Special charges
totaled $222 million and included a $168 million provision
related to the company's recently announced decision to
dispose of its real estate development operations.

Commenting on third quarter results, Chairman and CEO Ken
Derr said, "We're pleased to report another quarter with
operating profit that exceeded half a billion dollars.
Despite flat crude oil and lower natural gas prices compared
with the third quarter of last year, our operating earnings
increased' nearly $100 million, reflecting ongoing strength
in our chemicals and international upstream businesses and our
continued emphasis on reducing costs."

Derr continued, "Our increased profitability this year
translates to a return on capital employed, adjusted for
special items, of 10.2 percent for the 12 months ended Sept.
30. This compares with a return of 8.6 percent for the
calendar year 1994, and demonstrates good progress toward our
12.0 percent goal."

Adjusted for special items, earnings for the first nine
months of 1995 were $1.511 billion, up 38 percent from $1.093
billion for the 1994 nine months. Net income for the 1995
nine months was $1.348 billion, or $2.07 per share, including
special charges totaling $163 million; net income for the
comparable prior year period was $1.070 billion, or $1.64 per
share, and included $23 million of special charges.

"We have a major turnaround currently under way at our
Richmond, Calif., refinery," said Derr. The refinery is
expected to be down for about six weeks to prepare for the
introduction of California-mandated reformulated gasolines
early next year. When the turnaround is complete, we will be
positioned to be the largest producer of these new gasolines.
However, the shutdown will have an effect on our fourth
quarter operations."

Total revenues in the third quarter were $9.3 billion, down 2
percent from $9.5 billion in the year earlier quarter. Total
revenues for the first nine months of 1995 were $27.9
billion, a 5 percent increase from $26.6 billion reported for
the 1994 nine-month period.

Included in third quarter net income were foreign exchange
losses of $26 million in 1995 and $30 million in 1994. For the
first nine months, foreign exchange losses were $20 million
in 1995 and $51 million in 1994.

U.S. exploration and production third quarter net earnings
were $131 million compared with $63 million in the 1994 third
quarter. However, current quarter earnings included a net
benefit of $19 million from special items, whereas 1994
earnings were reduced $61 million for environmental
remediation and litigation provisions. In the 1995 quarter, a
$27 million gain resulting from a refund of federal offshore
lease costs was partially offset by environmental remediation
provisions.

Excluding special items in both quarters, 1995 earnings of
$112 million declined from year-ago earnings of $124 million,
primarily because of lower production volumes and lower
natural gas prices. The company's average U.S. liquids
realization of $14.91 per barrel was little changed from the
$15.03 realized in last year's third quarter; however,
average natural gas realizations of $1.40 per thousand cubic
feet in the 1995 third quarter were down 14 percent from
$1.62 last year. Net liquids production declined to 346,000
barrels per day from 371,000, and net natural gas production
volumes of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day were down 10 percent
from 2.0 billion in last year's third quarter. The lower
production levels were due to normal field declines and a
natural gas field unitization adjustment.

Depreciation expense declined in line with lower production;
exploration expense also declined due to lower well
write-offs.

International exploration and production third quarter net
earnings were $140 million compared with $131 million in the
1994 third quarter. The 1995 quarter included special charges
of $22 million for prior year tax adjustments, mostly due to
a statutory tax rate increase in Australia.

Earnings benefited from higher crude oil sales volumes, due
to the timing of vessel loadings, and a lower effective income
tax rate due to the earnings mix. Crude oil and natural gas
realizations were about flat with the prior year quarter.
Exploration expenses increased due to higher well write-offs.
International net liquids production volumes increased
slightly to 644,000 barrels per day from 640,000 in the 1994
third quarter. Net natural gas production volumes declined
about 6 percent, primarily in Canada, to 539 million cubic
feet per day.

U.S. refining and marketing net earnings were $98 million
compared with a loss of $110 million in the year-ago quarter;
however, when special charges in both periods for
environmental remediation are excluded, earnings were
basically flat at $109 million for the current year quarter
and $108 million for the 1994 quarter.

Refined product sales margins improved in the 1995 quarter on
slightly higher prices. Sales volumes declined 13 percent to
1.2 million barrels per day, as a result of the sales of the
company's Philadelphia refinery in August 1994 and Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery in February 1995. The volume decline
occurred in lower margin unbranded bulk sales; branded
gasoline sales through the company's marketing system
increased 2 percent.

International refining and marketing net earnings declined
slightly to $53 million from $55 million because of special
charges of $15 million in the 1995 third quarter related to
restructurings in certain Caltex areas and in the company's
United Kingdom operations.

Excluding the special charges, earnings increased $13 million
as improved operations in Canada and the United Kingdom more
than offset a decline in Caltex earnings, where sales margins
remain depressed in some of that affiliate's operating areas.
International sales volumes decreased 4 percent to 894,000
barrels per day, largely due to declines in U.K. marketing
sales and in the company's international trading operations.
Caltex sales volumes decreased 1 percent.

Chemicals net earnings increased to $127 million in the 1995
third quarter from $68 million in the comparable 1994 quarter.
Adjusting for special charges in both periods, mostly
environmentally related, earnings of $148 million in the 1995
third quarter were more than double the $72 million earned in
the third quarter of 1994.

The higher 1995 earnings reflect higher product prices and
sales volumes compared with the prior year quarter, consistent
with the improved state of the petrochemicals industry.
However, prices for the company's major products began to
soften in the third quarter, and results declined from the
record $175 million earned in the second quarter. Although
still much stronger than a year ago, prices have weakened for
major products such as styrene and polyethylene.

Corporate and other net charges were $277 million in the
current year quarter compared with income of $212 million in
the 1994 third quarter. Both quarter's results were distorted
by special items. The 1995 quarter included special charges
totaling $172 million, almost all related to the write-down of
the company's investment in the real estate development
business. Results in the 1994 quarter included the reversal of
$301 million of previously established tax and related
interest reserves resulting from a global settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service covering several open tax years.

Excluding the special items in both periods, corporate and
other charges were $105 million in the 1995 third quarter and
$89 million in the year-ago quarter. The 1995 increase was due
to consolidating income tax adjustments.

Capital and exploratory expenditures, including the company's
share of affiliate expenditures, were $1.144 billion in the
third quarter, compared with $1.042 billion spent in last
year's third quarter. Total expenditures for the first nine
months of 1995 were $3.292 billion, up 4 percent from $3.174
billion spent in the same period in 1994.

MITCHELL REPORTS LOWER THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., The Woodlands, TX,
has reported that its net earnings for the three months ended
Oct. 31, 1995, declined to $11.3 million, or 21 cents a share,
from $15 million, or 28 cents a share, in the same period a
year earlier.

Excluding unusual gains and charges in both years, earnings
were $15 million, versus $10.6 million in the prior-year
period. Current-quarter results were adversely affected by
several factors: significantly lower natural gas prices in
North Texas due to the termination of the premium-priced gas
sales contract covering this production in July 1995; weak
spot market prices; a 23-day curtailment in October of gas
and natural gas liquids production in North Texas resulting
from maintenance on the interstate pipeline that transports
Mitchell's gas from this area to Midwest markets; and a
47-day shutdown of the company's one-third-owned MTBE gasoline
additive plant to increase capacity. These factors were more
than offset by profits totaling $19.4 million ($12.6 million
after tax)

Real estate operating earnings increased to $28.9 million,
from $6.3 million during the prior year's third quarter. Much
of the improvement results from the previously discussed $19.4
million cable TV gain. Current-period earnings also
benefitted from an increase in residential lot sales in The
Woodlands at prices 8 percent higher per square foot than
those realized in the prior-year period, improved occupancy
at The Woodlands Executive Conference Center and Resort, and
earnings from The Woodlands Mall, which opened in October
1994.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the
company had net earnings of $13.6 million, or 26 cents per
share, compared with $36.8 million, or 70 cents per share, in
the same period last year. Excluding unusual items in both
years, earnings during the current period were $41.1 million,
versus $28.1 million during the prior-year period.
Year-to-date results benefitted from higher natural gas
liquids margins, profits from the MTBE plant, the gain from
the cable system sale, increased earnings from residential and
commercial activities in The Woodlands and lower staff and
interest expenses. These factors were partially offset by
lower gas prices resulting from the buyout of the North Texas
gas sales contract and weak spot market prices.

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. is a large independent
energy producer and through its subsidiary, The Woodlands
Corporation, is the developer of a 25,000-acre master-planned
community located 27 miles north of downtown Houston. Its
shares are listed on the Now York and Pacific stock exchanges
under the symbols MND A (voting) and MND B (non-voting).

MURPHY OIL REORTS ON THIRD QUARTER

Murphy Oil's president and CEO, Claiborne P.  Deming,
announced today that net income for the third quarter of 1995
totaled $7.6 million, $.17 a share, compared to $37.3 million,
$.83 a share, earned in the third quarter a year ago.  The
current quarter included a bensfit of $8.1 million, $.18 a
share, resulting from settlement of tax matters in the U.S.
and U.K., while the third quarter of 1994 included a benefit
of $13.9 million, $.31 a share, from settlement of a U.S.
Department of Energ Proposed Remedial Order. Net cash from
operating activities excluding changes in noncash working
capital items totaled $84.2 million in the third quarter of
1995, down six percent from a year ago.

In commenting on the results for the current quarter, Mr.
Deming said, "Excluding the unusual item, operating results
reflected a loss of $.5 million that included a $13.6 million
after-tax charge for a previously announced unsuccessful well
in Mobile Block 908. In total, exploration and production
operations lost $5 million in the third quarter of 1995
compared to earning $9.8 million a year ago.

In addition to the Mobile Block 908 well, the current quarter
was adversely affected by generally lower crude oil sales
prices, lower U.S. and Canadian natural gas sales prices, and
an increase in international exploration activity. Partial
offsets were provided by a 12-percent increase in crude oil
and gas liquids production and a 10-percent increase in
natural gas production. Posted price for West Texas
Intermediate crude oil fluctuated between $15.00 a barrel and
$17.25 a barrel in the third quarter of 1995, and closed the
quarter at $15.75.

"Barnings from our worldwide downstream segment totaled $4.2
million in the current quarter compared to $11.9 million a
year ago. U.S. operations accounted for most of the decline as
a result of lower unit margins and a decline in salso of
refined products.

"Earnings from farm, timber, and real estate totaled $1.3
million, a decreases of 58 percent compared to the third
quarter of 1994. Timber operations accounted for most of the
decline."

Exploration and production operations in the U.S., which
included the $13.6 million after-tax charge for the Mobile
Block 908 well, lost $8.9 million compared to earning $.7
million in the third quarter of 1994. Operations in Canada
earned $6.3 million in the current quarter, up from $6.2
million a year ago, and U.K. operations earned $.9 million
compared to $1 million.
