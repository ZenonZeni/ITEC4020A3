<h1>The Wrong Message Of Legalizing Illicit Drugs </h1>

<p><b>By the Partnership for a Drug-Free America</b> </p>

<p>18-Aug-94 </p>

<hr>

<p>A new publication that discusses that any policy discussion
that includes consideration of legalizing illicit drugs reflects
either a complete misunderstanding or ignorance of the key
factors that affect trial and use of these substances.
Legalization sends the societal message of public approval,
eroding the anti-drug attitudes of our youth and encouraging them
to try and use illegal drugs. What we need is the reverse --
establishing the unequivocal message that our public behavior
standard and social norm is 'no-use,&quot; continuously
reinforced </p>

<p>through the attitudes of harm/risk and social disapproval that
are prevent inhibitors to our youth trying and using these
substances. </p>

<p>First, it is critical to recognize that drug abuse is, at its
core, the result of the demand we as individuals and society
create for these drugs. Prior to drug use becoming the disease of
addiction, all drug trial and use is the result of
decisions/choices we make to use or not use. The primary
determinant in these decisions are the </p>

<p>attitudes of 1) perceived harm/risk and 2) social disapproval.
This is true across ethnicity, demography and geography. All
progress in reducing drug use and, ultimately, addiction, is the
result of increasing anti- drug attitudes in order to change the
behavior. </p>

<p>The message of legalization is precisely antithetical to
everything we've learned about preventing the demand for illegal
drugs. The epidemic of illegal drug use over the past three
decades was the result of these substances, their use, and their
users becoming &quot;normalized&quot; -perceived as benign and an
accepted part of normal social behavior. Normalization has led to
nearly 80 million Americans having tried illegal drugs. Because
we did not understand the impairment and harm that results from
using illegal drugs, we passively and actively moved away from
the behavior standard and social norm of no-use. </p>

<p>The reverse process of &quot;denormalization&quot; that began
with the death of Len Bias in 1986 has resulted in a decline of
more than 50% in the number of Americans using illicit drugs.
This fact is not well known, and probably is responsible for much
of the sense of hopelessness and helplessness that often
surrounds the issue of drug abuse. As a nation, we began to
recognize the harmfulness of drug use, and we began to
re-establish the social norm of no- use. All the declines in
trial and non-addicted use of illicit drugs are directly
correlated </p>

<p>with the increase in the attitudes of perceived harm/risk and
social disapproval. </p>

<p>Importantly, however, most recent trends among young teens
indicate an erosion in their key anti-drug attitudes of risk and
disapproval, resulting in higher usage rates of marijuana, LSD,
cocaine and inhalants. Further confusion in the behavior standard
and social norm of no-use, especially consideration of legalizing
(read 'normalizing&quot;) illicit drugs, will surely accelerate
this disturbing trend and put us back into the drug epidemic of
the 1970's and early 1980's. </p>
