<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A CASE PRESENTATION FROM AN ALTERNATIVE PHYSICIAN</H3>
<BR>
<B>In contrast to much of the information your physicians are exposed to (see
previous page), this ongoing column will present a case study as experienced by
various members of the alternative medical community.</B>

<P><B>This month's story is presented by Serafina Corsello, M.D., director of the
Corsello Centers in New York City and Huntington, New York:</B>

<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Stress increases energy requirements and creates a demand for an expanded
supply of energy-yielding glucose. Wouldn't it be wonderful if emotions such as 
anger, anxiety,
depression, fear, grief, guilt, jealousy, and shame - emotions associated with
stress could be tempered simply by controlling blood sugar levels? I have
discovered in my clinical practice that GTF chromium polynicotinate may be able
to do just that in some circumstances.

<P>"Sadly, a whole generation of medical doctors and scientists in this 
country appear to be unaware that stress and anxiety can be diminished 
through nurtritional manipulations that can normalize metabolic pathways.

<P>"Sarah came to me complaining of feeling 'stressed out.' She reported extreme
mood swings, with frequent exaggerated perceptions of threatening events. Sarah
was a noninsulin-dependent diabetic, needing to rely on lifestyle diet changes
for control. Like all diabetics, she loved sugar. As her poorly-regulated sugar
levels seesawed, so did her insulin and adrenalin causing mood swings, fatigue,
sweats, dizziness, headaches, and disorientation. Because insulin is lipogenic
(fat-producing), her cholesterol level was 320 and triglycerides, 225. Her LDL
(the "bad-guy" cholesterol) was elevated and she assumed the fatty and flabby
appearance of poorly-regulated diabetics."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<CENTER><H3>"I PRESCRIBED 800 MICROGRAMS
<BR>OF GTF CHROMIUM."</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I prescribed 800 micrograms of GTF chromium. Diabetics need at least 600 to 800
micrograms, especially if they are overweight. Sarah weighed 250 pounds.

<P>"I also instructed Sarah to walk daily, eat five small meals instead of three 
larger ones with emphasis on fish and vegetables. The change in diet 
helped to eliminate her distended stomach and her cravings for sugar.

<P>"Eating large meals triggers insulin production and disregulated sugar levels,
creating cardiovascular problems and mood fluctuations. Soon, Sarah lost weight
and began to feel human again. Today, Sarah's blood sugar metabolism, lipid
profile, and moods are in total harmony, and she looks ten years younger!

<P>"For those interested in understanding why Sarah was helped with the addition of
chromium, its answer is that chromium regulates insulin, which in turn helps to
overcome insulin resistance, which in turn helps to optimize the function of the
hypothalamus a deep brain structure that controls all internal organ functions."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<CENTER><H3>"PART OF THE ANSWER: CHROMIUM
<BR>REGULATES INSULIN."</H3></CENTER>   
<HR>
    
<BLOCKQUOTE>"When stress signals are set off, the reaction begins in your brain.The response
travels to your cerebral deep structures and from there to all endocrine glands.
Your hypothalamus is top kingpin of your brain's functions, including reactions
to the stress response. It works like the dispatching station of a
telecommunications center its call of warning ready to sound at a microsecond's
notice.
<P>"So you can see how proper lifestyle modifications and keeping your metabolism
in good shape with chromium is essential for relieving stress symptoms and
reversing cardiovascular problems. And it surely doesn't hurt that all this
makes you look younger, too."
