<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>Only perverts will look up the most perverted sights, so if you don't like it, don't look!
<LI>It should be more.  In every aspect.
<LI>sex should be available to adults (except unnatural se  peds etc.) Children should only be exposed to what they can handle
<LI>Everyone is charging something and all I want to do is surf...
<LI>I don't think it's bad or anything.  It's a natural curiosity.
<LI>It should stay!!!!!!
<LI>I think it provides a safe and somewhat anonymous area to exchange sexual ideas and fantasies.
<LI>ok for mature adults
<LI>Leave it alone!  Don't fix things that aren't broken.
<LI>i think it is adult fun to browse and find sexually explicit material
<LI>it keeps me out of the strip bars..which is a good thing..
<LI>I have found vey little about people sharing my concerns
<LI>I enjoy looking and reading the stories,the relastionship I AM IN THIS HELP ME SERVIVE ,iSTAY WITH MY FAMILY JUST FOR THE KIDS,AND YES I KNOW THIS IS WRONG but maybe in the near future I can correct this.
<LI>I am the forum administrator for two religious discussion groups on the internet.  I believe offensive material is difficult to find, unless you are specifically looking for it - outside of Usenet, of course. %:^) I don't believe the government should cen
<LI>I like it  I like it I wish there were more sex chat lines that I could get on. please fell free to let me know about  any other sex chat lines that you know about at  snr@westworld.com   thanks for all:>
<LI>I think the openess and availabilty of sex on the 'NET is a definate asset.  It seems to work more as an outlet to sexual tensions etc ...
<LI>i think its great
<LI>i think that it is okay becouse sex is all around us every day
<LI>It's on the net and your not going yo get it off so sit down and shut up
<LI>very good
<LI>not what a lot of people believ it to be {not much there} ;]
<LI>I think its great
<LI>safer and less degrading than anything else
<LI>I love it....wish that some accesses were a little more user friendly
<LI>good idea
<LI>Porn is immoral, no matter where it is.
<LI>too much pornography, too much pedophilia.....it should be auto-regulated
<LI>I think its informative. I have certainly learnt a few things here on the net.
<LI>very overated and boring
<LI>I love it!  I just keep falling off! just kidding ;)  I think sex on the net promotes safe sex.  I would rather someone masterbate than go out and rape to get it.
<LI>should be more
<LI>Morals campaingers exagerate internet sex content.  Voluntary restraints only need apply (parental guidance, etc).  Externally enforced regulations (laws, etc) control much of our lives - let the internet be a place of freedom.  With freedom comes responsability - be responsible for yourself and your actions.
<LI>It's not as much fun as a real live body . . . 
<LI>sex has noting to do with the net. people do what thay want. You can't regulate that, People wont stand for it. Wich has been proved agian and agian.
<LI>Good for people who want it...too much there for people who don't!
<LI>THERE IS SO MUCH SEX ON THE NET FROM GAY TO STRAIGHT PICS. I GUESS THEY ALL TURN ME ON.
<LI>If you're looking for it, sex may be found everywhere, so why should the Net be different. Humans are by nature sexual creatures. Yet, some among us would have us deny this. What children do, see, hear or read is the business of parents and guardians, not government!
<LI>Not too experienced on the net, need to know more.
<LI>pornography is far less offensive to me than violence or people who would shove their religious values down my throat.
<LI>I think it is dam cool
<LI>I LOVE IT
<LI>so it's there, big deal. If you dont like it turn it off....
<LI>I can't Stop!!!!
<LI>Love the erotic stories.....
<LI>I love it because I think it improves my sexual stimulaton, it encourages me to masturbate; which is good because I need to know my body a little more.  It shows me all the different "sites and scenery" that is out there other than my boyfriend.  I think 
<LI>It's great. You can have everything and it costs nothing
<LI>I do not like having sex with the internet, cause the internet is an inatimate object.  I am not.
<LI>What happened to the days when parents were totally responsible?
<LI>I find that the Internet is much more valuable as a tool for links to others who work in the same field I work in.  Sex is, at best, available only by proxy (in that it has not, for me, ever led to any actualy physical encounters.)  I have been able to search for information of a wide range of subjects, more so than I could from my local library.  Sex is a part of what seems to be available, but for me it is hardly the most important reason for access in the Internet.
<LI>its cool
<LI>From what I have seen, it is adults interacting no differently than you would find in any bar type situation
<LI>it is too expensive
<LI>STILL TRYING TO FIND URLS
<LI>nuthin much.....just lots of it....im a nympho!!!!!!!!11
<LI>FUCK YOU !!!!!!!
<LI>its really hard to answer this one i have new comp. and still exploring 
<LI>no comment
<LI>they are both GREAT but sex is the king!!
<LI>Since I was 15 I have had sex in many different styles, I did it on bus's in fact the is not many places I had not done it. I thought I know it all untill I got on the internet it told me things I did not think possible. 
<LI>its good
<LI>OK
<LI>I like it.
<LI>great, wish there was more of it
<LI>nothing
<LI>it would be good
<LI>I still don't know
<LI>It's GRRRRRATE!!!
<LI>I love it
<LI>Good way to understand and learn about society and sex
<LI>If Adults want to view fine, but keep your kids off!!
<LI>I want sex
<LI>I think that the Christian right is just using this as another smoke screen.
<LI>They don't go together.
<LI>any resource is a good one
<LI>Bad thing. Good thing. Funny thing.
<LI>I think it provides an oppurtunity for those of us who are curious to experiment before any serious reprocussions
<LI>wish we could actually access it.
<LI>Sex is great fun and make me feel good
<LI>ok
<LI>Oh yes! PS I wonder if all the people who want to so-called "protect" children from one of the most natural areas of human experience were abused when they were children?
<LI>Like passing a bloody car wreck 
<LI>Its safe!!!!
<LI>Highlu overrated. Not a major problem to anyone but the most Puritanical minded people.
<LI>I prefer the real thing!
<LI>not a big deal... I wish everyone would grow up...
<LI>The internet is a good outlet for sexual expression, whether it be viewing sexual explicit material or talking to somebody else about sex
<LI>the internet should be a community without the interference if the govt. and in which people can express themselves freely
<LI>I think it is great, just like frosted flakes!
<LI>I like to download jpeg, it's exicting, you never know what you get, the men are usually great pics, big cocks, hot scenes, nice build, like to be really free and talk dirty
<LI>I think sex is great but it's a new experience on the net
<LI>The internet is a safe place to explore one's sexuality.  You don't have to worry about committing yourself to a situation that might be dangerous, and you can discover others who share your issues, concerns.  Often, you can learn how to express your sexuality in an appropriate manner and be responsible for the consequences.
<LI>People should not rely on or let the gov't to regulate the I'net.  
<LI>Most people oppose sex on the internet because of kids.  Well, parents need to take responsibility of their children!!  Besides there is all the sex and violence you'd want on cable TV.
<LI>I think it is interesting and informative
<LI>I feel that it is safe play for adults. Like an interactive porno book
<LI>I' m born FREE and I wanna be FREE
<LI>Sex on the Internet is a turn on and informative too!
<LI>whats the point!!!is our culture so obessed with sex that it permeates everything-get a real life!!!
<LI>yeah there's plenty... but you have to pay by credit card for it so under 18s cant access most of it anyway.
<LI>it is ok
<LI>I'm concerned about dangerous characters on the net ... otherwise ... whatever!
<LI>Not the best, but it helps
<LI>I think that sex in the internet is cool, because sometimes people have nothing better to do so they want to see dirty pictures
<LI>Should be for adults 18 or older. Should have password to go into pornography set by the owner of the pc.
<LI>Nothing better
<LI>I want to know where to find someone to talk to
<LI>It's really to hard to find.  I wish there was an easy way to get a hold of it.  Please try and correct this.
<LI>Mail Me!! schr0009@metnet.edu
<LI>It's good entertainment
<LI>I think it has given me new ideas and if parents don't want their kids to see sex on the internet, then they should keep a closer eye on their kids or have the kids ask them to put in their password!
<LI>Haven't encountered it.
<LI>Interesting and exotic,something different,this makes it what it is.
<LI>I don't agree that minors should be exposed to sexually explicit material, but I do agree that the internet as a sex education tool could be very useful. It is ultimately the responsibility of the administrators of sites which contain sexually explicit material to ensure that all reasonably necessary security precautions are in place to make it more difficult for minors to obtain access, and the parents of children have a responsibility to ensure that those children don't have easy access (because let'
 face it, it's out there and if a kid REALLY wants to find it, they will.)
<LI>IT'S GREAT! I CAN SEE ANYTHING I WANT.
<LI>In general : Tasteless, and too damn easy to find.
<LI>I want more!  More and more
<LI>good
<LI>Too many sites have been blocked or require "membership" fees.  I paid for online services.  I should be able to see anything I choose without having to fork out additional fees.
<LI>It's a sham. The real vulgarities are violence, weapons and cruelties human beings perpetrate on one another and nothing much is ever said about that. Curious that the "evil" is one of the few brief pleasurable events in the course of a lifetime!
<LI>Encourage sleeping around, speed up the spreading of AIDS!!!
<LI>Not enough gay stuff!
<LI>Relax, Everything is working out as should be.
<LI>I personally feel that it is blown out of perportion!!  Yes there is alot of adult oriented materials out ther but if you look at it proportionally it is a drop in the bucket.  The amount of general information available is staggering and comparitively the pornographic stuff is only a small amount..
<LI>I think it's just big media hype...you can find sex anywhere anyway anyhow...not just on the net, besides all the pedophile cases happened on AOL "the safe online atmosphere". Parents should pay more attention to their kids rather than plopping them down in front of some screen (may it be tv or computer). Not to mention the fact the rules for strangers apply online too!
<LI>The government should stay out of it. 
<LI>TOO MUCH PUBLICITY
<LI>all naked pictures and things pertaining to sex should be restricted to a separate system
<LI>It's all about open mindedness.  If you don't like Sex on the net, don't look for it.  That easy. You probably don't have a sex life to begin with and need the Net to redeem yourself. :) (no specific targets for my allegations)
<LI>there's not nearly as much sex on the net as so-called "moral guardians" cliam there is
<LI>Sex ok
<LI>sex and the internet is a good place for people in general to learn about many aspects of sex. Iif an individual can find some information on the net, all the power to them. If tbe information is available, take a look. you may even learn something.
<LI>It's fun and kinky!
<LI>great
<LI>I ENJOY HAVING THE ACCESS WHEN I WANT AND WHAT I WANT
<LI>I think it's GREAT!
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is a good outlet for people.  It can discourage other methods of sexual outlet
<LI>Keep the damn government out of it!
<LI>I like it, however I belive it is overrated.
<LI>Personally I think if someone has a problem with the net they do not have to use it. I also think parents should be responsable for what their childeren can view on the net.
<LI>Promotes violence towards women & children.
<LI>It's a harmless passtime, but it shouldn't become an obsession.
<LI>Seems like a good way to contact many to find the few!
<LI>Those who are interested will find "it" on the net or elsewhere.
<LI>An excellent opportunity to explore, and perhaps sometime, experience my own personal fantacies
<LI>I think there is a lot of sexual material on the internet; but I think that it is the Parents/Guardians responsibility to monitor what their child is accessing.
<LI>a breath of fresh air
<LI>net enough experience
<LI>as i look for information on my own particular fettish and try to understand it, i was surprised at the amount of hard core pornoghrapy i ran into.  infantilism, or adult babies is what i need information on, not to have a partner in it, but to understand my own sexual patterns.
<LI>hard to find good FREE sites, I wouldn't mind paying but won't bother sending 5$ subscription from where I am (Europe, no credit card)
<LI>Pretty harmless. You're able to be a bit more open in, say, the IRC and it's fun. Harmless and fun!!!
<LI>If you want it you should be able to get it. If you don't , don't go there.
<LI>It's great for adults. Need to do something about childrens access.
<LI>The sex on the internet is mild in comparison to what is readily available at the local newsstand.
<LI>think it is great and hate censorship..if ya dont like it dont look at it..dont ruin it for rest of us
<LI>like bread and water
<LI>its A new medium for expressing ones desires
<LI>i dont desire
<LI>Frankly, I wish it were easier to find, and wish it could be more open. But then, maybe I do not know the proper keywords
<LI>I believe it gives people a chance to be more open, to be anyone they want, and to explore fantasies that they would not in real life.
<LI>give it to me NOW
<LI>While I'm not particularly offended by sexual content in mild form, some people are. It's hard to please everyone. I dislike lewd and foul language on the net, people using foul language should be warned and if repeated could face expulsion from the net. Other than that there is a time and a place (even on the net) for such things. Parents should be responsible to black out questionable material to protect children.
<LI>Its out there, but that's the way it should be.
<LI>non-harmful fun pastime
<LI>Too much emphasis on sex and Internet!  Let people be who they are...
<LI>I enjoy it because it's just recreational and totally safe.
<LI>Sex on the Internet dont bother me at all.
<LI>Love IT
<LI>should be here as long as people want it.
<LI>americans need to know the diff. of nudity vs phonograghy!
<LI>I think the Internet has opened an entire new level to sex - a new place to go, new sexes to taste, everything there is you may never have known about...just like all information
<LI>no answer
<LI>It's been overrated as a subject
<LI>would like to find stories of voyeurism and group sex
<LI>it's ok
<LI>COOL...two thumbs up!!
<LI>I feel that sex and the internet are a good combination!
<LI>I can't find real hard core
<LI>it gives me a good chance to fufil fanticies and masturbate
<LI>It's the best thing since sliced bread.
<LI>It is a way to explore my fanticies
<LI>It is GREAT!
<LI>Overrated
<LI>I wish I could find hardcore pictures and stories
<LI>Ithink that sex on the net is cool. It is a learning experience for everyone who uses it. I know that I have learned some new ideas and answers.
<LI>It's a great way to unwind.
<LI>more is better
<LI>It's great but very expensive!
<LI>Looking at it keeps you awake and going during the day.
<LI>It has helped have sex with many types of people, therfor I adore any thing on th e net.
<LI>i think it opens horizons
<LI>We all have secret fantasies, it just that some people put themselves above that do to the way they were raised.  I am a resectable adult and I actually have fun on the net.  And I haven't been corrupted or hurt in any way.  I find other opinions very interesting.:-)
<LI>i think it is great, it relieves stress and most of the time gives me a good laugh
<LI>Its a new world.
<LI>i think that the the telicommunications bill SUCKS
<LI>I THINK IT'S GREAT....
<LI>I like it.  I like to be able to chat about it whenever I want to.  We should be able to but at a regulated way.
<LI>sex is good, so is the internet, but sex is better.
<LI>EITHER I AM NAIVE OR JUST HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING IN THE RIGHT PLACES BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN LITTLE IF NOTHING ON THE NET THAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE "SEX." 
<LI>I think if someone wants to watch trash thats ok, but don't have it avaliable for young people. So keep it off the net......
<LI>Not aproblem until you make it one...
<LI>I love the Net!
<LI>I DON;T NEED THE INTERNET FOR SEX
<LI>quick
<LI>Similar to TV and radio -- Too much will hinder the net's ability to prosper in a "business" world.  There should be a mechanism to lock children out of sites with sexual content.
<LI>Very much present, but not confronting. I thing it would be hard for children to find hard core porn, and their parents should control operation anyway!
<LI>sex is great,the internet is great,we're all great,and some of us are damn good.
<LI>I think that it is my right to view pornography and as long as there is away to keep children from it, such as nanny, it should be allowed on the net.
<LI>very  interesting
<LI>I don't mind it, it's a good brian walk
<LI>I don't have a problem with people wanting to post stuff on the net that is sex related.
<LI>Its great
<LI>nah i will save it for myself
<LI>Online sex is a way of dealing with sexula frustrations that allows you to have a sexual experience with another partner without the home wrrecking side effects of having an affair.   I really enjoy making love to total strangers online and then when it's
<LI>I am writing a paper on sex on the internet and enjoyed this
<LI>its fun. it makes me hot!
<LI>I don't particularly care!
<LI>I think that looking for sexually explicit material can help to alleviate boredom... I see no reason to censor sexual material because it can easily be avoided if one takes offense... The only people that I think have any sort of right to censor are parents of children using the Web, and even then, the kids are going to find it if they want it anyway, so why bother trying to hide it?
<LI>They go hand in hand, but they are NOT the one and same.
<LI>I wish it was easier to search for what you are looking for.
<LI>Great
<LI>safe and enjoyable
<LI>It helps me to understand who I am.
<LI>I think it should'nt be forbidden on COLLEGE campuses!!!!
<LI>Sex is a part of life that people are facanated by. The internet should not be sencered sence it is just as esy to go into a bookstore and find materals about sex.
<LI>i don't konw much about the internet yet, so I can't really rate it.
<LI>Groovy
<LI>We have no right to censor other peoples personal choices, however I feel it should be subject to multiple passwords to ensure no unauthorized use occurs. Perhaps as clubs? The internet is for everybody. It CAN be shared responsibly by everyone!
<LI>I don't think there is anything wrong with consenting adults having access to sexually oriented material.
<LI>I think we should take more responsibility for policing our own families' values, and less time whining about other peoples' interests.
<LI>the government should keep their noses out of the net and the net should be completely open
<LI>I think people try to impose their own morals on others when they don't want in. Sex is what YOU make of it, not pictures. Pictures and communication satisfies curiosity.  It's the parents that need to get more involved, and stop blaming others for their screwups.
<LI>As I have stated previously, I believe that the parents/legal guardians should personally limit or completely eliminate the possibility of net access (or use the programs available to block pornography) for the ones in question.  I also think communication should not be limited for those of "legal age."  Parents have nothing worry about except their own teachings and time spent with their children.
<LI>i wish too find more hardcore photos for free on net
<LI>It is an outlet. It is good for those who need something
<LI>Not a problem at all, if parents take their role seriously.  Can be an educational experience!
<LI>I think it is great. There should be complete openess about it.
<LI>not enough------more more....and a lot more
<LI>If you don't like it, come back when you can't stay so long
<LI>i think it's fine.  when my child is old enough i will be there to monitor what she has access to...
<LI>I don't believe in censorship of any sort however I do believe in parents monitoring their children to ensure they don't encounter inappropriate material
<LI>It allows me to engage in things I cant anywhere else.
<LI>I think sex on the net promotes safe sex, rather than being out there actually fucking, people are at hom masturbating to pictures on their PC.
<LI>I think its fine.  I don't believe the government can enforce morality they tried it with proabition.. That didn't work.  So they should leave it as it is and let the parents montor it.  A kid can call a 900 # or steal their parents pornos and its much easier... 
<LI>Only recently purchased PC so I'm not qualified to have an opinion. However, as for porn, I believe parents should have the common sense to know that a kid will look for items related to sex.
<LI>its for sad people with no life.
<LI>It helps to understand
<LI>Met a potential partner to explore homosexuality...
<LI>outrageous
<LI>Good motivator for real erection and masturbation by this old fart.
<LI>everything should be open and only rated 
<LI>It's OK.  I think it can help some people.  It's also a safe outlet in this diseased world.
<LI>It is a very good thing. Not everyone has a computer.
<LI>It's a medium like magazines and other mediums.
<LI>Sex, like everything else in life has to be dealt with carefully.  We should be taught to deal with it responsibly, not to avoid it.
<LI>Sex is wonderful!
<LI>Good potential for distribution of opinions and information
<LI>It ok 
<LI>some of the material is masked as to what it really is.  Somewhat concerns me with small children in my house.
<LI>Very Good!
<LI>I feel it is impossible to keep it off the net but it can be regulated by ratings and s/w that restricts access. It is not a plcae for government intervention.
<LI>I LOVE IT KEEP IT COMING!!!
<LI>Sex and the Internet is NO BIG DEAL. I think it helps you to keep an open mind on all issues.
<LI>I think, for single individuals, it is a way to vent their sexual frustrations. I feel it is ok so long watch it in the privacy of your home...
<LI>The topic is overblown but a real concern.  The net needs to learn that with power comes responsibility, and freedom isn't license.  I don't think everyone will learn that.
<LI>nice, hhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<LI>Find
<LI>It is private and safe to do in your own home, but kids should be blocked from the really bad areas of the net and parents should over see their kids experiences with the net.
<LI>Sex is a mustä
<LI>Like all issues bordering on social Acceptability, I beleive Fringe groups portray the overall situation incorectly
<LI>I like it, I love it, I want more of it.
<LI>Waste of time
<LI>It gets tiring
<LI>If it feels good...
<LI>Sex on the net is fine as long as degrading sex acts and child porn is kept off!
<LI>It's really like a more available porno store, and most of the time it's free, unless you subscribe to online Hustler and the like.  The internet is still a relatively new form of media, so the regulation I believe is yet to to come.  I like the sex stuff
<LI>i wish there was more masturbation themes and beastiality
<LI>i love it
<LI>Considering the huge number of people who log on to the various Porno pages, it appears they are fulfilling a need in society.fillings that it is satisfying a need
<LI>I don't feel that it is the governments place to censor the net.  I feel that any material that could be obtained elsewhere should be available on the net.  If parents have a problem with this then they should assume the responsibilty for their children and monitor computer activities.
<LI>Technology has gone too far now that people can have sex on the internet, that is why I am choosing to write a research paper on it.  
<LI>Ruined my marriage - my spouse found a long distance lover.  Later it turned a long term relationship/marriage (22 years) into divorce - you maybe next - its starts very innocently and gets out of control.
<LI>good survey.  Glad I could help.
<LI>I think taking away from anyones rights, just for a minority, is what the Constitution was made to protect us from.  I have a right to look at pornography, and someone else has the right not to.  Maybe some kind of rating system could eb set up, but there are programs that could be written to make sure that a child couldn't look at pornography.  Why this isn't done, I have no idea.  
<LI>It's free, it's everywhere!
<LI>I'm grateful it is available if I want it.
<LI>It is difficult to find exactly what I am looking for for the project I am doing in my understandind human sexuality course
<LI>you need more perverted stuff and stories
<LI>Let it be. It is a part of life so why hide it!
<LI>i think it's great. i only wish i had a computer in my bathroom.,
<LI>I think it should not be there to tempt people(me).  Maintain moral traditions in this country.
<LI>Can be very helpful to a couple
<LI>sex is fun..internet too...
<LI>Internet with Sex is good, like life with sex is good.
<LI>Should be accessable to adults only by registration.
<LI>It's a free country
<LI>It is a shame that the same perverts who prey on children in our society have caused serious consideration for censorship on the net.
<LI>do not infringe on my first amendment rights.you will not get my vote!!!!! clinton do you hear me!!!! sex on the internet has to be looked for and found. parents stand up and take responsibility.!!!! thank you. i hope this survey is put to good use....
<LI>Oh gosh, it's fun and kinda boring all at the same time.
<LI>I think it has been enlightening
<LI>It is a great communications medium...
<LI>Oh gosh, it's fun and kinda boring all at the same time.
<LI>a new experience for a new generation
<LI>Never been involved in looking for sex sights until now.  Hope the survey proves worthwhile
<LI>Everything (esp. pics) on my service is censored.  This is ridiculous.  It is extremely frustrating.
<LI>The net is some peoples way of learning about sex!
<LI>it's taught me a lot
<LI>it is fun(the internet)
<LI>I think it's great at times, the best is because you don't know who the other person is.
<LI>It is great!  If you want it you can go get it and learn about the real world out there.  You cannot hide our inborn drives, as hard as you may try we are still bilogical creatures and no matter how much our minds grow our bodies will lag behind AND control our behavior biologically!
<LI>It's there if you want but noone forces it on you!!!
<LI>anyone can search and find what they are looking for as far  as sex is concerned.
<LI>can't get access; think it would be great
<LI>I beleive in total freedom of expression.  It is up to each individual to screen out what offends them.
<LI>Harmless anonimity could be a neat thing for some,but useless for others. I prefer skin in most social settings, but I am very moral in my approach to my marraige. It might be a "harmless" thing, it might not.
<LI>It's ok for adults but not for little kids who are just "surfing".
<LI>Personal responsibility for oneself or family.  But how possible is that concept in America's Blame Someone Else culture?
<LI>very entertaining
<LI>Sex is GOOD
<LI>The government is too big already, they need to leave the net alone.  How do they think they could regulate pages from foreign countries, anyway?
<LI>It's really not that big of a deal
<LI>i don't have a problem with it. it helps people express themselves in a safe way. it shouldn't be monitored in any way. those that have a problem with it should just not go to those sites, or leave them if they happen to end up on one. with regards to chi
<LI>it is a new medium to teach and learn about sex
<LI>i like it i think it is a way to mindlessly surf the net. i look for xxx rated sexual material on the net as a way to relax or past the time
<LI>its ok
<LI>I wish I could see more
<LI>Sex on the net rules!!!
<LI>Fun!
<LI>I think it's "all good" and I have sex on line whenever I can.
<LI>i think it is a great learning experience
<LI>Sex appears to be a part of everything in our lives so it is only natural that it would be on the internet.  I don't believe that any laws will prevent this I also don't believe that it is any more difficult or easier to obtain then in printed form.
<LI>don't have to much to say on the subject right now.
<LI>Available, but parents should monitor/restrict access with a password or encryption (pgp?)
<LI>I would like to chat with hetero guys & gals.
<LI>I am new to the Internet, therefore, I cannot make any valid comments either way.
<LI>It should be more
<LI>I think sex on the net is another form of adult entertainment.  It is similar to viewing adult movies and reading adult magazines
<LI>It is a good that it can provide sex information to anyone whose have questions about sex
<LI>i have no problems with it.
<LI>I think sex is best left between two people who love each other.  
<LI>can get new ideas and fantasize without risking anything
<LI>I haven't been lucky enough to find any good pornographic pictures on the net.  All I hear is everybody else finds it and I can't .  There should be some info service that tells anyone looking for sexual videos or pictures how to find it  Thanks
<LI>I think it is fun for adults only.
<LI>As a sex writer on the net, I believe that humor and honesty is the best approach in ANY subject matter. I relay experiences (personal and those related to me from friends and outside sources and none of it (in my mind, at least) can be construed as offen
<LI>There is no such thing...while there is sexual material on the internet, don't confuse the internet as being sexual..if u do, u have problems!!
<LI>i've really enjoyed having net sex. it has tranlated into much better sex with my partner and we both are enjoying the new change.
<LI>i like it
<LI>it's great
<LI>Sex and th Internet? That's an oxymoron.
<LI>Its an improper forum.  The internet should promote morality not sexuality.
<LI>time consuming
<LI>I feel that the internet is a WONDERFUL way to meet people and practice safe sex.  Much of the posted erotica is highly stimulating and fairly easy to access, considering I never have to leave my home to get it.
<LI>I think that minors should not have easy access to it.
<LI>it is very intriguing, would like to experience cybersex
<LI>Whoever wants porn can find it. Why restrict it here? It's no different than picking up a magazine in the store. When the parents are into it, the children will find out. If it's restricted here it must be restricted everywhere. Parents: keep your kids out of the back of the closet where your mags. & videos are & keep an eye on you children when they are on the net.
<LI>I am horney
<LI>Over-rated!  People must understand that this is done by many, and hasn't hurt anyone yet.  Pornography is just Pictures, it's art.  Just like art stimulates you visually and mentally, so does pornography.  
<LI>It helps when I need it.
<LI>too censored
<LI>I am against censorship on the net.  Children should be supervised by their parents while they are on the net.
<LI>The media in America has over blown this subject and it has gotten very old, "cyber-sex" and "porn on the `net" are just a bunch of rubbish. I'm sick of the American public being spoon-fed everything they should thin from the media. It makes me sick...
<LI>it provides a specail service!
<LI> Internet is a very hot place. I like it !!!
<LI>I think sex is a natural part of human existance.  Nature is a very diverse thing and therefore so are things that are a product of nature.  Therefore different people have different thoughts on what is or is not ok sexually.  My feeling is that as long as they are not hurting another person, what two or more consenting adults do or talk about doing is none of any other person's business.  If diverse sexual topics are not of interest to you, then you should not be looking for them on the net.  For thoe
 people that are interested, there should not be censorship!!!
<LI>Sex on the Net, while I haven't experienced it, can in no way, shape, or form be as good as it is with my current partner. I only hope that whoever is reading this sentence has a partner 25% as good as mine......then they'd never even know what the hell the Net is (sexually speaking).
<LI>I cannot imagine how repressed and angry one would have to be to want to deny even adults access to what is, after all, a perfectly legitimate adult interest. Parents do need to have the option of guiding their childrens' exposure to sexual material on th
<LI>I've already said sex is ok as long as there are safeguards
<LI>No Answer
<LI>I think its fine!!! Cybersex is the safest sex for kids!!! 
<LI>It is a place for the curious to search/discuss/ and maybe meet others of similar tastes.
<LI>Fantaballistic!!!
<LI>I think it's overrated.  Real life is a WHOLE lot better
<LI>I would like to find someone to have sex with online.
<LI>Hey, it's safer than anyother kind of SEX around!
<LI>Alot of bait and switch techniques are used to get you to join certain clubs.  Most of them are a rip off !
