<h3 align=center>ROSEN MOTORS DEVELOPS<br>
HYBRID ELECTRIC POWERTRAIN FOR AUTOMOBILES<br>
First Major Change to Internal Combustion Engine in 110 Years</h3>
<p>WOODLAND HILLS, CALIF. -- Sept. 13, 1996 -- Rosen Motors announced today the development of an innovative 
hybrid electric powertrain for automobiles, the first to successfully use a flywheel-turbine combination. The Rosen 
TurboFlywheel simultaneously promises unusually long range, nearly zero emissions and sports car-like acceleration, a 
combination of characteristics that neither conventional internal combustion-powered cars nor battery-powered cars can offer.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the key to the 21st century automobile,&quot; said Benjamin M. Rosen, co-founder and chairman of Rosen Motors. &quot;This 
`mean, lean and green&#153;' powertrain is the first major shift in automobile technology since the invention of the internal 
combustion engine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are the leader in developing the world's first practical solution to the most challenging problems confronting automobile 
manufacturers: how to meet stringent future clean air laws around the world and significantly improve fuel efficiency without 
sacrificing performance,&quot; said Harold A. Rosen, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Rosen Motors. In fact, 
the Rosen approach will enhance performance substantially in terms of acceleration and range.</p>
<p>The Rosen powertrain is currently being tested in a passenger car on a dynamometer. Ultimately, Rosen Motors expects that 
cars powered by the Rosen TurboFlywheel will produce emissions that are no greater than those caused by battery-powered 
cars recharged by fossil-fuel-burning utilities. Yet these Rosen-powered cars, depending on their weight and aerodynamics, 
will enjoy a range of 45 to 80 miles per gallon. In addition, they will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in six to seven seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the most extraordinary aspects of this powertrain is the simplicity it will bring to the car. The turbogenerator has only 
one moving part, eliminating the need for a conventional radiator and a mechanical transmission. It's also maintenance-free, 
except for the need for an occasional air filter change,&quot; said Harold Rosen.</p>
<p>The Rosen hybrid electric powertrain is not simply a range extender for a battery-powered vehicle, but selects the ideal blend 
of flywheel and turbine-generated power for the optimal driving of a gasoline-fueled car. The flywheel produces surge power 
for acceleration and absorbs energy from regenerative breaking for later reuse. In today's vehicles, all the energy used in 
braking is irrevocably lost to heat.</p>
<p>The TurboFlywheel powertrain will not compromise the comfort or convenience of today's automobiles. This sets apart the 
Rosen technology from many other proposed &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;high efficiency&quot; engines that often burden cars with cramped 
passenger cabins, heavy batteries, multi-hour recharging times and the need for nonstandard fuels. The Rosen system will also 
enable consumers to use existing gasoline stations just as they do now.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers around the world will be able to drive super clean cars as soon as the first Rosen-powered autos are available,&quot; 
said Harold Rosen. &quot;You just fill it up with unleaded gasoline from your neighborhood gas station and go.&quot;</p>
<p>Benjamin M. Rosen and his brother, Dr. Harold A. Rosen, started Rosen Motors in 1993 after each had many years of 
success in technology venture capital and communications engineering, respectively. &quot;We wanted to help change the world just 
one more time,&quot; said Ben Rosen.</p>
<p>Ben Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer and chairman of Sevin Rosen Funds, a venture capital firm, was listed by 
Computerworld magazine in 1992 as one of 25 people in the computer industry who &quot;changed the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Harold Rosen, a pioneer in communications technology, is recognized as the father of the geostationary communications 
satellite, the world's first practical commercial communications satellite. He has won numerous prestigious engineering awards 
in many countries, including the Draper Prize in 1995, the world's top award in engineering.</p>
<p>Ben and Harold Rosen are also directors of <a href="http://www.capstoneturbine.com/">Capstone Turbine Corporation</a>, which supplies the gas-turbine generator, one of 
the key elements of the Rosen Motors powertrain. Capstone Turbine is a developer of small gas turbine-driven electric 
generators (turbogenerators) for both vehicular and stationary power.</p>
<p>Rosen Motors is a privately funded developer of hybrid electric powertrains for automobiles and flywheel systems for 
stationary power applications. The company's offices are located in Woodland Hills, Calif. Rosen Motors was founded in 
1993 and has approximately 60 employees.</p>
