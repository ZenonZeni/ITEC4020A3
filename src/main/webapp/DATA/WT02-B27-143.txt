<a name="bland">
<P>In March 1993 <B>Anthony Bland</b> had lain in persistent vegetative state for three years
before a Court Order allowed his degradation and indignity to come to a merciful
close. The judges said that if he had made a living will expressing his future wishes he
could have been allowed to die in peace earlier. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia
Society is at the forefront of living will research in the UK. Your subscription will
help to make a peaceful death through a living will a reality for anyone who desires
it.
<a name="cox">
<P>In 1992 <b>Dr Cox</b> openly defied the law and assented to 70 year old Mrs Boyes'
persistent request for voluntary active euthanasia. Mrs Boyes' was so ill that she
"screamed like a dog" if anyone touched her. Conventional medicine did not relieve
her agony. In her last days, when she repeatedly requested to die, Dr Cox finally gave
her an injection of potassium chloride, bestowing on her the boon of a peaceful death
so many of us feel we are entitled to. Dr Cox, although given a suspended sentence,
was hauled through the courts like a common criminal. We believe good doctors
acting in all conscience like Dr Cox, should be lauded, not vilified, and should have
the benefit of legally approved codes of conduct that embody consistent safeguards
against abuse. Together we should ensure that medicine and the law serve the patient
and the citizen once more. Together, we can stand and be counted. And, from pooled
resources, each small contribution will contribute to the powerful tidal wave that the
Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society can use to bring this about.
<a name="sr">
<P><B>Sue Rodriguez</B>, a mother in her early thirties, died slowly of Lou Gehrig's disease. She
lived for several years with the knowledge that her muscles would, one by one, waste
away until the day came when, fully conscious, she would choke to death. She begged
the Courts to reassure her that a doctor would be allowed to assist her in choosing
the moment of death. They refused. She lived on in terror, helped eventually by a
doctor who, in February 1994, covertly broke the law to help her die in peace. A law
on assisted suicide with rigorous safeguards could have saved her the nightmare during
those months before her death, given her the confidence to carry on - with the
reassurance that when it got too bad she could rely on a compassionate doctor to
follow her wishes at the end. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is pledged to
support research for drafting the most thorough, yet feasible, assisted suicide Bill yet
presented to Parliament. Your support will make it happen.
<a name="re_c">
<P><B>"Mr C"</B>, a 68 year old prisoner of Jamaican origin had been diagnosed as suffering from
chronic paranoid schizophrenia and was treated with drugs and electro-convulsive
therapy. In September 1993 the prison doctors found he had gangrene in his right
leg. They felt his chance of survival with conventional treatment was no better than
15%, and so recommended that his leg be amputated below the knee. The prisoner
refused amputation and received conventional treatment only. There was a likelihood,
however, that gangrene would recur. The prisoner stated he would rather die on two
legs than live on one, and his solicitor asked the hospital to promise not to amputate
in any circumstances without the prisoner's consent. They refused, and he sought a
court injunction to uphold his wishes. The court considered expert testimony in the
case (known as <B>Re C</B>) and found that, although the prisoner was suffering from
schizophrenia, there was nothing to suggest that he did not understand the nature,
purpose and effects of treatment; he had understood, and, with a full knowledge that
death might result from refusing amputation, had clearly made his choice. The court
upheld the prisoner's right to make an advance refusal of treatment and granted an
injunction. The case paved the way for acceptance of advance refusals of medical
treatments and so for living wills. Completion of a Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia
Society living will document could save distressing and drawn-out court proceedings if
ever you were incapacitated.
<a name="quinlan">
<P><B>Karen Ann Quinlan</b> collapsed on April 15th, 1975. She was twenty-one years old.
Within hours, she entered a coma from which she could never recover. Her parents,
staunch Roman Catholics, knew their daughter would not want to be kept alive by
extraordinary means. A year later, as Karen lay in a "persistent vegetative state," the
courts finally allowed her treatment to be stopped; but artificial feeding was
continued and she was maintained as a living corpse until June 1985, when she
eventually died of pneumonia. Her case spurred thousands of letters of sympathy and
fuelled the "right to die" movement. How many people need to die degrading deaths
before society learns a little humanity? The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is
committed to research and teaching in these difficult areas. Help us to help you, and
all those who would seek die with dignity and give you their heartfelt thanks.
<a name="rs">
<P><B>Ramon Sanpedro</b> is currently seeking, through the courts, the assistance of a doctor
to help him die with dignity. He was paralysed in Spain as a result of a swimming
accident during his youth. He describes himself as "a head attached to a corpse." He
writes:
<BR>"Why die? Because every journey has its departure time and only the traveller has the
privilege and the right to choose the last day to get out. Why to die? Because at times the
journey of no return is the best path that reason can show us out of love and respect for
life, so that life may havea dignified death."
<BR>Ramon Sanpedro makes no suggestion as to what the wishes of others in a similar
physical condition might be. In fact, some people who are so paralysed take
enjoyment in life and want to go on living. Their choice should be respected and they
should be given every support. But Ramon Sanpedro has made his choice and his
choice should also be respected. We should seek to ensure that the rights of the
individual are always respected without allowing others to feel endangered or
pressurised. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society provides international technical
and informational support. With your help, we can make the world a better place.
<a name="cruzan">
<P><B>Nancy Cruzan</b> lost control of her car one day in January 1983 in Missouri. When the
paramedics arrived, they were able to restore her breathing and heartbeat and she was
transported, unconscious, to hospital. She continued to be fed through a surgically-
implanted gastrostomy tube. After several years, a court found that, although her
respiration and circulation continued unaided, she was oblivious to her surroundings
except for reflexive responses to sound and perhaps painful stimuli; her brain had
degenerated, irreversibly; she was a spastic quadriplegic; she suffered contraction of
her four extremities, with irreversible muscle and tendon damage; and had no
cognitive or reflex ability to swallow food or water or to maintain her essential daily
needs nor would she ever recover such an ability. She lay in persistent vegetative state
even though she had told her housemate that, if sick or injured, she would not wish
to continue her life unless she could live "at least halfway normal." This was the first
time the U.S. Supreme Court had been faced with what we call the "right to die."
They said that Missouri had "arrogated to itself" the power to define life, and Nancy
Cruzan's life and liberty consequently put into disquieting conflict. She had not made
a living will, and the court case paved the way for a uniform, national Patient Self-
Determination Act that regulated living wills and made them more widely available.
The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is campaigning for uniform UK reform to
make living wills more widely available. Your help can make it a reality.
<a name="malette">
<P><B>57 year old Georgette Malette,</b> in the early afternoon of June 30th, 1979, was
rushed, unconscious, by ambulance, to hospital. The car in which she was a passenger,
driven by her husband, had collided with a truck. Her husband had been killed; she
had suffered serious injuries. She was a Jehovah's Witness and carried a card stating
her firm conviction that no blood or blood products should be administered to her
under any circumstances. The doctor treating her ignored the card and gave her a
blood transfusion which he decided was medically indicated. In June 1980 Mrs
Malette brought charges against Dr Shulman. The judge found that Mrs Malette had
suffered emotionally and mentally and ordered substantial costs to be paid. It made
no difference that the medical team didn't agree with her beliefs. Her advance refusal
of treatment was unambiguous. Unfortunately, living wills tend to be far less clear
cut, dealing with a wide range of circumstances in which interpretation is sometimes
necessary. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is at the forefront of research
into living wills and other ways of having your wishes respected at the end of life.
Public support will help us to help make dying more dignified for all those who want
to retain some control and self-respect in their dying phase.
<a name="conroy">
<P>When her case came to trial, <B>Claire Conroy</b> was unable to move from a semi-fetal
position. She was severely demented, had heart disease, hypertension and diabetes and
her left leg was gangrenous to the knee; she had sores, couldn't speak, had only a
limited ability to swallow, and had eye problems; she had a urinary catheter in place
and was unable to control her bowels. She was able to moan and scratch, and
occasionally smile when someone combed her hair. Claire Conroy eventually died
before the courts were able to decide what to do. She was not a candidate for
voluntary euthanasia. She had not made a living will. But her case posed very
worrying dilemmas about end of life decisions. Pushing difficult deaths to one side
will not make them go away or make them any easier. The Scottish Voluntary
Euthanasia Society encourages open discussion of the problems increasingly facing us
in society. We care, and we listen with an open mind. We ask you to work with us so
that every person can die with dignity in the way that he or she would choose.
