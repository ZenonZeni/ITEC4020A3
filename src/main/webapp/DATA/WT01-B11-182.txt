<B>MNR Urges Caution with Fireworks on Canada Day Weekend 
</B>

</CENTER><P>
Given the current serious forest fire situation in Northern Ontario, the Ministry of Natural Resources is asking the public to use caution when setting off fireworks this Canada Day weekend.<P>

"The forest fire situation in the north is serious enough to warrant the province's commitment of 4,100 firefighters and support staff to suppress the more than 175 forest fires currently burning," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We call upon people in communities with severe fire hazard conditions to use extreme caution if they decide to set off fireworks."<P>

Local municipal bylaws may apply regarding the setting off of fireworks.  Members of the public should contact their local municipality before planning any event using fireworks.  MNR is also reminding the public that they are responsible for any fire resulting from fireworks, and that they could be fined or charged under the Forest Fires Prevention Act if their actions result in a forest fire.<P> 

A Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ) will continue to be in effect in the West Fire Region over the Canada Day weekend, or until fire hazard conditions are significantly reduced.  The Restricted Fire Zone for the East Fire Region is scheduled to expire at midnight, June 26, 1996.<P>   

For the exact boundaries of these areas, the public should contact their local MNR office.<P>

Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including campfires.  The regulation does permit the use of a portable stove or charcoal installation but the public is asked to exercise caution.<P>
