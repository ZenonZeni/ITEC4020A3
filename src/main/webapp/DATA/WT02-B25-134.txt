<A NAME = "effex"><H2>EFFEXOR</H2></A>
<P>
What is Effexor?
<P>
Effexor (generic: venlafaxine) is the newest medication available
to treat depression.  Structurally different from any other
antidepressant, it affects two neurotransmitters (chemical
messengers in the brain) involved in depression: serotonin and
norepinephrine.  Approved for use in the United States at the end
of 1993, its novel chemical action and low incidence of side
effects make it a significant addition to the range of
medications used to treat depression.
<P>
How is Effexor different from other antidepressants?
Effexor is a chemically unique antidepressant medication.  Like
the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and
sertraline (Zoloft), it affects the absorption of serotonin.  In
addition, Effexor acts on the norepinephrine system.  No other
available medication affects both neurotransmitters without
causing the side effects of the older tricyclic antidepressants.
<P>
Are there other advantages of Effexor?
<P>
Effexor is less likely to induce seizures, to have toxic effects
on the heart, and to cause lethal reactions.  
<P>
For what kind of patient would Effexor be appropriate?
<P>
Effexor is recognized as an effective front-line option (i.e.,
first-time medication) for patients who have recently become ill
with depression, whether they are hospitalized or treated on an
outpatient basis.  It can also be useful for patients who have
had longstanding depressive illness and have not responded
adequately to previous treatments.  Almost 40 percent of
so-called refractory patients (those who have not had positive
results from past treatment) have had success with Effexor. 
Patients who have benefitted from other antidepressants but have
had less than complete success may want to discuss switching to
Effexor with their doctors.
<P>
What about side effects?
<P>
Relatively few side effects have been reported with Effexor. 
Those that have been noted are dose-related; that is, side
effects increase as the dose increases.  Very few patients have
had to discontinue the medication because of side effects.  
<P>
The most common minor side effects during clinical trials include
short-term nausea (which can be reduced by taking the medication
with food), sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation,
nervousness, sweating, weakness, ejaculation/orgasm problems, 
and loss of appetite. 
<P>
A small percentage (about five percent) of patients, usually
those taking higher doses, will develop elevated blood pressure. 
Therefore, patients taking Effexor should have their blood
pressure checked regularly.  Some agitation has been noticed at
higher dosages. 
<P>
How long does it take to work?
<P>
Like most other medications used for depression, Effexor may take
several weeks before it is fully effective.  It is important to
give the medication sufficient time before judging whether it
will work for a given person.  There is evidence, however, that
Effexor may take effect more quickly than other antidepressants.
<P>
Can Effexor be taken with other medications? 
<P>
Effexor does not interact significantly with many other
medications, including lithium, diazepam (Valium), and cimetidine
(Tagamet, an anti-ulcer medication). 
<P>
However, patients taking cimetidine who have high blood pressure
or liver disease or are elderly should use caution in taking
Effexor because the interaction may be more pronounced when these
disorders are present.
<P>
Effexor definitely should not be taken at same time as the MAOIs
(such as Parnate or Nardil). Interactions with these compounds
could be lethal.  Patients who have been taking an MAOI and
are switching to Effexor must allow sufficient time (usually 14
days) for the MAOI to clear out of the body.  The same time
should be allowed if changing from Effexor to an MAOI.  However,
switching from Effexor to other medications is easy because
Effexor is quickly removed from the body.
<P>
What is the standard dose?  
<P>
The dose range is generally between 75 and 375 mg per day.  The
average effective dose is about 125 to 150 mg per day.  Higher
doses are necessary for sicker patients.  It is recommended that
the total dose be divided into two or three doses per day and
taken with food.  Dosage adjustments for elderly people are not
usually necessary.  
<P>
Will Effexor work for everyone?
<P>
No.  Everyone responds to medications differently.  Effexor will
work well for some people, and not so well for others.  It is
important to give the medication a trial of several weeks and to
be in close communication with your doctor about signs of
effectiveness, side effects, and personal factors affecting one's
response to the medication.

<A NAME = "facts"><H2>FACTS ABOUT PAXIL</H2></A>
<P>
What is Paxil?
<P>
Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride), a new antidepressant
medication,was introduced into the United States in early 1993.  It
is a member of the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
family(along with Zoloft and Prozac).  These new medications
areeffective in alleviating the symptoms of major depression
without causing some of the harmful side effects caused by the
oldertricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).
<P>
What does Paxil treat?
<P>
Depression is a biologically based disorder, although social
and genetic factors may contribute to the illness.  Depression is
associated with a decreased number of neurotransmitters in the
brain (particularly serotonin and norepinephrine).  These chemical
messengers help regulate several functions and thoughts, including
mood.  Paxil blocks the reabsorption of serotonin and normalizes
the brain's chemical supply.
<P>
What are the advantages of Paxil over other antidepressants?
<P>
Paxil is as effective in relieving depression as TCAs such as
imipramine.  However, Paxil causes fewer adverse cardiovascular
and anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, blurred
vision, urinary retention) than the older TCAs.  It does not
usually cause drowsiness, low blood pressure, or weight changes. 
Paxil has no active metabolites and leaves one's system 24 hours
after it enters.  SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, which makes
Paxil, states that Paxil is the most selective of the
SSRI antidepressants.  This selectivity causes serotonin levels in
the brain to normalize quickly, relieving depression with
relatively few side effects. 
<P>
Who can benefit from taking Paxil?
<P>
Paxil is equally effective in elderly depressed patients as it is
in younger.  Elderly people may turn to Paxil for relief because
it does not cause significant changes in blood pressure,
unlike Effexor and some other antidepressants.
<P>
Paxil is effective in the treatment of anxiety which
accompanies depression in some people.  Those experiencing lethargy
at the beginning of treatment can also take Paxil with positive
results because Paxil does not impair psychomotor function.
<P>
What is the standard dose of Paxil?
<P>
The usual dose of Paxil is 20 mg taken once daily, usually in the
morning.  Paxil comes in either 20 mg tablets (pink) or 30 mg
tablets (blue).  For the depressed elderly, the recommended
starting dose is 10 mg once daily.  Physicians may change the dose
by 10 mg at a time and the dose should not exceed 50 mg per day
(40 mg in geriatric patients).  There should be a one week
interval between dose adjustments. 
<P>
Can I take Paxil with other medications?
<P>
Paxil should not be used while taking any MAOI (monoamine
oxidase inhibitor) medication.  The interaction between the two
could produce fatal results.  Therefore, there should be a fourteen
day interval between stopping the MAOI and starting Paxil, or vice
versa.
<P>
Patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and those taking
lithium should take Paxil with caution.  Other combinations of
medications require consultation with your doctor.  Alcohol
consumption is best avoided while one is taking Paxil.
<P>
What are the most common side effects of Paxil?
<P>
 For the most part, the side effects of Paxil are mild and brief.
The major side effect of Paxil is nausea, which can be reduced
by taking Paxil with food.  Side effects may include
drowsiness, asthenia (lack of physical strength) tremors,
nervousness, dizziness, insomnia, sweating, ejaculatory delay, and
other male genital dysfunction.  There may be a slight weight loss
associated with Paxil.  Only a small percentage of people have had
to discontinue their use of Paxil because of side effects.  
<P>
Women who become pregnant or who are nursing an infant
should iscuss with their doctors the effects of Paxil.  People
with kidney or liver dysfunction should use Paxil with caution. 
<P>
How soon will I feel better?
<P>
Most people will notice improvements within a week or two, but
it may take up to six weeks for the full therapeutic effect to
be realized.  Depressed mood, concentration problems, and
slowed activity improve in the first week, sleep disturbances
within the second week.  
<P>
How long should I stay on Paxil?
<P>
Paxil should be continued as directed by the prescribing physician. 
Paxil is effective in the treatment of both short-term and
long-term depression, and it can be beneficial in preventing
relapse into depression.  Studies have shown that Paxil is easily
tolerated for up to four years.  It is important to be in close
communication with the prescribing physician, and to promptly
report any unusual or distressing symptoms or side effects.
<P>
Is financial assistance available to those who cannot afford
treatment with Paxil?
<P>
The Paxil Access to Care program allows a physician to arrange
no- cost supplies of Paxil for patients who meet specific
requirements.  To be eligible, a patient must have an annual
household income of less than $25,000, have no medical insurance,
and be ineligible for government (such as Medicaid) or private
programs covering prescriptions.  A physician who believes that the
cost of Paxil would pose a significant hardship on a patient or
cause an inability to take the medication as prescribed can call
1-800-729-4544 to receive a Paxil Access to Care kit.

<A NAME = "helpi"><H2>HELPING CONSUMERS ACCEPT MEDS</H2></A>

<P>
Often stigma, side-effects, denial, and psychosis prevent consumers from accepting the treatments that could help.  These tips may help you, your relative, or your friend accept the help of medications and treatment.
<P>
1.  Start with the ill person's own agenda.  Take seriously what he or she says is right for his or her own life.
<P>
2.  Put treatment in the context of the person's life.  Be concrete about what can be gained by taking medications  ("You will be accepted back in school," or "You'll stop hearing those voices.")
<P>
3.  Involve the consumer as much as possible in decisions about his or her treatment.  Provide information about treatment options and resources that patients can use to solve problems and enhance their lives.
<P>
4.  Be concerned about whether he or she follows through with the agreed-on treatment plans.  Ask specific questions that will open dialogue, not put the person on the defensive.  (Don't ask, "Why didn't you take your meds?"  Ask "How much medication do you have left?")
<P>
5.  Make sure consumers, their families, and involved agencies are informed about the treatment options and plans.  Be sensitive to the agendas and prejudices of all persons and try to work with them.
<P>
6.  Be willing to involve friends, families, landlords, clergy, and others as confidentiality allow and as it fits into the consumer's own goals and agendas.  People in support systems have considerable influence over consumers' decisions.
<P>
7.  Be willing to be tenacious when necessary.  Be flexible about how you can engage consumers.  If they decline meds or treatment, focus on "safe" topics first.
<P>
8.  If warranted, connect medication compliance with continued community involvement.  It may be necessary to link medication use with the needs of the consumer, such as obtaining spending money.
<P>
9.  Accept the fact that some people may refuse treatment--or parts of treatment--despite your efforts.  Offer whatever you can--a walk, a talk, a movie, or lunch.  Consumers may be more willing to comply with treatment when a relationship is well established.
<P>
10.  Plan for and anticipate crises.  Use them to build trust. Follow through with promises to strengthen the therapeutic alliance.

<A NAME = "howne"><H2>HOW NEW MEDICATIONS ARE APPROVED</H2></A>

<P>
The following are the steps taken when new medications are approved for physicians to prescribe to the American public.  The information is from the NARSAD Research Newsletter, summer 1994.
<P>
Preclinical testing - A pharmaceutical company conducts laboratory and animal studies to show biological activity of the compound against the targeted disease, and the compound is evaluated for safety.  These tests take approximately three and one-half years.
<P>
Investigational new drug application (IND) - After completing preclinical testing, the company files and IND with the FDA to begin to test the drug in humans.  The IND becomes effective if the FDA does not disapprove it within 30 days. 
<P>
The IND shows results of previous experiments; how, where, and by whom the new studies will be conducted; the chemical structure of the compound; how it is thought to work in the body; any toxic effects found in the animal studies; and how the compound is manufactured.  In addition, the IND must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board where the studies will be conducted, and progress reports on clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
<P>
Clinical trials, phase I - These tests take about a year and involve about 20 to 80 normal, healthy volunteers.  The tests study a drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range.  The studies also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted, and the duration of its action.
<P>
Clinical trials, phase II -  In this phase, controlled studies of approximately 100 to 300 volunteer patients (people with the disease) assess the drug's effectiveness.  These studies take about two years.
<P>
Clinical trials, phase III -  This phase lasts about three years and usually involves 1,000 to 3,000 patients in clinics and hospitals.  Physicians monitor patients closely to determine efficacy and to identify adverse reactions.
<P>
New Drug Application (NDA) -  Following the completion of all three phases of clinical trials, the company analyzes all the data and files an NDA with the FDA if the data successfully demonstrate safety and effectiveness.  By law, FDA is allowed six months to review an NDA.   In almost all cases, the period between the first submission of an NDA and final FDA approval exceeds that limit.  The average NDA review time for new molecular entities approved in 1993 was 26.5 months.
<P>
Approval -  Once the FDA approves the NDA, the new medicine becomes available for physicians to prescribe.  For some medications, FDA requires additional studies (phase IV) to evaluate long-term effects.
<P>



<A NAME = "lower"><H2>LOWER INCIDENCE OF AGRANULOCYTOSIS</H2></A>

<P>
Study results reported in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine found a less than one percent incidence of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis--a potentially fatal blood disorder associated with clozapine therapy--compared to an expected incidence of one percent to two percent. 
<P>
Measuring the rates and development of agranulocytosis, the study of 11,500 patients was conducted by the drug manufacturer Sandoz and researchers at Hillside Hospital Division of Long Island Jewish Medical Center, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

<P>
MTH (methamphetamine) is infrequently researched as a treatment option for childhood attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), even though it has FDA-approved labeling for the disorder.  The may be due to MTH's reputation for high abuse liability.

<A NAME = "newth"><H2>NEW THERAPY FOR MANIC DEPRESSION</H2></A>

<P>
On February 6, the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended approval of divalproex sodium--Depakote, made by Abbott Laboratories--for the treatment of manic episodes of bipolar disorder or manic depression.  It would be the first new drug for that illness since the introduction of lithium 25 years ago. 
<P>
While the Food and Drug Administration is not obligated to follow advisory committee rulings, it usually does.  The Advisory Committee found that the evidence provided from Abbott's well-controlled clinical trials was sufficient to conclude that divalproex sodium is safe and effective for the treatment of manic episodes of bipolar disorder.

<A NAME = "proza"><H2>PROZAC</H2></A>

<P>
Commonly Asked Questions About Prozac
<P>
Q1. I've heard a lot about Prozac recently. What is Prozac and
why has it attracted so much attention?
<P>
Al. Prozac is a new antidepressant which has quickly become one
of the most widely-prescribed medications on the market.
<P>
It is used primarily to treat serious depressive disorders (which
cause problems in thinking, concentrating, and decision making;
excessive fatigue; loss of self esteem; inappropriate feelings
of unworthiness and guilt; loss of interest and pleasure in usual
activities, and sleep and appetite disturbances).
<P>
It may also be prescribed for chronic depressive disorder
(dysthymia), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia
nervosa, and panic/agoraphobia syndrome.
<P>
Q2. Why would my doctor think Prozac was better for me than one
of the older, more established antidepressants?
<P>
A2. Prozac is popular because it is effective in relieving
symptoms of depression with fewer, milder side effects than other
antidepressants. It does not cause dry mouth or weight gain, and
may cause a slight weight loss
<P>
A special diet is not necessary as with other antidepressants
(those known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs, e.g. Nardil
and Parnate). Doctors may feel more comfortable prescribing it
because a substantial overdose is not likely to be fatal.
<P>
Prozac may be especially suitable for elderly patients, because
it is less likely to cause sleepiness, irregular heartbeat, or
low blood pressure, which may lead to a fall in an elderly
patient.
<P>
Side effects that may occur -- primarily anxiety or nervousness,
insomnia or drowsiness, headache, diarrhea, and rash -- subside
in a few weeks in some people.
<P>
Agitation usually subsides in 24-48 hours. Sleep problems may be
alleviated by taking the medication in the morning or before 3:00
pm. If this does not work, a sleep medication may also be
prescribed.
<P>
Smaller numbers of people may find Prozac  inappropriate because
it inhibits orgasm or causes craving for alcohol.
<P>
Prozac has been known to trigger manic episodes in people with a
personal and/or family history of bipolar disorder. This is also
true of other antidepressants.
<P>
Q3. I've heard that Prozac causes people to think about suicide.
Isn't this pretty serious?
<P>
A3. Some people claim that Prozac has caused suicide or violent
behavior. Unfortunately, it's difficult to determine whether
Prozac was actually to blame. Clearly, millions of people are
successfully taking Prozac without this effect.
<P>
As with any medication, psychiatric or other, most people will
experience the desired effect, but a few may have an unusual
reaction.
<P>
Doctors and patients must be in close communication about any
adverse effects. Let Your doctor know if you feel worse on Prozac
or experience any symptoms with which you are uncomfortable.
<P>
If Prozac should be unsuitable for you, there are many other
antidepressants with established track records that can be
tried. Most antidepressants can lead a patient to consider
suicide in the early stages of recovery as the depression lifts
and the patient becomes mobilized.
<P>
Q4. How soon after starting Prozac will I feel better?
<P>
A4. You may notice some improvement within a few days.
particularly improved concentration and increased energy. As with
other antidepressant drugs, it may take three to six weeks for
the full effect to be felt.
<P>
The medication should be tried at the prescribed dose for the
full six weeks before evaluating its effectiveness.
<P>
It's important to remember that Prozac is not a cure-all. It can
relieve symptoms of clinical depression in some people, but not
in all people, and it will not make other life problems go away.
<P>
Q5. Is Prozac expensive?
