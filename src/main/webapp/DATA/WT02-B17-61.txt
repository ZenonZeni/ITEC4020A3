<H2>Energy-Efficient Government Purchasing</H2>
<strong>Overview</strong>
</center>
<br clear=all>
<br>
<P>
<B>One important but little</B> used market-based strategy to advance
energy efficiency uses a government's own buying-power as a source of
leverage to open up new markets for efficient products, bring down
prices through volume purchasing, and at the same time significantly
reduce the cost of government operations.  Government purchasing can
also be a foundation for broader aggregation of demand that can
transform markets. The government's energy efficiency purchase
specifications can be shared with other large institutional and private
sector buyers--and with individual consumers.  Perhaps most important,
implementing energy efficiency through the purchasing process utilizes
operating funds that would be spent anyway, without the need for major
new sources of capital.</P>
<P>The following sections summarize
energy-efficient purchasing activities in the U.S., practical issues,
and sources of information.  Readers are encouraged to <A HREF="mailto:JPHarris@lbl.gov"
>contribute information</A> from their own countries on energy-efficient
purchasing practices underway or planned.</P>
