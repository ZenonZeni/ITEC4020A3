<h2>Husband's Sperm</h2>

<dt>Definition:  
<dl>Artificial insemination is the process of taking the husband's semen obtained by masturbation and placing it by artificial means into one of the following:</dl>

<dl><dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">  Into the cervical mucus: cervical insemination.
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">  Through the cervix into the uterine cavity:  intrauterine insemination.
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">  Through the cervix and uterine cavity into the fallopian tube:  intratubal insemination.</dl>

Intracervical insemination is performed by placing an "unprocessed" semen specimen into the cervical mucus and then placing a cervical cap or specially designed vaginal tampon to hold the semen against the cervix.  Success rates with intracervical insemination have varied widely, but unfortunately, only 10 to 15% of couples will obtain a pregnancy following 4 to 6 well timed cycles of insemination.  <p>


Intrauterine insemination was developed in an attempt to improve the chance of pregnancy.  Intrauterine insemination involves both  a special processing of the semen to maximize its fertility potential and its placement into the uterine cavity.  Thus the maximum number of sperm are placed in close proximity to the egg.  Recent scientific studies found a significantly increased number of patients had living sperm within the fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavity surrounding the ovary following intrauterine insemination.  Couples underwent either intracervical or intrauterine insemination 2 to 4 hours prior to a laparoscopy.  At laparoscopy, fluid from the peritoneal cavity was sampled for the presence of live sperm.  He found live sperm 50% of the time following intracervical insemination and 85% of the time following intrauterine insemination.  Undoubtedly this is only 1 element involved in the establishment of pregnancy, but considering the magnitude of differences between the 2 routes (intracervical versus intrauterine insemination) one can justify intrauterine insemination as a clinical treatment.<p>


The placement of sperm into the uterine cavity involves a special processing procedure of the semen sample.  The seminal fluid that contains the sperm does not normally pass the cervical mucus barrier and gain access to the uterine cavity.  Thus it is generally best not to artificially place the seminal fluid into the uterine cavity.  The first step of the semen processing procedure is to separate the sperm from the seminal fluid so that only the sperm are placed beyond the cervical mucus into the uterine cavity.  Secondly, the semen processing procedure is performed to maximize the husband's fertility potential.  In some cases the artificial insemination is performed to overcome a sperm abnormality.  A semen processing procedure is selected which will attempt to specifically improve upon the identified abnormality.  The exact type of semen processing will be individualized after the best technique has been determined for the husband.  He will be given specific instructions on how to collect the semen sample and what particular semen preparation procedure we will utilize.<p>


Once a couple has entered the insemination program the semen samples will be monitored carefully at each insemination procedure and we will make any necessary adjustments in either collection or processing.  A detailed assessment of each semen sample allows us to adjust, if necessary, any factors that may maximize your overall chance of pregnancy. <p>
 

Kerin and Associates performed a randomized clinical trial of artificial insemination.  In this study 30 couples, all of whom have been attempting pregnancy for at least 3 years were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments:<p>
<ol>

<li>A single timed intercourse on the day of ovulation as predicted by temperature charts.<p>


<li>A single timed intercourse on the day of ovulation as predicted by ovulation predictor kits (LH surge).<p>


<li>A single intrauterine insemination on the day of ovulation as determined by ovulation predictor kits (LH surge).<p></ol>

Less than 3% of the timed intercourse cycles resulted in pregnancy while 9 of 39 intrauterine inseminations resulted in pregnancy (23%).<p>

Intratubal insemination  has been investigated in an attempt to improve upon the success rates already obtained by intrauterine insemination.  The same processing techniques as used for intrauterine insemination separates the sperm from the seminal fluid and maximizes the sperm's  fertility potential.<p>



Intratubal insemination, however, involves a more difficult and involved technique of placing the sperm.  This requires the use of a specially designed catheter that is placed through the cervix, into the uterine cavity, and into the uterine opening  of the fallopian tube.  This is technically a much more difficult procedure than intrauterine insemination and may carry with it more risk.  The use of hysteroscopy or ultrasound is necessary to guide the catheter appropriately into the fallopian tube. Unfortunately, studies have not demonstrated an significant improvement in pregnancy rates with this technique.<p>


In couples where the husband has very low sperm count or motility this technique may possibly improve the odds of pregnancy more significantly than intrauterine insemination.  There is also the possibility that this method may be superior to intrauterine insemination in couples where a strong antisperm antibody is suspected.  At this point, intratubal insemination is investigational, but the initial results are encouraging.<p>



<h2>Clinical indications for intra-uterine insemination.</h2>

<b>A. Cervical factors</b><br><ol>

<li>Mucus - poor quality and/or quality<p>


Good cervical mucus should change its physical characteristics so that it can store, mature, and transport sperm from the cervix where it is deposited to the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs.  Abnormalities in the production of "fertile" cervical mucus are sometimes correctable with medical treatment.  When medical treatment fails to normalize cervical mucus production, intrauterine insemination is utilized to bypass the cervical mucus and place the sperm directly into the uterine cavity.<p>


<li>Anatomic - Stenosis<p>


The cervical openings can sometimes be excessively narrowed, causing a "stenotic cervix".  This is usually a result of a prior surgical procedure performed on the cervix such as a conization, but it can also occur after vaginal delivery, or in some cases be congenital in origin.  Cervical stenosis can result in poor mucus production and decreased sperm transport.  If an insemination devise can be passed through the narrowed cervix, this problem can be bypassed.<p>


<li>Immunologic - presence of antibodies directed against sperm<p>


A woman's body does not normally make antibodies that are specifically targeted towards killing or immobilizing sperm.  As part of our natural defense mechanism
we develop an immune response to foreign material such as viruses and bacteria which allows us to fight off infections.  Part of this immunological response is the making of a specific antibody that is targeted towards the bacteria, virus, or foreign tissue.  The antibody is manufactured by our white blood cells.  Although sperm are foreign cells to a women's body, they do not usually trigger an immunological response.  In some instances however, for reasons that are unclear, some women develop an immunological response that produce antibodies directed against sperm.  These antibodies may appear in the blood, tubal fluid, uterine fluid, or cervical mucus.  When these antibodies occur in the woman's reproductive tract they can immobilize and kill the sperm before they have a chance to reach the egg within the fallopian tube.<p>


A number of therapies have been proposed to overcome antisperm antibodies:<p>
<dl>

<dt>Condom Therapy

<dd>The use of condoms limits the exposure of sperm to the female genital tract, hopefully reducing the stimulus to produce further antibodies. This does not appear to be successful.  It is only applicable for sperm antibodies in the women.<p>
 

<dt>Steroid Therapy


<dd>The use of high dose steroids (cortisone-like medication) suppresses the immunological system and decreases all antibody formation. This technique has resulted in serious side effects and is rarely recommended.<p>


<dt>Intrauterine Insemination


<dd>Placement of a large number of sperm within close proximity to the egg, bypassing cervical mucus antibodies. <p>


<dt>Intratubal Insemination


<dd>Placement of a large number of motile sperm at the point of fertilization within the fallopian tube bypassing the cervical mucus and uterine fluid which may contain antisperm antibodies.<p>


<dt>Assisted Reproductive Technology (Gamete intrafallopian tube transfer, In Vitro Fertilization, etc.)


<dd>Placing sperm and egg with direct contact with each other, thus minimizing the effects of antibodies in all areas of the reproductive tract.<p>
</dl></ul></ol>

Short of the assisted reproductive technologies, intrauterine insemination has been shown to be the most effective mode of therapy.  Experimental evidence has indicated that antisperm antibody levels tend to be the highest concentration within the cervical mucus.  Bypassing the cervical mucus, therefore, places the maximum number of sperm beyond its biggest barrier.   Antibody concentrations with the uterine fluid and fallopian tube fluid are often not great enough to immobilize all of the sperm if sufficient numbers are placed in the uterine cavity.  Thus, placement of a large number of motile sperm within the uterine cavity offers the advantages.  Intratubal insemination is presently under investigation with the hopes that this will further improve results by placing the sperm even closer to the point of fertilization.  Intratubal insemination, however, is technically more difficult, expensive and possibly may carry a greater risk of complications.<p>


<b>B.  Male factors</b><br>

<ul><li>Sperm quality - Defects in sperm production such as decreased sperm count and/or diminished sperm motility.<p>


Any sperm production problem that results in a decreased number of normal motile sperm can result in a decreased male fertility potential.  A normal ejaculate contains millions of normally formed motile sperm.  It is estimated that following intercourse only a few hundred sperm make it to the point of fertilization.  This is because the vast majority of sperm are lost from their point of deposition in the vagina as they make their way up the reproductive tract to the point of fertilization in the fallopian tube.  When a decreased number of normally functioning sperm are ejaculated into the vagina during intercourse there is a decreased chance that an adequate number of normal spermatozoa will reach the crucial point of fertilization by providing an increased number of sperm in closer proximity to the egg.  Although insemination procedures can provide an increased number of sperm at the fertilization site, the sperm reaching the egg must be able to penetrate and fertilize the egg.  Insemination procedures can not improve the chance of pregnancy if the sperm are unable to fertilize the egg.  The ability to improve fertility through  artificial insemination is highly depended upon the sperm defect and its severity.<p>


<li>Immunological - sperm directed autoantibodies in the male reproductive tract.<p>


Sperm are normally kept isolated from the male immunological system by the blood-testis barrier.  Under normal condition sperm within the male reproductive tract never stimulate the male immunological system to produce antibodies against sperm.  In certain situations however, this separation mechanism fails and sperm are exposed to the immunological system, stimulating the production of antisperm antibody.  The antibody is present in the seminal fluid which is mixed with the sperm at the time of ejaculation.  The antibody coats the sperm and can immobilize them, cause the sperm to react adversely to the cervical mucus, or disrupt their ability to penetrate the egg.  The process of intrauterine insemination of intratubal insemination attempts to select out those sperm that have not been coated with antibody and place as many as possible in close proximity to the egg.  The insemination procedure is sometimes coupled with steroid therapy in the male in order to decrease the amount of antibody production.<p>
  
<li>Ejaculatory<p>


Any sexual disfunction or ejaculatory abnormality that interrupts the normal placement of sperm during intercourse reduces the possibility of pregnancy.  Depending on the specific problem being treated, one of the artificial insemination procedures should be ideal for placing the sperm in the female reproductive tract.<p></dl></ul>

<b>
C.  Miscellaneous</b><br><ul><dl>



<li>Abnormal Huhner's Post Coital Test<p>


The post coital test is a clinical exam that checks for the number of motile sperm within the cervical mucus following intercourse.  A normal post coital test requires that an adequate number of motile sperm be deposited correctly during ejaculation and are able to survive for the appropriate length of time in the cervical mucus.  A normal post coital test is associated with a good fertility potential.  A poor post coital test often reflects a sperm production problem, sperm placement problem, or hostile cervical mucus.  A persistently abnormal post coital test is often an indicator for an artificial insemination procedure, regardless of the etiology.<p>


<li>Infertility of unclear ediology.<p>

Some couples remain infertile in spite of the fact that a complete infertility evaluation has not elucidated a clear cause for the infertility.  Many of these couples will be helped through intrauterine insemination alone or in combination with superovulation.  Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is thought that the placement of an increased number of motile sperm higher in the reproductive tract is responsible for the increased chance of pregnancy.  This may be because some patients have an undetectable abnormality in sperm transport from the cervix to the fallopian tube.<p>
</ul></ol><p>


<h2>Success of conception with artificial insemination</h2>

A cumulative pregnancy rate (the overall chance of a couple obtaining a pregnancy with four to six cycles of intrauterine insemination) averages about 25% (1 in 4 couples will achieve a pregnancy).  The result varies significantly however, depending on the reason that the insemination is being performed.  Male factor infertility with severe abnormalities and sperm count or motility have the worse prognosis with only 10 to 15% of couples achieving a pregnancy.  Male factor infertility with only moderate abnormalities, couples with cervical factor or immunological factor infertility has been shown to have the best prognosis with 35 to 40% of couples achieving a pregnancy.<p>


Unfortunately there is no direct correlation between the absolute values of sperm count, motility, morphology, and the chance of obtaining a pregnancy.  Certainly the more severe the sperm production abnormality, the less likely pregnancy will occur.  Pregnancy has been achieved with as few as 400,000 progressively motile sperm placed within the uterus at the time of insemination.  Thus it is usually impossible for the physician to give a specific percentage chance of success for a given couple.  If a minimum number of motile sperm are present most physicians will recommend a trial of intrauterine insemination as an appropriate course of therapy.  We recommend a 4 to 6 cycle trial of intrauterine insemination.  Most pregnancies that occur as a result of insemination do so in the first 4 cycles of therapy.  During those 4 cycles the chance of obtaining a pregnancy is about the same each cycle.  This means that the chance of becoming pregnant on the 3rd or 4th cycles is similar to the chance of obtaining a pregnancy on the 1st or 2nd cycle.  Beyond 4 cycles pregnancies are uncommon and beyond 6 cycles are highly unlikely.<p>


Because pregnancy rates vary considerably depending on a couple's individual situation your chance of success will have to be individualized.  Through your course of insemination therapy, every attempt will be made to maximize the chance of success by minimizing all other possible factors that may lesson fertility potential.  Care will be taken to individualize semen collection procedures, sperm preparation procedures, and the insemination technique to maximize results.  The semen specimen will be analyzed at each insemination procedure and all results monitored.  Intratubal insemination is presently being investigated to determine whether further improvement in pregnancy rates can be obtained by use of this technique.  Results are preliminary but there is a possibility that in certain situations intratubal insemination may offer a better chance of pregnancy than intrauterine insemination.<p>


<h2>Possible complications of intrauterine insemination.</h2>

Fortunately the side effects, adverse reactions, or possible complications from intrauterine insemination are infrequent and rarely severe.  All of the potential problems associated with intrauterine insemination are associated with the bypassing of the normal cervical mucus barrier to the female reproductive tract and the artificial placement of sperm beyond the cervical mucus.  The possible problems associated with artificial insemination can be categorized as follows:<p>

<ol><li>Uterine cramping<p>


Uterine cramping will occur in approximately 5% of all patients undergoing intrauterine insemination.  The suspected causes of uterine cramping are as follows:<p><dl>


<ul><li>Introduction of the catheter into the uterine cavity which may act as a foreign body causing a cramping reflex.<p>

<li>Disruption of a small portion of the endometrium (uterine lining) by the insemination cannula causing the release of prostaglandin (a hormone responsible for causing intrauterine cramps) leading to cramping 2 to 4 hours following the procedures.<p>


<li>Residual seminal fluid prostaglandins remaining in the semen despite the wash procedures resulting in cramping occurring within a few minutes following the actual insemination procedure.<p></dl></ul>


Uterine cramping is not a serious problem and can be easily treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication such as Anaprox.  It does not denote infection.<p>


<li>Mild spotting<p>


Mild spotting occurs in approximately 1% of the patients following intrauterine insemination.  This spotting is a result of minor irritation to the cervical glands caused by threading the insemination cannula through the cervical os into the uterine cavity.  This bleeding will usually subside without any treatment within several hours of the procedure.<p>

<li>Gastrointestinal Upset<p>


Mild nausea or diarrhea occur in approximately 0.5% of patients undergoing intrauterine insemination.  Like uterine cramping, this is usually secondary to the presence of prostaglandins which can be upsetting to the gastrointestinal tract.  This usually subsides within a few  hours of the insemination procedure.<p>


<li>Pelvic Infection<p>


The potentially most serious complication and fortunately the most infrequent, is infection.  In a recent study from the University of California at Irving, less than 0.2% of their patients developed pelvic infections following over 3,000 intrauterine inseminations during a 3 year period.  Most studies to date have shown less than 1% of couples experience pelvic infection following intrauterine insemination.  Although this complication is uncommon, if it occurs the results can be devastating.  An infection in the uterine cavity can spread to the fallopian tubes and the surrounding pelvic structures, which can lead to the need for hospitalization, and intravenous antibiotics.  The infection can cause permanent scarring within the fallopian tubes and surrounding structures, leaving a patient sterile.<p>


The reason for pelvic infection following intrauterine insemination is that the normal mucus barrier of the cervix is broken at the time of the placement of the catheter.  If an aggressive bacteria is present in the cervical mucus or in the sperm placed into the uterine cavity, infection may occur.  It appears that patients who have had previous pelvic infections or certain types of tubal surgery may be at increased risk of infection.  This increased risk is likely due to the decreased natural defense mechanisms resulting from previous tubal damage.  The use of artificial insemination in patients at increased risk for infection should be weighed carefully.  There are many times, however, when the potential benefit from intrauterine insemination in these patients outweighs the potential risk.<p>


The early symptoms of pelvic infection are cervical or uterine tenderness during intercourse, lower abdominal pain made worse by movement or activity, fever, and possibly a foul or bloody vaginal discharge.  If an infection follows artificial insemination, the symptoms generally begin within a few days to a week after the insemination procedure.  Should a patient who has undergone artificial insemination begin experiencing any symptoms of pelvic infection, they should notify their physician immediately and if infection is suspected, promptly start antibiotic therapy.<p>
</ol>

<h2>The Insemination Procedure</h2>


<b>Timing of the Insemination Procedure</b><br>

The proper timing of artificial insemination is vital when attempting to maximize success.  A number of techniques have been developed to insure optimum timing so that the sperm and egg will meet at the time of ovulation.<p>
<ol>

<li>Ovulation Predictor Kits<p>


Ovulation is triggered by the release of LH from the pituitary gland.  The ovulation predictor kits measure the presence of the LH hormone in the urine.  The daily measurement of urinary LH concentrations with the predictor kits will accurately predict ovulation in most patients.  We recommend that our patients test their urine  before noon.  When testing urine in this manner, most patients will ovulate in the morning following a positive test.  Although the ovulation predictor kits are expensive, they ultimately save money by eliminating the need for extra inseminations per cycle.  The improved accuracy of the insemination is also more likely to make it successful early in the treatment program, lessening the need for multiple insemination cycles.  The majority of patient will have their insemination timed in this manner.<p>
<li>Ultrasound Timing<p>


Some patients will be undergoing specialized ovulation induction treatment for the purpose of stimulating ovulation.  These patients often have ovulation triggered artificially with an injection of human chronic gonadotropin (HCG).  In this case the HCG is often administered in the early evening as directed by the physician with artificial insemination scheduled 36 to 40 hours after the injection.  The timing for insemination timing is a result of a slightly different timing of egg release that results from the use of HCG vs. the natural LH surge.<p></ol>


<b>Scheduling Artificial Insemination</b><br>

When you experience an LH surge please call Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre 265-3662 prior to 4:00 p.m.  You will need to tell the receptionist that you have surged and need an appointment for an insemination the following morning.  Inseminations are scheduled between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday.

If you surge over a weekend or on a holiday, please call the office number and have the answering service page the physician on call who will give you further instructions as to when to come in for your insemination.<p>
