<h3><b>Economic Growth</b></h3>
<br><br>
<img src="t.gif" align="left">he ethanol industry contributes positively to the U.S. economy, particularly rural communities where ethanol production is often based, by providing direct and indirect jobs and increasing corn prices and rural income. Increases in ethanol production offer enormous potential for overall economic growth and additional employment in these smaller communities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has concluded that a 100 million gallon ethanol facility could create 2,250 local jobs for a single community.
<br><br>
An economic outlook of the U.S. ethanol industry over the seven year period, 1996 to 2002, concluded:
<br><br>
<ul><li><b>Ethanol will add $51 billion (1996$) to the entire U.S. economy.</b><br>
The goods and services purchased by ethanol producers represent increased final demand for other industries. These include purchases of grain, natural gas, electricity, water and sewer, telephone, and accounting and legal services. Each of these supplier industries in turn purchase inputs from other industries.
<br><br>
<img src="economic.gif" align="right">
<li><b>Farm income for crop producers will be $2.2 billion, or nearly 3%, higher 
each year because of ethanol production.</b>
<br>Increased demand for grain grown by American farmers provides market support for prices and incomes.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Ethanol supports 55,000 jobs.</b><br>
Ethanol production directly accounts for over 5,800 jobs in the food/fuel processing industry in 17 states. Additionally, the spending of ethanol manufacturers on goods and services indirectly supports an average of 48,900 jobs annually throughout all other industries in the entire economy. Increases in ethanol production offer enormous potential for overall economic growth and additional employment in smaller communities where ethanol production is often based.<br><br>
<li><b>Ethanol production will increase total household income by $12.5 billion over the next seven years.</b><br>
The ethanol industry directly pays $277 million in wages to employees. These employees and their families spend this income, thereby creating demand. The indirect impact of ethanol production adds another $1.8 billion to household income annually.<br><br>
<li><b>Ethanol generates $555 million of net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury annually through personal and business income tax receipts.</b><br>
Additional revenues provided by taxes on household and farm income that are generated and supported by the ethanol industry offset the cost of the partial ethanol excise tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasolines.
</ul>

<h3><b>Trade</b></h3><br>
Ethanol contributes over $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance. By displacing imported MTBE, ethanol reduces the U.S. merchandise trade deficit by about $1.3 billion annually. But the trade implications of ethanol do not stop with MTBE. The majority of the by-products of ethanol production - corn gluten feed and gluten meal - are exported. This further reduces the trade deficit by earning over $800 million annually.
<br><br>
<h3><b>Budget Impact</b></h3><br>
Past analyses of the ethanol industry have concluded that the production of ethanol actually saves the federal government money in reduced farm program costs and increased rural income. The General Accounting Office concluded in 1995 that the reductions in farm program costs attributable to the increased demand for corn created by the ethanol industry more than offset the cost of the ethanol tax incentive. The historic farm bill passed in 1996 detaches farm program payments from production, a fundamental change in federal farm policy.  An economic analysis by AUS Consultants found that while the ethanol industry can no longer point to the budgetary savings of reduced farm program costs, the ethanol program will continue to save the government money because the industry generates considerable household and farm income that results in increased federal tax revenue.
