<P><B>Explanation of Services: </B><BR>

<P>HSLDA was founded in 1983 to bring together a large number of home schooling families so that each can have a low-cost method of obtaining quality legal defense.  We give families the freedom to home school without the fear of facing legal threats alone.<BR>

<P>The vast majority of the legal threats member families face are successfully resolved through our early intervention.  For those families who do end up in court, HSLDA provides full representation at every state of legal proceedings at no cost to the family.<BR>

<P>HSLDA's efforts on behalf of home schoolers go beyond defensive actions.  We have taken offensive action in prosecuting a number of federal civil rights actions for members at no additional charge.  HSLDA has also been able to assist a number of state organizations, upon their request, with legislative battles within their home states.  Additionally, our presence in the Washington, D.C. area has enabled us to track and become involved in federal legal developments of concern to home schoolers.<BR>

<P>Each year thousands of member families received legal consultation by letter and phone, hundreds more are represented through negotiations with local officials, and dozens are represented in court proceedings.<BR>

<P>** For more information about how your family can join HSLDA, please call or write, and we will be happy to send out an application.  HSLDA also provides a number of resources and materials, including books on home schooling, synopses of state laws, home education studies and statistics, high school diplomas, and more.  You do not have to be a member to order these items or to subscribe to HSLDA's bi-monthly publication, The Home School Court Report, which tracks state and federal legislative developments, new studies and statistics, and other home education-related news.<BR>

<P>The National Center for Home Education is a sister branch of HSLDA and serves as an information clearinghouse on heom education statistics, educational choice, educational legislation, state leadership, and more.  You can reach the National Center at 540-338-7600.
