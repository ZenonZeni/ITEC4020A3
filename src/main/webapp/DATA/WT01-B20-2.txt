<p align="center"><b>White House Unveils New Drug Strategy</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 29, 1996, Cora Gables, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Amidst a wave of media fanfare, President Clinton and Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey unveiled a new 10-year anti-drug strategy this
past Monday in Miami.&nbsp; The program asks for a record high
$15.1 billion budget to initiate a &quot;decade-long commitment&quot;
to reduce drug use in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both the President and the Drug Czar emphasized that the
new strategy is chiefly focused on &quot;motivat[ing] America's
youth to reject illegal drugs and substance abuse,&quot; a comprehensive
breakdown of the 1997 budget request illustrates that the plan's
largest component remains domestic law enforcement.&nbsp;
According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP),
the President is requesting $8.3 billion in fiscal year 1997 for
domestic enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, McCaffrey admitted that the new 1996 Clinton
anti-drug strategy is essentially the same as those of previous
administrations.&nbsp; &quot;Everything in this strategy is
already being done,&quot; he told reporters in Miami.&nbsp;
&quot;I don't think the drug strategy has new tricks in it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a follow-up conference this past Wednesday in Washington,
D.C., McCaffrey reiterated this point.&nbsp; This strategy
contains &quot;no sudden surprise attacks,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;[We] recognize that there is no silver bullet.&quot;&nbsp;
McCaffrey added that he sees the new approach as a
&quot;permanent commitment to young people&quot; and was
optimistic that &quot;there is no reason why we can't return
America to a ... pre-Vietnam era level of drug use.&quot;&nbsp;
When asked by the moderator what he felt about the idea of legalization,
McCaffrey called the notion &quot;nonsense.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The federal government's war on drugs has risen from a $1.5
billion yearly battle in 1981 to $15.1 billion battle
today.&nbsp; During that time, America has experienced millions
of casualties and very few gains,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The Clinton
administration's latest proposals are simply an escalation of the
same policies that resulted in the arrest of nearly one-half
million marijuana smokers in 1994 alone.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Judge Suspends Sentence Against
Quadriplegic<br>
Who Used Marijuana As Medicine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Toledo, OH:</b>&nbsp; Daniel
Asbury, a quadriplegic who grew marijuana to alleviate reoccurring
pain and muscle spasms, has been given a two-year suspended
sentence by Lucas County Court Judge Ruth Ann Franks.&nbsp;
Asbury, who was found guilty of trafficking in marijuana despite
expert testimony by <b>NORML</b> Board member Dr. John Morgan on
the use of marijuana and pain management, must now refrain from
using cannabis if he wants to stay out of jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This court does not condone the use of marijuana,&quot;
Franks said.&nbsp; &quot;This court has sent people to the
penitentiary for using marijuana.&nbsp; ... But I believe this is
a unique case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The evidence is clear that you were using this drug for
medicinal purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, any further use may land Asbury in jail.&nbsp;
&quot;Essentially, David Asbury's future -- like the futures of
the tens of thousands of patients who use marijuana as a medicine
-- is limited to two options: suffer in pain or risk arrest and
jail,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use
marijuana as a therapeutic agent after prescription drugs proved
ineffective at controlling his pain.&nbsp; &quot;I need it,&quot;
Asbury told the court.&nbsp; &quot;It's the only thing that makes
me feel better.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter's Marijuana Measure To Be
Placed On City Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 27, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
An initiative put forth by the Traverse City NORML chapter to
reduce marijuana penalties has the necessary number of signatures
to be placed on the city ballot.&nbsp; The petition seeks to make
possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce of marijuana in
Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of $100 and up to
ten hours of community service for a first-time offender. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot has been a rocky one for marijuana
activists.&nbsp; Chapter organizers' 1994 initiative drive was
rejected by the city commission despite having well over the
required number of signatures, because it allegedly conflicted
with state law.&nbsp; This year's petition was devoid of legal problems,
but faced severe opposition from city commissioners who in
December unanimously passed a resolution asking residents not to
sign the petition. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Bustance, president of the Traverse City NORML Chapter, told
local media that he feels that there is a good chance that the
measure will be approved by voters.&nbsp; &quot;We're just asking
a simple question,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;We're not asking:
'Are you for marijuana or are you against marijuana? or 'If
you're for <b>NORML</b> or against <b>NORML</b>?'&nbsp; ... We're
asking: 'Do you want to throw people in prison at a cost of
$30,000 per year or do you want to enact fines and community
service that will go directly to the community?&quot; <br>

City NORML @ (616) 264-9565.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Cincinnati Buyers Club Founder
Pleads Not Guilty To Felony Pot Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 29, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Buyers Club --
one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across the
country that supply marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously
ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation -- pled not
guilty on Monday to three felony counts of trafficking marijuana
within 1,000 yards of a school in connection with a February raid
by law enforcement officers on the club's headquarters.&nbsp;
Evans' home, which is located in close proximity of a school,
served as the headquarters for the Cincinnati club.&nbsp; Evans
informed <b>NORML</b> last February that he had two marijuana
seedlings growing at the time of the bust. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This case] will have national implications,&quot; stated
attorney and marijuana activist Gatewood Galbraith, one of three
lawyers representing Evans in the case.&nbsp; &quot;I think the
mood of the nation is: Why not let these people have their
medication.&quot;&nbsp; Galbraith maintains that he intends to
launch a full-scale attack on Kentucky's anti-marijuana laws. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The resolution of this case could set an example for all
legal treatment of Buyer's Clubs in the future,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this case, please contact Richard
Evans of Americans for Compassionate Use @ (606) 431-8719.&nbsp;
In addition, Gatewood Galbraith is asking for contributions to
help offset expenses associated with bringing in expert witnesses
such as NORML Board members Dr. Lester Grinspoon and Dr. John
Morgan to testify in this case.&nbsp; Mr. Galbraith may be
