TimeTech Investors is a division of Investment Perspectives Advisory
Corporation, an investment advisor which is registered with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisors Act
of 1940.</P>

<P>TimeTech Investors utilizes a computer methodology that analyzes price
changes of high yield bond mutual funds to determine whether to be invested in 
bond funds (which is constructive to earning high current yield with 
possible price appreciation) or to be invested in an associated money-
market mutual fund with preservation of capital being the objective, while
earning a money-market fund yield). The investors' portfolio values are 
protected on a very cost effective basis by effecting an exchange 
to a money market mutual fund and vice-versa.  More specific information 
is available in our<A HREF="faq.html"> "Frequently Asked Questions"</A> 
section. </P>

<P>The TimeTech Investor strategy is designed to <A HREF="value.html">
Add Value</A> to investors' portfolios in periods of market declines over
a buy and hold strategy.</P>

<P>The methodology has been successfully used in client portfolios since
1989 and has achieved outstanding performance results.  In our history, we
have achieved positive <A HREF="perform.html">Performance Results</A> in 
each quarter.</P>

<P>The Bond Market seems to be starting 1996 in much the same manner as 
it did in 1994, with rising interest rates.  Our <A HREF="position.html">
Current Market Position</A> may change but we will share with you our 
most recent decisions.  If you would like additional information or a copy
of SEC Form ADV part II, please contact us by e-mail or call us at 1-800-
965-0803.</P><BR>
