If you're the owner of one of the 24 million infected teeth that
were not extracted but dredged for a root canal last year, you
may wish you had read this book first. Or if you have undergone
several root canals, you may wish you'd never heard of it, or
learned that the true cover-up in root canal therapy is not the
substance lining your hollowed out tooth canals, but the fact
that the whole procedure may be frought with problems, infecting
your body, compromising your health, and probably not worth the
discomfort.
<P>
The trouble with root canals is that bacteria become trapped within
the literally 3 miles of microscopic dentin tubules inside a single-root
tooth. The bacterial toxins then circulate throughout the body,
wreaking biological havoc, including crippling degenerative diseases.
Antibiotics can't kill the bacteria once they're trapped inside
the tooth, so their only way out is down-into the body.  &quot;One
third of all disease in this country can be either directly or
indirectly traced to dental infections,&quot; Dr.  Meinig asserts.
<P>
Meinig bases his upsetting pronouncements on the basis of 25 years
of research by Dr. Weston Price, first published (and ignored)
in 1923, whom he regards as &quot;the world's greatest dentist.&quot;
Meinig supports his case with photographs, charts, patient studies,
the results of Dr. Price's studies with 5000 rabbits, and concise
summaries along the way.
<P>
Should you cancel your next root canal session or have all your
root-canalled teeth extracted? Not necessarily. It depends on
the vitality of your immune system and your genetic, constitutional
condition. Price's research showed that 25% of patients whose
family histories were free of degenerative diseases and who had
top-notch immune systems &quot;could expect to have and retain
root canal fillings and live without complications arising there
from through old age,&quot; writes Meinig.
<P>
But for the other 75%,  better think twice before the dentist
digs a canal in your tooth as this important, pioneering book
warns.

If the good country doctor , O.T. Bonnett, M.D., has a &quot;word
pill&quot; to offer us on the basis of 44 years of practice and
69 years of living it's this: 
<I>
change your outlook on life. 
</I>
Start thinking for yourself and accept responsibility for yourself,
your medical treatment, and your recovery. Dr. Bonnett fleshes
out his charming, personable memoir  (which is also equal parts
lecture and case book) with numerous examples from his long practice
as a family doctor in a small town. 
<P>
Your mind is a key player in any illness and any chance of recovery,
Bonnet argues-he uses hypnosis in his practice-and he shows how
it all works in heart disease, cancer, asthma, arthritis, and
other ills. In fact, Bonnet says that hypnosis should be &quot;high
on the list of useful investigational and therapeutic methods&quot;
and that every physician should be &quot;as skilled in the use
of hypnosis as he is with his stethoscope.&quot;
<P>
In Bonnet's view, &quot;our bodies are constantly being constructed
according to our thoughts and beliefs,&quot; so watch carefully
what you think and under no conditions, he adds, should you see
yourself as a victim.
<P>
Bonnet dishes out blunt criticism of both the conventional medical
profession and professional patients. He tells you what's wrong
with mainstream doctors and what's wrong with you, the conventional
patient. Yet Bonnet admits at the end of the day, that while he
talked and taught, begged and pleaded, told stories, made jokes,
yelled, pounded the desk, and swore at his patients in an attempt
to lead them to self-understanding, &quot;the most important thing
I did was to love them.&quot;
<P>
Not your typical M.D. (especially in the generation preceding
today's love-doctors like Bernie Siegel and Deepak Chopra), which
is why Bonnet is an instructive, uncompromising read.

Here's The Key, Inc., 1995, 249 pp., paper, $14.95. P.O. Box 223, Morgan VT 05853; tel: 802-895-4914.</FONT>

<P>
Dr. Lanct&ocirc;t, is clearly a philosopher in doctor's garb.
During the 20 years of her conventional medical practice, she
never once stopped asking vital questions of her profession, including
this one: Why are we so little informed about alternative medicine?
When she found the answer, it completely changed her focus as
a physician.
<P>
According to Lanct&ocirc;t, the problem is that we have a medicine
of sickness, not health. Conventional medicine is too expensive,
it looks at humans as machines, and leaves nearly everyone dissatisfied.
The solution is to develop a medicine of health. This treats the
causes, not the symptoms, of illness, and could reduce the cost
of medical care by 75%, Lanct&ocirc;t, argues. The reason this
is not happening yet is because of a major obstacle-the Medical
Mafia.
<P>
In Lanct&ocirc;t's view, this is the powerful conglomerate of
mainstream doctors, hospitals, insurance and drug companies, all
of whom have taken the power away from patients in the name of
their health &quot;security.&quot; In practice, &quot;the system
is at the service of the industry which pulls the strings and
maintains a system of sickness for its own profit.&quot;
<P>
The possible outcome of a profound overhaul of how we do medical
care in America could be the realization of self-health, says
Lanct&ocirc;t. To make this happen, we need a new partnership
and collaboration between the patient and doctor acting in the
sole interests of the patient on behalf of health. But for this
to happen, the silent, seemingly powerless mass of health care
users must rise up and reclaim their rights.
<P>
&quot;The only one who has the ultimate power to change the system
is the patient,&quot; and that is the key to self-health, Lanct&ocirc;t
says. Her book is bold, forthright, challenging  (and effectively
illustrated), carrying the moral authority of an M.D. who defected
from a system that doesn't work to one that does. If you have
mixed feelings about mainstream medicine, Lanct&ocirc;t will stir
things up for you; if you're on the edge of changing your mind,
Lanct&ocirc;t will push you over into a radically new attitude
about medicine in America.

<P>
This is one of a half dozen new handbooks by naturopath Murray
as part of Prima's 
<I>
Getting Well Naturally series. 
</I>
Other titles in this much-needed and well-executed series include discussions
of menopause, male sexual vitality, chronic fatigue syndrome,
stress, anxiety, and insomnia. In the present volume, Murray walks
you through the naturopathic approach to gaining control of your
blood sugar metabolism.
<P>
The hallmark of the naturopathic approach, expertly presented
here by Dr. Murray, is to work with the vital energies of the
whole body to bring balance to the system through trusting the
healing power of Nature. After carefully explaining the nature
of diabetes and hypoglycemia, Murray delves into dietary, nutritional,
and herbal recommendations for regulating blood sugar. He also
explains the links between smoking, alcohol, and exercise with
blood sugar regulation.
<P>
Murray rounds off his sound advice with a reflection on the role
of the physician as teacher or health educator. &quot;The physician's
role is to teach the patient about achieving health and avoiding
disease,&quot; Murray notes, making some well-earned plugs for
naturopathic medicine, now on the rise in America. &quot;In most
instances, the natural alternative offers significant benefit
over standard medical practices,&quot; he adds, perhaps understating
the situation.

&quot;The treatment for cancer throughout the modern and industrial
world has been a total disaster and a failure,&quot; writes Dr.
Wilner, who retired after 35 years of medical practice to research
a huge range of alternative cancer therapies not widely known
in the U.S., thanks largely to &quot;the suppressive efforts of
the FDA, the AMA, and the pharmaceutical industry.&quot; His ardent
goal in 
<I>
The Cancer Solution 
</I>
is to help convert the reader from &quot;victim to victor.&quot;
<P>
The &quot;solution&quot; to cancer lies in any of dozens of non-toxic,
safe, and relatively inexpensive natural therapies to which Dr.
Wilner devotes most of this excellent book. Here you can read
about herbal formulas from Chinese, Ayurvedic and Western herbal
traditions, the role of medicinal mushrooms, diet and nutrition
therapies, immune stimulants, electromagnetic field therapy, ozone,
and many other techniques still on the edge of the cancer solution.
<P>
Readers of Dr. Wilner's provocative guide to alternative cancer
therapies will be reassured that he puts his body where his ideas
are in the fact that he is a bladder cancer survivor. Although
he had the  tumor surgically removed 20 years ago, he credits
the fact that he's never had a recurrence to the radical changes
he since made in his diet, lifestyle, and attitude. In other words,
to following his own good advice presented here. Above all, Wilner
counsels, be heretical: don't believe in the myth of incurable
cancer.

Dr. Wilner, who died this spring, will be missed by the Digest
and his many readers.
