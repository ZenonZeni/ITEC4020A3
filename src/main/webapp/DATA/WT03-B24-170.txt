<B>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 5, 1995</B>--<BR>GenPharm International Inc. announced today at the 6th International Conference on Antibody Engineering in La Jolla, Calif., the generation of high affinity human IgG antibodies suitable for therapeutic use. These antibodies were produced from GenPharm's HuMAb-Mouse(TM), a transgenic mouse line containing human antibody genes that rearrange to form high affinity human antibodies. The mice can be used to generate monoclonal human antibodies to a wide variety of antigens, including human antigens.<P>

GenPharm's initial transgenic mouse was described in the British journal `Nature` (Nature 368:856). The work presented today covers the addition of other human sequences into the mouse along with extensive characterization of fully human IgG antibodies generated by it. These monoclonal antibodies had affinity levels suitable for therapeutic use with the highest affinity at greater than 10 to the 10th.<P>

Separately, GenPharm announced today that it had signed a renewal of its R&D Collaboration Agreement with Eisai Co. Ltd., a leading Japanese human health care company headquartered in Tokyo. The original agreement with Eisai, worth up to $25 million for research and milestone payments, was established in 1993.<P>

`We are delighted with Eisai's confidence in the value of GenPharm's novel technology and look forward soon to bringing important medical products to the clinic for the benefit of human patients,` commented Jonathan MacQuitty, Ph.D., chief executive officer of GenPharm International.<P>

GenPharm International Inc. is a world leader in the development of human monoclonal antibodies from transgenic mice for therapeutic and diagnostic uses.<P>

<I>Background</I><P>

GenPharm's transgenic HuMAb-Mouse contains key sequences from unrearranged human antibody genes as well as having inactivated mouse antibody genes. The human sequences code for both the human heavy and light chain segments of human antibodies. The human gene sequences function well in the mouse undergoing rearrangement to provide a wide repertoire of human antibodies similar to that in humans. Most importantly, the human antibodies in the transgenic mice undergo class switching and somatic mutation from low affinity IgM class antibodies to high affinity human IgG class antibodies.<P>

GenPharm has now generated human IgG antibodies using its transgenic mouse system with affinities that exceed 10 to the 10th. Antibodies for therapeutic use need affinities in this range to have clinical utility. In addition, because 
these antibodies are generated from human sequences, they should avoid the rejection problems that have often affected mouse-based antibodies.<P>

Another important feature of GenPharm's HuMAb-Mouse is its ability to react against human antigens. Thus, unlike most antibodies produced in humans, GenPharm's mice can generate human antibodies with high affinity against human antigens. This allows for the possibility of using human antibodies to control a wide range of inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and cancers. GenPharm has already generated human IgG antibodies to various human antigens, including IgE, CD4 and the cancer antigen CEA.<P>

Because the human sequences in the HuMAb-Mouse can generate high affinity human IgG directly in the mice, it is unnecessary to subject the human antibodies produced to any further manipulation, either to `humanize` the antibodies or to improve their affinity or specificity. Because the antibodies have been matured `in vivo,` they naturally have the specificity and affinity necessary for proper binding to the target antigen.<P>
