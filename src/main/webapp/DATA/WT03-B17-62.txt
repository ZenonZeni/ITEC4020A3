<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The White Shark (Carcharadon carcharias) is one of the oldest living species on Earth. This predator has, for millions of years, patrolled the oceans, remaining unchanged from it's creation. A perfectly adapted animal with some 20 million years of history behind it, the white shark is the undisputed ruler of our oceans. It has no natural enemies, apart from other white sharks. The only real enemy is man, who is in fact posing a great threat to the survival of the species.</B></FONT>

<B>M</B>an has, through the decades, with total lack of discrimination or remorse, brutally hunted and slaughtered this prehistoric animal. As a result, the white shark is now an endangered species and on top of the critical list for marine species. The white shark has been given many different names, created to describe it in a bad light. Names such as "Man Eater" and "White Death" are good examples of this. Razor sharp teeth and gashing jaws, gapping wounds and screaming humans are often associated with the white shark. This picture is both false and misleading.
<P><B>T</B>his unrivaled and perfect predator can, in many ways, seem frightening and dramatic but the hunting techniques used by the white shark must be put in the right perspective.  A white shark, that can reach a length of over twenty feet, could easily kill human being in a matter of seconds. Contrary to the common belief of the white shark being a mindless man eating machine, it is actually a highly selective predator and humans do not form part of its natural food chain. White shark attacks on humans are extremely rare. Over a sixty year period, only 124 white shark attacks were recorded around the world and, of these, only 26 were fatal.
<P>The white shark should be admired for its effectiveness, power and raw beauty. Unfortunately for the species, these are the factors that cleared the way towards its own extinction.

<P><B>T</B>here are many myths surrounding this animal, and the white shark's reputation worsened drastically during the 70's when the terrifying "JAWS" movies were launched. These movies were exclusively based on the white shark's insatiable hunger for human flesh. Subsequently, humans embarked on witch hunts and the unsuspecting white shark became public enemy number one. It was now looked upon as the ultimate hunting challenge. Countless numbers of beautiful white sharks were destroyed, only to be hung up on the jetty, to be gawked at by inquisitive onlookers. This, in combination with the horrifying shark fin trade, where approximately 200 million sharks of different species are caught every year, has drastically worsened the white shark's chances of survival.
<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="wshark1.jpg" WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="113"><B>T</B>he sharks are being heavily mutilated in the finning trade. Fins are cut off while the sharks are still alive and the carcasses are thrown back in, where the animals, unable to swim, face a lingering and inhumane death. The fins are mainly used for shark fin soup but are also used by several cultures that believe the fins enhance their sexual capacity. These facts are alarming. Not even a powerful animal like the white shark can stand up to such an indiscriminate and cruel hunt.
<P><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="wshark2.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="171"><B>A</B> white shark female reaches her sexual maturity at the approximate age of 15 years and length of 15 feet. The male reaches sexual maturity at the approximate age of 8 years and length of 12.5 feet.
<P>Fecundity is low and a female is thought to only reproduce a few times during her lifetime. Trophy hunters target the larger animals, resulting in a drastically reduced breeding stock. The white shark is one of the Earth's keystone species and is now an endangered animal. As it is one of the largest predators in the sea, its demise, together with that of other shark species, will have devastating consequences on the ecological balance in our marine environment.
<P><B>W</B>e have now reached a point where the existence and survival of these animals is uncertain. We cannot afford to lose them and therefore have to put our united efforts together to try to save our chief predators from disappearing. It is hoped that the high public profile of the white shark can be used as an example for the protection of other shark species.

<B>I</B>n April 1991, South Africa made environmental history by becoming the first country to declare the white shark a protected species. The white shark was placed on top of the critical list for endangered marine animals. This protection and conservation effort has now come to include the international arena, with similar laws being passed in California.
<P><B>B</B>y sponsoring expeditions with the South African White Shark Research Institute, Mad Dog Expeditions hopes to play its role in the preservation of the great white shark. South Africa, together <IMG WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=138 ALT="South African White Shark Institues LOGO" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="research.GIF">with the South African White Shark Research Institute (WSRI), are world leaders in white shark research. WSRI is a non profit, research, conservation and educational organization. It is privately funded and receives no governmental benefits. Institute heads Theo and Craig Ferreira have, together with the rest of the skilled research team, developed new research methods and attracting techniques. 
<BR><BR clear=all><IMG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=177 ALT="Photo of Great White Shark feedin on a seal" ALIGN=left SRC="Shark-seal.GIF"><B>T</B>heir findings are steadily revealing the mysteries surrounding the great white shark. In areas such as behavioral science, feeding ecology, abundance and movement, social and asocial behavior and environmental influences and effects, the WSRI have progressed in leaps and bounds.
<P><B>P</B>articipants in the expeditions will not only get to dive with the white sharks but they will take part in actual research and learn from the institute's staff. The expeditions also differ from most in that they are land based. The team leaves shore by fast boat every day to encounter the sharks and comes home to a luxurious eco-farm every night. While maintaining small group size and lower than average prices, the success rate of shark encounters on these trips has been one hundred percent to date. Divers and non-divers generally encounter larger numbers of the sharks here than anywhere else and have never been disappointed.
<P><IMG WIDTH=352 HEIGHT=126 ALT="Picture of boat" ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="boat.GIF"> <BR>
<P><B>T</B>he expeditions are flexible, with a typical duration of ten days. Group size never exceeds six people and can include divers and non-divers alike. The base price includes all expedition activities (including tanks and lead for divers), accommodations and food. All group members will be given a one day orientation as well as regular lectures and guidance from WSRI staff. They will be looked upon as WSRI team members for the duration of the trip, and are expected to participate in research duties such as tagging, tracking and recording of shark behavior. Divers should be certified to at least open water level and preferably to the advanced open water or equivalent level.
<P><IMG WIDTH=280 ALT="Photo of a man in a boat looking at a Great White Shark" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="shark-man.GIF"><B>O</B>ur base is situated approximately one hundred miles south of Cape Town, in a beautiful and wild part of South Africa. The accommodations are on a farm, in self contained chalets with all comforts and amenities. Though you won't have much time to spare during the expedition, the farm has many animals and vegetable patches as well as a swimming pool, horses to ride, tennis courts, mountain biking, soccer and cricket and nearby golf and canoeing. We encourage you to consider staying on past the actual expedition to visit this stunning country and would be glad to arrange additional tour or safari packages for you.
