CORPORATIONS ADVISED TO FOCUS ON MARKET RISK 

     Corporate finance professionals are finding they don't know
enough about measuring market risk to meet new  U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed regulations.  The SEC wants
executives to evaluate and disclose the market risks their companies
face and how they use derivatives as a hedge.  While the action is
intended to give investors a better understanding of the risks
involved with hedging, a new survey suggests many corporate finance
professionals don't fully understand the risks themselves.
     While there has been a dramatic effort in the last year or two to
establish or update corporate investment policies, "where we get into
a little bit of a problem is in the risk measurement and control
element of those policies," says Robert Baldoni, managing director  of
Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting.

Stumped by Value-at-Risk

     Emcor polled treasury executives recently at multinational
corporations and found that two-thirds of the more than 80 respondents
believed they did not have an adequate understanding of value-at-risk
(VAR).  
     Widely endorsed, VAR is considered an essential component of the
new SEC proposals.  The VAR approach looks at the entire corporate
risk profile, not just the individual transaction -- which is where
corporations tend to focus, says Baldoni.  "Many people are getting
involved in complex transactions and are not necessarily aware of the
ramifications," he says.  
     The SEC action comes exactly a year after the bankruptcy filing
of Orange County, Calif.  The municipality lost more than $1.5 billion
in ill-advised derivatives trades.  Similar recent disasters led the
SEC to review the annual reports of some 500 public companies to gauge
how well market risk was being evaluated and reported to investors.
     As a result of that investigation, the SEC is calling for new
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of hedging activity.  The
accounting policy for derivatives will have to be detailed within the
corporate financial statements. And the agency wants to see "a
narrative discussion" of the company's primary market risk exposures
and how those exposures are managed.  TREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT,
January 19, 1996                                                      
     To the extent that derivatives or other financial instruments are
used to hedge a company's primary market risk, the SEC proposes three
alternatives to disclose the associated risks:

     * The first option is to present a table with "common inputs to
market risk measurement methods," so that investors and analysts can
plug the data into their own models and do their own risk analysis;  

     * Alternatively, corporate financial executives may choose to
present a  "sensitivity analysis," illustrating the potential impact
of certain hypothetical market moves.  The SEC cautions that a
detailed explanation of the modeling techniques and parameters must be
included so that investors understand the analysis;

     * The third option is a VAR model which calculates the net effect
of all of the hedges used entity-wide.  The risk projection is
expressed as the most that could be lost over a specific period -- a
day, a week, a month -- with a statistically-derived confidence level. 
In other words, a typical VAR expression would be that over the next
quarter there is a 90 percent confidence level that the loss potential
due to market activity will be no more than x dollars.  To have that
kind of overarching measure of market risk requires some sophisticated
number crunching.

Why VAR, Why Now?

     Little about the VAR concept is new, except the need to apply it
in a corporate environment.  Financial institutions with dynamic
trading operations long have used the approach.  And while most
corporations have fairly simple and stable hedging positions, Baldoni
says that's changing:  "As we have gotten into more complex
instruments the risk profile has changed.  And unfortunately, the
instruments that are being offered are way ahead of the control
systems in most of these institutions." 
     The basic statistical concepts of standard deviation, variance
and covariance are at the heart of the so-called "analytic approach,"
to VAR, but various simulation methods can also produce VAR
measurements.  However, even the most vigilant risk manager may be
stumped by where to get the numbers.  
     Until New York-based J.P. Morgan introduced its RiskMetrics
database in the fall of 1994, there wasn't a reliable, consistent
source of data, says Mike Salzberg, partner with Price Waterhouse in
New York.  
     "One of our goals is to demystify derivatives," explains Jacques
Longerstaey, head of the Market Risk Research unit at Morgan.  The
firm provides free access to data on commodity futures, fixed-income,
equity and currency markets, as well as volatility measures and
correlations.  The RiskMetrics data is available via the Internet
(http://www.jpmorgan.com), and such information services as Bloomberg,
Reuters and Dow Jones Telerate.  
     Access to data has not been the only barrier to widespread use of
VAR.  In fact, 84 percent of the respondents in the Emcor survey
indicated they have not used the RiskMetrics database.  
     A majority indicated they simply don't have the software to make
use of the data, which is probably not surprising considering a base
level VAR package runs from $100,000 to $200,000 a year, according to
Baldoni.  He adds that cheaper packages on the market are not very
good.  
     "To pay for the software and get your people trained you've got
to have the deal flow to justify it," he says.  Most corporations
don't, and will choose to outsource the analysis. 

Who Is Responsible for VAR?

     Under the new SEC proposals, a corporation will be held
accountable for the risk quantification that is put before the public. 
"I think it's beginning to open up a very interesting issue," says
Salzberg of Price Waterhouse.  "Once it starts getting into the area
of actually disclosing numbers, who's responsible for that number?  Is
it the risk manager?  The capital markets guy?  The CFO who signs his
name on the report?"  
     Baldoni says his goal with the VAR concept is to make the numbers
understandable to the highest levels of the corporation, "so, 10 or 12
months later when something goes wrong people aren't saying, 'Oh, I
didn't know.'"
     The SEC's stated goal is to make risk quantification
understandable to investors, and that, Salzberg says, will have
repercussions in the market.       "Suppose I divide VAR into revenue?
What I wind up with is a risk-adjusted value," allowing investors to
gauge how much they're putting at risk to make that return, he
explained.  
     "That's how we choose between investments," adds Salzberg, and 
"right now we can't do that."  But he cautions that VARs should be
considered directional measures, and not absolute numbers.
     "Establishing an historic pattern of risk-adjusted numbers will
allow investors to look back and see how accurate the company has been
in determining its risk profile," he says.  (Robert Baldoni, Emcor
Risk Management Consulting, 914/591-4790; Jacques Longerstaey, J. P.
Morgan, 212/648-8321; Michael Salzberg, Price Waterhouse, 212/596-
8945; Michael H. Sutton, SEC, 202-942-4400.)

CORPORATE-VALUE-AT-RISK

        The value-at-risk (VAR) approach was developed by and for the
trading operations of financial institutions, but has been endorsed
for corporate use by the Group of Thirty, the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, the Financial Executives Institute and now
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting
developed a proprietary risk measurement system which they call
Corporate-Value-At-Risk (CVAR).  The concept embodies four distinct
measures, each of which can employ the full range of statistical
analysis -- variance, covariance, historic scenario analysis, Monte
Carlo analysis, etc.:

* Operating Exposure

This measures the underlying risk exposure that results from the
company's operating activities to determine if there is enough risk to
warrant the time spent managing it.

* Financial Instrument Exposure

This step applies the same analysis specifically to the financial
instruments chosen to manage the company's underlying risk.  These
tools include such things as securities, debt and hedge instruments.

* Operating Exposure and Hedges

Step three is to overlay measures one and two and run the same risk
analysis a third time.  This measure, when compared with the company's
initial operating exposure, should indicate a lower overall level of
risk.

* Counterparty Exposure

This analysis focuses on the company's risk exposure to each financial
institution that serves as a counterparty.  It provides a measure of
the upside potential of the hedging portfolio, so that the company
stays below its counterparty credit limit.

SENATE BILL TIGHTENS UP ON PENSION PLAN AUDITS

The Pension Audit Improvement Act (S. 1490), introduced in the U.S.
Senate last month, would eliminate limited scope audits, enhance the
qualifications necessary for pension plan auditors and require those
auditors to promptly notify authorities of any serious violations. 
All of which, it is expected, will significantly raise the cost of
plan administration.  
        The measure was introduced in the midst of the holiday
season, betwixt government shutdowns and before the east coast
disappeared under a blizzard.  
Because of the timing, reaction against the bill has been muted, "but
my guess is you're going to see mobilization," says Paul Doxsee, vice
president of St. Paul, Minn.-based Pension Solutions Inc., the
marketing arm of MSI Insurance Group which specializes in 401(k) plan
administration for firms with fewer than 500 employees. 

When Is An Audit Not An Audit?

        Plan administrators, under current law, can exclude certain
pension plan assets from the annual audit as long as those assets are
invested with a regulated institution such as a bank or insurance
company.  The assumption has been that those assets are being audited
elsewhere.  About half of the required audits under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) contain a "limited scope
disclaimer." 
        "Potentially, the majority of the assets in a plan aren't
audited, and then you're not getting the full benefit of an audit,"
says Sue Hicks with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) in Washington, D.C.      
        Since 1987 the U. S. General Accounting Office and the U.S.
Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General have issued separate
reports questioning the suitability of limited scope audits.  
        To further dramatize the situation, U.S. Secretary of Labor
Robert B. Reich announced in November that Department of Labor (DOL)
investigators had more than 300 civil- and criminal inquiries underway
against companies accused of improperly diverting 401(k) funds. 
Doxsee acknowledges DOL has found some bad apples, but says, "I think
they've already heightened the awareness ... why do they need the
audit requirement on top of it?"
     Although the independent Washington, D.C.-based, Employee Benefit
Research Institute (EBRI) has not taken an official position on the
bill, organization president Dallas Salisbury says the bill's reforms
come at a relatively high price "with the principal beneficiaries
being the nation's accounting firms." 
   Whatever the cost, it's outweighed by the benefits, says the
AICPA's Hicks.  The benefits, however, may be in the eye of the
beholder.  While DOL  traditionally has found most 401(k) problems in
small firms, plans with fewer than 100 employees are exempt from
audits altogether.  "This would be a further cost and discouragement
for large plans while not doing anything to get at the problems
related to small plans," says Salisbury.      
   According to Hicks, AICPA committees have estimated the
legislation would push up the cost of a pension plan audit by 10
percent-to-40 percent.  "I would say that for some of our clients who
are marginally profitable, that increase may force a decision to
discontinue the plan.  That's very real.  To a small employer, $500 to
$1000 matters a great deal," says Doxee.  (Paul Doxee, Pension
Solutions, 612/631-7760; Sue Hicks, AICPA, 202/737-6600; Dallas
Salisbury, Employee Benefit Research Institute, 202/659-0670.)

RESOURCEIQ OPENS WINDOW TO EUROPE

   Privately-held ADS Associates Inc. is considering conquering the
world, again.  The Calabasas, Calif.-based software developer has
established sales and service outposts throughout the world to support
Global Trader, a leading broker-dealer work station used by central
banks and global financial institutions.  But the company's treasury
management workstation, Resource, has barely ventured outside North
America.  That may change this year.
   "Our new Windows product was designed with an eye toward
international applications," says Harvey Holman, vice president for
sales.  "The DOS-based Resource product was very much North America-
oriented," he adds.
   The Windows release, ResourceIQ, is due out in June and is
expected to introduce several unique features.  Among them, a "drag
and drop" capability that allows figures and graphs to be moved to
outside applications without the intermediary step of going to an
ASCII flat file.
   Similarly, a spreadsheet figure showing an account surplus can be
moved and dropped on a wire transfer icon and automatically moved into
an overnight investment.  "Through an application programming
interface, all the appropriate wire transfer information moves along
with the figure," says Holman.
   In addition to the new gee-whiz functionality, ResourceIQ has
gained derivatives, sensitivity analysis and risk analysis
functionality from Global Trader -- "all the things that corporates
want, but have traditionally not been able to afford," says Holman.  
Whereas a Global Trader workstation runs between $1 million and $3
million, the average Resource installation costs $30,000-to-$80,000.
   Annette Sneckenberg, financial operations manager for a $3 billion
Omaha-based conglomerate, settled on the ADS Resource workstation a
year ago after grilling three vendors.  "Overall, they had the better
package, and the people who came to do the demo were so knowledgeable
we couldn't stump them on anything," Sneckenberg says.  Her firm,
privately-held Peter Kiewit Sons, has more than 250 subsidiaries.  "We
were looking for an investment system that could run the gamut," she
says.  (Harvey Holman, ADS, 818/591-2371; Annette Sneckenberg, Peter
Kiewit Sons, 402/536-3623.)

Commentary

     The corporate bond market seems to be on hiatus, apparently
taking its cue from the federal government shutdown in Washington,
D.C.  With neither economic indicators nor a federal budget to guide
forecasts, corporate credit issuers are on the sidelines.
     Beyond Wall Street, the federal government shutdown has blacked
out more than data.  Billions of dollars in civilian and military
export licenses are held up at the Commerce Department; Small Business
Administration loans have dried up; and government contractors have
been idled.  
     At the same time, the East Coast blizzard silenced major
retailing centers from Boston to Richmond.  Wall Street's manic
reaction to the federal budget talks sank the stock and bond markets
last week when political differences appeared to put off any hope of a
balanced budget pact.
     The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down over 2.5 percent for the
year to date.  Similarly, the bond market has given back its late
December gains, pushing the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond over the 6
percent mark.  The Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meets
again Jan. 30, but most market analysts expect the Fed is as much in
the dark as they are and so will put off any interest rate action.  
     What little information the market has comes from the Fed this
week with its report on December industrial production and capacity
utilization.  The U.S. Labor and Commerce Departments are expected to
be catching up this week on overdue reports covering gross national
product, employment, retail sales and producer and consumer prices.

FIRMS WORRY ABOUT BUDGET FIGHT

   A poll conducted last month by the Morristown, N.J.-based
Financial Executives Institute (FEI), found that senior financial
executives in the United States are concerned about the failure of
President Clinton and the U.S. Congress to reach a balanced- budget
agreement.  Asked how a budget impasse would directly affect their
companies, 68 percent predicted higher interest rates; 56 percent
expected reduced sales; 40 percent believed it would negatively affect
employment; and 50 percent said it would decrease their companies'
stock prices.  An earlier FEI membership poll, conducted in early
November, found most of the respondents in favor of Congress' tough
tactics -- two-thirds of the respondents said they favored tying an
extension of the federal debt ceiling to passage of the budget
reconciliation package.  (Jim Kaitz, FEI, 202/659-3700.)

SEC COULD WANT DISCOUNT BACK

The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's recent budgetary lapse
resulted in a firesale on securities registrations (TMR, Nov. 24).  In
the absence of a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
appropriation amending the filing rate set in the Securities Act of
1933, filers were paying 1/50th of one percent of the value of their
filing.  With the emergency funding measure passed on Jan. 6, that
rate goes back to 1/29th of one percent.  But the SEC says filers who
got away with the lower rate between Dec. 15 and Jan. 8 may be
required to make up the difference. (SEC Office of Filer Support, 
202/942-8900.)

BANKS PUSH CHECKS ON CD-ROM

Several major banks have come to market in recent weeks offering check
images on CD-ROM.  The new technology uses search and retrieval
software to pull up a check image on a personal computer screen as
opposed to pulling a paper check out of a storage box, or waiting for
the check to clear.  New York-based Chase Manhattan Bank announced a
CD-ROM enhancement for its ImageAccess check disbursement customers. 
These are customers who issue thousands of checks a month.  Each CD
can store up to 25,000 checks.  Similarly, Chemical Banking Corp.'s
New York-based Geoserve division now offers check images on CD to
controlled disbursement customers of Chemical Bank Delaware.  And Bank
of Boston is offering corporate customers check image delivery on CD
as an alternative to receiving traditional paper or microfilm.  "Many
customers anticipate that they will be able to resolve telephone
inquiries while the payee or customer is still on the phone," says
Mary Ann Hardy, Bank of Boston image product development manager.

(ISDA) introduced a new series of derivatives messages.  The new
message types are MT 360, single currency interest rate swap
confirmation; MT 361, cross currency interest rate swap confirmation;
and MT 362, interest rate swap reset confirmation.  The new messages
are intended to improve the ability of swap dealers to execute
confirmations and to reduce the operational risk in interest rate swap
transactions.  "Control of operational risk is of primary importance
for the financial services industry," said Peter Guldentops, S.W.I.F.T
senior manager for standards.  (Ian Fraser, S.W.I.F.T., 011/32-2-655-
4430; Carolyn Jackson, ISDA, 212/332-1200.)

STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING WORRIES HIGH TECH FIRMS 

   Corporate financial officers may have won a round with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), but now many are finding
they still have a lot to lose.  After facing years of opposition, the
FASB agreed in October to back down from its plan to require that
corporate financial statements reflect the value of stock options
granted as compensation.
   The FASB wanted corporations to fix a cost to those options and
charge it against earnings.  While that won't happen, effective
January 1 the FASB is requiring that the same valuation be included in
corporate financial footnotes.  "This is one footnote I hope the
readers of our financial statements don't read," says Chris Paisley,
chief financial officer for 3Com Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based
high technology firm.
   It's not that Paisley has anything to hide, other than a profound
befuddlement over how to value the thousands of options his company
grants each year.  All 4,600 of 3Com's employees receive options as
part of the company's bonus and incentive program.  "We were obviously
none too thrilled with this pronouncement," says Paisley.  Start-up
high tech firms like 3Com routinely use stock options in lieu of
scarce cash to attract top talent.   

FASB Provides Questionable Model  

   The FASB's Statement 123 explains that for stock options "fair
value is determined using an option-pricing model that takes into
account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the
expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock
and the expected dividends on it, and the risk-free interest rate over
the expected life of the option."
    "When CFOs realize the complexity of what they're going to have
to do, they're going to be in shell shock because it's not going to be
an easy compliance by any stretch," says Cheryl Breetwor, president of
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based ShareData, which provides software for stock
option accounting to some 2000 customers throughout the United States. 
To date, ShareData has produced software that merely tracks a
company's stock options, keeping up with who's vested, and how many
options have been exercised.  Putting a value on those options is
something else.
   "It's not nearly as simple as the FASB has made it sound.  It's
going to be very costly," she says.  Not only will the software will
be expensive, but so will the consulting help Breetwor assumes
companies will need in making projections about stock price,
dividends, length of employee service and interest rates, all of which
are needed to feed the FASB model.   (Cheryl Breetwor, ShareData,
408/746-3666; Chris Paisley, 3Com, 408/764-5000.)
