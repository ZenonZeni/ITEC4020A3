<h1><font size="3">1994 American Management Survey on workplace
drug testing.</font></h1>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">The following is taken from the 1994 American
Management Survey on workplace drug testing. (Unpublished)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The survey responses are for January 1994 and
represent the American Management Association (AMA's) corporate
membership of 7000 U.S. organizations, which employ in total a
quarter of the American workforce.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to the survey. . . . </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The percentage of companies that drug test
employees rose from 84.8 % (January 1993) to 87.2% (January 1994)
This represents an increase of over 300% since 1987.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Business category is the most important factor
in the occurrence of testing programs. The two categories most
likely to test are manufacturing firms (93%) and transportation
companies (92%). Size also plays a role -- 91% of organizations
with more than 1000 employees test, though smaller ones aren't
far behind (81%). Geographically, there are fairly substantial
variations too: companies in the desert and mountain states of
the West are the most likely to test (91%), while companies in
New England are the least likely (68%).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">53% of companies that test do so under
government mandate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The test-positive rate, which had fallen
steadily since 1989, levelled in 1993, at 2.5%. The AMA
attributes this not to lesser use, but to the fact that
test-positives rates fell consistently only as the testing pool
increased -- the levelling in 1993 and 1994 reflects the
levelling in the growth of testing programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is a direct correlation between the
increase in testing and the decrease in test-positive rates.
According to the AMA, this is not because testing acts as a
deterrent to drug use, but rather because as more employees are
being tested for reasons other than suspicion of use, the
test-positive rate would naturally fall.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among companies that perform random testing,
the 1993 test-positive rate was 2.1%. Among those companies that
test only for cause, the rate was 11.1%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Companies that offer drug education programs as
well as testing have lower test-positive rates than those that
provide only testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 5% of companies neither test employees nor
offer drug education programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Action on test-positive employees: 31% of
companies dismiss test-positives, and more than half of these
offer no other alternative. The rest regard firing as a last
resort, after counselling and disciplinary actions have been
trlied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">68% of companies test new hires. Tests are
rarely given as part of the application process per se; instead
testing occurs when the applicant has already been offered the
job. The offer is then conditional on the applicant passing the
test. 1% of companies that test new hires will hire
test-positives on a probationary basis; 95% specifically state
that test-positives will not be hired, the rest take other
actions, such as retesting at a later date. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">METHODS -- 82.1% use urine testing. 12.9% use
blood testing. 1.1% use hair testing. 0.9% use performance
testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Of those who use urine testing, only 70% retest
an initial positive with a more rigorous, confirmatory test. 13%
repeat the same procedure on the same sample. 5% take and test a
new sample. 7% perform no validation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 79% of those that urine test use
NIDA-certified labs. Only 48% use a medical review officer (MRO)
to analyze test findings, judge them against the testee's medical
history, and render a verdict.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 6% of firms that test pay lower insurance
premiums because of their programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It may seem reasonable to assume that
drug testing has a deterrent effect on drug use. . . . However,
no finding of this eight-year AMA survey effort can confirm as a
statistical certainty that testing does in fact deter use. . . .
Testing cannot and should not be expected to take the place of
good supervision. The American Management Association has
consistently advised that. . . . Actions regarding employee
discipline be performance-based.&quot; </font></p>
