Reusing Paint Waste
</H1>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Paint makes cars,</B> appliances and other products attractive, but paint also generates waste. This waste must be collected, stored, transported, analyzed and legally disposed of. There is an alternative, however, recycling. 

<P>Environmental Purification Industries recycles more than 10,000 tons of waste annually. The recycling processes it uses are approved by the EPA for paint waste recycling. The processes are the DryPure&#153; System and the Polymeric 
Recovery System, a new technology. 

<P>Before waste is accepted, generators must provide an eight-oz sample and a paint waste profile. Technicians test the sample, review the profile and conduct a metals analysis to determine if the material can be processed. Once approved, shipments are off loaded into a hopper for transfer to one of the two recycling systems. 

<P>The new technology, Polymeric Recovery System (PRS) handles waste once considered non-recyclable, such as epoxy resins, latex paints and inks. These can be processed and reused by the same industries that produced them. 

<P>For example, the paint on a car contains components similar to those in underbody sealants. Using a low-heat process, the PRS recaptures these resins. 

<P>First, a quality analysis is performed to determine what additives need to be introduced into the sludge to control its final physical properties. The mixture is pumped into a reactor and processed for several hours under vacuum and low 
heat, less than 300F. All vapors and liquids are removed and condensed. 

<P>The dehydrated, gray, putty-like material left behind is pumped from the reactor and tested for quality assurance. This uncured resin is finally formed into 30 lb units for packaging. 

<P>The final product, EPI-MERTM is sold back to the industry that created it for use in caulks, adhesives, rubber compounds and the sealants that undercoat cars. 

<P>The company provides a Recycling Certificate that guarantees that the waste delivered was recycled into a safe, useful product.
