<H1>SPH211   Quantum Physics </H1> 
<PRE>
Credit Points:          10<P>
Duration:               First Semester.
Methodology             2L, 1T and 3P per week.  
Prerequisites:          SPH101 or SPH161, SPH102, SMA102 
Assessment:<P>     
30% Practical, 55% Final Exam, 15% Continuous Assessment.  
Separate passes in the Theoretical and practical components are required.
Objectives:             
The aim of this unit is to develop a conceptual understanding of the 
quantum theory and show how the principles of Quantum Mechanics govern 
the behaviour of a number of modern technological devices. 
Description:        
This unit introduces the concepts of quantum physics with applications to 
examples from atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics.  Topics 
covered include energy quantisation, the time dependent and time 
independent Schrodinger equation, wave packets, the one dimensional 
potential well problem, the phenomenon of tunnelling.  The nature of 
electron spin, Spin-Statistics theorem and Pauli exclusion principle, 
atomic structure and molecular bonding.  Bonding in amorphous and 
crystalline solids, Maxwell-Boltzmann and Fermi statistics, energy bands 
and energy gaps, thermal, electrical, magnetic and optical properties of 
solids, Semi-conductor devices, Population inversions and lasers, 
Superconductivity.  The practicals require the student to repeat some of 
the classic experiments of modern physics such as; the photoelectric 
effect, the Franck-Hertz experiment, Millikan's oil drop experiment, 
electron spin resonance, and the <I>e/m</I> ratio for the electron.
