TOUGH 1997 AHEAD, SAYS CHUA ROBERT CHUA SHARES HIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON
ASIA WITH NEAL WEINSTOCK

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

"It's very tough going now in Asia," says Robert Chua. Chua is the
founder and CEO of the Hong Kong-based, Chinese language, family
entertainment channel, CETV.

Though CETV's programming philosophy is, "no sex, no violence, no
politics", Chua is one of the more refreshingly candid TV industry
leaders in the region.

A Singaporean who felt he had to move to Hong Kong to work in the
industry, who then had a large part in building TVB's programming
dominance, and who now runs what a recent independent survey calls
the top-rated overseas satellite channel in China, Chua also has a
uniquely broad perspective on Asian TV.

On Western-based programme services in China: "I know that
(Disney's) ABC has had a lot of problems." The company's two
locally produced programmes, Panda Club and Dragon Club, "are going
downhill. Some stations are dropping them. That's going to be
happening to all the Western companies in China.

"The profits aren't what they thought it could be when they went
in."

On running an international satellite service: "I want to just
concentrate on mainland China now. To tell the truth, people are
not going to spend one single cent to advertise on us just to reach
an audience in Indonesia.

"Taiwan is weak for us, too they want to see more sex and violence,
when we have to focus on being a family channel. Even a family
channel means very different things from country to country, so I
don't think an international channel makes so much sense now."

CETV is a fascinating example in how ownership and programming
inter-relate, and how they often do not.

Chua sold a large minority stake in CETV last year to International
Family Entertainment (IFE), the parent of America's and Europe's
Family Channels and a large producer of programming. IFE is owned
by US Christian television preacher and conservative activist Pat
Robertson, who may seem a strange bedfellow for a mainland Chinese
channel.

Yet the only cultural conflict in the relationship so far, says
Chua, has been the one that would be most obvious to viewers - and
least obvious, perhaps, to international TV executives: "A family
channel in the West has very different values than in Asia.

To date we have not taken any of IFE's programmes. There are two
reasons for that. Number one, the family values are different.
Number two, what we are prepared to pay. We can only afford low
fees for shows."

Nonetheless, CETV carries many imported programmes: National
Geographic, films from Hallmark and ACI, Venezuelan telenovelas
from Coral Pictures, many cartoons, and an "edited version" of
NHK's business report.

"Content-wise, we are very much curtailed," he continues. "We have
to be very, very creative. We have to spend lots of time on
programming. Otherwise we'd become an educational channel. That's a
very close thing to a family channel in China, very different than
the West."

One new example of CETV programming is the two-part documentary,
"Hong Kong: Countdown to July 1, 1997." With a plan to focus on
visual changes and residents' feelings, Chua is resolute in
maintaining that this series on a most political event will be
"soft news, non-political." That's a hard balancing act to pull
off.

More on the Hong Kong changeover: "After '97, we'll consider a move
to mainland China. I want to establish and run a professional
outfit here (in Hong Kong) first, that can manage a move of part of
the operation to someplace like Guangzhou later on. We're running
160 staff now, you know. That's a very lean operation."

On international channels in general, and English-language channels
especially: "There are so many channels going now to Asia. We are
all having very tough going right now. There are too many English
channels now, really.

"Do you know where the market is for all these English-language
channels? I don't know where there are so many people who speak
English. Doing Chinese channels is not easy, though. There's not
enough talent. There's no way for new channels to get onto cable;
getting penetration is very difficult."

On advertising: Chua has a very happy story to tell these days,
with the China-based X&L Marketing Service having recently released
a 14-city study showing CETV to be the highest-rated overseas
satellite channel in Chinese cable homes.

Still, "The ad market is tough because of ratings in China; there
are no good ratings services yet. We are now putting our act
together. We've just changed our advertising and sales department;
it's 90 per cent changed from a year ago."

On why TVB's growth has slowed in recent years: "Maybe losing S.K
Fung (to NBC) was a big reason."

On Singapore's TV business environment: "Singapore's opening up.
There are a lot of benefits now for the industry, tax benefits, for
example. But there are not enough people in production. Hong Kong
has more than 10,000 local talent in the TV industry; 3,000 at TVB
alone, 3,000 in the studios. Well over 10,000. Singapore is still
importing people. It should have developed local talent a long time
ago. Now, there's no reason why it can't get there, but it takes
time.

"Also, Singapore in the past had too much government control. Even
now that TCS is supposed to be privatised, there can't really be
enough competition without separating control of channel 5 and
channel 8.

"There's truly not enough competition. I did ask three years ago
for a terrestrial licence there, and we've not yet gotten it. I'd
give them a run for their money."

On Asian stations and TV technology: "I don't think our level in
Asia is up to the West's. We're a new station and we need to keep
spending down, find ways to produce things cheaply. Not everyone
has that need, though. Look at CPN; they spent US$30 million on
just technology for everything digital.

"It's wonderful to have that, if you have the money. If not, well,
we don't do news, so we can get by cheaper. We don't need digital;
simple programmes don't require it. Instead, we spend on talent,
which is quite limited."  '

MINERVA INTROS DVD ENCODING SOLUTION

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Minerva Systems has introduced the Compressionist 250 for the
creation of digital video disc (DVD) video assets.

The DVD format expands the capacity of 5-inch discs to 4.7 Gb - or
133 minutes of high-quality MPEG-2 compressed digital video and AC-
3 or MPEG-2 surround sound audio with multiple language sub-titles
on a single-sided version of the back-to-back bonded disc.

The 250, based on C-Cube Microsystems' VLSI processors, offers both
Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) MPEG-2 encoding
technology combined with Minerva's video pre-processing and control
software tools.

Minerva's DVD encoding system also supports leading third-party AC-
3 and MPEG-2 audio encoders, and DVD authoring and disc formatting
tools.

When encoding film-originated content for NTSC delivery, the unit's
inverse telecine feature accurately restores the incoming video's
24 frames per second during the encoding process.

The 250's application control software, Minerva Studio, provides an
easy-to-use interface for both single-pass and multi-pass MPEG-2
VBR encoding.

In multi-pass mode, the Compressionist 250 first profiles the video
sequence by gathering statistics and determines the optimum
allocation of the available bits to the compressed sequence.

In the second pass, the Minerva encoder performs real-time encoding
while controlling the bit rate according to the bit allocation
strategy determined in the first pass.

Optionally, Minerva Studio control software enables users to
optimize and reencode the video source based on their artistic
judgment.

The 250 supports D1, YUV, S-Video and composite video input and
video resolutions up to the CCIR 601 digital standard for NTSC (720
x 240 at 60 fields per second) and PAL (720 x 288 at 50 fields per
second) and variable compressed data rates ranging from 2 to
10Mbps.

The unit is currently shipping with a base system price of
US$99,000.

QUESTECH 1012 DECODER NOW WITH SYNCHRONISER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

QUESTECH's 1012 composite to serial digital encoder is now
available with a plug-in synchroniser option which provides a
separately timed output from the decoder, effectively making it two
products in one.

As a decoder, the unit provides a quality interface between
composite and serial digital component video equipment. It accepts
both analogue and optionally, digital (D2 or D3 format) inputs and
outputs signals.

The 1012 is the first decoder from the manufacturer which handles
all variants of PAL and NTSC signals and complements the company's
existing range of interface products. The unit digitises incoming
analogue signals with 10 bit resolution.  All signals processing
and conversions are then performed digitally.

A full bandwidth adaptive comb filter decoder separates the
luminance and chrominance signals in the digital domain and the
signals are transparently rate converted, interleaved and
serialised to form the output signal. EDH coding is incorporated to
assist in system evaluation and quality control.

The synchroniser is controlled from menu-driven front panel
controls and can either be used to retime the unit decoder output,
or a separate auxiliary output.  It is compatible with 50Hz and
60Hz systems and allows freezing on either field.

Output timing can be adjusted throughout an entire video frame.

DPA4060 MINIATURE MIC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

POSSIBLY the smallest product launch of 1996, the new
omnidirectional DPA4060 from Danish Pro Audio has been designed for
use with wireless systems in theatres or on television, wherever
microphones need to be mounted on a performer.

It will fit most VHF and UHF systems for professional use, and is
rather robust.

The unit uses a new 5.4mm pre-polarised condenser cartridge with a
vertical diaphragm. It can handle SPLs to a maximum of 134dB, and
has an on-axis frequency response of 20Hz to 20kHz +/-2dB.

It has a dynamic range of 97dBA (THD = 1%) and there is 13dB of
headroom before clipping occurs.

Connection options include factory mounted connectors for the most
popular systems, or the 'pig tail' (without connectors).

HP TEST SOLUTION FOR DIGITAL SET-TOP BOXES, DEVICES

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Hewlett-Packard recently introduced at IBC 96, the industry's first
test source designed to help equipment manufacturers and cable TV
operators bring new digital-video products and services to market
quickly and efficiently.

The test source, the HP E4441A DVB QAM coder, is designed to help
set-top box and device makers develop and produce high-quality
Digital Video Broadcasting-Cable (DVB-C)-compliant equipment.

The new coder operates in conjunction with HP's latest family of
ESG signal generators to provide a reference radio-frequency (RF)
signal. This signal can be modified and impaired in a controlled
manner to test the limits of receiver design and improve
manufacturing process control. The HP E4441A also is designed to
help cable TV operators optimize network performance and manage
interoperability issues.

The manufacturers believe that the HP E4441A DVB QAM coder will
become an important part of any Bit-Error-Rate (BER) test system
because it can be configured to perform a variety of tests to give
users maximum test coverage. Users can easily change symbol rate,
constellation size and channel coding at the touch of a button.

The unit generates extremely accurate QAM (Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation) signals, which can be impaired in a calibrated manner.

The amount of noise, added to the signal internally, can be
controlled to characterize receivers and networks. Users also may
test DVB-C network equipment in ideal or non-ideal signal
conditions to get "real-world" test data.

The new coder is the result of HP's continued work within the DVB
Project, an industry consortium organized to set standards for
delivering compressed digital video.

The DVB Measurements Group, which develops measurement techniques
and definitions, is an important link for enabling the rapid
deployment of new digital-video services using DVB-C technology.

NEWSWORKS TURBO NOW WITH BETACAM SP QUALITY

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Delivering Beta-SP equivalent picture quality to newsroom users,
the new Newsworks Turbo editing system was launched recently by
Tektronix at IBC '96.

Fully integrated with the classic 'intuitive' user-interface
featured in all Lightworks editing systems, its major applications
include 'direct to air' operations. Immediately available, it is
targeted both as low-cost, low maintenance stand-alone replacement
for existing tape-based linear suites and as a key component of
large-scale automated and networked newsroom systems.

The new introduction is offered as a chargeable option for existing
Newsworks editing system customers. The system effective doubles
the first version's Hi-Res performance to the near Beta-SP level of
5 minutes per Gigabyte  - 10 minutes previously - or equivalent to
4:1 compression running at around 24 Mbit/s.

This is achievedby stripping alternative fields of video
information - and similarly audio channels - over a pair of
material hard drives. For the user, across a single pair, this
provides for a continuous recording of up to 20 minutes - or up to
40 minutes at the 10 minutes per Gigabyte standard.

Fully 'backwards' compatible with earlier 10-minutes per Gigabyte
non-striped material, Turbo will also support mixed compression
rates within the same project or edit.

It employs industry-standard storage options - 9Gb drives in a
variety of configurations up to 90 Gb in a standard unit and
expandable externally via SCSI driver cards to 180 Gb.

Central to the system's ability to deliver the full value of non-
linear editing to the newsroom and achieve significant gains in
operational speed, is the 'Edit-to-It' feature.

This allows direct editing of late arriving tapes with select, trim
and preview on tape under console control. Once selected, material
- with handles - is digitised via a simple commit command and is
available for immediate or future changes.

'Edit-to-It' will also now control a channel of Tek's Profile
Professional Disk Recorder (PDR). This allows Profile PDR-stored
material to be accessed directly and employed in an edit
immediately.

Other key benefits include further operational acceleration with
direct 'voice-over record'.

This allows recording of a single audio channel while playing other
picture and sound channels at an edit station simultaneously (or
recording a picture while sound is playing); direct 'Play-to-Air'
either under manual, newsroom computer or external control from an
automation system via RS422 emulating a BVW75 VTR. New as well is
'StripView', a visual timeline representing both pictures and sound
in the cut and allowing individual shot identification and dynamic
trims and changes.

In addition, the Turbo is supplied as standard with eight real
internal digital audio channels - expandable externally via one or
two Pro Sound boxes.

The Newsworks Turbo systems are immediately available world-wide.

NEW THOMSON PRODUCTS AT IBC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

TWO of several new products that Thomson Broadcast Systems
introduced at IBC were the Microcam split head compact camera and
4005 dockable Betacam SX recorder.

The Microcam, for ENG or EFP applications, is based on the 1657
camera, with the CCD block used remotely to provide a small and
very manoeuverable camera. The CCD block can be re-mounted on the
camera body for conventional use.

The Microcam is useful in many shooting situations, in particular
when the cameraman is in an awkward position, such as on a
motorcycle or concert platform, yet still wants to be creative with
shooting angles.

Its small size makes it suited to remotely controlled or robotic
applications such as parliamentary broadcasting, where it is
discreet in operation, as well as to crane and jib use.

The Microcam is the only compact camera on the market that is
available in 16/9 format today.

The new 4005 Dockable Betacam SX recorder is connected to the 1657
camera in the same way as the 3505 Betacam SP recorder, with
digital recording to maintain the quality of the picture produced
by the 1657.

Recording is 4:2:2 digital component at 8 bit resolution, using the
MPEG-2 4:2:2 Studio Profile level compression algorithm.

SGI DEBUTS MULTI-CHANNEL SERVER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Silicon Graphics has announced that it will debut its Multi-Channel
Playback (MCP). The MCP Server enables the management, scheduling
and playout of multiple-channels of stored MPEG-2 compressed
digital video, audio and data.

The MCP Server is designed to meet the needs of multi-channel
service providers such as broadcast, satellite and cable TV
networks and operators.

In addition to the expansion of the traditional broadcast market,
multi-channel playout is key to the growth of the emerging Near
Video on Demand (NVOD) market, which offers viewers closely
staggered start times of movies as well as special pay-per-view
events.

The enabling technology of the MCP Server is Silicon Graphics
multi-channel playback software. The software's open, object-
oriented architecture is completely scaleable, allowing from 10 to
over 300 output streams and more than 1,000 hours of compressed
video storage.

The MCP software is network-independent, supporting any network
topology. Networks supported include satellite and terrestrial
services such as Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services and
Hybrid-Fibre Coax .

The MCP Server will be generally available in January 1997.

TEK LIGHTWORKS VIP 4500 AT IBC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Designed to bring the benefits of the nonlinear revolution to the
owners and users of online suites, the Lightworks VIP 4500 editing
system - the first of a new generation of online broadcast editing
solutions from Tektronix - was launched at IBC '96.

Aimed at replacing conventional multiple-VTR online tape-based
editing systems in broadcast television and facilities companies
the Lightworks VIP 4500 system offers a smooth and cost-effective
migration path to the non-linear world.

The new system has full capabilities to control external devices -
such as DVEs, vision mixers (switchers) and character generators -
as well as offering its own complementary on-board titling and
effects. The system complements Tektronix' existing range of
offline and news editing systems (Lightworks Turbo, Heavyworks and
Newsworks systems - and the new Newsworks Turbo, simultaneously
launched at IBC '96. (See page 40)

Targeted initially at online finishing of broadcast television
projects, it features recording and playout configurable via
multiple fully-assignable broadcast-quality video channels. The
system also combines comprehensive offline and online facilities
suitable for all forms of editing. Priced at US$149,950 for its
core four channel configuration, key launch customers include
Sweden's TV4 and the UK's Central Television.

First shipments began after IBC, with world-wide availability by
end-1996.

IT'S A KIND OF CONVERGENCE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Neal Weinstock

Network computers" that incorporate digital video decoders. Full-
motion video on Internet sites. TV tuner cards and MPEG decoder
cards for home PCs. Video capture programmes that allow typical
home users to grab frames, customise still images, and build their
own digital photo libraries.

Consumer nonlinear editing systems from Avid Technology, Radius,
Fast Electronic, and many others. The PC and the TV are cross-
breeding in consumers' homes, mutating into multiple new forms, and
the TV industry may never be the same again.

Or, some of the new creations may not work at all in the
marketplace.

The Network Computer

Look at the new concept of the network computer (NC). It was
invented by Oracle chief Larry Ellison in a speech in 1994 - in
what he has said was a spur-of-the-moment inspiration - though
naysayers insist the concept of underpowered PCs relying on
mainframes to supply data has been around as long as the used
computer market.

Ellison challenged the hardware industry with the goal of building
a device with nothing more than a keyboard, lots of RAM, some ROM
chips to hold the small client side of a big client/server
operating system, and a very fast processor.

The unit would rely on a network for storage of all programmes and
on a TV screen as monitor, and could therefore sell for US$500, he
said.

The NC was embraced by IBM soon after Ellison's speech. After all,
it is essentially a re-awakening of the mainframe/dumb terminal
model that prevailed when Big Blue ran the computer industry.

From Receivers to Computers

It was also embraced by consumer electronics companies such as Sony
and Philips as a bridge from their stagnant TV receiver trade into
the home computer business. Sony and Philips became early
manufacturers of terminals for the start-up WebTV (which also sells
terminals under its own name).

For US$3300 to US$350, the three companies have just introduced
WebTV terminals that include V.34 modems, software for easy
Internet access (for a monthly fee of US$20), and the ability to
connect numerous add-ons such as a wireless keyboard, hard disk and
CD-ROM.

Ellison's call was echoed from a distance by the drive towards
digital TV decoders. As the needs of the rival systems aimed at
Europe and the North American hybrid digital/analogue standard
became clear, these decoders also were seen to require ROM loaded
with the client side of a network operating system and a very fast
processor. But they don't need much, or any, RAM, and they need
only a keypad, rather than a keyboard. They certainly use the TV as
monitor, though.

Linking Up With Decoders

So some of the companies that took Ellison up on his challenge,
including Sun Microsystems and Sony, began to confer with or even
join forces with the decoder makers, such as Thomson and Irdeto.

"We might combine the digital TV decoder and the network computer,"
says a Sun insider, "or we might just design them together and use
the efficiencies to drive down costs."

Sun has been drawn into these opportunities by its Java and Hot
Java software; that hot Internet stuff suddenly seems to make at
least as much sense for digital TV as similar software aimed at our
industry in recent years by the likes of Apple and IBM's now
defunct Kaleida co-venture, Microware's David, Irdeto, Philips, and
News Datacom.

But if digital TV decoders are to be like Internet terminals, they
also can be Internet terminals. And, as the bandwidth of the
Internet expands, as "applet" software such as Java improves, and
as streaming servers improve, TV programmes will increasingly be
delivered over the Internet.

TV Over the Internet

They already are, in low quality and quantity. As reported here
recently, such streamer software companies as Vosaic (in
combination with Microsoft and its Java-competitor Active X), Xing
Technology, VDOnet, and Vivo Software are already sending MPEG-
quality video at up to 15fps to ISDN connections anywhere on the
globe.

A network computer that is combined in one module with a digital TV
decoder could let viewers switch channels from broadcast to an
Internet video stream.

Some broadcasters are getting ready for this eventuality.

"Right now, a Web site is an ancillary service," says Steven Heyer,
president/CEO of Turner Advertising Sales and chief of Turner's
international networks. "People can find out TV schedules, more
about news stories or spots. At some point, the Web site becomes
the entertainment or the product, and the TV network is equally
ancillary."

Opening Up the Markets

Because of the Internet's global reach, wherever on earth wideband
Internet to the home happens, it's simultaneously an opportunity
for broadcasters anywhere and a threat to broadcasters in that
locality.

For example, hundreds of thousands of homes throughout California's
Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay area now have Internet
connections at least over 128 kbps ISDN.

Millions more are wired at 28.8 kbps or lower. According to media
buyers in the area, up to 20 per cent of the prime time TV audience
in the area - probably the most extensively computer-literate
region on earth - is lost to computer network usage on any given
night. Local TV advertising consequences are inevitable, even as
such new networking concerns as WebTV, C/net and @home base their
business plans on supplying Internet services with increasing
amounts of video to the "lost" TV audience.

Yet there are naysayers to the combined digital TV decoder/network
computer. Divicom, the MPEG specialist that is a subsidiary of
leading MPEG and JPEG chip-maker C-Cube Microsystems, has just
signed a contract to supply technology for Zenith Electronics' US$1
billion contract to supply digital set-tops to the Ameritech
consortium of US telephone companies.

The new decoders are to work on several digital video standards so
consumers can switch from the hybrid fibre coax (HFC) standard used
by American cable operators to the switched digital video (SDV)
used by telcos, to MMDS or DTH standards, too.

No Reasonable Price

There will not be room left in such a box to provide the Ethernet
node used for high-speed modems and the network computer, too - at
least not at a reasonable price.

"Advanced digital video delivery systems and services are difficult
to build and implement," says Divicom president/CEO Nolan Daines.

He emphasises a need to, "Minimise the complexity and reduce the
costs associated with implementing such systems, . . . and bring a
complete solution to the market in a fraction of the time."

Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bill Gates lambastes the idea of the network
computer. "If people really want underpowered PC's without hard
drives, why can't you even give away most used computers? It's a
fallacy," he said in a recent speech.

Yet Microsoft, too, has embraced the NC, especially for the home TV
monitor as display. It is backing the Florida start-up, Citrix, in
developing software for "thin client" client/server systems
compatible with Active X (formerly known as OLE).

This is to be the fulfilment of the model Microsoft bruited about
the cable industry a couple of years ago for interactive TV, then
called "Tiger." It is also meant to support home office workers on
NCs. The concept has been embraced, too, by several market-share
leaders in PCs, including the top company, Compaq.

By coincidence, however, this journalist just purchased his first
new desktop computer in five years, a Compaq, and was pleased to
obtain, for some US$500 less than his last Compaq four years ago,
not only a hugely faster processor but 80 times as much hard drive,
four times as much RAM, MPEG video, TV tuner, 8x CD-ROM drive, some
600Mb of software and all other usual bells and whistles.

A journalist does not need all of this stuff for work, but it does
allow a journalist to access all manner of graphical Internet
sites, and allow a journalist's family to learn from hybrid CD-ROMs
combining with Internet sites to supply video-like services with
interactivity.

The fat client competes with TV rather than augments it, and is
often preferable for those who can afford it (while becoming ever
easier to afford): my son has not watched television since the new
computer was delivered.

Merging Industries?

Clearly, Compaq places its bets on this kind of product as well as
NCs. So is Sony, which not only has just introduced its WebTV NC,
but also, just a few weeks before, its re-entry into the
traditional PC business.

Peter Dare, technology VP for Sony Business & Professional
Products, says, "When the PCs in Sony's booth at NAB outnumber the
VTRs, you know we should be selling PCs. These industries are
merging.

"There's going to be a continuum from PCs running home multimedia
to professional production systems on PCs, and we should be on both
sides of that."

In other words, just as Sony used its strength in home VCRs to help
it conquer professional recording.

Networked "Fat" Clients

The fully loaded PC (or "fat client,") poses other challenges and
opportunities for broadcasters. The challenges are mostly the same
as those offered by thin clients. But the fat client market seems
pretty clearly defined as likely to encompass just the top third of
most societies' demographic audiences (A and B demos, as TV
programmers put it), while home NCs, or thin clients, threaten
viewership at all but the least lucrative demos.

Fat clients may seem, on quick examination, to offer fewer
opportunities for broadcasters and more for equipment vendors. Not
many PC owners are likely to view TV entertainment at their
desktops; my son's TV-like usage of CD-ROM and Internet is not
benefiting any broadcaster.

But he is likely to graduate from his current diet of learn-to-read
games fairly quickly to learn- to-make-your-own-video devices;
Avid, Sony, Eastman Kodak, and others are now vying to supply him
with those devices.

The growth of the fat client business around the world will help
turn the home multimedia industry to the benefit of these TV
equipment makers, whose high-end nonlinear edit, digital recording,
and graphics creation software of just a few years ago now runs on
hardware within consumer budgets.

Even more than the large companies mentioned above, Radius, Fast
Electronic, DPS, Matrox, Autodesk, Adobe, and other smaller board
or software makers have predicated their business plans on bringing
broadcast post- production tools to home users.

What's Coming?

This strategy melds with a professional equipment strategy, too.
Says Pete Mountanos, marketing VP of Fast, "You don't know what's
coming in a year or two, but you know it's going to make your
$50,000 or $100,000 systems obsolete. So just buy a $1,000 board
from us and throw it out once you find something better."

One large software company is playing something of this strategy,
too. Microsoft has priced Softimage software at a third or less
than its 1995 levels, and expects to drive prices still lower, well
below its current US$10,000 to $20,000 level.

Softimage availability over Windows NT is a major factor in the
tremendous growth of Pentium Pro-based systems on the hardware
side. Dell Computer has just introduced a US$2,500 Pentium Pro
system running Windows NT, and capable of running Softimage. This
may be a very thin client compared to the Silicon Graphics systems
it may be used to emulate, but only a moderately fat client for the
average home PC buyer.

Buying Into Broadcasting

Combine it with a video camera and a very few thousand dollars
worth of Internet site creation and streaming software, and the
home PC becomes a small broadcasting station.

Surely it is significant that Microsoft has bought into
broadcasting, too, as half owner of MSNBC, a supplier of
programming to NBC's Asian networks and a 24-hour broadcaster in
the US.

The company wants its Microsoft Network online service and Internet
connection to mix and match ancillary and complementary programming
with MSNBC, and it is not shy about defining its programming as an
enabler for consumers' own programmes as well as for its own wholly
originated feeds.

For the traditional broadcasters, this is a new model which would
bear watching.

Of more long-term competitive effect for broadcasters, when
consumers get used to producing their own good-quality video, and
then distributing it on Internet sites as well as viewing video on
other 'net sites, they are likely to insist on demanding something
more from TV broadcasters than now available. What more? Only time
will tell.  '

PSN SHINES OVER THE ASIA-PACIFIC PT PASIFIK SATELIT NUSANTARA, ESTABLISHED
IN 1991 TO PROVIDE SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, CONTINUES TO FORGE AHEAD

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Thomas King

Ever since all systems were declared "go" and Palapa A1 was
rocketed into orbit in July 1976 Indonesia has become a leader in
satellite telecoms.

With that giant leap forward 20 years ago the nation joined an
exclusive high technology 'club' as one of the first Third World
countries to use space technology.

The plan then was to effectively and efficiently link all parts of
the lengthy Indonesian archipelago with a modern telecommunications
network.

Not only would the network have to support telex, radio, television
and data transmissions and serve the nation's burgeoning number of
telephone users, it would also have to rely upon the then
revolutionary idea of using a tiny satellite in stationary orbit
some 36,000km above Indonesia.

The sparkle of the 250kg Palapa A1 was superseded in the mid 1980s
with the shimmer of the B2 series of spacecraft which became the
second generation platforms for a highly sophisticated
telecommunications network.

Several 550kg B2 satellites were progressively launched into
different orbits and after extensive testing proved their value as
distant repeater stations equipped with enhanced capabilities and
agendas.

With the introduction of the more sophisticated Palapa B series it
was decided that its various footprints should be intended for end
users in the vast ASEAN region, in addition to its prime service
market of Indonesia.

The Palapa B series launched reliable satellite communications to
hundreds of millions of people living in the then six member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN):
Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. (Vietnam has since joined the organisation, which
regularly meets to discuss regional matters, including telecoms
issues.

1991: Forging Ahead

Until 1991 Indonesia had but one private satellite service
provider, the company now known as Satelindo. PT Pasifik Satelit
Nusantara (PSN) was established in June 1991 with a mandate to
provide satellite-based products and services to the Asia-Pacific
region.

The five-year old publicly-owned company not only compliments the
satellite-based portfolio of Indonesian sister company, PT
Satelindo, but has successfully forged ahead with interests in a
number of telecoms enterprises.

For instance, just one year after its establishment PSN acquired
the 'retired' inclined orbit B1 satellite at 134 degrees E, renamed
it Palapa Pacific 1, and began operating services with an expanded
coverage over Asia from India in the West to Guam in the East.

The second satellite in the B2 series, the inclined orbit B2P came
under PSN management in early 1996. Renamed Palapa Pacific 2 and
relocated to 144 degrees E, PSN's ten standard C-band transponders
on this orbiting relay station are predominately leased by the
Mabuhay Philippines Satellite Corporation for telecommunications
and broadcast purposes.

Third Generation Satellites

PSN is also actively involved in Indonesia's third generation of
satellites, Palapa C1 and C2, which were launched in January and
May 1996, respectively.

A number of innovations and advances were incorporated into the
high power C series which, like the B series, was built by the
Hughes Space and Communications Company of California.

For instance, each 1740kg, 21m long Palapa C has more powerful
transmitters and highly refined antennas. Satellite life for the C
series is estimated at 14 years, virtually double that of the B
series.

"Through a joint purchase agreement with PT Satelindo, PSN owns and
operates 12 extended C-band transponders, six on each of two Hughes
HS601 Palapa C series satellites," said Ron Pirolo, Manager-Sales &
CS, Pasifik Satelit Nusantara.

Palapa C2: More TV Traffic

The C1, at 150.5 degrees E, is primarily used to carry rural
telephony on PSN's burgeoning VSAT service. Positioned at 113
degrees E, C2 is dedicated to broadcasting needs. Pirolo estimates
that up to two million parabolic dish antennas are currently
pointed at this satellite, which is claimed to carry more TV
traffic - 30 major broadcasters - than any other satellite in the
region.

PSN's Palapa C customers include broadcasters such as NBC Asia,
Star TV, TVB Hong Kong and RCTI, the dominant broadcaster in
Indonesia.

Footprint flexibility is an advantage for users of PSN
transponders, noted Pirolo, as they can opt for either of Palapa C
coverage patterns, the Asean beam or the Asia beam. In combination
these span the distance from East Africa in the West to New Zealand
in the East.

More Transponders Soon

In a few months PSN will be able to offer additional transponders
to users on yet another satellite, the soon-to-be-launched Mabuhay
1, the first-ever Philippine satellite.

One of eight partners that make up the Mabuhay Philippines
Satellite Corporation, PSN currently owns two transponders with an
option to acquire an additional six.

Developed and built by Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) of  the US,
Mahubay 1 is scheduled for launch this December. It is expected to
become operational from 144 degrees E orbital position during the
first quarter of 1997. (This position will put Mabuhay 1 in a co-
location with PSN's Palapa Pacific 2 until the end of service life
for the Indonesian satellite.

Designed for a 12 year operational life, Mahubay 1, the largest
space craft in SS/L's FS1300 series, is equipped with 54 active
transponders in the C- and Ku-bands.

A total of 30 high power standard and extended C-band transponders
and orthogonally polarised antennas will provide coverage to the
Philippines, Eastern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Indo-China, Japan,
Korea, India, Bangladesh and Hawaii.

On the Ku-band, Mabuhay 1 will operate with 24 medium power/12 high
power transponders to cover the Philippines, coastal China, Taiwan
and northern Vietnam.

While PSN executives are actively involved in this pioneering
project others are deployed elsewhere to direct additional company
interests.

There are currently three other components in PSN's evolving
portfolio of satellite-related services: teleport services,
satellite network services and planned mobile satellite services.

Uplinking in Batam

In early 1994 and within three months after being awarded its first
satellite uplink contract, PSN technicians had designed, installed
and commissioned an uplink facility on Batam Island, near
Singapore. This signalled the start of the first commercial,
digitally compressed TV service in Asia.

The Batam Teleport was expanded in late 1995 to accommodate
additional operational requirements for the Palapa C satellites.
The facility now provides satellite monitoring, uplink and downlink
services, digital compression and editing services as well as
limited studio capabilities.

PSN's Teleport customers include clients such as NBC Asia which
uses the Batam complex for the downlinking of its broadcast service
off PAS-2, processing and uplinking to C2.

In the satellite network services arena PSN has teamed with Titan
Information Services to offer a "very cost effective, satellite-
based communications network".

Incorporating DAMALink software and hardware which actively assigns
frequencies to maximise satellite bandwidth efficiency, the Xpress
connection system is said to reduce costs by enabling more users to
be simultaneously served by a narrower bandwidth segment.

Voice, data and facsimile transmissions can be processed by this
system, which uses extended C-band frequencies and 1.2m earth-based
VSAT terminals.

AceS by 1998

While Batam Teleport and Xpress Connection are fully operational,
PSN's Asia Cellular Satellite (AceS) System will only come on-line
in 1998.

Conceived as a satellite-based, mobile communication system
providing fully digital voice, data, fax, alerting and paging
services to hand-held telephones anywhere in Asia, the system will
be seamlessly integrated with cellular networks and public switched
networks.

Apart from supplying cellular-like mobile services, ACeS will have
the ability to deliver telecommunications services to the
innumerable underserved and unserved rural locations throughout
Asia. Ericsson will develop and manufacture the satellite/ cellular
switched phones.

The workhorses of the orbiting system, currently under construction
by  Lockheed Martin, are the 2600kg A2100 AX spacecraft buses, said
to be the most powerful commercial communications satellites ever
built.

Dubbed 'Garuda' and sporting 12m long antennas and on-board digital
signal processing both of the 12 year service life satellites in
the ACeS system will have 140 spot beams focussed in Asia. The
footprints will cover in excess of 25 countries where a total
population of approximately three billion people live.

Each of the L-band satellites is designed to provide 11,000
simultaneous telephone channels and be capable of supporting up to
two million subscribers.

The Satellite Control Facility on Batam will contain the hardware
including a 15.5m tracking antenna, software and support facilities
necessary to manage and monitor the two massive Garuda satellites
of the heart of this revolutionary mobile communications system.

Towards 1999

In mid-October PSN announced plans to operate a multimedia
satellite by 1999.

Currently under constructionby the Lorel Corporation, the four-
tonne US$300 million satellite, to be called Palapa Pacific 3 and
positioned at 134 degrees E, "will not have any transponders,
although its capacity will be equivalent to that of a satellite
with 84 transponders.

The satellite is expected to be sent aloft in late 1998 or early
1999.  '

CHARISMATIC DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING: MARTYN GREEN TALKS TO QUESTECH'S GRAEME
FENEMORE AND ROBERT BILLING ABOUT THE CHARISMA X DVE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Situated in Wokingham, Berks, the heart of Britain's Silicon
Valley, Questech are the makers of such AV products as rate
converters, high quality decoders, and frame store synchronisers,
along with a solid-state video RAM recorder, and a solid-state
audio recorder.

But perhaps more than anything, it is known for its flagship
product, the Charisma X (Ten), a dual-standard and dual-aspect
ratio digital video effects device which they claim, "has the
highest frame-based interpolation in the industry, rendering
digital video effects images in real time".

According to Questech's sales support manager, Graeme Fenemore, the
Charisma X has been Questech's main product for the past year - and
by now Questech has sold, "a fair number" of them.

The basic model comes with an input and output mixer and a linear
DVE with three axis rotations. The input mixer comes as standard,
along with RGB colour correction, de-focus, luminance-chrominance,
and key.

Prices start off at about 37,000 (US$55,500) for the basic model,
up to 56,000  (US$84,000) for a single-channel device, although up
to three channels can be controlled from the same system.

Having three channels allows a display of three different video
sources on screen. "If you look at the news on TV," he explains
"sometimes they have two presenters, in different locations, in
different boxes on-screen - and that is two channels of DVE.

"We offer a third one also - all mixed over a background which can
be live."

The basic, linear model, has infinite expansion, and to this wrap
and warp effects can be added to do page turns and page rolls, or
oil drop ripple effects. "But it is all a 2-D image," explains
Fenemore.

"It appears as 3-D with the picture flat to the screen, but if you
rotate the picture around in 3-D space, it will appear as a flat
image.

"That also allows infinite expansion, because it is just an
additional board that is added to the system.

"If you want 3-D effects, where you have page turns, you can rotate
the image around in space and it will remain three-dimensional."

An extra board can be fitted to the entry-level CLEO, to allow
expansion on a flat picture up to eight times and three times on
CLEO effects.

"CLEO stands for the Curved Line Effects option - the 3-D stuff,"
explains Fenemore. There is a 5,000 pound add-on card that can be
added to the system to make it a super-CLEO.

This allows expansion of shapes up to eight times. "It also allows
you to fragment the picture, roll it into a cylinder or a cone,"
says Fenemore, adding "all real-time manipulation, as there is no
rendering involved with the Charisma system."

Saving Time In Rendering

He points out, "Unless you spend half a million pounds, with a lot
of the computer-based systems, you tend to find you have to set one
key frame, generate another key frame, and then let the system
render, going from one to the other on a frame-by-frame basis,
which does take time.

"But with the Charisma X, for instance you can set a key frame,
turn it into a sphere, and then rotate it around in 3-D space and
it remains 3-D.

"Or you can position it somewhere else, set a second key frame, and
when you run it, it will evolve from one shape to the other.
Normally on a computer-based system, you find it has to render
frame by frame.

"A lot of this stuff is done in hardware - it is not from
programmes that have been written to generate them, although
obviously there is software that is written to control the
hardware."

Operating Live-On-Air

Computer-based systems do work out cheaper, Fenemore admits, as a
lot of them come with other packages, like graphics and character
generators, all packaged with digital video effects.

"So you can have a complete editing system in a box, whereas the
Charisma X has to link up with other manufacturer's devices like
mixers, edit controllers and character generators."

However, he points out, "Where you wouldn't want to use a computer-
based system is when you are operating live on-air. If you want to
fire off an effect, like moving a picture away into the background,
then you'd obviously want to use a dedicated piece of hardware for
that.

"With the computer-based systems, you can't separate the DVE - it
is all in a box. You wouldn't use a computer-based system to
manipulate a picture on the TV screen on a live broadcast.

"Computer-based systems are used in post-production houses, where
speed of operation is not the most important thing, although
obviously a customer is paying by the hour for the use of the
product."

Disk vs RAM

The advantage of computer-based systems though, he agrees, are that
one can add graphics to the video. "But a computer-based system
uses disk drives, whereas our system has no disks - all the images
are stored in RAM memory.

"You are manipulating one frame of information, that's all. There
is one frame, or a field, delay, because you may have a pixel in
the top left which has to appear on the bottom right. It is frame-
based processing, which means that when you expand the image, you
don't have the slight flicker you get with field-based processing."

The Charisma Ten system comes as an input-output mixer, with the
DVE inside. "To that you can add the wrap or warp type effects
which are 2-D in plane effects, or you can have the CLEO and have
3-D effects, where you can manipulate the picture - like doing
page-turns, making into a sphere or cylinder etc., and it remains
three-dimensional."

Available Options

Options that can be added to the system include the ability to drop
images into a target frame store - what Questech call multi-freeze.

Says Fenemore, "You can build up montages by dropping in
information. Or you can generate a drop shadow effect, and de-focus
it. You can leave trails, much like you see on some computer
cursors, and you can decay the trail away or leave it on the
screen.

"You can also add a chroma-key, and chroma-key the DVE onto another
input source, and manipulate the combined images on-screen."

The Charisma has been around as a digital box since 1985. And
Fenemore claims that companies who bought one then, are still using
them nowadays. The earlier model to the Charisma X was an eight-
bit, field-based device, while the Charisma X is ten-bit frame-
based.

The internal architecture of the DV goes up to 24 bits and is
digitally transparent, "- so that with a full-sized centre, you can
freeze the video, and actually feed its output back into its input,
unfreeze it, and the picture will remain on screen."

What is new with the Charisma Ten is the input mixer, along with
the chroma- key option and the wrap or warp effects. "And with the
wrap system, you can get real-time morphing," enthuses Fenemore,
"so you can distort a picture in real time."

"You can do a two-channel morph, from one shape to another and you
can see it happening in front of you by moving a grid around, to
change it on the output screen, and then instantly run it, with no
rendering involved."

Unfortunately, he says, users cannot have both the CLEO and the
wrap systems in the same unit, as they are totally different
address architecture. "But you can combine channels so you have one
channel with the CLEO, and another with the wrap, because you can
have up to three channels."

Asked what sort of customers go for each type of system, he says,
"You tend to find that the morphing effects being used by post
production houses, whereas the wrap and CLEO effects can be used in
either environment."

"The multi-channel combining, and Z-axis information which allows
you to manipulate one channel behind another, without having to do
a priority select, or intersect other channels, has been around
since the launch of the first Charisma in 1985."

And he maintains that whereas Quantel were the first to generate a
three-axis rotate system, which Ampex followed with a three-axis
video manipulator, there was still no ability to do three-axis
rotations, and Questech is still "really the only manufacturer that
makes a DVE that can do all of these sort things in 3-D, in real
time."

Switching Between Events

Robert Billing, senior design engineer at Questech, feels the
Charisma X is useful, "for any sort of programme where you need
transitions.

"With sports programmes, for instance, the Charisma X can be used
most effectively to switch between all the different events during
the day. And we are now able to do 525/60 NTSC as well as 625/50
PAL, so we are getting into the American-dominated section of the
market."

Billings continues, " I don't think it would be easy for anyone to
try to copy us. We have extensive patent protection . . . "
Questech thus believes it has the market virtually cornered. And,
currently at least, it is sitting pretty on it.  '

THE GREAT OUTDOORS BECKON: UNTIL YOU START BATTLING TO BRING THE STORIES
IN, YOU MAY NOT NEED MUCH MORE THAN THIS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Neal Weinstock

Mobile facilities are starting to move across Asia, as audience
ratings begin to give a tangible edge to the immediacy of location
shooting. Advertisers are taking notice, too, which leads
broadcasters to add yet more outdoor broadcast (OB) vans to their
technology resources.

In cold countries, this is called a snowball effect; but the OB van
trend is rolling and gathering size largely in places that never
see snow. What's a mobile facility? At its least, it's simply a van
- even a car -  used to hold portable production equipment.

"Until you get into a situation where you're battling competitors
to bring stories in," says Rob Braun of Phoenix ENG, a small US OB
van specialist, "You don't need much more than that for news."

Sport, however, is a different arena. Yet another is fiction
production. Broadcasters with rights to sporting events in more
than one or two venues in a typical year, and producers of
entertainment programmes that might experience a ratings boost from
a bit of outside-the-studio scenery, have differing and immediate
needs in OB vans.

That is why mobile facilities are best designed to order and
crafted for each special need. That is why, as much as large system
integrating vendors such as Sony, BTS, and Harris seem to dominate
the business, well over 50 per cent of the world's mobile
facilities are built by small local vendors.

There tends to be as much individuality among properly designed OB
vans as between in-house studio facilities. The differences are not
merely a matter of budget.

Do you need (and can you get government permission for) a microwave
link to the studio? Are you rolling the OB van into or just outside
of large arenas, concert halls, or night clubs? Or are you using it
to navigate narrow streets, pedestrian districts, off-road
countryside?

Depending on what programme is being shot, the same location may
require a different sort of vehicle.

In this author's photogenic and news-generating neighbourhood, we
are continually visited by every sort of mobile production. The
differences and similarities are highly instructive.

Frequent fiction film crews bring a dozen or more caravans (for
people only) and lorries (for equipment only), and no on-board
control room; all is set out in the open on the street.

The shoot costs millions, costs all of us locals our parking spots
and makes us occasionally wait to get in or out of our houses while
we gawk at actors, but the vans cost little; they are unimproved
trucks and mobile homes.

There are always local TV news vans around, their corkscrew-shaped
microwave antennae raised up to 30m to transmit video from the
squares in front of courthouses and government offices (or
sometimes from a waterside location for a weather report) to
studios.

Usually these are vans about four or five metres long, with room
inside for an AB roll editing system, driver, cameraman, editor,
and journalist, a portable light kit, a couple of camcorders, tape
and accessories, and a football field's length of cables.

Added on to the cost of a normal delivery van are an improved
electrical system, built-in microwave, countertops and cabinets,
and endless coffee spills.

Foreign TV correspondents based here are frequently out shooting
video in the neighbourhood, too. Typically, they stand in front of
a vista that tells the world where they are and deliver monologues
that may have been written without ever coming here.

Or they stand on the street interviewing celebrities from their
homeland who now live here, inadvertently demonstrating that no one
in my neighbourhood recognises them. For these applications,
unobtrusive politeness is needed in any OB van; usually, they use
station wagons well stuffed with camera, tripod, mini-lighting kit,
VTR, tape and accessories.

Lately, we are seeing more sport-utility vehicles used; they more
easily handle a bounce over a curb in the wilds of our
neighbourhood's pedestrian walkways, especially when heavily
loaded.

We have seen NHK crews with a hand-held microwave link stuffed into
the wagon, too; they can use it only in locations with a clear shot
at a receiver mounted high on an office building.

The inexperienced try to get away with packing only cameraman and
journalist in with all this; older hands include a driver, useful
mostly to guard against thieves and tow trucks.

TV commercials, fashion videos, and music videos are another
menagerie. Typically, all three travel in a four- or five-metre OB
van for video gear and online control, a caravan or two for talent,
and a big truck full of lights and often audio.

We know as soon as the truck doors open if the shoot is on film or
video: film shoots fill trucks with so many lights and generators
and reflectors and scrims and big gel filters that little else is
apparent, and they need no other van for video control. Video set-
ups can be pretty similar to TV news crews', with the addition of
roughly the same lighting gear as a film crew's. And no microwave,
of course.

For fashion and music video shoots, too, there's usually a full
complement of hi-fi audio gear; less often, performance sound
reinforcement gear. Though performers in music videos usually lip-
sync sound tracks in the studio to mimed singing on location, they
need loud enough audio to dance to.

Models in fashion shoots, likewise, need loud enough audio to walk
to. Actors in commercials may need this, too. Or they may need no
more audio than a wireless body microphone.

Given the diversity of needs and the relative infrequency of work
for all participants (compared, say, to TV news), these
applications almost always are serviced by rented vehicles; an
extra reason to keep the OB video control van separate from the
lighting equipment truck.

Crews that tend to be unfamiliar with equipment resources need
more, and more clearly defined, space to work with.

Location Shoots For Concerts

Then there are the location shoots for music concerts. MTV had an
all-star concert in the park where I like to run a few weeks ago.
Small crews from a non-profit channel sometimes come to shoot
chamber music concerts in a little hall just next to that park.

The two shoots' OB van needs could hardly be more different and yet
alike in concept. Both require trucks holding fully equipped
control rooms for multicamera shoots. The trucks must be parked
some distance from the stage, in both cases, so that the director
sees talent only over video.

In the case of the chamber music hall, a five-metre OB van sits in
a nearby parking lot and runs cables to a three-camera set-up in
the hall. Within the single OB van are stored precisely all the
lights, camera, and other portable gear needed for the shoot.

Since the crew comes here with some frequency, they know just what
they need and are able to transport most of it in a van that also
holds the three-camera control set-up, switcher, VTR, et al. Some
additional gear they are able to store in a closet in the little
hall.

In the case of the rock concert, two huge tractor-trailers,
accompanied by several vehicles for performers' dressing rooms,
filled a cobbled no- parking zone.

As many as a dozen cameras were used, necessitating a huge control
room that filled one of the trailers, taking up more space than
most control rooms in permanent, indoor facilities.

Of course, the trailer is a permanent facility, too, used for
sporting events if not rock concerts, and costing many millions of
dollars. The second huge trailer, filled with generators for
lights, stood farther from the stage to minimise the generators'
noise.

Other lorries that had brought other gear probably were parked far
away during the show. For days before and after, running through
the park was a challenging obstacle course. If most of these OB van
applications have not been seen in your neighbourhood, rest assured
that many soon will be.

"Anybody would rather watch anything that comes from outside the
studio," says Moses Znaimer, founder and chairman of Toronto's City
TV. "There's always the slightest possibility for surprise, for
some kind of life sneaking into the bleak, pre- programmed dead
zone of television."

City TV was a little independent upstart broadcaster a decade ago;
it made its mark against the established stations (and saved vast
costs) by not having any studios at all. Everything it did was
location work, even within its own offices.

The company now sells its expertise to other broadcasters, to help
others work the same formula. But nugget of City TV's strategy is
not patentable and inescapable: many viewers would rather see OB
video than studio video. As more and more competition comes to
Asian TV, the great outdoors beckon.  '

THE REALITY OF VIRTUAL STUDIOS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Virtual Set technology at IBC 96 did not have quite the 'must see'
quality it certainly had when the first blue screen sets startled
visitors back in 1994 - but there have certainly been some advances
this year which go some way to solving some of the complex
technical problems of virtual production.

There are buyers around - and at least one manufacturer confidently
claims 1997 will be the year of the virtual set - but didn't
someone say that about 1996?

There also has not been quite the shake-out of virtual set
companies yet, although Electrogig has vanished from the pantheon
of names, Its Reality Tracking technology has been acquired by
Triavest, a new company set up by former Electrogig chief executive
Mike Dilworth, and largely staffed by ex-Electrogig virtual set
specialists.

Triavest plans to spend far more time building the specific
requirements of its customers into the virtual set systems it
delivers - more of a custom-made approach. It was acknowledged last
year that there were too many companies chasing a fairly small
market - since that market was limited by the high cost of entry.

Now the market is being segmented into high and lower cost systems;
broadly the split between a 2D virtual studio without a tracking
camera, with pre-rendered sets manipulated by a high resolution
DVE; and the full 3D real time rendered virtual set, which in most
cases still requires a Silicon Graphics Onyx supercomputer - now
available with the Infinite Reality graphics engine which is some
ten times faster than SGI's previous model, the Reality Engine 2.

It was notable that Discreet Logic did not have a virtual set
display at IBC. It made great play of its Vapour, Frost and Glass
product lines at NAB this year, but following DL's re-structuring,
the IBC focus was on editing with Fire, and mid-price effects and
compositing with the Flint RT (for real time), helped by DL's first
hardware product, the Pebbles fast video i/o device.

However, Discreet says the absence of a Vapour demo does not imply
any less commitment towards virtual sets. It's still an important
part of its strategy for broadcast products, according to
Discreet's director of product marketing Marc Nadeau.

"Vapour and Frost are a key part of our development into production
for broadcast and we're currently transitioning the technology
research from Innsbruck to Montreal as part of the re-structuring.

"We just didn't have enough time to organise a blue screen
demonstration at IBC, but we showed the software and rendering
environment - and this year we've had 1500 hours on air generated
by Vapour, including the Eurovision Song Contest and 22 hours a day
from the Olympics for Canal Plus."

RT-SET has just signed a deal with SZM Sendezentrum Munchen for
three licences for its top end virtual studio system Larus, which
makes SZM the biggest user of virtual set technology yet, according
to RT-SET president and CEO Shalom Nachshon.

SZM acts as a production centre for four TV stations in Germany -
Pro7, the DSF sports channel, Home Order Television and the Kabel 1
movies and entertainment channel. SZM will be using three studio
cameras and a crane camera in its virtual studio facility.

"We've turned concepts into real production tools this year, and
proved it with productions like CBS TV's Tales of the Crypt, where
we did 26 episodes of the show in eight days," he says.

This involved RT-SET virtual sets mixed in with live action and
ainimation for a part of this children's show from the Samuel
Goldwyn Company called Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House.

"We've completed the development of centralising the entire
function of virtual set control room into one point - the virtual
studio operator - so the switching of cameras, controlling VTRs,
lighting, sound are all controlled by one guy who controls the
show," says Nachshon.

RT-SET has also completed development of software to generate
shadows from the talent and cast them not only on the floor, but on
virtual objects too, according to Nachshon.

"We don't have to use any blue boxes for this, and the cameras can
move too," he says. RT-SET has also devised a 3D prompter as
guidance for the talent, so they can watch where they are supposed
to move without the use of a monitor.

Orad Hi-Tec Systems has continued to export its technology to other
virtual set companies. Several now offer Orad's pattern recognition
system as an alternative to using memory head sensors in deriving
the co-ordinates to generate the right perspectives for the
computer graphics backgrounds.

Accom, Digimedia and Discreet Logic have all agreed with Orad to
interface its camera tracking system with their virtual set
systems. Orad now has a range of its Cyberset virtual set systems
at different price points, some entirely in-house systems, some
with partners like FOR-A, Vinten and Evans and Sutherland, which
offers a Windows NT based system.

"When we started developing a virtual studio system, we began using
a sensor-based system, but got so frustrated with it, we looked at
other methods and developed pattern recognition, where the camera
parameters are extracted from the video itself, not from any
associated mechanical devices.

"It means you can use ordinary studio cameras, you can dolly them
freely and even use shoulder mounted cameras or a Steadicam. And
since our video processor is located downstream of the switcher,
one system can service any number of cameras and there are no
calibration procedures required for them," says Orad's technical
director Dr Miky Tamir.

At IBC, Orad showed the use of virtual actors, integrating virtual
characters animated with motion capture in real time, which was
integrated into the virtual set system using the same Onyx CPU that
performs the set rendering.

The company also showed virtual presence, which means a person
recorded in a remote location can be immersed into the virtual set
as a 3D object.

Orad has also developed a feedback mechanism for the talent, which
renders the virtual world from above, calculating the footprint of
all virtual objects in real time and projecting them, tying them in
with the script and projecting them on to the studio floor.

Tracking the Camera

One of the drawbacks of virtual set technology is the high cost of
real time rendered 3-D systems, but the 2-D systems are attracting
some interest, including the BBC-developed DVE at the heart of the
Virtual Scenario system which is sold by Radamec.

Radamec showed the system at IBC with two Scenario units controlled
from a single camera channel, which adds flexibility to the system
enabling both inlays with virtual sets as well as animated graphics
which can interact with the presenter.

Radamec has sold the Scenaria system to ITN and BBC TV Centre. ITN
will be using it for a special project for the General Election,
while BBC TV has begun using the Scenaria on its first mainstream
programme to use a virtual set - Football Focus -  on Saturdays.

The main difference in use of the 2-D system as opposed to 3-D
systems is it cannot handle tracking of the camera, although it
does allow the camera to be panned, tilted, zoomed and focussed on
any virtual background.

The system can also be used as a direct replacement for back
projection and video wall systems. Asia Business News has also
bought a Scenaria system, which will be installed in December with
advanced robotic control and a touch control panel.

There are now other systems on the market which do not need a
supercomputer. FOR-A showed its digiWarp system at IBC, which
combines its own MF 3300 DVE with a video processor it has
developed, called a dimensioning processor which gives 2k x 2k
resolution in the DVE.

This works with the Orad Cyberset video processor to offer a system
using pattern recognition that can offer another two levels of live
images as well as the chroma key signals, and it will handle a
moving camera.

Photron showed its Pseudio virtual studio system, which is based
around the Primatte Pro 100 chromakeying device Photron developed
from technology used by its parent company, the Japanese post
production house Imagica.

Pseudio uses pre-modelling and pre rendering of virtual
backgrounds, which are stored in a disk array. The prerecorded D1
quality images are played back in real time, reflecting the camera
moves fed in by a camera head and tripod system that reads the
information on pan,titl and zoom positions of the foreground image
shot by the video camera.

The Primatte chromakeyer is used to composite foreground and
background images. There are four basic configurations of the
Pseudio system, from a 2D system with single camera configuration
using just a frame buffer, to one with the disk array and versions
using a single camera on rail and dolly, which feeds into two disk
arrays, and a system that combines all the options.  '

NONLINEAR ONLINE REACHES PINNACLE: YOUR GUIDE TO IBC NONLINEAR VIDEO
EDITORS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by David Fox

There are now at least 77 manufacturers offering nonlinear editing
systems, according to Pinnacle's vice president for Europe, Brian
Conner, who claims 74 of them use Pinnacle DVEs within their
packages.

In reality, there are five key nonlinear manufacturers: Avid, D-
Vision, Media 100, Scitex and Lightworks. Quantel's Editbox is also
a serious player, but for high-end use (as is Discreet Logic's
Fire), while most of the traditional edit controller manufacturers
have gone for hybrid (tape and disk) systems, to protect their (and
their customers') investment in existing kit.

It does, however, mean broadcasters have a lot of choice. There is
a system to suit all needs and all price brackets, whether you want
to upgrade in one fell swoop, or merely add nonlinear capabilities
to your existing suites.

With the price of storage dropping so quickly, and its speed
increasing, online nonlinear editing is attainable for all but the
very lowest budgets.

There are still doubts about compatibility of formats and
compression systems, but even here the move towards more open
systems and standard compression formats means that your investment
should be a lot safer.

Scitex claims to offer the broadest range of nonlinear editing
systems on the market (although Avid, Media 100 and D-Vision might
disagree). Every function operates under the "real time, all the
time" banner. The whole Sphere range, launched in PAL at IBC,
offers Dveous effects and mixing technology based on the Abekas
8150 switcher, including keying, wipe generation, and colour
correction.

All effects are key-frameable. The compression rates are better
than 3:1, with variable image resolution, using Apple's Quicktime
file format.

The Sphere line has moved to using Motion JPEG, from the Cube's
wavelet compression.

Avid, which has sold 5,100 editing systems in Europe, showed
version 6.5 of the Media Composer at IBC.

It introduces a new picture resolution (AVR 77) at 2:1 compression.
It also allows live voice over recording, the linking of script to
pictures, eight channel audio, real-time effects, serial digital
i/o and various open system enhancements.

Newscutter's image quality is claimed to have been improved by 60
per cent. It can now also access the AvidNews database, so that
operators can look at scripts or playlists. Other features include:
drag and drop clip management, multiple levels of undo/redo and
title tool templates.

But probably the most impressive debut was MCXpress 1.5 (for Mac
and Windows NT). It is aimed at industrial and corporate use, but
is certainly powerful enough for many broadcast users.

It can create real-time wipes, dissolves and effects at 3:1
compression (the machine can go as low as 2:1) and Pinnacle's
Geniefusion card can be added for real-time 3D effects. It has a
fully integrated film matchback option for negative cut list
generation and the user interface has been simplified.

Vincent and Theo

Media 100 has a new logo and a lot of new, improved editing
products. Its base system, the 100qx, runs under the Adobe Premiere
package. Next up is the new 100le, which delivers real-time video
and audio editing and effects for about 7,500(US$11510).

At the top of the range, the 100xs has been brought in to aim for
high-end production, above the 100 2.6. Gaudi, an optimised version
of Pinnacle's 3D DVE, has also been introduced.

Further developments include the introduction of the Vincent 601
Digital Video Engine and the Theo Superprocessor 'brotherboard',
which it claims make up the first PC-based digital video system
fully compliant with CCIR 601. Features include two video streams
and a real-time alpha channel. They will boost the speed of editing
and effects under Media 100 software.

Media 100 is committed to using Quicktime as its core technology
for all its products for both the Mac and Windows, and is now
working with Apple, Macromedia and Truevision to develop Quicktime
for Windows 95 and NT.

Since Tektronix bought Lightworks, it was expected it would
integrate its disk recorders and Grass Valley effects with the
editing system. Now it has. The Lightworks VIP 4500 is based on the
Profile hard disk recorder and offers four independent video
channels, and Grass Valley DVE technology, for under US$150,000. It
features variable 3:1 compression, 16 channels of audio, between 32
and 96Gb storage (80 to 240 minutes), and Pal/NTSC switchable
software, both of which can be used in 24-frame film mode.

It has a built-in real-time mix/effects board, external device
control, multi-camera editing capability (as on Heavyworks) and can
digitise direct to edit without pre-digitising (as Newsworks).

Newsworks Turbo editing system was also launched at IBC, boasting
Beta SP picture quality at 4:1 compression. It is targeted as a
lower-cost stand-alone replacement for existing tape-based linear
suites and as part of a large-scale automated and networked
newsroom system.

It supports mixed compression rates within the same project or
edit, and can access up to 90Gb in a standard unit, expandable
externally to 180Gb, and eight digital audio channels, also
expandable. It can also control a channel of Profile.

Adcom's Night Suite is a nonlinear D1 and offline editor running
under Windows 95, with up to 2:1 compression, although the dual
channel effects have to be rendered at 4:1 or better. It comes with
a 27Gb drive which gives up to 15 minutes at 2:1 or 2.5 hours at
5:1.

Its audio features are a strong point as an eight channel, 16-bit,
Sadie audio editor is built-in, and its control panel has motorised
faders. Its basic effects include more than 200 wipes, chroma,
alpha and luma keyers.

The Inscriber character generator is included, along with a 2-D DVE
and an optional integrated Aladdin 3-D DVE. The graphical interface
seems nicely designed and clearly laid out and the most used
functions are one button push away on the control panel, as are 24
user definable softkeys.

It has a "soft delete" feature which will remove a shot, or shots,
from playback, but leave them in the timeline, which is useful for
trying different options. It costs about US$58,000, plus options
which include more storage and serial digital i/o.

Waving, Not Drowning

The Philips BTS Newswave has a dedicated control console for high
speed news cutting. Based on Media Pool, it can be uncompressed or
compressed, has a single video channel, and four independent audio
tracks, and a picture-based timeline.

It can be stand alone or networked, with up to 16 workstations
working on the same material at one time, and should be available
next year for about US$20,000 for a server and workstation, plus
Media Pool.

Newswave is cuts only as Media Pool cannot yet handle effects,
although that facility will be added. There is also Wavelite for
loading and logging material, although both applications can run on
the same machine.

Adobe's editing package is Premiere (for the Mac and PC), which can
edit up to 99 video and 99 audio tracks, at a cost of about
400(US$614), for the software only. It is claimed to be highly
customisable, with a wide range of transition effects (wipes,
etc.).

It can also create titles, with crawls and other motion controls
(or import titles from Adobe Illustrator). Its audio effects are
more basic (although still include limited time stretching), but
all the Adobe products benefit from being able to work with plug-in
software modules, which add audio filters or visual effects.
Depending on the hardware it is run on, it can be used as an on-
line editor, or will generate various EDL formats for use off-line.

For more high-end applications, Adobe also has After Effects, a
resolution independent effects package for the Mac, and coming for
Windows NT. Indeed, after years of supporting the Mac platform,
with some products also running on SGI, Adobe has embraced the
Windows PC, thanks to the arrival of Windows NT, which has added
performance and stability to the PC's normal main attraction of low
price.

Quantel's Editbox '96, launched at IBC, is a range of four systems,
costing from about 120,000 (US$184,200), for short or long-form
editing for top-end broadcast and commercials production.
Improvements include faster keying, moves and colour correction.

More editing and paint facilities are built in, and Quantel's Open
Platform Exchange Network (OPEN) is supported, allowing editors
access material on other Quantel systems and from other platforms.
Existing Editboxes, of which more than 250 have been sold, can be
upgraded to Editbox '96.

The New Entrants

Pixel Power's Collage EDit is a non-compressed nonlinear editor
which integrates with existing Collage CG systems (which can be
upgraded for about 45,000, or US$69,100). A complete package,
including CG, costs about 70,000(US$107,450).

Basic storage is 35 minutes, which can be expanded for about
500(US$767) per minute, and compression can be added if users
want. The interface is less graphical than some rivals, but is
reasonably simple.

Clips have to be pre-digitised before editing, but Pixel Power may
bring out a lower cost digitising workstation. The machine was a
crowd-puller at its IBC launch IBC, and picked up eight orders in
the first two days. Deliveries start in December.

ASC's VR NLE is being updated to run under Window's NT. The company
admits its existing DOS version (costing from US$25,000) has not
taken off, partly because of the lack of real-time effects.

The new version, will rectify that and add keying, titling
character generation and Pinnacle Aladdin 3D effects. It will be
based on ASC's VR 300 high quality disk recorder.

As the company has a lot of video servers installed, it will
probably also bring out a news editing system to run on them.  '

MAKING CONTACT WITH INDIA

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The world's second largest (behind China) and least tapped middle
class. India's increasingly affluent middle-income group currently
numbers nearly 250 million people, many of them with at least two
sources of disposable household income, and all looking for a
better quality of life.

The booming economy and the fast pace of development, combined with
a thirst for modernisation and technological expertise, have opened
up India's broadcasting and telecommunications markets as never
before.

Latest estimates show that radio reaches as much as 94 per cent of
the 950 million strong population, the bulk of it living in rural
areas which would be difficult for any other medium to reach.

Television now reaches as much as 84 per cent of the population.
It is axiomatic that, with the kind of headstart that the state-run
terrestrial broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) had, and the effective
monopoly it enjoyed until the start of the 1990s, its national
network and Metro channels (which reach the four metropolitan
centres) should have the maximum reach.

However, Zee TV, which is uplinked via satellite from Hong Kong, is
fast catching up; and there is vigorous competition from a host of
other channels. In comparison with 42 million homes that have DD,
there are 13 million homes today that boast cable and satellite;
and it is this latter segment which is showing signs of growing at
a much faster rate than the former. Official estimates place the
number of cable and satellite homes at 53 million by the year 2005.

TV stations cannot run without adequate software back-up; and
hundreds of companies that offer programming, production and post-
production services have mushroomed in the country over the last
five years, all on the lookout for new technology, both at the
production and post-production stages.

325 Companies Expected

Little wonder, then that some 325 companies are expected to
participate in Broadcast, Cable and Satellite India '96 (BCSI),
India's largest annual broadcast exhibition, which will run
concurrently with Communications India '96 at the Pragati Maidan,
New Delhi, from December 8 to 11.

"We had wonderful response last year for BCSI '95, with our
exhibition and conference providing an ideal forum for the
convergence of broadcasting, cable, satellite, communications and
multimedia packages," enthuses Prem Behl, president of Exhibitions
India, organisers of the event.

"That exhibition, which was the third in the series, paved the way
for several new joint ventures in these sectors, and provided the
ideal opportunity for Indian professionals to discern technological
advancements and gauge the latest market trends.

"The majority of the 121 exhibitors we had were pleased with the
outcome of business at the event, and 62 per cent confirmed their
participation in the following year's event, on the spot!"

Founded in 1987 to promote and organise international trade shows,
exhibitions and conferences, the organisers do much homework before
each event. Adds Behl, "We are not involved in trade, and therefore
have no conflict of interest with our exhibitors.

"In fact, we are a catalyst within the industry that we service,
bringing buyers and sellers together . . . we supplement our
exhibitors in the market by arranging and making it possible for
them to meet qualified, targeted buyers in a cost-effective way."

Catalyst to Contacts

The organisers remain in contact with leading international
associations, standards organisations, legislators, exhibitors,
manufacturers and service organisations worldwide, to facilitate
their participation at forthcoming events.

BCSI '96 is seen as India's official annual broadcast show, since
it is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,
and has the official approval of the India Trade Promotion
Organisation and the ministries of Home Affairs and External
Affairs.

Whereas BCSI '95 ran in October (attracting 121 exhibitors from 14
countries, and 14,203 visitors), and Communications India '95 was
held in December (133 exhibitors from 17 countries, and 16,677
visitors), the two shows have been combined this year to give
exhibitors and visitors the opportunity of witnessing complementary
advances in both fields.

Also running between December 8 and 11 at the same venue will be
Pro-Audio India '96, Lighting India '96, TV India '96, Networks
India '96 and Wireless India '96.

The stalls will be spread over a massive area of 7,000 sq. m on
Pragati Maidan, and are expected to attract 325 exhibitors and more
than 27,000 trade visitors from 30 countries.

In the broadcasting arena, professional camera, lighting, sound,
movie and video production and post-production products, cable and
satellite broadcast systems will all be on display.

Telecommunications product manufacturers will show off both voice
and data communications equipment and value-added services; local,
medium and wide area networks, and mobile systems including
cellular phones and pagers.

"Last year, a little over 50 per cent of the exhibitors were from
overseas," claims Behl. "This year, the ratio of overseas to
domestic exhibitors should be even higher. In addition, we expect
more than 2,000 attendees at the high-profile international
conferences covering all broadcast sectors and communications
technology and practices."

Conference: Digital Focus

The conference will focus on one of the industry's most challenging
issues - the transition to digital technology. It will focus on the
future of cable and telecom networks in India over the next few
years, and the expansion of production and post-production
facilities in the country.

Previous conferences have had delegates from India, the SAARC
countries, Africa, Australia, Europe and the US.

Says Behl, "While each exhibition makes headlines because of its
scope and focus, the conference components are just as important.

"It establishes the environment in which the industry will operate,
from both a technical and regulatory point of view, and defines the
intellectual grounds in which new applications, services or trends
are being utilised."

Visitor Profiles

The visitor profile is expected to include people from senior
levels of central and state governments, and from public and
private sector trade and industry. "We expect a cross-section of
people from all sectors - the government and administration, public
service organisations, the financial sector and management
executives," says Behl.

"In 1995, when we did an analysis of the visitor/buyer attendees,
we found that over 77 per cent visitors were the decision-makers of
their companies, who were involved in purchasing or recommending
the purchase of equipment or services."

Among the confirmed exhibitors at BCSI '96 are Panamsat, Intelsat,
PPC, Scientific Atlanta, General Instruments, Harmonic Lightwaves,
Dielectric Communications and Zenith Electronics (all US); Trans
Electric (Taiwan); Turner International, and Tektronix  (Hong
Kong), Technosat (Dubai); Federation of the Electronics Industry
(U.K), Belden International (Singapore); California Amplifier
(Thailand), EVS Broadcast Equipment (Belgium) and Deviser
Electronics (China).

Some of the prominent exhibitors from the host nation are C-Net
Communications, Prince Electronics, Miraj Marketing, Bhansali
Udyog, Network Limited and Real Image (who will demonstrate the
latest Avid media composer systems, audio-visual systems, airplay
systems, QFX sound effects organisers, media fusion systems,
digidesign session and proloops systems, etc).

"It is the ideal time of year to hold such an important exhibition,
since New Delhi will be cool and pleasant," asserts Behl.

"We are confident that it will be India's biggest show ever."  '

COURTING THE ASIAN BROADCASTER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The Asia-Pacific region now represents a key market for UK
manufacturers looking for untapped areas of growth. But what's in
it for the customers? Simon Croft reports

While the European hifi market is dominated by major Eastern brands
such as Sony and Pioneer, the Asian broadcast market frequently
adopts equipment made in the UK for audio production.

UK-based pro audio manufacturers including SSL and AMS Neve
increasingly regard the Asia-Pacific region as an important and
fertile area for new sales.

The evidence for this can be seen in the growing number of UK
manufacturers providing direct sales and support in Asian
countries.

New Sales Opportunities

The attraction for manufacturers is easy to understand. Major
brands which have achieved a large market share in North America
and Europe find it difficult to perpetually sustain the growth they
once enjoyed in these territories.

By contrast, the Asia Pacific broadcasting sector is undergoing
massive growth and continues to present new sales opportunities.

UK manufacturers can see that broadcasters in the Asia Pacific are
not only buying more equipment: they are also increasingly
demanding state-of-the-art systems to help them achieve a
competitive edge.

But it is by no means a one-sided situation. The UK has a very well
respected pro-audio manufacturing industry and Asian broadcasters
which invest in UK-built products today can be certain that the
solutions they buy into have been refined by a steady stream of
user feedback in the past.

SSL's Experience

Solid State Logic has been notably successful in the region and
recently opened an office in Singapore, which handles sales for a
number of countries as well as technical support for Asian
territories excluding Japan.

The manufacturer has for some years maintained an office in Japan
itself.

In addition, distributors in countries including Korea have been
gaining new contracts. Korean distributor Daiyoung Industrial
recently sold two SSL integrated digital multitrack recording,
editing and mixing systems. Facility Lead Sound opted for an
OmniMix for film and television post production, while HSTV, the
Home Shopping channel chose a Scenaria for its requirements.

Shanghai Radio, A-String in Taiwan and Avon in Hong Kong have all
taken analogue SL9000 series mixing systems. There have also been
recent sales to Synchrosound in Malaysia and Platinum Studios in
Taiwan

Market "Technique-driven"

SSL's Alan MacLeod believes that one of reasons top-end UK
manufacturers are successful in Asia is that the market is
'technique-driven'.

He explains, "When SSL brought out the B series consoles it
effectively enabled new ways of working.

"Hand in hand with the new capabilities of the system came
techniques that were not possible before. There is now global
acceptance of those techniques."

MacLeod also points out that while Asian manufacturers are ideally
geared up to mass production for the consumer market, "more than 90
per cent of the systems we produce are customised in some respect".

According to MacLeod, another factor driving sales of hi-end audio
equipment is a growing awareness that saleable programmes must have
high quality sound tracks.

"Programme makers are selling to broadcasters who may already be
transmitting in surround. As the uptake of domestic decoders
increases, high production values are increasingly essential," he
suggests.

While broadcasters look to overseas sales to maximise profits, and
independent programme-makers constantly seek to attract new buyers,
post-production facilities are constantly looking for a competitive
edge.

Performance: A Crucial Issue

"They want to offer good rates, the ability to meet deadlines
reliably and provide as much creative flexibility as possible,"
MacLeod notes.

He likens the situation to a race track: almost any car would
enable you to complete successive laps but if you want to win,
performance becomes a crucial issue.

KBS - Korea's largest radio and television broadcaster - recently
bought four new mixing consoles from AMS Neve. Two were high-end
Capricorn digital systems, while the other two desks were from the
well established and relatively inexpensive analogue 55 Series.

The KBS satellite television network covers South and North Korea,
Japan and the northern part of China. Two channels offer a range of
programming including sport, drama, documentaries and music.

David Lee of Korean distributor Seoul Sound Technology Group says,
"These sales are very significant for us. KBS is the main
broadcaster in the region and its purchasing decisions will
inevitable influence those of other facilities in Korea."

The two Capricorn consoles, which are being installed this month,
are to be used primarily for live broadcasting and music
production. They are going into KBS' Seoul-based satellite
television station, which was itself only launched in July this
year. Both are 48 fader systems.

The 32 fader 55 series consoles will be delivered in January next
year. They will be installed at KBS' radio station for use in live
music and talk shows.

Earlier this year, Measat Broadcast Services in Malaysia ordered
seven AMS Neve digital consoles for audio post production and
broadcasting.

Phase one of the broadcaster's plan saw the introduction of a 48
channel Capricorn digital desk for light entertainment production.

Also specified were four Logic 3 digital mixers with eight output
Audiofiles, all fitted with removable drives. Two of these were for
dubbing and the two for ADR.

Two Logic 2 digital mixing desks with eight output Audiofile
Spectras with removable drives are being commissioned for live
sound production. One stand-alone eight output Audiofile Spectra is
being used as well. All are fitted with 24-bit systems running
version 12 software.

AMS Neve has also received a repeat order from broadcaster NHK in
Tokyo. Its second large format Logic 2 digital mixing desk is being
used for audio posting in HDTV format programmes.

Like SSL, AMS Neve has a strong foothold in the music recording
sector. Recording studio Asahi Sound in Japan recently ordered its
third AMS Neve V series analogue console. The 60 channel VR Legend
has been installed in Studio 401.

In the case of large-scale consoles suitable for music recording,
the UK has undoubtedly been aided by its historical dominance of
the pop world and the product development that this has financed.

But by no means all UK manufacturers have a connection with the pop
music industry. Audio workstation manufacturer Digital Audio
Research is another UK company enjoying growing success in the
Asia-Pacific.

Towards the end of last year, the manufacturer supplied Malaysian
facilities house Addaudio Post Productions with a Soundstation Gold
integrated system. This gave Addaudio three DAR rooms in total.

At the time, studio manager Daniel Tang noted, "We have been using
DAR Soundstations since 1991 and are very happy with the overall
system approach, particularly in terms of Soundstation's
comprehensive editing facilities and ease of use."

Back For More

Now Addaudio is back for more, as DAR regional sales manager Alan
Campbell explains. "Addaudio have upgraded their two older systems
to Gold specification and have ordered two DAR Sabres this month."

Now a five DAR system facility, AddAudio will be using one of the
mouse-driven Sabres to create a lower cost post room and the other
as an eight track transfer room prior to projects entering one of
the fully equipped dubbing suites.

Elsewhere in Asia, DAR's Japanese distributor has sold systems to
broadcasters including JIC Satellite which opted for a Sabre Plus,
while major broadcasters including TBS have upgraded their existing
systems. Other users include national broadcaster NHK. "We have
done well in most of the major Asian countries, such as Korea,
Taiwan and Malaysia to a degree," says Campbell. "Japan and to a
lesser degree China have been successful for us. We see potential
in Indonesia.

"We are trying to boost the established markets and at the same
time keep up with the emergent markets such as Vietnam and
Cambodia, where they are starting to show real interest."

Working Developing Markets

In terms of developing markets, some products are easier to
introduce than others. Audio Processing Technology is a developer
of compression technologies, a major use for which is in the
distribution of audio via digital ISDN lines.

Although the company's main centres of operation are in the UK and
US, APT sales manager Asia Patrick Cullen is now permanently based
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

"Europe and America are our primary markets but Asia will become
increasingly important over the medium to long term, Cullen
predicts. "The technology we are offering, in terms of ISDN
solutions is still quite new.

"Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan are the more advanced countries but
elsewhere there is less knowledge of ISDN and there is a lot of
groundwork to do.

"In some senses we are having to sell the technology in advance of
the actual products."

Although Cullen estimates that around 95 per cent of broadcasters
in Japan using codecs are using APT technology, in other Asian
countries, there is still not the communications infrastructure to
support the digital technology APT offers.

"We have had our first sales in Taiwan and Korea and we are
involved in quite large projects in Thailand and Malaysia," Cullen
reports. "We are hoping that over the next two to three years we
can replicate the success we have had in Japan.

"It is important to break into new markets because broadcasters
like to know who else is using the equipment. They are reticent
about being the first."  '

MTV ANNOUCES EXPANSION PLANS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

MTV Networks Asia President Peter Jamieson today announced the next
phase in MTV's development in Asia, which are expected to take
place this year.

By the end of October, India will begin receiving its own MTV, a
third service seen only in the Indian subcontinent, while MTV
Mandarin moves its production base to Taipei.

To address MTV's growth in Southeast Asia, staff strength will be
increased with new hires, and all three channels will see the
addition of new programmes that reflect the social, cultural and
musical tastes of each region.

Singapore will remain the regional headquarters for MTV Networks
Asia. All channels will be post-produced and uplinked from
Singapore. The three channels will be referred to as MTV Asia, MTV
India and MTV Mandarin.

Apart from enjoying a new service specifically for them, Indian
viewers can look forward to new shows that will be produced in
India and Singapore, as well as a higher rotation of Indian music
videos, interviews and new features.

MTV India will be delivered to the Indian subcontinent on Panamsat
4, which up till the end of October delivers the MTV Asia feed
containing four hours of India-specific programming.

MTV Mandarin will move its production base from Singapore to
Taipei. The move beefs up the Taipei office with hiring new local
staff, and several of the channel's staff from Singapore, including
on-air personalities, will also be relocated to Taipei. The channel
will announce a roster of new shows in due course.

MTV Asia forges ahead with new programmes designed from Southeast
Asia, including new shows specific to Asean countries, plus
increased rotation of music videos from the region.

Recently, MTV Asia launched a new live music series called Live &
Loud, showcasing some of the best in upcoming Asian artists.

DOORDARSHAN TIGHTENS GRIP ON NDTV AND TV TODAY

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Doordarshan (DD) has issued notices to the owners of TV Today (part
of the India Today group) and New Delhi Television (NDTV),
informing them both that their current affairs programmes - Aaj Tak
(Until tonight) and News Tonight -  would not be televised on the
national network at prime time any longer.

Sources in the ministry for Information and Broadcasting (I&B) say
that, in all probability, News Tonight would be dropped altogether,
since the firm has entered into a tie-up with the Hong Kong based
Star TV network owned by Rupert Murdoch, to make similar
programmes.

The new schedule, which comes into effect on any day between
November 4 and 6, places both the current affairs programmes half
an hour later than their current slots. DD has also quadrupled the
telecast fees for both programmes, asking for payment much higher
than is being charged for tele-serials.

Both the private producers used to pay a fee of Rs35,000
(US$1,000), but this has now been increased sharply to Rs150,000
(US$4,225). And even this fee will suffer a review after six
months.

HP SERVER OFFERS MOST CHANNELS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Hewlett-Packard recently announced its support for clustered
networking of its broadcast servers, allowing up to 24 on-air
channels, the largest number of channels available in the broadcast
industry to date.

With the HP MediaStream Server - Broadcast Series as the core
building block, broadcasters can create truly scaleable systems -
from two to 24 channels - opening up new application areas for
digital server technology.

The HP MediaStream Server - Broadcast Series is the low-cost
building block of a multichannel system. It provides advanced
server capabilities - networking, a proven "bulletproof"
architecture, industry-standard MPEG-2 video compression and an
open platform for applications development - at prices starting at
US$100,000.

Because a single HP broadcast server offers up to six channels, it
is the ideal starting point for a multi-channel system.

With standard features such as RAID (redundant array of inexpensive
disks), redundant components and a multi-threaded operating system,
the HP clustered-server complex can offer complete redundancy
without the total mirroring of servers of the server complex
itself.

HP's use of MPEG compression also adds to the cost-effectiveness of
this multichannel solution. Because MPEG uses one-third less disk
space than Motion JPEG, storage costs are dramatically reduced.

This cost can be significant when considering the massive storage
needs of a multichannel facility or of a pay-per-view or NVOD
system. A key component of server clusters is the underlying
network used to connect multiple servers into a server complex.

HP has incorporated Fibre Channel networking into its servers for a
broadcast-studio environment. Fibre Channel is a very-high-speed
link capable of faster-than-real-time transfers.

It can be implemented in cost-effective "loop" configurations that
do not require the use of an expensive network switch.

MANILA'S PASI BUYS RUSSIAN SATELLITE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Philippine Agila Satellite, a government-backed consortium,
recently bought for US$9.5 million the country's first commercial
satellite from Russian space agency Intersputnik.

The satellite, Agila 1, is due to be operational by Nov 10, in time
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting, which is
being hosted by the Philippines.

The purchase of the Russian satellite is an interim measure,
pending completion in early 1998 of two other broadcast and
telecoms satellites, being built by Aerospatiale of France.

PASI's interim satellite has already been in orbit for three years
and the company has effectively bough the last two years of its
operational life, Mr Panizales said.

PASI was hard-pressed to come up with a satellite
telecommunications service for the APEC ministers meeting, which
starts Nov 24.

HUM AAPKE HAIN KAUN IN MASSIVE FESTIVE DEAL WITH STAR TV

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The Hindi feature film, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? (What is my
relationship with you?) is to be shown on November 10, the main day
of the Hindu festival Deepavali, on Star TV.

The premiere on the small screen will net the movie's producers,
the Barjatya family of Rajshree Films, a record Rs50 million
(US$1.4 million).

The film, which is basically a family entertainer, holds the record
for the highest box-office collections, having grossed more than
Rs2.25 billion (US$64 million) during the three years that it has
run at various cinema houses in the country.

It stars current matinee idol Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan in what
reviewers call a 'squeaky-clean' film. It is understood that Star
TV has forked over is Rs10 million, more than what Godrej Soaps had
to pay for sponsoring the Miss World beauty pageant in Bangalore in
November.

The deal, considered a major coup in the Hindi film industry, will
eclipse the trend set by another great Indian film Sholay (Embers),
which was recently screened by Doordarshan on a national holiday.

The screening, done through G. P Sippy Films, helped DD to pocket
around Rs25 million in ad revenues through the selling of 83 time
slots to various advertisers.

OVERWHELMING DEMAND REPORTED FOR ASTRO SERVICE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Most of Astro's first batch of 7,000 Digital Satellite Receivers
(DSRs) have been sold even before they reached the authorised
Philips dealers.

According to Paul Edwards, Astro's Chief Operating Officer, the
demand prior to the soft launch of Malaysia's new digital satellite
television and radio station on October 1, was overwhelming.

"We took nearly 3,000 calls last Thursday alone from interested
subscribers, and this is even before our advertising campaign
starts on October 12," he said.

The first subscribers are expected to have their sets installed
starting next week. Edwards said Astro will not be charging
subscribers during the month of October.

"October is a settling in period, and there will be some tuning of
the service. More shipments of the DSRs are on the way, but we
advise potential subscribers to reserve their DSRs now," he added.

Astro's Director of Information Systems, Andrew Lee, reported some
11,000 "hits" per day on the Astro Internet website. These included
both Malaysian and international users. The website can be accessed
at http:// www.astro.com.my.

"If there is any indication of interest, Astro has certainly caught
the imagination of the Malaysian public," said Lee.

ESPN PLAYS BALL WITH STAR SPORTS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Sports satellite channel giants and arch-rivals ESPN and Star
Sports have turned into somewhat uncomfortable bed-fellows, in an
effort to trim losses and beat the enormous pressure created by
intense competition and lack of sufficient revenues in the Asian
market.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two rival
channels, which was signed in early-October, clarifies that the
tie-up is only for Asia. It envisages the setting up of a new joint
venture company by ESPN and Star, to be headed by Sandy Brown of
ESPN.

The Delhi-based Modi Entertainment Network (MEN), which manages the
programming for ESPN, will continue in the same capacity for the
new network. MEN has a three-year contract with ESPN, of which just
one year has elapsed.

The main reason for the synergies between the two groups is that
the bidding route for sports programmes had become so high that
even advertising revenues have failed to cover the costs.

By joining hands, the two groups can try and ensure that the
programmes on the sale block remain between them, and that the
bidding price is not pushed too high.

In another related development, Star TV announced the joining of
former Doordarshan director-general R. Basu as managing director of
its India operations. Basu will head News Television International,
Murdoch's holding company in India.

NEW MALAYSIAN BROADCASTING BILL TABLED

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

MALAYSIAN Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat recently tabled
a Bill calling for a jail term of up to three years for anyone
failing to obtain a licence for receiving foreign broadcasts.

He said that the change to the current provisions were necessary to
keep ahead with technology.

"These changes should not be left to occur with no specific
direction, but be directed towards the benefit of the people and
the country," he said when tabling the Bill to amend the
Broadcasting Act 1988 in the Lower House of Parliament.

He added that the amendments will enable the licencing and control
of new broadcasting services, following advances in satellite
technology.

Under the amended act, a licence will be required from the
Information Ministry in order to receive any foreign broadcast or
telecast directly, and to make any transmission from Malaysia.

Offenders could face a fine of up to M$100,000 (US$39,280), or a
jail term of up to three years, or both.

Under the bill, the Information Minister will have the right to
determine the size and form of transmission receivers, control the
type and supply of broadcast materials to places such as hotels,
and to give exemptions for such licences in the broadcast of
official functions or other non-profit oriented public services.

The bill also states that prior approval will be needed from the
Information Minister before the screening of any advertisement, and
failure to do so will constitute an offence. Those convicted could
be fined up to M$10,000 (US$3930), jailed for a year, or both.

The Bill also incorporates additional areas such as ships and
aircraft, which were previously outside the ambit of the
Broadcasting Act's provisions.

The Minister added that that Malaysians could now watch programmes
from private TV stations and that subscribed television services
had been introduced last November.

He added that the launch (last January) of Measat 1, Malaysia's
first satellite, was a milestone in the development of broadcasting
and telecoms technology in the country.

"With wise management, satellite TV can help us in our effort to
create an informed society," he said.

Nonetheless, the government has the responsibility to ensure that
the technology will not be misused to jeopardise the national
interest socially, economically or politically, he continued.

The amendments will place the administration and licensing of radio
and television receivers under the direct supervision of the
Information Ministry.

In another report, the Minister for Energy, Telecoms and Posts,
Datuk Leo Moggie was quoted as saying that the development of the
multi-media super corridor and the growth in the number of
television users in the country would help boost the market for
satellite related service, and that Malaysia has surpassed the
average television and personal computers penetration levels for
developing countries.

He said that the telecommunications market in the Asia-Pacific
region had experienced tremendous growth over the past 15 years,
and that the demand for satellite capacity was expected to grow
from some 850 transponders in 1993 to about 1,300 in 1997, and to
more than 2,100 transponders eventually by the year 2000.

MALAYSIAN BROADCASTING: WATCH THIS SPACE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Malaysia certainly looks set to position itself to attract the
major broadcasting companies in its bid to become the region's
broadcasting hub, if the events over the last few months are any
indication.

The evidence is overwhelming: the recent launch of the country's
first national satellite television and radio project, Measat
Broadcast Networks Systems; an initial investment of an estimated
US$2 to $10 billion to realise plans to create a multimedia super
corridor via a new hi-tech city close to Putrajaya, the new
administrative capital; fresh incentives for foreign broadcast
companies to start up in the country, such as preferential
treatment for infrastructural contracts and corporate tax
exemptions; a proposed Bill of Guarantees to regulate intellectual
property legislation to protect investor interests; new amendments
to the Broadcasting Act to legalize parabolic dishes, antennae
decoders and radars; a third Measat satellite by the end of the
decade, amongst many other projects and plans all clearly signal
the country's intent to lead the region in broadcasting and
communications.

The signals say: "yes, we're serious and we want to lead. And don't
take our word for it. Our efforts will speak for themselves." Such
vigour is optimistic, refreshing, and will be exciting to watch.
