ACTIVITIES AT MEGAWATI"S PDI HQ SUSPENDED 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Activities at Megawati
Sukarnoputri's new party headquarters in East Jakarta were suspended
at 11:20 a.m. Friday.

    A statement posted at the headquarters' gate said activities
will remain suspended until the party obtains permission to use the
office from the mayor of East Jakarta.

    The statement, signed by Tarto Sudiro, an executive of
Megawati's faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), also
said that matters regarding the new headquarters are being handled
by their lawyers.

    Megawati, who was ousted as PDI chairman in a congress in Medan,
North Sumatra, last June, has set up the East Jakarta headquarters
barely two weeks ago.

    Her faction occupied the party headquarters in Central Jakarta
before supporters of the rival faction, led by newly installed PDI
chairman Soerjadi, took over on July 27.

    The violent takeover sparked riots which according to the
National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) left  five dead and
more than a hundred injured.

    On Monday, the mayor of East Jakarta, Lt Col Sudarsono, ordered
Megawati to close down the headquarters by Thursday afternoon,
citing complaints from the local community that it was set up in a
residential area.

    However, Sudarsono on Thursday extended the deadline by 24
hours.

    One of Megawati's lawyers, Pontas Nainggolan, has said that they
were meeting officials of the mayor's office Thursday afternoon to
discuss the deadline's extension.

PRESIDENT ASKS PPP TO GROOM ITS CADRES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto said on Friday
that the United Development Party (PPP) should concentrate in
consolidating its position by grooming party cadres to address
future challenges.

    Future challenges require the party to groom its cadres, PPP
chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum quoted the head of state as saying.

    Ismail met the president to discuss among others matters related
to the 1997 general elections.

    The president has once asked the National Defence and Security
Council (Wanhankamnas) to draft procedures for organising political
campaigns to ensure that they do not cause any negative impact.

    He also reminded the three political parties --the PPP, the
ruling Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)-- not to use
the campaigns as a "show of force" as this could only lead to
clashes.

    The political parties will contest 425 seats in the 500-seat
Parliament next year.  The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the
Armed Forces (ABRI), whose members do not vote for any of the three
parties.

    Metareum said his party agrees to the holding of dialogue-based
campaigns without leaving out mass-based campaigns.

    The PPP chairman also said that 60 percent of their candidates
for parliament are neophytes.

    Earlier, the president also received ulemas from Jakarta and its
environs grouped in the Ulemas Forum.

    The president expressed gratitude to the ulemas for their
support for his leadership.

    "I only want to devote my life in the interests of the nation
and the state.  May Allah allow this," he said.

    He also reiterated that differences in opinion in a democratic
society are natural and that these differences should be solved
through deliberations to reach an agreement.

    "Go ahead with your arguments at the forum," he said.

INDONESIA"S PUBLIC HEALTH RATES LOWEST AMONG ASEAN COUNTRIES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sep 27 (ANTARA)-  Health Minister Sujudi  admitted
Friday that public health conditions in Indonesia rate the lowest
among ASEAN member countries.

    The fact should spur the country's medical community to do their
utmost to improve  public health services, he said.

    "The Health Ministry has been striving to improve the conditions
of public health by providing  relevant infrastructure facilities,
medical equipment and
improving health conditions all over the country," said Sujudi after
installing nine senior ministry officials in  new posts.

    He said the country was still facing various challenges in the
health sector, among other things, the task of raising the
life-expectancy of Indonesians from 62.7 years in the Fifth
Five-Year Development Plan to 73 years at  the end of the second
long-term development cycle.

    The government was also encouraging efforts to lower
the infant mortality rate from 58 per one thousand of born babies to
only 25 per one thousand  and the  maternity death rate from 390 per
100,000 deliveries  to only 200, he said.

    Indonesia's present life-expectancy of 62.7 years was also still
the lowest among ASEAN countries such as the Philippines (66.5),
Thailand (71.3), Malaysia (72.6), Brunei (76) and Singapore (77.1),
he noted

    The country's current maternity death  rate of 390 per 100,000
deliveries  was still high compared with the Philippines (250),
Thailand (180), Malaysia (120), Brunei (15) and Singapore (14), the
minister further said.

    Sujudi said that malaria, diarhea, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS
were among the diseases requiring particular attention to improve
the health conditions of mothers and their babies.

    "But the most important thing is making  all the people
understand that the improvement of public health is the
responsibility of all," he said.

OPERATIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL FIHSING TO BE INCREASED 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesian Armed Forces Commander
General Feisal Tanjung said here on Friday operations to fight
illegal fishing in the country's waters will be increased.

    He said the operations would be stepped up even though the armed
forces had no plan to acquire more ships.

    Tanjung said the endurance, expertise and equipment of the
country's fishermen had to be improved so that they could fish up to
the Exclusive Economic Zone.

    He said the armed forces would take stern actions against any
poacher or individual suspected of protecting illegal fishing.

TELKOM CONCLUDES CONTRACT WITH LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR EQUIPMENT SUPPLY 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Bandung, Sept 27 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia's state-owned
international telecommunications operator PT Telkom announed in New
York Friday it concluded a contract worth 22.7 million dollars with
Lucent Technologies for expanding the firm's data communication
network and services for business customers.

     Telkom's public relations chief T Hedi Safina said the state
company also announced details of phase II covering its strategic
partnership with Lucent Technologies to assist the entire plan of
building the world class telecommunications network in Indonesia by
year 2000.

     He said Telkom also announced a data network expansion and plan
for 1997 covering a unique partnership in the form of knowledge
transfer with Lucent Technologies during its financial roadshow by
Telkom's president to New York, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, London
and Boston, for the dissemination of information on the latest
development of Telkom to the international financial community.

     Indonesia with a telephone density rate of about 1.4 for every
100 people, planned to expand the existing telephone network by the
installation of at least another five million lines during the
implementation of its telecommunication development program in the
current Sixth National Development ending in 1999.

     Telkom's president AA Nasution said the telecommunications
industry in Indonesia has been growing very rapidly.

     Therefore, in view of the development and continuation of
deregulations in Indonesia's telecommunications industry and the
mounting competition, one of the most important things Telkom should
do was to promote the management of networks and capacity of the
subscriberes, he said.

     The knowledge transfer program is a combination between formal
training in the classroom, practice and the facilities of Lucent
Technologies and AT & T in the United States, with the support of
training in Indonesia.

     The experts of Lucent Technologies and AT&T will cooperate with
the management and staff of Telkom in sharing knowledge and
experience.

     Meanwhile, vice president of International Services of Lucent
Technologies Greg Hughes said Telkom wished to achieve a world class
operational standard to support the development of its networks.

     The knowledge transfer program was already started in April
1996, and by the end of this year the management and staff of Telkom
will finalize several parts of the program, Hedi Safina said.

INDONESIA"S FRUIT IMPORTS THREE TIMES ITS FRUIT EXPORTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bogor, W Java, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesia imports an average
of 112,000 tons of fruits worth US$7.83 million every year or three
times the value of its fruit exports which totals only US$2.6
million a year, an expert said.

    The wide discrepancy between imports and exports should  prompt
the country to spur and step up  horticultural production, Rector of
the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) Prof Dr Soleh Solahuddin
said here Friday.

    The rector made the remarks at the signing of a cooperation
agreement between IPB and PT Mekar Unggul Sari, the company running
the Mekar Sari national horticultural garden at Cileungsi, West
Java.

    According to Solahuddin, the cooperation was also expected to
improve the national agricultural image in  global trade.

    "The declining national agricultural image must be elevated
through  modern agricultural development," he added.

    Solahuddin also pointed out that despite its richness in fruits,
Indonesia was lagging behind other countries in  fruit cultivation
due among other things to its limited capability to produce superior
seeds.

    Meanwhile, President Director of PT Mekar Unggul Sari Siti
Hutami on the occasion expressed the hope that the cooperation could
improve the quality of local fruits so that they could compete with
those produced by other countries.

EMBASSY SUPPORTS IDEA TO FORM FORMER U.S. VISITORS FORUM 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Medan, N Sumatra, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta
supports a proposal to use the U.S. International Visitors Program
(IVP) in Medan as a forum for Indonesian young professionals who
once visited the U.S., a U.S. diplomat said.

    The idea of forming an association of Indonesian young
professionals who once visited the U.S. was very good because it
would re-open contacts among the IVP participants in the region or
between them and members of the U.S. community they used to know,
Second Secretary at the U.S. Embassy Shawn Dorman said here Friday.

    Dorman was here along with U.S. State Department  official for
Indonesian affairs Lucy Abbott for a meeting  with a number of
former Indonesian visitors to the U.S. at the building of the
Indonesia-America Friendship Association (PPIA).

    IVP is a program for the exchange of professionals, which is
managed by the education and cultural affairs agency of the U.S.
Information Center. It invites members of the international
community to come the U.S. every year.

    On the occasion, Dorman also promised to deliver the hope of
Executive Director of PPIA's Medan chapter Jasamin Saragih to
relevant U.S. officials in Jakarta who were expected to attend the
inaugurating ceremony of IVP in Medan in the near future.

    In 1995, the U.S. government invited at least 16 Indonesians
with different educational and professional backgrounds, including
journalists and intellectuals to make a month-long tour of the U.S.

    According to reports from an association of international
visitors to Los Angeles (IVCLA), the 16 Indonesians were among 1000
IVP participants from across the world.

    The IVP participants every year had the opportunity to visit Los
Angeles during their tour of America, IVCLA's honorary chairman
Richard J Riordan said.

    Riordan pointed out that the 16 Indonesians along with other IVP
participants from 140 countries in the U.S. were expected to know
more about the life of U.S. urban people and U.S. urban
environmental innovation programs.

    IVCLA's executive director Janet Elliot said her side expected
that the IVP participants would maintain the good relations of
friendship with the American people they had become acquainted with.

    During their stay in the U.S., the Indonesian IVP participants
discussed various matters with U.S. officials, non-government
organizations and members of local communities.

INDONESIA"S CONSTRUCTION SECTOR TO FACE CHALLENGES ON GLOBAL MART 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Yogyakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesia's construction sector
will  face special challenges in the structural and engineering
aspects on the global market, a researcher said.

    Foreign investment in the construction sector in the country has
also been increasing since the construction industry was opened to
foreign investors in 1992, lecturer and researcher at the Technical
Faculty of the Atma Jaya University in Yogyakarta Peter F Kaming, M
Eng., Ph.D said on Friday.

    Kaming made the remarks in his speech on Indonesia's  human
resource development in the face of construction industry challenges
on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of Atma Jaya University.

    According to Kaming, foreign investors in the construction
sector entered Indonesia due among other things to the presence of
their partners in other sectors, who needed building facilities like
warehouses and factories.

    He further said Indonesia should follow other ASEAN member

countries like Singapore which had no natural resources but  were
aware of the importance of  human resources development in their
economic development.

    He therefore hoped  that Indonesia could take further advantage
of the cooperation with other ASEAN members in  the interest of
national economic development.

    He also pointed out that in macro terms , AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade
Area) would give mutual advantages to its  member countries but in
micro terms , it would be an arena of competition among them.

    Kaming likewise hoped Indonesia would not become an object in
the "zero game" because it would then only be a loser.

PNG AGREES TO SETTING UP OF BORDER CHECKPOINTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Manokwari, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Papua New Guinea (PNG) has agreed
to an Indonesian proposal for either side to set up a checkpoint for
traffic across their common border, according to an Indonesian
official who attended recent Indonesia-PNG border talks.

    The border talks took place aboard a ship, the Ciermai, last
Tuesday,  Indonesia's border liaison official FX Suryanto Sriwardoyo
told ANTARA Friday.

    He said  the two checkpoints would be set up at spots on the
border between Indonesia's Jayapura district  and PNG's province of
Sandau.

    He said Indonesia would build the checkpoint in its region while
the other one in PNG would be built by the PNG government.

    He said it was hoped by the two governments that the two
checkpoints would facilitate across-the-border visits by their
citizens and trade between their peoples.

    During the meeting, Indonesia also asked the PNG to immediately
realize its plan to build a road between Vanimo  and Sandaun.

    Suryanto said Indonesia had already built a 75- kilometer road
from Jayapura to the border.

    Indonesia was expecting the PNG to finish a remaining stretch of
1.5 kilometers of road from Wutung that would l connect the two
countries, he said.

    Regarding the question of around 3,000 Irian Jayan border
crossers in PNG's Is Awin detention camp, Suryanto said their return
would depend on the PNG government.

    Last year it was the UNHCR that handled their return but now
after the UN body had closed its office in PNG, the repatriation was
not running smoothly.

    The Indonesian government in Irian Jaya had already declared its
preparedness to receive the repatriates any time, he said.
     According to Suryanto, the  UNHCR had closed its representative
office in PNG because the cases it dealt with so far were mere

border crosser problems.

    Regarding the extradition or deportation of Irian Jaya security
distrubing gang (GPK) members who are still in PNG, Suryanto said
that the issue would be discussed by the Indonesian ministry of
justice with its PNG counterpart.

GOVT CONTROL STILL NEEDED IN FOOD, BEVERAGE TRADE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sep 27 (ANTARA)- The food and beverage trade in

Indonesia still needs a measure of governmental control to ensure
smooth and even distribution,  a trade  spokesman said here on
Friday.

    Thomas Darmawan, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Food
and Beverage Traders (GAPMI), said  governmental  intervention was
still needed to overcome  difficulties food and beverage businessmen
were encountering in the marketing of their products all over the
country.

    He also said certain agricultural products should be subject to
a government-controlled collection and distribution system to ensure
their continuous availability and their prices' stability.

    Citing rice as an example, Darmawan said  governmental control
on trade in this commodity was necessary to guarantee sufficient
supply and proper distribution.

    Keeping food available to people throughout the country at
affordable prices was in the interest of the success of national
development , he said.
      According to Darmawan, the application of governmental
controls to the food and beverage trade was common in foreign
countries such as Australia and some  European countries.

    "In  Australia there is an Apple Board and farmers' associations
for other products," said Darmawan who is also chairman of the
Indonesian Communication Forum on Food.

    The main function of farmers' associations was to maintain
balance between supply and demand so that farmers would always have
reasonable selling prices, he said.

    Indonesian food producers should learn a good lesson from the
implementation of trading schemes in other countries, he said.

organized by an Indonesian exhibition company PT Indo Asean Persada
(IAP) and its Chinese partner, Sinochem.

    "We have been requested by the Chinese government to continue

told newsmen here on Friday.

    The Indonesian Opportunities '96 was officially opened here on
Thursday by Djermani Sandjaja, a senior official of the Office of
the Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution, in the

IPTN and PT Citra Lamtoro Gung.

    In addition to the exhibition, the participants will also have
the opportunities to hold business contacts with their Chinese
counterparts, said Moeffreni.

    He further said that the Indonesian Opportunities '96 is the
realization of the willingness of Indonesian business circles to
promote their products in the Chinese market.

    Following the opening of the exhibition on Thursday, three
memorandums of understanding (MOU's) have been signed by Indonesian
and Chinese businessmen.

    PT Citra Lamtoro Gung and Zhanjiang Expressway Corp. on Thursday

Corp, also signed an MOU for the development of rubber-dam and
mini-hydro generating plants in Indonesia's rural areas.

    Another Indonesian company, PT Sucofindo and its Chinese
counterpart also signed an MOU to establish cooperation in control
and monitoring of export goods.

    Data from the Indonesian embassy show that trade balance between
Indonesia and China from January to July this year reached a total
of US$1.86 billion in favour of Indonesia.

    During that period, Indonesia exported various non-oil/gas

MILY COMMANDER: IRIAN JAA GPK LEADER KILLS FOUR HOSTAGES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jayapura, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Major General Johny Lumintan, the
VIIIth (Trikora) Military Regional commander, has accused Thadius
Yogi, leader of the Irian Jaya touble maker group (GPK Irja) of
killing four people who had been held hostage.

    Maj Gen Lumintang has blamed Yogi for the four deaths in two
separate recent hostage cases in the province.

    The four hostages killed by the GPK leader were Navy Panekenan
and Matheus Lasamahu in Mapnduma, and Tumaji and Maksum, workers of
logging company PT Kamundan Raya.

    In January the GPK Irja took 26 people, including seven
Europeans, hostage in central Irian Jaya.

    They released one foreigner and 14 of the Indonesian hostages.
The remainder escaped in May following a rescue operation launched
by units of the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI), during which two
Indonesian hostages were killed.

    An armed group kidnapped 16 workers of a logging company, also
in central Irian Jaya, on August 14.

    Fourteen of the hostages were either released or escaped their
captors but two of the hostages were found dead in the jungle on
September 16 with ABRI saying their bodies had wounds indicating
torture and slaughter.

    Troops clashed with the armed group last month, during which one
of the captors, identified as Pius Orok Yane Magai Yogi, was shot
dead. The ABRI claimed then that the dead Yogi was the leader of the
group.

    Lumintang said that Yogi was responsible for the four deaths,
although in the first hostage case, the military have said that the
GPK kidnappers were headed by a man identified as Kelly Kwalik.

    He did not elaborate but said that the ABRI units would continue
to hunt down GPK members in Irian Jaya.

    Central Irian Jaya, the site of the hostage dramas, is covered
by mountainous jungles and experiences heavy rainfall and
temperatures as low as ten degrees Celcius.

EAST JAKARTA MAYOR SEALS MEGAWATI"S PARTY HQ 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - The East Jakarta Municipality
authorities here on Friday afternoon sealed the new headquarters of
ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati
Sukarnoputri at Jalan Raya Tengah No. 1, Condet, Pasar Rebo in East
Jakarta.

    Tens of officials, accompanied by stick-wielding policemen, put
notices on the front gate and door of the building, declaring the
premises sealed by the order of the Mayor of East Jakarta,
Sudarsono.

    "It is now closed down and there should be no activities here
pending negotiations between city authorities and (the Megawati)
side," said Rajak Gogi, the head of East Jakarta's law and order
department, who led the team that closed the building.

    The notices said that the closure was based on a law forbiding
offices in residential areas, and warned of legal action against
anyone attempting to break the seal.

    Sudarsono earlier this week sent a letter to Megawati ordering
her to "immediately close down" the new party headquarters, saying
it breaches a government decree against using "residential homes as
offices for business purposes."

    Megawati, the daughter of the late President Sukarno, opened the
office Sept 9 in the East Jakarta suburb of Pasar Rebo, to replace
the party's main headquarters in downtown Jakarta after it was
seized on July 27. The seizure triggered widespread riots, the worst
in 22 years.

    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, an official of the Megawati faction,
said that the party executives will continue with their task.

    Another Megawati ally, Mangara Siahaan, said they already had an
alternative headquarters but declined to give further details.

FOREIGN NURSING ACADEMIES STILL NOT ALLOWED IN INDONESIA 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Banjarmasin, S Kalimantan, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Foreigners are
still not allowed to establish paramedic academies in the country so
that existing paramedics need for the time being not worry about
foreign competition, a government health official said.

    But Dr Hadisantoso, head of the Health Ministry's Paramedic
Education Center, also said by year 2003 the situation would be
different and Indonesian paramedics should therefore use the interim
period to improve their professional capabilities.

    Hadisantoso was speaking at a workshop organized by
Muhammadiyah Nursing Academy here.

    He said  foreigners would be allowed to set up nursing academies
in Indonesia only after year 2003 when the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) would begin. The country's doors to free trade would be
further opened in 2010 for other countries in Asia and the Pacific
and in 2010 to all other countries in the world, he said.
     In view of the foreign competition due to be encountered in the
not so distant future, all health educational institutions in the
country should create more medical attendants of good quality from
now,  he added.

    According to Hadisantoso, the Health Ministry had also made
efforts to improve the quality of paramedics in the country through
among other things the holding of courses and workshops.

AIR FORCE CHIEF: PURCHASE OF F-16S STILL INDECISIVE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Solo, C Java, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Air Force Chief of Staff Vice
Marshal Sutria Tubagus said the United States government has not
decided whether or not to sell nine of its F-16s to Indonesia,
because the US Congress was still discussing the matter.

    "However, whatever their decision on the sale of the F-16s,

which costs nine million US dollars per plane, it would be no
problem for Indonesia, because Indonesia still have a choice for
other equally powerful aircraft," he said when installing young air
force officers in Solo Saturday.

    Indonesia chose these fourth generation F-16s because of their
technology, he said.

    Indonesia, he added, became more confident in  the F-16s because
some other Asean member countries were also using these aircraft and
appeared to be satisfied with their potentials.  And in case repair
was needed, Indonesia would always be able to ask for assistance
from the other Asean member countries, he said.

    If the government has the money and the purchase of the F-16s
has to be cancelled, Indonesia could always turn to the French
Mirage-2000s jet fighters, he said.

    In the meantime, he added, Indonesia has purchased Adhock 100
and 200 aircraft, which will undergo a trial flight on the occasion
of the 51st anniversary of the Indonesian Armed Forces on October
25.

    The new jet fighters were to replace aging aircraft.  Indonesia
has now two squadrons of Adhock 100 and 200 jet planes and one
squadron of F-16s.

    The purchase of these aircraft was actually under the third
five-year program, while the first five-year program covered the
preparation of all the aircraft of the air force, and the second
five-year program was aimed at increasing the potential of the
existing squadrons according to standard, and in the next five years
new planes would be purchased.

    The newly-installed air force officers, he said, were expected
to become reliable personnel in facing the rapid progress of the
time.

BATAM AUTHORITY ISSUES RULINGS ON HOUSE OWNERSHIP FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Batam, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Research and Technology Minister as
Chairman of the Batam Authority BJ Habibie  has signed a decision on
house ownership for foreign nationals on Batam Island.

    "I have just signed the decision and it goes into effect as of
now," Habibie, who is also head of the Agency for Assessment and
Application of Technology, said in Nongsa Point Marina, Batam,
Saturday.

    The occasion was also attended  by Indonesian Ambassador to
Singapore HBL Mantiri, Tourism Director General Andi Mappisameng,
and business tycoon Ciputra as well as a number of Singapore
businessmen.

    Habibie said foreign nationals, wherever they came from, Asia or

Europe, were allowed to own a home of their own on Batam Island,
providing they worked in Batam according to the regulations, in
possession of a smart card, and were members of a golf club in the
area.

    The property they may own were houses in resort areas,
condominiums, luxury houses in real estates each worth at least Rp
200 million with a 70-year lease.

    Habibie said the decision was not a solution to the gloom in the
property sector on Batam Island, but a follow up of Government
Regulation Number 41 of 1996 on the right of foreigners to own a
house in Indonesia.

    Developers on Batam island would become encouraged and enjoy the
fruits of the regulation.

    Meanwhile, First Assistant to the Batam Authority Chief Gunawan
Hadisoesilo said on a separate occasion that the decision was
applicable on Batam Island only, and the foreign nationals wishing
to have such property did not necessarily have to be actually
staying in Indonesia.

    By owning a house in Batam, he added, a foreigner would come to
Batam much more often, which may encourage growth of other sectors,
while the government would receive one percent of the sale of each
house.

    Habibie also said the Batam Authority would go on with its plan
to build infrastructure projects, including the Asia Port in Kabil.

    Besides YTL from Malaysia, Indoport from the United Kingdom
signed a contract on the building of a US$ 900 million container
terminal in Kabil on the basis of the BOT (build, operate and
transfer) basis for 60 years.

    The British investor will build the terminal in stages with a
capacity for 2.5 million TEUS from 1997 to 1999, and with an
increase of 1.8 million TEUS in 2000.  Along with YTL, the terminal
would have a capacity for 15.4 million TEUS by the year 2000s.

    Habibie said Asia Port has bright prospects, because
containerized goods for export would continue to increase sharply,
not to mention containers coming from other countries.

GOVT TARGETS READYING OF 20,000 HA OF PEATLAND IN 1996/97 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bogor, West Java, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - The government has targeted
the preparation of  20,000  hectares of peatland in Central
Kalimantan for rice farming in the 1996/1997 budget year, Public
Works Minister Radinal Moochtar said here Saturday.

    The 20,000 hectares would be part of the government's
one-million-hectare peatland conversion project in Central
Kalimantan province, the minister said.

    Speaking to reporters  after attending  a seminar organised by

the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) here over the weekend,
Moochtar said since work was begun on the project last February,
2,000 hectares of the peatland had been cleared for rice planting.
     He said  to meet the 20,000-hectare target in 1996/1997, an
average of 70 hectares of the peatland per day had to be cleared,
adding that the work required much manpower and heavy-duty
equipment.
     The minister said the project also included the building of an
irrigation system.  So far, 175 km of secondary and 500 km of
primary irrigation canals had been  created.

    The minister also said removing logs and roots from  the
peatland  was one of the most difficult parts of the clearing work.

    "We want the farmers who will grow the rice to receive the land
in ready-to-use state,"  he said, adding each farming family would
be given two hectares to cultivate.
     The farmers would be people from outside Kalimantan who had
agreed to be resettled under the government's transmigration scheme.

     But before being moved to the peatland project, they would
receive training in peatland farming methods since they had never
worked peatland before. IPB would contribute instructors for the
training.

    The minister said experts from IPB were also involved in the
preparation of a report on the environmental impact of the national
project.

ABILIO: DISCUSSION OF E. TIMOR ISSUE POSTPONED BECAUSE PORTUGAL IS AFRAID 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Dili, E Timor, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - East Timor Governor Abilio
Jose Osorio Soares said the postponement of the talks on the East
Timor issue in the 51st General Assembly session of the United
Nations increasingly indicated that Portugal was afraid of solving
the problem of the land that it has dominated for 450 years.
    "It is actually in the interest of Portugal to postpone the
talks on the East Timor issue, otherwise 'he' would certainly lose,"
the governor told the press on the postponement of the talks, after
closing a Golkar working conference in Dili on Saturday.
    "We can draw a conclusion that the postponement of the talks was
because Portugal was afraid it would lose in a voting in the United
Nations," he said.
    A solution to the issue at an international forum could be
reached through other means, such as through a tripartite meeting
between the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers under the
auspices of the United Nations Secretary General.

    However, if some day all countries would force a discussion of
the East Timor issue at the UN General Assembly, that would be the
time when Portugal can no longer refuse.
    The countries which have always abstained, should urge Portugal
to immediately accept the matter to be taken up at the UN General
Assembly for a solution, he said.
    The postponement was announced by a Dutch diplomat, Aryan P
Hamburger, at the General Affairs Committee session on September 18
discussing the agenda of the 51st UN General Assembly.
    The idea on the postponement was supported by the Philippine
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Felipe H
Mabilangan.  With no other delegates responding, the Committee
decided to postpone the talks on the East Timor issue and entered it
in the interim agenda of next year's UN General Assembly.
    Talks on the issue at the UN General Assembly have been
postponed 14 times since the subject was raised in 1983.
    Meanwhile, East Timor House Speaker Antonio Freitas Parada said
it would be useless to discuss the subject at the UN General
Assembly, because the integration of the former Portuguese colony
into the Republic of Indonesia has become a reality.
    Anti-integrationists abroad were only serving their sweet own
interest by using funds provided by non governmental organisations
in other countries to finance their activities, he said.
    Antonio pointed out that the most important thing for the people
of East Timor was to build the area with their own funds and forces.
    Other countries have become fed up with talking about the East
Timor issue, because in the 20 years of integration vast progress
has been made in the area, and in the welfare of the local
population.
    In the meantime, chairman of the East Timor chapter of the
ruling Golkar political party Armindo Soares Mariano said the party
wanted  an early settlement of the issue.  It would depend on the
Portuguese government, because it was them who made an issue out of
the integration in the first place, he pointed out.

TRADE WIND GROUP OF SAILBOATS EXPECTED IN KUPANG 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Some 40 foreign
sailboats  participating in a round-the-world voyage organized by
the Trade Wind Committee are expected to arrive here on October 3
for a three-day stop,  a spokesman for the local hosting committee
said.
     The group of sailboats with crew members totalling 150 people
began its journey at Gibraltar, south of Spain, last  October 23,
1995, according to Joseph Soenarto, a member of the hosting
committee, here Saturday.

    Most of the participants hailed from European countries and were
using British-registered boats, he said.

    From Gibraltar the group went westward and after   crossing  the
Atlantic Ocean  called at ports along the eastern parts of the
American continent until it sailed around the most southern tip of
South America to reach the Pacific.

    In the Pacific, the group made stops in Fiji, New Zealand and
Australia. It would arrive in Kupang from Darwin, Australia,
Soenarto said.

    The boats were scheduled to leave Darwin on Saturday and head
for Indonesia where after Kupang, they would also stop in Bali and
Jakarta before returning to Gibraltar.

    The journey would end in Gibraltar in October next year.

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bandung, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Delegates from Asia, Africa and
Europe as well as the United States agreed at  a five-day workshop
ending here Friday that traditional puppet shows are an important
media in development.

children's rights to solve problems of children living in poverty
and to support education for peace and development using modern and
traditional media.

    The workshop participants also agreed to set up partnerships
among themselves to further develop programs for the welfare of
their peoples, children in particular.

ABRI CHIEF : "OTB" REFERS TO PKI"S POLITICAL STRATEGY 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Armed Forces (ABRI) Chief General
Feisal Tanjung said here on Saturday the term "formless
organisation" (OTB) referred to the political strategy launched by
the outlawed Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) members rather than
to its semantic meaning.

    "It is therefore improper for a handful of people to ask for a
review of the term "OTB" from the standpoint of grammar," he told a
meeting  about the latent danger of communism among the younger
generation.

    If the term "OTB" was considered wrong from the standpoint of
grammar, this would only be logical as PKI members never knew how to
use the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia) correctly and
properly, he said.

    The PKI members only knew how to use force and opportunities as
well as to overthrow colleagues and enemies, he said.

    The term "OTB" originated from the PKI members themselves
instead of government apparatuses or ABRI members, he said.

    "I seems that it is naive if some people have vilely responded
to the statement issued by the ABRI about the term "OTB" some time
ago, by saying that it was the ABRI which is the "OTB" or Omong
Tanpa Bukti (speaking without evidence)," he said.

    Quoting the ABRI's intelligence and socio-political analysis of
finds in several regions, Tanjung said PKI had metamorphosed.

    "To most experts in communist teachings, the metamorphosis is
not new because it is a built-in process. The built-in process and
classical style however have often made us inattentive and less
watchful," he said.

    The ABRI chief said the PKI members also knew well how to win
the public's sympathy through the so-called peaceful and human
propaganda.

    He said the former PKI members had neither permanent friends nor
permanent enemies. They only thought of how to satisfy their
interests.

    "To satisfy their interests, the former PKI members can do
whatsoever by, for instance, adopting attitudes down from
democrat-like attitude to violent, radical, uncivilized and inhuman
actions," he said.

    "Through the peaceful propaganda the PKI members have made a
number of survival attempts or activities in the last 30 years," he
said.

BALI ADM STILL PONDERING FEASIBILTY OF JAA-BALI BRIDGE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Denpasar, Bali, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Bali's provincial

administration is still pondering the feasibility of  a Java-Bali
bridge and has yet to discuss the matter with the central
govertment, Bali Deputy Governor Ida Bagus Ardhana said here
Saturday.

    Ardhana, who is also chairman of Bali province's Regional
Development Planning Board (Bappeda), said the provincial
administration was considering the proposed Java-Bali bridge from
various aspects, namely  economic, environmental, infrastructural,
and also social and cultural.

    He said Bali's House of Representatives (DPRD) was doing
likewise with the help of inputs from  non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) , informal community leaders and various
concerned agencies.

    According to Ardhana, a preliminary study of the project's
feasibility was already made by a technical agency. "The Bali
administration will discuss the results of the study with its
counterpart in Java," he added.

    He said he believed a Java-Bali bridge would no doubt  smoothen
transportation of people and goods between the two islands.

    However, certain problems  needed to be resolved before the
bridge could actually be constructed.

    Among the problems was the fact that the capacity of Bali's land
transportation facilities were not matched to the normal traffic
flow from Java.

    "Road conditions in Bali should be improved to make them equal
to those in Java," he said.

    In Java, roads had already been made strong enough to
accommodate  containers which was not the case in Bali, he said.

    He also said the flow of people from Java would  become a
problem to the Bali administration if the bridge was realized.

    "Denpasar municipality and Badung district have a  higher
economic growth rate than Java because they have become tourist
destinations. Migration from Java will burden the two regions in
Bali," he added.

    If realised, the project on Bali's side would  be located in
Jembrana district, a region with a growth rate of only six percent,
the lowest among Bali's districts.  Bali's overall economic growth
rate was seven  percent per year during the last three five-year
development plans.

    "The low economic growth rate of Jembrana district has caused
small growth in jobs as well," he said, adding that the provincial
administration had had to enforce special  policies to help the
district's economic development.
     For instance, the provincial administration decided to stop
construction of new star-rated hotels in Badung district and
Denpasar in an effort to divert investors in the hotel industry to
Jembrana district.

    He said  the Bali administration had also developed five tourism
destinations in Jembrana. Jembrana, according Ardhana, had now
become a location for development of medium-scale industries.

MINISTER: TALKS ON ENVIRONMENTAL TAX ALREADY DONE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Denpasar, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - State Minister of Environment
Sarwono Kusumaatamadja has said there have already been talks
between his office and the directorate general of tax and excises
about the proposed environmental tax for motor vehicles.

    "We have discussed about the issue with that directorate
general," he said here over the weeken.

    Sarwono made the statement in response to the wish for the
imposition of environmental tax for motor vehicle as expressed by
Bali Governor Ida Bagus Oka at the inaugural ceremony of the first
liquified petroleum gas station in the attendance of Mines and
Energy Minister IB Sidjana on the resort island Saturday.

    According to him, his side was waiting for the proposal
currently being processed at the ministry of mines and energy.

    Prior to the imposition of the tax, people should first get
information on alternatives of fuel oil which is not difficult to
get in the country which is rich in energy, he said.

    By providing the people with various energy alternatives, the
government could then impose a progressive tax which on the other
hand  also provides incentive for users of environmentally-friendly
energy resources.

    In Jakarta around 700 taxi cabs have been using LPG fuel.

    The minister said by the end of the year around 20 new LPG
stations would be set up in the capital.

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Medan, Sept 29 (ANTARA) -- The Martabel dreamland in North
Sumatera currently under construction may become Indonesia's proud
in the international world.

    The mega project, the development of which was started in May
1996 in hilly and forested land near the Medan-Brastagi highway,
will have various sports facilities, including an international
standard 36-hole gold course, a dreamland, animal farm, water park,
cultural centre and 3,000 villas.

    This was said by head of the project Irawan Tjandra when

on Sunday, in the presence of operational director Antona Dihardjo,
financial director Wahi Kartono and marketing director Gavin J.
Rostron.

    They said the project was being built with funds provided by the
business community in North Sumatera under the coordination of North
Sumatera Governor Raja Inal Siregar and Irawan Tjandra.

    The investment in the project built in stages on 1,000 ha of
land and scheduled for completion in eight years, amounted to Rp 250
billion.

    In the first stage of the realisation of the project, according
to the operational and marketing directors, an 18-hole golf course
was being built under the supervision of Grantham Golf Construction
of the united States.

    The gold course, built on green hills with a number of man-made
lakes, is slated for completion in May 1997, but only with nine
holes.

    The building would then be continued with 18 holes designed by
world gold legend Greg Norman, which could be used for international
tournaments.

    The construction of the golf course to be named Martabe
Sejahtera Golf Club (MSGC) will be funded by the 250 founding
members each of whom with a shareholding of Rp 60 million.

    The next stage will be the building of a dreamland like the one
in Ancol, Jakarta, on 30 ha of land, an animal breeding farm on 100
ha, and a water park.

    Very specific buiildings in the Martabe dreamland include a park
for people of advance age and a cultural park with traditional
miniature houses of all parts of Indonesia.

    Also to be built in the complex are 3000 villas of standard
type, and 50 exclusive ones respectively on 5000 and 10,000 square
meters of land.

    Upon completion, Martabe may become the largest of its kind in
Indonesia encompassing sport and recreational facilities, a
dreamland and animal farm.

    "The dreamland will become one of the most comprehensive tourist
destination for foreign tourists visiting North Sumatera, and
another pride for Indonesia besides the one in Jakarta," Antona
Dihardja said.

    Meanwhile, the Malaysian businessmen, led by Datuk Lim Liong
Sek, they were very keen in becoming members of the Martabe
Sejahtera Gold Club as one of the concrete realisations of the
northern growth triangle involving Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

Persada said on a separate occasion that Indonesia Opportunities 96
has really become a national pride.

were reflected in the numerous wreaths expressing congratulations
from local leading business people.

     At least five memoranda of understanding have been signed
during the occasion, including two on big business deals between PT

toll road with an investment of Rp 913 billion, and between the

of cement factories, both in China and in Indonesia (two plants).

     The Chinese, Budi said, wished Indonesia to hold such trade
fairs on a regular basis to introduce Indonesia's trade potentials
to the Chinese business community.

     For promotional purposes, PT Indo Asean Persada signed a
cooperation agreement for the dissemination of information about the
Indonesian business world by a local media in 25 million copies of
its publication.

17 RESCUED AFTER INDONESIAN VESSEL SINKS OFF MALAYSIA 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Penang, Malaysia, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Seventeen Indonesian crew
were rescued  by local fishermen Sunday after their cargo vessel
sank during a storm off  Malaysia's northern island of Penang late
Friday.

    Police said a trawler found the Indonesians clinging to two
rafts made  from lifebuoys, plastic water bottles and life jackets,
at 2 a.m. Sunday  (1800 GMT Saturday), several miles off Penang
island.

    On reaching the island, the crew, aged 17 to 42 years, were
taken to the  police district headquarters to alert the authorities
who had already resumed their search at daybreak Sunday.

    District police chief superintendent Tan Seng Eng said all the
crew had  been accounted for after earlier reports said there were
18 on board.

    More than 60 rescuers and five marine police patrol boats were
engaged in the search for the crew and the 300-tonne ship, the KM
Kurnia Abadi. The ship has yet to be located.

    The vessel, which was transporting timber, left northern Sumatra
in Indonesia Thursday and was scheduled to dock at Penang port
Friday night.

    A distress signal was sent late Friday to the shipping agent in
Penang.

    Search efforts were hampered by rough seas and lack of
information on the  exact location of the vessel.

MEGAWATI TO SUE E JAKARTA ADMI FOR CLOSING NEW HQ 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Ousted chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati Sukarnoputri on Monday said she will
file a lawsuit to protest the sealing off of her new headquarters by
the East Jakarta mayor.

    A lawyer representing Megawati said the suit could be filed at
the State Administrative Court (PTUN) as early as Monday.

    "The lawsuit could hopefully be filed at the PTUN by Monday,"
said Pantas Nainggolan, one of Megawati's lawyers.

    East Jakarta Mayor Sudarsono on Friday closed the new
headquarters of Megawati's faction of the PDI, citing violations on
residential zoning laws.

    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, a member of the party executive
board, said they will continue with their daily activities in
another place.

    "We will start looking for a new headquarters and we will
announce it as soon as we find one," he said.

    The closure of the headquarters came exactly two months after
supporters of new PDI chairman Soerjadi forcibly took over the main
party headquarters in Central Jakarta on July 27.

    Nainggolan also disclosed plans to demand the closure of the

office of Soerjadi's faction in his residence.

    "We will urge the government to be consistent and close down
Soerjadi's office in his residence," Nainggolan said.

    Megawati's lawyers and supporters argued that the closure was
discriminatory because many homes in the Indonesian capital have
been converted into offices.

    Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership in June by a party
congress held by the rival faction which elected Soerjadi as new
chairman.

    Her ouster triggered widespread protests which led to the July
27 riots after the raid on the PDI headquarters.

INDONESIA WILL OPPOSE NEW ISSUES AT WTO MEETING 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia will reject new issues
raised by industrial countries at the WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore in December, Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo
said today.

     "We will reject discussion on new issues which might be brougt
by industrial nations, including multilateral agreement on
investment, labour standard, government purchases and the problem of
competition," Tunky told reporters after a meeting with President
Suharto.

     He said Indonesia will take a firm stand against discussing
these new issues, particularly when they are disfavouring the
country's national interest.

     Indonesia already has its own regulations on investment and
labour law which would not be sacrificed for the interest of the
planned multilateral agreement, he added.

     But Indonesia will participate in the discussion of all issues
already agreed upon at the Uruguay Round meeting in Marakesh two
years ago, Tunky said.

     He said Indonesian officials have been preparing necessary
materials to be brought to the Singapore meeting scheduled for mid
December.

     It would be the first WTO Ministerial meeting among trade and
economic minsters to be held, he said.

     He also reported to the President about his recent trip to
Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico to
promote Indonesia's industrial products to the region.

     Tunky said Indonesia has been suffering a large trade deficit
against Latin American countries over the years.

     Last year Indonesia exported some US$525 million worth of
commodities to 12 Latin American countries while its imports from
that region reached about US$1 billion, he said.

     Indonesia needs to intensify its trade promotion to Latin

American countries to win more direct trading because many
Indonesian goods and products have entered their market via a third
countries, he said.

    He added that the great sale not only targets foreign visitors

since our products are just as competitive (as those found abroad),"
he said while observing the preparations for the great sale.

Surakarta and Mangkunegaran sultanate palaces and other public
places.

HAMID TURNS OVER TAPES OF PRD ACTIVISTS" SPEECHES TO ISLAMIC SCHOOL 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jombang, E Java, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Armed Forces (ABRI) chief of
social and political affairs, Lt Gen Syarwan Hamid, on Sunday turned
over to the Tebuireng Islamic boarding school cassette recordings of
speeches made by activists of the People's Democratic Party (PRD).

    The cassette tapes, received by school caretaker KH Yusuf
Hasyim, were meant to serve as a reminder of the atrocities of the
Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in their 1948 and 1965 revolts.

    Hamid said the speeches, delivered by PRD chairman Budiman
Sudjatmiko and Dita Indah Sari who are both under detention, reflect
the group's communist ideology.

    He called on the younger generations not to follow their
examples and instead increase their awareness of communist
activities to protect the country from the latent dangers of
communism.

    He noted that PKI remnants and the wide social gap in the
country could still lead to the revival of communism.

    Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher, who was also present,
urged Indonesian moslems to be vigilant of communist elements who
try to infiltrate religious groups.

    The government has blamed the PRD for inciting the July 27 riots
which rocked Jakarta, killing at least five and injuring scores of
others.

MPS CALLS FOR HALT TO OPENING OF TUNNEL NEAR AL AQSA MOSQUE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - The House of Representatives (DPR)
on Monday urged Israel to halt the opening of a new archaeological
tunnel near Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, saying the move is hurting
the world Moslem community.

    "I am very concerned about the Israeli move because the Al Aqsa
Mosque is sacred to Moslems.  That is why I call on Israel to scrap
the move to open the new tunnel," Abu Hasan Sazili of the Functional
Group (Golkar) at the DPR said.

    He said Israel should be consistent with its previous commitment
to creating peace in the Middle East.

    "The world community will respect Israel, if the Benjamin
Netanyahu government refrains from such an arrogant and one-sided
action," he said.

    He also appealed to Arab countries to remain united in the face
of the Israeli move to open the new tunnel.

    Meanwhile, chief of the House Commission on foreign affairs,
information, defence and security, Aisyah Aminy, said the Israeli
move is inseparable from Netanyahu's policy.

    She said the Israeli prime minister has given priority to his
personal and group interests, while ignoring the peace agreement
reached by his predecessor and the Palestinian leadership.

    If the Netanyahu government is serious in creating peace, it
must halt the opening of the new tunnel, she said.

    She urged Israel to immediately take concrete steps to create
peace in the Middle East.

    "Peace should become the goal, otherwise there will never be
peace between Palestine and Israel and in the Middle East," she
said.

    Abu Hasan Sazili also appealed to the United States not to
defend Israeli interests.

    "The United States should not adopt double standards, where on
one hand it longs for peace in the Middle East, but on the other
hand continues to assist Israel in every international forum, such
as the United Nations," he said.

    Meanwhile, H Imam Churmen said the opening of the new tunnel is
not only the problem of Palestinians but also the global Moslem
community.

    "The Israeli government must know that the building is a sacred
place of worship for Moslems, Christians and other religious
followers.  It is only logical if the world community has seriously
responded to the opening of the tunnel and pressed for its halt,"
Churmen said.

    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry on Friday issued a statement
strongly condemning the opening of the tunnel and the shooting of
Palestinians by Israeli troops.

    At least 53 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed in the
worst riots since the West Bank and Gaza came under Israeli
occupation in 1967.

    The statement calls for restraint from all sides in the conflict
and respect for existing peace agreements.

RIAU"S COAL RESOURCES ABLE TO GENERATE 1000 MW OF POWER 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Pekanbaru, Riau, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Riau has not only oil but
also coal resources which can generate thousand megawatts of
electricity, a Riau official has said.

    The head of the provincial mines office, Gaffar Siddik, said
here on Monday that survey results had revealed the presence of two
million tonnes of coal reserves in the Cerent area, Indragiri Hulu
district, which so far had not been exploited.

    "PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem (coal mining company) is at
present conducting surveys in this area and according to an original
plan a powerplant will be set up with a total capacity of 2 x 600
MW," Gaffar said.

    But there is also a possibility that the coal will be processed
for marketing abroad and that depends on the processor's calculation
whether it is more profitable to use the coal for power generating

or for marketing abroad, he added.

    According to the mines office chief, apart from PT Batu Bara
Bukit Asam, a Malaysian investor is also interested in utilizing the
coal in Cerenti for power generating.

    If the Malaysian side as well as PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem
are interested in conducting similar activities they can cooperate,
because according to plan the projected power plant will have a
total capacity of 2 x 600 Mw, and part of its production can be
exported to Malaysia, Gaffar said.

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto called on the
management board of the 74-year old Taman Siswa educational
institution not to hesitate to set up cooperations with other bodies
to boost its development.

    The Ki Hajar Dewantara Foundation was formed to obtain financial
assistance for Taman Siswa.

    Soesilo, an alumnus of Taman Siswa who is now the coordinating
minister for political and security affairs, expressed concern that
the absence of significant improvement will make it difficult for
the institution to attract more students.
