<hr>
Dr Grandison gained his BSc and PhD at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Liverpool. He joined the Department of Food Science and Technology as a Lecturer in 1987 following appointments at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and the National Institute for Research in Dairying (later Institute of Food Research). 
<p>
<b>Research Interests</b> are in food processing science and include the following:-
<ul>
<li>Separation processes in food processing, including the use of membranes and ion exchange for the recovery of materials from waste streams.
<li>Fouling and cleaning of food processing surfaces. Work is in progress to understand the mechanisms of deposit formation on heated surfaces during thermal processing of dairy and other food fluids. Studies are also aimed at understanding the mechanisms of flux decline due to fouling and concentration polarisation during membrane processing.
<li>The relationships between milk composition and its processing characteristics.
<li>The use of low dose electron beam irradiation in combination with other treatments for improving the microbiological quality and shelf life of food.
<li>The fate of radionuclides during processing of foods.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Teaching Interests</b> are in the general areas of food engineering and food chemistry. Specific topics include raw material properties and preliminary operations of food processing, heat processing, separation processes, irradiation, proteins and lipids of foods, and dairy chemistry and technology.
<p>
<b>Industrial links.</b> Dr Grandison collaborates with industry on several research projects and is a key member of the “Centre for Applied Process Technology” which carries out research and development work for industry.
