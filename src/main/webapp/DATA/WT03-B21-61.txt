<H2>How To Manage Your Investments <BR>
Successfully <BR>
When You Don't Have The Time <BR>
Or Inclination</H2>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Content Summary</B> 
<P>
<B>There's no question that most people today have the judgment
and ability to manage their own money. And certainly they have
enough resources and advice at hand to do so - what with newspaper
columns, newsletters, investment guides, seminars and radio and
TV programs devoted exclusively to investment strategies.</B>

<P>
<B>Trouble is, most people either don't have the time, or the
inclination - or sometimes the discipline - to watch over what
they have. Especially when there are <U>so</U> <U>many </U>choices
to make - and so <U>much</U> <U>work</U> involved in evaluating
them all.</B> 
<P>
<B>Instead, busy people today are more inclined to put their energies
into getting more out of life; to letting other responsible people
worry about their money, so they won't have to.</B> 
<P>
<B>This paper presents some essential, broad guidelines to consider
when deciding how to</B> <BR>
<B>handle investments. Most importantly, it focuses on the questions
to ask should you <BR>
be thinking about outside help.</B><HR>

<H4><TT><B>How Times Have Changed</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Not so long ago, very few people had to worry about handling
large sums of money or extensive investment portfolios. The &quot;rich&quot;
were few and far between. And those that had money usually had
so much of it that they could afford to have professional people
watch over it full time.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>These days -- thanks to things like generous retirement payouts
-- careful saving, investment and financial planning practices
... and, of course life insurance settlements ... more people
than ever have large sums of money to handle. It's not uncommon,
for example, for one partner in a marriage to pre-decease the
other -- leaving a substantial, and often unexpected, amount of
insurance money or investments behind.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Whatever the case -- while they may be not like the very rich
of years ago -- larger numbers of &quot;average&quot; people are
faced with money management questions.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Choosing a Money Management Strategy</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>As with everything else, time may be the most important factor
in determining how to manage money. With time on your hands, you
can explore the many options available -- stocks and bonds, mutual
funds, CDs and other bank instruments, precious metals ... including
their degree of risk, tax implications, the impact of inflation
and the like.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>There's no shortage of &quot;advice&quot; available in helping
you decide what to do. Brokers, financial planners and bankers
are always available to give you some direction -- as are countless
investment publications and guidebooks, not to mention talk-shows
on both TV and radio.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Having <U>time</U>, though, is of the essence. First, it will
take considerable time just to gather your own personal information
together and establish your objectives. You must identify your
specific financial strengths and weaknesses -- evaluate your portfolio
... and determine what, exactly, are your financial goals. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Then, you have to be prepared to read and do research ...
to evaluate and analyze ... to investigate, interview and <U>probe</U>
deeply into all the &quot;paths to riches&quot; which will come
across your desk regularly. And, of course, you have to be ready
to act quickly -- otherwise, critical windows of opportunity will
be missed.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>The question is, do you <U>have</U> the time -- or more exactly,
do you want to <U>spend</U> the time -- watching over your finances
and managing your investments? The answer is maybe -- especially
if you've just reached a well-deserved retirement, have a time-consuming
interest or avocation ... or are actively involved with grandchildren
or community affairs. Or perhaps you're still involved with your
career or running a business.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Getting The Help You Need</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Whether you've managed to accumulate a substantial investment
portfolio over the years, or simply just received a a retirement
payout or inheritance -- chances are, as indicated above, you
don't have enough hours in the day to manage it. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Beyond that, it's likely you don't have the <U>discipline</U>,
either. For, as diligent as you may be in all other aspects of
your life, it's difficult to muster the <U>daily,</U> <U>full-time</U>
monitoring and precise record-keeping that profitable money management
requires.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Without the time, inclination or discipline, then -- what's
left? For many successful people, a <U>Personal</U> <U>Money</U>
<U>Manager</U> is the answer -- a trained professional who can
offer the advice and expertise required to help you keep what
you have -- and to make it grow.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Just from the standpoint of <U>confidence </U>alone, a Money
Manager is probably just what you need to help shape fundamental
decisions and re-affirm your own judgments about where you want
to go.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>For example, a Money Manager can help you analyze your financial
position and portfolio initially -- then define and set realistic
goals. Are you looking for stability .... for long-term growth
... for current income? Is there a major objective on the horizon
like a new house or a child's or grandchild's education? </TT>
<P>
<TT>Actually, making the decision to employ a Personal Money Manager
involves the same kind of commitment you make when picking a doctor
or a lawyer. You simply decide that you have confidence in his
or her judgment and that you'd like the relationship to be on-going.
Your Money Manager will get to know you as an individual ... get
to know your financial &quot;personality&quot; ... so that investment
decisions, in general terms, can be based on the way <U>you</U>
want things done.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>You want to work with a Manager you <U>like</U>, of course
-- one who is responsive, interested, and understanding. You want
to make sure you're on the same wave length ... that you both
have a clear understanding about where you want to be headed.
Your financial situation -- but mostly your <U>goals</U> ... and
attitude toward risk ... must be in clear focus before you take
another step. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Once you and your manager get a &quot;fix&quot; on where you
want to go and why, then it's a question of getting out from under
the troublesome details. The day-to-day research, monitoring and
paperwork is turned over to the professionals. Your Manager handles
the fine points; you and your financial objectives control the
basic direction of your portfolio.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>How To Take The First Steps In Selecting A Personal
Money Manager</B> </TT></H4>

<P>
<TT>Again, when thinking about a Money Manager it's a good idea
-- first -- to make sure your financial objectives are well-defined.
Write down your goals; make certain you take everything into account,
including long-term debt ... and any &quot;big dreams&quot; you
hope may come true someday. In the process of picking a Money
Manager, questions about your goals will come up frequently. So
get them written down and keep them handy.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Choose from several candidates</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Make a list of several Money Managers and plan to interview
them by phone or mail -- or if possible, in person. (Look in the
Yellow Pages under &quot;Investment Counselors or Advisers.&quot;
Or ask a Banker, Lawyer or Accountant friend for some suggestions).
</TT>
<P>
<TT>Ask each Manager to send you written material. You'll want
to volunteer some information &quot;up front&quot; about yourself,
your financial resources and your goals -- just so prospective
Managers can decide whether you're a good &quot;match.&quot; Whatever
you do, get in touch with several possible candidates.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Look at credentials</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Ask to see a copy of the Manager's Form ADV -- the Uniform
Application for Investment Adviser Registration, which must be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It will
tell you all about a potential Manager's education, experience
and background.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Questions To Ask A Money Manager</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>First, don't be reluctant to ask about <U>anything</U>. After
all, it's your money you're talking about ultimately. Besides,
you'll be expected to ask questions. That's what builds the rapport
that's so important to a good long-term relationship.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>What services will be provided?</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>In general terms, a Money Manager will manage your assets
on a day-to-day basis -- according to the guidelines you agree
on mutually. But what else? Will the Manager help you with portfolio
analysis? Tax questions? All transfers and paperwork? Regular
reports? Financial planning? <U>Find</U> <U>out</U>.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>What techniques will be used in handling your investments?</B></TT>
</H4>

<P>
<TT>Money Managers have different approaches -- methods -- in
meeting investment objectives. Ask what types of investments a
Manager prefers -- and why his or her &quot;philosophy&quot; will
work for you. Are they primarily in mutual funds, or junk bonds
or blue chip stocks? What is the strategy or &quot;game plan?&quot;
What's the safety factor -- how has the track record been up to
now, especially <I>over the long term</I>?</TT> 
<P>
<TT>It's simply a question of asking the Manager about his or
her approach to managing money -- how they will match your objectives
with investment opportunities.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>How are fees set? </B></TT></H4>

<P>
<TT>A Personal Manager should be working to improve your financial
well-being -- and not to earn commissions or sales fees based
on individual transactions. You should never feel any sales pressure
-- or that there is a conflict of interest.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>It's best to look for a Money Manager who is compensated by
set fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management.
Be sure to discuss the specifics. And if your potential Manager
uses Mutual Funds, ask about management fees and other expenses
charged by the funds. Sometimes they are assessed over and above
the Manager's fee -- which is a system you should avoid.</TT>

<H4><TT><B>What kinds of clients do you serve?</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>A Money Manager who focuses on large institutional accounts
may not be right for you. Try to discover what type and size accounts
your candidate handles generally. That way you can avoid being
&quot;lost in the shuffle&quot; should his or her interest be
in very large portfolios primarily.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Ask about the success rate with clients having portfolios
of your size precisely. And again, when asking about results --
be sure that results <I>over a long term</I> are reported to you.</TT>

<H4><TT><B>What about reviews and reporting - how frequent?</B>
</TT></H4>

<P>
<TT>Money Managers have widely different ideas about reviewing
and reporting on accounts. It's wise to ask how often your portfolio
will be reviewed -- and how frequently you will receive written
reports on its progress. Monthly reviews should be expected --
as well as quarterly written reports, at least.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Where will assets be held - who is in control? </B></TT>
</H4>

<P>
<TT>When you<B> </B>sign on with a Money Manager, your assets
will be held in an account with a broker or other financial institution.
But you should always have personal access to your funds. Ask
your Money Manager candidates about procedures; they will need
a limited power of attorney to buy and sell investments -- and
to re-invest the proceeds -- on your behalf. Ask about safeguards,
however. How will your account be protected against unauthorized
transfers or transactions not in keeping with your objectives?</TT>

<H4><TT><B>What about references?</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Ask for professional references -- such as from attorneys,
CPAs or established professional people. You should also feel
free to ask for an extensive list of clients -- especially those
known to have similar objectives to your own. Your Money Manager
should be willing to give you the information, including telephone
numbers. With references in hand, you should not be the least
bit reluctant to call and ask questions -- including those about
the personality and temperament of Money Manager you're considering.
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>* * * * * *</B></TT> 
<P>
<TT><B>While most people who have an above-average investment
portfolio are tempted to watch over it themselves, rarely are
they satisfied with the results. Those who are responsible for
money today simply have too many choices ... face too many decisions
... to meet with success on a part-time basis. To protect money
and make it grow, professional, full-time management is virtually
mandated these days.</B></TT> 
<P>
<TT><B>Although people with money still have strong opinions about
what to do with it, the wisest among them look to qualified professionals
for help. After all, the greatest dividend money earns is in buying
time -- to enjoy life's pleasures. </B></TT><HR>
