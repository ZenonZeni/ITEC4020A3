STOPPAGE IN THE REGION </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>BRASILIA. (MP).-
Integration spirit is not only limited to government and business
decisions: trade unions of the six Mercosur countries have a
supranational co-ordinating committee and coinciding with the
Fortaleza presidential summit they organised a relatively
successful general stoppage of several hours</strong>. Besides
the 17th of December was declared the &quot;<em>International Day
for the struggle of the human rights of the Mercosur Workers</em>&quot;,
and will be celebrated annually. During the presidential summit,
representatives of the main eight Mercosur workers unions, plus
an American representative for the American Workers Federation
and the Congress of Industrial Organisations, held a meeting in
Fortaleza and released a document with a list of common demands.
Top of the list was the creation of mechanisms for collective
negotiations on working conditions and salaries at Mercosur
level, plus more legal space in the block's decision making
process, for social organisations including non government
organisations (NGO). Secondly a Bill of Rights, based on
regulations and agreements of the International Labour
Organisation (ILT); thirdly a policy for promoting jobs,
productive reconversion and retraining in new trades. In spite of
growing economies, unemployment has become one of the worst fears
and threats for workers in Mercosur countries: the official rates
are as follows: Argentina 17%, Brazil 14%, Uruguay 12%, Chile 8%.</font></p>
