<h1 align=center>Marin County Police Chief
<br>Supports Medical Marijuana Initiative</h1>

<p><b>February 14, 1996, Fairfax, CA: </b>Jim Anderson, a long-time police
chief for the town of Fairfax is one of the latest law enforcement officials
to speak out in favor of California's current medical marijuana initiative.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe there is adequate unbiased and scientific evidence that
marijuana does have medicinal benefit. When we consider the associated
consequences of other prescription drugs it seems illogical to exclude
marijuana as another alternative available to physicians for prescription.
...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Even if there are no other benefits than relief of pain or
stimulation of appetite, there appears to be a legitimate place for marijuana
in the wide array of legally prescribed drugs. The legalization of marijuana
for medicinal purposes seems to strike a reasonable balance between the
abuse and illegal use of the drug and its legitimate medicinal value that
could be available through prescriptive use.</p>

<p>&quot;With the increased public attention on my own support of the medicinal
use of marijuana, I find that many other conservative persons share this
belief. ...Marijuana is not the street degenerate that ravages society.&quot;</p>

<p>Anderson has been employed in law enforcement and public safety since
1964 and has been a police chief for 14 years. He is also a member of the
U.S. Army Reserve with rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
