<B>NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY DAY DE-BRIEFING</B><BR>

<P>Pooling their experience and desire to help families, home school leaders representing 48 states<BR>
gathered in Washington, D.C., on March 7 for the National Legislative Strategy Day<BR>
sponsored by Home School Legal Defense Association. A banquet the evening before gave<BR>
leaders a chance to renew old acquaintances and make new friends. But early Thursday morning,<BR>
participants were ready to seriously study the issues which will affect home schooling in the next<BR>
year.<BR>

<P>HSLDA attorneys Michael Farris, Christopher Klicka, and Doug Phillips briefed the home<BR>
school leaders on the latest developments and strategies concerning a host of federal issues. The<BR>
topics included the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, the national registry and<BR>
identification system in the Immigration bill, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the<BR>
Child, abolishing the federal role in education, and the Careers Act. Several U.S. Senators and<BR>
Representatives addressed the gathering on these issues, as well.<BR>

<P>Even with the days intense schedule, leaders found moments to laugh together, share hopeful<BR>
stories from their home states, and affirm the hard work of legislators who want to help the<BR>
family. Thunderous applause greeted each of the congressmen who took time out of their busy<BR>
schedules to address the group. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) rallied the troops by calling out,<BR>
Christ is risen! eliciting the hearty response, He is risen indeed! <BR>

<P>On March 8, HSLDAs Congressional Action Program coordinated a full lobbying day on<BR>
Capitol Hill to coincide with the home school leaders visit to Washington. As constituents,<BR>
many of the leaders were able to meet directly with their U.S. Senators and Representatives.<BR>

<P>Afterwards, the leaders returned to their states, armed with information to spread throughout<BR>
their home school networks. <BR>

MICHAEL NEWS PETITION DENIED<BR>

<P>Michael News petition for writ of habeas corpus hearing was held on March 18, 1996. Michael<BR>
Farris, along with Herb Titus and lead counsel Ronald D. Ray, appeared before Judge Paul<BR>
Friedman in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to argue that the federal courts<BR>
should accept Army Specialist News case before the military courts have finished the appellate<BR>
process.<BR>

<P>Attorney Robert Shapiro (not the same attorney who represented O.J. Simpson) argued for the<BR>
government that the military should retain jurisdiction over Michael News discharge.<BR>

<P>Ten days later, Judge Friedman denied the petition. In his 18-page opinion, Judge Friedman<BR>
signaled that the New case is very important, but like the military judge he refused to rule on<BR>
the merits of the case.<BR>

<P>Friedman wrote, The consequences of holding that a serviceman on active duty can unilaterally<BR>
escape military jurisdiction . . . could be disruptive to military discipline, obedience, and<BR>
confidence.<BR>

<P>Colonel Ronald D. Ray, said of the ruling:<BR>
     The Clinton Administration admitted and does not dispute any of the defenses<BR>
     facts presented in the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. The federal judge, like<BR>
     the military judge failed to rule upon the heart of the casethat the President<BR>
     clearly lacks any authority to order the wearing of the unauthorized UN uniform<BR>
     or the fact that the entire deployment to Macedonia was unlawful, not having the<BR>
     proper Congressional approval for this UN military mission staffed by U.S.<BR>
     soldiers.<BR>

<P>Judge Friedmans decision will be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, the next<BR>
step in the military court proceedings will be for General Montgomery Meigs, the Commanding<BR>
General, to rule on the bad-conduct discharge. Colonel Ray will travel to Germany to plead<BR>
Michael News case before the general.<BR>

<P>A Rebuttal  Guest Comment<BR>

<P>A Public School Principal Praises Home Schooling<BR>
     by Jim Green<BR>
Your Dec. 10 editorial, Trust but verify, has certainly given me much cause for concern. I<BR>
believe your focus on home schooling was good, healthy and thought provoking, but Id feel<BR>
better if you more accurately portrayed the public school system.<BR>

<P>I am a public school principal. My school, the Ida Flood Dodge Traditional School of<BR>
Educational Excellence, a Magnet Middle School, is home to students from about 60 public and<BR>
private elementaries.<BR>

<P>We are ethnically diverse and a rough representation of the Tucson Unified School District<BR>
middle school. My experience (5.5 years in this job) indicates that all is not wellor getting<BR>
betterin public education.<BR>

<P>Your editorial closed quoting Ted Sizers paradoxical ideal of a loose system that has rigor.<BR>
I maintain that our present public system is a loose system that lacks rigor.<BR>

<P>Several points in your editorial demand attention. Your lead paragraph opines that home<BR>
schooled children need a modest, unobtrusive, but still rigorous testing regime. Later you write<BR>
or perhaps districts could administer brief, focused tests every two years, the minimum<BR>
frequency professionals say can aid students and parents.<BR>

<P>At present tests are administered in fourth, seventh and 11th grades to public school students.<BR>
A student can fail all these tests and much of the course work and still be promoted.<BR>

<P>I my district, a seventh-grade student can fail the test, fail all four quarters of language arts and<BR>
mathematics and still be promoted. Worse, some schools promote all students regardless of<BR>
effort. Clever, but misguided, students know these conditions and are content to idly give away<BR>
their academic heritage.<BR>

<P>You suggest home school students showing poor progress should be returned to public education.<BR>
Where would you send the multitude of public school students doing poorly?<BR>

<P>Your article quotes Mary Grace Wendel, an education service coordinator for the Pima County<BR>
School Superintendents office. Wendels statement that parent attempts to avoid violence and<BR>
gang problems are negative rationales for home school is her opinion. I would term that a<BR>
positive rational.<BR>

<P>In spite of the police sweeps in downtown Tucson, nothing is really being done about truancy.<BR>
Juveniles roam this city in spite of school attendance law. I know several home schoolers and<BR>
they are doing a fine job of education.<BR>

<P>Your suspicion that home school may mean no school is no more likely to be accurate than<BR>
to say public school may mean no school.<BR>

<P>I do not mean to bash public schools. I am a public school product; my children were; and my<BR>
grandchildren all are public school students. Public school is my livelihood, and two of my<BR>
children are public school teachers.<BR>

<P>I am proud of Dodge Middle School, our dedicated, wonderful staff and of the vast majority of<BR>
our hard working, achieving students. However, all is not well in public education. It is my<BR>
opinion the problems of home schooling pale by comparison with the problems of public school.<BR>

<P>I also believe that if we appropriately address public school problems that home schooling will<BR>
essentially disappear. Home schooling consists of hard work with multiple preparations for up<BR>
to six subjects per day per student, multiplied by the number of children. In public school, we<BR>
cannot require a teacher to do more than three preparations.<BR>

<P>Surely if we can provide a safe, secure environment and a stimulating academic program, then<BR>
home schooling will be difficult to justify. However, if we fail to do so, home schooling may<BR>
be the majority classroom in the not too distant future.<BR>

<P>               Jim Green is the principal of Dodge Middle School.<BR>

<P>Recently, as I sat in a gathering of enthusiastic home educators, I was struck by the rich<BR>
common enterprise they have launchedan enterprise that flourishes despite the absence of<BR>
central planning or government assistance. . . . In the sweep of history, this is a radical idea,<BR>
and one still frequently challenged in many corners of the world. Yet in that roomand in the<BR>
vibrant grass-roots movement represented thereI saw confirmation that Americas founders<BR>
were right to put such faith in common people.<BR>

<B>COVER STORY:</B> RALLY DRAWS RECORD CROWD TO INDIANA CAPITOL<BR>

<P>Nearly 2,000 parents and children gathered inside the Capitol Building in Indianapolis on<BR>
Monday, March 4, making the Parental Rights Rally the second largest in the history of the<BR>
state. <BR>

<P>As the parental rights bill came under increased attack, the Indiana Association of Home<BR>
Educators and Home School Legal Defense Association worked together to quickly organize a<BR>
rally for the following week.<BR>

<P>On the day of the rally, home schooling families began arriving in Indianapolis from all over<BR>
the state. The crowd in the capital spilled over from the main hall into the upper balconies and<BR>
stairways, squeezing in to hear Christopher Klicka and several state legislators speak about<BR>
parental rights. After the rally, children delivered stuffed animals to each legislator. Every<BR>
animal wore a tag around its neck which read, Dear Representative/Senator, My parents know<BR>
best. All tags were signed by the children who donated the animals.<BR>

<P>Although the rally was covered by many local television stations and newspapers, it was given<BR>
only the barest notice in the largest Indiana paper, the Indianapolis Star, which has been running<BR>
articles featuring the Indiana State Teachers Associations opposition to the PRA. Indiana parents<BR>
continue to lobby their state representatives in hopes that the PRA will come up again in the next<BR>
legislative session. They hope repeated positive contact will convince legislators that parents<BR>
really do know best.<BR>

<P>
<P>H.B. 1346: THE OUTCOME<BR>

<P>Indiana went on a roller-coaster ride in February and March, as home schoolers went into a<BR>
pitched battle against the Indiana State Teachers Association, Planned Parenthood, and the rest<BR>
of Hillary Clintons village people. In November 1995, a Marion County Superior Court<BR>
judge ruled that parents have no fundamental Fourteenth Amendment right to direct the secular<BR>
education of their children. This ruling undercuts the constitutional basis for home schooling,<BR>
and turns the right to educate children at home into a government privilege. Indiana home<BR>
schools are treated as nonaccredited private schools, but this court ruling would subject that<BR>
status to the whims of the legislature.<BR>

<P>Home schoolers fought back in a massive rally at the Indiana state capitol on March 4, 1996.<BR>
Close to 2,000 people gathered to ask their legislators to send a strong signal in favor of parental<BR>
rights by supporting House Bill 1346. This legislation would guarantee that parents have the<BR>
fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children and guarantee parents certain due<BR>
process rights during child welfare investigations. <BR>

<P>The size of the crowd set records and made a significant impact on the entire legislature. The<BR>
legislature was supposed to wrap up its business some forty-eight hours after the rally, but the<BR>
battle over parental rights dragged the session out for the rest of the week. Although H.B. 1346<BR>
passed, the section declaring parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their<BR>
child was deleted. Senator Howard Luke Kenley [R-20th], who claims to be a pro-family<BR>
conservative, singlehandedly forced the removal of the parental rights language. The Indiana<BR>
State Teachers Association hot-line message has been thanking Senator Kenley for stopping the<BR>
parental rights bill.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Associations Michael Farris, Christopher Klicka, and Scott<BR>
Somerville all worked together to try to help Senator Kenley and other legislators understand the<BR>
constitutional dimensions of parents rights, and to help draft constitutionally appropriate<BR>
language protecting parents rights. Even through the parental rights language was removed from<BR>
H.B. 1346, the House and Senate did pass it in an amended form. As now written, it trims back<BR>
the child abuse investigations, puts some teeth in the laws against false and malicious child abuse<BR>
reports, and sets up a study committee to document how parental rights are being trampled in<BR>
Indiana. A special thanks goes to Representative John Padfield who led the charge for parents<BR>
rights.<BR>

<P>The net result? A first down, not a touchdown. Parents are better off than they were, but there<BR>
is still a long way to go. The Indiana Association of Home Educators and the Home School<BR>
Legal Defense Association are committed to continuing this battleeven though it will mean<BR>
direct confrontations with the teachers unionsuntil parents rights are clearly recognized under<BR>
Indiana law.<BR>

<B>NATIONAL CENTER REPORTS: </B>FREEDOM WATCH<BR>

<P>
<P>The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946/S. 984)<BR>
The list of co-sponsors for the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA) has grown to<BR>
more than 130 in the House and 10 in the Senate. <BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association and the National Center for Home Education have been<BR>
working with the congressional sponsors to fine-tune the language of the bill.<BR>

<P>On March 7, the National Center sponsored a legislative briefing on Capitol Hill for state home<BR>
school leaders from 46 states. Many congressmen addressed the group on the PRRA. On March<BR>
8, the National Center organized an intensive lobbying day with our Congressional Action<BR>
Program volunteers and visiting state home school leaders. Many of the participants were able<BR>
to personally visit with U.S. Senators and Representatives to gain support for the PRRA and<BR>
immigration/tracking amendment (see accompanying article).<BR>

<P>The House and Senate sub-committees currently considering the PRRA are expected to issue<BR>
favorable reports. At this time, however, no dates have been set for the PRRA to be considered<BR>
by the full Judiciary Committees in either chamber.<BR>

<P>Action: Home schoolers need to continue to deliver a steady stream of calls to their Senators<BR>
and Representatives to build support for the PRRA. The implications of this bill make it a<BR>
priority.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child<BR>
Thirty-seven Senators have expressed their opposition in writing to the ratification of the U.N.<BR>
Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the battle is not over. Left-wing childrens<BR>
rights groups are heavily lobbying the Clinton Administration and selected Senators for<BR>
ratification. <BR>

<P>On January 17, 1996, UNICEF issued a press release titled, Child Rights Convention Close<BR>
to Universal Acceptance With 186 Ratifications; Only Six More to Go. It began, <BR>
     The United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) today announced that only six<BR>
     countries remained until universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of<BR>
     the Child. The Convention has broken all records as the most widely accepted<BR>
     human rights treaty in history with the ratification by 186 state parties. . . . <BR>
          The only six countries in the world which have yet to ratify are<BR>
     Switzerland, United States, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Emirates, and Somalia.<BR>
     Switzerland and the United States have already signed indicating their intention<BR>
     to ratify. . . . <BR>
          Ratification of the Convention obligates governments to bring their laws<BR>
     in line with the Convention. . . . <BR>
          But ratification of the Convention is itself just another step in a much<BR>
     bigger process. Governments, communities, and children themselves must work<BR>
     together to make the Convention a living charter for childrens rights. In bringing<BR>
     a new legal focus of childrens issues, countries are now enacting new laws, and<BR>
     amending national legislation to conform with the Conventions provisions.<BR>
     Special legal codes for children have been promulgated. Reports to the Committee<BR>
     of the Rights of the Child, and other sources cites specific examples of basic<BR>
     measures countries are taking to comply with the Convention. <BR>
          In Mexico, for instance, the constitutionally recognized Convention is<BR>
     considered supreme law of the land.<BR>

<P>Action: Remain vigilant. Remember, unratified treaties never die; they can always be brought<BR>
up for a vote. Home schoolers are encouraged to continue sending letters to their Senators,<BR>
reminding them to vote against ratification. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Abolishing the Federal Role in Education<BR>
Home School Legal Defense Association and the National Center for Home Education are<BR>
continuing to meet with Senators and Congressmen to promote the Restoring Local Schools Act.<BR>
Home schoolers should wait to encourage their legislators to sign on as co-sponsors until a<BR>
sponsor is secured and a bill number assigned.<BR>

<P>A number of the of the Republican presidential candidates advocated abolishment of the<BR>
Department of Education. This is significant, because the more that the issue is debated, the<BR>
more palatable abolishment becomes to the body politic.<BR>

<P>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution of Arlington, Virginia, has released a paper entitled, Who<BR>
Got It Right? What Proponents and Opponents of the Creation of the Department of Education<BR>
Promised and Predicted. The two aspects of the study which are particularly significant are a)<BR>
an account of the origin of the Department of Education, and b) statistics showing the poor track<BR>
record of the Department of Education.<BR>

<P>The paper, authored by John E. Berthoud, Ph.D., Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville<BR>
Institution, focuses on six key areas: 1) benefits for school children; 2) overhead &amp; bureaucracy;<BR>
3) efficiency; 4) local control; 5) cost; and 6) values. For each area Dr. Berthoud quotes what<BR>
the supporters promised, what the opponents predicted (see below), and then, based on the data<BR>
of the last 17 years, demonstrates the reality that Department of Education has reduced local<BR>
control, increased the cost, reduced the efficiency, and eroded the values of public education.<BR>

<P>     Copies of Who Got It Right? are available from the National Center for Home<BR>
     Education, P.O. Box 125, Paeonian Springs, VA 22129; (540) 338-5600. With<BR>
     your request, please include a self-addressed, 9x13 envelope, metered or<BR>
     stamped with 78¢ postage.<BR>

<P>
<P>Opponents to the establishment of the Department of Education:<BR>
Senator Moynihan and I have joined in opposing this bill. We have both been teachers for a<BR>
long time. But it appears that our colleagues would rather listen to the unfounded pleas of people<BR>
who know only that there are problems in our schools today, but who do not know how to solve<BR>
them. . . . I wish someone would tell me how this new department is going to make our children<BR>
literate? Or how it will erase the violence that has erupted in our schools? . . .<BR>
     Senator S.I. Hayakawa [R-CA, and former President of San Francisco State College],<BR>
     Congressional Record, September 24, 1979, Page 25826.<BR>

<P>This is a back room deal, born out of squalid politics. Everything we had thought we would<BR>
not see happening to education is happening here.<BR>
     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan [D-NY],Congressional Record, July 11, 1979, Page<BR>
     18038.<BR>

<P>No matter what anyone says, the Department of Education will not just write checks to local<BR>
school boards. They will meddle in everything. I do not want that. <BR>
     Representative Pat Schroeder [CO-D] Congressional Record, September 27, 1979, Page<BR>
     26534.<BR>

<P>An integral part of the NEA design is to siphon ever more control of public education from the<BR>
grass roots to Washington, closer to its own powerful lobbying influence, farther from the<BR>
parents and taxpayers who elect the school boards and pay the bills.<BR>
     Senator John Ashbrook [R-OH], Congressional Record, September 27, 1979, Page<BR>
     26529.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibilities Act<BR>
Senate Bill 269 and its companion bill, H.R. 2202, provide classic examples of a case of the<BR>
cure being worse than the disease. Attempting to deal with the nations illegal immigration<BR>
problem, these bills create a greater problem by proposing the establishment of a national<BR>
database to verify the employment eligibility of every American worker. The National Center<BR>
for Home Education and Home School Legal Defense Association oppose all national tracking<BR>
systems and are working against those aspects of this legislation.<BR>

<P>A diverse coalition of more than fifty organizations has formed to oppose the identification and<BR>
tracking provisions in these bills. The National Center and HSLDA have signed a coalition letter<BR>
addressed to the United States Senate expressing unqualified opposition to anything resembling<BR>
a national worker identification card, national worker registry, or any other comprehensive<BR>
national database. The National Center also formed another coalition comprised of many pro-<BR>
family groups which has had a positive impact as well.<BR>

<P>In the Senate, the full Judiciary Committee mark up for S. 269 began on February 29, 1996.<BR>
The coalition hopes to split the bill in half, separating the legal and illegal immigration sections. <BR>
Senators Russell Feingold (D-WI) and Spencer Abraham (R-MI) are working with our coalition<BR>
to kill, by floor amendment, the national tracking registry. <BR>

<P>Knowing that the situation was grim, the National Center launched a surgical strike fax alert<BR>
on March 4 asking home schoolers to call members of the Judiciary Committee and urge support<BR>
of the Abraham/Feingold amendment. The amendment failed in the Judiciary Committee by a<BR>
9 to 9 vote. The split in the vote, however, indicates that the amendment will be successful on<BR>
the Senate floor.<BR>

<P>Meanwhile, Feingold and Abraham have introduced S. 1535, which removes the national<BR>
registry requirements, increases the penalties for illegal immigration, and boosts law<BR>
enforcement. It is expected to be voted on in the full Senate in mid-April.<BR>

<P>In the House, a floor vote on H.R. 2202 took place in the U.S. House of Representatives on<BR>
March 20. Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH) offered a floor amendment to kill the registry<BR>
portion of the House version of the bill. The National Center and Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association launched a nationwide alert to remove the onerous provisions of the bill which<BR>
would create an expanded national registry and require employers to call a 1-800-big-brother<BR>
number to seek approval before hiring someone. <BR>

<P>Although the Chabot amendment failed, the thousands of calls pouring into the House effectively<BR>
killed Representative Elton Galleglys (R-CA) amendment by a vote of 86 ayes to 331 nays<BR>
(14 members did not vote). The Gallegly amendment would have made the 1-800-big-brother<BR>
number mandatory. Also, the calls contributed to Lamar Smith, the sponsor of the bill, changing<BR>
the national registry provision from mandatory to voluntary just days before the vote.<BR>

<P>Action: Home schoolers and all concerned citizens need to immediately contact their U.S.<BR>
Senators and ask them to vote for the Abraham/Feingold amendment to eliminate all national<BR>
registry provisions to S. 269.<BR>

<P><B>PSAT Develops Home School Codes</B><BR>
For many years, home schoolers taking the PSAT have had difficulty filling in the section which<BR>
asks for the school code. PSAT has now established Home School Codes.<BR>

<P>HOME SCHOOL CODES<BR>
Home schooled students need to enter the 6-digit Home School code for their state in Section<BR>
6a on their answer sheets. For example, if there are home schooled students taking the test at<BR>
your school who reside in Georgia, tell them to enter the code 991199 in Section 6a and<BR>
Home School Georgia in Section 6b. Also the test supervisor will need to enter the<BR>
appropriate code in Section 4: Other Schools on the 1995 PSAT/NMSQT Supervisors Report.<BR>

<P><B>ACROSS THE STATES</B><BR>

<P>CALIFORNIA: CORPORAL PUNISHMENTIS IT A NO-NO? <BR>

<P>The number of Home School Legal Defense Association member families who are contacted by<BR>
social workers continues to rise. Contacts are based upon either anonymous or identified<BR>
individual complaints alleging that the families are abusing and/or neglecting their children. One<BR>
constant theme throughout the complaints is that the type of discipline the parents administer to<BR>
the children is abusive (i.e. spanking).<BR>

<P>Many people do not believe any child should be disciplined with corporal punishment. But<BR>
despite the fact that most social workers regularly tell parents they do not have a right to spank<BR>
their children, or that they can only spank their children with their hand, this is not the law in<BR>
California. <BR>

<P>The law provides that reasonable, age-appropriate spanking cannot of itself be considered abuse<BR>
or neglect of a child. There is nothing in the California statutes that prohibits a parent from<BR>
using an object, other than the hand, to administer the corporal punishment. <BR>

<P>It must be clearly stated, however, that any abuse to a child which occurs during administration<BR>
of corporal punishment will be presumed child abuse by the child protective industry. The<BR>
burden will be on the parent to demonstrate otherwise.<BR>

<P>In light of the above, here are a few suggestions advocated by child psychiatrists and<BR>
pediatricians for parents who use corporal punishment as one of the means of disciplining their<BR>
children:<BR>

<P>1.   Do not spank your children or anyone elses children in public or outside the confines<BR>
     of your home. The windows and doors of your home should be secured when<BR>
     administering corporal discipline. Spanking should be done in private.<BR>

<P>2.   Avoid spanking someone elses child unless you have clear written authority to do so.<BR>

<P>3.   Do not administer corporal discipline when angry. A spanking is most effective<BR>
     administered immediately after the childs offense.<BR>

<P>4.   Use corporal discipline only for clearly understood and intentional disobedience.<BR>

<P>5.   Clearly explain to the child why corporal discipline is being administered.<BR>

<P>6.   After the discipline, always affectionately express your love for your child. A verbal<BR>
     review of the offense and verbal reassurance of the parents unconditional love for the<BR>
     child should be conveyed.<BR>

<P>7.   Spanking should always be administered with regard for the childs age and development.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>School Districts Assert Authority<BR>
Public school districts continue to attempt to assert authority over private schools that they<BR>
simply do not have. For example, one school recently sent out to private/home schools an<BR>
Application for Exemption From Attendance at a Public School. The application required<BR>
pupil information, including name, address, date of birth, and grade; and parent or legal<BR>
guardian information.<BR>

<P>The cover letter requested the private/home school administrator to indicate what exemption the<BR>
parent/administrator is claiming, i.e., the tutorial exemption, the private school exemption, or<BR>
the independent study exemption. The application asked the parent to provide information<BR>
regarding the tutor, the private school, or the public school administering the independent study<BR>
program.<BR>

<P>It is true that California law does give public school districts the authority to verify that a child<BR>
not enrolled in public school meets one of the attendance exemptions. However, that verification<BR>
is to be initiated by a complaint that a parent or guardian does not have his child in a legal<BR>
exemption from public school attendance.<BR>

<P>Some school district officials view home schooling as legal only through the tutorial<BR>
exemptionwhich means instruction is done by a certified teacher. If the private school affidavit<BR>
lists six students or less, these districts presume it is a home school and send a letter<BR>
accompanied by a form for the parents to complete and return. <BR>

<P>In most cases, the public school does not know the names, ages, or number of children who are<BR>
of compulsory school age in the family. The form is simply a fishing expeditionwithout the<BR>
names and ages of the children, the public school does not have sufficient information to pursue<BR>
a truancy complaint.<BR>

<P>HSLDA continues to inform such school districts that the private schools will not respond to this<BR>
type of inquiry and that the form exceeds the authority of the school district as pronounced in<BR>
the California Education Code.<BR>

<P>Lucia Mar Unified School District Requests Proof of Certification<BR>
The Lucia Mar Unified School District, a school district in San Louis Obispo County, sent a<BR>
letter to all the small private schools that had filed private school affidavits indicating that the<BR>
only legal way to home school was under the exemption which requires the tutor to be a certified<BR>
teacher. The parents were told that if they did not send a copy of their teaching certificate to the<BR>
district by March 3, 1996, their private school affidavit would be referred to the School<BR>
Attendance Review Board (SARB). The implication of this threat is that the school district would<BR>
challenge their right to home school under the private school exemption. The school district<BR>
indicated that the letter was sent at the instruction of the State Department of Education. The<BR>
letter also urged parents to attend a meeting for the purpose of learning about the independent<BR>
study program the school district is planning to launch in September 1996. <BR>

<P>Michael Smith told HSLDA members not to attend the meeting and assured the parents that their<BR>
private school legally exempts their children from the requirement of being instructed in a public<BR>
school or tutored by a certified teacher. <BR>

<P>In addition, Vice President Smith forwarded a letter to the Assistant Superintendent informing<BR>
the school district of its incorrect interpretation of the law in California as it relates to home<BR>
schoolers. The letter advised the school district that the SARB did not have any authority over<BR>
private schools, only over students alleged to be truant. The students in attendance in the private<BR>
schools which received the letter are exempt from public school attendance. Therefore, the<BR>
SARB has no authority at all over the students enrolled and receiving instruction in the private<BR>
schools.<BR>

<P>The school district responded by letter to the families, cancelling the scheduled independent<BR>
study program meeting and apologizing for any misunderstanding the letter may have created.<BR>
However, there has been no indication whether the Lucia Mar Unified School District will turn<BR>
over the home educating families private school affidavits to the SARB. Stay tuned for further<BR>
developments.<BR>

<P>Los Angeles County Assesses Processing Fee<BR>
HSLDA has been informed by home schoolers in Los Angeles County that they have received<BR>
phone calls from the LA County Board of Education informing them that their private school<BR>
affidavits have not been properly filed because they failed to pay the $25.00 processing fee. The<BR>
school official informs the parents they are not legal and tells them where to send the<BR>
processing fee. <BR>

<P>HSLDA instructed our member families not to pay the processing fee and to forward their<BR>
affidavits directly to the Department of Education in Sacramento via certified mail with a return<BR>
receipt requested. Member families who filed their affidavit and received the return receipt need<BR>
not be concerned about receiving such a call. Simply inform any caller from the Los Angeles<BR>
County Board of Education that you have filed the affidavit with the Superintendent of Public<BR>
Instruction as required by the private school law (Ed. Code  48222) and you have a certified<BR>
mail return receipt as proof that it was received and properly filed with the State Board of<BR>
Education. <BR>

<P>There is nothing further you need to do. However, any member family who receives further<BR>
contact by telephone or letter should immediately contact the HSLDA legal department for<BR>
guidance.<BR>

<P>IOWA: FAMILY FIGHTS BACK AGAINST DHS<BR>

<P>Howard and Debbie Taylor are a typical Iowa home schooling family, with this difference:<BR>
Debbies mother is described by her whole family as paranoid, and Debbies sister is a public<BR>
school teacher. When Howard and Debbie spanked their three-year-old at a family gathering last<BR>
year, Debbies mother and sister went ballistic. They threatened to call social services<BR>
immediately and have the children taken away. Grandmothers have rights! Aunts have rights!<BR>
they shouted, as Howard and Debbie gathered up their children and fled (with the remains of<BR>
a birthday cake in their arms) from the home.<BR>

<P>One year later, those threats came true. Social workers appeared at the door demanding to see<BR>
the children. Debbie refused. The social worker went to court asking for an order to enter the<BR>
home and talk to the children. The judge, acting completely contrary to law, wrote out a court<BR>
order to seize the children and bring them to the courthouse. After hours of interrogation, the<BR>
social workers had blown the original allegations up into a wild tale of ritual bondage and<BR>
dangerous behavior. The court-appointed guardian ad litem described the parents as exhibiting<BR>
a Ruby Ridge mentality.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Scott Somerville flew in to assist local attorney<BR>
Ray Sullins at a hearing challenging the order removing the children. After a two-day trial<BR>
attended by over 120 spectators, DHS agreed to release the children and give the family an<BR>
opportunity to challenge the taped interview through expert testimony. Debbie Taylor fell to her<BR>
knees as her seven-year-old daughter ran through the courtroom door. My baby! My baby!<BR>
Debbie cried as she gathered her little girl into her arms.<BR>

<P>Iowas Department of Human Services blatantly disregarded the statutes when enforcing the<BR>
protective orders to remove the Taylor children from their home. Attorneys Sullins and<BR>
Somerville documented almost a dozen different procedural errors in this case. Given the lawless<BR>
acts of DHS, even though the Taylor children may be home, it is clear that this case is far from<BR>
over. Please pray that the Taylors traumatic experience will work out to change the whole Iowa<BR>
child abuse system.<BR>

<P>KENTUCKY: HOME VISITS REVISITED<BR>

<P>A letter from the pupil personnel direct for Caldwell County announced that she will be<BR>
conducting home visits during the months of March and April. The letter, sent to home<BR>
schoolers in the county who notified under the private school statue, instructed the parents to<BR>
prepare and produce a portfolio of each childs work, attendance records, student progress<BR>
reports and the curriculum for the subjects taught.<BR>

<P>The director of pupil personnel cited Kentucky Revised Statute 159.040 for the authority to<BR>
conduct the home visit and review the education records. Section 1590.040 reads as follows:<BR>

<P>     Attendance at private and parochial schools shall be kept by the authorities of<BR>
     such schools in a register provided by the state board for elementary and<BR>
     secondary education, and such school authorities shall make attendance and<BR>
     scholarship reports in the same manner as is required by law or by regulation of<BR>
     the state board for elementary and secondary education of public school officials.<BR>
     Such schools shall at all times be open to inspection by directors of pupil<BR>
     personnel and officials of the department of education.<BR>

<P>Michael Smith, Vice President of Home School Legal Defense Association, responded on behalf<BR>
of the families pointing out that the above code section does provide that private schools will<BR>
keep attendance records and scholarship reports in the same manner as required for public<BR>
schools, but that the statute does not require those reports to be available to public school<BR>
officials. <BR>

<P>Public school officials argue that because private schools are to be open to inspection, the<BR>
inspection must mean an inspection of the attendance and scholarship reports. This argument<BR>
does not hold water because the statute does not specify what is to be inspected. Additionally,<BR>
the request to view a portfolio of each childs work and the curriculum for the subjects taught<BR>
is not mentioned anywhere in the statute.<BR>

<P>The rule of law in situations like this one is that unless the legislature specifically provides<BR>
authority to a governmental agency or employee to perform a specific function, the authority is<BR>
reserved to the people. Since the Kentucky Statute does not specifically give authority to public<BR>
school officials to inspect attendance and scholarship reports, school officials cannot compel<BR>
private school officials to turn over for inspection the aforementioned reports.<BR>

<P>The Supreme Court of Kentucky has given guidance regarding the issue of governmental<BR>
interference in the affairs of private schools in the case of Kentucky State Board of Elementary<BR>
and Secondary Education v. Rudasill, 589 SW 2d 877. The Supreme Court found that the state<BR>
did have a compelling interest to see that children in Kentucky are educated to become good<BR>
citizens and that children be prepared to intelligently exercise the right of suffrage. However,<BR>
the states interest may not be enforced at the expense of conscience or at the expense of<BR>
diversity of the parents and their children.<BR>

<P>The Court ruled that the state had to use the least restrictive means available where private<BR>
schools and parents assert that state activity interfere with their freedom to direct the education<BR>
of the children. A home visit to inspect records clearly is not the least restrictive alternative<BR>
available to local school districts to ensure private schools meet the states compelling interest<BR>
in education.<BR>

<P>Additionally, private schools conducted in homes are protected by the Fourth Amendment to the<BR>
United States Constitution which protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures.<BR>
With few exceptions, entry into a home against the consent of the occupants can only be<BR>
accomplished by the issuance of a warrant based upon probable cause. <BR>

<P>HSLDA also informed the director of pupil personnel that the occupants of the homes did not<BR>
consent to home visits. Therefore, any attempt to enter the home without the consent of the<BR>
occupants would be considered a violation of the occupants civil rights. As of March 18, 1996,<BR>
none of the families who received the directors letter have been contacted by the district, nor<BR>
have any attempts been made to exercise home visits.<BR>

<P>
<P>MAINE: COMMISSIONERS LETTER CAUSES CONFUSION<BR>

<P>On December 14, 1995, Dr. Wayne L. Mowatt, Maine Commissioner of Education, directed<BR>
a letter to district superintendents regarding non-approved private schools. The letter stated, It<BR>
has come to my attention that an increasing number of students are enrolling in non-approved<BR>
private schools that are actually home schooling programs. <BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Scott Somerville wrote to Dr. Edwin N.<BR>
Kastuck of the Maine Department of Education asking for clarification, I am confused as to<BR>
what Dr. Mowatt means when he says something is actually a home schooling program.<BR>
Attorney Somervilles letter went on to explain that under Maine law, only individual families<BR>
are eligible to apply for equivalent instruction through home instruction, which Dr. Mowatts<BR>
office usually handles. Any families working together to educate their children in a cooperative<BR>
manner are excluded from applying under these regulations, since any regular instructional<BR>
program conducted for purposes of the compulsory attendance law which enrolls two or more<BR>
unrelated students is defined to be a school under chapter 130  1(C).<BR>

<P>The Maine Supreme Court has ruled the presence or absence of an objective third party makes<BR>
a critical difference under Maines education law, Blount v. Department of Educational and<BR>
Cultural Services, 551 A.2d 1377 (Me. 1988). Families who seek the benefit of such cooperative<BR>
schooling arrangements should not be precluded from using them just because Maines home<BR>
school regulations only apply to individual families.<BR>

<P>Private schools all over the country have found that home schoolers are eager to enroll in their<BR>
programs and benefit from their resources. It is important to note that Maines rules for<BR>
equivalent instruction programs define a school as any instructional program conducted for<BR>
purposes of compulsory attendance law which enrolls two or more unrelated students. [Rules,<BR>
 1(C), emphasis added.] These cooperative school arrangements clearly fall within the<BR>
definition of these rules.<BR>

<P>Maine home schools are well within their rights to choose a cooperative school arrangement, but<BR>
we can expect new challenges from state officials who prefer their own opinions over the<BR>
language of the law.<BR>

<P>
<P>NEW MEXICO: Phone Calls Kill H.B. 337<BR>

<P>In February, Home School Legal Defense Association sent out a legislative alert to its members<BR>
in New Mexico regarding House Bill 337, introduced by Barbara Casey of Rosewell. The<BR>
proposed legislation would have amended the home school law by striking the requirement that<BR>
home school teachers have a high school diploma and replacing it with the requirement that<BR>
home schooled students receive instruction in a manner that is substantially comparable to that<BR>
required . . . . for students in public school. Had this language been adopted, it would have<BR>
opened up the potential for home schools to be regulated by public schools.<BR>

<P>Phil Schultz, President of New Mexico Christian Home Educators, informed HSLDA that H.B.<BR>
337 did not get out of committee because the co-sponsors received enough telephone calls to<BR>
cause them to withdraw their support.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association members who responded to our alert are to be<BR>
congratulated: your time and effort were well invested. Telephone calls do make a difference.<BR>

<P>There is a very good possibility, however, that this legislation will be introduced again next<BR>
year, and we will have to go through the process once more. Should another telephone blitz be<BR>
necessary, we trust that home schooling families will have the same faithfulness to respond, to<BR>
make the telephone calls, to participate in democracy, and to protect their freedom and their<BR>
families.<BR>

<P>
<P>OHIO: SPREADING CONFUSION<BR>

<P>An article appeared in the December 1995 issue of the Ohio School Boards Association<BR>
newsletter which has caused concern in the home school community. This newsletter is read by<BR>
virtually every superintendent in the state of Ohio, and misinformation regarding the current<BR>
home school regulations could have a very detrimental affect on the working relationship<BR>
between many superintendents and home schoolers. <BR>

<P>Entitled, Staying Home: A Look at Home Education, the article was written by staff attorney<BR>
Adam C. Miller. The central problem with the analysis of the current home school requirements<BR>
revolves around preeminence given to the compulsory attendance law found in Ohio Revised<BR>
Code Ann.  3321.04(A)(2) over the home school regulations established by the State Board of<BR>
Education. <BR>

<P>The author fails to recognize, first, that the legislature authorized the State Board of Education<BR>
to draft regulations for home education. Second, the principle of law which governs in this<BR>
situation is that the specific always overrides the general. In other words, the Administrative<BR>
Code Regulations on home education are controlling in this situation (the specific guidelines),<BR>
not the Ohio Revised Code (the general discretionary authority of the superintendent). The very<BR>
purpose of the regulations was to bring uniform application to the excusal of home schooled<BR>
children from public school attendance by the public school superintendent.<BR>

<P>
<P>According to the article, superintendents are given a high degree of discretion in approving<BR>
home school programs. Again, the author draws this conclusion from his interpretation of the<BR>
Ohio Revised Code, which states that a child is excused from public school attendance if it is<BR>
demonstrated:<BR>

<P>     (2) That he is being instructed at home by a person qualified to teach the<BR>
     branches in which instruction is required, and such additional branches, as the<BR>
     advancement and needs of the child may, in the opinion of such superintendent,<BR>
     require. (emphasis added)<BR>

<P>Numerous inaccurate statements regarding the authority of the superintendent and what is<BR>
required of home educators follow as the article continues. <BR>

<P>If the superintendent is dissatisfied with the [curriculum] plan, he or she can require a<BR>
parentwithin 14 daysto provide more written information or to present additional information<BR>
at a conference. Contrary to the authors opinion, the curriculum information is submitted to<BR>
demonstrate that the required subjects are being taught, NOT FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE<BR>
SUPERINTENDENT. The authority given to the superintendent in the regulations is to review<BR>
materials submitted to make ensure the regulations are being complied with, not for evaluation.<BR>

<P>In the same vein, the author tells the superintendent that he or she has the authority to evaluate<BR>
the home education program to see if it meets the childs needs. The article states:<BR>

<P>     Clearly, the superintendent must conduct a reasonable inquiry to whether the<BR>
     child has any special needs and whether the plan for home education meets these<BR>
     needs. This can include, but is not limited to, special education, gifted education<BR>
     and remedial education.<BR>

<P>The State Board has already determined what information is required to satisfy the states<BR>
interest in education. That information is contained in the notification requirement. Nowhere in<BR>
the regulations is such broad authority given to the superintendent to evaluate and approve any<BR>
home education program. <BR>

<P>The article continues, Parents are encouraged to treat the code requirements as a minimum and<BR>
update the superintendent and staff regularly as to their childs progress and proficiency. This<BR>
issue was clearly addressed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction at the time the<BR>
regulations were enacted. In a memorandum by the Superintendent of Public Instruction<BR>
addressed to local superintendents the questions was raised, Are the requirements in Rule 3301-<BR>
34-02 just minimum standards that local districts can exceed? The answer was an emphatic<BR>
No. These are rules of the State Board that carry the same effect as law, and school districts<BR>
may not exceed these standards.<BR>

<P>The author asserts that each superintendent is able to draft his/her own policy regarding home<BR>
schoolingbut this is the very problem intended to be corrected by the State Board when the<BR>
regulations were drafted in 1989. The Administrative Regulations are the current law on home<BR>
schooling, not the local superintendent and/or school board.<BR>

<P>The author attempted to provide a summary of the regulation requirements for notification and<BR>
assessment, but again, he promulgated misinformation. He states that under the assessment<BR>
option, the childrens tests must be taken with the rest of the students in the district as<BR>
scheduled during the year. Any person who has carefully read the home school regulations<BR>
knows that standardized testing of home school students may be provided independent of the<BR>
school district as long as it is administered by a person duly authorized by the publisher of the<BR>
test.<BR>

<P>It is because this type of legal advice is provided to local school districtseven after seven years<BR>
of operating under the State Board of Educations regulationsthat home schoolers continue to<BR>
encounter many difficulties with school districts, even when they are actually in compliance with<BR>
the law.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>SOUTH DAKOTA SCORES TWO MAJOR VICTORIES!<BR>

<P>For years, South Dakota families and local school districts have battled over the requirement that<BR>
home schooled children be tested with the same standardized tests used in the public schools.<BR>
Many families object to this, wanting their children to be evaluated by means that measure what<BR>
their children have learned, not what the public school children have learned. These conflicts<BR>
came to a head two years ago, when home schoolers discovered that the most common school<BR>
district test, the MAT-7, had a number of questions that were really shocking to Christian<BR>
families.<BR>

<P>A number of Home School Legal Defense Association members refused to test their children<BR>
with the MAT-7 tests. In response, many of the school districts threaten the parents with court<BR>
action.<BR>

<P>With the consent of the test publisher, HSLDA carefully scrutinized the MAT-7 test questions<BR>
and found some of them to be heavily weighted against traditional moral values and in favor of<BR>
politically correct attitudes. HSLDA attorney Christopher Klicka was able to convince the<BR>
superintendents to hold off prosecution for that year, but the root problemthe wording of the<BR>
lawremained.<BR>

<P>HSLDA drafted language to change the law as it pertained to the testing requirements and<BR>
forwarded it to the South Dakota home school leaders. Aspects of the language were finally<BR>
incorporated into H.R. 1286 which improved South Dakotas testing requirements for home<BR>
school children in two significant ways. First, children may now be tested with any national<BR>
achievement test. And second, the legislation also ended the requirement that families have<BR>
children tested annually. Now, children are only required to be tested in the same grades that<BR>
public school children must be tested. <BR>

<P>By Gods grace, Governor William J. Janklow signed House Bill 1286 into law on March 4,<BR>
1996,. Families with significant objections to the MAT-7 should call HSLDA about testing this<BR>
spring. All families will be able to select any nationally standardized achievement tests starting<BR>
in the 1996-1997 school year.<BR>

<P>The other bill signed into law on March 4 was House Bill 1279, an act to provide additional<BR>
safeguards against false and malicious reports of abuse and neglect. This was an unusually well-<BR>
written and much-needed amendment to the law, which prohibited the Department of Social<BR>
Services from removing any portion of their records that would tend to prove, affirm,<BR>
corroborate, or support the innocence of the subject of a child abuse report without express<BR>
written authority of the subject of the child abuse report. In an entirely new section of the Code,<BR>
any subject of an unfounded report of child abuse or neglect who believes that the report was<BR>
made in bad faith or malicious intent may petition the court for the release of the records of the<BR>
investigation. This finally makes it possible for families who are maliciously hot-lined to defend<BR>
themselves.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VIRGINIA: S.B. 621 DEFEATED<BR>

<P>All Virginia Home School Legal Defense Association member families received a letter in late<BR>
February asking them to mobilize against Senate Bill 621. <BR>

<P>Virginia is unique in having the highest degree of protection for parents of any state in the<BR>
country. In 1995, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled that the Department of Social Services<BR>
may not identify an allegation of child abuse or neglect as founded without clear and<BR>
convincing evidence of abuse. Every other state permits families to be identified as abusive<BR>
with much less proofin fact, the reality in most states is that families are founded as abusive<BR>
on a mere suspicion of abuse with any evidence to support it.<BR>

<P>Senate Bill 621 was going to remove this protection for Virginia families. On February 8, 1996,<BR>
Senator Stolle amended in the following language: That standard of proof in determining<BR>
whether a report of abuse or neglect is founded shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.<BR>
This language would have nullified the Court of Appeals ruling that the proper standard should<BR>
be clear and convincing evidence. When it came to a vote, the senators split 20 to 20 on this<BR>
bill. Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer cast the deciding vote against parental rights.<BR>

<P>As usual, home schoolers responded with lightning speed to a threat to their freedoms. When<BR>
this bill reached the House committee, it was promptly killed. God deserves all the glory for<BR>
stopping this bill for without His protection, this bill would almost certainly have become law.<BR>

<P>
<P>Triennial School Census<BR>
Every three years, Home School Legal Defense Association is barraged with telephone calls<BR>
from Virginia home school parents who have just received the school census and are inquiring<BR>
whether they are mandated to participate. We advise our member families that participation in<BR>
the school census is voluntary and they may decide for themselves whether or not to take part.<BR>

<P>There are a number of reasons home schooling families may decide not to participate in the<BR>
school census. The primary reason, however, is tax dollars. The schools receive funding based<BR>
on the number of children in the district. Many home schoolers do not want their tax dollars to<BR>
go to the public school system and their only opportunity to voice their conscientious objection<BR>
comes once every three years, when they just say no to the school census.<BR>

<P>Of course, if tuition tax credit legislation is ever enacted, home schoolers will be relieved of this<BR>
double burden. Until that time, many Virginia families will no doubt continue to exercise their<BR>
legal option and refuse to participate in the school census.<BR>

<P>In summary, Home School Legal Defense Association does not advise any family to not<BR>
participate in the school census. We merely respond that participation is not required by law,<BR>
and explain to sincere religious families that non-participation provides one way to express their<BR>
religious objection to the religious vacuum of the public schools. Each family is left to decide<BR>
according to their own convictions.<BR>

<B>UNSUNG HEROES REVISITED</B><BR>
In the last issue of the Court Report we printed a letter from a mother who asked us to recognize<BR>
the other unsung hero of home educationthe fathers who lay down their lives for their families.<BR>

<P>Her honest account of the struggles her family is facing prompted an outpouring of love from<BR>
HSLDA members across the country. We have received letters and telephone calls from<BR>
members who were touched by the letter and wanted to communicate their support, empathy,<BR>
and encouragement to this family. Unfortunately, I cannot do that directly because the letter was<BR>
truly anonymous. The mother signed it name withheld, and the envelope did not bear a return<BR>
address.<BR>

<P>God has used this mothers letter and the response of HSLDA members to build our faith and<BR>
encourage us. We are privileged at HSLDA to be able to share in the joys and sorrows of many<BR>
of our member families. You share with us your childrens accomplishments, send us birth<BR>
announcements, and fondly bid us good-bye when your last child has graduated. But we also<BR>
hear from families who are struggling to survive. Sometimes the difficult circumstances involve<BR>
job loss, illness, or even the death of a mother, father, or child. And sometimes we hear from<BR>
families who arent survivingone parent has abandoned the family, leaving his or her spouse<BR>
and children hurting and alone.<BR>

<P>As HSLDA members have reached out to express love and encouragement to this unknown<BR>
family, we have been privileged to hear their stories. Moms and dads who have called or written<BR>
have struggled through some very dark days. Some are still struggling. Yet they offer their<BR>
testimonies of what God has done and is doing for them. Through His power and grace they are<BR>
overcoming!<BR>

<P>Even though we cannot communicate directly with this family, we can uphold them in<BR>
prayerfaithfully interceding for them and for other home schooling families across our nation<BR>
who face difficult circumstances.<BR>
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in<BR>
mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints Ephesians 6:18.<BR>

<P>
<P>Confidential to Name Withheld,<BR>
If you would like to contact us, we would be delighted to forward to you the letters we have<BR>
received for you.<BR>

<B>PRAYER &amp; PRAISE</B><BR>

<P>Be anxious for nothing but in everything let your requests be made know to God. And the peace<BR>
of God that transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through Christ<BR>
Jesus.                                         Phillipians 4:6-7<BR>

<P>Praise God for the excellent turnout at the recent parental rights rally in Indiana, and pray that<BR>
God would continue to use the home school families in that state to reach their legislators with<BR>
the message of parental rights. House Bill 1346, a parental rights bill, was passed, but the<BR>
section declaring parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their child was<BR>
deleted. Praise God that freedom has been strengthened, and pray for Indiana home schoolers<BR>
as they seek to continue this battle.<BR>

<P>The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibilities Act, which seeks to establish a national<BR>
database, passed the House and is being considered by the Senate. Senators Russell Feingold (D-<BR>
WI) and Spencer Abraham (R-MI) have introduced an amendment to eliminate all national<BR>
registry provisions to this bill. <BR>

<P>The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act now has 130 co-sponsors in the House and 10 in<BR>
the Senate. Please pray that this legislation would continue to move forward.<BR>

<P>Please pray for the families, lawyers, and judges involved in our active litigation:<BR>

<P> The Jones family in Arkansas is unable to pay the state-required testing fee of $35.00 per test,<BR>
and they are seeking to declare that requirement in violation of their fundamental parental and<BR>
religious liberties.<BR>

<P> The Kennedy family in California has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the department of<BR>
social servicies, who entered their home and interrogated and examined their children without<BR>
a search warrant.<BR>

<P> A Maryland home-schooling mother, Cheryl Battles, is being criminally prosecuted for her<BR>
refusal to sign the state assurance of consent form, which violates her religious beliefs.<BR>

<P> The C. Family in Virginia has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the department of social<BR>
services, who, in cooperation with the domestic relations court clerk and intake officer, issued<BR>
bogus subpoenas to force Mr. and Mrs. C. to cooperate with their child abuse investigation.<BR>

<P>The Taylor family in Iowa is battling the department of human services over allegations of child<BR>
abuse. <BR>

<P>Praise the Lord for legislative victories in several states:<BR>

<P> In New Mexico, home schoolers launched a phone blitz against House Bill 337, which would<BR>
have opened up the potential for home schools to be regulated by public schools. As a result of<BR>
the telephone calls, the bill was killed in committee.<BR>

<P> Two good bills were signed into law in South Dakota. House Bill 1286 improves the testing<BR>
requirements for home school children, and House Bill 1279 provides additional safeguards<BR>
against false and malicious reports of child abuse and neglect.<BR>

<P> In Virginia, which is the state with the highest protection for parents against false allegations<BR>
of child abuse, home schoolers mobilized to defeat Senate Bill 621, which would have removed<BR>
this high level of parental rights protection.<BR>

<P>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his<BR>
power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout<BR>
all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.      Ephesians 3:20-21<BR>

<B>LITIGATION REPORT: </B>HOW OUR CASES ARE STACKING UP<BR>

<P>ARKANSAS<BR>
Rudolph &amp; Jolynn Jones v. State Department of Education  A civil rights lawsuit has been<BR>
filed on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Jones who are home schooling four children. Arkansas law<BR>
requires home-schooled children to take an annual standardized achievement test and to<BR>
reimburse the state a fee of $35.00 per test. Mr. Jones has been injured and reinjured on the job<BR>
within the last few years and cannot afford to pay the requisite fee. An inability to pay the fee<BR>
would result in the revocation of his familys legal home school status.<BR>

<P>Both sides have asked the judge to rule on the case without the necessity of a trial. Home School<BR>
Legal Defense Association contends that the Arkansas reimbursement statute violates the Jones<BR>
familys fundamental right to direct the education of their children when coupled with their right<BR>
to the free exercise of religion. We argue that the state cannot show a compelling interest in the<BR>
fee sufficient to justify such a law. The State Department of Education, on the other hand,<BR>
argues first that Mr. and Mrs. Jones are not indigent, but can afford to pay the testing fee.<BR>
Second, they argue that even if the Joneses are indigent, there is no such thing as the<BR>
fundamental right to home educate children, so the state must only show that there is a rational<BR>
basis for the law, namely, the recoupment of expenses. <BR>

<P>A decision from the court is imminent since the trial is set for May 13, 1996. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>CALIFORNIA<BR>
Kennedy v. Aluzri, et al.  This civil rights lawsuit stems from the warrantless entry into the<BR>
home of Robert and Maria Kennedy for inspection of the house, and interrogation and physical<BR>
examination of the children. The Kennedys would later learn that this unlawful conduct was<BR>
precipitated by an anonymous caller reporting that Mrs. Kennedy left her children in the<BR>
backyard unsupervised.<BR>

<P>The Los Angeles County Department of Social Services filed a motion to dismiss the complaint<BR>
on the ground that their social worker is entitled to immunity from such claims. HSLDA<BR>
responded to the motion by arguing that the defendant is entitled to assert only qualified<BR>
immunity, which does not protect a government official from claims for violation of clearly<BR>
established law. We assert that the law governing these circumstances is clear, that absent an<BR>
exigent circumstance, the Fourth Amendment demands a search warrant prior to the invasion<BR>
of a private home. The parties await the courts decision.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>ILLINOIS<BR>
Children &amp; Family Services v. Mrs. B.  Following a hearing before an administrative law<BR>
judge in Springfield, Illinois, the finding of child abuse against Mrs. B will be expunged from<BR>
the record. The finding stemmed from a cut beneath the eye of Mrs. Bs 6-year old daughter.<BR>
The cut required stitches at the local emergency room. The incident occurred when Mrs. B was<BR>
walking into the playroom. She stepped on a bucket the children had promised to pick up. Mrs.<BR>
B picked up the bucket and threw it against the wall in anger. Mrs. B did not intend to throw<BR>
the bucket at a child, nor did she even see her children when she threw it. Nevertheless, the<BR>
bucket bounced off the wall and hit her daughter in the face, injuring the child. The judge<BR>
concluded that the injury to Mrs. Bs daughter was by accident and that Mrs. B was not guilty<BR>
of abuse, nor had she created a real and significant danger of physical injury to the child. All<BR>
findings were expunged.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>MARYLAND<BR>
State v. Cheryl Battles  This mother of a kindergartner with sincerely held religious beliefs<BR>
that she should teach her child at home is being criminally prosecuted for her refusal to sign the<BR>
Maryland assurance of consent home school form. According to Mrs. Battles, consenting to be<BR>
under the jurisdiction of the local school district would violate her Christian faith because the<BR>
public schools are atheistic and require education that denies the absolute truths contained in<BR>
Scripture. Mrs. Battles does not object to demonstrating that she is in compliance with the<BR>
compulsory attendance statutes requirement that she provide a regular and thorough education.<BR>
A standardized test administered to the child indicates that the her progress is considerably<BR>
advanced for her age. The trial is presently scheduled for April 9, 1996.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>OHIO<BR>
Children Family Services Board v. Family of V.  The Ashtabula County Juvenile Court was<BR>
the scene of one of the most bizarre hearings in which HSLDA has been involved. Fourteen-year<BR>
old and four-year old sons were removed from this members home without notice by order of<BR>
the court. HSLDA appeared on the mothers behalf two days later to persuade the court that<BR>
there was not probable cause to justify the immediate removal of these children. <BR>

<P>What made the case so odd was the fact that the individuals alleging educational neglect and<BR>
physical abuse by the mother were three older children, ages 15, 18, and 20, who had not been<BR>
in the home for more than nine months. All three of these children claimed to have been<BR>
witches, the two youngest claimed to have been sexually abused by their father and have been<BR>
in psychological counselling for several years. Now they deny their activity in the occult and<BR>
recant on their allegations against their father. Yet it is based on their testimony that the court<BR>
removed the two younger boys.<BR>

<P>Following a seven hour hearing, the court dismissed the allegations of educational neglect, but<BR>
ordered the boys to be placed into the custody of Mrs. Vs sister, an aunt with whom the boys<BR>
have a good relationship. About three weeks later, however, the boys were placed in foster care<BR>
in order to insure their continued education. The hearing on the allegations of physical abuse is<BR>
set to begin March 19, 1996. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>RHODE ISLAND<BR>
State v. Thomas &amp; Kathleen SanBento  These parents of a 10-year old daughter and 8-year<BR>
old son are being criminally prosecuted for failure to comply with the states compulsory<BR>
attendance statute. The truth is that the SanBentos have been educating their children since the<BR>
beginning of the 95-96 school year and requested approval from the Lincoln School Committee<BR>
in September. The SanBento curriculum was not approved by the school committee, but HSLDA<BR>
had been attempting to resolve the differences when Mr. and Mrs. SanBentos were served with<BR>
criminal summonses.<BR>

<P>In the second week of March 1996, the Lincoln School Committee approved the SanBento<BR>
curriculum. The criminal actions should now be dismissed. Nevertheless, the school<BR>
superintendent continues to insist upon the SanBento children taking the Metropolitan<BR>
Achievement Test, as well as the state mandated written evaluation assessment test each year.<BR>
We believe the requirement of both of these tests to be beyond the terms of a written agreement<BR>
between the SanBentos and the superintendent, so we are working to resolve this dispute.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VIRGINIA<BR>
Mr. and Mrs. Daniel C. v. Roarke-Ruiz, et al.  Though we previously reported that this civil<BR>
rights lawsuit against the Pittsylvania County Department of Social Services (DSS) and<BR>
Pittsylvania County court clerks had been settled, DSS refuses to participate in the settlement.<BR>
This lawsuit is the result of an effort by the DSS, with the cooperation of the domestic and<BR>
relations court clerk and intake officer, to issue bogus subpoenas to obtain the cooperation of<BR>
Mr. and Mrs. C with the departments child abuse investigation.<BR>

<P>On October 16, 1995, a uniformed officer from the sheriffs department delivered three<BR>
subpoenas to the Cs home demanding they appear with three of their children at the district<BR>
court office supervising child abuse complaints. The officer advised them that he would obtain<BR>
a warrant for their arrest if they refused to comply with the subpoenas. When we obtained a<BR>
copy of the subpoenas, we recognized that they were fraudulent because there was no underlying<BR>
court proceeding or legal authorization of any kind. A civil rights lawsuit has been filed and<BR>
settled between all defendants other than DSS. The case will now proceed against them for their<BR>
violation of procedural due process.<BR>

<B>FROM THE MOUTHS OF BABES, PART II</B><BR>
Seven-year-old Tyler Reed knows about the presidents of the United States. He can list them in<BR>
order and he knows lots of interesting facts about the men and their presidencies.<BR>

<P>On the Wednesday afternoon that the FebruaryMarch 1996 issue of the Home School Court<BR>
Report arrived at the Reed home, Cheryl, Tylers mom, sat down to read him the Presidents<BR>
Page column.* We were excited, Cheryl reported, because you dont see too many things<BR>
written about past presidents. I started reading the article to him and he stopped me. Mom, that<BR>
doesnt sound right. I dont think he was assassinated in 1902. We got out our book on the<BR>
presidents and it said that McKinley was in his second term and he was assassinated in<BR>
September 1901.<BR>

<P>Tyler Reed is right. William McKinley was first elected president in 1896 and reelected in 1900.<BR>
He was shot on September 6 and died eight days later on September 14, 1901.<BR>

<B>PRESIDENTS PAGE:</B> OLD STORIES TELL THE PRICE OF FREEDOM<BR>
The Old Testament records that eventually there arose a Pharaoh who knew not Joseph. Under<BR>
the hand of this leader who did not know his nations history, the Israelites were cruelly<BR>
oppressed.<BR>

<P>In Deuteronomy 11:2-3, Moses reminded Israel that their children were not the ones who saw<BR>
and experienced the discipline of the Lord your God: His majesty, His mighty hand, His<BR>
outstretched arm; the signs He performed and the things He did in the heart of Egypt.<BR>

<P>In order that future generations would know and remember this important history, God told the<BR>
Israelites to fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your<BR>
hands and bind them on your foreheads. Teach them to your children, talking about them when<BR>
you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up<BR>
(Deut. 11:18-19).<BR>

<P>Our enemies, like Pharaoh, forget. We forget. But our children, who have never heard our<BR>
history, do not have an opportunity to remember.<BR>

<P>Two years ago, one of the most exciting victories ever experienced in the home schooling<BR>
community occurred when we saw a million telephone calls used by God to deliver us from<BR>
national teacher certification in H.R. 6. Now, in 1996, when I speak at home schooling<BR>
conventions, almost a third of those in attendance have never heard of H.R. 6. <BR>

<P>There are hundreds of thousands of home schooling parents who have no memory of the<BR>
Bismarck Tea Party in 1989. Home school leaders from 11 states flew to Bismarck to stand in<BR>
solidarity with the home schoolers there in an attempt to embarrass North Dakota into repealing<BR>
its teacher certification law. <BR>

<P>We certainly have enough fights today to keep all of us on our toes. But we cannot afford to<BR>
forget the early fights for the freedom of our home schools. We need to tell and remember the<BR>
stories, like:<BR>

<P>Eight-year-old Carey Dagley in North Dakota who was subpoenaed to testify against her<BR>
parents. She had to claim the Fifth Amendment.<BR>

<P>Robin Deigle of Ohio who was delivered from a judge who announced his intention to rule<BR>
against her before her case was ever begun.<BR>

<P>Helene Richards, the first of our Fourth Amendment heroes, who stood in her doorway and<BR>
told a social worker she couldnt enter her home unless she had a warrant.<BR>

<P>The Katy 5five families near Houston who ignited the fire for Texas home schooling<BR>
freedom by standing tall against a criminal prosecution.<BR>

<P>Yes, new home schooling parents need to know and remember these stories. But even more<BR>
important is our duty to tell the stories of freedom to our children.<BR>

<P>After two decades of political involvement, I am convinced that the best political activists are<BR>
people who have had to personally fight for their freedom. Since home schoolers have had to<BR>
engage in hand-to-hand political combat, we have become the single most effective group of pro-<BR>
family activists in the nation. <BR>

<P>Had the National Education Association had any idea of what a vibrant political force they were<BR>
helping to create, they would have done well to urge states to quickly liberalize all laws<BR>
regulating home schooling. Instead, they resisted. We won. And in the process, the NEAs<BR>
resistance helped to create Americas best grassroots lobbying team.<BR>

<P>Our children need to know these things if we want them to be freedom fighters. They need to<BR>
be involved in our battles of today. They should be writing letters to their congressmen and state<BR>
legislators. They should do these things, not only for the effect such letters have today, but also<BR>
because their personal experience in fighting for freedom will change them for a lifetime.<BR>

<P>I firmly believe that the job of this generation is to hold on to a semblance of freedomalmost<BR>
by our fingernailsuntil the army we are raising is ready to take back our nation and restore<BR>
the constitutional principles upon which we were founded.<BR>

<P>These are grand dreams and glorious possibilities, none of which will happen if we dont tell<BR>
our children and the families who are just beginning to home school about the battles and<BR>
victories of the past.<BR>

<P>Old soldiers love to tell battle stories. New soldiers need to hear them so they know the price<BR>
of freedom.<BR>
