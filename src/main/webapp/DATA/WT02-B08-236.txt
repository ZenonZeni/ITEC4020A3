	Terence Armstrong, who has died aged 75, was Britain's leading
expert on the Russian Arctic, whose support of Cambridge's Scott Polar
Research Institute for more than 36 years contributed largely to the
department's reputation as a centre of excellence.<p>

	Educated at Winchester and Magdalene College, Cambridge, he took
first class honours in French and Russian, and was supervised by that
legendary Russian teacher Dr (now Dame) Elizabeth Hill.  In 1940
Armstrong joined the Army Intelligence Corps. serving in North Africa,
Italy and Holland - he was parachuted into Arnhem and wounded -
Germany and Norway.<p>

	Postwar he was the Scott Institute's first research fellow in
Soviet Arctic studies, a post established on the reasoning that the
Russians knew more about the Arctic than anyone else.  Armstrong
covered the development of the Soviet north at a time when hard facts
about the area were few.  Thus did the linguist metamorphose into a
geographer.  He chose the economic development of the Soviet northern
sea route - the old Northeast Passage - for his 1952 thesis, before
examining the economic effects of sea ice on the route and carrying out
studies for the Royal Navy Scientific Survey.  In 1954 he joined the
maiden voyage of <i>HMCS Labrador</i> through the ice-packed 
North-west Passage.  His observations led to an ice atlas, <i>Sea ice 
north of the USSR</i> (1958) a model for similar atlases covering 
Arctic and Antarctic waters.<p>

	In 1957, following the incorporation of the institute into the
university, Armstrong was appointed an assistant director of research. 
Despite the additional duties he wrote <i>Russian settlement in the 
North</i> (1965), contributed to the <i>Illustrated glossary of snow and 
ice</i> (1966), and travelled throughout the Canadian north and the 
Soviet Arctic.  His fluent Russian established contacts which led to 
exchange agreements with academies and libraries.  The polar 
institute's collection of Russian language material is today one of the 
most comprehensive in the world.<p>

	A 1970-72 sabbatical at the University of Alaska led to seminars
on cross cultural education with representatives of the indigenous
northern peoples.  In a collaborative publication, <i>The circumpolar
north</i>, Armstrong reviewed the Arctic and sub-Arctic's political and
economic geography.  He compiled a Unesco report on the Arctic's
cultural and economic problems.<p>

	In 1975 the polar institute initiated a polar studies M Phil.  Its
success owed much to Armstrong's skills and charismatic, engaging
personality.  In 1976 he was awarded an ad hominem readership in
Arctic studies.<p>

	He was a founder fellow of Clare Hall graduate college, and for 25
years was joint honorary secretary of the Hakluyt Society, for whom he
edited an edition of Yermak's voyages (1975).  He was the Glaciological
Society's treasurer from 1965-1970; academic honours included the
Royal Geographical Society's Victoria medal.<p> 

	After retirement in 1983, he was a visiting professor at Trent
University, Ontario, and chaired the Natural Environment Research
Council's working group on Arctic science policy.  He also travelled,
walked, and made music (he was an accomplished oboe player).  With
his wife Iris he contributed greatly to village life in Harston, where he
was churchwarden and treasurer for many years, and to entertaining a
wide circle of friends.  He is survived also by two sons and two
daughters.<p>
