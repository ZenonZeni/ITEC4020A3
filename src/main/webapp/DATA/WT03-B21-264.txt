The international energy efficiency community suffers from a lack of systematic sharing of experience and best practices among
energy efficiency practitioners, and of clear information about how best to apply sound energy efficiency principles. There is a
need to share knowledge about successes or failures of energy efficiency policies, investment opportunities, and alternative
financing approaches. WEEA was created in 1993 to fill this void by facilitating networking and information exchange to
strengthen the capacities of governmental and private institutions with expertise in energy efficiency and renewable energy. As
of June 1995 WEEA was working with over one hundred institutions worldwide.

WEEA is committed to developing systems, both electronic and conventional, to assist practitioners in the field solve problems
encountered in implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. 

<DD>WEEA begins from the assumption that the most critical component of a network is the body of participating institutions. To
this end, WEEA is engaged in a continuous effort to catalogue and profile institutions interested in energy efficiency worldwide.
The third edition of the International Directory of Energy Efficiency Institutions is currently being revised and expanded to cover
the more than one-thousand institutions worldwide with whom WEEA has made contact. 

<DD>Electronic systems can, however, enhance the effectiveness and facilitate collaboration among an established network. WEEA
takes advantage of electronic conferencing and electronic access to reports and other information to serve the needs of this
community.

<FONT SIZE=6>WEEA has outlined the following steps to assist energy efficiency practitioners: </FONT><BR>

<DD><LI>     maintain a database of on-going sustainable energy projects worldwide to provide a realistic idea of the size of the
     market for energy efficiency; 
  <DD><LI>   improve access to existing reports and databases critical to practitioners and financiers in these fields; 
 <DD><LI>    establish electronic links among energy efficiency institutions and experts to facilitate problem solving; 
  <DD><LI>   organize WEEA working groups to discuss optimum approaches to problem solving using databases, reports and
     networking. 

<DD>The electronic portion of the WEEA information system is designed around a site on the Internet, or more specifically, the
World Wide Web. The system has been designed recognizing limitations in access to the Internet and limitations in bandwidth
in developing countries. The information will be mirrored on a gopher and FTP site, and plans are underway to produce
CD-ROMs for distribution to those without Internet access. The system is designed for an inexperienced user of electronic
resources and allows quick access to needed information. 

<DD>A portion of the information on this server is maintained in-house, but the majority of the information accessible has been
achieved through identifying existing electronic information resources and facilitating access to these sites. The Internet Energy
and Environment Sampler is WEEA's catalogue of available information resources. A print version and an electronic version
are available. 

<DD>As more institutions take advantage of the growing effectiveness of the Internet, the system will continue to grow to serve an
ever larger community. For more information on this system, please contact the World Energy Efficiency Association.
