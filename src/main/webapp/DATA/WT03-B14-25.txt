VOLVO'S WITHDRAWAL PRECIPITATES
DEMISE OF TELEGUIDE NETWORK

  The plan to shut down Sweden's Teleguide service eliminates
a medium for transmitting routing information to motorists.
The videotext network was scheduled to offer a range of
information services, including a point-to-point route
planning system configured by Volvo AB (see sister
publication, Inside IVHS, Sept. 28, 1992).

  Stockholm-based Teleguide, a consortium consisting of
Swedish Telecom, IBM Sweden and Esselte, disclosed earlier
this month that all services would be terminated April 1. The
fledgling service began operations only last March.

           Routing Never Gets Off the Ground

  Volvo's routing service never made it out of the starting
gate. While tests of the service were run on the videotext
network for two or three months, the routing feature was
never formally introduced as a Teleguide service. Volvo had
been planning to offer the routing service over Teleguide as
part of a customer service package that included maintenance
and car parts information.

  While Volvo officials involved in the project expressed
disappointment that Teleguide services would be terminated
this spring, the Swedish automaker may have contributed to
the demise of the information service by delaying or
effectively cancelling its introduction of services over the
videotext network. Volvo decided in December not to offer its
planned Teleguide services.

  "Volvo's decision was important for all the Teleguide
products. When Volvo got out, this was the 'last piece of the
coffin,'" says Thomas Rickne, marketing director of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and transport planning
at Cyberlogik AB in Gothenburg, Sweden. Cyberlogik was the
supplier of map data and technical support for Volvo's route
planning service. Cyberlogik, in turn, used a routing
algorithm supplied by Distribution Planning Software (DPS) in
Halesowen, West Midlands in the United Kingdom. DPS
manufactures the LogiX product line of routing, scheduling
and fleet management software.

  Volvo's main contribution to the routing service had
focused on the development of the user interface for the
Teleguide terminals. Unlike routing software packages
designed to run on PCs, the Teleguide system was not designed
to display maps of the recommended routes. Rather, it
displayed the point-to-point driving directions as text on
dedicated terminals. Volvo's routing service would have
provided route recommendations for trips on the major highway
and motorway networks. Map data used in the system did not
include street level information, which would obviously
prevent the system from calculating routes to specific sites
within cities.

                     Coming Up Short

  In explaining Volvo's decision to pull out of the Teleguide
project, Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at
the automaker's facilities in Gothenburg, notes that the
22,000 users currently on the network fall short of the
80,000 that had been expected to have terminals in their
homes and offices by now.

  What really doomed the service, however, was not the lower
than expected number of users, but a lack of willing
investors, says Olle Elioth, managing director at Teleguide.
"We tried to find other investors. We were not successful in
that," says Elioth.

  Teleguide officials announced the plan to cease operations
after Swedish Telecom and Esselte, an office equipment and
software company, decided to withdraw from the project.
Esselte, which has struggled for the past few years, decided
that Teleguide didn't fit into the recently restructured
company, says Elioth.

  Swedish Telecom's decision to pull out of Teleguide
reflects its move out of videotext services altogether.
"They're tired of videotext," says Elioth, adding that
Swedish Telecom plans to shut down its business-to-business
videotext service on Jan. 1, 1994. It has about the same
number of users as Teleguide. "There will be no public
videotext service in Sweden from 1994 onwards," he says.

  Elioth expresses disappointment about the decision to close
the Teleguide information service: "We'll not see anything of
this kind in Sweden this side of the year 2000," he says.

  The three primary investors collectively lost 325 million
Swedish kronor ($43.5 million) on the Teleguide project,
according to Elioth.

  For Volvo, its troubles with Teleguide stemmed from higher
than expected development costs. Sources say Volvo had
trouble developing applications for the videotext
environment. "They were forced to do a lot of basic
programming," says Cyberlogik's Rickne, who adds that the
lack of good software support significantly inflated
development costs. RDS-TMC Tests Set For Dynaguide In
Southern Norway

  While U.S. transportation policy officials continue to
debate the data transmission capabilities of RDS-TMC, their
counterparts in Europe are conducting additional tests of the
system's ability to broadcast traffic information. In the
latest move, transportation officials in Norway are planning
the country's first RDS-TMC (radio data system-traffic
message channel) tests. The Public Roads Administration is
laying the groundwork for a TMC test in Norway's southeastern
corner, not far from Oslo.

  Initial plans call for using the Dynaguide TMC units
developed by Sweden's Volvo AB. Dynaguide, unlike most other
TMC designs, displays traffic information graphically, rather
than displaying TMC text messages.

  "The plan is to test 10 of the Dynaguide units this summer
to see if RDS receivers can work with Dynaguide," says Finn
Berg, project manager for the traffic information project for
the Public Roads Administration in Tonsberg, Norway.

      Volvo Wraps Up First Round of Dynaguide Tests

  Volvo is concluding an initial round of tests in
Gothenburg, Sweden of the first 100 or so Dynaguides built.
Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at the Swedish
automaker, says Volvo engineers are compiling information
about a six week evaluation of the Dynaguide units. The tests
-- which involved 70 drivers -- got underway in the first
week of December. Hellaker says response to units has been
"very good."

  Dynaguide hardware and software were developed for Volvo by
MMI Systems AS in Sandefjord, Norway. Erik Hovland, an MMI
official, says a handful of the units originally built for
Volvo's tests in Gothenburg could be used for the planned
project in Norway. "We've not decided how many units would be
used," he says. Cost estimates for the project are also not
available.

  The scope of the project should become clearer as Hovland
completes a study about RDS-TMC for the Norwegian
authorities. He says it should be finished by the first of
March. The official name of the project is "traffic
information and control -- year 2000."

  While Berg acknowledges that the government will most
likely foot the bill for the project, he declines to divulge
how much money has been budgeted for the initiative. Berg and
Hovland recently met with the Road Directorate in Oslo to
inform the national office about the project. Presumably,
funding approvals were sought as well.

          Lillehammer Olympics Could Benefit

  Assuming the project in Tonsberg -- a popular weekend
destination for Oslo residents in the summer -- is
successful, the RDS-TMC network could be expanded north to
Lillehammer in time for the winter Olympics next February. "I
think the Roads Administration is very interested to see the
expansion of this project up to the Lillehammer area," says
Hovland, who cautions that such planning is "very
preliminary."

  For the Tonsberg area tests, the planning for which is more
advanced, Hovland says the ALERT-C message protocol used in
the Dynaguide tests in Gothenburg would also be used in
Norway. Modifications recently made to ALERT-C by the
European Broadcasting Union would not be incorporated into
the planned Norway tests, Hovland says. Traffic messages,
however, would have to be translated from Swedish into
Norwegian.

  Dynaguide is an in-vehicle information system that converts
TMC text messages into visual symbols displayed on a
digitized roadway map. The unit consists of a 5" color LCD
that interfaces to a conventional RDS radio.

  Early planning for the Norway project has focused on the
Dynaguide unit. But the Public Roads Administration is also
considering other text-based TMC devices. "We're looking at
both text and graphical displays," says Berg.

  As the manufacturer of Dynaguide, MMI's Hovland is
obviously keen to feature Dynaguide in the test. "As far as I
know, no text-based TMC receivers are under consideration,"
says Hovland, who first approached Berg about establishing
the Oslo area RDS-TMC project.

  While Volvo is not directly involved in the project, a
delegation of Norwegian project officials is scheduled to
visit the automaker's R&D facilities in Gothenburg in mid
March. The trip is designed to familiarize the Norwegian
officials with operation of the TMC network.

  In addition to using similarly configured in-vehicle units,
the Norwegian project will use the same TMC transmission
gear, which is supplied by Sweden-based Teli. "We have to use
equipment we know for the Norway project," says Hovland.
Negotiations are currently underway with NRK, the Norwegian
broadcasting company, and a local radio station, about
transmitting the TMC messages over their subcarriers, says
Berg.

             PC Version Also Available

  Along with the portable units, project officials in Norway
are interested in testing stationary TMC units that feature
the same graphical interface as the Dynaguide design. Hovland
says the PC version of Dynaguide could be installed in hotel
lobbies, gas stations and ferry terminals. "It's already
developed," he says.

JAPAN POLICE AGENCY ADVANCES
IVHS EFFORTS OUTSIDE OF VICS

by Robert L. French
  While Japan's VICS program may be stuck in the mud, two
IVHS initiatives associated with the country's police agency
appear to be making headway independent of the cooperative
program. The Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
(JTMTA), an industry organization that operates under
National Police Agency (NPA) auspices, has helped develop a
real-time traffic information service and a new infrared (IR)
vehicle detector.

  Rather than challenging the legitimacy of VICS (vehicle
information communication system), the JTMTA claims the two
initiatives could spur VICS officials to get their project
going. But industry observers note that the new traffic info
system, called ATISS for advanced traffic information supply
service, essentially serves some of the same functions as
VICS aims to.

  VICS has been moving at a slower pace than RACS and AMTICS,
the competing predecessor projects that were more or less
subsumed by VICS in 1991. The Ministry of Post &
Telecommunications -- which is the equivalent of the Federal
Communications Commission in the U.S. -- practically forced
RACS and AMTICS participants to join the VICS project, say
sources.

  The RACS (Road Automobile Communication System) project of
the Ministry of Construction (MC) and the AMTICS (Advanced
Mobile Traffic Information Communication System) project of
the NPA were vigorously pursuing independent traffic
information and communication infrastructures to service
essentially identical in-vehicle navigation and information
systems. RACS and AMTICS underwent several stages of
experimentation between 1986 and their consolidation in 1991.

  The most visible VICS activity in recent months has been
the preparation for a VICS demonstration experiment,
according to the recent issue of the VICS Newsletter. The
VICS demo is scheduled to be in operation in Tokyo later this
year.

           A New Traffic Information Service

  In the meantime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,
in conjunction with JTMTA, has spent two years developing
ATISS to make graphic traffic information available in real-
time to terminals -- i.e., computers, fax machines, TVs, --
in homes or offices via public switched telephone networks or
CATV networks. ATISS may also service in-vehicle units via
mobile telephone networks. Computers and in-vehicle terminals
may use the ATISS information in conjunction with digital
road maps stored on CD-ROM.

  Traffic information to be supplied by ATISS is essentially
the same as that originally planned for AMTICS, but with the
addition of current travel time for selected road links. An
ATISS operating company owned jointly by the Tokyo metropolitan
government and private industry will be started in June 1993 to
provide traffic information, for a fee, within the Tokyo
metropolitan area. The company will maintain an ATISS traffic
information database using data from the traffic control center
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and will interface
with the communications media. Commercial operation of ATISS is
expected to commence after two years of experimental operation
involving up to 4,000 terminals Officials are planning a similar
venture for Osaka.

            NPA Develops Optical Beacon

  The second police project is the "optical beacon," a new
type of IR vehicle detector that also serves as a high-
bandwidth communication device for supplying traffic
information to, and for receiving link travel times from,
equipped vehicles. The optical beacon was developed by the
NPA in conjunction with the JTMTA.

  As a vehicle detector, the optical beacon reportedly
functions as well or better than the ultrasonic detector
widely used in Japan. In addition, the optical beacon has
two-way communication capability with a downlink data rate of
1,024 kilobits and an uplink rate of 64 kilobits per second.
Sources say the optical detector is considerably less
expensive than the ultrasonic device. The NPA plans to
install 5,000 optical beacons per year starting in April this
year. The devices will be integrated into the traffic control
centers already in place in 74 major cities throughout Japan.

  The NPA's objective is to upgrade the existing traffic
control system and move toward the next generation system
under the UTMS (universal traffic management system) concept;
the optical beacon would function as an enabling technology
of the new system.

             VICS to Evaluate Optical Beacon

  The VICS Promotional Council, which has responsibility
through its committees for conducting investigations and
research as well as for promoting the use of VICS technology,
has agreed to study the optical beacon as one of several
possible communications media. Other candidate communication
links explored by VICS and/or the predecessor RACS and AMTICS
projects include microwave beacons, tele-terminals (cellular-
like mobile data communication systems) and FM sidebands (see
IH, September 1992).

  An agreement last fall by the VICS Promotional Council that
its operational body would be organized after consulting with
relevant government authorities lends credence to the notion
that the program has been stalled. The supply of VICS
information would begin soon after the operational body is
established. The VICS operation will collect and consolidate
traffic data from the MC for intercity and urban toll roads
and from the police departments for urban streets. The
operation will interface via two or more communication links
with in-vehicle units.

  Other current VICS activities include those of the
international liaison office of the VICS Promotional Council
which, in addition to publishing the VICS Newsletter, serves
as the principal interface between Japanese IVHS activities
and those in Europe and North America. VICS, in essence, is
the closest Japanese counterpart of ERTICO in Europe and IVHS
America.

TIGER PROJECT SEEKS LICENSE,
FUNDING FROM U.K. GOVERMENT

  Over the next several months, the ill-fated Autoguide
project, now dubbed TIGER, may finally get underway. The
project's two stumbling blocks -- funding support and a
license from the Department of Transport to operate a dynamic
route guidance system in central London -- are being
addressed with renewed vigor by private and public
participants.

            Statement in House of Commons

  The importance the British government is putting on the new
project was highlighted in late December when Steven Norris,
the Transport Minister for London, took the unusual step of
issuing a statement in the House of Commons explaining the
background of the project. In the statement he confirmed the
view that the latest developments in cellular radio have
superseded the infrared (IR) technology and a new trial was
being prepared which the government would monitor closely.

  However, due to the adverse publicity stemming from the
continued delay in implementing the IR beacon-based
Autoguide, both the Department of Transport and GEC, TIGER's
main backers, are wary about publicizing the new project.

        License Could Be Granted Within 10 Weeks

  In any event, it looks as if the project is proceeding.
Eric Sampson, a senior official at the Department of
Transport, estimates that a license under the Road Traffic
Act could be granted to TIGER (Traffic Information and
Guidance on European Roads) officials within the next 10
weeks. Several versions of a licensing agreement have been
drafted. "Lawyers are crawling over it, as lawyers do," he
says.

  While Sampson acknowledges that the licensing process is
advancing slowly, he says GEC is largely responsible for the
pace of the negotiations and that the firm does not seem
unhappy with the current status of the effort. "GEC is not on
my doorstep screaming and shouting," he says.

  In addition to seeking the license, TIGER officials have
applied for government funding for the project from the
Department of Trade and Industry. GEC's Nigel Stansfield, the
project manager, says the total cost of the trial should be
10 million pounds sterling to 15 million pounds sterling.
Project costs would be shared among TIGER participants and
the British government. Funding from the Department of Trade
and Industry would be channeled through the PROMETHEUS
program, which Stansfield says could provide 25 to 40 percent
of the project costs.

  Along with GEC, TIGER participants include: Ford, British
Telecom, and the two main motoring organizations, the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC) and the Automobile Association (AA).

           200 to 500 Cars Could Be Equipped

  Stansfield says each of the main participants will have a
specific role within the project. GEC will manage the trial
as well as operating a dedicated traffic information center,
which is slated to be in North London. Ford would supply test
vehicles, probably up to 200 but maybe as high as 500. The
RAC is set to supply the traffic information, which would be
transmitted to the North London traffic center from the RAC's
own traffic control center in Croyden, south London. The AA
would supply the in-vehicle digitized road maps while British.
Telecom would supply the in-vehicle communications hardware.
as well as the cellular link. TIGER is planning to use Cellnet,
a private cellular company which is 60 percent owned by British
Telecom.

  For in-vehicle navigation systems, TIGER will most likely
use equipment from Philips, Motorola and Robert Bosch,
according to Stansfield. Following the trial, TIGER officials
may decide to market one of the three systems or another
design.

  TIGER is designed to guide motorists through the least
congested streets. Dynamic traffic information would be
transmitted to the specially equipped cars over the cellular
network. The vehicles themselves would act as probes of the
roadway network as vehicle positions and travel speeds would
be transmitted back to the traffic center. The field trial's
boundaries have not yet been established. But it's expected
that the route guidance system would cover the area within
the city's North and South Circular Roads.

              Local Concern About Rat-Runners

  While the Department of Transport may be in favor of the
TIGER project, some local authorities have another opinion.
John Davies, director of highways for the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea -- one of the busy inner London
boroughs -- and also transport advisor to the London Boroughs
Association -- which represents the views of many London
boroughs -- fears route guidance systems are likely to
encourage motorists to abandon the main roads and start using
otherwise quiet residential streets, much to the annoyance of
local residents.

  He believes the deployment of more traditional traffic
mitigation measures would be a more effective way of reducing
local congestion. Davies favors better parking control and
"urban clearways," rather than trying to displace vehicles
from busy streets altogether.

  If necessary, Davies says he will not hesitate to prevent
cars equipped with route guidance systems from using
residential streets in his borough. "We shall make some side
streets one-way only and put chicanes and speed humps on
others to make sure motorists won't use them."

  Like other London borough engineers, Davies says he already
gets many letters from local residents complaining about
excessive traffic on residential streets, and he fears that a
route guidance system would simply encourage more motorists
to become "rat-runners," (who try to dodge traffic on the
major roads by driving on smaller, residential routes).

  The Department of Transport's Sampson acknowledges that
local concerns about rat-runners have to be addressed. "The
boroughs are worried that route guidance systems will send
traffic from the larger roads onto smaller roads," he says.

  As part of its role in the project, the Department of
Transport has announced it will hold discussions with all the
relevant bodies that might be affected by the project. They
include representatives from London's 33 borough councils,
the Metropolitan Police and London's Traffic Director.

  Despite his concerns, Davies does believe a dynamic route
guidance system would be useful in helping motorists find the
best bridges to drive across the river Thames. At present, he
says many motorists make uninformed guesses about which
bridges are least congested.

  Stansfield predicts that the main trial should begin in the
summer of 1994 and will last for at least six months.
Assuming the project is a success, he estimates that a
commercial product could be available by 1996 or '97, perhaps
with a price tag as low as 500 pounds sterling with an annual
subscription fee of 100 to 200 pounds sterling.

U.S. DELEGATION SEEKS EURO
SUPPORT FOR NEW ISO PANEL

  A group of IVHS industry officials in the U.S. is spearheading
an intiative to establish international IVHS standards. The IVHS
division of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in
Warrendale, Pa. has succeeded in establishing an international
IVHS standards committee within the International Standards
Organization (ISO) in Geneva.

  Earlier this month, the new technical committee, TC 204,
held a "preparatory meeting" in Geneva in an attempt to
solicit support and cooperation from European IVHS/RTI
officials already involved in standards making activity.
Seventeen officials attended the meeting. The main
standardization organizations in Europe were represented at
the one-day event, including the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), European Electrotechnical
Standardization Organization (CENELEC), European
Standardization Organization (CEN), International Telegraph
and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) and the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

      SAE Serves as Secretariat of New Committee

  "We really have the support of all these national
organizations," says Arlan Stehney, an SAE official who is
serving as secretariat of the new ISO committee. SAE, as an
organization, will serve as secretariat of TC 204 on behalf
of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
according to Stehney.

  While the list of organizations and acronyms may be
confusing, the stated purpose of the new committee is not,
say its organizers. "What the ISO does is really pull them
all together," says Stehney. "Their standards efforts will
channel into the ISO committee." He stresses that the new ISO
committee will not replace other RTI/IVHS standardization
efforts currently underway.

        International Standards: A Tall Order

  Electronic toll collection and other related applications,
such as road pricing, is an area of immediate concern to RTI
officials in Europe and to their counterparts in the U.S. As
the number of electronic toll systems competing in the
marketplace continues to grow rapidly, the incompatibility of
those systems threatens to compromise the convenience gains
promised by the technology. The well-documented difficulty
that state and regional officials have encountered in trying
to establish standards for electronic tolling underscores the
complexity of the issues the ISO is trying to address on an
international scale. The establishment of regional, let alone
national, standards has proved to be a daunting task.

  The initiative is obviously an ambitious one and it remains
to be seen whether the existing standardizing bodies will
fully cooperate with ISO's new IVHS committee, which,
incidentally, has tentatively adopted the European acronym
RTI, for road transport informatics.

             Duplication of Work Avoided

  Considerable work on IVHS/RTI standards is already underway
in Europe, particularly within CEN and CENELEC. "We're trying
to avoid any kind of duplication of work," says Siemens'
director of exterior relations, Heinz Sodeikat, who attended
the ISO meeting on behalf of the IEC and CENELEC. Sodeikat
points out that CEN and CENELEC have previously reached
agreements about which RTI application areas the two groups
will develop standards for. CENELEC focuses on
"electrotechnical" issues while CEN covers non-
electrotechnical systems, he says.

  While Sodeikat expresses a willingness to cooperate with
the new ISO committee, he notes that there are already "too
many" committees working on RTI standardization issues.
"Unfortunately, it's inevitable," he says.

  Dik Van Wijk, a project manager from the Dutch Ministry of
Transport who serves as chairman of CEN's RTI committee, is
supportive of the new ISO committee. What's more, he says
support for it is growing in Europe. Initially, officials
from many European countries "did not show much enthusiasm"
for the ISO initiative, says Van Wijk. But since the ISO
technical board formally approved the RTI committee plan in
December, more countries have expressed a willingness to
cooperate with it.

  Six countries, including three in Europe, have already
established official links to the ISO committee. They are the
Netherlands, U.K., Czechoslovakia, Japan, China and the U.S.
Others are expected to join. "Germany has already indicated
that they're interested," says Stehney.

  Even with their most optimistic outlook, organizers of the
ISO committee don't expect to establish international
standards for all IVHS applications. "There may be areas
where international standards are not viable," acknowledges
Stehney, who cites radio frequency allocation as a likely
problem area. "You can't standardize frequencies," he says.

  Richard J. Weiland, vice chairman of SAE's IVHS division,
agrees. "The magic word in the international arena is
harmonization," he says. Weiland is the general manager of
SEI Technology Group as well as chairman of the standards and
protocols committee of IVHS America, the Washington, D.C.-
based advocacy group that serves as an advisory committee to
the U.S. Department of Transportation.

  Along with other members of the U.S. delegation, Weiland
was pleased with the outcome of the Geneva meeting. Two
informal resolutions were passed. One recognizes the
organizations currently involved with RTI standardization in
Europe and recommends that once an initial work program is
accepted, that an ISO/CEN coordination meeting be convened.
The other resolution stemmed from a separate meeting the same
day with an existing ISO committee -- TC 22 -- that is
already working on RTI standards. TC 22 is ISO's
road/vehicles committee. The new and existing ISO committees
have agreed that TC 22 will retain primary responsibility for
man-machine interface and other in-vehicle systems while the
new RTI committee -- TC 204 -- will be responsible for
overall systems and infrastructure issues.

       ISO Committee Proposes 11 Working Groups

  ISO's new RTI committee is proposing to establish 11
working groups. They are 1. architecture and open system
interfaces; 2. spatial databases; 3. traffic/transit/parking
information collection and distribution; 4. traffic
management systems and coordination; 5. public, emergency and
commercial fleet management; 6. short range communications;
7. wide area communications; 8. navigation, positioning and
route guidance; 9. safety critical software; 10. human
interfaces and ergonomics; and 11. vehicle/highway
automation.

  The structure of the new committee and its program of work
will be discussed further at the first formal meeting of TC
204, which will be in Washington, D.C. Stehney says the event
is scheduled to take place April 19-21 at the Georgetown
University Conference Center. The meeting is open to
interested parties. For more information, call Stehney at
+412-776-4841.

GENERAL LOGISTICS EXPANDS
TRAFFICMASTER IN U.S. AND U.K

  General Logistics' Trafficmaster network is expanding
within the United Kingdom and, most recently, abroad as well.
The Luton, U.K. firm has secured its first licensee in the
U.S.

  Westinghouse Electric Corp. in Baltimore, Md. has licensed
the technology for the traffic information service from
General Logistics. For an undisclosed sum, Westinghouse has
acquired the exclusive rights to market and operate
Trafficmaster in four regions of the U.S. The system, which
notifies motorists about traffic congestion on local
highways, is currently operating on the M25 motorway in
London.

            Westinghouse Becomes U.S. Licensee

  "It's the only commercialized system successfully operating
in the world. There's no reason we shouldn't have it here,"
says Dan B. Zeitlin, manager of IVHS systems at Westinghouse
and the person in charge of its Trafficmaster project.

  As part of the agreement, General Logistics will supply
Westinghouse with the in-vehicle hardware and roadside
equipment as well as training and engineering support.
Depending on which firm you ask, the agreement extends for 12
or 15 years. Both parties describe the pact as a "long term
agreement."

   Westinghouse is planning to launch two Trafficmaster pilot
projects this year and to introduce commercial service at
those same sites next year. Don't expect to see
advertisements for Trafficmaster, however. The system will be
marketed under a different name, which Westinghouse hasn't
yet selected. The firm is open to suggestions, according to
Zeitlin, who says Westinghouse's legal department and
marketing gurus are mulling over a list of proposed names.
"It's a huge list," he says.

  While the two firms signed the agreement in late December,
neither has formally announced it. What's more, neither party
will say what the contract is worth nor what regions of the
U.S. are covered in the agreement. "I'm not at liberty to
disclose the value of the deal. But we're very happy with
it," says David K. Martell, chairman and managing director at
General Logistics.

  Westinghouse plans to release more details about the
agreement after it has secured approval from a local
transportation authority to proceed with a pilot project.
"Clearly, we need the public authorities' approval," says
Zeitlin. "We're having discussions with transportation
officials."

           Trafficmaster on Capital Beltway?

  Sources close to the project say Westinghouse is initially
targeting the Capital Beltway in Washington, D.C. and the
Baltimore Beltway as sites for the first pilot projects.
While Zeitlin declines to confirm this, he doesn't deny it
either. "Certainly, Maryland is of great interest because
we're based here. And the D.C. area is a good market," says
Zeitlin in response to questions about the two sites.

  Martell says the agreement permits Westinghouse to operate
Trafficmaster services in four states. Zeitlin says the
licensing agreement covers four territories, and that more
than four states are included in those territories. In any
event, Zeitlin says Westinghouse wants to establish
Trafficmaster services on the east coast, west coast and in
the midwest.

  At present, Westinghouse is the only Trafficmaster licensee
in the U.S. General Logistics, however, is currently engaged
in negotiations with other firms interested in marketing
Trafficmaster elsewhere in the U.S. Martell doesn't expect
any other agreements will be signed in the next "couple
months." He says the Westinghouse deal is "by far the most
advanced" of the initiatives underway in North America.
General Logistics has already signed licensing agreements
with firms in Italy and Austria.

           U.K. Expansion Set for April 27

  Back in the U.K., General Logistics has set April 27 as the
launch date for the expanded Trafficmaster network, which
will extend to Birmingham, Bristol and the Channel ports. The
existing network includes 120 infrared (IR) traffic detector
sites; the expanded network will add 300 more sites. Martell
says detectors at 230 of the 300 new sites have already been
installed.

  To date, Martell says there are more than 3,000
Trafficmaster subscribers using the London area network. Over
the past six months, he says 200 new subscribers have been
recruited per month. "With the geographic expansion, that
figure should increase dramatically," he says.

  Unlike most other IVHS projects in the U.S., Westinghouse's
Trafficmaster plan doesn't call for federal funding.
Trafficmaster is a commercial service: in the U.K., the
portable unit is priced at 199 pounds sterling and the
monthly subscription charge is 20 pounds sterling.
Installation is 50 pounds sterling. A rental option permits
subscribers to pay 30 pounds sterling per month in user fees
in addition to the 50 pound sterling installation charge.

  While pricing has not been established for the U.S.
introduction of Trafficmaster, the basic system design will
not be modified by Westinghouse, at least not initially. The
portable receiver is designed to work in a vehicle. The
unit's backlit LCD displays areas of congestion on the
motorway network by means of flashing blocks, which show the
location, speed and direction of snarled traffic.

  The system relies on a dedicated network of IR traffic
detectors that log the speed of passing vehicles. If the IR
devices determine that traffic is traveling below a pre-set
threshold of 30 mph, a message is relayed via a data radio
link supplied by Paknet, Ltd. to the Trafficmaster control
center in Luton. Updated traffic information is then
transmitted every three minutes from the control center to
the in-car receivers. The information is broadcast to the
portable units over the Air Call Paging network. Westinghouse
is planning to use IR traffic detectors and a paging network
for its Trafficmaster system in the U.S. "We're in
negotiations with a paging company," says Zeitlin.
Westinghouse may not, however, use a data radio link to
transmit information from the remote traffic detectors to the
control center. Zeitlin says project officials are
considering other means of transmitting the raw traffic data,
such as land lines.

         Westinghouse Initiates Negotiations

  The Westinghouse/General Logistics deal stemmed from
negotiations initiated by Westinghouse. "They approached us
about a year ago," says General Logistics' Martell.
Westinghouse, which is making a considerable investment in
several IVHS applications areas, sees Trafficmaster as one of
its traveler information system offerings. "This is only part
of it," says Zeitlin. In the future, Westinghouse may
integrate the Trafficmaster data with other traffic
management systems, he says.

U.K. RTI GROUP LINES UP
STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS

  The newly formed RTI/IVHS information group in the United
Kingdom has established a steering committee that includes
several key players in the industry. RTI Focus (UK) Ltd., a
new group with non-profit status based at the government's
Transport Research Laboratory in Berkshire, has the support
of the Department of Transport and major electronics firms,
transport consultancies and academia.

      Department of Transport Supports New Group

  Susan Harvey, the company's founding chief executive, says
the steering committee consists of representatives from the
Department of Transport, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), Peek
Traffic, GEC Traffic Controls, Jaguar, Dowty Electronics, the
Royal Automobile Club (RAC), the Met Office, University of
London Transport Studies Unit, Croyden Borough Council
(London), Strathclyde Borough Council (Glasgow), London
Transport, the Metropolitan Police, Travers Morgan and
Halcrow Fox.

  Harvey says that the steering committee members have had to
pay a hefty 4,000 pound sterling annual subscription fee,
which will help defray the 150,000 pound sterling start-up
and operating costs. However, she says the annual fee for the
steering committee members is expected to decline to 3,000
pounds sterling in the second year and to 2,000 pounds
sterling in the third year.

  Harvey says the next step for RTI Focus is to recruit
additional members. She expects the group to be fully
operational by June and, in time, to include up to 200 firms.
The cost of becoming a member without representation on the
steering committee has been set at 500 pounds sterling.

  The group's primary role, according to Harvey, is to
promote the interests of its members as well as advancing RTI
developments. One of the main benefits of membership, she
says, will be access to the large RTI database which is to be
established at the TRL and will contain details of industry
firms in the U.K. as well as RTI developments abroad.

  In addition, she says the group will publish a quarterly
newsletter, arrange four meetings a year for the steering
committee and organize two seminars per year which all
members would be eligible to attend.

         Liaison Sought With Other Associations

  RTI Focus has received support from officials in Brussels
and from the Department of Transport in London about
presenting papers at upcoming seminars, Harvey says. In the
future, she hopes the group will have enough funding to be
able to commission its own RTI research. The group has also
established contacts with officials at the ERTICO and DRIVE
offices in Brussels and at the IVHS America office in
Washington, D.C.

  Prior to starting up the RTI association, Harvey was an
industrial advisor and transport specialist at the National
Economic Development Office (NEDO) in London. In addition to
Harvey's role at RTI Focus, she has recently established a
new transport consultancy in London, named Traffic Solutions
Ltd. Harvey, along with partner Peter O'Neil, who formerly
worked at the DRIVE office in Brussels, is planning to do RTI
consulting work.

                 How Big Is The Market?

  A recent NEDO report estimates the size of the UK RTI
industry at about 60 million pounds sterling. By the year
2010, NEDO estimates the RTI market will be worth 3 billion
pounds sterling. "The same phenomenal growth is also being
predicted worldwide," says Harvey. The biggest potential
growth areas in RTI are dynamic route guidance systems and
electronic tolls, she says.

  Eamonn McArdle, managing director of Peek Traffic, believes
the new group will play a significant role in promoting RTI.
"We hope the group will campaign on behalf of major RTI
issues as well as helping to push sales of new U.K. RTI
products for all the members."

NEWS IN BRIEF

  *It looks as if the new presidential administration in
Washington, D.C. will continue to support, and fund, IVHS. As
part of his recently unveiled economic plan, President Bill
Clinton is calling for $345 million in IVHS funding for
fiscal years 1994-1997. The plan also calls for $100 million
in IVHS funding for FY98, which is beyond Clinton's current
term.

  While these numbers appear to be reduced from the IVHS
funding levels outlined in the six-year Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) passed in 1991, the
budget numbers cited above reportedly are intended to be
additions to the ISTEA provisions, according to the Federal
Highway Administration, which sought an explanation of the
figures from the Office of Management and Budget. ISTEA
authorizes $113 million per year in IVHS funding. If Congress
approves Clinton's plan, federal funding for IVHS over the
next four years could top $200 million per year. By
comparison, the federal government -- under the Bush
Administration -- has budgeted $143 million in IVHS funding
for the current fiscal year.

  *Copies of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT)
IVHS strategic plan are available from the FHWA's office of
traffic management and IVHS. The DOT submitted the five year
plan to Congress in December as required by ISTEA. Requests
for copies can be faxed to the FHWA at 202-366-2249 or mailed
to the agency at 400 7th Street S.W., Washington, D.C.,
20590.

  The 67 page document outlines the goals and milestones of
the DOT's IVHS program for the next five years. "What is
needed is a 'smarter' surface transportation system, one that
actually functions as an integrated intermodal system,
offering improved safety, more efficient use of
infrastructure, and enhanced user choices through the
application of IVHS technologies and services," writes the
DOT in the executive summary of its report.

  While the report acknowledges IVHS America's contribution
to DOT's plan, the federal agency's report does not derive
directly from the five year strategic plan developed by the
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, says George Beronio, a
systems engineer at FHWA.

  DOT's plan establishes 18 milestones to be accomplished
during the next five years. "Beyond 1997, deployment of a
nationally compatible IVHS system will become the
Department's primary concern. Work will shift towards
supporting deployment of IVHS user services, and continuing
progress on long-term IVHS goals, especially the Automated
Highway System," writes the DOT.

  *Following expansion of its Trafficmaster network up to the
Birmingham area, General Logistics is hoping to establish its
traffic information system in Scotland. David K. Martell,
chairman and managing director at General Logistics in Luton
near London, says negotiations are underway with the Scottish
Office about installing Trafficmaster on the motorways in the
Glasgow and Edinburgh area. While compatible with the system
in England, Martell says the Scottish system would be
operated separately.

  *For electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) system
vendors, the order of the day seems to be to sue one another.
In the latest move, AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. has filed
two patent infringement suits against its chief competitors,
Amtech and Mark IV/Vapor. In the suits, filed in U.S.
District Court in Boston, AT/Comm claims "that the newest
generation of electronic toll collection systems known as
read-write, in the forms produced by Amtech and Mark
IV/Vapor, are in direct conflict with claims under AT/Comm
patents," according to a statement issued by AT/Comm. The
Massachusetts ETTM vendor says the suits could directly
affect procurements in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and
Orlando.
