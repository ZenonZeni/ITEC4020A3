<h2 align=center>Reauthorization of IDEA</h2>

<p><b>Justine Maloney
<br>June 2, 1996</b></p>

<p>On May 31, the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee passed
its version of the reauthorization of IDEA Despite the arguments of the
Democratic members, the amendment which would remove the provision in the
bill which would allow schools to treat students with disabilities who
bring a weapon or drugs to school and whose behavior is not a manifestation
of their disability as they do students without disabilities failed on
party lines. The Republican response to the argument that a number of states
do not cease educational services to students but rather send them to alternative
education programs was that advocates in states which did not have alternative
education programs should work for legislation at the state level, because
the federal government should not tell states what to do. Fortunately,
the Committee passed the Miller amendments which would require that a hearing
officer review any decision to end educational services and to make it
harder to find that the behavior was NOT a manifestation of the disability.
Amendments to require that the evaluation be multi-disciplinary, to restore
the child count for funding, and to strike restrictions of the Policy Letters
from the Department of Education failed. </p>

<p>Rumor has it that the Senate bill may come to the floor for a vote next
week. The House bill may move to the floor within a couple of weeks. There
are only 20 legislative days left in this session of Congress. If IDEA
is to pass in this Congress, these bills must be passed without amendments
and/or a lengthy floor fight. Moreover, one staffer whose member supported
the removal of the cessation provision warned that if the bill is open
to floor amendments, the final bill could be worse than the one just passed
by the Committee. </p>

<p>Several national organizations, including DLD (the Division for Learning
Disabilities), TASH (The Association for the Severely Handicapped), SAFE
(Schools are for Everyone), and UCPA (the United Cerebral Palsy Association)
have come out in opposition to the bill, willing to give up discretionary
programs in order to keep Part B as it is. The LDA Board must now decide
whether to </p>

<ul>
<li>oppose both bills now because they include cessation of educational
services. </li>

<li>stay silent on both bills because LDA cannot support cessation of services.
</li>

<li>support the bills because the positive changes outweigh the negative
changes. </li>

<li>wait until the final bill comes out of the House Senate conference,
and if it is unacceptable, ask for a Presidential veto. </li>
</ul>

<p>LDA must also take into consideration the facts that </p>

<ul>
<li>the authorization for the discretionary programs (early intervention,
personnel preparation, research and development, and information clearing
houses) will expire, Appropriations committees are reluctant to provide
funding for programs which have no authorization, as shown by this year’s
battle to restore funding for discretionary programs </li>

<li>the 105th Congress, particularly on the Senate side, may be more anti-federal
government than this Congress. Hence, new IDEA bills could be worse than
the current ones. </li>

<li>efforts to reauthorize the discretionary programs could get waylaid
because of the need to reauthorize the higher education act, and </li>

<li>parents and advocates are beginning to burn out. This process has been
going on for 3 years now-. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following information is given to help make that decision. </p>

<p>IMPROVEMENTS OVER CURRENT LAW (General concepts only. Details on demand.)
</p>

<ul>
<li>Parents are to be involved in eligibility and placement decisions for
their child. </li>

<li>Evaluation to consider the emotional and social needs of the child.
</li>

<li>Reevaluation to consider whether the child continues to need special
education, not whether or not he/she has a disability. </li>

<li>The regular education teacher, when appropriate, participates in the
IEP Process. </li>

<li>Accommodations are written into the IEP </li>

<li>the IEP must consider the behavioral and communication needs of the
child, when appropriate </li>

<li>Students with disabilities must be allowed to take standardized assessments,
with accommodations, if necessary. </li>

<li>transition considerations, i.e. course of study, to begin at age 14.
</li>

<li>the IEP team reviews the childs needs and necessary supplementary aids
needed before the child’s placement is changed </li>

<li>mediation must be offered to parents in an effort to settle disputes
</li>
</ul>

<p>PROVISIONS IN ONE BILL AND NOT THE OTHER:TO BE SETTLED BY CONFERENCE
</p>

<ul>
<li>funding based on child count (Senate) or percentage of school population
(House) </li>

<li>the evaluation team must consider whether the students problems may

or economic disadvantage, or poor instruction (House) </li>

<li>a teacher can call an IEP meeting to consider further strategies for
dealing with a problem child (House) </li>

<li>short term objectives (House) </li>

<li>Interagency agreements of payment for related services </li>

<li>Federal Interagency Coordinated Council eliminated in House bill </li>
</ul>

<p>CONCERNS WHICH HAVE BEEN SETTLED SATISFACTORILY </p>

<li>Waivers for 10 model LEA’s in House Bill eliminated </li>

<li>Waivers to 4 State Model Programs for Part H. House, withdrawn temporarily
</li>

<li>Federal commitment to 40% of excess costs restored to House bill </li>
</ul>

<p>PROVISIONS IN BOTH BILLS TO BE OPPOSED BY LDA </p>

<ul>
<li>Cessation of educational services for students with disabilities </li>

<li>Lowering of highest professional standard </li>

<li>Encouraging (Senate) or requiring (House) parents to use their insurance
money </li>

<li>Reducing attorneys fees if 1) the parent or attorney does not give
a 10 day advance notice of the intention of filing a due process or 2)
the parent does not give a 10-day advance notice of intention of placing
a student in a private school and asking for reimbursement. </li>

<li>Establishing a Coordinated Services System which allows services to
students without disabilities and the co-mingling of IDEA and other agency
funds </li>
</ul>
