Photoresist Coats
Tube Interiors

Chunghwa Picture Tubes (Illinois) was awarded U.S. Patent 5,536,994
for a new thin film photoresist for the inside of cathode ray tubes
on July 16, 1996.  A description follows.

The inner surface of a video display panel such as cathode ray tube
(CRT) glass faceplate is initially coated with a mixture of one of
the primary color phosphors, an organic binder such as polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) diluted with water, and a photoresist agent. The
organic binder overcomes the poor adhesion to the glass faceplate
of the photoresist which typically includes polyvinyl pyrrolidone
(PVP) and reduces the oxygen which decreases phosphor exposure
time.

To overcome PVA and PVP incompatibilities which give rise to
nonuniform film thickness, a vinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl alcohol (VP-
VA) copolymer is added to the phosphor, organic binder and
photoresist mixture in the range of 0.1-30 wt%. The copolymer with
both the VP and VA functioning groups serves as a coupling agent
between the PVA and PVP and eliminates incompatibilities between
these components. The VP-VA copolymer preferably has a VP/VA mole
ratio in the range of 20/80 to 80/20.

latest highest speed PCI logic chipset, support for all 486 class
up to Pentium Class 586 CPUs, PCI accelerated video with flat panel
interface, and onboard controllers for SCSI-2 LAN, touch screen,
floppy and hard drives (PCI EIDE to PIO mode 4) and a 16 bit sound
chip with amplifier and operational flash disk support.

The PCI onboard bus implementation runs at the maximum PCI
specification of 33 MHz, and connects the vital high throughput
peripherals (Ethernet LAN, SCSI, hard drive and video system) to
the CPU by the fastest possible means to avoid delays in system
performance.  The DPX-57 also supports EDO RAM up to 64 MB for
system memory.

The video system is based around the latest chipsets and includes
up to 2 MB VRAM, 64-bit hardware video acceleration, hardware video
playback support via a VESA advanced feature connector and PCI CPU
connection with Burst Mode and BIOS ROM support.  Video expansion
via the VAFC allows overlay of real time video from NTSC/PAL or
MPEG sources such as CCD video cameras, VCR or frame grabber.

The DPX-57 is ideal for embedded control applications particularly
those using a flat screen display.  All flat panel technologies are
supported including AMLCD (TFT), FSTN color and monochrome, EL and
plasma.  High resolution flat panel displays up to 1280 x 1024
pixels can be driven.  The onboard touch screen decoder opens up a
whole range of POS, factory automation, SCADA (Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition), man-machine interface and operator interface
applications.  In addition to flat panels, the DPX-57 will drive
non-interlaced CRT monitors.

The high level of integration and compact size ensures this unit's
suitability for a wide range of industrial, commercial and OEM

NEC Research
Improves Phosphors

The fact that NEC is a player in flat panel displays does not mean
that the company is giving up on the CRT.  A recent example
supports their continuing advancements in this traditional display
technology.  NEC's CromaClear CRT features illuminated elliptical-
shaped phosphors designed to improve color saturation, focus, and
contrast.  The design benefits the display of video windows and
complex multi-media images.

A video boost feature also improves video applications by
maximizing contrast and brightness to closely approximate the image
brightness of video and TV.  Offered in 15-in. and 17-in. sizes,
the MultiSync M family of monitors also has integrated speakers and
microphone.

Hitachi Markets
Large Screens

High brightness and high display density are required for desktop
computers with paper-white displays on white backgrounds.  Hitachi
(Tokyo, Japan) has met this need through the development of two
types of color display tubes (CDTs) that are capable of displaying
more than 2 million pixels.

One model, the 51 cm CDT, has a fine phosphor screen with
horizontal and vertical dot pitches of 0.22 and 0.16 mm,
respectively.  Information with 1,600 pixels by 1,200 lines can be
displayed on the A3-size screen.  The other model, the 56-cm CDT,
has a horizontally extended screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio that
has an excellent human visual angle.  It can display information
with 1,920 pixels by 1,080 lines.

Both new tubes feature a recently developed elliptical aperture
dynamic focus (A-EA-DF) electron gun with high focus.  They can
display over 2 million pixels of information with top notch
brightness and contrast.  In addition, they can operate at
horizontal scanning frequencies of 107 kHz or more, which provides
high-quality paper-white image with no flicker.

Monitor Designed for
Different Work Sites

A new LCD monitor made by RDI Computer Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) is
designed to be easily transported to a variety of worksites.
Tradenamed the PowerScreen, it is a standalone monitor with a 12.1-
in. diagonal, 1024 x 768 high resolution active matrix LCD.  It
weighs just 12.5 lbs. (60% lighter than comparable CRTs), and is
only 1 1/2 inches in depth.  The PowerScreen offers almost the same
viewable image size as a conventional 14-in. monitor.

As a special feature, the PowerScreen is available without
plastics.  That is, it can be integrated into a user's own system
for embedded applications such as process control, test and
measurement, and medical analyses.  In this configuration, the flat
panel module weighs just 8 lbs. and is only 1 1/4 in. deep.  Since
it can be wall mounted or embedded in equipment, it is ideal for
many OEM requirements.

Other benefits include 70% less power than most standard 14-in.
monitors and static free operation.  It is not affected by magnetic
induction and does not produce harmful x-ray emissions.  In
addition, it connects directly to a Sun SPARC workstation or PC
without adding hardware or software, and supports a variety of VESA
monitor timing standards.

RDI is known for its PowerLite ExtraView 110 portable workstation
that has a high resolution, 12.1-in. display with full SPARCstation
5 performance.  For more information, contact: RDI, 2300 Faraday

Desktop Market Is
Wide Open to LCDs

Two factors are bringing the liquid crystal display closer to the
CRT in the lucrative desktop market.  One is improving performance
of the LCD and the other, possibly more important, is the gradual
reduction in LCD monitor prices.  As the two key types of displays
get closer, pressure is mounting on the CRT.

A key advantage of flat panels is, and has always been, the need
for less space.  Recently, the New York Stock Exchange upgraded its
trading floor and, in the process, replaced their CRTs with LCDs
made by Sharp.  This is a prime example of how these flat panels
are being adapted even though the price is several times that of
the conventional CRT.  Another advantage that led to the
replacement of cathode ray tubes in a hospital is the fact that
LCDs do not present magnetic interference problems with medical
equipment.

Now that the laptop market is close to saturation, LCD makers such
as Sharp Electronics are saying that replacement of the CRT desktop
computer monitors will begin in the fourth quarter.  Sharp uses
some rough calculations about relative prices that we have also
heard from other companies and industry watchers.  For example, if
prices of LCDs fall to 3 times that of CRTs, there will be a market
potential of 5% of the desktop monitor market or 3 million units by
1997.  If LCD prices drop to 2 times the CRTs, the potential
increases to 15% or approximately 9 million units.  Most industry
experts agree that if price parity were to be achieved, the LCD
would be far ahead of the CRT in the desktop market.

Sharp isn't the only company playing in this field.  Others,
including Compaq and NEC, are also looking at the vast potential in
the desktop market.  Aerospace, graphic design and medical imaging
are emerging markets for the LCD desktop monitors.  But Sharp
recently opened an advanced manufacturing facility in Japan and
third generation manufacturing techniques will mass produce large
format LCDs.  Competition is heating up and, with all the emphasis
on reduced production cost, our guess is that it won't be long
until the CRT is under more pressure from LCD desktop units.

Memory Capabilities
Can Be Improved

Ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystals with improved contrast
ratios and memory capabilities, developed by scientists at Sumitomo
Chemical Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Bldg., 5-33 Kitahama, 4-Chome, Chuo-
ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/220 3272, Fax: 6/220 3345), are
intended for use in optical shutters and liquid crystal displays
(LCDs).  Among the advantages of LCDs, reports Chizu Sekine in U.S.
Patent 5,545,345, are a thin profile, light weight, a low driving
voltage, and low power demand.

Two types of driving systems, active matrix-addressed and passive
matrix-addressed, are commonly used.  In active matrix-addressed
systems, a thin film transistor or diode made of polysilicon or
amorphous silicon is connected to each picture element.  The
drawbacks of active matrix-addressed systems include problems in
assembling large area displays with good memory density.  Achieving
reasonable production costs is difficult, too--manufacturing is
complicated, and yields are low.

Passive matrix-addressed systems include two types: twisted nematic
and supertwisted nematic LCDs.  The optical response of such a
device is based on the average orientation of the molecular axis of
the liquid crystal in a specific direction, based on anisotropy of
the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal molecule, which, in
turn, is caused by the application of an electric field.  As a
result, the device's optical response speed is measured in
milliseconds, far too slow for the computers of the future.

The new Sumitomo Chemical ferroelectric chiral liquid crystals are
characterized by bistability, a property that causes such a
crystal, when held between a pair of glass plates--each carrying a
transparent electrode--to have two different optically stable
states, depending on directions of the applied electric field.  The
two optically stable states are maintained after the removal of the
electric fields.  As a result, such devices do not suffer from
decreased contrast ratios or cross-talk, even when the number of
scanning lines is increased.

Another advantage of the ferroelectric liquid crystals is their
high response speed, about 1,000 times faster than those of twisted
nematic and supertwisted nematic LCDs.  The crystals are based on
an alkyl group with 5-15 carbon atoms.  They also include a second
alkyl group with 1-10 carbon atoms or an alkoxyalkyl group with 2-
10 carbon atoms, of which one may be replaced by a halogen atom.

Two Dimensional
View in 3-D Display

Sanyo Electric (Tokyo, Japan) has done something unique to its 3-D
monitor that is intended to make it more practical.  The company
offers an option to 2-D viewing as well.

The 3-D display is based on Sanyo's image splitters, which are
extensions of a technology developed by Japan's government-owned
broadcasting network, NHK.  But viewers have difficulty in reading
text in 3-D so Sanyo added the 2-D function.  If, for example, the
3-D monitor is used with a PC, the operator can specify one portion
of the screen as 3-D and another as 2-D, thus separating objects
that will be seen in 3-D from text.

Switching back and forth is done with the assistance of special on-
off shutters.  When the switch is on, the splitters divide the
right and left eye images which creates the 3-D effect.  When the
switch is off, the image becomes 2-D.  The shutter is a single
sheet that can easily be added to the 3-D monitors.

Markets include medical applications, where a CAT scan image can be
shown in 3-D and the patient's chart could be read in two
dimensions.  The education field also offers numerous opportunities
for this technology with images in 3-D and explanatory text in 2-D.
Games are also seen as a potential market.

Microlens Arrays
Improve Lighting

Light throughput in a helmet mounted display has been increased by
two orders of magnitude through the use of microlens arrays
according to researchers at Hughes Danbury Optical Systems (HDOS,
Danbury, CT).  The company is developing a subtractive color
display that includes a lamp, polarizers and three 1024 x 1024
active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs).

In a typical display of this type, there is a loss of light that
lowers brightness and contrast since light passes from one pixel on
the first AMLCD through several pixels on the second and third
AMLCDs.  To overcome this problem, the researchers sandwich the
AMLCDs between microlens arrays that focus light into the active
area of each pixel.  There is a microlens before and after each
pixel in the light path.

There is one major problem, however.  Diffractive microlens arrays
are not totally effective because of the small size of each lens
and some light scattering problems.  To solve this dilemma, HDOS
researchers designed and made, by a proprietary process, analog
refractive elements.  The minimum center-to-center spacing of these
microlenses is about 10 um, and they are supposedly working better
than diffractive optics.

To compare the difference using the arrays, about 30% of the
illumination reaches the screen location, as opposed to less than
1% with no microlenses.  The company is looking into additional
applications for these lenses.

Active Matrix Color
Touch Monitor

National Integration Services (Rochester, NY) a leader in
customized touchscreen products, introduced the 1040VTT, a new
10.4-in. TFT Active Matrix LCD touch monitor.  Offering users plug-
and-play simplicity in a stylized, injection molded ABS housing,
the new product weighs only 6 lbs., is compact (11.9 x 4.9 x 10.9
in.), and is a low consumer of power.  Built around a bright,
crisp, quarter-million color TFT display, the stand-alone touch
monitor is configurable in both vertical and horizontal
orientations.  Accepting direct VBG input at 640 x 480 screen
resolution from a standard PC or Mac, no special video controller
is needed.  On screen display provides simple and quick set up.  A
five year touchscreen warrantee reflects the durability of the
touchscreen surface.  A magnetic stripe card reader is optional and
is useful for storing or updating device settings.

"LCD touch control offers big advantages in Industrial and Process
Control applications," said National Integration president Jim
Odorczyk.  "Their touch-what-you-want simplicity reduces training
time and costs.  They are easy to reconfigure by simply updating
the software.  Input is quick, and they are durable, reliable, easy
to clean, and resistant to heavy workplace abuse.  The 1040VTT is
unique because of its sleek, strong housing, low process, easy set-
up and mounting versatility.  Equipment space is always at a
premium in process control-type applications and our LCD
touchscreen needs only 5 in. of depth when using the optional
vertical mounting plate."

Other benefits include sealed case resistance to liquids and input
accuracy with any stylus such as a finger, gloved hand or pen.
Direct VGA input allows for unlimited distance from the PC and this
keeps the working area free of bulky master units.  The device's
light weight makes for easy mounting on a remote flexible arm.
Replacing both a mouse and a keyboard, its location is not limited
to flat surfaces.  In addition, the LCD is not impacted by magnetic
or electrical fields nearby as are conventional computer monitors.


NIS has comprehensive technical support in the form of plug and
play packages.  Current users of NIS products include Kodak, NASA,
Xerox and Johnson Controls.  The 1040VTTs can be used as individual
units or linked together with other microprocessor-based equipment.

Keeping Tabs
on Soldering Iron

A product called Look, made by Japan Boncoat Co., is an industrial
soldering iron that has a liquid crystal display to graphically
depict real-time temperature variations at the tip of the iron.
The product is aimed at manufacturers of computer equipment.

The company claims several key advantages to users of Look.  It can
improve quality control, increase soldering productivity and lower
the cost of training new workers.  Since changes in temperature and
soldering duration at each site are seen in real time, there are
fewer mistakes and less wasted time, according to the company.

Temperature variations during soldering operations are detected by
a heat sensor at the tip of the iron, and adjustments are made
through a patented "on-load temperature management" method, which
the company is trying to make into an industry standard.

Information is displayed in graphic form on an LCD panel and can be
printed out.  The soldering iron can function as a teaching tool
since it can collect data on the soldering operations of a seasoned
worker and this data can be made into guidelines for new employees.


Japan Boncoat expects to sell 1,000-2,000 units at about $1,100 the
first year in Asia and North America.  Responses from companies
using this new device have been positive.

U.S. Patent 5,543,947 for devising a new way to drive an active
matrix LCD with short pulses for gray scale.

The method consists of driving a liquid crystal electro-optical
device in such a way that the device produces accurate gray tones
with high reproducibility. In this device, a complementary TFT
(thin film transistor) configuration consisting of at least one p-
channel TFT and at least one n-channel TFT is formed per pixel
electrode. One of the input/output terminals of this configuration
is connected to the pixel electrode. The other is connected to a
first signal line.

All the gate electrodes of the TFTs of the configuration are
connected to a second signal line. High-speed pulses are applied to
one of the input/output terminals of the TFT configuration via the
first signal line. A high-speed bipolar signal is applied to the
gate electrodes in synchronism with the pulses, to electrically
charge the pixel.  After the completion of the charging, the
bipolar signal is again applied to the gate electrodes to discharge
the pixel. This series of operations is repeated to produce
halftones.

Production of TV
Monitors Moved Up

In recent additions of DTN, we have reported the rather long range
plans of many plasma panel makers to get into production of TV
displays by 1997 and 1998.  Now it appears there are two updates to
this story: mass production of TV panels is set for this fall, and
many manufacturers are expecting to make plasma displays for the
desktop market.

Plasma display panels are thinner and larger than LCDs and are also
lightweight.  A 40-in. panel is only 10-12 cm thick making this
technology the favorite for wall mounted TVs and placing it in
contention for the desk top market.  Although many in the industry
agree that plasma technology will eventually share the desk top
market with LCDs, they predict it will be a gradual process because
of the high plasma display prices (just over $9,000 for a panel at
the current time).

But plasma makers are building facilities.  Fujitsu Ltd. is
building a 20 billion yen manufacturing plant in southern Japan
that is expected to begin production of 42-in. screens in October
or November of this year.  By 2000, the company expects to invest
another 20 billion yen in production facilities.

Other companies are also expanding.  Pioneer Electronic Corp. has
broken ground in a location northwest of Tokyo that will be able to
make 10,000 panels per month.  They are targeted for production in
March, 1997.  Hitachi Ltd. is building a new production line in
Yokohama that will produce 26- and 40-in. displays.  By 1997, the
company plans to enter the 26-in. version in the desktop market.
NEC Corp. plans to spend 25 billion yen on a new plant in Kagoshima
Prefecture that will be able to make 10,000 screens per month by
1998.  NEC has been making 1,000 panels per month at its Kawasaki
plant since June.

Asahi Glass, which already produces glass substrates for LCDs, will
begin commercial production of substrates for these plasma systems
within a month.  The company expects plasma to become the dominant
technology for screens larger than 40 in.  Asahi is planning
monthly production of 100,000 glass substrates for 42-in. plasma
displays.

Another company, Dai Nippon Printing, is also planning to produce
substrates for large plasma screens by the end of 1997.  In
addition, Corning Inc. and Cie de Saint-Gobain have plans to start
production of large screen plasma display substrates later this
fall.

Despite all this activity, there is a general note of caution in
the plasma display sector.  Demand is still not as strong as many
would like and much of it is focused on public displays such as
those used in train stations and hospitals.  But the large size
screen, thin construction and light weight are advantages that will
assist plasma technology in finding a market.

Organic Panel
Needs Less Power

Idemitsu Kosan Co. (Tokyo) researchers have developed a multicolor,
organic EL display that may portend lower power consumption, full
color displays that will be practical for mobile multimedia
applications.  The company plans to sell the material and license
the technology used to make the display, and reports that it has
already supplied material to several potential customers.

Idemitsu wants companies to evaluate their technology.  According
to a senior researcher, VGA resolution is possible on an
experimental basis, but the driver circuitry and production
technology for a large screen must be developed at the display
manufacturers side.

EL displays that use inorganic materials for the emitting layer
are already on the market and are typically in green or orange and
black configurations.  Organic EL displays are capable of bright
colors, good brightness and contrast, and a better viewing angle
than LCDs.  Idemitsu's EL research started about 10 years ago when
the petroleum refining company began working with an organic
material called DPVBi which emitted a blue light.

The current EL device developed at the Idemitsu Central Research
Labs is a 5-in. square prototype with limited resolution of 16 x 16
pixels.  It has five layers: metal cathodes, an electron
transporting layer, an emitting layer, a hole transporting layer,
and a hole injection layer, topped with anodes made of indium tin
oxide.  This entire sandwich is only 200 nm thick.

A dopant added to the emitting layer improves the emission of a
bright blue light, reaching a peak wavelength of 468 nm.  At 5 V,
the brightness level was approximately 100 candela.  With a 10 V
field, the level rose to about 10,000 candela.

Idemitsu decided against developing multiple emitting materials
that could, on their own, emit red, blue and green.  The process
was considered to be too expensive.  Instead, the blue light
generated by the emissive layer passes through phosphor layers that
act as color filters, changing the blue light to red and to green.
The phosphors absorb a portion of the high energy blue light and
emit green or red light.

The prototype display has 256 square pixels measuring 4.5 mm on a
side.  They consist of three 1.5 x 4.5 mm subpixels of red, blue
and green phosphor stripes.  Most organic materials deteriorate
rapidly, but the material used at Idemitsu has a long life.  The
prototype's half-life is more than 10,000 hrs.

Other companies that are working on organic displays include Sanyo
Electric and Pioneer Electronics.

High Luminance Devices
Use Oxide Phosphors

Researchers at the Electron Device System Lab (Kanazawa Institute
of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan) have demonstrated that oxide
phosphors, which exhibit higher chemical stability than sulphide
phosphors, show promise as emitting layers for thin film
electroluminescent (TFEL) devices.  Zinc gallate (ZnGa204), which
has received attention as a blue-emitting phosphor for vacuum
fluorescent (VFDs) and field emission displays (FEDs), has been
developed for a thin film emitting layer combined with a thick
barium titanate (BaTi03) ceramic sheet insulating layer.

The researchers used a non-symmetrical single insulating layer
device in their study of this material.  Every constituent, except
the back electrode (thermally evaporated aluminum) of this device
was an oxide material.  The emitting layer, insulating layers and
transparent electrode, were composed of ZnGa204 phosphor thin
films, thick BaTi03 ceramic sheet and aluminum-doped zinc oxide
(Zn0:Al) transparent conducting thin film, respectively.

Zinc gallate phosphor thin films were deposited by rf magnetron
sputtering onto the polished barium titanate ceramic sheets.  The
thickness of the films deposited was controlled almost to a
constant 1500 nm.  The phosphor thin films were post-annealed at
1020 C in an argon gas atmosphere.  Luminances as high as 630 and
200 cd/m2 for green emission were obtained for a manganese-
activated zinc gallate device.  Multicolor emission was also
realized through the use of other dopants.

A detailed description of this project is available in the July
issue of the Journal of the Society for Information Display (Santa
Ana, CA 92705, Tel: 714/545-1526, Fax: 714/545-1547).

Robust Organic High
Temperature Device

A group at Toyota in Japan (Contact: Shizuo Tokito, Toyota Central

Nagakute-cho, Aichi-gun, Aichi-ken 480-11, Japan; email:

development of an organic electroluminescent material which can
function at temperatures up to 140C with a turn-on voltage of 2.1
V and an efficiency of 1.25 lm/W.

These materials are being looked to as active components of flat
panel displays but to date the organic electroluminescent materials
have been plagued by degradation of the hole transporting layer,
probably due to Joule heating from the high injection current
utilized for the device operation.  The Toyota group has
synthesized a new hole transporting material, a triphenylamine
tetramer, with a glass temperature of 130C, which permits
operation of the organic electroluminescent device with uniform
light emission.  A typical emitting material, tris (8-
quinolinolato) aluminum (Alq) was used in the device.

Light Valve TV
Relies on Elastomer

A projector that uses an elastomer film inside of a CRT has been
developed in the U.K.  The elastomer layer is placed on the inside
face plate of an electron beam tube.  Then, a mirror is deposited
over the layer, followed by a second elastomer layer.  The layers
are then covered with a dielectric layer which is more rigid than
the elastomers.

The mirror is used as one electrode and the charge pattern
deposited by the electron beam on the dielectric layer makes up the
other electrode.  The electrostatic forces that result deform the
mirror and produce ripples or grooves.  When the mirror is flat,
incident light from the lamp will be reflected and imaged on the
schlieren stop which blocks it and causes the screen to become
black.  When grooves are written, however, incident light will be
diffracted at an angle, lets it miss the stop, and a bright spot is
projected on the screen.  Gray scale can be effected by varying the
magnitude of the charge.  TV pictures are projected by scanning and
modulating the electron beam with video signals.  The charge
pattern and grooves can be removed or erased by secondary electron
emission.

Elastomers can be used inside the vacuum tubes without impacting
the life of the cathode or the electron beam environment.
Prototypes of the modulator have been developed and plans are in
place to build an electron beam-addressed projector.  The
development cost is anticipated to be lower than devices using
active matrix addressing.

Processing Display

The Vista Pro high-brightness projector, the first system based on
Texas Instrument's three chip engine tradenamed Digital Light
Processing, has been introduced by Electrochrome Projection Systems
(Kitchener, Ontario).  The new projector is capable of 1000 ANSI
lumens of brightness, 24-bit color, digital accuracy and
scalability to higher resolutions.

The system is supported by menu-driven control software,
compatibility with many signal sources, and easy set-up.  It also
has a graphical interface, a hand-held remote, and is easy to
operate.  The DLP subsystem eliminates the need for electrical or
mechanical realignment or convergence of the red, green and blue

Philips Licenses
Light-Emitting Polymer

Philips Components B.V. is the first licensee for a new light-
emitting polymer (LEP) display technique developed by Cambridge
Display Technology Ltd. (CDT), Cambridge, England.  CDT is in
discussions with other major companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia
and expects to make a second announcement concerning a European
company soon.  It has placed manufacturing plans on hold, however,
in favor of a licensing technology.

Philips will pay CDT an upfront licensing fee together with a
royalty on every LEP product it sells, in return for a non-
exclusive right to use the patented technology.  The companies
would not discuss financial details of the agreement which does not
cover any technology transfer.  Philips was already working on LEPs
independently so the agreement should help the company
commercialize devices and develop manufacturing techniques.

Mark Gostick, CDT business development manager, said he expected
that a licensee would commercialize the LEP technology within the
next two years.  CDT plans to build a prototype color-graphics
screen by the end of the decade.

The new emphasis on licensing has scrapped CDT's original plans for
a pilot plant with Xyratex Ltd. (Havant, U.K.).  "We are not going
into manufacturing," said Danny Chapchal, CEO.  "Shortly after I
came on board, it became sensible to pursue a licensing and
technology transfer strategy as the best way to accelerate
introduction of LEP technology.

Philips is not saying how quickly it will use its new license.
"Philips is a major player in displays, and as such we explore all
new technologies," said Robert-Jan Visser, head of polymers and
organic chemistry at Philips Research Labs (Eindhoven, the
Netherlands), which has been working on LEP technology for more
than three years.  "But we do think this technology has a lot to
offer."  The advantages include high luminous efficiency and simple
physical construction.  Since the materials used are plastics, they
should be easier to manufacture.

CDT hopes the technology will find an early, high-volume
application such as a backlight for LCDs.  The revenue generated
from this could help develop high resolution displays.

Lucent Donates
$2M in Equipment

Lucent Technologies recently announced the donation of $2 million
in display manufacturing equipment to the Liquid Crystal Institute.
The gift gives Kent State the distinction of being the first
university in the U.S. to house a complete display manufacturing
line.  The equipment was part of an LCD manufacturing pilot line at
Bell Labs, the R&D arm of Lucent Technologies.

"We believe that this donation will help Kent State University
continue to make important contributions to the advancement of
liquid crystal technology for the benefit of all U.S. industry,"
said Bill Brinkman, executive director of physical sciences and
engineering at Bell Labs.

The pilot line will be transferred to the Institute's new $13.2
million headquarters which will be completed this fall.  "Bell Labs
has a long and distinguished record of liquid crystal research.
Kent State University is honored and enormously grateful to receive
a donation of this importance from Lucent Technologies," said

Bell Labs used the equipment to develop a better understanding of
display design and manufacturing capabilities and constraints.
University and State of Ohio officials believe that the pilot line,
when combined with technologies under development at the LCI, holds
the potential to enhance manufacturing in Northeast Ohio.  There

Micron Reports
Income Decline

Micron Technology Inc. (Boise, Idaho) reported net income of $593
million, or $2.76 per fully diluted share, on net sales of $3,654
million for the fiscal year ended Aug. 29, 1996.  Fiscal 1995's net
income was $844 million, or $3.90 per fully diluted share, on net
sales of $2,953 million.  Net income for fiscal 1996 declined 30%
from 1995 as the semiconductor memory business was impacted by
sharp declines in average selling prices.

Micron Technology Inc. and its subsidiaries manufacture DRAMs,
SRAMs, FLASH and other semiconductor memory components, remote
intelligent communications (RIC) products, complex printed circuit
board assemblies, field emissive displays, and personal computer
systems.

Fiscal 1996 results were adversely affected by a one-time $30
million pre-tax restructuring charge for discontinuing sales of
ZEOS brand PC systems and closing related PC manufacturing
operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the second fiscal quarter.
The restructuring charge reduced 1996 fully diluted earnings per
share by approximately $0.11.

The company's net sales increased 24% in fiscal 1996 compared to
fiscal 1995 as a result of growth in personal computer sales and a
significant increase in megabits of semiconductor memory sold.  PC
system sales increased primarily due to greater acceptance of
Micron brand desktop systems, a higher level of government sales,
and an increase in sales of notebook systems.  The effect on net
sales of the increase in megabits of semiconductor memory produced
was offset by a severe decline (over 75%) in average selling prices
for semiconductor memory.

Steve Appleton, chairman, president and CEO, commented on the
fiscal 1996 results, saying, "We are extremely proud of our team's
outstanding efforts resulting in the second most profitable year in
the company's history.  The execution of the conversion to 8-in.
wafer processing and the transition to the 16 Meg DRAM as our
primary product has been phenomenal.  The emergence of Micron
Electronics as a major competitor in the personal computer direct
sales channel is additionally a significant accomplishment."

Bacteria Form
Display Mask

Astralux Inc. (Boulder, CO), is using bacteria to make quantum
boxes for thin flat panel displays.  Some kinds of bacteria produce
a protein layer that contains an array of identically shaped pores.
Following harvest, this protein layer can be used to make a ceramic
mask for producing silicon boxes.  The array of boxes, patterned by
the mask, is identical and cylindrical.  The pores, and the boxes,
can have diameters from 0.3-10.0 nm depending upon which bacterial
species is used.  Astralux has made 2-nm quantum boxes and
fabricated preliminary electroluminescent (EL) devices.  They also
used the protein layer of bacteria to form a nanostructured
titanium oxide mask with lattice spacing of the holes at 20 nm.

The Ballistic Missile Defense Org. (BMDO) funded this work as part
of its Nanotechnology: Products for the Material World program.
BMDO nanotechnology research focuses on the very small world of
products that are being created using materials or techniques 100
nanometers or less.

Silicon is a good material for this flat panel display project
since it can emit white light, a mixture of all visible light, when
activated optically or electrically.  The masks make silicon
quantum boxes with a uniform size and shape, which can't be done
with porous silicon.  The confinement of the box narrows the
emission spectrum so different colors are emitted by different size
boxes.  This makes the light emission tunable and makes possible
full-color displays.

Astralux is seeking partners to continue its Small Business
Industrial Research (SBIR) funding for the development of
prototypes.

Future Displays
May Be Switched

Researchers at Deacon Research (2440 Embarcadaro Way Palo Alto, CA
94303; Tel: 415/493-6100) have invented a brand new way to
construct flat panel displays.  The display is based on a new
switching technology for routing laser light among a set of optical
waveguides and coupling the light toward the viewer.  Essentially,
the device is an electrically-switchable mirror.  The novel
switching method is based on poled domains established in electro-
optical crystals, such as lithium niobate.  Using this technology,
Deacon claims that both miniature high resolution displays and
large screen display for television formats can be manufactured.

Problems with existing waveguide flat panel display technology are
that compact high resolution displays can not be fabricated due to
the large pixel spacing, inefficient "waveguide taps" limit the
brightness of the display, the power efficiency is low because of
the optical losses, and power cannot be efficiently switched into
another waveguide.

The electrically-controlled switching element is a poled grating,
consisting of alternating poled domains of opposite sign in the
electro-optical crystal.  Within the poled domains of a
ferroelectric crystal such as lithium niobate the electric dipoles
are aligned in the poling direction.  The pattern of poled domains
may be established using an electric field, in-diffusion, or ion-
exchange.

After the poled domains are a set of waveguides fabricated in or on
the substrate.  Typically for lithium niobate, annealed proton
exchange is used to fabricate waveguide structures in the substrate
volume.  The waveguides traverse (are not parallel to) the poled
gratings.  Electrodes are laid to control the gratings; when an
electric field is applied across the grating structure, the
refractive index of the grating region is modulated, depending upon
the direction of the domain poling.

The poled region must extent far enough into the substrate to
interact with the light propagating through the waveguide.  When
the field is off, the refractive index is not modulated, and the
propagating light is not affected.  The propagating beam can be
coupled to another element of the same substrate, or it can become
an output beam toward the observer.  An antireflection coating is
applied at the output point.  The refractive index grating
structures may be tuned by a number of methods.  Further details
can be found in U.S. Patent 5,544,268.

According to Dave Deacon, president of Deacon Research, Deacon
Research recently formed a new company to spin-off this technology
and develop products for market.

Plastic Emits
Laser Light

Several years ago, scientists in Cambridge, England, discovered
that a plastic called PPV gives off light when electricity passes
through it.  This material is one type of polymer that is being
developed as light emitting diodes (LEDs) for use in displays.  Now
that it has produced laser light, the material has proven itself to
be good for light emission, a fact that was questioned by some in
the scientific community, according to Richard H. Friend of the
Cavendish Lab in Cambridge.

To achieve this feat, scientists sandwiched the PPV between two
mirrors.  They consisted of a thin silver film and a layered
material called a distributed Bragg reflector, which reflects
visible light with nearly 100% efficiency.  This kind of device
produces light by stimulated emission.  Shining light through the
reflector causes the PPV to emit photons, some of which are
reflected back and forth between the mirrors which starts a cascade
of more photons.  These photons are not reflected but pass through
the silver film.  They have a single wavelength and are in phase,
thus forming the coherent laser beam.

Although the emitted light was a yellow-green color, polymer laser
light could cover a range of visible wavelengths according to the
Cambridge researchers.  The next step is to develop polymer lasers
that can be excited by electricity rather than light.

A key driver in the use of this material for displays is the fact
that it can be easily deposited over large areas which comes in
handy when making large, flat LED panels such as billboards or even
computer screens.

Work Progresses on
Retinal Displays

At the University of Washington's Human Interface Technology Lab
(Seattle, WA), researchers funded by Microvision Inc., a Seattle-
based electro-optics company, are developing the ability to create
"virtual retinal displays."  Images are projected pixel by pixel,
or point of light by point of light, from an outside source
directly onto the retina of a viewer's eye.

These kinds of displays allow viewers to see information on what
appears to be a translucent computer screen hanging a few feet in
front of them.  The reality is that there is no screen--the image
exists only inside the eye.  Application examples abound.  Surgeons
will be able to call up high-resolution x-rays of patients as they
lie on an operating table and, in the military, soldiers will be
able to use virtual displays to see mines as they are projected
from helmet mounted, ground penetrating radar.

Support for this technology is strong as research continues.
Microvision hopes to eventually mount a retinal scanning device on
a platform as small as an eyeglass frame.  Prototypes should be
available within two years.

University of Washington researchers are working on ways to project
almost a million pixels on the retina (300,000 each of red, blue
and green), one pixel at a time, thus creating 60 full retinal
screens, or images, each second.  Anything less will cause flicker.
The lab currently has a table-top retinal display apparatus, which
uses gas lasers or laser diodes that create laser light beams, to
break down video images into green, blue and red streams of light.
The light streams are then manipulated by the system's electronics
and combined using a series of mirrors and lenses onto a fiber
optic cable.

Following this, the merged beam is channeled to small horizontal
and vertical scanners that "paint" the image onto the retina.  The
viewer sees a high-resolution image that appears to be focused
several feet in the distance.  In addition, the display can be
projected from a hand-held device onto the retina.  In that
instance, however, the image appears to originate inside the
device.

CRTs have created an image pixel by pixel to create images.  What's
different in the virtual display is beaming light directly onto the
retina to create pixels that form an image.  According to the
researchers, the retinal display produces a brighter, higher-
resolution image that the CRT or LCDs.  Since the image comes from
low intensity lasers, it doesn't damage the eye.

The Army seems eager to start testing these displays.  The Pentagon
has been funding LCDs and other flat panel technologies for three
years, but a retinal display presents the possibility of higher
resolution at the same cost.  And, since they are virtual
projections, virtual displays don't block the viewer's forward
vision.  Microvision seems to be targeting the high-end military
and medical markets.  Estimated costs of these displays is placed
between $5,000 and $50,000 each.

Polymer Makes
All Plastic Electrodes

Al-Coat Ltd. (Ness-Ziona, Israel) has developed a process in which
a conductive transparent polymer is applied as an electrode in a
PDLC device.  So far, the new polymer has been a successful
substitute for indium tin oxide (ITO).

In the process, two PET substrates, approximately 200-microns
thick, are each coated on the inside with 100 nm of the conductive
polymer thus building "all plastic" transparent electrodes.  The
PDLC layer in the middle is separated from the electrodes on both
sides by a 0.5-um thick electric insulating layer.  The electro-
optical properties of this device match those of the conventional
ITO-based devices.

The all plastic electrodes provide mechanical flexibility to the
device and reduce electrical current in the on-state.  This
condition implies a low energy consumption when the device is
turned on.

Selective Ion
Source Developed

A scientist at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has developed a new selective ion source
that improves the semiconductor manufacturing process and could
decrease the cost of flat-panel displays.  The inventor of the new
process is Ka-Ngo Leung, leader of the Plasma and Ion Source
Technology Group in the Lab's Accelerator and Fusion Research
Division.  "Although the new technology can help improve the
manufacture of conventional silicon-based semiconductors,"  Leung
says "its primary application will be the manufacture of flat-panel
displays.

 Leung's solution to a variety of manufacturing problems was to
develop an ion source technology that uses just enough energy to
selectively ionize only the phosphine (PH3) (or diborine, B2H6, or
other gas), but not enough to ionize the hydrogen gas.  This
eliminates most of the unwanted impurities from the ion stream
because they are electrically neutral, and reduces both excess
heating and the charging problem.

Flat-panel displays consist of many pixels, each of which is
controlled by transistors,  Leung said.  The transistors are formed
from semiconductors consisting of silicon doped with phosphorus or
boron.  One way to dope a layer of silicon with phosphorus, arsenic
or boron ions is to aim a stream of dopant ions into the silicon,
a process called ion implantation.

He went on to explain that the manufacturing process must ensure
that the dopant is pure and as free as possible from unwanted ions.
Conventional implantation might start with a beam of phosphorus or
boron scanning the silicon wafer to dope it uniformly.  However,
flat panel displays start with a panel of glass that is too big to
use the conventional method effectively.  So, a technique called
ion shower is used, which employs large beam of phosphorus or
boron.  The panel is immersed in the shower, which implants the
entire panel with the dopant, requiring a large ion source.

The source generates a stream of dopant ions such as phosphorus
using the phosphorus-containing gas.  However, phosphine is so
toxic that it is always sold heavily diluted, often in a mixture of
95% hydrogen gas and 5% phosphine.  Used as a conventional ion
source most of the ions coming out are hydrogen, creating two
problems.  One is that the energy of the beam is so high that the
silicon-coated glass blank is heated too much by the accelerated
hydrogen ions causing damage to the glass surface.  A second
problem is damage caused by the buildup of excessive electrical
charges in the plate from the unwanted ions.

The new technology solves yet another problem.  Conventional
sources use a tungsten filament to inject the gas with electrons.
However the tungsten is an impurity that is easy to ionize, a
source of contamination.  So the researchers inject electrons using
a principle called radio frequency (RF) induction discharge.  "We
create plasma using RF induction discharge and then inject
electrons into the main chamber to ionize the source gas," he says.
"The device is called an RF plasma cathode."

 Leung also has another invention which consists of an apparatus
for creating a large-diameter ion beam from a small-diameter
diverging beam.  In conjunction with the selective ion source, this
invention can be used to generate a beam appropriate for ion
implantation of large areas of material such as those used in flat-
panel displays.

Developmental work on the selective ion source is supported by a
corporate sponsor under a cooperative research and development
agreement with DOE.  The University of California was awarded U.S.
patent number 5,517,084 for  Leung's selective ionization
invention.  Patents are pending for his RF plasma cathode and large
diameter ion beam apparatus.  The three patents are available for
licensing from Berkeley Lab's Technology Transfer Department.

Electrochemical
Etching Perfected

A new electrochemical etching-based method of making silicon
carbide (SiC) semiconductor optoelectronic devices has been
developed by scientists at NASA's Lewis Research Center (21000
Brookpark Rd., Cleveland, OH 44135; Tel: 216/433-5568, Fax:
216/433-3344).  The technique, reports Joseph S. Shor, who
performed the work for NASA, may facilitate the building of
ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, ultraviolet lasers, blue
electroluminescent devices, and filters for solid state chemical
sensors.  The electrochemical etching method provides for the
formation of selected porous regions with variable macrostructures,
microstructures, and compositions in SiC wafers.

In the NASA process, a SiC wafer is mounted in a carrier with a
nickel electrical contact and covered with black wax everywhere
except for an opening at the designated surface location of the
region to be made porous.  The wax prevents etching everywhere
except at the exposed area.  The carrier is placed on a pedestal in
a polytetrafluoroethylene vessel filled with an etching solution of
dilute (normally 2.5%) hydrofluoric acid.  A saturated calomel
electrode and a platinum wire counter-electrode are immersed in the
solution,  Through the nickel contact, a variable voltage DC power
supply circuit applies a bias voltage to the wafer.  A control
circuit maintains the bias at a prescribed voltage with respect to
the saturated calomel electrode.

If, for example, the SiC is doped with electron donor atoms (n-
doped), the exposed surface of the wafer is illuminated through a
sapphire window at the top of the vessel, while the SiC is
maintained at an anodic potential of 1.8-2.8 volts to promote
photoinduced corrosion.  If the SiC is doped with electron
acceptors (p-doped), it can be etched in the dark at 0-2 volts.
The depth and structure of the porous region is determined by
factors such as the anodization time, the applied potential, the
intensity of the ultraviolet light (if used), the pH of the
solution, and the concentration of the dopant.

In the fabrication of a SiC p/n-junction diode supported by a
broad, electrically insulating substrate, for example, engineers
can take advantage of the fact that porous SiC may be oxidized to
silicon dioxide (SiO2) at a rate much greater than that of solid
SiC, because the pores present a much greater surface area for
oxidation.

A wafer is fabricated by the chemical vapor deposition of a p-doped
SiC epilayer, and then an n-doped SiC epilayer on an n-doped SiC
substrate.  A mask is placed on the top n-doped epilayer and then
patterned photolithographically.  The electrochemical etching
method makes the part of the n-doped epilayer not covered by the
mask porous and, as a result, highly susceptible to oxidation.

The resulting porous part of the layer is oxidized to SiO2 to make
it highly susceptible to etching using hydrofluoric acid.  It is
then etched, leaving a mesa of n-doped SiC.  The electrochemical
etching method is then used again, this time with process
conditions selected to impart porosity to the exposed part of the
p-doped SiC.  Then the porous material is oxidized to SiO2, leaving
a 2-layer, n-doped/p-doped mesa. The electrochemical etching
technique is then applied, this time under process conditions that
impart porosity to the n-doped SiC substrate only.  Finally, the
porous substrate is oxidized to SiO2, which is electrically
insulating.

Contract to Develop
Storage System

The U.S. Display Consortium (USDC) awarded a contract to PRI
Automation (Billerica, MA) to develop an automated storage and
retrieval system for work-in-process for flat panel display
manufacturing.  The USDC will fund $820,000 of the $1.6 billion
total cost.

PRI will develop a stocker system that will store work-in-process
cassettes or pods vertically in units up to 12 ft. high.  The goal
is to more efficiently utilize cleanroom space that is presently
occupied by carts and storage racks.  Each stocker will feature a
high-lift capacity robot to store and retrieve cassettes under host
or operator control.  The stockers will be designed to operate in
a Class 10 cleanroom environment.

PRI's stockers will accommodate all standard cassette and pod sizes
being developed under other USDC contracts, including the next
generation 600 x 720 mm glass size, and they will be compatible
with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Manual Guided Vehicles
(MGVs) and host communications software specified by the USDC
project team.  The USDC and PRI previously collaborated on the
development of a standard laser marking and tracking system.

MKS Intros Mass
Flow Controller

MKS Instruments (Andover, MA) introduced a new pressure-based mass
flow controller, known as the Type 1153, designed to provide
precise delivery of vapors from complex solids and liquids with
vapor pressures as low as 2.5 Torr at temperatures as high as
200C.  The flow of vapor is controlled via a pressure-based
technique using two pressure transducers tradenamed Baratron, a
choked flow nozzle and a high temperature solenoid valve.  An
onboard CPU provides control of flow from the choked, to the non-
choked regions of flow, providing a wide usable control range.
Full scale flow is process dependent, but can range up to 10 slm.
Both flow temperatures are controlled via 0-5 V analog signals or
RS-232.

The MKS Type 1153 allows microelectronics/semiconductor, and flat
panel display manufacturers to deliver low vapor pressure liquid
and solid precursors to a CVD chamber to deposit barrier, high k
and low k dielectric films.
