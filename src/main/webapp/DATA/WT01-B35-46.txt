<h3>Foreword </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are experiences that most of us are hesitant
to speak about, because they do not conform to everyday reality
and defy rational explanation. These are not particular external
occurrences, but rather events of our inner lives, which are
generally dismissed as figments of the imagination and barred
from our memory. Suddenly, the familiar view of our surroundings
is transformed in a strange, delightful, or alarming way: it
appears to us in a new light, takes on a special meaning. Such an
experience can be as light and fleeting as a breath of air, or it
can imprint itself deeply upon our minds. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One enchantment of that kind, which I experienced
in childhood, has remained remarkably vivid in my memory ever
since. It happened on a May morning&#151;I have forgotten the
year&#151;but I can still point to the exact spot where it
occurred, on a forest path on Martinsberg above Baden,
Switzerland. As I strolled through the freshly greened woods
filled with bird song and lit up by the morning sun, all at once
everything appeared in an uncommonly clear light. Was this
something I had simply failed to notice before? Was I suddenly
discovering the spring forest as it actually looked? It shone
with the most beautiful radiance, speaking to the heart, as
though it wanted to encompass me in its majesty. I was filled
with an indescribable sensation of joy, oneness, and blissful
security. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no idea how long I stood there spellbound.
But I recall the anxious concern I felt as the radiance slowly
dissolved and I hiked on: how could a vision that was so real and
convincing, so directly and deeply felt&#151;how could it end so
soon? And how could I tell anyone about it, as my overflowing joy
compelled me to do, since I knew there were no words to describe
what I had seen? It seemed strange that I, as a child, had seen
something so marvelous, something that adults obviously did not
perceive - for I had never heard them mention it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While still a child, I experienced several more of
these deeply euphoric moments on my rambles through forest and
meadow. It was these experiences that shaped the main outlines of
my world view and convinced me of the existence of a miraculous,
powerful, unfathomable reality that was hidden from everyday
sight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was often troubled in those days, wondering if I
would ever, as an adult, be able to communicate these
experiences; whether I would have the chance to depict my visions
in poetry or paintings. But knowing that I was not cut out to be
a poet or artist, I assumed I would have to keep these
experiences to myself, important as they were to me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unexpectedly&#151;though scarcely by
chance&#151;much later, in middle age, a link was established
between my profession and these visionary experiences from
childhood. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because I wanted to gain insight into the structure
and essence of matter, I became a research chemist. Intrigued by
the plant world since early childhood, I chose to specialize in
research on the constituents of medicinal plants. In the course
of this career I was led to the psychoactive,
hallucination-causing substances, which under certain conditions
can evoke visionary states similar to the spontaneous experiences
just described. The most important of these hallucinogenic
substances has come to be known as LSD. Hallucinogens, as active
compounds of considerable scientific interest, have gained entry
into medicinal research, biology, and psychiatry, and
later&#151;especially LSD also obtained wide diffusion in the
drug culture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In studying the literature connected with my work,
I became aware of the great universal significance of visionary
experience. It plays a dominant role, not only in mysticism and
the history of religion, but also in the creative process in art,
literature, and science. More recent investigations have shown
that many persons also have visionary experiences in daily life,
though most of us fail to recognize their meaning and value.
Mystical experiences, like those that marked my childhood, are
apparently far from rare. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is today a widespread striving for mystical
experience, for visionary breakthroughs to a deeper, more
comprehensive reality than that perceived by our rational,
everyday consciousness. Efforts to transcend our materialistic
world view are being made in various ways, not only by the
adherents to Eastern religious movements, but also by
professional psychiatrists, who are adopting such profound
spiritual experiences as a basic therapeutic principle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I share the belief of many of my contemporaries
that the spiritual crisis pervading all spheres of Western
industrial society can be remedied only by a change in our world
view. We shall have to shift from the materialistic, dualistic
belief that people and their environment are separate, toward a
new consciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embraces
the experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their
oneness with animate nature and all of creation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything that can contribute to such a
fundamental alteration in our perception of reality must
therefore command earnest attention. Foremost among such
approaches are the various methods of meditation, either in a
religious or a secular context, which aim to deepen the
consciousness of reality by way of a total mystical experience.
Another important, but still controversial, path to the same goal
is the use of the consciousness-altering properties of
hallucinogenic psychopharmaceuticals. LSD finds such an
application in medicine, by helping patients in psychoanalysis
and psychotherapy to perceive their problems in their true
significance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deliberate provocation of mystical experience,
particularly by LSD and related hallucinogens, in contrast to
spontaneous visionary experiences, entails dangers that must not
be underestimated. Practitioners must take into account the
peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to
influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.
The history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic
consequences that can ensue when its profound effect is misjudged
and the substance is mistaken for a pleasure drug. Special
internal and external advance preparations are required; with
them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful experience. Wrong
and inappropriate use has caused LSD to become my problem child. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is my desire in this book to give a
comprehensive picture of LSD, its origin, its effects, and its
dangers, in order to guard against increasing abuse of this
extraordinary drug. I hope thereby to emphasize possible uses of
LSD that are compatible with its characteristic action. I believe
that if people would learn to use LSD's vision-inducing
capability more wisely, under suitable conditions, in medical
practice and in conjunction with meditation, then in the future
this problem child could become a wonder child. </p>
