<H2>Chapter 1: Ensure a Competitive, Clean, and Secure Energy Future </H2>
<HR>
Our Nation's progress depends on our ability to use energy resources in ways that help the economy grow, protect the environment, and keep our Nation secure. A sustainable energy policy improves our standard of living today and expands future opportunities by maximizing energy productivity, preventing pollution, and reducing our vulnerability to global energy disruptions.<BR>

<P>
Each day, Americans depend on the benefits of energy, usually without considering the role that energy plays in our quality of life. Absent an energy crisis-lines at the gas pump or sudden blackouts-few Americans think about how national energy policy helps to improve our economy, our environment, or  our national security.<BR>

<p>
But energy is fundamental to progress, and energy policy is crucial for three main reasons: energy fuels a competitive economy, energy utilization affects the environment, and energy use may affect our national security. The need for a rational and forward-looking energy policy does not disappear when our attention to energy wanes. Indeed, a time of relative stability offers a significant opportunity to build a sustainable national energy policy-one that recognizes the links between the economy and the environment, considers the future impacts of today's decisions, and promotes investment to enhance future opportunities. As our experience with several energy crises and our ongoing concerns for the environment attest, the future does not always take care of itself. Smart policy decisions can make a difference in how well we realize our national goals.<BR>

<p>
Since January 1993, the Clinton Administration has been developing and implementing a sustainable energy policy-one that delivers real benefits to our citizens today and that expands opportunities for future generations. The Administration's policy is informed by the successes and the failures of 20 years of Federal efforts to respond to immediate energy crises. But in contrast to past approaches, the Administration has adopted a longer run perspective to fashion policy that addresses the economic, environmental, and security risks that our Nation will continue to face in the next century.<BR>

<p>
<H4><a NAME ="1.1">Energy Policy and Everyday Life</a></H4>

National energy policy affects each American every day. Consider four examples from everyday life: turning on the lights at home, filling up the tank at the gas station, adjusting a thermostat in the office, and starting a motor on the assembly line. How does energy policy affect us in these ordinary activities?<BR>

<p>

Although residential customers turning on the lights need not know whether the electricity is produced from coal, nuclear power, natural gas, or windpower, the rates they pay and the quality of the air they breathe reflect policies that influence the electric utility's choice of fuels, generating technologies, and investments in pollution controls. Sometime in the future, their bills could change as a result of proposed market reforms that could allow customers to choose their electricity supplier in the way that they choose long-distance telephone service-but analysts disagree about whether residential electric rates will rise as a result or whether competition will help keep prices down.<BR>

<p>

A motorist filling the tank may remember waiting in gas lines during the 1970s and may recall the shock of having to pay sharply rising prices for gasoline. But many people do not realize that in real terms (compared with the prices of other goods) gasoline prices now are at their lowest level since World War II, due in part to government actions to decontrol oil prices that began in the late 1970s. The gasoline the motorist is pumping was likely derived from imported crude oil, given that imports now constitute roughly half of domestic oil consumption.1,2 A decade of low world oil prices has benefited consumers but has hurt domestic oil producers and halved employment in this industry. At the same time, government regulation has spawned impressive technological advances: to drive a mile, the average motorist now uses about 60 percent of the gasoline he or she used 20 years ago, and that mile of travel now emits a minute fraction of the tailpipe emissions produced then. However, increased driving has kept gasoline consumption-and oil imports-steadily growing and has limited progress in reducing overall air pollution.<BR>

<p>

An office worker probably is unaware that many commercial building owners have invested heavily in energy-efficient heating, air-conditioning, and lighting systems that have improved working conditions while drastically lowering energy bills. Many of the new technologies-such as more thermally efficient windows-resulted from federally funded research and development efforts. Much of this investment has occurred because some regulated utilities were allowed to make a profit by helping building owners reduce energy consumption, often aided by government programs that helped owners and tenants gauge the economic benefits of energy-efficient investments.<BR>

<p>

Finally, the assembly line worker might not know that industrial motors use more than 20 percent of the electricity generated in the United States, even though current electric motors are vastly more efficient than those used just a decade ago. The company might be considering entering into a partnership with the Department of Energy to install more efficient equipment, both to save money and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Maybe the firm also is considering generating its own electricity with process waste heat-but has shelved the plan until new rules of the market grow out of regulatory reform efforts. Or perhaps the company is examining new pollution prevention ideas, hoping to save money on environmental compliance costs if environmental rules grant it more flexibility in choosing the means of reaching pollution reduction goals.<BR>

<p>

<H4><a name="1.2">Energy and National Progress</H4></a>

The preceding examples illustrate the intrinsic importance of energy in everyday life and, when multiplied to the scale of the entire economy, how energy policy can affect our national well-being. They also reveal some of the dynamic changes that are occurring below the surface in many energy markets, some of which may accelerate in the coming years. And they vividly illuminate the three basic reasons why Americans need to be concerned about energy: our economy depends on energy, energy production and use can damage the environment, and current patterns of energy use may affect national security.<BR>

<p>

<H4><a name="1.3">Energy Fuels a Competitive Economy</H4></a>

Our standard of living and industrial productivity require reliable and competitively priced energy. In 1993, American businesses and consumers directly spent $505 billion per year on energy, or about 8 percent of the gross domestic product. Industrial facilities purchased $121 billion worth of energy every year, while the average family spent more than $2,000 per year on utility, transportation, and other fuels. At $56 billion per year, energy imports accounted for almost 10 percent of total product imports. On the other side of the ledger, U.S. firms export billions of dollars worth of energy technology, sustaining thousands of high-paying domestic jobs.<BR>

<p>

Several aspects of our energy use pose risks to our economy. Some energy markets do not perform efficiently-leading consumers and firms to spend too much money and waste energy resources. Low world oil prices have led not only to a surge in oil imports that could make some sectors vulnerable to oil price increases, but also to a major decline in the domestic oil industry. Low energy prices also have blunted the incentive to conduct long-term research to develop new, more efficient technologies that will improve the economics of energy use in the future. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a NAME ="1.4">Energy Affects the Quality of the Environment</H4></a>

The United States has made significant strides in reducing the environmental impact of energy use, relying on a regulatory system that focuses on specific energy technologies such as powerplants and automobiles. For example, although the use of fossil fuels increased 13 percent from 1975 to 1993, emissions of sulfur dioxide decreased by 22 percent and emissions of lead decreased by 97 percent. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 will further reduce many air pollutants from fossil fuel use, such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, which contribute to acid rain.<BR>

<p>

Despite the progress made in reducing some energy-related emissions, other pollutants have remained difficult and expensive to address under the existing regulatory structure and with current technology. Many of our large urban areas continue to experience regional haze and smog as a result of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted from energy use. Increasing energy use threatens to erode the progress made under the Nation's current environmental control system, while new environmental risks are emerging, such as the potential for global energy use to contribute to climate change. Increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases due to rising carbon dioxide and methane emissions from energy use are likely to alter the Earth's climate system, although scientists do not agree on the timing and nature of potential climate changes or on the scope and severity of the problems associated with a changing climate system.<BR>

<p>

To make additional progress on reducing environmental risks, the Nation needs new, more cost-effective approaches to address the problems we have already tackled, as well as innovative methods to counter emerging risks. We must develop new technologies for preventing pollution and must harness market forces more effectively in an effort to improve the U.S. and global environment.<BR>

<p>

<H4><a NAME ="1.5">Energy Affects National Security</H4></a>

Because the United States relies on oil for more than 40 percent of its energy needs, disruptions in world oil markets can have serious economic and national security implications. Energy policy has reduced, but not eliminated, the risks from relying heavily on global oil supplies concentrated in potentially unstable regions of the world. <BR>

<p>

In 1994, about 50 percent of the oil consumed in the United States was imported, a figure that could rise to more than 60 percent by 2010 according to the Energy Information Administration. By 2010, two-thirds of the oil traded on the international market will originate in the Persian Gulf, an area that has experienced conflict in recent years. <BR>

<p>

The experience of the past 20 years suggests that the international oil market is prone to disruptions and price shocks and that macroeconomic policies may aggravate the adverse effects on the U.S. economy. Even though domestic and international energy markets operate much more efficiently than was the case 20 years ago, the United States still faces economic and security risks from current patterns of oil consumption and production.<BR>

<p>

<H4><a NAME ="1.6">Goals of Sustainable Energy Policy</H4></a>

Although everyone has a stake in the energy future, energy policy tends to receive national attention only in crisis situations. But policies fashioned in response to a crisis tend to focus narrowly on the immediate predicament, while failing to recognize and deal effectively with the underlying cause of the crisis itself.<BR>

<p>

Certainly energy policy should aim to avoid crises. But energy policy should also address risks that threaten to undercut progress over the long term. Because energy is so deeply intertwined with everyday life, energy policy is a tool that can help our economy grow, improve our environment, and enhance national security today, while protecting us from future threats. This is the basis for a sustainable energy policy.<BR>

<p>

Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In some cases, competitive markets meet the criteria of sustainability, while in other cases markets fall short.<BR>

<p>

Where energy markets fall short of sustainability-where they fail to adequately protect the environment, where they do not generate sufficient progress in science and technology, where they do not recognize fully the economic and security risks of certain elements in the overall energy picture-energy policy can help ensure sustainable economic progress.<BR>

<p>

Sustainable development policy also reflects a long-term perspective that helps balance the short-term orientation of private markets. We currently enjoy the benefits of actions taken decades ago-investments in science, technology development, environmental protection, and national security-and we have an obligation to provide future generations with a foundation to realize greater progress.<BR>

<p>

To pursue the overall objective of sustainable development, the Clinton Administration's energy policy has three strategic goals:

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Maximize Energy Productivity to strengthen our economy and improve living standards. Getting more out of the energy we use will keep costs of energy services such as light, heat, and mobility at levels that our citizens can afford and at which our businesses can thrive. And as we develop new technologies to increase energy productivity, we can seize global market opportunities in technology exports, creating high-paying jobs and improving the Nation's balance of trade.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Prevent Pollution to reduce the adverse environmental impacts associated with energy production, delivery, and use. Americans cherish a clean environment, and we have made tremendous strides in improving the quality of our land, air, and water. However, as U.S. and global energy needs grow, we must continue to press for more cost-effective and less polluting ways to produce and use energy and explore new approaches to reduce environmental risks, keep our economy strong, and maintain our global leadership in protecting the environment.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Keep America Secure by reducing our exposure to events beyond our control. The United States depends on reliable and competitively priced energy supplies to fuel stable economic growth. However, our economy relies on oil for 40 percent of our energy needs, which are being met increasingly by potentially unstable sources of world oil supply. While existing energy policy and improved macroeconomic policies can help reduce the economic harm from supply disruptions, our economy continues to be vulnerable to oil price shocks.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

Sustainable energy policy pursues all three goals, because actions that further one goal at the expense of the others can increase the economic, environmental, or security risks borne by future generations. These goals have guided the Administration in developing a sustainable energy policy.<BR>

<p>

<H4><a NAME ="1.7">Delivering on the Goals: Energy Policy for a Sustainable Future</H4></a>

Although market limitations warrant policy action in some cases, sustainable energy policy should not displace market forces or impair well-functioning markets. In fact, market forces can be powerful tools to promote sustainable development. Where markets are not maximizing energy productivity, adequately protecting the environment, or reflecting national security considerations, Administration policy tries to align market forces with the goals of sustainable development. These efforts yield immediate and significant benefits for consumers and firms and lay the foundation for sustained progress.<BR>

<p>

The Administration's long-term energy strategy focuses on advancing technologies to promote a transition toward more sustainable energy systems. Over time, the state of technology exerts enormous leverage on how energy affects the Nation's economy, environment, and security. In the coming decades, our quality of life will depend significantly on the scientific and technological advances supported by today's energy policies.<BR>

<p>

Government can play a positive role in improving markets and stimulating technological advances in a variety of energy sectors. Specific policies must be tailored to the unique circumstances of the markets-whether they be the markets that supply energy, the economic sectors that use energy, or the markets that provide the technologies of energy production and use. Policies must also reflect lessons learned from previous failures, whether they were counterproductive regulatory approaches or ill-advised technology development projects. Finally, policies must take advantage of the unique capabilities of State and local governments, communities, and the private sector. Although national energy policy requires an active Federal role, many of the programs and activities are conducted at the State and local level or with private firms that generate immediate and local benefits.<BR>

<p>

The Administration has initiated a wide range of programs to attain the goals of sustainable national energy policy. These programs, described in subsequent chapters, reflect five key strategies:

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Increase the Efficiency of Energy Use <a href="ch3a.html"> (Chapter 3)</a>. Efficient resource use is a fundamental tenet of sustainable development. The economic, environmental, and national security implications of inefficient energy use motivate market and technology programs that help energy consumers find the most efficient ways to use energy and to maximize energy productivity and value. The Administration is committed to improving energy efficiency in all critical market segments-commercial and residential buildings, transportation, industry, utilities, and government.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Develop a Balanced Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio <a href="ch4a.html">(Chapter 4)</a>. Markets that provide critical energy resources for the Nation must also attain our national economic, environmental, and security goals. The Administration is committed to enhancing the competitiveness of domestic oil producers, expanding the role of clean, efficient, and domestically produced natural gas, encouraging the continued development of renewable energy resources, reducing the environmental impacts of coal, and maintaining the safe contribution of nuclear energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Invest in Science and Technology Advances<a href="ch5.html"> (Chapter 5)</a>. Technological progress enables us to improve the efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts of producing, transporting, and consuming energy. Markets tend to underprovide the resources for science and technology development in sectors where immediate returns are not evident or where benefits are not captured fully by those who invest in research or development. The Administration's science and technology policy complements the private sector with public investments in areas where the long-term economic, environmental, or social objectives are not adequately or immediately rewarded in the marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Reinvent Environmental Protection<a href="ch6.html"> (Chapter 6)</a>. Americans solidly support a cleaner and healthier environment, and as a Nation, we have enjoyed substantial progress in protecting our environment and decreasing public health risks over the past two decades. However, the current system of environmental protection can be reformed to increase benefits and decrease costs-while still reflecting the fundamental environmental values of our citizens. By combining market forces and technology, the Administration has embarked on many initiatives to increase energy efficiency, prevent pollution, reduce costs, enhance flexibility, and strengthen accountability. Taken as a whole, these initiatives are the first steps in transforming environmental protection into a more sustainable system.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Engage the International Market <a href="ch7.html">(Chapter 7)</a>. While the development of international markets for energy and technology poses risks for our Nation, it also presents tremendous opportunities. Through international technology and development programs, participation in multilateral activities, and strong commitment to U.S. companies that export the energy technologies that enable sustainable development, the Administration is working to expand high-wage jobs in the United States and help other nations develop in ways that will ease the burden of energy development on the global environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<a href="ch2.html">Chapter 2</a> presents a brief overview of our national and global energy picture. This overview highlights the trends that shape our energy use, as well as the challenges and opportunities that define the scope and intent of national energy policy.<BR>
