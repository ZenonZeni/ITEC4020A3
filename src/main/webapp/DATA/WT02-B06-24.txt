<P><CENTER><B>STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT</B></CENTER>

<P>President Clinton and I are committed to promoting the growth of electronic
commerce and robust, secure communications worldwide while protecting the
public safety and national security.  To that end, this Administration is
consulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state and
local law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major initiative
to liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect
their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.  It
will support the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of
the global information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S.
encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key management
infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption products
will be permitted under a general license after one-time review, and contingent
upon industry commitments to build and market future products that support
key recovery.  This policy will apply to hardware and software products.
 The relaxation of controls will last up to two years.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technology
strategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the ultimate
solution must be market-driven.<BR>
<BR>
Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make commitments
to develop and sell products that support the key recovery system that I
announced in July.  That vision presumes that a trusted party (in some cases
internal to the user's organization) would recover the user's confidentiality
key for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under proper authority.
 Access to keys would be provided in accordance with destination country
policies and bilateral understandings.  No key length limits or algorithm
restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products.<BR>
<BR>
Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain
free to use any encryption system domestically.<BR>
<BR>
The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption
policy initiative designed to promote electronic information security and
public safety.  For export control purposes, commercial encryption products
will no longer be treated as munitions.  After consultation with Congress,
jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred from
the State Department to the Commerce Department.  The Administration also
will seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providing
penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery agents
against liability when they properly release a key.<BR>
<BR>
As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the purchase
of key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote key recovery arrangements
in bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop federal cryptographic
and key recovery standards, and stimulate the development of innovative
key recovery products and services.<BR>
<BR>
Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued after
one-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit benchmarks
and milestones for developing and incorporating key recovery features into
their products and services, and for building the supporting infrastructure
internationally.  Initial approval will be contingent on firms providing
a plan for implementing key recovery.  The plan will explain in detail the
steps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute, and/or market
encryption products with key recovery features.  The specific commitments
will depend on the applicant's line of business.<BR>
<BR>
The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periods
if milestones are met.  Two years from now, the export of 56-bit products
that do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted.  Currently
exportable 40-bit mass market software products will continue to be exportable.
 We will continue to support financial institutions in their efforts to
assure the recovery of encrypted financial information.  Longer key lengths
will continue to be approved for products dedicated to the support of financial
applications.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry, users,
state and local law enforcement, and other private sector representatives
with the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery.  Topics will
include:
<UL>
<LI>evaluating the developing global key recovery architecture
<LI>assessing lessons-learned from key recovery implementation
<LI>advising on technical confidence issues vis-a-vis access to and release
of keys
<LI>addressing interoperability and standards issues
<LI>identifying other technical, policy, and program issues for governmental
action.
</UL>
The Administration's initiative is broadly consistent with the recent recommendations
of the National Research Council.  It also addresses many of the objectives
of pending Congressional legislation.<BR>
