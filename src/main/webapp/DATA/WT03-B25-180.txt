The Search for Good News

<P>The general election has by now come and gone, and with it a good deal of the negative mongering in the 
media, the mud-slinging and name-calling. Negative television advertising has again been replaced by, well, advertising. Life goes on.

<P>But something occurred to me during the last several months: Which is that no one really addresses the good stuff that's been going on in this country. What's working, and why. Don't get me wrong: I haven't been living in a tunnel, nor am I so naive as not to know that it's true that for the last 18 months or so, everyone so politically motivated has been taking credit for all that's going well with the nation, while denying culpability for all that's not. That's the nature of politics, and Americans don't have a corner on this.

<P>What I've been thinking about is <I>why</I> the good stuff--why &quot;America Inc.&quot;--is working. What good stuff? Start generally with the state of our economy. Our employment level. Our inflation rate. Our interest rates. Our factory orders for and output of durable goods. Our exports. Our new home starts...In fact, most of the usual economic indicators are on (and have been for some time) the plus side (the stagnancy of real, spendable income 
for workers notwithstanding).

<P>No one along the way has been asking why these things are (don't question what works? Leave well 
enough alone?), especially when many of our traditional global competitors have been for several years now in the doldrums. Which is another way of saying in highly fragile economic straits--growing unemployment, rising inflation, wild currency fluctuations, falling exports, social and civil unrest.

<P>The European Economic Community, for example, can't seem to come together, in any serious communal 
sense anyway (especially with the German Bundesbank's inflexibility in devaluing the deutsche mark, which 
leaves France and other countries grumbling aloud about their interrelated currency woes and, consequently, labor/unemployment difficulties). And Japan's long-rumored come-back is not yet imminent (&quot;Don't rule Japan out,&quot; is the sage advice. 

<P>Well, no one's ruling <I>anyone</I> out, but until Japan again fields a strong, competitive team, it's difficult to see them <I>taking</I> the field.).

<P>What's been going on (and what we oddly shy away from talking about, perhaps because it makes for 
pretty uninteresting &quot;news&quot;) is that this country has considerable advantages over many of its competitors. And I'm not talking about natural resources (but, of course, there is that, and many observers of Japan say that the &quot;resource thing&quot; has now become a major hurdle they're finding it increasingly difficult to surmount).

<P>No, what I'm referring to here is what American business and industry <I>isn't</I> saddled with. Most business owners will tell you they're over-taxed (as will most individuals), but the truth of the matter is that comparatively speaking, the tax burden here is slight compared to many of our European competitors. Further, American business is not saddled with cradle-to-grave employment guarantees (although unions like the UAW strive ardently in their negotiations to secure existing jobs--as well they should). American workers' wages are 
reasonable compared to those of other highly industrialized countries (one only needs to look at the level of foreign investment--from Germany, from Japan, from Korea--to see this. They're not coming here because of the aesthetics of the countryside to set up manufacturing sites. It's a simple matter: wages, a talented labor pool, and U.S. workers don't take the whole month of August off and head for Spain.) Nor is American business strapped with supporting an enormous social services and welfare system (you think we've got welfare here, visit London, or Zurich, or Amsterdam or Stockholm).

<P>The point is that one of the single-most important reasons American Inc. (and our resultant economic 
good health) continues strong and to hum right along is because it is relatively unbridled by those financial, social and institutional obligations and commitments many of our competitors face--and are increasingly becoming frustrated over how to deal with. 

<P>Look, I'm not denying we've got our share of problems--social, educational, moral, and ethical. And these draw a lot of ink, headline-wise. <BR>
What doesn't is that the American &quot;experiment,&quot; from a business and industry perspective, is working. Which is the good news. And why it's not on the news.
