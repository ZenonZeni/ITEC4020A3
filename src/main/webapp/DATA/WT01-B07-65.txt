The work presented in this paper is aimed at the definition of tracer gas experimental procedures for measuring the air change rate, the age of air and the air change efficiency in real buildings under mechanical ventilation conditions. The measurement procedures, based on the decay method, were validated in a special experimental chamber and implemented in two rooms of a building under real operating conditions. Measurements of volumetric flow rate through the air ducts of two buildings, performed by means of the constant emission rate method, will be shown and commented. Results of some measurements obtained by tracer gas technique have been compared with values measured by using other traditional methods.

The first part of the paper will show some aspects of experimental research on air distribution in ventilated rooms. The study has been carried out to get an understanding of the air movement and the ventilation effectiveness by means of tracer gas measurements. It has been investigated the velocity and the distribution of the concentration in a two-dimensional isothermal flow issue of a linear supply opening. The second part of the paper will describe a proposed zonal model in 9 zones. This model is able to predict the steady-state behaviour of ventilated rooms and the dynamic evolution of a possible pollutant concentration in such environment. The theoretical model is based on the flow element method according to the throw of an isothermal jet and on a typical configuration of a zonal model. Comparison between experimental measurements and the zonal model show a good agreement on the range of usual air change rate in the ventilated rooms.

The common way to determine air infiltration, exfiltration and interzonal flows from tracer gas measurements in multizoned buildings is to rely upon the standard single or multizone model, Vc(t) = Qc(t)+p(t). Here c, p are zonal tracer concentrations and injections, t is time and V, Q are the sought volumes and flows. This model may work well provided that all zones are sufficiently well mixed and all flows really are constant during the measurements. The latter can be doubtful in naturally ventilated buildings, especially as the measurements may require several hours. This paper discusses one single question: What could be gained if the flows of the model are allowed to vary in time?, ie we will consider a (bilinear) model:Vc(t) = Q(t)+p(t). The variation of Q(t) will, however, be restricted to be piecewise linear. This extension will complicate the identification procedure, ie the computations, somewhat. On the other hand it does not alter the tracer gas measurements needed. The idea is rather to pick out more information from the standard tracer gas measurements. To test the extended model, single-tracer gas measurements have been carried out in a natural ventilated row house. Some basic concepts are introduced with one and two zone models and the house is modelled with a nine zones model. As intended, the extended model matches the measurements better. However, as demonstrated in the paper, this does not guarantee that the model found actually is better.

This paper reports on the use of BRE's domestic ventilation model, BREVENT, to predict subfloor and whole house ventilation rates in a BRE/DoE test house. Before the model could be used though some minor adjustments were necessary because one of its underlying assumptions was that the subfloor temperature was equal to the external temperature. Temperature measurements over a number of months showed this assumption to be false and so an extra stack term was introduced into the model. However, the overall difference this makes is still quite small, only a few percent at most. The predicted subfloor ventilation rate matched the calculated value well, particularly when it was stack dominated. When wind played a significant part though the level of agreement deteriorated, particularly when subfloor air bricks were located on unsheltered walls. However, both the subfloor and whole house ventilation rate of the test house appears to be heavily influenced by the stack effect because the suspended floor and ceiling are leaky in comparison to the walls. As a result, subfloor ventilation will be stack dominated about 61% of the time. To improve the prediction of wind affected subfloor ventilation better pressure coefficient data is required. In a similar vein BREVENT can predict whole house ventilation rates best when the flow is stack dominated. Analysis of the separate stack and wind effects show that the ventilation in the test house will be stack dominated for about 86% of the time. When wind speed does influence ventilation then wind direction also has an effect: winds blowing from the East and West generally give ventilation rates 25% lower than those blowing from the North and South.

Existing experimental techniques for calculating air flow through building cracks are usually based upon relationships derived from experimental studies employing relatively simple procedures. Typically, a fixed pressure difference, DELTA P, is established across the crack of interest and then the air flow Q through the crack is determined. Most crack flow equations take the pressure differential DELTA P to be steady-state. In reality, the wind forces which generate much of the driving pressures represent highly fluctuating signals. A basic problem is to know what effect a fluctuating DELTA P has on the overall air flow through building cracks. The basic aim of this study was to determine the impact of these fluctuating pressures on crack flow equations. Experimental techniques generated sinusoidal pressure fluctuations across a range of fabricated, straight-through cracks, ranging from 1 to 5 mm thickness. Fluctuation frequencies from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz were used in the investigations. The results suggest that the average flow under conditions of fluctuating pressure differentials does not differ significantly from the flow which would occur if the mean pressure differential were imposed. This implies that the instantaneous flow at any fluctuating value of the pressure differential is that corresponding to the pressure differential on the steady-state flow-pressure curve.

Tracer gases are commonly used to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. One way to reduce the time, complexity, and cost of such experiments is to use the carbon dioxide generated by occupants as a tracer gas. In this paper, a method for using the carbon dioxide generated by occupants as a tracer gas for determining the effective supply air flow rate to a zone or the relative air-change effectiveness of a zone is described. The approach is to make use of a model of the accumulation dynamics and a model of the way that occupants generate carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide accumulation dynamics are modeled as a first-order perfect-mixing process with bypass. The rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide is modeled as an integrated random process. Sudden changes in the rate at which carbon dioxide is generated in a zone that occur when occupants enter and leave are detected using statistical techniques. The detector is used to adjust the gains of an estimator that determines either the effective supply air flow rate or the relative air-change effectiveness and also the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide. This can be done even when the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide changes with time and when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the supply air changes with time. The performance of the strategy is demonstrated with experimental results on a room in a working building.

In order to study the use of electricity in Swedish office buildings in detail, the Swedish Council for Building Research initiated four monitoring and building simulation projects in 1989. The project buildings represent different ages and different HVAC technologies. Based on a combination of hourly monitored data during four years, building simulations using the DOE2 program have been carried out. In two of the buildings, energy conservation measures have been implemented too. An interesting aspect in our study is the so called load factor. Load factors for lighting and other electric loads are evaluated. Taking this into account, you can optimize the design of the air flow rates and the cooling systems and reduce the investment and operational costs for the HVAC systems. Thanks to a correct HVAC design you may also reduce the negative impact on the environment by less use of CFCs etc. The studies indicate that the load factor variation in Swedish office buildings, during a day or a week, diverge substantially from the schedules for lighting and office machines etc according to the ASHRAE 90.1-1989 Standard. Regarding office machines etc, the installed power density also diverges to a great extent.

Ad Hoc Group 4 of Working Group 2 of CEN TC156 (Ventilation) was set up to put forward standardised techniques for estimating ventilation rates in dwellings. The purpose of the standard is to ensure that different people carrying out calculations with the same input data will obtain the same result. This will allow the use of these results in energy, heating load, IAQ or other calculations. The methods proposed use two different techniques, an explicit and an implicit one. The explicit one involves more approximations, but can be carried out with a hand calculator. The implicit one requires the use of a computer. This paper explains the methods used, justifies the approximations made and gives examples of the use of the explicit method. These show that the explicit method gives results in good, but not perfect, agreement with experiment, and also that the method is simple to use.

A Probabilistic model of air change rate in a single family house based on full-scale measurements has been developed. The probability of air change rate exceeding certain prescribed limits (risk of improper ventilation or excessive heat flow) is evaluated by utilising the distribution function based on calculated air flow rate. In this way the results are expressed in terms of the R-S model generally used in the safety analysis of structures. In particular, the probability of excessive and/or insufficient air infiltration can be expressed in terms of safety index BETA to describe the reliability of the building with respect to natural ventilation. The probability density functions for the air change rate have been established for different wind directions. Two methods of reducing the risk of unhygienic conditions have been studied. The first one is based on introducing extra small openings uniformly distributed over the building envelope and providing a fully naturally ventilated system. The second method consists in introducing mechanical exhaust ventilation system coupled with natural ventilation. Probability distributions of air change rates have been analysed for these two cases.

System safety of the performance of mechanical ventilation systems can of course be analysed by means of general methods for system safety analysis. Such methods are used a lot in industrial practice, especially in manufacturing industry. However applications on ventilation systems are more or less non-existing today. This paper summarises today's methods for system safety analysis and shows possible future ways of applying the methods on performance analyses of mechanical ventilation systems.

Although the power law has been broadly accepted in measurement and air infiltration standards, and in many air infiltration calculation methods, the assumption that the power law is true over the range of pressures that a building envelope experiences has not been well documented. In this paper, we examine the validity of the power law through theoretical analysis, laboratory measurements of crack flow and detailed field tests of building envelopes. The results of the theoretical considerations, and field and laboratory measurements indicate that the power law is valid for low pressure building envelope leakage.

Train tunnels and subways are an interesting field of ventilation. Trains move air through tunnels at rates of 600 m3/s which is much more than flow rates in buildings. Air pressures can vary up to some 3000 Pa leading to air velocities in the range of 10 to 50 m/s. This can lead to unsafe situations and thermal discomfort. The development of high speed trains causes more concern for better tunnel design. Modern stations often house small shops and restaurants, that require lower air velocities for thermal comfort. A dynamical ventilation model has been made to study effects of improvements. An array of controlled fans seems to be a very effective draught remover. The dynamical model is programmed to serve as a demo to give insight in the matter and can be shown in just a couple of minutes from a PC. A copy can be requested via e-mail to J.Phaff@bouw.tno.nl Subject: Train Demo. This demo version is just intended for demonstration purposes and must not be used for the design of real tunnels.

A study of the reliability of systems by considering the ability of different systems to maintain a required air flow rate over time is included in a subtask of IEA Annex 27 "Evaluation and Demonstration of Domestic Ventilation Systems". Measurements and calculations were performed to determine the variation in ventilation rates due to variation in climate and variation in performance of the ventilation system. Dwellings with passive stack, mechanical exhaust and mechanical exhaust-supply ventilation, representative of the Swedish housing stock, were studied. Diagnostic tests were carried out, to discover if the installed ventilation system was functioning as designed and to determine certain values eg characteristics of inlets and outlets. The airtightness was tested. The air flows in mechanical ventilation were measured. The continuous monitoring included measurements in dwellings of overall and local (individual rooms) ventilation rates, and measurements of boundary conditions, during three different monthly periods. The ventilation rates were monitored using tracer gas; passive techniques for monthly averaging and constant concentration for hourly averaging. The measured ventilation rates were simulated using COMIS, a multi-zone air flow network model. The simulated and measured average total outdoor ventilation rates agree reasonably well, while there can be disagreement for hourly rates and individual rooms. This paper presents and discusses the measurements and the calculations and compares the two.

Natural ventilation is being applied to an increasing number of new buildings to minimise reliance on mechanical ventilation and so reduce emission of greenhouse gases. However, passive stack ventilation (PSV) systems are currently designed without incorporating heat recovery leading to significant wastage of energy. Heat recovery systems have not been used in naturally-ventilated buildings because the pressure loss caused by a conventional heat exchanger is large compared to the stack pressure and could cause the ventilation system to fail. In addition, the stack pressure decreases owing to reduction of the temperature difference associated with the heat exchange, although this problem can be lessened by appropriate siting of the heat exchanger to maximise the effective stack height. In this study, natural convective flow through PSV stacks were computed using CFD to determine the effect of the layout of heat-pipe assemblies as well as the effects of spacing and length of fins on reduction of flow rate through the stack. Among the layout patterns examined, the arrangement where the assemblies are placed in a pattern of an arrow facing the flow direction produced the least insertion flow loss. The flow loss due to the insertion of the heat pipe assemblies (IFL) was found to increase sharply with the number of fins and reached over 30% when only 4 fins were used. IFL also increased with fin length but the rate of increase reduced for larger fin lengths. Therefore, for a given total surface area of fins, using fins with a larger length causes less flow loss than fins with a smaller spacing.

The work described in this paper is aimed at predicting the local values of the ventilation effectiveness parameters of large industrial buildings by a technique which involves the use of computational fluid dynamics and multizonal modelling. A modelling technique is described and applied to a typical modern industrial building equipped with both, mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The results of modelling each of the above systems are presented and discussed. They provide an interesting insight into magnitude and spatial variations in local air change index that occur in the occupied space. The results also demonstrate how differences in ventilation strategy can result in distinctly different variations of ventilation effectiveness parameters. It is concluded that the modelling technique described may be used to provide important information about the air movement characteristics of buildings in terms of local air change index and also that it could prove to be a very useful design aid.

This paper describes the ventilation analysis undertaken during the design of a new music centre for which it was desired to avoid the use of air conditioning and conventional ducted mechanical ventilation. The main objective was to predict the thermal comfort of occupants in the centre's main auditorium during summertime performances. The analysis was done using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a dynamic thermal model. The CFD results were used to decide the size and location of openings for natural ventilation, which led to the final design having a much better distribution of incoming fresh air than the initial design. The peak fresh air ventilation rate was reduced, but this did not significantly increase the risk of summertime overheating. The dynamic thermal analysis predicted that the time when the temperature would be over 25 degrees C ranged from 0.3 performance hours/year with a dense concrete roof construction and an orchestra of 30 to 3.5 performance hours/year with a lightweight roof and an orchestra of 100. Given that the larger orchestra would not be formal and so could wear lighter clothing, it was concluded that natural ventilation should be a viable strategy for controlling the risk of summertime overheating. However, given uncertainties regarding the usage of the space and UK summertime temperatures in the future, it was recommended that provision was made in the design to enable mechanical cooling to be added at a later date.

This paper describes an experimental investigation into the operation of a modified Trombe wall. The construction has been altered to include a layer of insulation material; two alternative positions for this insulation layer have been considered and tested. Air flow from the top of the Trombe wall has also been enhanced by the inclusion of a low power axial flow fan which was controlled to function dependent on measured temperature in the wall cavity. The construction with exposed concrete facing into the air cavity has a slower response than that with exposed insulation facing the cavity. The concrete option also produces higher outlet temperatures, though the fan was found to operate for longer periods with the insulation option. The controller used could be developed for employment in more sophisticated control strategies.

This paper reports on work carried out at BRE to address the need for guidance on designing for natural ventilation via single-sided and cross-ventilation in office spaces and the limits of application on terms of plan depth. Present guidance suggests that natural ventilation will be adequate up to 6 m from the ventilating facade. This leads to the conventional design of offices up to 6 m deep on either side of a central corridor, giving as a rule of thumb a width of 15 m for a building with natural cross-ventilation. The present work looks at the opportunities for going beyond these rules of thumb. The implications for thermal comfort and draught risk are also assessed. In the conclusions issues such as, local ventilation rates, ventilating air penetration from a facade, the use of artificial mixing (eg ceiling fans) on hot days, the position of windows, and means of enhancing internal air speeds and air change rates are discussed.

Electric utilities in the Pacific Northwest have spent over $100 million to support energy efficiency improvements in the HUD-code manufactured housing industry in the Pacific Northwest over the past several years. Over 65,000 manufactured housing units have been built since 1991 that exceed the new HUD standards for both thermal performance and mechanical ventilation that became effective in October, 1994. All of these units included mechanical ventilation systems that were designed to meet or exceed the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62-1989. This paper addresses the ventilation solutions that were developed and compares the comfort and energy considerations of the various strategies that have evolved in the Pacific Northwest and nationally. The use and location of a variety of outside air inlets will be addressed, as will the acceptance by the occupants of the ventilation strategy.

Since 1985 more than 170 very low energy houses, all of the same type and structure, were built in the Flemish Region, Belgium. Because conduction losses are very low, ventilation losses become very important, up to 45% of the heat losses if no heat recovery is utilised. Three of the houses were monitored in detail for energy consumption, energy and ventilation efficiency. All houses are equipped with the same ventilation system: balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Tracer gas measurements, pressurisation tests, multipoint temperature measurements and on site and laboratory tests of the heat recovery system, give us a complete scope of the ventilation system and its energy and ventilation efficiency. Pressurisation and depressurisation tests revealed the main air leaks in the construction: the different connections wall-floor and wall-roof, the window perimeter, even the sockets. Extra care in construction practice changed the n50-value from an average of 4.5 AC/h to 3.5AC/h, still high for a house with controlled ventilation. After testing the airtightness, we carried out tracer gas measurements in whole dwellings and between the different zones. Real ventilation rates and interzonal flows were derived. Questions like: Are the airflows in accordance with the design values? Do they match the requirements? How can we measure interzonal flows with one tracer? were answered. The paper gives a mathematical description of the tracer gas flow patterns (solution of the differential flow equations) and compares the results with the measured data. To complete the evaluation we carried out laboratory tests and field measurements on the heat recovery system. In laboratory the flat plate cross-flow heat exchanger showed a thermal efficiency up to 65% under specific climate conditions. In the dwellings, insulation and airtightness of the ducts appeared to be very important. The temperature efficiency decreased to values less than 45%. As a conclusion, one may stress that a global evaluation of the ventilation efficiency has to include different tests. The medium or poor airtightness has the greatest impact on the energy efficiency of heat recovery and on the ability to control the system. Detailed testing also showed some flaws in the ventilation system and in the building construction.

Ventilation by displacement is a type of ventilation where the air flow is thermally driven. By this arrangement one obtains two zones in the room - a lower zone with supply air conditions and an upper recirculation zone with extract air conditions. Cold climate causes downdraught from windows and external walls and results in a mixing of air from the upper into the lower zone. To avoid this problem during cold climate a new principle for ventilation by displacement is tested. Excess heat from the upper zone of the room is used for heating cold surfaces. The principle involves creation of a narrow space in front of the exterior wall, separating the cold wall from direct contact with room air. Extract air from the ceiling level is forced down through this space by an extraction fan. This method can advantageously by applied in large buildings where an external wall mainly consists of glass panes. In this case it might be appropriate to utilise the space between the inner couple of glasses for extract air. Tracer gas and temperature measurements were carried out in a test-room. The result shows that the ventilation efficiency improves when using the new principle. The thermal climate also improves due to less down-draught and higher surface temperatures.

Many dwellings with natural or gravity ventilation systems suffer from poor airchange rates. In Sweden, especially houses built in the 1960-ies and 1970-ies heated with electric resistance heating and thus without chimneys, are at risk. Improving the airchange rate in these houses is to some extent performed to decrease Radon gas concentrations where appropriate. For comfort, most homeowners learn to live with low airchange rates, accepting eg odours or window condensation and trying to compensate this with increased airing. They are often reluctant to install mechanical ventilation systems. This paper describes a new concept for an occupancy-controlled exhaust air ventilation system. The system features bedroom night-time ventilation, wet-room day-time ventilation and variable total air flow at a low installation cost. The system has since autumn 1994 been successfully installed in four houses and evaluated by air flow measurements, tracer gas tests, multizone airchange calculations etc. The homeowners are very pleased with the performance of the systems and the improved airchange rates.

Especially in modern buildings with small capacity of humidity storage it is necessary to reduce the humidity in the supply air. Normally this was done by using a refrigeration system mostly with CFC's. There are some alternative fluids available, but mostly they show a high global warming potential. All these systems need electrical energy to be driven and therefore it is necessary to consider other possibilities with alternative systems. The most promising systems are sorptive systems that are used now in open cycles. In these systems the air is dehumidified by a liquid sorbent and cooled indirectly by evaporating water in an open circuit. In order to calculate the process of absorption on several conditions, computer based calculations are required. A model that describes the dehumidification process is introduced.

Traditional air-handling unit (AHU) control systems link the position of the exhaust air damper, recirculation air damper, and outdoor air damper. Tests at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on a variable-air-volume (VAV) AHU have shown that air can enter the AHU through the exhaust air damper. This can negatively impact indoor air quality if the exhaust air duct is located near a pollution source. This paper presents a new control system for variable air volume AHU's that use volume matching to control the return fan. The new control system links only the position of the exhaust air damper and recirculation air damper. During occupied times, the outdoor air damper is in the fully open position. Simulation and laboratory results are presented to compare the new control system and a traditional control system. Several cases are simulated to examine the effect of damper sizing and system load on airflow in AHU's. The simulations demonstrate that the new control system can prevent air from entering the AHU through the exhaust air damper for conditions that the traditional control system cannot. A case demonstrating the limits of the new control system to prevent this phenomenon is included in the simulation results. The laboratory results provide further evidence that the new control system prevents air from entering the AHU through the exhaust air damper for conditions that cause the phenomenon with the traditional control system.

Wind pressures can significantly affect ventilation performance. However often they are overlooked in the design of a naturally ventilated building, with buoyancy forces presumed to offer the worst case scenario for design. The result is that airflow patterns and the ventilation performance of the building is often different from the design intent. Successful natural ventilation design requires careful consideration of the building form, and so must involve the architect at the early stages of fabric development. Whilst devices and features may be used to enhance the performance of ventilation outlets, the wind flows at inlets are more likely to be affected by the form of the building, and less amenable to improvement by small devices. Performance may be improved by larger features that in effect become part of the building form itself. Therefore the designer requires a greater awareness of the effect of wind on natural ventilation. They may require access to targeted design information and design tools that are as yet generally unavailable.

Water use is distributed throughout building structures. Energy used to pump the water to higher levels in the building is not currently recovered, and is dissipated by performing work on air in the ventilation system which is vented to the atmosphere, when the water is discharged into the drainage stack. This energy can be utilised productively, however, by strategically placing the air inlet for the drainage stack inside the building, thereby utilising the potential energy stored in the water to draw air through the building. Airflow induction by falling water films is a well known problem in the drainage industry, and airflow rates of 10-20 times the water flow rate are common. Basic analysis of the ventilation requirements for typical large buildings suggest that this may contribute between 1 and 7.5% of the total ventilation requirement. Air admittance valves would be effective at isolating the habitable space from the waste water.

The suitability of night ventilation for cooling for the UK is first assessed by presenting plots of summer weather data on the bioclimatic chart for three locations within the country. These indicate that most of the external weather conditions lie within the thermal mass and ventilation effectiveness areas of the charts. To confirm this, thermal simulations of a typical office module under a variety of internal conditions and summer weather data were performed. Predictions have shown that internal temperatures can be maintained below the external values for solar and internal gains of up to about 50W/m2. Field measurements in a refurbished natural ventilated office have confirmed that temperatures in night ventilated spaces are generally lower during the following day, especially during the early hours of the working day. Finally, the development of a pre-design tool in the context of IEA Annex 28 on 'Low Energy Cooling Systems' is discussed. The main aim of the tool is to increase the awareness of designers for the energy benefits and the range of parameters for the application of night ventilation as the first means of cooling so that the need for artificial cooling is minimised or avoided altogether.

Natural ventilation studies were carried out within the frame of PASCOOL EC Research Project. Research on this topic included experimental and modelling work aiming to fill the existing gaps in our knowledge of indoor air conditions in naturally ventilated buildings. Experiments were carried out in full scale and test cell facilities during the summer period. Single sided and cross ventilation as well as air flow through large internal openings were the basic topics that were studied. Existing models were validated and new ones were developed. A new computational tool for ventilation prediction was developed, based on the airflow network modeling. An intermediate approach, between network and CFD was proposed to take into account the impact of non-homogeneity on the indoor air motion.

Wind towers (scoops situated on the roofs of buildings to catch the wind) have been in use for centuries in the Middle east and Pakistan, to provide ventilation and cooling with minimal mechanical plant. In Europe, the problem of cooling buildings has generally not been significant, but in recent years there has been a trend towards substantial increases in internal heat gains from IT equipment etc and overheating in summer has become one of our major concerns. This has been dealt with by the use of air conditioning, but in many instances this could be avoided by making better use of natural ventilation through wind towers. This paper reviews the use of wind towers for cooling spaces, and reports on work currently being carried out, using wind tunnel tests on scale models, to examine the adaptation of these principles for use in modern office buildings, in order to avoid expensive air conditioning.
