It's time for a change in America. Eight out of 10 Americans polled believe
that the country is headed in the wrong direction. <BR>
<BR>
The questions are -- how did this happen, and what's to be done about it?
<BR>
<BR>
Answers: We have tolerated too much, and it's time to stop! <BR>
<BR>
The innumerable problems facing our nation were not born overnight. We originally
tolerated them in their harmless infancy. Now that they have grown dangerous,
society decries them. We want someone to blame. Yet, we are that society.
We are responsible for what is. <BR>
<BR>
Let's look at how it all happens. <BR>
<BR>
It is human nature to adjust, accommodate and readily tolerate slow and
incremental changes in life. This capacity to adapt has great survival value,
but it is also humanity's Achilles' heel. For we can learn to tolerate almost
anything, even to the point of our own undoing. <BR>
<BR>
The founders of America recognized this tendency when they wrote in the
Declaration of Independence that &quot;. . . all experience has shown that
mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to
right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
What an insightful but also alarming sentence. There is this human tendency
to tolerate the evils around us and a hesitancy to take action against them.
Yes, we have a wonderful ability to adapt to and tolerate most anything.
It is in our nature. But, this capacity must be governed by forethought,
self-discipline and the courage to challenge, or it will slowly and incrementally
result in self- destruction. <BR>
<BR>
Take crime, for example. Look at how well society has passively adjusted
to living with it: deadbolt locks, Mace, attack dogs, whistles, handguns
-- 60 million legal ones -- and lots of protective barriers. Security guard
have become one of the leading employment opportunities in the United States.
We have become accustomed to hourly crime as the reality of American life.
<BR>
<BR>
Through this slow and incremental process, society can become tolerant of
and habituated to the very behaviors that can destroy it. Here is a sample
of behaviors to which we have grown accustomed: In addition to crime in
the street, we tolerate poor manners, disrespectful youth, poor performance
in the classroom and workplace, litter on the side of our roads and underage
drinking. <BR>
<BR>
How does tolerating such apparently minor misbehaviors affect the national
character? Easily. Once a critical mass of citizens engage in them, societal
meltdown is soon to follow. <BR>
