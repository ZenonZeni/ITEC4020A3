Since 1975, special education law has required the states to have a comprehensive system of
personnel development (CSPD).   Each state must develop a system to ensure that personnel
involved in special education are adequately prepared and receive continuing education.  This
helps teachers by ensuring that they are trained to do their work and guards against serious
personnel shortages. <P>

The goals of the National Institute of Comprehensive System of Personnel Development
(CSPD) are to provide the training and support to leaders of State Education Agencies
(SEAs), Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), and Local Education Agencies (LEAs) and
other significant stakeholders who are collaborating to establish and organize the state's
special education CSPD as an effective vehicle for change.<P>

Since 1990 the National Institute for CSPD Collaboration has had the opportunity to work with
over 40 states and territories in developing a CSPD strategic plan. Through our involvement
with these teams, we have consistently noticed that the core of a successful state CSPD is a
dynamic state-level stakeholder leadership CSPD committee   one that effectively
determines the needs of personnel and meets those needs through strategic planning.<P>

Since PL 94-142 was enacted, the components of a CSPD have been viewed as separate
pieces (i.e., preservice, evaluation, needs assessment, collaboration, dissemination, technical
assistance, and continuing education).  Even though these elements are the foundation for
developing a CSPD, states frequently do not integrate the parts into a working whole that
creates a comprehensive system. With the addition of CSPD regulations for Part H and
vocational rehabilitation, states now have the opportunity to create a CSPD that successfully
addresses training issues from birth through adulthood.<P>

To accurately assess personnel development needs throughout the state, some states are
moving toward regionalizing their CSPD. Regional CSPD teams, based on the regional
configuration of any given state, are modeled after the state committee. Each region may have
representation on the state CSPD committee. Each region will develop a strategic plan based
on the needs of the region. Each region will submit its strategic plan to the state committee
which will become the basis for assessing the state professional development needs. In some
cases the state will have a level of funding to assist the region in implementing its plan. The
regional needs, plus the state agencies' needs, will form the basis for the state CSPD plan,
which will become part of the state plan.<P>

A statewide CSPD strategic plan is a vehicle that will allow local and statewide professional
development efforts to become a continuous process of change. A coordinated, focused
CSPD committee that embraces leadership and change through statewide professional
development activities is the backbone of systemic change.<P>
