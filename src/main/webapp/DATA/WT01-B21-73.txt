<h1>CANNABIS AND MARINOL IN THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE HEADACHE </h1>

<p><b>by</b> </p>

<p><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Edie L., a thirty eight year old pert, intense, intelligent,
articulate stock broker and former law student suffers from
severe one-sided headaches that started when she was eleven years
old. Aggravated by bacon, wines, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce,
and complicated by severe menstrual cramping, she had been
virtually house bound for weeks at a time. If the immobilizing
pain, nausea, and depression from the attacks weren't bad enough,
the side effects from conventional pharmacotherapy wrought
further dysfunction. </p>

<p>Sedatives like phenobarbital and minor tranquilizers like
Valium and Ativan left her sleepy and oversedated. Trips to the
emergency room were frequent where Demerol (meperidine) and
ergotamine (up to 3 injections in 24 hours) would bring the
attack under control. </p>

<p>She had been to numerous specialists and underwent extensive
workups including spinal taps, brain wave studies, xrays, allergy
tests, and psychiatric interviews. </p>

<p>She made the observation that if she smoked marijuana just as
the symptoms of an attack were starting that the attack could be
kept at bay or stopped. She told this to several specialists who
were treating her but this was either ignored or dismissed. </p>

<p>Because I could not prescribe marijuana Marinol was
prescribed. Starting dropwise from puncturing a 10 milligram
capsule using a method described by Dr. J. Russell Reynolds in
1890:&quot;The dose should be given in minimum quantity, repeated
in not less than four or six hours, and gradually increased by
one drop every third or fourth day, until either relief is
obtained, or the drug is proved, in such case, to be
useless.&quot; </p>

<p>Actually, the adjustment of the dose came more easily. She
found that her response to Marinol was not exquisitely sensitive
and within several days she found that 10 milligrams two or three
times a day was sufficient. The migraine attacks ceased.
Subjectively, the Marinol did not cause sedation or immobility as
with the other drugs but produced a feeling of well-being and
relieved feelings of depression. The other medications worsened
feelings of depression and immobility. </p>

<p>The expense of Marinol was, unfortunately prohibitive, causing
her to have to resort to illicit cannabis of varying potency.
Because of her continuing intermittantly severe recurrent
depression and premigraine anxiety, she has been unable to return
to work. On follow-up four years later she has had &quot;..only
one meperidine trip to the emergency room in the past two
years.&quot; She makes oral preparations using inexpensive
Mexican marijuana. She complains of not being able to optimize
the potency of her confections because of the varying potencies
and small quantities she must prepare. She also must resort to
smoking marijuana which is her route of least preference.
Notwithstanding, the use of cannabis for the treatment of
migraine headache and depression has proven to be better than any
of the previous conventional drug treatments she has been
prescribed. </p>

<p>Edie's case is not without precedent. A physician of a century
ago would have prescribed cannabis in one of the many purified
preparations that were available. Today, most physicians,
including headache specialists, are unaware of this and or that
Marinol is one of the active principles of cannabis. </p>

<p>Migraine Headache is a specific type of pain for which
cannabis was first described to be useful by J. Russell Reynolds
. After some thirty years clinical experience after this initial
observation, he described &quot;Migraine: very many victims have
for years kept their sufferings in abeyance by taking hemp at the
moment of threatening, or onset of the attack.&quot; In Osler's
medical text it was the treatment of choice for migraine
headache. The most recent (and last) mention of cannabis for the
treatment of migraine was from Morris Fishbein, M.D., Editor of
the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1942. </p>
