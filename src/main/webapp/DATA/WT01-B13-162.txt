<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast_head.gif" ALT = "A Weather Forcast for International Markets">
<BR>
At a time when many investors are looking overseas for their investment returns, some markets offer more promising weather than others. Dennis Ferro, director of international equities for Zurich Investment Management Limited, provides the following forecast for three markets likely to enjoy favorable conditions and three markets that you might want to avoid. (And, at all times, you'll want to follow this advisory: investment in international securities presents special risk considerations including exchange rates, government regulations and differences in liquidity. Be sure to talk to your financial representative for what's appropriate for your circumstances.)<P>


<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast1_subhead.gif" ALT = "Ireland">
<BR>
One of the smallest foreign markets, Ireland in 1996 has several appeals. Moderate inflation should provide a conducive environment for its good quality, reasonably financed companies to become increasingly competitive on a global scale. Specifically, investors are attracted to its financial services, food processing and specialized manufacturing industries. Ireland's labor force is one of its significant competitive advantages: Workers are well educated and have a good work ethic. While there has been a correlation between the performance of the Irish market and the United Kingdom, Ireland's flexible work force and financial incentives have made it an attractive alternative. <P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast2_subhead.gif" ALT = "The Netherlands">
<BR> 
The Netherlands is an example of a foreign market whose positive fiscal policy has supported corporate progress. Both inflation and unemployment have been relatively low, and several solid companies have succeeded in building strong international businesses. Dutch companies are especially dominant in commercial publishing, electronics and growing software development and computer applications for European corporate needs. <P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast3_subhead.gif" ALT = "Japan">
<BR>
Having suffered a recession for the last five years, Japan should be the comeback story of 1996. The government is addressing its myriad problems (including banking, deregulation and trade), and many corporations have initiated steps to heighten their competitiveness. Increased corporate confidence in the system should result in a resumption of industrial production and capital expenditures - the very events needed for the economy's recovery. The health of Japan, the largest foreign market with a broad base of industries and strong infrastructure, has a direct effect on southeast Asia. Its improvement, then, could help the economies of Malaysia and Singapore.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast4_subhead.gif" ALT = "Germany">
<BR>
Concerns about inflation have kept German monetary policy tight for years. Consequently, interest rates have not fallen at the same pace that economic activity has. <P>

Opportunities in Germany's stock market tend to be large cyclical companies and financial institutions. German companies' ability to compete and expand profit margins is inhibited by relatively high compensation levels. This, combined with a strong deutsche mark, make it difficult for Germany's export industries to compete against products produced by countries with lower average wages.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast5_subhead.gif" ALT = "Russia">
<BR>
Just a few years ago, Russia represented untold potential. Many practicalities - including the government's taxation and regulation - have frustrated foreign investors, and growth has yet to occur as was predicted. IBM's recent cancellation of a manufacturing facility is just one sign that Russia is a market best avoided by the faint of heart.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast6_subhead.gif" ALT = "Brazil">
<BR>
Dramatic rallies draw investors to Latin American markets - but their volatility can also discourage investment. Brazil is an example of a market that has been strong recently, buoyed by an expanding economy heavily dependent on foreign financial support from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. While the country has a developing manufacturing base and a strong resource sector, it is sensitive to export demand and global commodity prices. The health of Brazil's banking system remains suspect, and difficult political decisions must be made if continued progress is to occur. <P>
