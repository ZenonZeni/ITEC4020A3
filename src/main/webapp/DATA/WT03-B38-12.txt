GERMANY:  DOUBLE BOOK-KEEPING FOR DAIMLER AS REGULATORS REFUSE US GAAP

GERMANY'S BIGGEST industrial company, Daimler-Benz, has failed to
persuade domestic accounting regulators that they should accept its US
GAAP accounts. The result is that Daimler will have to continue
publishing earnings calculated in accordance with Germany's commercial
code alongside its US GAAP results.

The Justice Ministry's decision has serious implications for Deutsche
Telekom, which will face the same double book-keeping difficulties as
Daimler next year when its shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Jurgen Funck, state secretary at the Justice Ministry, indicated early
in 1995 that a concession could be granted from the requirement to
publish group accounts that comply with German reporting standards
provided enough companies wanted to avail of it.

In recent weeks, however, the ministry indicated several times that
opponents of the reform had gained the upper hand. Now Herbert Biener,
head of accounting standards at the ministry, has made clear that the
proposed reform has been defeated."We're not going to make this change
just for the sake of two or three companies," he said.

First proposed in March 1995, the proposed concession would have
extricated Daimler-Benz from the double-accounting dilemma it has faced
since its shares were first listed in New York in 1993. Since then,
Daimler has been obliged to produce group accounts under both US GAAP
and the German commercial code and has come up with earnings figures
which are sometimes poles apart.

Led by Bayer and Schering, the opponents of reform were clearly
unwilling to assist Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Telekom in their quest
for foreign capital by agreeing that their US GAAP consolidated
accounts could be also acceptable for domestic regulatory purposes.
They believe that, rather than US GAAP, international accounting
standards (IASs) should become the benchmark for German companies
seeking to raise capital abroad.

While Biener believes that corporations and their accountants should
voluntarily adopt whatever reporting requirements are demanded by
overseas capital markets, he makes no bones about his preference for
IASs. Speaking at a recent accounting conference in Gottingen, Biener
repeatedly criticised Daimler's technique of double-accounting and the
fact that it can produce contradictory results.

IASC secretary-general Bryan Carsberg, who also spoke at the
conference, welcomed the Germans' support for IASs. But he acknowledged
the serious dilemma facing companies which will need a listing on the
New York Stock Exchange before IASs are endorsed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission - which will not happen until 1999 at the earliest.

Carsberg said that companies in that position would have no choice but
to produce US GAAP accounts, but he hoped that they would use options
most comparable with IAS so that it would be easy to change again to
IASs after 1999. Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the European
Commission, said it is doubtful that companies would want to return to
IASs after adopting US GAAP standards, simply because of the upheaval
involved.

It remains to be seen how Daimler will respond, now that the company
faces the prospect of having to produce a US GAAP reconciliation for at
least the next four years.

UNITED KINGDOM:  ASB ANNOUNCES REVISION OF CASH FLOW STANDARD

THE UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has announced proposals to
revise FRS 1, the standard it issued in September 1991 on cash flow
statements. The proposals are contained in exposure draft FRED 10 which
the standard-setter issued on December 7.

Although FRS 1 brought the UK into line with international practice by
scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of a
cash flow statement, ASB chairman David Tweedie acknowledged that the
time has come for more improvement.

"The cash flow statement introduced by FRS 1 itself broke new ground
and has proved both popular and valuable," Tweedie said. "We have now
gained sufficient experience in its practical use to be able to propose
significant improvements."

FRED 10's main features include a proposal to switch to a "pure" cash
flow statement, with the concept of cash equivalents being dropped. The
exposure draft also proposes that expanded disclosures be provided in a
new section dealing with the management of liquid resources. FRED 10
would change the order and headings for cash flow to bring them into
line with those used by directors in their commentaries on operations
and finances. It would also tie the cash flow statement more closely
into the balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flows on the
widely-used financial indicator, net debt.

"Our aim has been to make the cash flow statement simpler to understand
and more descriptive of the way business is conducted," Tweedie said.
"The board believes that the changes represent a significant step
forward, and will be of real benefit to preparers and users of
accounts. Not least of the improvements is the move to pure cash flow
statements."

Comments of the new exposure draft should be sent to the ASB before
March 8.

SMALL COMPANIES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

Separately, a "draft" exposure draft was published in December on
proposals that would abolish the requirement to comply with the ASB's
standards for 90 percent of UK companies.

The proposed standard, Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller
Enterprises, was published by the Working Party on Big GAAP/Little GAAP
and would affect 900,000 companies.

A key feature of the proposed standard is that small companies should
have a special reporting code of their own which would be much shorter
and less complex than the existing body of accounting standards.

It would apply to all companies currently defined as small by company
law - broadly those with a turnover of less than #2.8 million ($4.3
million). The working party expects to be able to link the proposed
standard with auditing rules, allowing the audit report to use the
words"true and fair . . . as applicable to small companies".

If the proposals find support, the aim is to pass the paper to the ASB
which has the power to turn the draft into a standard after the usual
process of seeking comments on an exposure draft. Comments should be
returned to the working party by March 29.

UNITED STATES:  70% OF BANK SECURITIES MAY NOW BE RECLASSIFIED

A RECENT decision by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
was expected to produce a major shift in bank securities portfolios by
the end of 1995. As many as 70 percent of securities could be
reclassified as "available for sale" as bankers seek to maintain
funding flexibility under the new rule, which is an effort to give
investors a more accurate picture of a bank's worth.

In November, FASB decided to allow banks to move securities from "held
to maturity" to"available for sale" before the end of the year. The one-
time adjustments can be accomplished without forcing the institution to
revalue all of the securities in its held-to-maturity category.

The action already is having an effect. For instance, the First State
Bank of Texas in Denton will use the new rule to make a larger share of
its securities available for sale, probably at a 70-30 split compared
with the previous even split between the two accounts. The 70-30 split
is expected to become common among banks large and small by the end of
the year.

FASB is moving toward making banks mark more of their assets to market
values. FASB has also formally issued a draft of a proposed rule
eliminating some of the advantages of securitisations and long-term
repurchase agreements. Under the proposal, a securitised borrowing that
extends over 90 days will be treated as a purchase and sale (see
report, p8).

It is all part of a continual, incremental effort to put more of the
balance sheet under mark-to-market rules. Some analysts expect the
board to consider marking liabilities to market sometime next year.

ACCOUNTANTS GIVEN ULTIMATUM ON SELF-REGULATION

THE GERMAN Government has served notice on the country's auditors that
they must improve self-regulation to avoid having practice rules
imposed on the profession by law.

Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingen
in early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting policy at
the Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputy
chairman of the professional body of German accountants, the Institut
der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).

Biener took issue with the profession's new quality standards,
introduced just a few days earlier (CAI 64). Even under the new rules,
he said, German accountants would still not be obliged to actively seek
out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts.

"The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said.
"Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The law
allows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obliged
to argue things out with the company."

Biener also criticised the IdW for its delay in dealing with
shortcomings in the 1994 switch by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger
Zements to international accounting standards. Gross countered that it
was not feasible for the IdW's main practice committee to intervene at
an earlier stage, but that the improvements it suggested would be
incorporated into the companies' 1995 accounts.

Biener acknowledged that Germany's leading accounting firms are world-
class, but expressed concern about the profession's rank- and-file
members. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise to
audits which are just average, rather they should allow accountants
with an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which is
up to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died out
because they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession has
grasped that message."

German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regain
public confidence. "Our audits have become suspect," Biener said.
"Sooner or later, German accounts will no longer be accepted by the
international community."

In turn, Biener himself is under pressure from the European Commission
to introduce an accounting regulatory regime along the lines of those
that exist in other EU member states. Addressing the Gottingen
conference, Karel van Hulle, the commission's head of accounting
policy, pointed out that most EU countries have already established
national standard-setting bodies that can further Europe's accounting
interests in the deliberations of the International Accounting
Standards Committee (IASC).

Biener argued that bodies whose agendas are dominated by accounting
interests are not in the best position for regulating the profession.
He said that since all accounting firms have their own commercial
interests, they may avoid making initiatives to change the status quo.
Biener, therefore, suggested that German, and in turn European
companies, set up a regulatory body modelled on the US Financial
Standards Accounting Board.

In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea."I
won't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] body
operates in a sensible fashion," he said. Gross of the IdW countered
that the main practice committee is already operating as a standard-
setter.

DAIMLER-BENZ'S US GAAP PIONEER FOUND DEAD

GERHARD LIENER, the man who revolutionised the German accounting world
by presiding over the publication of the first US GAAP accounts for a
German company, was found dead at his home near Munich in mid-December.
The former finance director of Daimler- Benz, who was 63, is believed
by police to have committed suicide.

Liener was regarded as a traitor by some elements of Germany's
financial establishment because he was instrumental in Daimler's
decision to switch to US GAAP accounts as a condition of listing its
shares in New York. This resulted in a confusing system of double
accounting, with the company's US GAAP results often differing
significantly from those calculated under German accounting
regulations.

Daimler's move is still resented by some of its corporate peers which
had hoped that by presenting a united front in negotiations with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) they could have won exemption
from the more rigorous requirements of US GAAP. Yet at the time of its
1993 Wall Street debut, Daimler had little choice; it needed access to
capital, and a New York listing - necessitating US GAAP accounts - was
the best way to raise it.

Liener was forced to resign from Daimler's management board in May 1995
and responded by blaming the former chief executive, Edzard Reuter, for
a policy of foolhardy expansion. Daimler-Benz is now in serious
financial difficulties and announced a loss of more than DM1 billion
($692 million) in the first half of 1995.

UNITED KINGDOM:  BINDER'S EX-PARTNERS ORDERED TO PAY RECORD SUM

FORMER PARTNERS in London-based accounting firm BDO Binder Hamlyn have
been stunned by a High Court ruling which holds them liable for
damages, interest and costs of #105 million ($166 million) arising from
the 1990 takeover of one of the firm's audit clients.

The damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest ever awarded
against a UK accounting firm and have added new urgency to auditors'
search for liability protection.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989, which were
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found Binder had been negligent in its audit of
Britannia and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it will
succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparo
principles apply," a spokesman said.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm merged with Arthur Andersen. Other Binder offices merged with Stoy
Hayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some of the
partners joined other accounting firms or went into industry. Binder
Hamlyn is still trying to determine exactly how many partners are
liable in the Britannia case.

BANK AUSTRIA SEEKS RECOMPENSE FROM PW LONDON

THE LONDON office of Price Waterhouse is being sued for damages of #146
million ($220 million) by Bank Austria over its role in advising on a
UK acquisition that turned sour.

The suit relates to the purchase by Austria's biggest bank of a 51
percent stake in Sovereign Leasing in 1990. The Manchester- based
company, which was owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin
Harrison, was mainly involved in leasing cars, property and computer
equipment.

Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its
1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45
million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.

Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a due
diligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate finance
advice in connection with the transaction.

In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:
"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations and
advice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceed
with the acquisition.

"It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition
Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the way
it was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position been
revealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not have
proceeded with the acquisition."

In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions of
Sch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing, and in 1992 it forced
the resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of
its UK operations.

Bank Austria also alleges error in a report by PW which stated that
Sovereign made a profit of #3.4 million in 1991, when according to the
bank it actually made a #1.4 million loss.

However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted a
real due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said the
firm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisition
took place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuation
at the time of the purchase.

"We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defend
them," Hainsworth said."If it is being alleged that we valued the
company at between #30 million and #40 million for the purposes of the
transaction in June 1990, then emphatically we deny it."

The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The case
could take two years to be heard.

UNITED KINGDOM:  AUDITORS TO SEEK OFFSHORE LIMITED LIABILITY

UK ACCOUNTING firms are set to follow the lead of their US counterparts
by setting themselves up as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). The
move is designed to protect their partners' personal assets in the
event of being successfully sued for negligence.

Unlike the US Big Six, which took advantage of legislation introduced
in the state of Delaware to become LLPs, UK accounting firms would have
to register their businesses offshore because UK law restricts limited
liability protection for partnerships.

Attention is focused on the Channel Island of Jersey whose Parliament
is considering whether to recognise LLP status. While a dependency of
the British Crown, Jersey does not form part of the UK and has a
measure of administrative independence, including its own legal and tax
system.

In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's Parliamentary Finance
and Economics Committee said it would propose a bill to the island's
Parliament permitting the creation of LLPs. Price Waterhouse and Ernst
& Young have announced that they would register their UK practices
offshore in Jersey if the island chooses to recognise LLP status.

Under the proposed law, an LLP would remain liable for its debts, but
individual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligent
act would have their personal assets protected from debts arising from
that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner, and
all LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP
would be required to provide a #5 million ($7.7 million) financial
provision - a sort of bond - for judgments against the partnership. The
draft law will be debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey,
during the first quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to the
Privy Council for sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-
end.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."

The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and there
would be no change to their UK tax arrangements. The Jersey option is
claimed to be cheaper than incorporating as a limited liability
company, an option chosen by KPMG for parts of its UK audit practice in
1995 (CAI 62). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates the
saving could be as much as 10 percent of pre- tax profits, compared
with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new law
in Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects and
surveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.
Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey.

"At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then you
are liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change the
principle of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Act
of 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things
take time, and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,
the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which dates from 1907, as"not relevant to modern times".
Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary legislation
would be needed to change it, he said.

UNITED STATES:  SEC OFFICIAL URGES SPEEDY ACTION ON DERIVATIVES

MICHAEL SUTTON, chief accountant of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is urging standard-setters to move more quickly to
resolve confusion over accounting for derivatives. Addressing a recent
conference in New York, Sutton said investors need help in
understanding the risks and complexities.

"Futures are accounted for differently than swaps. Swaps are accounted
for differently than foreign currency forwards. And foreign currency
forwards are accounted for differently than foreign currency options,"
he told the annual conference on current financial reporting issues
sponsored by the Financial Executives Institute.

Sutton indicated that businesses need a single, articulated set of
guidelines to use. "There's no guidance at all in many areas," he said,
adding that"the accounting literature for swaps is badly outdated". He
said the most recent guidance can be found only in a brief 60-word
consensus published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
more than ten years ago.

FASB is currently considering two other methods for accounting for
derivatives. One would require valuing derivatives at market and
charging value changes against income if the derivatives are actively
traded, or against equity if they are long-term holdings. The other
method would charge all changes in the values of derivatives against
income.

The SEC, meanwhile, is preparing a proposal that will mandate improved
disclosure about accounting policies, require quantified information
about market risk and make companies analyse and state their
derivatives strategies. Release of the document was expected before the
end of 1995 after receiving the approval of the SEC chairman.

Sutton said the new disclosure requirements would essentially codify
many existing practices. Most companies that report derivatives
exposure use one of three methods: value-at-risk; an interest rate
sensitivity analysis; or a table of raw data showing present and future
cash flows.

ACADEMICS CRITICISE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

TWO CANADIAN academics have told the federal government that many of
the traditional proposals aimed at improving corporate governance will
not work. They suggest alternative measures that run counter to recent
suggestions, including Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) recommendations
adopted in 1995.

Their report was commissioned by the federal government as background
for debate on the upcoming review of the Canada Business Corporations
Act, planned for 1997.

Ronald Daniels, dean of law at Toronto University, and Randall Morck, a
business professor at Alberta University, believe that issues such as
the size of boards of directors or the level of insider ownership of a
company are largely irrelevant.

The two professors say the government should neither encourage or
discourage insider ownership of companies because there is no evidence
that concentrated ownership leads to a poorer performance. They also
suggest that there is no point in separating the roles of chief
executive and chairman of the board and say governments should not try
to control the size of boards.

In contrast, the TSE has said that companies should not have large,
unwieldy boards, has called for the separation of the roles of chief
executive and chairman, and wants the board composed largely of outside
directors.

The professors would, however, like to see increased focus on what they
consider the root of one of the most important corporate governance
issues: non-arms'-length transactions between related companies, also
known as self-dealing. "This deals with the actual problem, not with
the symptoms of the problem," Morck said.

The professors recommend that all companies with a dominant shareholder
set up a special conduct committee of entirely independent outside
directors to review any proposed internal transactions.

While they do not see the need to change current laws requiring at
least two independent directors on every board, they want the
government to tighten the definition of independence. They point out
that many so-called outside directors are company lawyers, advertising
executives or senior managers of companies with close business
relationships. "Outside directors should be outsiders," Morck
said."They should have no relationship whatever with the company."

The professors also recommend that directors be paid only in stock or
stock options, because that would align their interests with those of
the shareholders. They also want directors to be held liable in class-
action suits by shareholders, but only after the government has clearly
defined the limits of that liability, which they say should not extend
beyond the change in value to a company measured by the value of the
decline in share price.

TWO TIE FOR `EXCELLENT' ANNUAL REPORTING AWARD

FOR THE first time in the 45-year history of the Financial Post annual
corporate reporting awards, two companies have tied for the top honour,
the Award of Excellence. The Bank of Montreal and manufacturer Nova
Corp were lauded for their "clear, effective" annual reports, described
by the judges as "shining and brilliant".

Awards are handed out in 13 categories, including various resource
groups, manufacturing, hi-tech, media, telecommunications, utilities,
merchandisers, financial institutions and conglomerates. As well, the
Post bestows annual environmental awards.

The tie seems to reflect the overall improvement in the quality of
annual reports, said Philip Creighton, co-ordinator of the judges who
represent the awards sponsors, the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants, the Canadian Investor Relations Institute and the Toronto
Society of Financial Analysts.

"The field is getting better," Creighton said, adding that there is
still room for improvement. For example, in the hi-tech sector - a new
class this year - it was often difficult to tell what a particular
company was selling.

"I think it depends on how mature the industry is and how long it has
been worrying about these problems," Creighton said. "The basic
industries have made tremendous progress in being able to write about
their processes in a fashion that is understandable and in supplying
information. I can remember when all those industries were as bad as hi-
tech is now."

The Bank of Montreal was chosen as the winner in its category and for
the Award of Excellence because of its excellent separate financial
goals and measures section, which "provides insight into the bank's
performance . . . The only weakness noted is consistent with all the
bank reports reviewed - very limited revenue, cost and capital
segmentation information."

Nova Corp's report was praised as "a brilliant annual report loaded
with extensive disclosure and meaningful segmented information on all
operations".

The Award of Excellence in the environmental awards went to Northern
Telecom. "Not only has Nortel issued an interesting and informative
report, but it has distinguished itself from other companies through
continued efforts to improve the quality of its environmental
reporting," the judges said.

They particularly liked its"Lifecycle" approach, which looks at the
company's products from concept to consumption, and clearly describes
the potential impact those goods have on the environment. And the
judges were especially pleased with Nortel's decision to produce fewer
hard copies of the environmental report, making it available on the
company's World Wide Web site instead.

TORONTO PLANS HIGH PENALTIES FOR MISINFORMATION

A COMMITTEE of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) has proposed that
company directors, officers and advisers should each pay a minimum fine
of C$25,000 ($18,500) or 50 percent of their annual compensation if
they issue misleading information about their companies.

In an interim report released on December 7, the committee said
companies should be held accountable for the timeliness and accuracy of
their information. The committee was set up a year ago in response to
recommendations made by the TSE's corporate governance study.

"Although [Canadian] disclosure requirements are currently high, there
is enough non-compliance to cause concern," said Thomas Allen, a
corporate lawyer and chairman of the committee. "The remedies to
parties who are injured by lack of disclosure are clearly inadequate."

Allen said his committee's recommendations would give those suffering
losses as a result of inadequate or misleading disclosure reasonable
opportunities to recover those losses.

The committee also suggested that companies pay a minimum fine of C$1
million or 5 percent of their market capitalisation - whichever is
higher - for misinformation. As well, major shareholders would be
liable for unlimited sanctions if they knowingly influence company
officials to release inaccurate information.

Another recommendation was to broaden civil liability to include so-
called continuous disclosure documents, such as quarterly financial
reports and press releases. Currently, companies and directors are
liable only for incorrect information in a prospects or takeover
circular.

Moreover, investors would be able to seek damages from experts, such as
consultants, if their advice leads to misinformation. The liability
ceiling for experts would be the greater of C$1 million or three times
the annual fees they receive from the company.

"We think [the penalties] are enough to get corporate Canada's
attention but not so much that it risks dramatically injuring corporate
Canada," Allen said.

He acknowledged that the recommendations will force companies to spend
more money to ensure that corporate documents are accurate. "We think
that the cost, whatever it is, is more than offset by the benefit to
Canadian markets of the repute in which they will be held by virtue of
enhanced disclosure."

Although Edward Waitzer, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission,
hailed the report as "an outstanding piece of work", one of the TSE
committee members thinks it does not go far enough. According to
Toronto lawyer Philip Anisman, C$25,000 "would not provide a level of
compensation for investors that would warrant a class, or even an
individual, action".

In a dissenting statement on the report, Anisman wrote:"It is also
questionable whether it would provide adequate deterrence. The ceiling
on directors' or officers' liability should be the greater of at least
C$100,000 or their total compensation during the year preceding the
disclosure violation."

Anisman also pointed out that the committee's recommendations contain
several loopholes that lessen the impact of the sanctions. For example,
they exclude professional advisers, such as accountants and lawyers,
from liability.

The public has until March to comment on the proposals.

AUDITORS' MEETING TO FOCUS ON INTERNET SECURITY

THE FLORIDA-based Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), a leader in
auditing technology and research, will give auditors a hands- on
opportunity to navigate the Internet at a February conference in St
Petersburg. The conference will also address the Internet's many
security issues and concerns.

"The Internet is an open system and wasn't designed to be secure," said
Jim Kates, the consultant in charge of conference activities. "People
using the system usually aren't thinking about whether the data they
are transmitting is confidential or sensitive or not," he said, adding
that there are few products on the market today that can help keep a
system secure.

Kates said this is especially problematic when the Internet is used for
electronic commerce. A system still needs to be devised for the sale of
securities and the transmission of confidential information that relies
on mutual integrity and mutual authentication of buyer and seller and
where the integrity of the data remains authentic, he said.

"There are some security products on the market, but they can be
illegally accessed," he said. "It's useless to perform a transaction if
at any point in time it can be intercepted and changed."

Kates said that, as for now, an auditor's best use of the Internet is
as a reference source or marketing tool. "An auditor completing an
environmental audit can find information on how to dispose of waste
more easily," he said. "Or a firm can search the net to find out how
its new product stacks up against potential competition.

"There's a bulletin board where auditors can discuss audit issues.
There are search utilities an accountant can use that will seek out
information for him, by using key words, like `bank securities fraud'."

IIA, like all major accounting bodies, has its own on-line base for
sending pictures and text to members and other interested parties.

FASB SEEKS STANDARDISATION

James R Peterson reports on FASB's efforts to develop accounting rules
for the booming market in financial assets

THE US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is close to
completing a major effort to standardise accounting for transfers of
financial assets. A preliminary draft of the proposal has been
available for comment since October, and the board is encouraging
participation at a hearing on the proposal scheduled for late February.

"The proposal breaks new ground in resolving long-standing questions
about whether transactions should be accounted for as secured
borrowings or as sales," said FASB project manager Halsey Bullen. "The
board wanted to develop an approach that would be responsive to
developments in the financial markets and have some consistency and
rigour to it," he told CAI.

"There are any number of financial assets traded in today's booming
financial markets," he said. "This proposal will enable people to find
sound answers to questions on how to account for new kinds of
transfers, such as securitisations, where you take a set of assets and
tailor them to an investor's desire for a certain predictability in
cashflows and control over risk."

The proposal covers transactions which until now were treated
separately in accounting, such as securitisations, sales of partial
interests, repurchase agreements, securities lending, loan syndications
and participations, sales of receivables with recourse, and servicing
of mortgages and other loans.

The document states that "the new standards would provide accounting
and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets
and extinguishments of financial assets." Those standards would be
based on consistent application of the accounting method known as the
"financial components approach", which has to do with the issue of
control, a word that is central to any understanding of the new
proposal.

If a company has surrendered control over the transferred assets, the
transaction would be considered a sale. Otherwise, it would be
accounted for as a secured borrowing.

A company would have to recognise all financial assets and servicing it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred after a transfer of
financial assets. It would also have to remove from the balance sheet
those assets it no longer controls and those liabilities that it has
satisfied.

In FASB's proposal, a lender has surrendered control only if all of the
following conditions are met:

* The transferred assets have been isolated from the lender beyond its
reach and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership.

* The lender obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred
assets.

* Any agreement to repurchase the assets can be satisfied by delivery
of assets that are readily obtainable.

* The transfer is not temporary.

The plan would require that liabilities entered into as part of a
transfer of financial assets initially be measured at fair value, if
practical. It would require servicing assets to be measured by
allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold and
retained interests based on their relative fair values on the transfer
date.

The FASB proposal also addresses the issue of loan impairment. After a
transfer, servicing assets and liabilities would be subsequently
measured by amortisation over the period of estimated net servicing
income, with impairment to be recognised if the carrying amount of
unamortised servicing assets at risk exceeds their fair value.

The proposal would allow elimination of a liability from the balance
sheet only if a debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its
obligation for the liability, or if a debtor is legally released from
primary obligation for the liability by the creditor or by the courts.

Bullen expects the proposal to spark some controversy. He said
companies that find they must report as a sale what they've been
reporting as borrowing will not like it because they may have to
recognise a loss.

The proposal could also dampen the use of "repos", or repurchase
agreements by banks. FASB wants to reclassify all repurchase agreements
more than three months long as sales. At present, repos, in which one
party sells securities to another and agrees to buy them back at a
specified price at a specified time, are treated as collateralised
loans.

Banks are currently able to classify repos as "held to maturity" and do
not have to mark them to market prices on a regular basis. If repos are
classified as sales, banks would have to mark the securities they sell
to market and account for any gains or losses.

Bullen, meanwhile, expects some heated discussion about FASB's plan to
eliminate the distinction between normal servicing and excess servicing
of mortgages. This change might allow an inefficient mortgage servicer
incurring costs exceeding receivables to account for the transaction in
the same way as a more efficient servicer.

While constructing its new approach, FASB looked closely at the
International Accounting Standards Committee's proposed international
account standard on Financial Instruments, which would permit
derecognition of financial assets and liabilities upon transfer of
"substantially" all underlying risks and rewards.

FASB found this standard insufficiently consistent because it is open
to varied interpretations.

When approved, the proposal will supersede a number of FASB standards,
including Statement 76, Extinguishment of Debt, and Statement 77,
Reporting by Transferor for Transfers of Receivables with Recourse.

It would also amend Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, to clarify that a security
may not be classified as held-to-maturity if it can be prepaid or
settled so that the holder of the security would not recover
substantially all of its investment.

OIL GIANTS HIT BY NEW FASB RULE

A new standard dealing with impairment of long-lived assets is set to
take its toll on the fourth-quarter earnings of US oil companies. James
R Peterson reports

SHAREHOLDERS WILL see their dividends from US oil and gas stocks
reduced as companies come to grips with a new standard, Accounting for
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, from the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB).

The move is unlikely to cause unusual concern, however, because the
effect on dividends will be temporary, affecting earnings in a single
quarter, and because the new accounting rule ultimately will allow
shareholders to better predict a company's future earnings.

Texaco is taking a fourth-quarter charge of $640 million, which
analysts say will swing the company's quarterly results into a loss.
Earlier this year, Burlington Resources, Ashland and Phillips Petroleum
respectively took $304 million, $90 million and $49 million in charges.
Besides Texaco, at least two other oil giants, Mobil and Chevron,
expect to take big charges related to the new FASB rule.

The new rule, Standard 121, was implemented so that investors could
better assess the true worth of a company's assets. The new rule calls
for all US companies to compare the future expected values of assets
against current book value. If the future values are less than book,
the company must write down the value of that asset.

Oil and gas companies are particularly affected by the rule change
because it is the first time they have had to assess each of their
producing fields on a case-by-case basis. Under a previous informal
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule, oil fields were
evaluated on a nationwide or worldwide basis. The SEC allowed the firms
to offset those fields that had a value less than book against others
with higher values.

"Aside from the SEC rule for the oil and gas industries, there was no
standard for impairment of fixed assets until FASB adopted the current
standard last spring," according to FASB project manager Carmen Bailey,
who said it is hard to predict which other industries are facing large
write-downs.

George Batavick, Texaco's assistant comptroller, emphasised that the
company's fourth-quarter write-down is a one-time-only, non- cash event
and that the assets in question are only technically impaired. "The
assets are producing positive earnings and positive cash flow," he
said. "But since the cash flow on an undiscounted basis would not
recover the investment that is on our books, the FASB rule necessitated
a write-down."

"Under the old SEC rule, we looked at our producing oil fields in the
aggregate," Batavick explained. "In the aggregate, we had high
investment fields being paired with low investment fields and the cash
flows exceeded the total investment. However, on a field-by-field
basis, the individual cashflows of particular high investment fields
were not recovered by the cashflows."

The write-down was based on Texaco's estimate of the current and future
value of each of its oil fields. "If you have acquired a property when
its price was high, and today's prices are lower, the carrying value of
the asset must be reduced to come into line with today's prices and
what we expect the value of the property will be in the future."

Batavick said the question of valuing assets becomes a problem when a
company acquires a large firm with highly valued assets. Key to
Texaco's write-down is its recent acquisition of Getty Oil Company.
"Investors ought to feel more secure," he said, "because the write-down
would otherwise have been reported as a depreciation expense in future
years."

The new rule establishes standards for "impairment of long- lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those
assets to be held and used", and also for"long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of".

The original scope of the FASB project was limited to accounting for
the impairment of long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles. The
board decided to include goodwill related to impaired assets after
deciding that long-lived assets could not be tested for impairment
without also considering the goodwill arising from the acquisition of
those assets.

The board also decided to include depreciation in the scope of its
project because it found that the choice of depreciation method and
estimates of useful life of an asset could have an impact on whether an
impairment exists. FASB suggests that an asset's depreciation method
should be reviewed periodically and changed if current estimates of the
asset's value differ significantly from previous estimates.

The history of Standard 121 extends to July 1980 when the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) urged FASB to provide more accounting
guidance for the impairment of fixed assets. No action was taken until
the mid-1980s when FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) took up the
issue. EITF members, noting a significant increase in the size and
frequency of write-downs of long-lived assets, suggested there was a
need for a single rule.

In 1989, a report by the Institute of Management Accountants revealed a
continuing steady increase in write-downs and called for more
authoritative guidance on accounting for impairment of long-lived
assets.

As a result of these recommendations, FASB added a project to its
agenda in 1988 and issued for comment a discussion memorandum,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable
Intangibles. The final exposure draft, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,
was issued last year and the new standard was adopted last March.

Standard 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15 1995. However, some firms, like Texaco,
have chosen early application of the rule.

A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH

Following publication of an extensive study of international accounting
practices, Gerry Acher, KPMG's head of audit and accounting in the UK,
traces the background to the IASC's new- found prominence

IT IS increasingly recognised that international accounting standards
are a force to be reckoned with - as demonstrated by the publication in
December of TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting - and the man who
ignores them risks being left by the wayside while others set the pace.

In essence, their importance arises because international standards are
needed and international accounting standards (IASs) fit the bill,
having been markedly improved in recent years.

When the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was
founded in 1973, part of the dream was that a single set of standards
would allow a company to raise finance anywhere in the world. That
dream has become a pressing need. Companies around the world grapple
with other people's standards in order to tap foreign capital markets.

In particular, entry to US capital markets is open only to those who
prepare their financial statements in accordance with US accounting
principles, or who reconcile their domestic financial statements to
these principles. There are a few exemptions from this for specific
areas of accounting.

What irks companies is not so much the differences in the rules
themselves as the fact that they are another country's rules; the firms
have had no input to the development of these rules, and there is a
little bit of national pride at work. For example, some European
countries feel particularly aggrieved when they are required to use US
GAAP.

With the world as its constituency, the IASC does not have this
problem. Almost everyone has reached this conclusion. The German
Government has let it be known that it will tolerate the use of IASs
for domestic purposes. The issue is also under consideration in France.
The European Commission has also softened its stance. There were early
mutterings of a Euro-ASB, but in the end, reason triumphed over bad
habit. The commission wants to work with the IASC and to allow European
companies to prepare their consolidated accounts under IASs.

Most significantly, however, capital market regulators across the
world, in the form of the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO), have reached a milestone agreement with the IASC.
IOSCO agrees that the current list of IASs contains a nucleus of
acceptable standards. Moreover, it will work with the IASC to try to
ensure that 15 new or revised IASs, to be issued by 1999, will also be
acceptable to IOSCO. If that can be achieved, IOSCO will endorse the
IASs for use in listings anywhere in the world. In theory this includes
New York, and the achievement of this is a prime goal of the exercise.
London already accepts IASs.

Improvement

That IASs have reached this position is a testament to their
improvement in recent years. At one time they were thought of as the
lowest common denominator. But during almost ten years in office, David
Cairns, former IASC secretary-general, steered the organisation through
a major revisions project, cutting out many of the optional treatments,
and bringing it to the top table among the standard-setters.

Cairns's successor, Sir Bryan Carsberg, who brings to his role
considerable authority and experience in the accounting and political
fields, now talks on equal terms with his counterparts at, for example,
the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the American Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In the list of five bodies
collaborating on recent international studies on future events, hedging
and provisioning, you will find the IASC.

National standard-setters want international convergence as far as
possible, and not purely from a theoretical viewpoint; convergence has
strong practical attractions too.

First, there are obvious advantages in borrowing, or participating in,
others' research. Countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong take this
approach to its ultimate conclusion and base their accounting systems
directly on IASs.

And second, there are real benefits for preparers and users. It would
be a genuine convenience for international groups to have the same set
of accounting principles for local and group reporting. When companies
do cross-border mergers and acquisitions they become users of
accounting information. If the two parties spoke the same accounting
language it would be one less obstacle to deal-making. And it would be
good economics. The better everyone understands the information, the
better the resource-allocation decisions will be.

How are standard-setters pursuing this goal? They now look to the
IASC's work as the reference point. The UK's ASB does this. Most of its
proposals regard developments at the IASC. For example, the draft
Statement of Principles owes much to the IASC's Framework. In addition,
the appendices to FRS 4 and FRS 7 go to the trouble of explaining why
it was felt necessary to depart from IASs in those standards. But we do
not just respond to the IASC; with Sir David Tweedie newly appointed to
the IASC board, the UK's standard-setting body is strongly represented
in the process.

Principles

I am particularly pleased that principles rather than rules are the
basis of the international standards. We must fight to retain this
general approach, and not allow the standards to drift towards a cook-
book approach. The differences from our own standards are limited,
although sometimes significant.

For example, the IAS definition of a merger is very similar to the
UK's. And like FRS 6, merger accounting must be adopted if the
definition is met; acquisition accounting applies in other cases.
Acquisition accounting itself is very similar but, crucially, it would
accommodate the acquirer's intentions, such as reorganisations, in the
fair value exercise. The end product of this is goodwill. Here a major
difference crops up.

Under IAS 22, positive goodwill must be capitalised and amortised over
up to 20 years. Negative goodwill is used to reduce the values assigned
to the non-monetary acquired assets and any remaining amount treated as
deferred income, to be spread over up to 20 years. Alternatively, the
whole amount may be dealt with as deferred income.

The UK approach is largely to write off goodwill directly to reserves.
While this is under review, it seems likely that even if the UK
requires goodwill to be capitalised, the amortisation requirement will
differ significantly from that of IAS 22.

It is important to be aware of such differences and of the future
direction of the international standard-setters. If convergence of
standards - or at least an acceptable set of international standards -
is to be achieved, more interest in their development is necessary than
has been shown hitherto.

Staying with intangible assets for a moment, development costs are
another area of difference. Under IAS 9, if certain conditions are met,
then development costs must be capitalised (and subsequently
amortised). For those who think that the IASC takes its lead from the
US this is a salutary lesson; under US GAAP, development costs are
never capitalised.

Like the UK, IAS 16 permits fixed assets to be revalued. Unlike the UK,
it requires revaluations to be done on a class-by-class basis and to be
kept up to date. If such a requirement was in force in the UK then many
of the anomalies of its present mixed system would be alleviated.

Accounting for financial instruments - including derivatives - is a
problem for everyone. At present, the IASC has a standard covering
disclosure and presentation (IAS 32). No standard-setter yet has a
comprehensive measurement standard. The IASC aims to have one by June
1997. In the meantime, IAS 32 should keep preparers, auditors and users
occupied. Its disclosures of credit risk, fair values and hedges are
demanding and informative. Its presentation rules are innovative.

Freed from the constraints of a legal framework, the IASC is able to
require companies to report preference shares that contain an
obligation as debt. On top of that, hybrid instruments, such as
convertible debt, are to be split into debt and equity elements and
separately accounted for.

Some of the other differences from UK standards are as follows:

* Jointly-controlled entities may be proportionately consolidated;
jointly-controlled assets must be proportionately consolidated. (Only
unincorporated joint ventures may use this treatment in the UK).

* The cumulative exchange differences on the net investment in a
foreign entity are presented as a component of equity. They are
subsequently taken into the calculation of profit or loss on any
disposal of the foreign entity. There are no such requirements in the
UK.

* When translating the financial statements of a foreign entity, the
profit and loss account should be translated at the actual or average
rates. The UK also permits the closing rate to be used.

* The minority interest in a subsidiary may be based on the relevant
share of the pre-acquisition book values of the subsidiary, as opposed
to the fair value as mandated in the UK.

* The current portion of long-term debt may be excluded from current
liabilities where the company can and intends to refinance it on a long-
term basis. This is not generally possible under the UK's FRS 4.

* Only a major line of business could qualify as a discontinued
operation. The UK definition refers to a material effect on the nature
and focus of operations. Moreover, the discontinued operation's profit
on ordinary activities - that is, before extraordinary items and thus
after interest and tax - must be disclosed. Discontinued interest and
tax need not be disclosed in the UK.

* Extraordinary items are more possible. IAS 8 cites earthquakes and
expropriation of assets as examples. Such events would be within
ordinary activity under the UK's FRS 3.

As mentioned earlier, 15 new or revised standards are expected from the
IASC by 1999. In part these will fill gaps in the portfolio - for
example, at present there are no comprehensive standards on
presentation (i.e. the form of accounts) or on earnings per share. But
there are also some contentious issues in the pipeline. In addition to
a measurement standard for financial instruments, a revised standard on
deferred tax (due soon) and a new standard on intangibles (due in June
1996) are on the way. These last two present difficulties of
harmonisation.

Fundamental

The UK and the US use fundamentally different bases for both
recognition and measurement of deferred tax. The UK recognition basis
is the well known timing differences approach, whereas the US seeks to
recognise the tax that would arise on a realisation of all of the
assets and liabilities at their book values, known as the temporary
differences approach. The UK, increasingly the international odd-man-
out, provides only partially for timing differences; the US provides in
full for its temporary differences.

There is no synthesis of these two systems; whichever way the IASC's
judgment goes - and the indications are that they will find in favour
of the US bases - discord will be the result.

With intangibles, the issue is the extent to which they can be
separated from goodwill. In the UK, the current proposal would allow,
for example, an acquired brand to be separated out where its fair value
could be reliably measured. The IASC's proposal (E50) agrees in
principle. However, it does not regard a measurement based on
discounted future revenues - as is typically the case for brands - as
sufficiently distinct from the measurement of goodwill to merit
separate recognition.

The IASC has come a long way. In the field of accounting developments
it has moved, unnoticed by many, from the rearguard to the van. But the
campaign is not over yet. If the world is to move forward we must
achieve the goal of listing on a US exchange under IAS. This is what
the IASC is fighting for; it deserves our attention, co-operation and
support.

TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting is published by Macmillan, price
#350, and provides a fully-comparative guide to official accounting
rules and their practical applications for 14 national regimes, plus
systematic explanations of IASC standards and the 4th and 7th EU
directives. Details can be obtained from Macmillan Direct, tel: +44

LONG TRIAL LIKELY FOR PW

One of the biggest-ever auditor lawsuits in Germany opened at the end
of November. But, as CAI reports, an early resolution of the  complex
issues involved seems unlikely

MORE THAN a year after a group of creditor banks announced a DM255
million ($180 million) lawsuit against Price Waterhouse over its audits
of two German companies brought to the brink of bankruptcy by alleged
fraud, the court case opened in Frankfurt at the end of November.

But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, the
judge quickly proposed an adjournment until after former executives of
the two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat, have been tried
on charges of criminal fraud.

The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for several
years because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes to
prove that the former executives of credit factoring company, Procedo,
and its biggest customer, sports-surface manufacturer Balsam, engaged
in fraudulent transactions that led to the collapse of both companies.
Muscat, who advised both companies, is accused of "deliberate
involvement" with the alleged frauds.

Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his case
against PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partners
acted with the intention to defraud, rather than just negligently. But
he is unwilling to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a
prolonged adjournment. After both sides had consulted with their
clients, the court planned to reconvene on December 19 to make a final
decision on the adjournment.

The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of "intentional misconduct"
in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approving
the accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added a
new claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval without
actually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.

The alleged fraud centres on Procedo's factoring transactions with
Balsam which led it to advance cash to the manufacturing company in
return for collecting its trade receivables. Prosecutors claim the
factored invoices were doctored to make Balsam's turnover look bigger
than it was. Balsam filed for bankruptcy in June 1994 after its top
management was arrested on suspicion of fraud, a move that precipitated
Procedo's petition for protection from its creditors. The biggest
casualties were the companies' bankers which claim to be owed DM2.3
billion.

PW's involvement stems from its audits of Balsam, which it undertook
jointly with a Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, FMP. Muscat, a partner in
both PW and FMP, audited Procedo in an individual capacity. He was
arrested in August 1994 on charges of fraud.

In an interview with CAI, PW's senior partner in Germany, Wolfgang
Krause, said his firm may have to be bailed out by PW's European firm
if the creditor banks are awarded the legal damages they are seeking.

Krause said PW Europe would "naturally" provide financial support since
the German practice has no funds to pay an out-of- court settlement,
let alone the full sum of DM255 million for which it is being sued. "We
don't have any possibility to build reserves," he said, citing the high
cost of personnel, information technology, training and liability
insurance in Germany.

That insurance, however, is unlikely to cover the millions PW could end
up paying as a result of the Balsam/Procedo lawsuit. In remarks about
the German accounting profession in general, Ulf Pohl, managing
director of Wirtschaftliche Versicherungsstellethe, the leading
provider of professional indemnity insurance cover for accountants in
Germany, said firms invariably take up "substantially less" than the
maximum cover of DM70 million that he offers.

Moreover, Pohl said German corporate law makes it impossible for
accountancy firms to insure against "intentional misconduct" by their
partners. In the Balsam/Procedo suit, PW and six of its partners are
accused of precisely that misdemeanour.

While the court action is now under way, PW still hopes it can reach
agreement out of court. "Our legal counsel is strongly urging us to see
the case through, but we don't want this business to go for another ten
years," Krause said.

Meanwhile, there is little evidence that PW has been damaged by the
unfavourable publicity generated by the lawsuit. Only six partners have
left or retired (including Muscat and Gerd Frielingsdorf, two of those
named in the suit), and fee income continues to rise.

Provisional figures for the year to the end of last June showed gross
revenues of DM253 million, up 5.4 percent from the previous year.
Revenues for 1995/96 are projected at DM275 million.

Those figures make PW the smallest of the Big Six in Germany, but
Krause explained that the firm's approach to the market differs from
that of its larger competitors. Its share of statutory audit work is
probably smaller than that of any other major German firm; instead it
focuses on audit-related projects such as due diligence, treasury
management, internal audit consulting and balance sheet planning for
companies which are not statutory audit clients.

Like PW firms in other markets, the German firm likes to regard all its
professionals as"consultants". Many assignments are awarded in
connection with mergers and acquisitions where PW's corporate finance
subsidiary has acted as a consultant. In fiscal 1995, audit work
accounted for 40 percent of fee income compared with 43 percent the
year before. At other Big Six firms in Germany, the figure is around 60
percent.

TRYING TO AGREE ON GLOBAL STANDARDS

Niall Brady reviews the financial reporting developments that hit the
headlines in 1995

IN THE tortured history of the search for a global accounting language,
1995 will be remembered as something of a watershed. After years of
dancing round the issue, the world's stock market regulators finally
came to an agreement with the International Accounting Standards
Committee (IASC) on a timetable for a set of core standards that would
be acceptable for cross-border listings and capital raising.

Having been dismissed for years as a well-intentioned but ineffectual
standard-setter, the IASC could not conceal its delight. Australian
Michael Sharpe, who took over the role of IASC chairman on July 1,
hailed the agreement with the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO) as an "historic moment".

"Companies should now feel confident that the IASC and IOSCO are fully
committed to developing IASs that will be acceptable everywhere in the
world and recognise the efficiencies that may be obtained from using
IASs," he said. "At the moment, companies using IAS standards can raise
capital on many global stock exchanges. Now they know that they will be
able to access all of them in the not-too-distant future. Not just
whole companies, but whole countries will now move to IAS rules."

Amid the jubilation, however, the huge task facing the IASC between now
and the end of the decade must not be underestimated. Included in the
15 standards that the IASC has agreed to issue or revise at IOSCO's
behest are some of accounting's most controversial issues, such as
financial instruments, intangible assets and leasing.

Even if the IASC manages to stick with its ambitious timetable, its new
and revised standards would still have to be endorsed by IOSCO's
technical committee before they can be recognised as acceptable for
cross-border listings in all capital markets. The final hurdle will be
getting the national securities regulators to recognise IASs in their
rule books.

The stance adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
which regulates entry to the world's biggest capital market, will be
especially important. Domestic US companies are determined that they
should not have to compete head-on for the same capital with foreign
registrants that are not subject to the full rigours of US GAAP.

Research unveiled in the spring of 1995 suggests, however, that the gap
between IASs and US GAAP may not be as wide as is generally thought.
According to Trevor Harris, the accounting professor at New York's
Columbia University, who undertook the study: "We found that at least
for firms utilising the IASC's revised International Accounting
Standards there are few instances, especially from an investor's
perspective as opposed to a technical accounting perspective, where the
companies' compliance with IASs would not meet US GAAP."

Harris also noted that endorsement of IASs would not necessarily weaken
the SEC's hand. "If the SEC believes a company is hurting investors by
obfuscating the information, despite apparent compliance with IASs,
then it can still impose its regulatory control if the company is
registered," he said.

With so much attention to keeping the Americans on side, some of the
IASC's other power brokers are concerned that their interests are being
pushed to one side. Those concerns have been heightened with the
realisation that political squabbles about the future direction of IASs
are being overtaken by events on the ground, as more multinational
companies switch to US GAAP in return for entry to the New York Stock
Exchange.

The hegemony of US GAAP led the European Commission, in particular, to
signal that it might intervene to halt the slide. Addressing a meeting
of European accountants at the end of 1994, John Mogg, the commission's
director general for the internal market and financial services, said:
"We must recognise that Europe cannot escape its own responsibility to
shape accounting standards. We cannot be merely reactive to the
solutions put forward by others."

Mogg's sentiments were amplified by Karel van Hulle, head of the
commission's accounting standards unit. After acknowledging the
shortcomings of the commission's existing accounting directives during
an address to the European Accounting Association in May, van Hulle
added: "We have to change our approach in the area of financial
reporting or the European input into the debate will diminish. I
disagree with those who argue that this is a good thing. Something has
to be done to prevent the directives becoming a burden on progress."

Such talk raised fears inside and outside Europe that Brussels was
preparing to go it alone in harmonising the accounting practices of the
EU's 15 member states. Those fears, however, were eventually put to
rest at IOSCO's annual conference in July, when Mario Monti, the
commissioner responsible for accounting policy, signalled that Brussels
would seek to work through the IASC as the best way to harmonise
accounting practices both within the EU's member states and with the
outside world.

"Agreement on IASs would enable us to enter negotiations with other
regions aimed at securing mutual recognition of public offer and
listing prospectuses based on these same IASs," Monti said. "We believe
companies should only be required to prepare one set of consolidated
accounts, and we plan to examine the possibility for European companies
with an international vocation to prepare their consolidated accounts
on the basis of IASs."

Brussels' embrace of IASs is also mirrored by a realisation among some
heavyweight EU member states that, rather than fretting from the
sidelines about the IASC's perceived Anglo-Saxon bias, it is better to
make their voices heard by playing a more active role in the
deliberations of the global standard-setter. Most European countries,
however, are hampered by the fact that they do not have strong standard-
setting bodies, such as the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) or
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the US, which could
fly their flags at the IASC.

France, for one, is set to remedy that situation with the announcement
by economy minister Jean Arthuis that he plans to set up a state body
with the power to issue binding pronouncements on financial reporting.
Addressing the 50th congress of the country's professional accountancy
body, the Ordre des Experts Comptables, Arthuis warned that France's
existing accounting regime, which is based on legislation rather than
private-sector standards, "is threatened with sclerosis".

A key feature of Arthuis's proposed Comite de la Reglementation
Comptable (CRC) is that its pronouncements would draw heavily on IASs.
That could remove a big obstacle facing capital-hungry European
companies: the need to prepare multiple, and often contradictory,
accounts to satisfy the needs of both domestic regulators and overseas
stock markets. "I would like to say that I find this ambiguous
situation unacceptable," Arthuis said. "It leads to questions about the
truthfulness of the accounts of large French companies and is
detrimental to their credibility."

The half-year results of Pechiney provided a prime example of what
Arthuis was referring to. In the run-up to its planned November
privatisation, the aluminium and packaging group switched to US GAAP
and reported a Fr658 million ($130 million) profit for the six months
to the end of June.

But France's stock market regulator, the Commission des Operations de
Bourse (COB), took exception to Pechiney's new accounting policies,
highlighting the fact that if it had stuck with local reporting
requirements it would have reported a small loss for the period. The
uncharacteristically public rebuke from the COB came at a bad time for
Pechiney, as its shares were already facing general indifference from
investors.

Pechiney's predicament is familiar to companies in neighbouring
Germany. Because its accounting traditions are so out of step with what
is demanded by international investors, Germany has been forced to
undertake a fundamental rethink of its approach to financial reporting.

A radical solution emerged from Bonn in the spring of 1995 when justice
ministry official Herbert Biener proposed that German companies with
global ambitions could be allowed to use IASs or US GAAP for their
consolidated financial statements and would only have to respect
domestic accounting requirements in individual company financial
statements.

Biener's proposals come at a time when another German company - this
time the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom - is
preparing to follow the lead of Daimler-Benz and list its shares in New
York. Unless Biener's proposal finds its way onto the statute books by
early next year, however, Telekom will find itself in the same
predicament as Daimler: having to issue two different sets of group
results, one that complies with German accounting regulations, the
other with US GAAP.

For both companies, a crucial aspect of Biener's proposal is that US
GAAP would be an equally-acceptable alternative to IASs as a basis for
drafting consolidated accounts. Their interest lies in removing
obstacles to listing their shares in New York, and the SEC will not
accept accounts drawn up on the basis of IASs.

Such a radical solution, however, is causing unease in some quarters of
Germany's corporate establishment. Companies like Bayer and Hoechst
have never accepted what they see as Daimler's capitulation to the
excessive demands of the SEC in terms of disclosure. Instead, they
favour IASs (Bayer adopted IASs for its 1994 accounts; Hoechst planned
to do so for its 1995 financial statements) because, unlike the
formulation of US GAAP, Germany has an input into IASs and
representation on the board of the IASC.

Sharpe summed up their fears in an address to the Federation of Euro-
Asian Stock Exchanges at the beginning of October. "I believe that it
is unacceptable that a sovereign state de facto delegates to another
state the drawing up of their accounting standards," he said.
"Delegating to an international institution in which many sovereign
states have their say is one thing, whereas delegating to another state
is quite another."

Germany is also divided on the need for a national standard- setting
body along the lines of France's proposed CRC. According to Johannes
Maret, Arthur Andersen's senior partner in Frankfurt: "A standard-
setting body would be responsible for exacting greater influence in the
formulation of IASs and checking whether these were compatible with
German law."

On the other hand, Dietrich Dorner, outgoing president of the
professional body for German accountants, the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprufer, believes the need for a consensus approach in
standard-setting would weaken the standard of financial reporting in
Germany.

"I'm not optimistic that [a standard-setting body] would be any better
than what we have at the moment," he told CAI in November. "It would
pronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effect
would be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."

Whatever route German companies eventually take to make their accounts
more useful to international investors, it is clear that the existing
practice of making generous provisions for a wide variety of possible
liabilities and losses will have to be curbed. While billed as an
example of German accounting's conservative bent, over-generous
provisions are also a classic devise for smoothing earnings by
depressing profits in good years and bumping up the bottom lines when
times are bad.

The IASC took aim at that practice at the end of November with a
discussion paper which proposes that provisions for future operating
losses should be banned except where they result from contractual
commitments. A similar line was taken in separate documents issued by
standard-setters in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, which had
worked with the IASC on the provisions issue.

Unveiling the UK discussion paper, ASB chairman David Tweedie said:
"Some will say the restriction on provisions is imprudent but we don't
want phoney liabilities . . . with forecast future losses we sometimes
get into psychoanalytic accounting; it's like trying to read your mind.
If you want to recognise [future losses] let's have a detailed plan
first. You can't smack in phoney liabilities because you intend to
reorganise."

Such thinking goes against the current trend in the British banking
industry, which took advantage of record profits in 1995 to bump up bad-
debt provisions. Such efforts to iron out the cyclical swings that
characterise bank earnings have the blessing of regulators. "It seems
to me preferable to recognise that expected losses, particularly if
they can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, have been incurred when
a loan is written rather than waiting until the loss materialises,"
according to Bank of England executive director Brian Quinn.

And awash with profits, the banks have been more than willing to heed
Quinn's advice. Barclays Bank introduced so-called default
provisioning, involving up-front provisions based on expected losses
over the life of a loan; Lloyds Bank opted for a once-off #120 million
($200 million) boost to its general provision for bad debts based on
fears that higher inflation would hasten another economic downturn and
a desire to avoid having to raise provisions sharply in the future.

Financial instruments are an accounting issue guaranteed to dictate the
pace for both banks and their large corporate clients for some time to
come. Following explosive growth in the use of derivatives in recent
years, calls for tighter regulation of the market have been matched by
greater urgency in the push to develop accounting standards that can
deal with the complexity of financial instruments.

Even before the dramatic collapse of Barings Bank in February, the IASC
had declared that its financial instruments project "remains the
board's single highest priority for 1995 and beyond". That culminated
in the May publication of IAS 32, which deals with disclosure and
presentation issues. The fact that the standard had been in the
pipeline for six years, and that measurement and disclosure of
financial instruments remain to be tackled, demonstrate the complex and
contentious nature of the issues involved.

"Both investors and lenders need to have a much better idea of whether
risky derivatives are being used," said IASC technical director Liesel
Knorr when the standard was unveiled. "The disclosures which we are now
asking for will make it much easier to assess the risks that companies
run when they use financial instruments such as derivatives."

Meanwhile, progress on the second phase of the financial instruments
project, dealing with recognition and measurement, continues slowly,
with the next milestone expected to be a discussion paper to be issued
by the end of 1996.

That perennial bugbear of the accounting industry - goodwill and
intangible assets - continued to grab the headlines in 1995. The year
kicked off with drugs company Wellcome using the UK's lenient goodwill
requirements as part of an unsuccessful challenge to a hostile takeover
bid from pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo. Wellcome charged that Glaxo's bid
could prejudice rival bidders from overseas because they would have to
amortise the ensuing goodwill against future profits, whereas Glaxo, as
a UK company, could choose to write-off the goodwill immediately
against reserves.

Australia's Pacific Dunlop also pointed to what it perceives as the
UK's unfair advantage in goodwill amortisation in a row with regulators
during 1995. With the Australian Accounting Standards Board expected to
issue an exposure draft by year's end that requires goodwill to be
amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years, PacDun noted that
this is more onerous than the treatment permitted in the UK or in the
US and Canada, which allows goodwill to be written off over 40 years.

PacDun's concerns, however, could prove short-lived, at least as
regards the UK. In June, the ASB issued a working paper that proposes
the abolition of reserve accounting for goodwill. Tweedie outlined the
proposals as follows: "For companies wanting to take the
straightforward option, intangible assets and goodwill may be
capitalised and depreciated over a maximum of 20 years with only a
minimal annual recoverability review. On the other hand, for companies
wishing to show the critical value to their businesses of intangible
assets and goodwill, there will be no need to make an arbitrary
amortisation charge each year. Instead, continuing value can be
demonstrated by a review of future cash-flow forecasts."

That approach differs from exposure draft E50, issued by the IASC in
June, which rejected the ASB's view that some intangibles need never be
amortised. The eventual shape of a revised UK goodwill standard,
however, remains anyone's guess.

As part of a lengthy process to ensure broad-based support, the ASB
held its first-ever public hearing at the beginning of October at which
its goodwill proposals were put to the floor. With little consensus on
the specifics of the standard-setter's proposals - most disagreement
centred on the ASB's proposed impairment tests to determine if goodwill
should be subject to a once-off write down - a standard remains some
time away.
