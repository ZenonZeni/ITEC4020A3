<B>Project Title:  Programmable DC Controller<p>
Performing Organization: Jefferson Programmed Power, LLC</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Lee Ackerson (510) 865-0672 (voice)  (510) 865-0673 (fax)	</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>
	

<P>Jefferson Programmed Power is a new firm developing and manufacturing programmable, low-cost OEM DC controllers for electric vehicle use. Through the use of microprocessors and sophisticated software, these controllers will help to improve the performance and extend the range of electric vehicles with DC drive trains.   In particular, the controller should be able to make greater use of energy created through regenerative braking.  The company's goals will be to design controllers for ease of use, high-volume manufacturability, applicability, and low cost. The controllers will have a variety of parameters that can be selected and scaled by OEMs for customization, including throttle responsiveness, turbo or passing gear current limits, temperature compensated current limits, and electronically controlled braking. This new firm, Jefferson Programmed Power (JPP), will launch its operations at the CALSTART business incubator at the Alameda Naval Air Station in Northern California.  Aware of the need for such a product, a number of small electric vehicle manufacturers have agreed to test this new controller in their vehicles.
