<STRONG>From the Prodigy Service Agreement:<BR>
<BR>
5. Use of the Service</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You are responsible for providing all equipment, devices and software (other
than the<BR>
PRODIGY software) necessary to receive the Service. Prodigy will provide
telephone<BR>
numbers to connect to the Service, which for most Members will include a
local number.<BR>
You are responsible for selecting the best number for you, and for all telephone
fees and<BR>
charges associated with the use of the telephone number you select. If you
have any<BR>
question about which telephone number is best for you, check with your local
phone<BR>
company. The Service will be available during the hours stated on the Service.
Jump:<BR>
service hours. Use of the Service, and of specific telephone numbers, is
subject to<BR>
interruptions at Prodigy's discretion or beyond Prodigy's control. Unauthorized
access to<BR>
the Service, to restricted portions of the Service, or to the telecommunications
or<BR>
computer facilities used to deliver the Service, is breach of this Agreement
and a violation<BR>
of law. Membership Holders may suspend Service use by other Members in the<BR>
Membership through the means provided on the Service. Jump: member access.
Prodigy<BR>
gives the Membership Holder the ability to limit access of Members in the
Membership to<BR>
certain content available through the Service, including access to content
on the Internet<BR>
over which Prodigy exercises no control. The responsibility for controlling
Member<BR>
access to and use of these content areas is solely that of the Membership
Holder. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>IDs and Passwords. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Use of the Service requires both an ID and a password. Each new Member receives
a<BR>
unique ID and a temporary password, and must choose a new password upon<BR>
enrollment. Your ID is your address on the Service, and you and Prodigy
may disclose it<BR>
to others. Your password is the key that unlocks access to your personal
information on<BR>
the Service. Anyone knowing both your ID and password can gain access to
your<BR>
personal information and misuse it, so KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECRET; use a<BR>
password that is hard to guess (for example, do not use your first or last
name); and<BR>
change your password frequently. REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD! If you forget<BR>
your password, Prodigy may disclose it to you under security procedures
determined by<BR>
Prodigy, but reserves the right to charge for doing so. For more information
on<BR>
passwords, Jump: password security. To change your password, Jump: change<BR>
password. You may not use another Member's ID without the specific consent
of that<BR>
Member. Unauthorized use of another Member's ID, or improper solicitation
of another<BR>
Member's password, are grounds for termination of your Membership, and may
be a<BR>
violation of law. For your convenience, Prodigy provides an option that
allows you to<BR>
connect to the Service automatically, without manually entering your ID
and password<BR>
each time. Software available from third parties may also offer this function.
If you<BR>
choose to use any automatic connection function, you must understand that
anyone who<BR>
has access to your computer can also gain access to and abuse your Service
account. For<BR>
example, anyone having access to the software or computer containing your
automatic<BR>
connection information could abuse any credit, debit or charge card information<BR>
associated with your ID. <BR>

<P><STRONG>7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability to
personalize editorial<BR>
and commercial content and offerings to your interests. Personalization
is based on<BR>
information that you (or the Membership Holder) provide to Prodigy and information<BR>
derived during your use of the Service and during installation of the PRODIGY
software<BR>
on your equipment used to receive the Service. You may review or update
certain<BR>
personal information you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools feature
on the<BR>
Service. Jump: tools.<BR>
<BR>
You may be requested to supplement or update your personal information from
time to<BR>
time. All personal information that you provide on the Service must be accurate,
and<BR>
Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy may use or disclose
aggregated<BR>
(not personally identifiable) information regarding Members for any purpose.
Prodigy<BR>
will not use or disclose information specifically about you (or your Membership)
except<BR>
as permitted by this Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member
Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Jump: privacy policy. <BR>
<BR>
From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer,<BR>
communications equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY<BR>
software). Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiable
basis only to:<BR>
(i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate on your equipment;
(ii)<BR>
monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY software on your equipment;
or<BR>
(iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings that may become available
for your<BR>
equipment. When you place an order on the Service, Prodigy may provide your
name,<BR>
address, telephone number, and other relevant information to the Merchant,
including<BR>
whether you are a minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannot
and will<BR>
not be responsible for how Merchants use this information. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Company
is committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,
by maintaining the very highest privacy standards.<BR>
<BR>
Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*
[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is
associated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both information
supplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and information
we collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact that
a Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through the
service). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total number
of Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Member
has made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY service
as a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal files
on their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standards
which meet these expectations.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policy
on Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodying
our privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamental
to our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provide
Prodigy's products and services.<BR>
<BR>
These purposes are: <BR>
<BR>
- to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, and
service providers on the PRODIGY service;<BR>
- to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, including
making members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial
offerings that may be of interest;<BR>
- to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings;<BR>
- to serve members when they have questions or problems;<BR>
- to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting;<BR>
- to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;
and<BR>
- as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy's
legal department in each case.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID ends
in &quot;A&quot;) information regarding service usage by other Membership
ID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the Membership
Holder is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect the
privacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access to
personal information are required to follow specific practices concerning
its proper handling.<BR>
<BR>
3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list for
use by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communications
to members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through the
PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,
advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'
private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private while
they are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or disclose
to others the contents of these private messages except with the specific
consent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy's
legal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federal
law.<BR>
<BR>
5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.
Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derived
from private files without the member's authorization.<BR>
<BR>
Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and uphold
this Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it.<BR>
