GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE LAST DECADE OF THE 20TH CENTURY

     With this New Year, we are entering the last decade of the
Twentieth Century--a century that has thrust upon us more change
and advancement of knowledge than all of the millennia of human
history that has gone before.  It is said, for example, that one
weekday edition of The New York Times contains more knowledge
than a man in the 16th century was exposed to in a lifetime.
     The beginning of this century saw the dawn of the
communications revolution: sending messages by both wire and
through the air.  In the last half of this century, we mastered
sending messages to space and back, and created a wholly new
medium: pulses of light rather than electricity.  We have filled
the air--the spectrum--with so much information that we are
challenged to find ways to increase the capacity of our radio
systems.
     Human culture, society and personality are all functions of
communication.  Thus, each advancement in our ability to
communicate alters the fabric of culture, society, and
personality.
     Christian Schwarz-Schilling, West Germany's minister of
posts and telecommunications, reflected this when he recently
told a luncheon audience in Washington:  "Whatever may have been
responsible for the onset of the democratic movements in Poland,
Hungary and East Germany, it can be said that this would not have
happened without telecommunications.  Without telecommunications,
information on the free West would not have penetrated the
communist countries, which were sealed off from the outer world
by barbed wire and walls.  Without telecommunications, the call
for freedom would not have spread so rapidly."
     As we enter this decade, we are about to radically alter our
planet.  The miracle of flight is credited with shrinking the
Earth...of compressing time.
     The miracle of telecommunications is beginning to do
something even more miraculous: it is eliminating time and
distance all together.  It is putting the entire community of man
in instant contact with one another, and will increase the
communal power to communicate, transact and inform.
     Most other industries that are international in scope only
import and export.  Goods are produced in one country and sold in
another.  There is a growing element of that type of
international business in telecommunications as well, but there
is another, more unique, aspect to telecommunications in the
"global village": the provision of global communications requires
partnering and cooperation to a far greater degree than mere
trading.
     Some of the events of 1989 foreshadow what the telecom
business climate of the next decade will become:
     MCI and the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. have already
agreed on a protocol, and are forming a joint venture to link
their videoconferencing networks.
     AT&T wants to expand telecom circuits between the Soviet
Union and the United States using Russia's Intersputnik satellite
system.  Last month, AT&T introduced direct dialing between the
United States and Moscow.
     AT&T, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), and British Telecom
introduced digital services among their 3 countries and entered
calling card billing agreements.  They are also offering
international ISDN.  The 3 companies continue to sign agreements
with carriers in other countries expanding this international
ISDN network.
     KDD has opened offices in New York and London.
     Voicecom is partnering with British Telecom to offer voice
messaging in the United Kingdom and Europe.
     Nynex International and the Telecommunications Authority of
Singapore have agreed to cooperate on joint marketing and
technical studies.
     U S West acquired CATV companies in the United Kingdom and
Hong Kong, and is in a joint venture with Magyar Posta to build a
cellular network in Hungary.
     Telefind signed an agreement with Japan Steel Works and has
affiliations in other countries around the world to create a
global paging network.
     PacTel is part of a consortium awarded a license to build
and operate a cellular system in West Germany.  BellSouth is in a
consortium that has inaugurated cellular mobile service in Buenos
Aires.
     The U.S. Commerce Department organized telecom trade
delegations to Zurich and Vienna in Europe, and to Mexico,
Colombia and Venezuela.  It also has slated its second Southeast
Asia Telecommunications Conference in Pattaya, Thailand from Feb.
26 to March 1, 1990.
     This list is just an example of thousands of new
international business arrangements, cooperative ventures, joint
ventures, and distribution agreements that have been formed by
telecommunications companies.  Such international ventures are
not limited to the multi-billion dollar companies in the
business.  Newbridge Networks, for instance, signed a
distribution agreement with Sumitomo; formed a joint venture with
the Soviet Ministry of Radio; and, in 2 years, became the second
largest supplier of multiplexers in Europe.  Farmstead
International has formed joint ventures in China to refurbish and
market AT&T central office switches.
     The process that will drive the next decade is a closed
loop: to increase international business and commerce requires
that we provide better international communications.  The act of
creating the infrastructure for better international
communications, in turn, increases international business.
     The technical pieces are all in place:
     Voice messaging eliminates the barriers of time zones.
     The digitization of telephone networks worldwide provides
the platform.  Hong Kong, for instance, plans to have a 100%
digital network in place by 1993.
     ISDN integrates all communications media for transport.
     Fiber optics exponentially decreases the cost per circuit.
     Technologies such as facsimile, E-mail, and text-to-speech
make it possible to integrate messaging media.
     Technologies like IMMC's Ultraphone and Solarex's solar
power sources for telecom mean that sophisticated communications
can be brought affordably to areas other than those of great
population density.
     Increased processing power at a lower cost, coupled with
incredibly sophisticated programming skills, will bring
instantaneous computerized translation to communications,
eliminating the final barrier between peoples--that of language.

     *TELEPHONE NEWS salutes its readers and industry for the
giant strides it has made in the last century, and for its
emerging global perspective today.  It is even possible that the
restrictions imposed on the regional Bell operating companies
will, in the future, turn out to be blessings.  Those RBOCs that
have turned to international opportunities may, in the long run,
be stronger than if more of their resources had been devoted to
the domestic markets from which they have been barred.
     Aside from commerce, this industry has bettered our life by
such acts as bringing the deaf into the world of the hearing, it
has saved lives with enhanced 911, and it has helped integrate
our disparate peoples with multi-lingual communications systems.
     In this, the final decade of the century, you will be
uniting the world through enhanced communications planet-wide,
and in doing so, will be fostering the good will and cooperation
among men that we wished one another this past holiday season.
     TELEPHONE NEWS and Phillips Publishing wish you a happy and
prosperous New Year, and resolve to bring you another year of
news, analysis and insight to further your endeavors.

U S WEST TO OFFER NEW, AFFORDABLE  E9-1-1

     U S West Communications said that it has  developed a new
telecom service which will allow affordable Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-
1) to small and medium-sized communities.  The newly
announced service was developed over the past 2 years by U S West
Communications; U S West Advanced Technologies; Stratus
Computers; and Mitel.
     U S West will initially market the new E9-1-1 service in its
14-state service area after completing additional technical and
marketing trials.  The new architecture will also be available in
1990 to national and international customers for installation and
testing in trial sites.
     Current E9-1-1 service consists of networking that includes
facilities and routing of calls placed to 9-1-1; the database,
which includes every telephone number and service address in a
given 9-1-1 service area; and customer premise equipment (CPE).
In most cases, the database and networking portions of the
service are leased from the local telco, and are available only
through specific types of central offices (COs).  The answering
and dispatch centers, usually part of local police or government
operations, generally purchase the CPE equipment from a variety
of vendors.
     U S West Advanced Technologies developed proprietary
applications software to run the system, and Mitel's GX5000, with
a Host Command Interface protocol, provides the switching
functions.  The Stratus XA 2000 performs the necessary functions
to generate and translate information, tells the switch where to
direct the emergency phone call, and displays information about
the source of the call to E9-1-1 dispatch terminals.
U S WEST'S NEW E9-1-1 IS PORTABLE, USES ONLY 1 NETWORK, & LESS
EXPENSIVE CPE

     U S West's new E9-1-1 system contrasts from current E9-1-1
technology in that existing E9-1-1 systems require 2 separate
networks--one for voice and the caller's phone number--and the
second, a data network, retrieves and delivers the caller's
location information.  The new U S West E9-1-1 software
integrates both voice and data retrieval information into one
system, and then sends that information simultaneously to the
dispatch center.
     The new E9-1-1 platform will also allow customers to use
less expensive CPE in answering and dispatch centers.  CPE
requirements include a data terminal with 12 function keys, a
standard single line telephone, a notification device and a
printer.  In 1991, an optional interface for computer-aided
dispatching systems will be available from U S West.
     Lastly, the U S West service is portable and can be deployed
in any CO.  According to U S West, each service platform, or
feature node, will accommodate from below 30,000 subscriber lines
to over 300,000 lines, but the best economic results are realized
between 30,000 and 300,000 access lines.  Future plans include
multiple platforms that could be tied together--utilizing an
optional intertandem transfer feature--to support additional
lines.

INTERFACE WILL ALLOW NEW SERVICE TO WORK WITH ANY CO

     U S West filed its network disclosure statement with the FCC
in November and will begin an 8-month internal technical trial of
the service in Fremont County, Wyo., (county pop: 16,800)
beginning in May 1990.  The new E9-1-1 is scheduled for
deployment by U S West in its area during first-quarter 1991.
     "Inside our region, we will be marketing the system as a
turnkey solution," said Ken White, manager for public safety
product development for U S West Communications.  "Outside our
area, due to the MFJ, all U S West will be selling is the
software package, and we're still in the process of developing
co-marketing arrangements with systems integrators.  U S West
developed the software specifically for Stratus, and Mitel was
the only CO switch manufacturer that could give us an interface
to manipulate the service.
     "The transport costs between a small community and a CO can
be expensive.  Our new platform application puts service closer
to the community and reduces those transport charges.  Our
platform has been designed, but we are still in additional
development stages.  Once our optional interface is complete--
which should be around the end of the year or 1st quarter of
1991--we will be able to use the service in any CO.  Then we will
begin active and aggressive marketing.  The type of existing CO
will be inconsequential to deploying the service because of this
interface.  That's why this announcement is significant.
     "U S West has tested the service in our lab for the last 8
months, and it has past all feature and functionality tests with
flying colors," added White.  "But the medium must exist for the
system to correct itself and be remotely monitored.  In small
communities, COs are not monitored 24 hours a day, but liability
on 9-1-1 systems dictate that the system's heartbeat is monitored
full time, which will occur when the interface is deployed.
     "We've determined that there are 600 counties in our 14-
state area that are too small to afford current 9-1-1 technology
today.  That is the market that we are targeting."  (U S West
Communications, 1600 Seventh Ave., Room 3213, Seattle, WA 98191,
206/346-9998.)

INDIANA BELL TRIALING HOME ENERGY  MANAGEMENT TELECOM TECHNOLOGY

     Indiana Bell is providing the telecom technology that is
allowing Indiana Michigan (I&M) Power to conduct a 12-month
energy test program in Muncie, Ind.  The trial, involving 154 I&M
customers, could help consumers to manage their electricity
consumption more efficiently and lower their electric bills.
During the trial, test customers will use a special thermostat--a
TranstexT "Smart" unit developed by Johnson Controls--to measure
and adjust the amount of electricity used.  Indiana Bell's
network will permit 2-way communication of electrical consumption
and billing information between I&M and the 154 homes.
     The TranstexT thermostat will allow users to automatically
adjust the temperature on their electric heating/cooling systems
and water heaters at certain hours of the day, when electric
rates are higher or lower.  Indiana Bell's telephone lines and a
communications set in the customer's home will automatically
route the energy management information from the thermostat to
the electric utility's computer system and vice versa.  The
communication system will not affect customer use of the
telephone because the computer cannot transmit energy management
data if the telephone is in use.
     "This project is just one of many applications that will
allow consumers to more efficiently manage their energy use,"
said Pat Moss, Indiana Bell business manager.  "The data
transmitted over our network will help I&M determine how to
reduce the amount of electricity used during peak hours, thereby
lessening its need for expansion, and, in the long run, helping
its customers save money."  (Indiana Bell, 220 North Meridian
St., Indianapolis, IN 46204, 317/265-2583.)

SIEMENS RELEASES WORLD TELEPHONE STATS

     According to recent statistics compiled by Siemens, there
are approximately 455 million telephones in the world today.  The
statistics, the result of inquiries made to telecom
administrations worldwide, showed that citizens of the United
States use the telephone more frequently than others--an average
of 1,800 times a year per person.  Canada was a close second with
1,451; Denmark with 861; and the Australians with 593.
     The United States also had more telephones, 127 million,
followed by Japan with more than 50 million, and the Soviet Union
with approximately 28 million.  The telephone directories of the
world added 22 million new entries, for a total of 454 million
numbers--an increase of 5% over the previous year.  In Indonesia,
there are 30,000 people for every pay phone, contrasting with
only 100 per pay phone in Switzerland.  The Swiss place the most
international calls, an average of 28 per person.  The Belgians
are next with 12 times per person a year, and the Dutch third
with nearly 11.
     In 1987, the United States invested over $26 billion in
telecommunications, followed by Yugoslavia, which invested $15
billion.  The People's Republic of China added nearly 1 million
new telephones in 1987--an average of one telephone for every 100
people.  Turkey increased its telephones by nearly 50%, but still
has only 7.9 telephones per 100 people.  (Siemens Public Switch-
ing Systems, 900 Broken Sound Parkway, Boca Raton, FL 33487,

BELL-HAUN'S SUCCESS AND FUTURE BASED ON SERVICING DAYLIGHTS OUT
OF CUSTOMERS

     Tom Bell, CEO of Bell-Haun, a Westerville, Ohio-based
interconnect, and his partner, Mike Haun, met back in the mid-
'70s when they were both working in a large banking environment.
"Mike and I started up Bell-Haun basically as a hobby," said
Bell.  "Mike is the engineering part of our team and I'm the
front man.  We sold one system, then another, and by 1977 it was
pretty apparent that I could make sales rather quickly.  We also
did all the installations and have been a service-oriented
business right from the start.  "Our sales were based on
referrals from satisfied customers and now, some 12 or 13 years
later, they still represent a major source of our new business,"
added Bell.  Every 13 weeks Bell-Haun sends out a newsletter to
its' customers on company and product news.  "We get a lot of
positive feedback from the newsletters.  It helps to set us
apart, and gives us an edge."  The newsletter is also sent out
with proposals and to Bell-Haun's suppliers and vendors.
     "Bell-Haun is a service business.  Phones are phones.  The
difference in equipment is a difficult thing for a consumer to
see.  To us, the phone is a means to an end.  We sell the best
equipment available, but if all of those manufacturers go out of
business, we would still be around--we would just go to the
second best and still provide our customers with the best service
available.  We work very hard with our existing customer base
because a satisfied customer is the best lead to a new customer.
It gives us the inside track.
     "We focus on little things," said Bell.  "All of our
technicians wear uniforms supplied by the company, and all of our
vehicles are fleet maintained.  We try to follow the same
philosophy as UPS or Fed Ex.  Our office is located in a high-
rent area of the city, so when we bring clients to the office for
a demonstration, they see a stable, professional atmosphere.
They know that Bell-Haun is committed to its business.  That's
what we stand for.  Overall we use the soft sell approach yet we
want our presence felt," Bell added.  Bell-Haun is a 5-Star
Ameritech Dealer and handles Iwatsu, Mitel, and Motorola, and is
also a Centrex and data agent for Ohio Bell.
     "In 1985 we became an agent for Ameritech Mobile
Communications, and have installed over 8,000 cellular phones.
For the past 2 years, we have been working on what we call
Project '90 which focuses on voice messaging.  We see that as a
major new growth area for the company."  Bell-Haun is a
distributor of Teleconnect and AVT voice processing equipment.
"We want to position ourselves in the Columbus business community
as the answer to a customer's communications requirements."
Bell-Haun's customer base is between 4,000 and 5,000 but Bell
said that number was somewhat inflated because it includes
cellular only users.
     "We have always maintained an attitude that we want to be
the best.  Being the biggest is second to quality.  The
interconnect business has changed a lot during the 1980s, and it
will continue to change.  The emphasis on quality will only
increase.  I don't spend time watching competition, but I want my
people to know our competitor's systems.  I believe that the
successful company has to service the daylights out of a customer
to keep them your customer."  (Bell-Haun Systems, 935 Eastwind
Drive, Westerville, OH 43081, 614/882-4040.)
