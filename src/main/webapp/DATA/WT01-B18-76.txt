<H4>If the president were diagnosed with cancer...</H4>



<P><DD>...Doctors and researchers would search for the latest information available on treatments that could save him.  Top experts would be summoned to the White House.  The president would be treated with the best and latest available.  He would be given the best opportunity to defeat that cancer, to survive, and to return to good health.

</P>



<P>For the rest of us it's chancy.  You may get the best available or you may not.  While teams of physicians and researchers would search the literature to make sure a president or a senator got the best there is, the same would not be done for you or for me.  Most of us assume that our doctor is up-to-date on the latest treatments.  However, the facts are that this assumption is as naive as it is comfortable.</P>



<P><STRONG>There is a very real chance that a potentially lifesaving treatment exists that your doctor does not know about.  You simply don't know unless you have the latest information on your illness.</STRONG></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Computers:  Pipeline to Better 

Treatment</H3>



<P>Not too many years ago, searching for medical developments required a major medical library, volumes of heavy directories, and weeks of time.</P>



<P><STRONG>Today it is possible to search thousands of medical journals in minutes, using online medical databases.</STRONG></P>



<P><STRONG>Through database searching, anyone can learn about the latest developments in treatment for any illness </STRONG>--and <STRONG>you may learn about it months before your doctor does.</STRONG>  It is hardly an exaggeration to say your life may be saved by finding the latest information.

<P>The information contained in these databases is <A HREF="selfhelp.html">not accessible</A> from the World Wide Web; they are subscription-only, government databases which are far from user-friendly.  However, the researchers at Schine On-Line Services have been trained to navigate these databases in search of this potentially life-saving information.  Don't leave a stone unturned; let the professionals at Schine On-Line Services help you find all your treatment options!

"Can Information Cure Cancer?"

</H3>



<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>by <A HREF="gstory.html">Gary Schine</A></H4>



<P>I was 38 years old when I learned I had a rare form of leukemia.  The cancer would kill me, my oncologist warned, because there simply was no cure.  He tried to persuade me to take comfort in the fact that it would probably progress slowly; but all I could think about were my two small kids who I'd be leaving behind, and my wife who would have to bring them up alone.</P>



<P>Today, over five years later, I am cancer free.  I expect to stay that way, and the oncologists familiar with my condition expect the same.  I owe my cure to my own efforts in researching and finding the latest information on treating my illness --a newly developed treatment that my doctor knew nothing about.</P>
