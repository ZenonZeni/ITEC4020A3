<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of <I>Regional
Economic Prospects</I>, containing detailed macroeconomic and industrial
forecasts to the year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK.  These
forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK
economy.</P>
<H2>Extra jobs in the north are part-time</H2>
<P>Over the last decade, the expansion of the service sector and decline of
manufacturing employment have been associated with strong growth of part-time
and female employment.  These trends have become more pronounced in the 1990s. 
Over 1991-95 all the regions saw an increase in part-time employment for both
males and females and a fall in full-time male employment.  Only regions with
the best overall employment performance such as East Anglia and the South West
saw an increase in full-time female employment.</P>
<P>However, in 1995, when UK employment rose quite rapidly (by about 1%) in
response to rapid GDP growth in 1994, employment trends were quite different
(see Chart 1).  All regions apart from Scotland and the North West saw an
increase in employment but most regions in the northern half of the country saw
no increase in full-time jobs.  A striking exception is the North region, which
has benefited from several high-profile inward investment decisions.  In
contrast, most regions in the southern half of the country saw full-time
employment increase.</P>

<H2>Regional convergence during the recession has helped to keep inflation low</H2>
<P>It is well known that since the early 1990s recession unemployment in all
regions has converged towards the national average, with the high unemployment
areas outside the south of England seeing marked relative improvement.  What is
less well known is that this has been associated with convergence in relative
earnings growth, with Greater London experiencing a sharp relative decline thus
reducing pressure on national inflation.  Chart 2 shows the convergence in wage
inflation rates relative to the experience of the 1985-90 period.  This is one
of the classic arguments for an active regional policy: that a more even
distribution of employment growth will improve the UK's inflation/unemployment
trade-off.  Ironically this has been achieved not by design but by the scale of
the recession in the south.  The forecast suggests a gradual reversal, with
stronger growth expected in the south.</P>

<H2>The short-term forecast: faster growth in the south and midlands</H2>
<P>In 1996, the three fastest-growing regions are all expected to be in the
south of England.  Growth in East Anglia is supported by a recovering
manufacturing sector, continuing strong performance in services and improving
performance in construction.  The South West is also forecast to see strong
growth reflecting good performance across all the main sectors.</P>
<P>Although the recent strength of London's manufacturing industry is not
expected to be sustained, growth in services and a strong performance in
construction maintain the high ranking of the region in terms of GDP growth. 
Increased employment in London's construction and financial &amp; business
services sectors underpins a forecast strong overall employment performance in
London.</P>
<P>The Rest of the South East is forecast to continue to underperform the
national average, despite a relative improvement in manufacturing, mainly
because of continued weakness expected in construction as the housing market is
slow to recover.</P>
<P>The East Midlands, Wales, the North and Northern Ireland are also forecast
to see above average growth.  The strongest manufacturing growth continues to be
in Wales, led by the (mainly consumer) electronics and vehicle components
industries that have been the focus of inward investment.  In Scotland,
reasonable manufacturing performance is combined with a weaker than average
performance in financial &amp; business services to leave overall GDP growth no
better than the national rate.  The West Midlands is forecast to see a temporary
deterioration in relative performance, mainly reflecting the region's very
strong performance in 1995 especially in manufacturing.</P>
<P>Economic growth is forecast to accelerate in all regions in 1997 with growth
quite broadly distributed, but only regions in the south are expected to see
rates above the national average.</P>
<H2>Long-term regional growth converges relative to past experience</H2>
<P>In the long term regions in the south of England  and the midlands and Wales
are forecast to see the fastest economic growth, but some regions show a marked
improvement relative to their long-term historical performance.  Wales and the
North stand out, reflecting the impact of inward investment on the
competitiveness of their manufacturing industries.</P>
<P>Following a period in which Scotland grew faster than the national average,
the economy appears to be reverting to its previous position as one of the
slower growing regional economies.  However, the gap between the Scottish and
the UK GDP growth is also forecast to be less than was the case historically,
supported by fast growth in the electronics industry in which it is specialised.</P>

<H2>Notes for Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the European Union in collaboration
with ERECO, the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,
industrial and regional forecasts available for the United Kingdom.  The
projections are based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral
Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM), and originally developed in the
University of Cambridge Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project'
set up in 1960 by Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in
Economics, and Alan Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately
5,000 endogenous variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other
coefficients.  The model is continually revised and improved to take account of
new data and advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>The current version of the model, MDM9, has been developed over the last two
years with industries defined according to the 1992 Standard Industrial
Classification; 49 industries are identified, and 19 of these are services.  The
current version of the model has incorporated the change to the 1990 price base,
the 1990 Input-Output Tables, the 1995 Blue Book, and the 1994 Regional
Accounts.  It covers the whole of UK industry with its 49 sectors and 12 regions
and is the leading energy-environment-economy model in the UK.</P>
<P><I>Regional Economic Prospects</I> is published twice a year.</P>
<P>The cut-off date for the information used in the report was 16 June 1996.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies and government
departments by subscription to the company's UK regional service at &#163;4,950
per annum, although copies may be purchased individually at &#163;1,750.</P>
<P>Volume 1: xviii+208 pages, with 140 tables, 113 charts and 6 Figures</P>
<P>Volume 2: 176 pages with 113 tables</P>
