<h3><font color="#800040"><u>General Guidelines</u></font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">Since 1994, Ethiolist Services has been an open communication medium for 
Ethiopians, friends of Ethiopia and interested subscribers. Since its inception, 
Ethiolist has been a vanguard proponent of OPEN communication. This tradition, 
which brings us all together WILL continue to be a celebrated privilege we all 
cherish. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our aim is to provide forums(s) that would be used for constructive, informational 
and educational purposes. Our main focus has been and continues to be to bring all 
Ethiopians and friends of Ethiopia together. For the most part, we have been 
successful! Our achievements would not have occurred without your participation. 
We are very thankful for your support. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">As you all know, the Ethiolist file and list server runs on a commercial service 
provider's platform. Ethiolist is not simply one list but it is rather a huge system 
capable of handling transactions of multiple lists and file services. Ethiolist operates 
based on its contractual obligations and its guidelines. Furthermore, the very nature 
of the INTERNET dictates the type of service we provide. </font></p>

We put in every effort to ensure that mails are distributed to all subscribers. 
Because of the routing mechanisms of e-mail distributions and the involved 
nodes in the path of the transmission of E-mails, we are unable to guarantee 
all distributions. </font></li>

<li><font color="#000000">promotes an open communication medium and free exchange of ideas. 
Therefore, Ethiolist cannot monitor where each e-mail has been forwarded. 
Our guidelines state that it is up to the individual to express a &quot;Copy Right&quot; 
disclaimer on the write-ups before the first distribution has been made. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">As we mentioned earlier, Ethiolist is an open forum, however, we reserver the right

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=4>Other forums may be created in the future when and if the need 
arises. These available forums are experimental and may not cover 
all of the interests of subscribers. It may also be difficult to 
categorize a given write-up - meaning what some consider to be 
historical may also be political in nature. In cases like that 
subscribers are requested to make a reasonable judgement. 
Regardless of the difficulties though, we feel that we must start 
from a point and prepare ourselves to modify the guidelines as the 
needs come. </font></font></p>
