<p align="center"><b>License Suspension In Drug Cases Upheld By
Ohio Supreme Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp; Ohio's
highest court upheld legislation that imposes a mandatory license
suspension against individuals convicted of drug crimes,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a unanimous opinion, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that the
penalty did not violate the due process or equal protection
amendments of the Ohio or United States constitutions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Francis Sweeney
declared: &quot;All drug offenders are treated equally under
these statutes.&nbsp; The laws simply impose a penalty on persons
who have been convicted of a drug crime.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... These laws serve to punish drug offenders, to deter the
future use of drugs, and to protect the health and welfare of
society.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The opinion upheld the 2nd District Ohio Court of Appeals in 33
cases which were consolidated after a lower court refused to
suspend licenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Laws passed by virtue of police power will be upheld if
they bear a real and substantial relation to the objective sought
to be obtained, namely the health, safety, morals or general
welfare of the public, and are not arbitrary, discriminatory,
capricious or unreasonable,&quot; the court summarized. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court did not address the question of whether the suspension
constituted &quot;double jeopardy&quot; because it was a second
punishment for a single criminal action.&nbsp; Earlier this year,
the Iowa Supreme Court struck down similar license suspension
legislation because it found &quot;no direct connection between
the possession of controlled substances, driving, and public
safety.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the court ruled that, &quot;The
amended statute authorizing ... license revocation was aimed essentially
at enhancing punishment for controlled substance
possession.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>American Farm Bureau Pens Article In Support
Of Hemp</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b> Calling
it &quot;one of the most promising crops in half a century,&quot;
a recent issue of Farm Bureau News sings the praises of the hemp
plant.&nbsp; The publication is the weekly newspaper of the
American Farm Bureau Federation -- the largest farming organization
in the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Written by Debora Hood, the article declares that,
&quot;Legislation is needed to establish a recognized research
area for [hemp,] according to local, state and federal
regulations.&quot;&nbsp; It explores the potential economic
viability domestic hemp cultivation holds for the American
farmers and criticizes the Drug Enforcement Administration's role
in killing a Colorado bill that would have allowed the state to
grow test plots for research purposes.&nbsp; The essay also
recounts hemp's long and prosperous history as an agricultural
commodity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also included is an editorial by Bob Winter, president of the
Weld County Farm Bureau in Colorado.&nbsp; Winter worked closely
with hemp activists earlier this year and offered five acres of
his land for the proposed state test plot.&nbsp; &quot;Industrial
hemp provides a window of opportunity for U.S. agricultural
producers to take advantage of a highly profitable fiber crop
[with] many uses ...,&quot; he writes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;International trade agreements (e.g., GATT and NAFTA)
recognize the designation of 0.3 percent ... THC as the
distinction between industrial hemp and marijuana.&nbsp; [Yet,]
current U.S. law[s] do not differentiate between hemp and
marijuana.&nbsp; Thanks to these laws, the United States lags behind
other world powers in hemp production and must import raw hemp
pulp for manufacture here.&nbsp; [In addition,] U.S. farmers are
prohibited from growing a highly profitable crop without government
subsidy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The American Farm Bureau Federation passed a resolution at its
annual convention in January calling for research into the
viability of economic potential of industrial hemp production in
the United States. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Congressman Signs On To Federal
Medical Marijuana Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; A
bill currently in Congress that would amend the federal law to
allow a physician to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for seriously ill patients has gained another co-sponsor, Rep.
Julian Dixon (D-Calif.).&nbsp; Unfortunately, proponents recently
lost the backing of Rep. Louise Slaughter who withdrew her
support for the measure on June 18.&nbsp; The total number of
co-sponsors remains seventeen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Presently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by a
number of scientific and medical associations including the
American Public Health Association, the Federation of American Scientists,
the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services and
Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Nurses
Society on Addiction. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Religious Organization Endorses California
Medical Marijuana Proposal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California-Pacific Annual Conference of United Methodists
endorsed a California initiative that will allow patients to use
marijuana as a medicine without fear of prosecution from state
law enforcement.&nbsp; The group's resolution 104 supports the rights
of patients to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent and
specifically endorses the California Medical Marijuana
Initiative. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The United Methodists' organization represents 400 churches in
California, Hawaii, and some sections of the Pacific Rim.&nbsp;
Over 113,000 people are represented by the group.&nbsp;
Resolution 104 passed a legislative committee by a 74-1 vote and
was given unanimous approval by the 1,500 delegates assembled for
the conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This initiative is about compassion ...,&quot; said
initiative proponent and Registered Nurse, Anna Boyce.&nbsp;
&quot;[This] newest endorsement from the faith community [is] 100
percent consistent with our cause.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 initiative has been endorsed by the cities of San
Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa Cruz and Marin
Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses Association; the Los
Angeles AIDS Commission; the California Multiple Sclerosis
Society; the Orange County Register, and many other health and
community leaders and organizations. <br>
