The strength of small church communities "comes from a concerted

The strength of small church communities "comes from a concerted
effort to delve more deeply into Christian life on a more personal
level, while at the same time remaining intimately linked to the
church's universal mission," according to a statement just
published by the U.S. bishops' Committee on Hispanic Affairs. While
the statement focuses on small church communities among Hispanic
Catholics, much that it says should prove useful to other small
groups too.
   Titled "Communion and Mission: A Guide on Small Church
Communities for Bishops and Pastoral Agents," the statement's
publication was approved by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops' Administrative Committee. One noteworthy feature of the
statement is a special section of questions to aid small groups in
a process of self-evaluation.
   Small church communities are not a new thing, the statement
says. They have existed for many years in the United States, "but
in different forms and at times separated from the parish
community." This separation may have occurred "because there has
been little ecclesial information developed in the United States
as to how to foster them, respond to their presence or work with
them in our parish communities." However, this situation appears
to be changing, the statement suggests.
   What is significant about the small size of these communities,
the statement says, is that it allows the "members to relate on a
personal level and help to develop interconnectedness and
belonging. The smallness of the group encourages concentration of
church life and mission, not separation from the larger church
community."
   The statement explains that small groups "are not simply
associations for intimate self-disclosure and emotional support"
of the members. Rather, it says, the groups "promote their members'
growth through the experiences and processes in which they discover
and accept their God-given vocation."
   The new statement "seeks to shed light on the potential that
small church communities can have in efforts to promote the new
evangelization, particularly in meeting the challenge of making
evangelization new in its ardor, methodology and expression," it
says. In today's small church groups it can be seen that "a new
ecclesial reality is emerging ... through which we can see the
creative grace of God at work," the statement notes. It calls these
groups "a source of great hope for the whole church."
   For Hispanics, small church groups are a place in which
"religious and cultural identity is affirmed," says the statement.
Moreover, "the strong sense of family which Hispanics retain in
their daily living is strengthened" in these groups.
   "When solidly rooted in Scripture, church tradition and Hispanic
religiosity, small church communities constitute a new moment in
the church's self-understanding, epitomizing the celebration and
proclamation of the church," the statement comments. It says
"Hispanics look to these communities for a credible experience of
evangelization, where the Gospel is preached and truly lived in
daily life."
   One apparent objective of the new statement is to link today's
small church communities with the larger church on the parish and
diocesan level, as well as to interrelate what is new about these
communities with church tradition. Here are four examples of this
theme's development in the statement:
   1. "Small church communities fortify a centuries-old tradition
of faith. Affirmed and strengthened in their identity as Catholics,
Hispanics can better serve the larger community. Yet, while small
communities serve to preserve a vibrant faith, they are not simply
warehouses of religious and cultural traditions. They are truly the
expression of an emerging spirituality."
   2. "The sharing of faith stories reinforces the experience that
Christian life is communitarian. Reading and meditating upon the
sacred Scriptures in community helps us to understand the meaning
of Scripture with the mind of the church, thus avoiding
individualistic and erroneous interpretations. This leads to a
renewed link with the Christian tradition and a deeper
understanding of the church as 'koinonia."'
   3. "Small ecclesial communities can avoid the trap of being
self-serving through a grounding in their mission and through
interconnection with other levels of church. The communitarian
aspect strongly emphasizes this unity as an essential element of
being church. This unity forms a bridge with other communities,
allowing the mission of God to flourish."
   4. "Small church communities must not be seen in isolation. They
are not another church, but part of the one church. Their major
contribution is the new expression of Christian life. They offer
the church a new inner life. Small communities are not a new
movement in the church. Nor are they simply neighborhood subgroups
of the parish structure. They are the church itself. They are a
smaller expression of the universal church. As such, the church is
developing new structures to allow this inner life to flourish. As
communities of faith and mission, they give witness to a renewal
of the church's inner life."
   The statement stresses the need for small church communities to
be in solidarity with the poor. "This helps the community endure
and retain sight of its ultimate goal of communion and mission. A
community matures by being missionary; otherwise it becomes
self-serving and self-destructive," it says.
   The statement includes 75 questions for small church groups to
use in their own self-evaluation. The questions relate to the
groups' composition, communitarian life, ecclesial role, liturgical
life, missionary thrust and ministerial role. For example it is
asked: "How does the group help its members discover a common
purpose in applying Gospel values to all aspects of their
lives? ... How is the small community linked with the parish
community? ... Does the community participate in the sacramental
preparation of its members: baptism, first communion, marriage? ...
How often does the community go on retreat?"
   Among other self-evaluation questions, the statement asks: "How
do members get to know the needs of the persons in the community
and in the larger parish community? ... How are the members helped
to articulate their personal faith journey and their call to
participate in the mission of Christ to build the reign of God? ...
How do the members help each other understand the group's role in
the mission of Christ? ...
   "How is the Bible used in the group's gatherings? ... Give
examples to show how the community is maturing as church.... How
does the community plan to give direction to its prophetic stance
as a countercultural community and servant to the reign of God? ...
How are the members trained to be ministers and leaders? In the
community, in the parish, in the diocese? What type of training is
being offered?"
   The statement acknowledges that the growing number of small
church communities in parishes indicates that parishes "are
providing pastoral leadership and fostering credible structures."
But the statement has a cautionary note for parishes that are not
fostering small groups among Hispanics. It says:
   "Other parishes could also benefit greatly from the presence of
small church communities. Without parish support and proper
leadership, small groups could arise but lose direction.
Furthermore, fundamentalist groups could easily move in to fill a
vacuum." The statement says that "while many Latinos have not yet
found a home in our society, they have generally found one in the
church, especially in small church communities....
   "Many Hispanic Catholics are more comfortable with small
communities where people know one another and can interact with
their priests and ministers on a personal level." (The statement
is available in English and Spanish from the U.S. Catholic
Conference Office of Publishing Affairs, 3211 Fourth St. N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20017.)

Hunger, starvation, malnutrition: For Lent of 1996, Pope John Paul

Hunger, starvation, malnutrition: For Lent of 1996, Pope John Paul
II urges the church's people "to take significant practical
steps ... to multiply the few loaves and fish at our disposal."
This, he says, "will be an authentic way of living this
providential period of Lent." Nearly 800 million people in the
world "suffer from hunger and malnutrition," the pope says in his
1996 Lenten message. He calls hunger "a great tragedy afflicting
humanity." Feeding those who are hungry requires sacrifices, the
pope stresses. "Certainly it will involve changing our exaggerated
consumerist behavior, combatting hedonism, resisting attitudes of
indifference and the tendency to disregard our personal
responsibilities." Thus, feeding the hungry calls "for a deep inner
conversion." ...
   ...Some people might object that "a grand and unachievable
utopia" is demanded to meet the world's need for food, the pope
observes. But, he says, "the social teaching and activity of the
church demonstrate the contrary: Where men and women turn to the
Gospel, this project of sharing and solidarity becomes a remarkable
reality." The pope insists: "The earth has the resources necessary
to feed all humanity. We need to learn to use them intelligently,
respecting the environment and the rhythms of nature, guaranteeing
fairness and justice in business dealings and ensuring a
distribution of wealth which takes into account the duty of
solidarity." ...
   ..."Patient and responsible training from childhood on" is what
leads to "authentic Christian solidarity," the Lenten message
stresses. That's how a sense of solidarity becomes "a fundamental
personal attitude which affects all our actions and areas of
responsibility." What society needs, the pope says, is "a general
process of consciousness-raising, ... a process capable of
involving society as a whole." ...
   ...Lent, the pope says, is "a journey of love which opens the
hearts of believers to our brothers and sisters, and draws them to
God." He writes, "Each day we encounter people who are hungry,
thirsty or sick, people who are outcasts or migrants." This "Lent
we are invited to pay greater heed to the suffering written on
their faces."

"The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a view

"The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a view
to the creation of smaller dioceses so as to enhance the pastoral
dimensions of ministry," said the participants in the Vatican's
recent international symposium for the 30th anniversary of Vatican
Council II's Decree on the Life and Ministry of Priests. In a
concluding message to the world's priests, the participants thanked
priests for their "devotion, seen in the manifold works of each day
in which you are involved, and in your fatigue." It thanked priests
for "the hours passed in the confessional, the time given to
meeting and listening to people, helping them to discover and live
out the plan of God in their lives." ...
   ...At one point the symposium's concluding message said, "We
have been aware ... of those priests who are alone, those tested
by illness, the elderly; priests who are persecuted because of
Christ and his church, or victims of war and violence; priests who
for whatever reason live with whatever difficulty in their service
of God and of the church." At another point the message expressed
"a very special sentiment of affection and solidarity ... to all
priests who find themselves in difficult moments of loneliness, of
tiredness and discouragement."
   Not only should the churches "speak out honestly and bravely
against the root causes" of the forced displacement of the world's
125 million refugees, they should also "develop the capacity to
recognize, give early warning and take preventive action where
situations are developing which may lead to" people's forced
displacement, said the participants in a recent ecumenical meeting
in Addis Ababa of the representatives of humanitarian agencies,
sponsored by the Lutheran World Federation, the World Council of
Churches and the Catholic Church's relief agency, Caritas
Internationalis. The meeting's focus was consistent with concerns
expressed in this area by the Vatican, which in 1992 issued a major
document titled "Refugees: A Challenge of Solidarity," promoting
understanding of how many refugees "are forcibly uprooted" from
their homes....
   ..."People are increasingly uprooted because of gross violations
of human rights, destructive and unsustainable development,
oppressive actions by governments and, above all, warfare," said
participants in the November 1995 Addis Ababa conference. They
said, "Churches must be analytical, self-critical and confident in
exposing and seeking to correct such root causes of forced
migration and displacement, and the sin and greed underlying those
causes on local and global levels." ...
   ...What actions are called for among the churches? The Addis
Ababa meeting proposed that churches "promote educational,
artistic, media and interactive communications programs" to help
"church members and society at large to transcend barriers of
ethnicity, race, nationality and religion, to value the dignity of
each human being, to affirm the blessings of diversity and to be
vigilant in overcoming the language and practices of hate."
Intensified programs of "pastoral care and support for the
uprooted" were encouraged, along with increased "ecumenical and
interreligious collaboration" in advocacy on behalf of refugees.

What has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as a

What has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as a
result of major archeological discoveries of the 20th century, in
particular the discovery of Ugaritic literature in 1929 and the
discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947-56, was spelled out in
the recent speech Jesuit Father Joseph Fitzmyer gave at St.
Patrick's College in Maynooth, Ireland. The professor emeritus of
biblical studies at The Catholic University of America has been a
member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission since 1984. "All these
new discoveries in this century ... give us, first of all, a more
accurate understanding of how the Bible came to be, telling us
about the historical context from which God's written word, as we
have it, actually emerged. Second, they enlighten us about the
meaning of many texts that can feed our own spiritual and religious
lives," he said. For the more we learn about the Bible and the
context from which it grew, the more we come into closer contact
with the roots of our religious tradition....
   ..."Third," Father Fitzmyer said, "we learn that God's word did
not drop from heaven, in King James English to boot, but that it
has come to us from a venerable Jewish and Christian heritage,
which we cannot ignore. That tradition puts restraints on how we
interpret God's written word." Fourth, he said, we learn "that the
proper interpretation of the Bible can only be given when the
tradition, which came into being from the Bible itself, is properly
respected. We have learned how the ancient Qumran community had
such a Jewish tradition of its own, in the light of which it
interpreted God's word and produced its own parabiblical
literature. From such a community we, as Christians, can learn that
we too must interpret our Scriptures in the light of the tradition
that has grown out of such a Jewish-Christian heritage."

Christian Arabs often are forgotten both by Muslims and Christians

Christian Arabs often are forgotten both by Muslims and Christians
of the West. But Christians in the Middle East have a crucial role
to play in bridging the gap between Muslims and the West, said
Jesuit Father Samir Khalil Samir, who teaches theology in Beirut
and Rome. Interviewed by Vatican Radio this month, he said mutual
ignorance has made it difficult for the West to understand the
Islamic world, and vice versa. Just as people in the West "know
very little about Islam, and the image most people have comes from
television," so Christianity is largely unknown among Middle East
Muslims, Samir said.

About 150 people peacefully occupied San Salvador's cathedral Jan.

About 150 people peacefully occupied San Salvador's cathedral Jan.
4, protesting a government plan known as Decree 471 in which some
15,000 state employees were laid off at the start of the new year.
The cathedral had been under accelerated reconstruction in
preparation for the pope's Feb. 8 visit. The Salvadoran bishops'
conference asked the protesters to leave the cathedral, saying that
"the church recognizes in its daily pastoral work that large
numbers live in dramatic conditions ... but the end does not
justify the means.... The legitimate claims of the people should
be resolved using the proper channels."

New Hampshire's House of Representatives defeated a bill to
legalize physician-assisted suicide in the state. The bill would
have allowed doctors to prescribe a lethal drug for terminally ill
patients who requested it. In full-page newspaper ads Dec. 31, the
Diocese of Manchester opposed the proposed legislation. "Kill the
pain, not the patient," said the ads. Oregon is the only U.S. state
with a law permitting assisted suicide, but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled the law unconstitutional.

Former French President Francois Mitterrand, who died of prostate

Former French President Francois Mitterrand, who died of prostate
cancer Jan. 8, once said he was born a Catholic and would perhaps
die one. But in life he was an agnostic. When Mitterrand was
president, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris called on him two
or three times a year, always staying to discuss questions of life
and death or what sense can be made of war and suffering, according
to a Catholic News Service report by Barry James, who said
Mitterrand was intrigued by the philosophical and religious issue
of life after death. James wrote that Mitterrand told Elie Wiesel,
a philosopher and Jewish Holocaust survivor, that he had drawn
apart from religion without denying God or forgetting the faith of
his childhood. "I doubt. I am in the desert. God is absent,"
Mitterrand told Wiesel in a joint book published last year. "But
I continue to believe in him and serve him."

The Irish Republican Army reiterated its opposition to turning in

The Irish Republican Army reiterated its opposition to turning in
its weapons as a precondition for talks on the future political
status of British-ruled Northern Ireland. The organization made its
statement a week before an international commission was scheduled
to release recommendations on the disarmament of guerrilla groups
in Northern Ireland. Controversy over decommissioning of weapons
has been the key issue preventing all-party peace talks on the
political future of Northern Ireland. The IRA also said that its
disarmament must be tied to the disarming of the mostly Protestant
paramilitary groups and individuals favoring continuation of
British rule.

U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Raymond Flynn faced a possible State

U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Raymond Flynn faced a possible State
Department reprimand for a letter he mailed to some 1,000 U.S.
Catholic leaders last spring which called the U.S. congressional
debate on poverty programs "mean-spirited." A State Department
investigator recommended that Flynn be reprimanded for "showing
signs of partisanship" and "poor judgment" in failing to follow
department clearance procedures before mailing the letter. Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, had complained to the secretary of state, saying: "It
appears that Ambassador Flynn is making the claim ... that one
political party is better suited than another to the Vatican's
teachings on poverty." Flynn accepted the charge of failing to
follow procedure, but disagreed with the accusation of
partisanship. "I said the debate was mean-spirited. There were both
Democrats and Republicans" voting to cut social spending and
foreign development aid.
