Dear Dale, <br>
<br>
I am in receipt of <a href="dale-01.html"> your letter</a> dated
September 4.&nbsp; I must say that I'm in a state of shock at the
low-level, sleazy and hateful response you've made to <a
href="olsen-02.html"> my letter</a> of August 17.&nbsp; It almost
sounds like you were reading someone else's letter, since it's
almost impossible to recognize your letter as a reply to anything
I wrote.&nbsp; I did not ask you to support the legalization of
marijuana.&nbsp; You have certainly earned my complete
contempt.&nbsp; With people like you in charge of drug policy,
it's no wonder that drug abuse is skyrocketing.&nbsp; I don't
know how people like you can sleep at night. <br>
<br>
You have a double tongue.&nbsp; You encourage sick people to seek
legal medical treatment, but you won't help Allen Helmers who is
seeking legal medical treatment.&nbsp; Allen's doctor is ready to
testify that he has a medical necessity to use marijuana, and
medical necessity is a recognized, valid legal defense to
criminal charges for possession of marijuana in Iowa.&nbsp; In
other words, it is legal for Allen to use marijuana. I've
attached a copy of the <a href="../HELMERS/olsen-01.html"> letter</a>
I wrote to the Black Hawk County District Court, along with the
decision of the Pottawattamie District Court.&nbsp; You are
obviously the one who has no respect for the law. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
<br>
<br>
