<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Advanced Lead-acid Battery Test Project<p>
Performing Organization: Sacramento Municipal Utility District</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Mike Wirsch (916) 732­6754</P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium has been field
testing advanced lead acid batteries in its fleet of electric vehicles for two years.
Field testing prototype or production batteries in vehicles is the real proving ground
for energy storage technology and is key to development of advanced battery
systems.</P>

<P>Electrosource Horizon Batteries have been chosen for this test to validate: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI> 27% higher specific gravity ­ 45 win/kg 
<LI> 3.5 times specific power ­ 300w/kg at 80% depth of discharge 
<LI> 2.5 times longer cycle life ­ 400+ cycles 
<LI> short recharge time 
<LI> sealed maintenance­free battery 
<LI> expected low cost of production battery</UL></P>

<P>Electrosource's first Horizon Battery (Model #12N95) has been installed in six vehicles operating in the fleet at SMUD and McClellan AFB: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>1 Solectria Force 
<LI>2 composite pickup trucks 
<LI>1 composite sports car 
<LI>2 G­Vans</UL></P>

<P><B>Results of the project have been: </B></P><UL>

<P><LI> Success stemming from proper integration of all the components of a successful
battery system, including charger and charge management system </P>

<P><LI> Monitoring charge and discharge of each module by a cell­related battery management system has allowed us to accurately observe the dynamics of a battery
pack in the field. </P>

<P><li> Testing on a closed loop test track has validated the range and efficiency of the battery pack. </P>

<P><li> Efficiency of the battery system has been 15% better than with previous battery systems. </P>

<P><li> Improvement in calendar life and consistency of the Electrosource Horizon battery has been observed over its first two years of production.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P>

<P>Batteries were purchased for vehicles ­ six installations have been completed to date.</P> 

<P>Charging equipment was modified to accommodate the Badicheq Battery Management System which serves to manage the charge, equalize the batteries, and collect historic data on all discharge and charge cycles.  Laboratory testing was performed at the University of California Davis on battery modules prior to their installation in vehicles, and in­situ capacity tests of the battery were performed to validate the module capacity. </P>

<P>Operational and lifecycle data has been recorded and reported quarterly and will be summarized in the final project report. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>This two­year effort, started in the forth quarter of 1994, will continue through mid
1996. The tracking of capacity and life of the batteries will continue as part of the
expanded battery management system evaluation project. </P>
