Description of Land-Use Zones<BR>
in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area



</B></CENTER><P><BR>

The government has established four land-use zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.  These four zones, together with provincial parks, form the basis for future land-use in the Temagami area.  The land-use zones reflect seven years of public consultation on appropriate land-use in the Temagami area, and are designed to ensure that the needs of all resource users -- both recreational and commercial -- can be accommodated, while ensuring that significant ecological and other natural resource values are protected and managed.<P>

This fact sheet describes the four land-use planning zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area, as well as the seven provincial parks in the area.  It also outlines the purpose, allowable activities and access for each zone.<P>


<B>1.	Protected Areas</B><P>

<I>Description</I><P>

Protected Areas are land-use zones that include important ecological features such as representative old-growth red and white pine sites; the headwaters of rivers flowing through Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park; significant wetlands; provincially significant ecological and geological features; and significant recreational areas.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

Protected Areas are designed to support the ecological integrity of the Temagami area's existing parks, and to recognize and protect areas that have natural heritage and remote recreation values.  Commercial activities such as timber harvesting and mining and aggregate extraction will not be allowed to take place in Protected Areas, and management plans will be developed to provide over-all direction and specific details on the use and management of each of the Protected Areas.<P>

<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction are not permitted in Protected Areas.  The allowable land-uses in these zones focus on low-intensity, non-consumptive recreation and tourism -- to provide opportunities for activities such as fishing, hunting, trapping, snowmobiling, canoeing, hiking and cross-country skiing -- and on the protection of significant ecological values.  Prescribed fire will be considered as a method for managing habitat and maintaining natural ecosystems.
 Protected Areas will not generally be accessible by motorized vehicles, although crossings may be allowed.  Aircraft landings and snowmobile access will generally be permitted, but new commercial land-use permits or cottages will not be allowed.<P><BR>


<B>2.	Special Management Areas</B><P>


<I>Description</I><P>

Special Management Areas are land-use zones that have value for resource extraction, as well as existing and potential tourism and recreation opportunities.  Controlling access to these zones will ensure that these values are protected and managed appropriately.<P>


<I>Purpose</I><P>

Special Management Areas will be subject to carefully planned access, to accommodate a variety of land-uses, and to reduce the potential for resource user conflicts.  These zones will provide the public with access to remote hunting, fishing and tourism opportunities, such as remote, "back-country" hiking or canoeing.  In addition, the zones will allow companies to undertake resource extraction and other commercial activities, under carefully planned conditions of access.<P>

Special Management Areas will protect existing tourism infrastructure, while also providing new economic development opportunities -- such as the creation of new trails for snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and hikers, packaged fly-in "eco-tours," and other forms of low-impact, "back-country" recreation.<P>

Special Management Areas will also enable resource managers to identify and protect significant values that need to be managed by special prescriptions, such as the Lake Temagami Skyline Reserve, the North Lady Evelyn River headwaters, the Makobe River headwaters and the Montreal River wetlands.  Planned access to these zones will also facilitate the protection of self-sustaining fisheries and indigenous wildlife populations.<P>


<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Special Management Areas are designed to allow and encourage remote recreation and tourism opportunities.  Resource extraction and development will also be permitted in these zones, but will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  This will be accomplished through access controls and area-of-concern planning done as part of the Forest Management Planning process.
 Access to Special Management Areas will be carefully planned to provide users with a variety of remote and "back-country" recreational opportunities.  The public will have access to Special Management Areas by motorboat, canoe, trail (snowmobile, cross-country ski or hiking), aircraft, mountain bike, horse and ATV in existing locations, where resource features and values are not threatened.  Locations allowing the use of ATVs will be identified and designated as "Special Management Areas -- ATV Use."<P>

In some Special Management Areas -- such as the Lake Temagami Skyline Reserve and the Montreal River wetlands -- mineral exploration will be allowed, but commercial timber harvesting will not be permitted.  By contrast, in other zones -- such as the North Lady Evelyn River headwaters area -- commercial forestry will be permitted, subject to an approved management plan, but mining-related activities will not be allowed.  Special operating conditions will need to be developed for timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction operations in the Makobe River and the Anvil Lake-Willow Island Creek headwaters.<P>

Personal use permits for harvesting trees and using wood (e.g., fuel wood, dock-building material) will be considered in Special Management Areas, subject to the access planning for each area.  Mining-related activities in these zones will be controlled by existing provincial legislation, regulations and policy.<P><BR>


<B>3.	Integrated Management Areas</B><P>


<I>Description</I><P>

Integrated Management Areas are land-use zones in which resource management and development and recreational activities will be integrated, allowing commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction to take place alongside recreational uses.<P>

In Integrated Management Areas, resource extraction and development will be carefully managed, to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  While some access controls may apply in these zones, there will likely be moderate to frequent contact between resource users.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

Integrated Management Areas are designed to promote access to both tourism-related and resource extraction activities, while ensuring that these activities occur with a minimum of conflict between resource users.  These zones will allow a range of uses by a variety of resource users -- offering opportunities for both recreational and commercial activities, while facilitating the protection of significant ecological and other natural resource values.<P>

<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Integrated Management Areas will provide access to "front-country" tourism and recreation activities, such as bear management areas, main-base lodges, canoe routes, portages and trails.<P>

Where timber harvesting occurs in an Integrated Management Area, there will be a need for aesthetic management on important roads, along lake shores, trails and near tourism establishments.  Appropriate measures will be described in the forest management plans.  Mining-related activities in these zones will be controlled by existing legislation, regulations and policy.<P>

Access to Integrated Management Areas will be less restrictive than in Protected Areas and Special Management Areas.  There will be few, if any, restrictions on road use, but no new or unplanned motorized public access to lakes will be permitted.  All access to Integrated Management Areas will be planned, and specific road use strategies will be developed to minimize user conflicts and protect resource values in each zone.<P>

Integrated Management Areas are designed to accommodate a higher intensity of fish and wildlife use and management.  For example, most easy-access, "put-and-take" fisheries will be located in these zones.  However, fisheries management and habitat protection will be emphasized through controls and/or access restrictions and regulations.  Fire management agreements may also be negotiated in Integrated Management Areas.<P><BR>


<B>4.	Developed Areas</B><P>


<I>Description</I><P>

Developed Areas are land-use zones that contain mainly privately-owned land, including agricultural land, but also include some Crown land.  While some privately-owned and developed land exists in other zones, Developed Areas are zones in which most of the land is developed, and where the natural and/or human environments have been significantly modified.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

Developed Areas reflect the fact that land-use in some parts of the Temagami area -- particularly in and around towns and villages -- is subject to municipal control.  These zones recognize existing development, and will permit additional development to occur, while ensuring the protection of significant ecological and other values, and the sustainable management of natural resources on Crown land.<P>
<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Developed Areas can sustain a mix of development activities, including commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction, as well as "front-country" tourism and recreation facilities and related activities.  Where demand warrants, Developed Areas can also provide greater opportunities for utilizing Crown land for tourism-related activities, such as building new trail networks.<P>

Although mining-related hazards may exist in Developed Areas, provisions under the Mining Act ensure that rehabilitation takes place.  Resource extraction and development in Developed Areas will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  Mining-related activities will be controlled by existing legislation, regulations and policy. <P>

In general, local municipalities are responsible for planning appropriate land-uses on patent lands within Developed Areas.  Some municipalities, for example, have restrictions that apply to hunting and fishing activities, and/or access controls on municipally-owned land.<P>

Cultural heritage protection, conservation and natural heritage protection are municipal responsibilities on municipally-owned land.  As well, the Planning Act requires municipalities to have regard for a range of provincial interests when they undertake local planning, including significant Crown resources.  The Crown Forest Sustainability Act also provides authority to harvest Crown timber on private lands, and an interim policy provides direction on licensing, scaling, work permits and Crown charges.<P>

In Developed Areas, fire suppression will be the immediate response to the occurrence of fire, and fire management agreements will be negotiated with individual municipalities.  Prescribed fire may also be considered and used for specific resource management purposes.<P>

Rehabilitation of fish and wildlife habitat will occur in Developed Areas, and access to Crown land in these zones will be planned.  Road use strategies will be developed to minimize conflicts between resource users and to ensure the protection of significant resource values.<P><BR>

<B>5.	Provincial Parks</B><P>

<I>Description</I><P>

There are seven provincial parks within the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area -- one wilderness class park, four waterway class parks, and two recreation class parks:<P>

<I>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park</I> is a 72,400-hectare wilderness class park whose significant features include the highest known point of land in Ontario.<P>

<I>Obabika River Provincial Park</I> was created as a 17,000-hectare waterway class park containing a diverse range of water-based recreation settings, with extensive shoreline concentrations of old-growth red and white pine forests.  In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding a 3,520-hectare area to the park to protect the Obabika River North old-growth red and white pine forest, bringing the park's total area to 20,520 hectares.<P>

<I>Makobe-Grays Provincial Park</I> is a 1,427-hectare waterway class park encompassing the Makobe River at its point of departure from Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, north to the Town of Elk Lake.<P>

<I>Solace Provincial Park</I> is a 5,943-hectare waterway class park consisting of several small lake environments connected by small portages.<P>

<I>Sturgeon River Provincial Park</I> is a 3,350-hectare waterway class park consisting of a riverine system typical of many in the Canadian Shield.<P>

<I>Finlayson Point Provincial Park</I> is a 37-hectare recreation class park on the shore of Lake Temagami, one kilometre south of the Village of Temagami.<P>

<I>W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park</I> is a 465-hectare recreation class park site (currently undeveloped) on the south shore of Bay Lake, two kilometres south of the Town of Latchford.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

The goal of Ontario Parks is to provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, and to protect provincially significant natural, cultural and recreational environments in a system of parks.  This goal is supported by the four objectives of protection, heritage appreciation, recreation and tourism.<P>
<I> Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

The activities allowed in provincial parks are governed by the Provincial Parks Act, appropriate provincial park policies established by the Ministry of Natural Resources, and by existing and future management plans developed for each park.<P>
