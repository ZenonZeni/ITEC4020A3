Balancing The Deal

By Frederic Rubinstein, Kelley Drye & Warren, 
New York, NY; and Marc Morgenstern, 
Kahn Kleinman et al., Cleveland, OH
Business Law Today
November/December 1995, Pgs. 26-31

Overview:  Airs the unavoidable tension between the private placement issuer
and the investors it hopes to attract.  Highlights alternatives in structuring
private placements, which balance investors' risk/reward incentives and the
company's managerial concerns.

Choose financing vehicle.  The first issue a company must consider when
structuring a private placement is whether to sell debt or equity.  Proceeds
of an equity offering increase the company's net worth, thereby improving its
borrowing capacity and ov erall financial strength.  Although debt expands the
company's capital base, it does not increase the net worth and it must be
repaid.  Debt subordinated to the company's primary lending institution may be
viewed as equity by the lender (i.e., to satisfy the lender's
debt-to-equity-ratio requirements), but trade creditors may not share that
view.  While interest accruing on debt is booked as an expense, thereby
increasing liabilities and decreasing profit and net worth, accrued but unpaid
dividends on equity securities do not reduce income and have no impact on net
worth until paid.

Ascertain investors' goals.  To ensure liquidity for their investment,
investors in a private placement need an exit strategy.  As compensation for
the increased risk and longer holding periods of a private placement,
investors generally seek a high rate of return (an anticipated compounded
internal rate of 30 to 45 percent) as well as the ability to maximize their
probability of achieving a return of capital.  Therefore the investment is
often structured as preferred stock, convertible debt, or subordinated debt
with an equity feature.  To maintain control over their investment, private
placement investors often negotiate seats on or control of the company's board
of directors, limits on executive compensation, antidilution provisions, and
the ability to control certain transactions outside of the ordinary course of
business.

Consider the alternatives.  Before purchasing preferred stock, investors
should focus on the following negotiable features:  a liquidation preference;
a dividend preference, preferably cumulative; a conversion right into common
stock; a forced redemption feature; voting rights equal to the number of
common shares into which the preferred stock can convert; demand or piggyback
registration rights; a right of first refusal allowing pro rata participation
in any future offering; a "come-along" right to ensure the preferred investor
receives whatever the inside stockholders get for their shares; a "take-along"
that forces the inside shareholders to go along if the investor wants to sell
the entire company; and negative covenants restricting actions that diminish
the preferred stock's value without the investor's consent.

Compare rates of return.  The form of the security issued in a private
placement can have a dramatic effect on the investor's return, should the
company fall short of its stated performance goals or greatly exceed them.
For example, an investor purchasing $100,000 of common stock that represents
one-third of the company would receive $83,333 if the company were sold five
years later for $250,000 - a loss of $16,333.  On the other hand, an investor
purchasing 8 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock with a $100,000
liquidation preference, convertible into one-third of the company's common
stock, would receive $140,000 ($40,000 of accumulated dividends and the
$100,000 liquidation preference) if the company were sold five years later for
$250,000 - a gain of $40,000.

Going Public: Implications For The Question Of Minimizing 
Discrimination In The Residential Real Estate Industry

By Richard Bennett
Capcar Enterprises, Ltd., Bermuda
Real Estate Law Journal
Vol. 24, No. 2, Pgs. 122-145

Overview:  Describes several ways by which real estate developers can raise
equity.  Worries that the securities laws may not deter developers from
discriminating when making construction decisions.  Discouraging
discrimination.  If funding comes from a federally insured or funded
institution, such as a bank, developers cannot use it for discriminatory
purposes and the lender retains an interest in and control over the use of
funds.  Federal antidiscrimination laws do not, however, apply to funds raised
in the equity markets.  The shareholders, through the market, exercise control
by selling, which drives down the stock price.  Therefore, equity-funded
developers may feel pressured to focus on the bottom line and build only
higher-cost housing.  Although the SEC scrutinizes the financial disclosures
of a public company, it does not prohibit these discriminatory building
practices.

The MBS dilemma.  Real estate developers are increasingly accessing the
securities markets - through MBSs and REITs - rather than seeking traditional
bank loans to provide their working capital.  Mortgage-backed securities are
instruments that bundle mortgages together and create a security backed by the
cash flow from the mortgage payments.  A notable problem is the unevenness of
the cash flow.  Similar to bonds with a call feature, the underlying mortgages
may be (and often are) prepaid when interest rates fall, but investors cannot
ascertain the exact conditions that will prompt prepayment and cannot plan for
its occurrence.  Investors might value the MBS investment higher if they had
detailed disclosures about the underlying mortgages, including information
about the borrowers.  Unfortunately, the same information that would allow
them to calculate the probabilities of prepayment would also permit
discrimination against certain borrowers and certain neighborhoods.

With few strings attached.  Many developers use a real estate investment trust
to issue stock.  To qualify as a REIT, the trust cannot be closely held and
must attract at least 100 investors.  The REIT must derive its income from and
hold its assets only in defined areas, and it must pay a preset dividend.  A
typical REIT provides large amounts of cash to the developer, with few strings
attached.  The REIT's main advantage is that it is not subject to federal
income tax for the portion of its capital gains distributed to shareholders,
thus avoiding the double taxation of the corporate form.  The developer that
finances solely with debt runs a constant risk of financial difficulty; adding
REIT equity decreases the risk and may increase the developer's value.

Developers' decisionmaking.  Equity funding ideally would free a developer to
make decisions based purely on economics.  Theoretically the developer's ideal
portfolio contains a mixture of high, moderate, and low-income housing.
Affordable housing stock provides a steady stream of rental income, which will
look good on quarterly disclosure statements, ensures working capital, and
allows for the payment of regular dividends.  The fear is that developers
might not make decisions based purely on economic considerations, but rather
may shun low-income housing that does not increase profits for public
shareholders.  A statutory gap exists, one that allows developers to
discriminate when building residential housing.  The government should fill
this vacuum by extending the reach of the fair-housing laws to cover the gap
or adding new features to the securities laws.

How To Draft Financial Representations And Indemnity Provisions 
In Acquisition Agreements

By Leigh Walton
Bass Berry & Sims, Nashville, TN
ALI-ABA Course Materials Journal
Vol. 20, No. 2, Pgs. 39-48

Overview:  Outlines the representations of financial condition and the
indemnification clauses commonly used in acquisition agreements, including
draft model provisions prepared by an ABA committee.  Provides guidelines for
negotiating and drafting them.  Contrasts the arguments each side might use in
negotiations.  Basic representations.  The seller's representations about its
financial condition are critical elements in an acquisition agreement.
Representations are generally based on financial statements.  As early in the
process as possible, a buyer should review the audit report to see if the
seller's financial statements conform to GAAP.  Sellers are wise to represent
only that the financials "fairly present" the company's financial condition
"in accordance with GAAP" and not that they are "complete and correct."  A
seller's representation that interim financials conform to GAAP should include
proper qualifications, for example, that they are subject to "normal recurring
year-end adjustments."  In turn, the purchaser should require a further
representation that the effect of any qualifications will not "individually or
in the aggregate, be materially adverse."

Tailoring representations.  Sellers can resist or modify a buyer's requests
for additional financial representations.  A common request is a
representation that the target's records are complete, correct, and in
conformance with valid business practice.  The seller may respond that GAAP
financials alone are sufficient; however, if it does agree to give that
representation, it should add a materiality qualification.  Frequently buyers
request representations on specific line items in financial statements,
perhaps to avoid the seller's qualifications (such as materiality).  For
example, the buyer may seek assurance that the accounts receivable are
collectible.  The seller should object because doing so would constitute
giving a guarantee.  Other common line item representations involve inventory
and undisclosed liabilities.

Carving out indemnification.  Multiple sellers might agree on
joint-and-several liability, with or without an allocation agreement.
Alternatively, each seller's degree of liability could depend on its
proportionate share of the sale price, its role in the business (i.e., active
or passive), or the specific representation or covenant involved.  A seller
should indemnify beyond the representations' scope only on a known problem for
which a clean representation seems impossible.  Careful drafting can resolve
in advance any questions of whether tax benefits, insurance proceeds, and
found assets will offset losses.  Any clause setting an indemnification
deductible should indicate whether reaching it entitles the purchaser to every
dollar of loss or only every dollar over the deductible.  Parties should also
clarify how the clause intersects with materiality limitations in specific
representations.  A buyer should not consent to the seller's typical request
for an indemnification maximum equal to the purchase price unless it can carve
out appropriate exceptions (e.g., taxes and intentional conduct, such as
fraud).

Ancillary aspects of indemnity.  Sellers should not agree to indemnify against
breaches of representations and covenants from documents other than the
acquisition agreement and its schedules.  A buyer concerned about the seller's
creditworthiness could negotiate an escrow as a nonexclusive remedy, a letter
of credit, or a right of set-off against postclosing payments it owes the
seller.  An indemnification's time limit depends on the nature of the business
and the sufficiency of the financial statements provided, but the buyer should
demand at least enough time for one postclosing audit.  A seller should insist
that the indemnity is the exclusive means of asserting claims; in turn, the
buyer should demand that any exclusivity clause apply only to money damages.
Because this clause would not bar recourse under Rule 10b-5 (or other fraud
laws), a seller could counter the scienter element of a possible 10b-5 claim
by documenting the buyer's opportunity to perform due diligence.

An Argument For Invalidating Change Of Control Covenants

By Thomas Marko
University of Iowa College of Law
Journal of Corporation Law
Vol. 20, No. 3, Pgs. 475-496

Overview:  Analyzes change-of-control debt covenants, focusing on their
defensive use as a tactic to entrench current management.  Argues that these
covenants fail to satisfy the test for determining the validity of management
defensive tactics and therefore are illegal.

Protection or defense.  Courts traditionally refuse to recognize a fiduciary
relationship between management and bondholders and are generally unwilling to
find a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under
bond contracts.  Accordingly, bondholders often require bond instruments to
include a change-of-control covenant, which typically will give the bondholder
the right to put the bond back to the company or receive a higher interest
rate, should a designated takeover-related event occur.  The
change-of-con-trol covenant is usually triggered by a hostile attempt such as
a tender offer or successful proxy contest.  Because the triggers apply only
to transactions not approved by management and do not necessarily take into
account whether bond values will be adversely affected by the change of
control, these covenants are used most often by incumbent management as a
defensive entrenchment tool.

Unocal test applies.  The Delaware Supreme Court in Unocal Corp.  v.  Mesa
Petroleum Co.  established a two-pronged inquiry for determining the validity
of management defensive tactics:  1) the directors must have reasonable
grounds to believe that another entity's ownership would pose a danger to
corporate policy and effectiveness; and 2) the defensive measure is reasonable
in relation to the purported threat.  Although it has never been judicially
applied to determine the validity of change-of-control covenants in bond
instruments, the Unocal test seems the appropriate standard to apply.

Threatening corporate policy.  Delaware courts assessing management's
responses to hostile tender offers have recognized three potential threats to
corporate policy and effectiveness:  (i) opportunity loss (the tender offer
may deprive shareholders of the opportunity to select a better alternative);
(ii) structural coercion (the risk that fear of disparate treatment of
shareholders not accepting the tender offer may affect shareholders'
decisionmaking); and (iii) substantive coercion (the risk that shareholders
who disbelieve management's good-faith predictions about future value may be
led to accept the tender offer).  A change-of-control bond covenant triggered
by a hostile tender offer survives the first prong of the Unocal test.
However, only a proxy contest joined with a tender offer presents a legitimate
risk to shareholder interests.  Thus, a change-of-control bond covenant
triggered by a proxy contest alone would not survive the first Unocal prong.

Matching remedy to threat.  Even if a change-of-control covenant could survive
the first prong, the second prong requires that the covenant must be
reasonable in relation to the alleged threat.  By giving bondholders a put or
an increased interest rate, a change-of-control covenant benefits only the
bondholders and not the shareholders, who would be deprived of the opportunity
to choose between competing offers.  In proxy contests, dissidents would find
it much more difficult convincing shareholders to vote in their favor.  Thus,
a change-of-control bond covenant triggered by either a hostile tender offer
or a proxy contest fails the second prong of the Unocal test and should be
invalidated.

Dealing With State Securities Regulators

By Michael Missal, Stephen Topetzes, and Marc Bryant
Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, Washington, DC
Review of Securities & Commodities Regulation
Vol. 28, No. 20, Pgs. 203-213

Overview:  Explores recent trends in state securities law enforcement.
Explains the scope of state enforcement, focusing on actions against
securities professionals.  Contrasts state and federal powers and
investigative strategies, and suggests response tactics for targets.

State enforcement.  State securities regulators possess a wide panoply of
enforcement powers and remedies (including several not available to or used by
the SEC).  They often issue cease-and-desist orders in settling disputed
antifraud cases or other alleged registration infractions.  Most states permit
public (as well as discreet or secretive) investigation of securities
violations.  This public process can seriously injure a securities firm's
reputation, even absent any eventual finding of wrongdoing.  Because state
agencies have small staffs and frequent personnel turnover, they often resort
to processes that are informal, not fully documented, and not procedurally
safeguarded (compared with SEC investigations).

Collateral damage and coordinated enforcement.  State regulators often issue
stop orders revoking the effectiveness of registration statements they find
misleading or otherwise in violation of the registration or prospectus
requirements.  Given the cooperation between regulators in multiple states and
the nearly universal presence of "bad boy" provisions in blue sky laws,
sanctions in one state will generate sanctions in other states for a
multistate offering or one involving a regional or national securities firm.
Counsel for regulatory targets must therefore be sensitive to collateral
consequences when attempting to settle proceedings in the initial state and
are wise to maintain a more national viewpoint and strategy.

Strategize to prevent runaway liability.  When defending or settling state
enforcement actions, counsel should attempt as soon as possible to establish
cordial, cooperative relations with the regulators, who often serve
simultaneously as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and executioner.  During
the informal period, counsel should push to create ground rules for producing
documents and exchanging information, while keeping other states' regulators
at bay pending resolution of the initial action.  Losing in the "court of
public opinion" before succeeding with a legal defense can be a costly error.
The issuer should develop a broad-scale plan for making whatever corrective
action might be necessary in multiple states.  Because of the state agency's
high public profile, the regulators often demand that settlements include
restitution and administrative costs, fines, strengthening of internal
policies and procedures, further reporting, management changes, and other
supervisory requirements.

Current issues in state enforcement.  Many state securities administrators
have adopted a more aggressive posture in cases that combine a securities
firm's failure to disclose significant risks - notably of derivatives
investments - with allegations of its failure to make suitable recommendations
or to supervise.  State regulators demonstrate an increasing interest in
cooperative ventures with other states to attack regional or national
securities firms on matters at the cutting edge of securities liability,
without waiting for definitive SEC guidance.  In registration cases, the
states now often insist that issuers produce "stickered" prospectuses and add
special legends to sales literature to highlight, beyond SEC requirements, any
enhanced investment risks that the regulators perceive in the investment.

Regulation Of Canadian Capital Markets In The 1990s: The United States 
In The Driver's Seat

By Prof. Cally Jordan
McGill University Faculty of Law
Pacific Rim Law & Policy Journal
Vol. 4, No. 3, Pgs. 577-632

Overview:  Summarizes the Canadian system of securities regulation and
contrasts it with the US system.  Explores the development of US/Canadian
multijurisdictional regulation, and evaluates its impact on the Canadian
system.  Appends two detailed narratives summarizing Canada's regulatory
systems and enforcement provisions applicable to domestic and foreign issuers.

Subtle differences underlie.  Canadian securities regulation, constitutionally
relegated to provincial rather than federal control, resembles US federal
regulation, but it adds subtle adaptations and differs slightly in its
emphasis.  The legislation, especially in Ontario (the de facto
standard-setter), is drafted in a simpler, more modern style, while Canada's
regulatory structures have developed largely outside the formal statutory
provisions, on a more consensual, nearly ad hoc basis.  The extrastatutory
regulatory system in Ontario fell to a legal challenge in 1993, resulting in
the 1994 adoption of legislation authorizing SEC-type rulemaking.  A notable
contrast in the countries' emphasis appears in Canada's treatment of
registration exemptions:  unlike the subjective tests of investment intent
that SEC rules impose, Canada favors clear, bright-line rules.  For example,
no prospectus is required under the Ontario private placement rules for a
single purchase of securities worth over Cdn $150,000.

Multijurisdiction's disadvantages.  The 1991 implementation of the US/Canadian
Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) significantly impacted Canadian
securities regulation.  Under the MJDS, an issuer can rely on disclosure
documents filed in its home country to satisfy the other country's
requirements.  Canadians find the system more complex than they had hoped,
because the US did not ease its liability rules for the prospectus.  Thus, a
Canadian prospectus used in the US under the MJDS still looks very much like a
US prospectus.  The chief Canadian beneficiaries of the system so far have
been issuers of high-grade debt securities, whose primary disclosures consist
of third-party ratings.  The MJDS's greatest impact to date is seen in
Canada's harmonizing adoption of US practices such as shelf registration.

Ontario's aggressive recognition policy.  The Ontario Securities Commission
has forged new ground in applying MJDS principles on a unilateral basis.  In
its draft National Policy No.  53, the OSC has proposed permitting a
substantial foreign issuer of global offerings to use its domestic filings
from any country to comply with Ontario requirements.  The policy would have
permitted even exempt transactions such as Rule 144A offerings to use only
offering memoranda in Ontario, but under pressure the OSC has now retreated
from this policy extension.  The OSC also issued a ruling allowing limited use
of US and UK private offering memoranda in Ontario private offerings.  This
private placement ruling may pose a problem because of the common-law
mechanisms by which persons claim damages for misrepresentation, at least
until the Ontario legislature enacts a statutory remedy.

Editor's Note:  The full text as well as a summary analysis of the current
securities laws and regulations for Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec are
included in the International Securities Laws Handbook, a three-volume
publication available from Bowne.  Updated quarterly, the Handbook also

exchanges.  Call 800-370-8402 for ordering information.

The Duties And Liabilities Of Lead Managers In Syndicated Loans

By Gautam Bhattacharyya
Denton Hall, London, England
Company Lawyer
Vol. 16, No. 9, Pgs. 259-263

Overview:  Considers the common-law and statutory liabilities of loan
syndication managers in the UK.  Reviews recent cases on misleading
informational memoranda in the UK and elsewhere.  Addresses the use and
effectiveness of exculpatory clauses in underwriting agreements and
information memoranda.

Liability of syndication managers.  The lead lender in a syndicated commercial
loan usually undertakes the preparation of an informational memorandum to
solicit interest from other potential lenders.  This prospectus-like document
draws its content largely from the borrower, but by preparing it, the lead
manager can become liable for common-law negligence or deceit and, under
special statutory provisions in the UK, for any misrepresentations.  A person
ordinarily is liable only for negligent misrepresentations made to those in
contractual proximity; for example, in the UK, auditors are not liable to the
general public for misstatements in a company's financial statements.  Lead
managers, however, have the requisite proximity to the other members of the
loan syndication.  Their special relationship permits recovery for negligent
misrepresentations in the information memorandum on which the other members
relied.  Under the UK's Misrepresentations Act of 1967, a syndicate member
that made a loan based on an erroneous memorandum merely needs to allege a
misstatement; this shifts the burden of proof onto the lead manager, which
must then show the absence of negligence.

Harder cases:  deceit and fiduciary duty.  In contrast to proving common-law
negligence and statutory liability for contractual misrepresentations,
syndicate members would have a more difficult time proving a lead manager's
liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.  The plaintiff in a case of deceit
must show scienter or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
misstatement.  Despite occasional court dictum to the contrary, British and
other Commonwealth courts have declined to find a fiduciary relationship
between a lead manager and the syndicate members.  Courts tend to view
commercial banks in these transactions as sophisticated parties, acting at
arm's length, well able to protect themselves without the benefit of the
special relationships of trust imposed in the absence of particular
contractual clauses.

Exclusionary clauses to limit liabilities.  Lead managers commonly seek to
avoid negligence liability by disclaiming it in syndication agreements and in
the information memorandum itself.  Such clauses generally fail to protect
against liability for fraud.  Their effectiveness against liability for
negligence depends on their status under the Unfair Contract Terms Act of 1977
(the "UCTA").  The UCTA states that the disclaimer must be reasonable and the
affected party must receive advance notice of the liability disclaimer,
thereby raising doubt over the effectiveness of disclaimers that exist only in
the memorandum.

In a 1993 Australian Supreme Court case, NatWest Australia Bank Ltd.  v.
Tricontinental Corp.  Ltd., the court found such a clause ineffective where a
syndicate member had specifically inquired about certain borrower accounts and
had received specific assurances from the lead lender.  Other British cases
that refused to enforce liability disclaimers rest on the parties' unequal
bargaining power, suggesting that ordinary syndication situations will not run
afoul of the UCTA.  As an agent for the other lenders, the lead manager may
owe some duty of due care and skill when preparing the loan documentation, but
recent decisions have characterized the problem as "poor draftsmanship" and
too remote to permit recovery.

London Market Starts Up

By Derham O'Neill
Clifford Chance, London, England
National Law Journal
December 4, 1995, Pgs. C1-C4

Overview:  Describes the advent of a new, second-tier securities market in the
United Kingdom.  Compares its listing and reporting criteria to those of
earlier "unlisted" markets and the NASDAQ.  Analyzes the new market's
potential impact on issuers and investors.

Europe needs a NASDAQ.  Because other European efforts to emulate the success
of the US's floorless exchange - NASDAQ - have not succeeded.  the London
Stock Exchange is replacing its Unlisted Securities Market with the
Alternative Investment Market (AIM).  AIM is the first of several second-tier
markets planned for Europe; one in Paris and a Europe-wide market known as
EASDAQ are under development.  The objective of these markets is to create an
environment for newer, small-cap companies that offers regulatory and
disclosure standards adequate to reassure investors but not so complex or
expensive that issuers will forgo the benefits of public listing.  The
Exchange intends for AIM eventually to supplant not only the Unlisted
Securities Market but also the quasi-unregulated "Rule 4.2" market, although
currently the latter continues in existence.

Listing criteria favor new issues.  Since the AIM primarily wants to serve
newly public companies, its listing requirements do not cover trading history,
past public float, or minimum public share holdings.  This contrasts with the
major exchanges and even NASDAQ, whose "small-cap" listing requires $1 million
in publicly held shares.  To list on AIM, a company must have freely tradable
shares, publish financial statements in compliance with US, UK, or
International GAAP, and designate an exchange-approved "nominated advisor" and
a "nominated broker."  A nominated advisor verifies compliance with the entry
requirements, advises the issuer on the listing and reporting rules, and
confirms the issuer's internal due diligence program, but need not certify the
issuer's working capital.  A nominated broker (which must be an Exchange
member) is not a marketmaker but must use its best efforts to find trade
matches if no marketmaker exists.

Reporting and notification obligations.  AIM-listed companies must publish
prospectuses complying with the European Union's Public Offering Prospectus
Directive of 1989, but AIM does not review the prospectuses in advance of
publication.  AIM companies must disclose certain acquisitions and
related-party transactions, but at higher thresholds than regularly listed
companies must observe and without obtaining prior shareholder approval.
Because of the prevalence of newly public companies on AIM, directors and
employees must agree not to sell their shares for one year following admission
to listing.  The UK's new insider-trading regulations apply to AIM companies,
which must adopt codes of conduct that prohibit insider trading at least for
specified key periods during the year and must report transgressions to the
new exchange.

Prospects for success mixed.  The key investors in Europe remain institutions,
which historically have resisted illiquid investments.  It may turn out that
AIM's lack of capitalization threshold, compared to the relatively small
thresholds on more established markets, will raise resistance in these
investors.  AIM shows promise as a "nursery" for newly public companies, which
may later avail themselves of the LSE's upgrade privilege to list on the main
exchange after two years on AIM without having to issue new listing
particulars.  The development of additional second-tier markets in Europe
indicates that many securities professionals believe Europe is ready for a
NASDAQ-like opportunity for public trading of smaller and newer companies.

Joint Ventures And Opportunity Doctrine Problems

By Stephen Glover
Fried Frank et al., Washington, DC
Insights: Corporate & Securities Law Advisor
Vol. 9, No. 11, Pgs. 9-17

Overview:  Speculates on how joint ventures will test the opportunity
doctrine's limits.  Discusses the factors that courts consider when evaluating
the doctrine.  Suggests ways that joint venturers can tackle the problem when
establishing an enterprise.

Testing the limits.  The corporate opportunity doctrine, an element of the
duty of loyalty, protects an enterprise from self-dealing by its fiduciaries.
The increasing use of joint venturing between well-established companies will
test the parameters of the doctrine.  Directors, officers, and significant
shareholders (or the partners in a partnership) cannot divert business
opportunities to themselves that "belong" to the company.  This doctrine can
create problems for venturers when their own businesses are closely related to
that of the joint venture.  For example, a telecommunications company and a
software company might form a joint venture to develop products for
interactive television.  The telecom company might want to use the technology
created by the joint venture in the telecom field generally, but the corporate
opportunity doctrine seems to bar it from doing so.  A similar problem arises
if an officer of the telecom company who sits on the joint venture's board
learns of an opportunity that could be exploited by either the company or the
joint venture; that person faces a conflict of fiduciary duties.

The doctrine's parameters.  Several courts have articulated tests for the
doctrine.  Delaware calls its analysis the "line of business" test.
Fiduciaries cannot pursue opportunities that fall within the corporation's
line of business and that the corporation financially could develop.
Regardless of how they describe the doctrine, most courts consider six factors
in deciding whether a fiduciary may pursue an opportunity:  1) whether the
opportunity falls within the company's present or planned line of business; 2)
whether the company values the opportunity; 3) if corporate assets developed
the opportunity; 4) if the fiduciaries learned of the opportunity while acting
in their corporate capacities; 5) whether the company possesses the financial
wherewithal to exploit the opportunity; and 6) if the parties had any
agreement, express or tacit, on using such opportunities.  Cases applying the
factors tend to be fact-specific and provide only limited guidance for others.
Courts have, however, followed one clear rule:  Fiduciaries may pursue
something when they disclose the opportunity to the company and it expressly
allows the fiduciary to proceed, or if the corporation knew of the fiduciary's
activities and did not take steps to halt them.

Tackle the problem in advance.  Companies forming joint ventures should
address opportunity conflicts at the outset.  Carefully define the business
that the joint venture will address.  Consider including a precise description
of the venture's purpose in its corporate charter (this will render ultra
vires any activities outside the prescribed purpose and thus will settle
conflicts by requiring a charter amendment before the venture can proceed).
As a corollary, participants might enter into covenants not to compete with
the joint venture in its prescribed business.  Identify and allocate, in
advance, specific opportunities that might arise.  Determine in advance what
use each participant can make of technology developed by the joint venture,
perhaps through licensing and royalty arrangements.  Design a consent
procedure to be followed when opportunity problems arise.  Clarify how
fiduciaries of both parent and venture will disclose opportunities, and
exculpate them for disclosures made in accordance with the procedure.

Partnerships and LLCs.  Partners owe a duty of loyalty to one another.  Courts
consider factors similar to those considered for the corporate setting, but
they give particular weight to the partnership document itself.  Because
partnerships are contractual in nature, partners have more latitude to
establish the boundaries of their duties to one another than the corporate
setting allows.  The opportunity doctrine also applies to limited liability
companies.  Because this structure is relatively new, the parameters of the
doctrine's application to LLCs have not been defined and almost no case law
exists.  LLC venturers are well-advised to proceed under the assumption that
LLC members owe one another a duty of loyalty, similar to that in the
corporate and partnership settings.
