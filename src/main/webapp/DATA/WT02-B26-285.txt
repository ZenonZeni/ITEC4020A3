<A HREF="http://www.corpserv.nrc.ca/corpserv/sphere/h_7b_e.html">Gerhard Herzberg</A> was feeling a bit overwhelmed bent over the piles of
paper on his big desk. As Director of pure physics at Canada's
National Research Council, he was very busy in the Fall of 1959. Jack
Shoesmith his research technician had come into the sun filled office. He
walked up to the tall windows overlooking the Ottawa River and said,
"I have an interesting spectrum to show you."<P>

Herzberg thought of all the meetings and conferences he had to organize, 
the paper he was writing, presentations he was preparing and the
book he was trying to finish (the third volume of his series
"Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure"). He didn't have time
for this.<P>

"It's good," said Jack.<P>

Reluctantly, Herzberg got up from his chair and followed the young
technician down a flight of stairs to the lab below. It was a large
high dimly lit room smelling of ammonia, ozone and hot electric
wiring. They walked past the special spectrograph that Shoesmith had
built--a long steel tube about 50cm high and 3m long. Vacuum tubes and
wires snaked around the base of the aparatus, but the pumps and
electricity were turned off. The big room was quiet except for a
murmuring crowd that had gathered in the corner.<P>

Herzberg hurried over to see what they were looking at. A long thin
strip of glass lay on a viewing screen with a seemingly random pattern
of vertical lines blackening its surface--a spectrogram. Recognizing
it at once, Herzberg picked it up for a closer look. Instantly he
shouted, "That's it!" and broke out laughing. "Eighteen years," he
thought. "I've been looking for you for eighteen years."<P>

What Herzberg held that day was the first spectrogram of a simple
chemical called methylene--a molecule having a carbon with a hydrogen
on either side, written CH2. What was special about this? CH2 is a
very unstable compound, a "free radical", very reactive; a fleeting
transition species in many chemical reactions. But its spectrum was
the key to proving many theories of chemical structure. In addition,
by training their spectrographs on the stars scientists could use the
new spectrum to identify CH2 in nebulae and other interstellar
objects.<P>

That particular spectrum Herzberg was looking at in the
Fall of 1959 eventually resulted in a Nobel prize in 1972.<P>

<B>History</B>:<BR>
As a twelve year old in Hamburg, Herzberg and a friend named Alfred
schulz made a home-made telescope. They patiently ground the lenses,
and set them in hand-made mounts in a metal tube. On clear nights they
used to take the streetcar to the city park and set it up to look at
the moon and planets.<P>

Herzberg's mother was a vegetarian, and Herzberg has always been one himself.<P>

1. A spectrogram is created with a machine called a spectrograph. It works
by focusing a beam of light with a lens, then passing it through a prism
to break it into its component parts. The light source is created by burning
or photolysing a compound that you wish to investigate.<P>


2. A spectrogram is a plate made of glass coated with photographic
chemicals. When they are developed the plates have dark vertical lines.
By measuring the spacing and thickness of the lines and groups of lines
you can apply mathematical formulas and determine some of the energy
states of the molecules in the light source.<P>

3. The distance between the larger lines in the spectrum is proportional
to the molecule's "vibrational" energy. The small groups clustered around
the major lines represent the "rotational" energy of the molecule. These
lines and their mathematical relationships are called "Balmer" lines 
after the Swiss high-school teacher who figured them out in 1885.<P>

4. The molecule CH2 or Methylene. Methylene is a "free radical" which
means it has an extra pair of electrons that it tries to share with
another molecule.<P>


<B>Activity</B>:<P>
You need: a revolving chair or stool<P>

Sit in the revolving chair or stool. Now, holding your arms stretched
out at your sides, spin yourself around, or have someone else spin
you. As you spin, quickly bring your arms in. You should notice a
change in your rate of rotation. Is it faster or slower? This change
you feel is caused by the conservation of angular momentum,
a principle of physics that affects the rotational energy in a
molecule when electrons fall from higher orbital levels to lower ones.
