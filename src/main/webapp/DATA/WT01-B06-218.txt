  The <B>Free Trade Bill of Rights<A NAME=free> </A> </B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>(The Foundation has been accused of being protectionist. Over the last
sixty years the United States has built a framework of worker protection
laws, from minimum wages and maximum hours to occupational safety and health.
We want to protect these measures, and if by doing so we are protectionists,
then we wear that badge proudly. But we are not opposed to real free trade.
This article explains what we mean by free trade. We will have the Free Trade
Bill of Rights introduced in Congress as one of our legislative
initiatives.)</B>
<P>
<B>Free trade never existed. Free trade is a myth that fuels political debate
and drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (and fair)
trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules.</B>
<P>
<B>Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standard
for other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world's
leading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,
using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playing
field level.</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article One.</U> <I>Democracy</I>. The right of the people to vote
in elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.
[Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Two.</U> <I>Freedom of Speech and Assembly</I>. The right of
the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. This article
includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare products
in these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit certain
comparative ads.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Three.</U> <I>Prohibition of Child Labor.</I> Children under
the age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free from
coerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of 15
"employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil
and many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery and
chained to machines.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Four</U>. <I>Prohibition of Slave Labor.</I> No person shall
be forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,
however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.
[China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Five.</U> <I>Trade Unions Protected</I>. Free and unfettered
trade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All persons
shall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not be
retaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join or
to form a trade union.</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Six</U>. <I>Environmental Protection.</I> Emissions from factories
and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent
possible.</B>
<P>
<B>Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international standard,
but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards. [Pesticides,
such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported on Mexican
tomatoes.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Seven</U>. <I>Worker Safety and Health.</I> The safety and
health of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. The
occupational safety and health laws of the United States shall be the
international standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter
standards.</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Eight</U>. <I>Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours.</I> Factory
and agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event
less than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [This
means that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour
or more, giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workers
in Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and
cannot afford to buy the shoes that they produce.]</B>
<P>
<B>No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per week.
[The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while Germany
and France have even shorter work weeks.] </B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Nine</U>. <I>Barriers to Trade. </I>No nation shall discriminate
against imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.
[Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nations
have more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United States
causing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Ten.</U> <I>Illicit Trade Prohibited</I>. Nations shall not
trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being used
in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlaw
nation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and other
nations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, China
has been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. This
provision would allow the United States to punish China with trade
sanctions.]</B>
<P>
<B>When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questions
about slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works if
everyone plays by the same rules.</B>
