<H1 align=center>POLAR MUSEUMS DIRECTORY</H1> 

This directory provides brief details of museums known to have  
collections relating to the Arctic and Antarctic.  It is very much a work in 
progress and information about other museums, as well as corrections to
existing entries - heavens, forbid! - are welcomed.  The directory was compiled by
William Mills, Librarian and Information Officer at the Scott Polar Research
Institute, as part of a new reference work <a 
href="../people/wjm13/keyguide.htm">Keyguide 
to information sources on the polar and cold regions</a> (Mansell, 1997).  
However, so much information has now been gathered on so many subjects that
this museums directory has been spun off as a separate resource.<p>

Additional information can be sent to me at  
<a href=mailto:wjm13@cam.ac.uk>wjm13@cam.ac.uk</a>.<p> 

Those interested in historic sites associated with the exploration of Antarctic should
see the related site <a href="http://top.monad.net/~rstephenson/">
Low-Latitude Antarctic Gazetteer</a> maintained by Robert B. Stephenson.<p>

<li>collections and displays: Maintains a display of Antarctic artefacts 
open to the public attracting about 20000 visitors per year as part of its 
education program.  The materials are looked after by the 
librarian as a collection of national significance.  There are about 700 
catalogued items ranging from the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911-14) 
on, but the majority of artefacts relate to the activities of Australian 
National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) from 1947.  The majority of 
the collection is in storage since facilities are lacking to display 
everything.  Items are loaned to outsiders such as museums, hotels for 
Antarctic displays, and promotions.  For the ANARE Jubilee 1947-1997, the 
following pieces of equipment have been restored: Polaris Snotraveler, 
Weasels, Weasel sledges, and a barge caravan.
