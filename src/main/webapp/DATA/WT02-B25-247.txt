<P>



During Harris County's tenth annual Mental Illness Awareness Programs the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC) and the Harris County Alliances for the Mentally Ill (HCAMI) sponsored an all-day workshop:  "A Partnership Among Survivors of Mental Illness:  Veterans, Families, and Treatment Staff" on Saturday, October 15th. 



<P>



Sixty-four consumers, family members, and treatment staff attended with an even mix of the groups.  We heard each other's perspective, joined together as a united team, and began developing a vision for a brighter future.



<P>



The program consisted of: 1) an introduction to members of the treatment team--nurses, physicians' assistants, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers; 2) an introduction to nine self-help resources within our community; 3) four concurrent sessions on dual diagnosis, education and employment opportunities, housing, and questions about mental illness and psychiatric emergencies; and 4) two keynote speakers who shared their personal experiences from the consumer and family perspective.



<P>



The first keynote speaker, Bruce Stohr, was extremely powerful in describing painful experiences associated with hospitalizations, failed medications, traumatic efforts at employment, suicide attempts, and his struggle within the Marines. 



<P>



Yet with his family support, alcoholics anonymous sponsors, supported education, and Alliance for the Mentally Ill and consumer support groups he has maintained sobriety, found a medication that works, formed support groups for persons with dual diagnosis, become valedictorian for his college class, and received promotions within his employment with Harris County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Authority.  Bruce emphasized the critical need for hope and mutual support. 



<P>



The second speaker, Diane Ammons, inspired us with her perspective as the wife of a veteran who copes with schizophrenia and as the daughter of a woman who struggled with depression, hospitalizations, and suicide.



<P>



She brought to life the terrible stigma of mental illnesses, which often leads people to avoid talking about these physical illnesses, promotes isolation, and has encouraged professionals to blame families.  Diane encouraged every professional, family member, and consumer to join AMI, to take advantage of educational programs such as Journey of Hope, and to continuously include families and consumers as members of treatment teams.



<P>



At the Houston VAMC we are already working toward future workshops, a Journey of Hope course, and the formation of a VA Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  Our local "re-inventing" of the VAMC involves veterans and their families in planning and program presentations.  As AMI often states:  "Together we will make a difference."



<P>

<A NAME = "onbei"><H2>ON BEING A BOARD MEMBER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>



<P>



As a new member of the NAMI board taking office last July, I felt prepared for the responsibility due to my local, state, and State Presidents' Council experience.  I already knew some of the board and staff and had worked with them, which helped tremendously in my orientation to the board.  In my opinion, candidates for the NAMI board should have broad experience working at the local level and state AMI level.



<P>



I have found that reading is one of the primary skills used daily as a NAMI board member.  Weekly packets of information to read and respond to are mailed from the NAMI office.  I try to respond promptly to the material, read and share the news clippings sent in the packets with my local and state AMI president, and maintain a good filing system so I can retrieve material later as needed. 



<P>



Communications with the other board members and NAMI staff via fax and phone are an almost daily occurrence.  It is a great advantage if you can use a computer to do your own word processing or have someone who can help you with it.



<P>



The NAMI board is a working board, and while it is an honor to be able to serve our grassroots members on the board, the position is not an honorary one.  A "team spirit" attitude, flexibility, and willingness to work hard on assigned tasks are important. 



<P>



One can expect to serve on two or more committees, to be assigned as liaison to one or two councils and networks, and to serve as contact person for four or more states.  Board meetings require travel four times a year (counting the NAMI convention meeting), and it can require two or three work days to attend each meeting.



<P>



It is very important to be knowledgeable about how non-profit boards operate.  The bulk of the work is done by committees.  Running the business of NAMI is very much like running any other business, and having business experience can be helpful.  Fundraising is a board function, and--as a board member--you should be prepared to assist in this area.



<P>



Being a "single issue" board member can be frustrating to both the board member and the rest of the board.  The board sets priorities, and the list of issues and programs is long.  It is also important that board members understand that the only staff member that the board supervises is the executive director, who in turn supervises the rest of the staff.



<P>



My most memorable moment as a board member came in October during our board/staff retreat in which we shared our experience with mental illness as a family member or consumer.  Some of the more poignant stories came from staff; a reminder that they, too, have a personal dedication to our mission.



<P>



I have enjoyed my first six months as a NAMI board member, but I have worked hard.  If you think you would like to join us, please consider this description very carefully.  Then get on board.  We need good workers like you.

<A NAME = "namis"><H2>NAMI'S LITERATURE COMMITTEE</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>



<P>



<strong>Why does NAMI have a Literature Committee?</strong>



<P>



The founding members of NAMI adopted three goals:  support for its



members, education of members and the general public, and advocacy



for research and better services.  The Literature Committee



was NAMI's first committee, and it was formed to implement the goal



of education.  The task of the committee was to identify



high-quality, non-technical books about serious mental illness, its



treatment and needed services, and to recommend them to NAMI



members and the public.
