<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse</h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April, 1970, the Ford Foundation asked us to undertake a
broad survey of the drug-abuse problem in this country and to
report back by the end of the year on what activities private
foundations might usefully undertake in this field. During May to
December, 1970, we had the opportunity to review the drug-abuse
field, both through a study of the literature and through
extensive interviews. The report was completed by December 1,
1970, and submitted to several foundations for their
consideration. </p>

<p>We did not anticipate making any startling new discoveries in
this field, and, in fact, we have made none. We cannot say that
there is a magic solution to the problem of drug abuse. Rapid or
remarkable results in this area cannot be promised. Alleviation
of local and national drug-abuse problems will come, in our
judgment, through a slow and painful process of social change and
accommodation. Insofar as our report can help to establish the
mechanisms by which such change and accommodation may begin, and
even be accelerated, it will have more than served its intended
purpose. </p>

<p>The report is reproduced here without change. Although we have
added occasional footnotes to indicate significant developments
since December, 1970, we have concluded that any attempt to take
note of every factual change would be both futile and
unnecessary. Suffice it to say that developments during the past
year have only underscored the thrust of the original report. </p>

<p>Appendixes to the main report were developed largely by the
project staff both during 1970 and after the report itself was
completed and submitted to the foundations, in order to record
some of the more detailed information gathered in the course of
the survey. These staff papers may be considered current as of
about September, 1971. Although they do not always represent a
consensus of the project participants, they do make a useful
contribution to knowledge and discussion in the field. </p>

<p>It is not possible to name all of those to whom we are
indebted for assistance with the survey and the report. We spoke
to hundreds of people throughout the country, all of whom
generously provided time and material. The trustees, officers,
and staff of the Ford Foundation provided complete freedom for
this inquiry, together with ample financial support. We are
especially indebted to Mitchell Sviridoff and Thomas Wright for
their personal involvement. The Carnegie Corporation, the
Commonwealth Fund, and the Kaiser Foundation have been most
encouraging in their consideration of the report, as have
numerous other foundations and organizations. </p>

<p>We could not have undertaken the work involved in this survey
or completed the report without the strong support of James V.
DeLong, the only professional staff member who worked on the
project from beginning to end. His tenacity in ferreting out the
types of elusive facts on which any useful report must inevitably
rely, and his detailed and repeated review of the work product
have won him the respect of the entire drug-abuse field. We would
also like to give special thanks to Peter Wilson, who was with
the project during the first hectic period. </p>

<p>Substantial support in the form of time and resources was
freely donated by the Washington law firm of Covington &amp;
Burling. We also wish to thank the support staff-Meg Gleason,
Jacqueline Volpe, Angela Corley, Joan Henderson, Janine Yunker,
and Lilly Smith-for their skill and patience in finding and
keeping track of material and in preparing and revising endless
drafts. </p>

<p>Finally, we are gratified by the announcement that the Drug
Abuse Council proposed in the report has been established and is
beginning operations. We wish its new President, Thomas E.
Bryant, M.D., and the Chairman of its Board, Bethuel M. Webster,
success in bringing this new venture to fruition.<br>
