TESORO RE-ASSURES JOBBERS FOLLOWING BOARD OVERTHROW THREAT

Dissident shareholders may push Tesoro to sell refining
division, following move to oust entire board of directors.

Bid, led by Lafayette, La.-based Stone Energy Corp. chairman
James H. Stone, seeks to improve company value through increased
stock price.

To reach that goal, group would install handpicked board and
likely sell off Tesoro's refinery business to focus instead on
exploration and production, according to papers filed with
Securities & Exchange Commission Dec. 26.

Shareholder action comes on heels of company decision to pull
out of California market (OW 12/25).

Company shuts down terminals at Sacramento, Calif., (172,000
barrels) and Stockton (57,000 bbl.) by mid-January.

Meantime, Tesoro's branded push in Pacific Northwest (OW 7/3)
shouldn't be affected by legal swirl.

Several Tesoro jobbers in Oregon told Oil Week last week that
company has assured them Tesoro flags will continue to fly
regardless of shareholder suit outcome and shut-down of
California terminals.

"We're not concerned by news" after talking with marketing rep,
jobber said.

Other jobbers report sales have picked up since they rebranded
to Tesoro.

Portland-area jobber Johnson Oil rebranded Astoria station in
June and followed with Seaview and Knappa sites in Fall.

"The brand's working," jobber said.  Johnson will rebrand fourth
station in Manzanita when it gets signage approval from city
council.

Tesoro spokesman declined to comment on dissident shareholder
suit.

Stone spokesman also declined comment.  However, Stone Energy
issued statement last week saying move was part of Chairman
Stone's personal investment strategy and not a company action.

GREENS SLAM ELECTRIC CAR DELAY

California Air Resource Board staff report recommends axing 2%
electric car sales in 1998, delaying "zero-emission vehicle"
mandate until at least 2003.

CARB would vote on final plan in March following public
hearings.

Agency earlier told staff to come up with a new plan because E-
car technology is too primitive, expensive and consumer-
unfriendly (OW 11/27).

ZEV Environmental Alliance, a "green" group favoring electric
cars, fears latest CARB delay may be prelude to yet another E-
car delay when 2003 deadline for 10% ZEV sales approaches.

Massachusetts and New York may also delay any ZEV mandate
because they're following whatever California does.

Anti-ZEV group, Californians Against Hidden Taxes (CAHT),
praises CARB staff report for axing 1998 deadline.

But group says it's dismayed that CARB plan would eventually
mandate electric cars, since that would only result in a 1% air
quality improvement at a cost in excess of $20 billion.

CAHT spokesperson Anita Mangels says it's time for CARB to look
for other, more cost-effective measures to clean up the air.

CARB might "chicken out" on costly, consumer-unfriendly ZEV
mandate as 2003 approaches, but Mangels says consumers have no
assurance that.

Many observers feel CARB can't mandate ZEVs in 1998 because of
growing voter/consumer revolt against costly, impractical
government mandates and subsidies.

DEALERS ASK COURT TO STOP BELOW-COST

Below-cost sales fight in Southern Florida heats up, with a
jobber filing a below-cost selling lawsuit against an Amoco
branded retailer.

Jobber, Maximo Investments, is joined by Mobil dealer Jorgelina
Lago, M & H Citgo, and Sunshine Gasoline Distributors in suit
against ISJ Energy.

Suit, filed in circuit court in Dade County, also names Jay
David Weinstock as defendant.

Suit seeks damages in excess of $45,000 under state's Motor Fuel
Marketing Practices Act.

Sunshine owns and manages Miami Palm Plaza Mobil with Lago as a
contract operator.

Sunshine also provides management services for a Miami-area
Citgo station owned by Maximo.

M & H Citgo is a contract operator for Maximo's station.

ISJ owns an Amoco branded station nearby, managed by Weinstock.

Florida law prohibits below-cost sales where the effect injures
competition.  Retailers are, however, allowed to sell below
their cost in order to meet competition.

Suit alleges Amoco station has sold between 7-11 cents/gal.
below cost on all grades since November 1.

That's in a market where dealer laid-in cost was about
$1.059/gallon for regular unleaded and retailers were selling
for 99.9 cents/gal.

Suit seeks actual damages in excess of $15,000, plus attorney's
fees.  Suit also seeks injunctive relief.

ISJ signed consent decree with attorney general in 1992 for
below-cost selling at another Amoco branded outlet.

In light of alleged violation of consent decree, suit requests
court treble actual damages.

Retailers in Southern Florida complain Attorney General rarely
enforces below-cost law because it is unpopular politically.

So, jobbers and dealers are taking matters into their own hands
in the courts.

SUWANNEE SWIFTY EXITS ALA.

Florida-based C-store chain Suwannee Swifty completes exit from
Alabama with sale of four stores to Griffin, Ga.-based
PetroSouth.

PetroSouth, which operates about 135 units in Alabama and
Georgia, will rebrand the sites to Citgo or its own brand,
company says.

Sites will be rebranded first quarter 1996.

Buy is part of PetroSouth's goal to grow by at least 50
locations by end of 1996.

Company plans to move into in Florida early 1996.

Meantime, Suwannee Swifty's exit from Alabama is part of
company's plan to focus on core markets, company says.

Company raised eyebrows in Tallahassee, Fla. this month when it
closed three stores overnight.

One store still had help wanted sign in window, while another
had a happy holidays sign on reader board.

Suwannee Swifty says closures were planned.

Company says although it is consolidating now, it expects to
start growing in core markets early in 1996.

Company now operates about 200 stores in South Georgia and
Northern Florida.

ALTERNATE FUELS MAY GET VASTLY CHEAPER COMPETITOR

Engine/heavy equipment giant Caterpillar takes another big
stride in quest to prove its "A-21" naptha/water/surfactant
emulsion as a clean, cheap alternate fuel.

Fuel has made headlines since Caterpillar's announcement last
year of a scientific breakthrough with new fuel, invented by
scientist Rudolph Gunnerman of A-55/Advanced Fuels of Reno,
Nevada.

Fuel is an emulsion of about half water and half petroleum
naptha; large-volume production eventually would cost about 35
cents/gallon ex-tax at refinery gate.

Plus, fuel would get about same mileage as conventional diesel
or gasoline, according to company test results submitted to
Nevada Bureau of Air Quality.

Fuel would require no changes to oil industry distribution
structure and only minor, relatively cheap changes to engines.

Fuel also would save refiners from further costly upgrades to
refineries and eliminate costlier alternate-fuel competitors.

Few details about the fuel have emerged since initial
announcement.

However, Nevada just certified A-21 fuel for use as a clean
alternative fuel, with a ringing endorsement from Gov. Bob
Miller.

Now, Nevada State Energy Office says it's pushing for
demonstration of A-21-fueled power generator at a new alternate-
fuels facility, formerly the nuclear Nevada Test Site.

Still, Caterpillar has yet to register A-21 fuel with EPA or get
it certified by federal Dept. of Energy as an "alternate fuel"
that fleets could use to meet costly Energy Policy Act mandates.

But company officials met with DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary
recently, and a DOE policy office has begun to take a look at
the fuel, we've learned.

Meantime, several demonstration test projects are underway, some
involving stationary engines and some involving motor vehicles.

Test results submitted to state of Nevada for designating A-21
as an "alternate fuel" describe fuel as an emulsion of 52% water
(by weight) and 48% hydrocarbon plus 0.5% hydrocarbon surfactant
holding fuel in stable emulsion.

Fuel could be used in either spark or compression-ignition
engines.

Spokesman for Advanced Fuels, Caterpillar's joint-venture
partner in fuel, says water emulsion keeps engine temperature
down, allowing slower, more complete combustion and much lower
emissions.  Similar principle was used in World War II
airplanes.

A nickel catalyst installed in cylinder, possibly employing a
small nickel plate or a nickel spark plug, might promote
combustion of hydrogen molecules in water-fuel emulsion, or so
theorizes fuel's inventor.

In any case, water vapor is a major component of tailpipe gases,
even if water molecules actually provide little or no energy.

Test results submitted to Nevada Bureau of Air Quality show fuel
passes California's tough Phase 2 emission regs and EPA's tough
new regs for diesel engine emissions.

Assuming fuel passes federal regulatory hurdles, marketing would
initially target diesel fleets, then any fleets in areas
affected by "alternate fuels" mandates.

Fuel would require dedicated tank storage.  In extra-cold areas,
fuel may require some ethanol blending to prevent icing.

If demand grows enough, then shipping from naptha
refiner/blenders via pipeline to terminals would become more
feasible, an Advanced Fuels spokesman says.

TOP CHEMIST, JOBBER: CLEAN ENGINE BEATS ALTERNATE FUEL

Properly-tuned cars with properly-maintained oil and fuel
systems do far more to prevent air pollution than multi-billion-
dollar alternate fuels programs.

That's what University of Denver chemistry professor Don
Stedman, inventor of increasingly-popular "remote sensing
device" (RSD) pollution detector, has been telling EPA for years
(OW 1/2/95, 2/21/94).

But politicians have had more fun beating up on oil companies by
mandating costly alternate-fuel programs, rather than insisting
consumers keep their vehicle systems clean, Stedman says.

About 10% of cars on the road today cause most air pollution,
studies show.

So, detecting those "gross polluters" and then fixing them with
good maintenance would save U.S. consumers and taxpayers
billions of dollars wasted on alternate fuels and oxy-fuels.

California jobber Steve Kludt heartily agrees with Stedman.

That's why Kludt has been trying to get government agencies to
promote good maintenance over alternate fuels.

He's also prodded one local agency to test "Super Tune" oil and
fuel system cleansing additive, a mixture of common, well-known
chemical solvents that he's marketed to fleet accounts for
years.

Kludt agrees that well-tuned vehicles with good maintenance and
regular oil changes don't necessarily need an extra dose of
cleaning solvents to cut air pollution.

But some vehicles do need that extra shot of engine cleanser
from time to time.

Fleet vehicles can even extend oil change intervals, offsetting
cost of the solvent additives, he says.

Unlike goofy fuel-system magnets and other "secret formula"
snake-oils, Super Tune is nothing more than toluene, methyl-
ethyl-ketone, isopropyl alcohol and a lightweight mineral
carrying oil.

Those are well-known, common oil/chemical industry solvents,
Stedman confirms.

While Stedman personally doesn't recommend any sort of
additives, he concedes that perhaps 10% of vehicles may
occasionally need something extra, such as solvents, to remove
pollution-causing dirt from engines.

As Kludt explains, "you cannot properly tune an engine if it has
crankcase and fuel system deposits."

Cleaning those systems, properly tuning vehicle and changing oil
regularly will cut pollution dramatically.

Ironically, auto manufacturers now push 50,000 mile tuneups and
lengthy oil change intervals.  That not only causes pollution,
but could ruin engines.

Planned obsolescence could explain those automaker
recommendations, Kludt says.

Meantime, consumer revolt against costly alternate fuels
continues to grow, as evidenced by more states opting-out of
costly RFG programs and California beginning to back-off
electric-car and natural-gas-car mandates.

So now may be right time for oil industry to propose far-less-
costly alternatives, such as better emissions inspections, tune-
ups for dirty cars and proper oil/fuel system maintenance.

While many automotive aftermarket bottlers target dirty fuel
systems, "nobody thinks about crankcase deposits," Kludt says.

Those deposits can foul PCV valves, which in turn cause tailpipe
pollution.  Proper oil changes, plus a solvent treatment for
especially-dirty cars, could clean up crankcases that cause so
much pollution.

At only about $3.75 per bottle with regular oil changes,
solvents such as Super-Tune could fix pollution problems a lot
cheaper than $40,000 electric cars, $30,000 CNG cars or RFG
gasolines costing 10-25 cents/gal. more than ordinary gasoline,
Kludt maintains.

Kludt also says he hopes to get more jobbers interested in
promoting maintenance over alternate fuels.
