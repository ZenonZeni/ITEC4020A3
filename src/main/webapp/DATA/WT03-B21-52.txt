<a name="center"><h4>Education Center Opens May 4</h4>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of The Harden Foundation, Redwings now has a beautiful Education Center that will have its Grand Opening May 4, 1996!  We are looking forward to sharing this special place with all those who come to visit the Sanctuary.  It will be open to the public every Open Day, and available during the week for school group tours.  Among other things, the Center will have many resource materials, including a video library, a legislative table where visitors can learn the facts about pending bills, and stationery and envelopes for letter writing.  There will also be a video monitor with a library of educational/ informational tapes covering all aspects of horse care and equine related issues.</p>

<a name="protect"><h4> Protect Your Horse</h4>

<p><LI><A HREF="http://www.horseweb.com/client/kka"> Kyro Kinetics Home Page.</A></LI> Kyro Kinetics Freeze Marking Clinic will be held at Redwings Horse Sanctuary. Come join us for a day of speakers and freeze marking.* For more information, call Shelly at 408/624-0315. Reservations are needed if you want your horse freeze marked.</p>

<p><i>*A freeze mark is a permanent, unalterable series of symbols on an animal's neck applied with an "iron " that has been immersed in liquid nitrogen.  The procedure is painless and the symbols represent information pertaining only to that animal.</p></i>

<a name="wild"><h4>Wild Horses</h4>

<p>Mother and daughter were huddled inside the horse trailer.  Bonnie and Shelly of Redwings would not have known they were there had they not asked questions while waiting for the trailer to be unloaded, and upon viewing the freeze marks, pressed the owner for more information.  Three days previously, the owner had received title to them through the Bureau of Land Management's adoption program.  They were now going on the auction block destined for slaughter.  It is illegal for mustangs to be sold for commercial purposes according to the 1971 Act protecting wild horses and burros, yet many go to slaughter because the Bureau of Land Management does not enforce the law as originally written.  I have spoken to several BLM law enforcement agents and they concurred - it is illegal.  How can it be that animals considered a national treasure are ending up at the slaughterhouse?  This mare and filly will be considered treasures at Redwings and can look forward to a safe and loving home for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>All of us have been given the responsibility of protecting the mustangs and burros which live on the public lands. I urge you to speak up for those that have no voice in Congress.  Please write and demand that, at the very least, the Bureau of Land Management make prospective adopters aware that selling mustangs to slaughter is illegal.  We have been unable to find it mentioned anywhere in their literature.  Our legislators must not forget about them and it's up to all of us to remind them of their duty to enforce the laws protecting the mustangs and burros.  Wild Horse Annie must be turning over in her grave! !</p>


<p>Wild Burro Rescue of Washington will be in charge of another roundup this year of wild burros in Death Valley.  These burros would otherwise be shot by the National Park Service.  There will be approximately 30-40 burros that will need homes.  Please contact Diana and Gene Chantos at 360/985-7282 if you're interested in providing a good home for these special animals.  Someday soon there will no longer be any wild burros in Death Valley.  They are not wanted - 400 of them have been shot since the National Park Service began implementing its policy to eliminate the burros from  the area.  Redwings personnel will be hands on assisting with the wild burro rescue.</p>

<a name="net"><h4>We've Redefined Being on the Net - The Redwings Network Finds Homes for the Horses in Distress</h4>

<p>Thanks to those of you who have called in and contributed towards making our networking system such a success.  Recently, a Redwings supporter called to see if I could help find a home for a pony with founder* at a children's camp.  If not, the little mare would be sent to auction in two days.  That didn't give me much time, but I knew with the founder she'd be sold to slaughter.  I had to act fast.  Fortunately, there are people on my list looking for horses who are willing to consider animals with some physical limitations.  The family that offered to take the pony were willing to not only give her a permanent loving home, but also devote whatever time and money it would take to bring her back to health.  It is so wonderful to know people are able to open their hearts and homes to horses in distress.</p>

<p>Please call me if you want to give a horse, pony or donkey a permanent, loving home.</p>

<a name="volut"><h4>Redwings Volunteer Program is Growing</h4>

<p>Redwings volunteers have helped the horse sanctuary reach new horizons.  A big horse hug and thank you goes out to each and every one of you.</p>

<p>New volunteer positions are created often.  Each person either contributes services they are already skilled at or may choose to learn something new.  Volunteer positions include: technical assistance, marketing, public relations, multi-media advertising, public outreach, special events, photography and videography, ranch work, lobbying, long distance awareness assistance, etc.</p>

<p>We are always building on our volunteer program.  This year we will offer certificate courses in many areas of operation at the sanctuary. Interested in volunteering?  Call Michelle at (408) 633-0884.</p>

<p>Editor's note: Michelle works around the clock as a volunteer herself coordinating this program - Let's all remember to give her a "big horse hug" too! </p>

<a name="thanks"><h4>Thank You, Jim and Butch!!!</h4>
<p>Redwings supporter, Butch Clooney, has donated his classic 1951 Case tractor to the Sanctuary.  Through a grant from the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Youth Fund, and mechanical abilities of Jim Turcotte,we now have a beautiful tractor!  Jim worked many hours during his days getting it in tip-top shape for Redwings.</p>

<a name="one"><h4>One Person Can Make a Difference</h4>
<p>We recently received a letter that we knew all our supporters must see.  It is a shining example of the difference each of you make for the horses.</p>

<p>Dear Redwings: </p>

<p>I implore the public to take an animal abuse situation in hand and put a stop to it.  I have done so many times.  One person can make a difference.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Arcadia started having Fall fairs.  I went to the second one and to my dismay they had riding ponies on leads that kept them walking at a fast pace Tied were two ponies in reserve.  I noticed one holding its foot up, unable to put it to the ground and seemed  to be in pain.  I tried to question the man in charge, but ignored me, being only interested in blood money.</p>

<p> I wrote the Arcadia Chamber of Commerce and complained and also enclosed an article where mechanical rides could be rented and suggested they use these instead of riding ponies.  I also called the director of my Humane Society and he in turn called the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>I am happy to tell you there have been no more riding ponies, but several mechanical rides for several years now.  It's better to champion a losing cause you believe in than to keep your silence and risk nothing. Dot Marsan - Arcadia </p>
