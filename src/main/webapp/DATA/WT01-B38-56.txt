<h1>George Remus - a Prohibition Saga</h1>

<p><b>Summarized by Bob Ramsey</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The story of George Remus is fascinating in its own right,
emcompassing love, jealousy, crime, enormous wealth, retribution,
murder, and courtroom drama. It also shows very clearly how
prohibition warps society with irresistible incentives. </p>

<p>This version of the story is excerpted from THE LONG THIRST-
PROHIBITION IN AMERICA: 1920-1933 by Thomas M. Coffey WW Norton
&amp; Co, New York City 1975 </p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS:</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>George Remus was born in Germany in 1876 and migrated to
Chicago at the age of 5. </p>

<p>His father was incapacitated when he was 14 and George
supported the family by working at a pharmacy, which he bought at
age 19. Within 5 more years, he bought another drugstore,
married, and had a daughter. He became a lawyer in 1900, at age
24. </p>

<p>He specialized in criminal defense, especially murder, and
became rather famous. By 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year (when
gold was $20 per ounce). He divorced after developing an ongoing
affair with his beautiful and ambitious secretary (Imogene), who
had a 13 year-old daughter (Ruth). Alcohol Prohibition started in
January 1920, and within a few months Remus saw that his clients,
a generally crude and ignorant lot, were becoming very wealthy
very quickly. He was sure he could do better than them with his
intelligence and knowledge of the law. </p>

<p>He memorized the Volstead Act (that enforced prohibition) and
found loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmacies
so as to sell liquor to himself under government licenses for <u>medicinal
purposes</u>. Most of the liquor would disappear on the way to
market. He moved to Cincinnati because 80 percent of America's
bonded whiskey was within 300 miles, and bought up most of
America's best-known whiskey manufacturers. </p>

<p>In less than three years he made $40 million ($760M in 1995
dollars). He bribed hundreds of police, judges, and government
officials including $500,000 to the U.S. Attorney General. </p>

<p>George and Imogene held a lavish party at their new mansion on
New Year's Eve of 1922-23. The guests included 100 couples who
were as well-connected as one could imagine. At dawn the Remus's
presented all their male guests with diamond jewelry, and gave
each guest's wife a brand new automobile for the drive home. This
was the high point. </p>

<p>Prohibition enforcement stepped up shortly and Remus found
himself sentenced to two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary,
which was (for rich inmates) much like a luxury hotel. </p>

<p>While Remus was in prison, his wife Imogene took up with an
extremely handsome prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge. Dodge
soon resigned from the Bureau of Prohibition. Together, he and
Imogene liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money as
possible. They did various unkind things to him such as: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Imogene gave George $100 as his share of the proceeds
        when she sold the Fleischman Company. </li>
    <li>At one point she tried to have him deported, claiming his
        father had never become a citizen. </li>
    <li>Dodge and Mrs. Remus reportedly offered a gang $15,000 to
        murder George. </li>
</ul>

<p>Imogene proceeded to divorce him in late 1927. On the day the
divorce was to be finalized, on the way to court Remus had his
chauffeur chase the cab carrying Imogene and her daughter through
Cincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped out
screaming and shot her dead while her daughter tried to stop him.
</p>

<p>Remus the expert criminal defender was now on trial for his
life. The trial made national headlines for a month, sharing
front pages with Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Remus pleaded
temporary insanity, a novel approach at the time. </p>

<p>Having long been the most generous man in town, he was very
popular in Cincinnati, and he so successfully vilified Imogene
and her boyfriend Dodge that the jury deliberated only 19 minutes
before acquitting him by reason of insanity. The courtroom
erupted in shamefully exuberant jubilation. </p>

<p>The state of Ohio then tried to commit him to an insane asylum
since the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted by
their previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's three
well-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murder
because was not insane. </p>

<p>Remus tried to get back into bootlegging, but soon retired
when he found that the market had been taken over by vicious,
well-armed gangsters. He moved across the Ohio river to a
(relatively) modest home in Covington, Kentucky, and lived out
his life for another 20-odd years in relative obscurity. </p>
