UK:  DIRECT LINE'S FAMOUS LITTLE RED TELEPHONE KEEPS ON RINGING

DIRECT LINE, the direct insurer founded in 1985, is back in the
headlines again. The latest official statistics show it has grown to
become the leading comprehensive motor insurer in the UK - and by a
long way!

The insurer, whose distinctive red telephone logo has become a
household name in just ten years thanks to inspired brand management,
has seen its market share grow from 4.8 percent four years ago to 11.2
percent, according to the latest figures from Datamonitor.

"This phenomenal growth has been due to the development of a strong
brand image and a policy of undercutting the prices of most of its
closest rivals by leaving out the middleman - the broker," states the
report from the London-based research and management consultancy.

Datamonitor based its research on end-1994 returns filed by insurance
companies with the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) and,
according to Direct Line's Adrian Webb, the gap between it and its
competitors has further widened since then.

"We have now attained a figure of 2.2 million motor policies - nearly
twice as many as our nearest rival," Webb told BMI.

This rapid rise in market share can be attributed in part to the highly
competitive rates offered by Direct Line - it claims to have expenses
of 11 percent, compared to an industry average of 25 percent, and it
passes much of its economies onto the customer.

However, insurers like Eagle Star and Norwich Union have launched their
own direct insurance operations with competitive rates, and Direct Line
now finds itself competing directly with these as well as Churchill
Insurance and others. So, how does it continue to gain ground so
rapidly, at the expense of its rivals? Many have attributed its success
story to the memorable brand image, described by one corporate image
consultant as "a marketing director's dream".

"A strong brand is one of the most important elements we have going for
us," Webb said. "There is a huge awareness of the Direct Line brand in
the market. I think that when people are thinking of phoning around for
a quote, ours is one of the first names that springs to mind."

Webb attributes this success to a strong branding strategy, and ongoing
brand advertising on radio, TV, and in the national press. "We have
ongoing campaigns to build brand awareness, or rather to build on the
brand awareness that already exists," he said. "Direct Line has been on
either TV or radio almost every day since 1990." The overall marketing
budget for 1995 was #25 million ($38.64 million).

Direct Line's foray into the home and contents insurance market has
also been, to say the least, a great success. It had been offering such
policies since 1988, but in quite a"subdued" way until 1992 or 1993
when Direct Line put its weight behind the marketing of this section of
the business. The company is now the largest household insurer in the
UK.

ITALY:  ROYAL REVOLUTION IN LOMBARDY

ROYAL INSURANCE of the UK launched its direct selling operation in
Lombardy on January 15, in a bid to provide direct motor insurance to
car owners in the Greater Milan area. The launch was preceded and
accompanied by a major marketing campaign, using the slogan
"Rivoluzione Inglese" (English Revolution), a play on the initials of
the UK insurer.

Royal declined to disclose the campaign budget "for reasons of
competition", but the first phase of the campaign began after Christmas
and ran until the launch date, with teaser posters appearing in the
Milan Metro, in bus shelters, on buses, and in other outdoor sites
around the region.

The second phase got under way on the launch day, when new posters
giving a direct response number were accompanied by radio spots and
adverts in the national dailies.

"In Italy, it is illegal to refuse motorists insurance," a spokesman
told BMI. "So, basically, we are targeting the 25-60 age group, with
better risk profiles. The 1.5 million drivers who fit that profile in
the Greater Milan area - that's the pool we will be fishing in."

According to Royal, market research undertaken after the liberalisation
of the Italian insurance market last year showed that while customers
were generally content to deal with agents, a growing number wanted the
option to deal direct with their insurer.

The new operation is closely modelled on Royal's other direct writing
operations in the UK and Spain, and fits into the insurer's strategy of
developing multi-channel distribution of personal lines business.

Customers will have a choice between receiving a quote by phone or, for
a more personal service, going along to Royal's drive-in basement at
its headquarters where they can deal directly with sales people,
inspectors and claims assessors.

Royal's strategy is to use this initiative as a testing ground, the
spokesman said, at least for the short term."When we see how this goes,
we may in the future consider further expansion in Italy."

US CARD ISSUERS SPONSOR SPORTS

CREDIT CARD issuers and organisations are spending millions on
sponsorship, particularly of sporting events, in order to enhance their
brand image.

The latest industry deal saw MasterCard sign a $2 million exclusive
deal with the National Hockey League last month, while it continues to
promote its gold cards at high profile golf tournaments like the PGA
Grand Slam and the Colonial. Three more important golf sponsorship
deals are on the cards, according to a MasterCard spokeswoman.

MasterCard is also heavily involved in soccer events, and is reported
to have already paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 World Cup
championships in France - a four-year package of associated
sponsorships leading up to the championship which is said to be worth
$40 million. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 million in
relation to World Cup 1994 in the US.

Visa too is extremely active in the sponsorship field, and is reported
to have spent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights
on the National Football League, the Elton John tour and some
destination deals.

American Express signed on with the National Basketball League in May,
paying $30 million for three years, as well as signing a sponsorship
deal with the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of
Texas Stadium, despite Visa's sponsorship supremacy over the football
league as a whole.

Cards sponsorship activity dates back to the 1984 Olympics when
American Express was a leading sponsor, but Visa subsequently took over
in 1988, and has had great success exploiting its exclusive Olympics
sponsorship rights. Such high profile sponsorship opportunities don't
come cheap, however. Visa reportedly paid $40 million for the 1992 and
1996 Olympics.

Credit card companies are not alone in their enthusiasm for sponsorship
as a marketing tool. Sponsorship will top $5.4 billion in the US next
year, said Jim Andrews, vice-president of IEG, a consultancy
specialising in sponsorship. That is 15 percent higher than the $4.7
billion forecast for the whole of 1995.

PROFILING TODAY'S INTERNET USER

A JUST-PUBLISHED survey allows us to draw a profile of today's typical
European Internet user, and gives pointers as to what is likely to grab
his or her (although the ladies represent only 12 percent of users for
the present) attention when surfing the Net.

According to the survey by Durlacher Multimedia of London The Internet
in 1996: An investment perspective, the average Internet user is aged
between 22 and 36 with an annual income of between #13,000 ($20,000)
and #20,000. He spends between six and ten hours a week on the
Internet, has probably made one purchase through the World Wide Web,
and would be more likely to do so if happier with the security issue.

Durlacher claims its 190-page report is the "first substantial
European-orientated survey of the Internet", and would like to see it
become a benchmark for subsequent studies. Its findings are numerous
and varied.

"The World Wide Web is doubling in size every three months," said
Geoffrey Chamberlain, chief executive of Durlacher Multimedia.
"Approaching 100,000 Web sites are forecast by early 1996."

The authors concluded from their research that the first wave of
successful Internet-related businesses will include Internet access
service provision, Internet software applications provision and
Internet consultancy. The second wave will be dominated by content
provision, including provision by the financial services institutions.

The study also forecasts that by early 1996, 33.4 million users will be
connected to the Internet, and that by 2002, more than 200 million
people worldwide will be connected to at least part of the Internet,
with 150 million subscriptions to on-line services.

Security comes up again as an issue. Of 250 respondents, 23 percent had
made one or more purchases via the Web, and 87 percent expressed
interest in doing so. Fifty-seven percent stated that improved security
would certainly encourage them to shop via the Web. The authors believe
secure transaction standards will be set before the end of 1996.

According to the report, analysts expect worldwide on-line advertising
to be worth $200 million in 1996, and to top $1 billion by the end of
the next decade.

ADVANCE BANK AHEAD IN AUSTRALIAN INTERNET RACE

ADVANCE BANK, Australia's sixth-largest bank by assets, is living up to
its name with its latest service offering to customers. It has just
become the country's first bank to allow customers access to their
accounts via the Internet. Other banks are offering product information
services on the Net in Australia.

The 300,000 or so customers of Advance's Quickphone service can now
access their accounts with their Advance card number and Quickphone PIN
when they enter the bank's World Wide Web site.

The bank is not only hoping for a large response from existing
customers, but hopes also to catch the eye of potential new customers
who will be able to view a demonstration when they call up the Advance
Web site.

Transfer funds

At first, the service will just allow business and personal customers
to call up account information, but the plan is to enhance the facility
so as to allow customers to transfer funds between accounts, make loan
repayments and see a full month's statement.

Australian banks have been cautious about providing Internet banking
because of the security issue, and have tended to sit back and wait for
the US to lead the way as regards developing security technology. With
reportedly over 900,000 Australians now regularly surfing the Net,
however, many banks have opened sites on the World Wide Web over the
past year.

These pages generally contain advertising-type information as opposed
to any real banking service. In other words, at present, most banks are
using the Internet mainly as an advertising medium.

One of the more high profile initiatives, Priority One, was set up by
AMP in October to offer home loans from the World Wide Web. It
reportedly received 7,000 queries in the first six weeks, but it
admitted that the conversion rate of Internet inquiries is lower than
from traditional inquiries.

Web presence

Back in September, Westpac launched a Web site containing loan
information. National Australia has its presence on the Web, and the
Commonwealth Bank is developing sites both on the Web and on the
Microsoft Network. In December, St George announced its Internet site
which it claims is more "interactive" than other bank pages.

With the assistance of Techway, a leading Australian information
technology company, Advance is confident that security is not a
problem. All customer information is encrypted for transmission in both
directions over the Internet so the information remains secure, it
claims.

"[Techway] has studied worldwide trends in all aspects of security on
the Internet and it can confidently claim to have secure Internet
transaction software that sets world class standards," a spokesman
said.

Although Advance has beaten its rivals to the post as regards providing
an Internet banking service, the initiative will not provide the bank
with an exclusive advantage in the market. Techway is also"talking
informally" with several others, and seems determined to market its
technology to two or three of Advance's rival banks.

NAB OFFERS LOAN APPROVAL OVER PHONE

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA Bank, the country's largest bank by assets, has
launched what it describes as "the first concerted move into telephone
banking in Australia", offering a special telephone loans service for
personal customers.

The bank claims that its customers can now have a home loan approved in
less than 25 minutes. The service also offers approval for credit
cards, personal loans and term deposits over the phone, typically in
around 15 minutes, according to NAB. It is available to customers
anywhere in Australia seven days a week between 8am and 9pm.

Until now, Australian banks have provided customers with inquiry
services and basic transactions over the phone, the bank claims.
Indeed, NAB itself already offers these various possibilities through
its telephone banking service.

"This new service ushers in true telephone banking, whereby customers
can be provided with major services over the phone," said managing
director Don Argus.

National Telephone Bankers - as the service is called - uses a
computer-based credit assessment system, developed by the bank over the
past two years, allowing the "National Telephone Banker to give or
refuse loan approval in a matter of minutes.

"A decision is made during the initial phone call in almost all cases,"
Argus said."The National is the only bank offering this level of
convenience."

If a loan is approved, all that remains is for the customer in question
to call into a branch, have his or her income verified, and sign the
loan documents.

The launch of the service follows a six-month pilot in New South Wales
and South Australia, which exceeded all expectations, with operators
fielding over 1,000 calls a day. NAB expects to approve over 7,000
loans in the first year in service.

CCF LAUNCHES REMOTE `BRANCH' SERVICE

FRANCE'S CCF has launched a new remote banking service, Banco PC. It is
the first European banking management software program developed on a
PC, according to the bank. This interactive banking service goes far
beyond a simple data transfer on personal finance software. CCF defines
it as a real bank branch accessible by PC - a new remote banking format
which gives CCF an even broader range of services.

Banco PC is built around three main services: Banco PC Branch,
("Agence"), Banco PC Self Management, "Libre Gestion") and Banco PC
Budget. A fourth service is still in development - Banco PC Boutiques
(retail shops).

Banco PC Branch is a remote banking service via PC using the concept of
combining a bank branch graphic with a windows environment. It gives
access to basic banking services such as account balances, deposits,
credit lines, and so on, in the visual environment of a bank branch.

Banco PC Self Management can transfer a bank statement directly to a
spread sheet such as Excel or Lotus 1,2,3. This eliminates
time-consuming data entry or downloading from the Minitel. Banco PC
Budget allows the client to follow a budget using a personal financial
management software program. The CCF has signed an initial partnership
agreement with Intuit for its budget management program Quicken. Thanks
to this agreement, CCF clients using Quicken can record their banking
operations onto their respective Quicken documents to facilitate the
supervision and analysis of their spending.

CCF plans to add other partners to its initial software agreement.
Banco PC Boutiques will give CCF clients the possibility of shopping
directly from their PC, much as they are already doing through the
Minitel (Bancoscope).

The range of Banco PC services are accessible through a PC with a
windows environment, equipped with a modem and a telephone connection.
Banco PC services cost Fr29 ($5.89) monthly for the first service (any
of the four mentioned), and Fr10 for each additional service, with a
maximum monthly charge of Fr49 (tax included). The Banco PC software is
free of charge, as is the service help-line.

To aid its clients in equipping themselves, CCF offers an internal
high-speed modem at a cost of Fr1,000 (the average retail price is
Fr1,500). For their clients who don't have a computer, the multimedia
IBM Aptiva can be obtained with direct delivery from IBM.

This evolution of CCF's long-distance banking services demonstrates its
willingness to respond to the changes in consumer demand and,
therefore, its clients' needs. Currently, 10 percent of French
households have computers and by the year 2000, it is expected that 40
percent will be fully equipped.

SOCIETE GENERALE REMOTE SERVICE EXTENDED

SOCIETE GENERALE'S 680,000 clients in Paris and Hauts de Seine (one of
the more affluent regions in the Paris area) have received along with
their December bank statement the announcement of the new telephone
remote banking service, Vocalia Service, complete with phone number and
the necessary code number.

In November, Societe Generale decided to go ahead and launch Vocalia
Service without the agreement of the unions. The 680,000 clients
concerned are able to reach a "teleoperator" from Tuesday to Friday
from 8am to 9pm, and on Mondays and Saturdays from 9am to 5pm. This is
the first service available following a pilot which was carried out
with the 120,000 clients of six branch groups in the Paris area, and
using different operating times (5pm to 9pm from Tuesday to Friday and
9am to 5pm on Saturdays). As of the second quarter of 1996, this
service will be extended to all 3.5 million Societe Generale clients.

The appointed teleoperators belong to the Societe Generale staff.
Previous to the launch of the service, most operators worked in the
bank's network as client managers and were then trained to work on the
phone.

A Societe Generale spokeswoman insisted that this new service is the
result of developments predating Compagnie Bancaire's Banque Directe
entry onto the market.

"We launched the first platform with essentially Parisian groups,
practically at the same time as Banque Directe was launched," she
said."It is therefore a fully-developed project in Societe Generale,
and not just a reaction to Banque Directe." At present, the service
only concerns Paris and the Paris area.

The French unions involved have refused to accept any agreement
concerning working on a rota basis. In order to bypass this obstacle,
SocGen management decided to have Vocalia Service set up two separate
platforms enabling the service to operate on a timetable of more than
eight hours. Each platform is situated in a different location to avoid
having to set up any form of relay or rota teamwork. The 1937 decree on
bank's working hours is thus respected.

Despite this, the CFDT (Confederation Francaise Democratique du
Travail, one of the French unions) tried to stop Vocalia Service from
being launched in this fashion, by going to court.

The court, however, dismissed the case, and there was no appeal. The
service, which had been on hold pending the decision, was launched
immediately afterwards.

BANKS FUEL DIRECT MAIL BOOM

BANKS MADE a considerable contribution to the strong growth in direct
mailings last year, resulting in another record quarter for direct mail
volume. This was one of the findings of recent research from the Direct
Mail Information Service (DMIS) in London.

It was a good year all round for the direct mail industry. Figures from
the DMIS show that between July and September 1995, direct mail volume
hit 700 million items - up 4.2 percent on the same period in 1994.

Second only to the retail sector - which saw an increase in direct mail
volume of 25 percent - the banking sector increased its volume of
direct mailings by 21 percent to 202 million items for the same three
quarters.

Expenditure on direct mail in the July to September 1995 period was up
3.5 percent on the previous year, at #264.2 million ($400 million).
With only the final quarter figures to come, the DMIS expects
expenditure to hit the $1 billion mark for the second year in a row -
total expenditure was 1.05 billion in 1994.

FIRST DIRECT WINS SERVICE AWARD

FIRST DIRECT, the UK's first direct bank, has won the 1995 Customer
Champion Award, as well as the Best Financial Customer Service award,
presented by Unisys and The Sunday Times.

"We were delighted to be recognised for the standard of customer
service we offer," customer services project manager Amanda Stott told
BMI. "From the launch of First Direct, we have always set out to be the
best in the world, and customer service has been a key priority."

Stott outlined various initiatives which are designed to ensure that
customer satisfaction remains high at First Direct. QUEST (Quality
Undertake Every Single Time) is a staff suggestion scheme, which allows
management to get feedback from those working directly with the
customers, and to get ideas from the customers themselves.

"Action Teams" exist too in every department, where members of staff
get together regularly and have "brainstorming" sessions.

Regular customer satisfaction surveys are also an important way of
monitoring consistency, according to Stott. Once new customers have
reached the end of their "welcome period", questionnaires are
automatically sent out, so as to catch any problems early on in the
process. These new arrivals are asked how the account opening process
went; if they had any problems; and, if so, were they dealt with
swiftly and effectively. The responses to these questionnaires are
monitored monthly.

What is more, each quarter, a survey of established customers is
carried out, involving a mailing of 10,000 or so questionnaires. First
Direct itself carries out the survey for the first three quarters, and
has the final quarter executed independently by NOP.

That said, many banks carry out similar initiatives and yet customer
satisfaction is low. Where are they going wrong?

"We had the added benefit of starting from scratch, of starting with a
clean slate," Stott mused."We carried out extensive market research on
the banking industry, and we were very careful when recruiting.
Remember that, as the banks move towards customer service, they are
having to re-educate their people's thinking."

RBOS DEFENDS ITS TESSA

ROYAL BANK of Scotland has defended the performance of its TESSA
following a damning article, headlined Royal rip-off, that appeared in
the latest Which? - the magazine published by the British Consumers
Association.

"Savers who put their money in the Royal Bank of Scotland TESSA may
find they get less than they bargained for - around #250 [$388] less,"
states the article in question. The magazine criticises the Royal Bank
Tessa because interest is not compounded, but rather is credited to the
account at the end of the five-year term.

"What Which? has failed to do is to look at the whole picture," said
Frank Kirwan, UK director of retail banking at the bank. "The
association has only looked at one element of our return, and forgotten
all about the additional bonuses we offer. What matters to the customer
is not the method of calculation, but the total return investors
receive on their savings.

"Independent surveys show that the overall return to savers on the
Royal Bank TESSA is one of the best available from a high street bank,
and ahead of many of the leading building societies. Indeed, research
by Moneyfacts and Blay's place it second to the TSB and ahead of the
`Big Four'."

Kirwan pointed out that the TESSA was designed for those investors who
held them to maturity."It was always meant to be a long-term savings
medium."

He cited the Moneyfacts research, which placed Royal's TESSA second to
TSB as regards return. Assuming that the TESSA was opened at launch
with the maximum investment of #3,000 and that maximum contributions
had been made on the anniversary of each year after that, the projected
maturity value would be #11,870, compared to TSB's figure of #11,904.

SPAIN:  BANKS OPT FOR ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION

AS A RESULT of new banking legislation introduced in July 1995, a
number of Spanish banks have begun to explore the possibility of
developing tied agents networks to supplement their traditional
distribution channels. Bankinter is one of those to pilot such an
initiative.

Although banks have used financial advisers and insurance agents to
market financial products in the past, no legal framework which defined
and regulated the role of financial agents previously existed.

The new law defines financial agents as mediators who, without being
employees of the bank, habitually carry out determined banking
activities on its behalf. The legal text stresses that financial agents
must respect the same standards of transparency as banks, and cannot
represent more than one bank or consolidated financial group, nor
operate through sub-agents. That said, it is the bank or financial
group that will be held responsible for any failure by the agent to
comply to banking standards and regulations.

This introduction of the financial agent is as a result of EC
legislation which allows banks to operate in other member states
without being obliged to have a banking presence there. However, it is
thought that tied agents networks might also prove a popular option for
the smaller domestic banks. Combining an agent network with a telephone
banking service could be an effective way for banks to reach a wider
market, at a relatively low cost.

Bankinter, one of Spain's most dynamic second-tier banks, has already
begun to recruit financial agents on an experimental basis and,
according to a bank spokesman, hopes to have drawn up a definite
network plan within the next two months.

Bankinter, which has a very small network - 253 branches -compared to
its rivals, hopes tied agents will help it to expand rapidly in regions
where it has no branch presence, as well as reinforcing its existing
branch network.

PORTUGAL:  MUNDIAL GETS IMAGE OVERHAUL

CIA SEGUROS Mundial Confianca, one of Portugal's largest insurers, is
currently undergoing a radical image overhaul in a programme that will
have cost the institution an estimated Esc400 million ($2.67 million)
by the end of 1996. Mundial Confianca is the country's third-largest
non-life insurer and its eighth-biggest life insurer.

The basic aim of the company's new image is the portrayal of stability,
and at its core is the slogan "Live safely because life is a roller
coaster". The company has also changed its emblem from red and brown to
blue and yellow.

"The old emblem was 15 years old and no longer reflected our corporate
identity," explained Paolo Bracon, Mundial Confianca's head of
marketing, adding that the new colours are also those used by Banco
Totta e Acores (BTA) and Credito Predial Portugues (CPP), both of which
are controlled by the owner of Mundial Confianca, Antonio Champalimaud.
"We want to show our customers that we are part of a much larger
private financial grouping."

The launch of the new look, at the end of 1995, was accompanied by a
major publicity campaign using all forms of media advertising. The
campaign, which was designed by marketing company Neovox, is to
continue throughout 1996 and, according to Bracon, the company will be
using this opportunity to launch a whole range of new products
throughout the year, aimed principally at the personal lines sector.

"We are not looking to corner any particular segment of the market,
however," he said. "We are a universal insurance company which can
cover the needs of the entire market. So, while this year we will be
concentrating on one particular area, we will not be doing so at the
expense of other areas." Indeed, a whole range of Mundial Confianca
products will soon be available in all BTA and CPP branches. Mundial
Confianca already markets its products through another bank owned by
Champalimaud, Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor."This will allow us to greatly
increase the number of clients, which currently stands at about
600,000," Bracon said.

VIDEOCONFERENCING AT IMPERIO

PORTUGAL'S LARGEST insurer, Cia seguros Imperio, has launched a
videoconference booth network in 20 of its branches across the country
- a first for Portugal, it claims.

The new interactive system, called "Video Servicio-Imperio 24", allows
a client to communicate at any time of the day or night with a customer
services officer in the specially-designed booth which is equipped with
only a computer screen and a telephone receiver. It also has a backup
system whereby the client can obtain information without having to
speak directly to the officer, simply by touching the screen.

"The system allows a client to get up-to-the-minute information on any
of our products: how much it will cost to insure the contents of his
house or how much his automobile insurance has gone up, etc," said
Imperio's marketing director, Eugenia Coimbra. "The client can also use
it to make an appointment with one of our agents. However, the real
point of the new system is not just to complement our existing
services, but rather to introduce a human factor."

Pilot trials on the booths revealed that many people initially felt
extremely uncomfortable in them, but Imperio said it does not view this
as a real problem, "as the reaction to Multibanco booths was much the
same when they first appeared". Its primary targets are executives and
educated people "who don't like to stand in queues and are not afraid
of new technology".

Financially, the system has a clear advantage for the company, Coimbra
said."It allows us to provide a 24-hour customer service with a minimum
of staff and reduces the work-load of our staff during office hours."

Imperio plans to increase the number of these booths in its branches to
80 by the end of 1996 alone, and the long-term strategy is to have them
fitted in all its branches. Similar booths are also to be fitted into
Banco Mello branches, which controls Imperio.

GERMAN BANKS RULE OK

Recent research commissioned by the German Bankers Association suggests
that customer satisfaction with the banking industry there is high. Ann
O'Dea analyses some of the findings

AROUND 88 percent of customers are satisfied with the service they
receive from the German banking industry. This is one of the findings
of a representative study carried out by IPOS (Institute for
Practically-oriented Social Research) of Manheim, and commissioned by
the German Bankers Association (Bundesverband deutscher Banken).

This represents a rise in satisfaction of 4 percentage points, when
compared to a similar survey carried out by IPOS in the spring of 1995,
and will be a relief to banks at a time when many European banks are
coming in for severe criticism from their retail customers.

The recently-published results are based on 1,303 interviews, made by
telephone from October 30 to November 2 1995. The total of those who
were questioned is "a representative sample of voting citizens in
Germany", the association said.

The respondents were questioned on various points: the level of trust
in their service providers; analysis of competence; location of their
accounts; judgment of performance; standard of personal advice;
confidentiality; influence of banks on the economy, specifically on
politics.

There was little fluctuation in satisfaction levels between different
types of institutions; commercial banks, savings banks and co-operative
banks. According to the association, this general satisfaction suggests
that the financial service providers take justified criticism
seriously, and are making an effort to improve. Those who confirmed in
writing that they are receiving an improved personal service rose from
28 percent in the spring, to 33 percent in November.

Customers were also asked to comment on the perceived competence of the
banks and, in this area, the commercial banks have the edge. While 57
percent were of the opinion that there is no difference between
institutions in this respect, and 19 percent left the question
unanswered, 14 percent believed that commercial banks display the
greatest competence. Only 5.6 percent pointed to savings banks and 4.4
percent co-operative banks.

As regards the standard of personal advice (see table 2), over half the
respondents said the level has "hardly changed", but 32.6 percent
believed it has improved.

The findings on standards of personal advice contrasted significantly
with results of a recent survey by watchdog Finanztest (see BMI 63)
which suggests that most retail banking customers are given scanty and
ill-considered advice.

Researchers posed as would-be customers seeking advice, and visited the
branches of 21 different banks. The result? One-third of the 147 advice
sessions were rated as "unsatisfactory" or"poor". This of course
suggests that customers would be less aware of the shortcomings of one
bank's investment advice than would be the various financial watchdogs.

Customers were also asked if they felt that information on citizens'
financial relationships was kept confidential by the banks and savings
banks in Germany. While 46.5 percent believed it is, a significant 45.8
percent did not.

Respondents also answered questions on how they perceived the influence
of the banks on the economy and on politics. While 4.1 percent said it
is not enough, and 30 percent said it is just right, over 50 percent of
respondents felt that banks have too great an influence on the economy.
Again, a high 44.6 percent of respondents felt their financial
institutions have too great an influence on politics.

BFG BANK STIRS GERMAN MARKET

BfG Bank believes Germany is seeing a trend towards lower bank charges,
and has decided to anticipate that trend with free banking. BMI takes a
look at the bank's marketing strategy

THE FIRST nationwide German bank to introduce free banking hopes to
double its market share within two years and use cross-selling to
compensate for the lost bank charges.

After carrying out extensive market research on a new strategy for its
retail banking business, BfG Bank has come up with a non-traditional
response. Rather than reducing its cost base and establishing a
stand-alone direct bank, the medium-sized institution has decided to
rely on the strengths of its existing branch network and offer free
banking across the board.

Above all, BfG hopes to increase its market share - which is currently
just under 1 percent - to 2 percent in just two years. "The savings
banks [Sparkassen] and co-operative banks have the dominant position
with an 87 percent market share," said Paul Wieandt, chairman of the
board of managing directors. "Therefore, BfG Bank has to offer
something different from its competitors - and where it counts - in
order to have an impact on the market."

Free banking may be old hat in other markets, but BfG's idea has
created a stir in Germany. Although no-fee accounts have been tried
before by small regional banks, BfG is the first nationwide institution
to attempt it. Last year, one of the big banks, Bayerische Hypotheken-
und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank), offered free banking for an introductory
period of six months but had little success, probably because of a
flawed marketing strategy (see BMI 61). By contrast, BfG intends to
make its free banking service permanent.

Known as BfG plus, the new BfG current account offers an unlimited
number of free transactions, personal advice in BfG branches, use of
ATM machines, Eurocheques, an EC card and a Visa card. Unusually for
the German market, there is no additional charge for telephone banking
services and no extra fees on overdrawn accounts, as long as the
customer adheres to the agreed overdraft limit (except credit
interest).

BfG admits that free banking will be a loss-maker unless the service
attracts a substantial number of new customers (60,000 in the first
year alone) and earns new income from cross-selling. In the past, BfG
current account customers have opted for an average of two further
products from the bank and its allfinanz partners.

Thus, the success of the venture depends crucially on the selling and
advisory skills of branch-based staff, and, consequently, BfG is
planning to improve its expertise. "Our advantage is the bank's size,"
Wieandt said. "As a medium-sized bank . . . we are able to come up with
initiatives and new products which small regional banks could not
afford to offer and which would be too expensive, i.e. unprofitable,
for our large competitors."

BfG has a network of 178 branches, compared with the 1,000 or so
branches run by its largest competitors such as Commerzbank and
Deutsche Bank. That network was slimmed down during a restructuring
several years ago.

Free banking is also BfG's long-term response to a range of strategic
challenges, which Wieandt mapped out:

- Branch-based banks such as BfG are under threat from non and
near-banks, which already control 10 percent of the retail financial
services market, and from direct banks, which Wieandt believes will
grab 15 percent of the market within five years.

- Germany is over-banked and over-branched. It has one branch for every
1,500 people, compared with 2,500 in the UK. By the year 2000, BfG
expects less than half of all transactions to be done in a branch,
compared with around 60 percent at present.

- Customers are increasingly responsive to price and quality. There is
a trend towards lower bank charges, and BfG has decided to anticipate
that trend with free banking. "We aren't reducing bank charges, we're
bringing them down to zero," Wieandt said.

- It is apparently no longer true that Germans are loath to switch
banks. BfG's market research has indicated that 70 percent of retail
customers would consider changing to another bank, and around half of
them would be motivated by lower charges.

- Telecommunications are forcing the face of innovation in the German
banking market. Customers are increasingly receptive to telephone
banking, direct banking, electronic cash and PC banking.

- Many direct banks and credit card issuers now pay interest on credit
balances:

- Customers can reduce bank charges by making voucherless payment
transfers.

"The transformation of the banking market has not left the retail
banking business untouched. It has long since made the transition from
seller's to buyer's market," Wieandt said.

BfG has begun to build an innovative reputation over the past couple of
years. It was one of the first German banks to introduce telephone
banking, and, in 1993, it successfully launched an account combining
branch-based services and telephone banking. This month, the bank has
introduced the mail-order sale and home delivery of traveller's cheques
and cash in foreign currency. Furthermore, there are plans to establish
a direct broker in the spring.

Previously labelled the"trade union" bank and regarded as highly
traditional in strategy and marketing, BfG Bank was owned by a
union-controlled holding before its sale to Credit Lyonnais in 1992.
The CL-BfG deal was the first sale of a large German bank to a foreign
institution.

At the time, market observers suggested that many German banks,
weakened by low profitability, would have to decide whether they want
to make a serious commitment to universal banking or whether to look
for a niche strategy. BfG now seems to have decided to focus on retail
banking, which has always been one of its most important business
areas.

According to Wieandt, more than half of all claims on non-banks are
loans to retail customers. On the liabilities side, 40 percent of
claims from non-banks are deposits by retail customers. Moreover, the
retail banking division contributes more than half of interest and
commission earnings.

TAKING OFF THE FRILLS

Following calls from the Prices Surveillance Authority for the
abolishment of fixed account-keeping fees, the Big Four Australian
banks have announced basic no-frills accounts. BMI reports

THE BIG Four retail banks in Australia have all announced the launch of
new basic "no-frill" accounts in the past few weeks.

Banks had been set a December 31 deadline to respond to the - now
defunct - Prices Surveillance Authority's (PSA) inquiry last summer
into bank fees and charges, which resulted from public disquiet over
their high level.

Among the PSA recommendations resulting from the inquiry is a greater
use of a "user pays principle" rather than fixed account-keeping fees.
The authority also called for a "basic" account with no account-keeping
fee and a number of "free" debit transactions per month before any fees
were applied.

While each of the Big Four abolished the fixed monthly account-keeping
fees from their new offers, the other features differed from one bank
to another, and were greeted with varying reactions among consumer
bodies and the powers that be.

The Australian Consumers Association judged National Australia Bank
(NAB) to be the only one of the Big Four to have introduced an
acceptable basic transaction account. The product efforts from Westpac
Banking Corporation, ANZ Banking Group and the Commonwealth Bank were
all judged as "could do better".

NAB is pleased with the reception its new fees structure obtained, as
it feels that the changes "reflect the views of current customers and
the outcome of government and community consultation".

"We have listened to the concerns expressed about affordability, access
and the need for a more equitable approach," said Allan Diplock, chief
general manager of NAB. "The outcome is a range of options that provide
flexibility for customers and the opportunity to manage accounts in a
way that will ensure no fees are paid." This fits in well with the PSA
wish to apply the "users pay" principle, thus not penalising those who
carry out a small number of transactions per month.

The number of free transactions is one of the major bones of
contention. NAB is offering eight free transactions monthly to
customers with the `basic' account, after monitoring customer research,
while the other three allow only six.

"Our records show that in a typical month less than 10 percent of our
customers with balances below A$500 would have more than eight
withdrawals," Diplock said. "That is why we've set the free withdrawal
level at eight."

A spokeswoman for the association is also critical of the fees of
between 40 cents and 65 cents charged by Westpac, ANZ and CBA for
excess electronic transactions, particularly in view of National
Australia Bank's modest 25 cent fee.

ANZ's basic Access Simplicity account came under pressure from the
federal treasurer who refused to comment on the account the day it was
announced, whereas he had expressed satisfaction when NAB, CBA and
Westpac made their announcements.

ANZ is charging a higher than average fee for excess over-the-counter
transactions - A$1.25 - but, according to a spokesman, this is designed
to encourage customers to use an ATM or other electronic service,
rather than branch transactions which cost the bank much more. CBA's
even higher fee of A$1.50 for the same excess came under fierce
criticism from the Consumers Association.

However, Allan Fels, chairman of the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission, which took over the functions of both the PSA and
the Trade Practices Commission, recognised that all the Big Four banks
have "made moves in the right direction". The commission must now carry
out an assessment of the fees structure and report back to the
treasurer, probably before March next.

But how are the banks faring with the loss of revenue from cutting
fixed monthly bank charges? "You need to remember that while we lose
the A$2 or so monthly fixed fee, we have also added the 25 cents charge
for excess transactions, which did not previously exist," said a
spokesman for NAB."That will help offset the account-keeping fees, and
overall we believe the process will be revenue neutral."

Another new charge at NAB is the 75 cents fee for withdrawing cash from
an ATM outside the bank's own network. But customers need not fear -
the bank is busy sending out explanatory literature to all 3 million
customers.

Westpac too is going to great lengths to ensure its customers are well
informed as to the new accounts it is offering. A sum of A$3 million
has been spent on direct customer communication involving direct mail
and advertising, in order to convey the changes to its 1.5 million
customers. Westpac had a time limit in that it launched its new range
of accounts on January 15 - the remaining three will all see start-up
in March.

DESIGNING YOUR ON-LINE OFFERING

When it comes to on-line delivery, there is an increasing awareness of
the necessity for the banking industry to act now or be left behind.
BMI examines recent research on the issue

BANKS HAVE seen their market share drop over the past two decades, as
non-bank financial companies, like mortgage providers, brokerage firms
and mutual funds, have poached some of their most profitable customers.
According to the just-published second volume of The Information
Superhighway and Retail Banking, a joint report from the Bank
Administration Institute (BAI) and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG),
banks face the same risks from emerging on-line providers, unless they
can effectively use their key assets - customer relationships and
customer information.

In developing their on-line strategies, banks will have to consider at
least three options: remaining an integrated player, becoming the
customer's agent, or specialising as a product manufacturer. This is
one of the conclusions of the study.

"In all likelihood an individual bank's strategy will be a hybrid of
these three primary options," says Richard Hartnack, vice-chairman of
Union Bank, and chairman of the Centre for Banking Issues and
Strategies at BAI. "In addition, alliances among banks to aggregate
their collective capabilities and scale will play an important role."

When volume I of the report was published in the summer of 1995 (see
BMI 62), many banks still showed little interest or activity in on-line
delivery. However, as predicted by the authors at that time, the use of
on-line services and the Internet has grown significantly.

The following are some of the more significant developments since the
first part of the report was published, according to the authors:

- A marked increase in the number of banks that have signed agreements
with entities focused on on-line delivery, such as Microsoft, Intuit,
Visa Interactive and MasterBanking;

- A significant increase in the number of banks that are staking out
positions as content providers on the major on-line services;

- An explosion in Internet Web sites, by bank and non-bank players
alike;

- The joint purchase of Meca Software by BankAmerica and Nationsbank;
and

- The aggressive development of strategic payments alliances, such as
Visa and Microsoft; and MasterCard, IBM and Netscape.

The report also draws attention to the rapid growth in the number of
users of commercial on-line services and the Internet. At November
1995, there were approximately 8 million subscribers to commercial
on-line services, and about 10 million users of the World Wide Web part
of the Internet.

The result of this has been an increasing awareness of the necessity
for the banking industry to act now or be left behind, as well as a
realisation of the threats and opportunities facing banks over the next
few years.

"The task at hand for banks now shifts from deciding whether to take
action to deciding how, in what form, and at what speed," the report
states.

Two issues dealt with in detail by the study are how electronic banking
will affect customer behaviour and how banks are to determine the
design of the product offering. A segmentation analysis is used to
evaluate which customers are likely to be early adopters of on-line
delivery, and to assess likely future customer behaviour.

The conclusions suggest that the barriers to on-line delivery are lower
than might be anticipated, and that some of the most attractive
customer segments for banks seem likely to be early adopters.

              Probably will continue to use branch and teller
              Some migration to ATM and phone

Implications: Least likely to move on-line
              Some may move to screenphones, etc.
              Lower priority

But how does one forecast how customers will respond to on-line
banking? The study points to research which indicates that almost 70
percent of current financial transactions are conducted using methods
other than branches and ATMs - phones, mail and AVRUs (Automated Voice
Response Units). Almost half the remaining 30 percent are interactions
with ATMs. It concludes that customers who currently bank by phone or
ATM will migrate more rapidly to on-line banking.

"In many ways, the move from a branch to an ATM was a bigger shift for
some customer segments than the move from telephone to PC will be," the
authors say. "The first move required new behaviour; the second shift
requires a more modest change in behaviour and is accompanied by a
significant increase in functionality."

The study also makes an interesting point as regards the
cannibalisation debate. It claims that rather than rendering the branch
network obsolete, as on-line banking takes hold it will cannibalise
existing electronic bank delivery systems - "those used by the affluent
`early adopters' of technology".

There is also a feeling that the millions of dollars invested in
electronic projects, including screen-phones, may have been better
spent elsewhere. "Near term, only the PC is really viable," claims Tom
Wurster, vice-president of the Boston Consulting Group. "The slowdown
in the deployment of broadband services says to us that the PC will
dominate on-line banking for the near to medium term."

The study cites research which supports this thinking. PC with modems
will be in 40 percent of US households by the year 2000, it claims, and
one of the most attractive segments of the banking community (under 30
years, over $50,000 income) already has a PC/modem penetration of 43
percent - four to five times higher than that in households with
incomes below $30,000 (see figure 1).

The principal "roadblocks" for these key customer segments is "the lack
of compelling on-line content, easy ways to gain access to that
content, and a secure on-line payments system", the authors say, adding
rather ominously that non-bank financial services players are currently
focused on providing these latter, particularly for these attractive
customer groups.

Because the different customer segments differ radically in their
openness to on-line delivery, and use of banking products, the design
of the on-line offering necessitates a close analysis of customer
segments and product use. BCG uses a lifestyle segmentation format,
developed by US market research firm Odyssey L.P., to make general
observations on how different offerings will need to be designed to
appeal to different segments, dividing customers into three possible
target segments (see figure 2):

- New enthusiasts: upscale, typically between the ages of 30 and 60,
largely white collar;

- Surfers: a subsegment of younger households, typically more highly
educated with upscale potential; and

- Old liners: retired customers with moderate or fixed incomes,
typically below $50,000.

These three segments, the study says, constitute a significant
percentage of the overall market, and are useful starting points when
looking at the key considerations in the design of the offering by
segment.

Banks have traditionally had a lower share of wallet with the wealthier
customers between the ages of 30 and 60 - similar to the new
enthusiasts. These potentially profitable customers typically have
relationships with several financial institutions, tending to use
specialist providers for some of the larger investments, like mortgages
or mutual funds. What is more, these are likely to constitute a very
attractive on-line segment.

Attitudinal research, according to the study, would suggest that this
segment is often looking for convenience and time saving, and will
often opt for technology when offered.

An on-line offering for these customers will need to address both the
desire for convenience and their specific life cycle product needs, the
BCG concludes. A focus on the role of investment products, financial
planning, mortgages and so on may be necessary, as well as the
interactive on-line environment. The study offers the example of
"integrated information, such as an on-line net worth statement, linked
to both bank holdings and other holdings" as a core information
offering. Above all, it insists on the importance of being early with
an on-line offering to this segment, so as to gain usage and loyalty,
at a time when competing non-bank institutions are targeting this same
segment.

Another key group for which to design an on-line offering may be the
surfer-type subsegment of under-30 households. Unfortunately, this
segment is typically unprofitable for the banks. "They keep small
balances, use only a few products and generate many transactions."
However, many of these households will become attractive customers as
they grow older and more successful.

The authors suggest a streamlined offering, with lower delivery costs
while improving access and convenience, in this way increasing
profitability and retention. The on-line offering should take into
account the attitudinal and behavioural characteristics of this
segment. These customers are generally comfortable using technology and
may value the convenience of on-line delivery of statements and e-mail
inquiries. It is also a segment associated with loans and credit
facilities so an offering which includes on-line credit applications
with quick response could have particular appeal, for example.

Retired customers with fixed incomes, similar to the old liners,
represent one of those segments which are low priority when designing
on-line offerings, in the short or medium term. These latter are often
the most frequent users of the branch, and lowest users of ATMs.
Attitudinal research suggests these may be one of the hardest to switch
to on-line delivery.

In designing their on-line offerings, it is essential that the banks
consider the actions of the non-bank players who are busy designing
their own, the report insists. "Financial services has many attributes
that make it a logical and attractive candidate for on-line delivery,"
it points out. "Recent events have confirmed this view." The following
are laid out as some of the principal considerations in relation to the
design of on-line offerings:

The most innovative non-bank players have a significantly lower
delivery cost structure than banks, in part because they do not have
the investments in brick and mortar that banks do. The possibility of
on-line delivery will probably cause them to see opportunities to
further expand their customer relationships at the expense of banks.

Some of these players have strong brand positions, national presences,
and high shares of the early adopter segments of the market (e.g.
surfers, new enthusiasts).

Some of these players may also take advantage of their current brand
positions by expanding the range of products and information offerings.
These offerings can easily be outsourced.

Only by evaluating the differing motivations of the non-bank players
can the banks come to understand the likely competitive threat from the
different on-line offerings, the report warns.

The authors suggest a return to analysis of customer needs and product
characteristics. Many of the surfers and new enthusiasts, for example,
will prefer to shop for products, as opposed to having products sold to
them, and will thus react positively to an offering that includes
comparison shopping. "If banks are hesitant to promote the products of
others, their offerings will have less appeal to these customers," the
authors claim.

Banks are also reminded of their own competitive advantages -owning
current customer relations with a high level of trust, wide range of
delivery channels for customer convenience, payment systems access and
access to customer data. The report concludes that transforming this
data into customer information is one of the greatest challenges for
banks today, and will be crucial for an effective on-line presence.

The platform options available to banks are numerous and priorities
will have to be established from the start, the report says. Banks need
to decide whether to develop their service on commercial OLS (on-line
services), the Internet or both. Another option would be for banks to
develop a proprietary banking platform.

The choice of a commercial OLS provider, like Microsoft's Microsoft
Network, has advantages like access to new customers and standard
interfaces for customers to use when carrying out their on-line
transactions. The report cites the example of Fidelity Investments in
the US which has a "strategy of ubiquity", aiming to get on the maximum
number of OLS platforms as possible, while others prefer to be more
selective.

Before choosing a platform provider, the report says, it is essential
to consider the following: the on-line service's customer base; on-line
delivery development, including software skills; brand visibility and
positioning; and ownership of customer information. It will also be
necessary to look at the OLS's customer base and how it overlaps with
the bank's existing and target customer segments.

While the Internet has been the subject of much hype, and we have
recently seen the creation of an Internet-based bank, Security First
Network Bank, the report notes that it is far from certain how this
platform will develop. Despite its huge popularity, the report points
out that it is accessed by anyone, but controlled by no one, and
questions whether security on the Internet will ever be sufficient to
transact financial services.

Proprietary platforms, on the other hand, offer three principal
advantages: lack of an intermediary between the bank and the customer;
complete control over content, navigation as well as the "look" and the
"feel" of the service; and the lack of other financial service
providers vying for customers on the same platform. However, many
customers have previously demonstrated their lack of interest in
provider-specific platforms.

"Each institution must map its objectives against the alternatives and
the uncertainties before deciding where and how to participate."

Above all, BCG concludes that the banks must be alert to the
competitive threats closing in on all sides and respond effectively.

"The banking industry stands at the crossroads," says David Taylor,
executive vice-president of the BAI and co-director of the study."The
on-line services, software giants, global entertainment companies,
telcos and utilities have the pipelines and the navigational tools. If
banks don't act with foresight and firm purpose, the prognosis is for a
continuing erosion of their core retail business."

CAPTURING THE CUSTOMERS

Hong Kong is one of Asia's largest financial centres. With 1997 rapidly
approaching, Andrew Moody reports from a market where product
development takes precedence over slick marketing campaigns

FEW WORLD markets are now as attractive for marketing banking services
as Asia, where there have been dramatic increases in personal wealth
for more than a decade. Per capita incomes in many of the so-called
`Tiger' economies now exceed those in Europe and the rest of the
western world.

The region's banks face a tough challenge to develop new products and
offer ever improved services to capture this new wealth against a
background of fierce competition.

Despite the spectre of 1997, nowhere is this more true than in Hong
Kong, one of Asia's largest financial centres with more than 400
domestic and foreign banks, although only 180 of them are licensed.

Over recent months, in particular, all of the leading banks have been
launching products, hoping that a particular extra specification will
be enough to attract elusive customers.

Like western banks, they have been trying to segment the market to make
sure they do not fail to properly target the territory's burgeoning
middle class population, the result of a decade or more of GDP growth
of between 5 percent and 8 percent.

The partial collapse of the so-called Hong Kong interest rate cartel,
which made it difficult for the banks to compete on loan and deposit
rates, has also led recently to very aggressive price-driven marketing
strategies.

Despite the competition, Hong Kong banks, unlike their western
counterparts, meet with very little consumer resistance. The territory
is one of those rare places where banking and bankers are popular. The
average Hong Kong citizen has 2.4 bank accounts in 1.9 banks.

Newspapers, both Chinese and English, are scoured for any
advertisements signalling changes in deposit rates.

Talking about banking and finance over dinner would not necessarily
single you out as a crashing bore but just as someone talking about one
of the most interesting subjects around.

The challenge for the banks is therefore not to come up with slick
subliminal advertising campaigns to make banking seem exciting because,
in the minds of the consumer, it already is. Much of the marketing
literature is, therefore, matter of fact and very much to the point.

Instead, what the banks have to do is not so much to work on the image
but rather on the real products, a much more difficult exercise.

All the banks spend considerable resources on product development so
they might have that added feature which influences a consumer's final
decision.

Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, one of the leading foreign
banks in the territory, which has just moved to luxurious new offices
near Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Quarry Bay, said the marketing
challenges for the bank are very different from those in the US.

"It is a unique market in many ways. People here are very
entrepreneurial and they have that mentality," he said. "If you go to
the US, nobody in the street is going to know what the dollar exchange
rate is for the German mark but they would here.

"As a result, we have, to some extent, to launch aggressive products
which are ahead of the competition."

The leading product innovators in the market are, by common agreement,
the Hong Kong Bank, the Hang Seng Bank (62 percent owned by the Hong
Kong Bank but autonomous and independently listed), Standard Chartered,
Citibank and Bank of East Asia.

There has been much recent emphasis on packaged products in the market.
Hong Kong Bank has launched Asset Vantage which gives those that have
access to it gold trading and the ability to hold deposits in different
currencies.

And last July, Hang Seng Bank, the second-largest locally-incorporated
bank, launched its Bank-in-One account which consolidates a number of
features including flexible overdraft and 24-hour automated phone
banking to the mass market customer. This was one of 17 new products
launched by the bank last year.

Despite the risks, foreign currency accounts are traditionally very
popular, even among mid-range customers, perhaps largely because of
Hong Kong's trading nature.

Other very popular products are tax loans which people take out because
there is no PAYE or pay-as-you-go tax system in the colony.

The key products, however, are deposit accounts and mortgages. These
and not the cheque account - as in the west - are regarded as the coat
hanger product on which to build a long-term relationship.

Alex Au, managing director of the Hang Seng Bank, said the important
thing is to establish a long-term relationship with a customer.

"This is what you have to do in banking everywhere, and probably the
best way to do it is through the deposit account or mortgage," he said.

"One can read too much into this as a cultural difference between us
and the west since people here often use their deposit accounts the
same as a cheque account.

"Once you have got the customer, you can cross-sell other products,
which enables you to build your competitive strategy and market share."

The growing middle class has encouraged the banks to target their more
affluent customers.

It has even brought banks into the retail sector which weren't
previously there. One of these is ABN-AMRO which, although in the
region for 90 years, only decided to offer retail products three years
ago. These now bring in an incredible 30 percent of its Hong Kong
profits.

"We saw the middle and upper sectors of the market as a real
opportunity and we have come in with a mortgage product which has an
interest rate 0.5 percent cheaper than most of our rivals," said Sergio
Rial, ABN AMRO's general manager in Hong Kong.

"We are still very much building up our retail side but it is certainly
a marketing strategy which has already paid off."

Citibank too makes no bones about targeting the well off.

"The Hong Kong affluent are very much our target market and our minimum
to open an account is $HK50,000 ($6,465)," Citibank's Wong said.

Hong Kong Bank has gone further than most by developing new Select
branches for its upper segment customers, leaving other customers to
slum it in standard and automated branches.

But Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing and planning with
Hong Kong Bank, insisted it is not ignoring other customers.

"Although we segment the market, banking is banking is banking is
banking," he said. "We can't really offer a significantly different
service to one customer compared to another."

Branch design has come to be a key element of any marketing strategy of
Hong Kong banks.

The banks are reluctant to reveal their expenditure on branches, but
with few exceptions they are among the most splendid examples of both
interior and exterior banking architecture anywhere in the world.

Branches are not just about getting customers inside, but about making
use of the time customers spend within them. Customers very often use
their local branches as meeting places for colleagues and friends.

So, after they finish their business they often stand around engaging
in long conversations, perhaps about the day's currency movements or
the latest rate of interest in the bank around the corner.

Creating the right ambience in the banking hall is therefore important.
The Bank of East Asia deploys music, ranging from light tunes in the
morning to heavier up-beat music in the evening.

HONG KONG FACTS

Population                   6.15m
Life expectancy              Males 75.4, Females 81
GDP                          $HK151.0 billion
Per capita income            $HK24,361
Growth rate                  4.5%
Inflation                    9%
Prime interest rate          9%
Money supply (M2) increase   18%
Unemployment rate            3.5%

The branches do, however, represent greater opportunities for marketing
than in Europe. Many of the banks have installed computer displays
which give customers up-to-date information on products and markets.

As Au said: "I think in terms of branches we are very much ahead of
banks in the west. We place great emphasis on giving our customers
first class service within the branches."

Pricing in terms of interest rates on deposits and loans has become a
much more fundamental part of the marketing strategy since the
relaxation of the cartel began in October 1994.

Instead of being fixed by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, interest
rates on deposit accounts held longer than seven days are now freely
floating.

This has led to a lot of market buying with banks trying to gain market
share in new product areas by taking a loss lead position.

Some of the bigger banks are concerned about this added uncertainty in
the market, particularly in the run-up to 1997 which creates more than
a few uncertainties of its own.

The Dah Sing Bank, a new entrant to retail, has been accused of
deliberate market buying.

It launched a credit card 18 months ago with a bonus scheme which gave
it an effective interest rate 25 percent below the competition. Derek
Wong, Dah Sing's head of retail, defended the strategy.

"I think the competition is now open and fair," Wong told BMI. "It is
now a matter of how you operate your business strategy which will
determine how successful you are."

Those marketing banking products in Hong Kong are as preoccupied with
age targeting as their counterparts in the west.

Most of the banks are keen to attract students, not only because they
may prove to be lifelong customers but because they are likely to be
monogamous in their banking habits - a rare quality in Hong Kong.

They do this by offering discount credit cards and air miles, less
gimmicky offers than the record token and free gift offers of some
western banks.

"The competition for students is driven partly because of this," said
David K.P. Li, deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East
Asia. "The student does not have much money so he is unlikely to bank
with anyone else, which makes him or her a better all-round customer.
You do, however, hope to hang on to them for the rest of their lives."

Older people are also becoming increasingly a target market for the
banks. The average life expectancy for males in Hong Kong is 75.4 and
females 81, compared to 73 years for men in the US and 79 for women.
Hong Kong is therefore moving more rapidly to an ageing population than
many countries in the west.

The banks are responding by providing products geared specifically to
older customers.

W.K. Mok, deputy general manager and head of retail in Hang Seng Bank,
said investment and protection products are particularly attractive to
this market.

"We have specifically developed a greater array of insurance products
and wealth accumulation investment products to cater for this very
important market," he said. Citibank's Wong said banks are having to
think more and more of the life cycle in their product offer to
customers.

"I think you have to look at taking the customer over, for example, at
25 years. When he or she is younger, the credit card might be the
driving product, then the mortgage, then the savings account, then
foreign exchange and then insurance products," he said.

Although Asia is becoming an increasingly attractive market for banks,
it remains very difficult for outsiders to penetrate.

Banks such as Standard Chartered and Hong Kong Bank have their roots in
19th century colonisation and to all intents and purposes are local
banks rather than British ones.

Across Asia, the US and European banks which have a presence have a
long association with the region. They also have a regional
infrastructure with a network of branches across the key capitals and
financial centres.

It would, therefore, be difficult for a carpet-bagging bank just to
target, for example, Hong Kong, because it would be at an immediate
competitive disadvantage with other banks which could offer regional
services.

"I think if you were going to set up in Asia it would be very difficult
just to set up in Hong Kong. You really need a presence across the
region. You could get lost," said ABN-AMRO's Rial.

A key element of future marketing strategies will undoubtedly be China.
The branches that banks have there tend to be there to facilitate
business between the mainland and Hong Kong and for the Chinese
businessman. But, as the Chinese market liberalises and a retail
banking demand emerges, the Hong Kong banks will be in a better
position than most to take advantage.

"While Hong Kong is likely to remain a key component of the HSBC
Group's business well into the foreseeable future, our mainland
operations will grow increasingly important," said Hong Kong Bank's
Tai.

"Foreign banks are unable to deal in the renminbi, the local currency,
at present. But this will eventually change and when it does we will be
ready to take the initiative."

THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS

The way in which banks market their electronic banking services is
often fundamentally flawed, according to Richard G Lyons of Internet
Inc.

WHILE MOST retail bankers see their electronic banking services as a
priority, they are making some common mistakes in the way they market
them to their customers. This is the claim made by Richard G Lyons Jr,
executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Internet Inc.,
which operates the Most ATM network in the US.

Many retail bankers have not yet made clear the message they wish to
convey to those customers who might be interested in electronic
banking, he said at the BAI (Bank Administration Institute) Retail
Delivery Systems conference last month.

While almost 63 percent of retail bankers believe their electronic
banking services save money, only 17 percent feel their institution is
"where it needs to be in its electronic banking programme". These are
some of the results of recent research that Lyons shared with the
delegates. Only 42 percent believe their institutes "have a clear
strategy for where we're going with EFT [Electronic Funds Transfers]".

Internet's research involved extensive interviews with retail banking
managers, marketing managers and branch managers from 140 different
financial institutions. A large majority agreed that electronic banking
is a priority. Yet, many admitted they are not spending enough time or
money on it, and are not investing enough in training for staff.

Only 18 percent of interviewees agreed that "we spend enough time and
money promoting electronic banking". While 87 percent agreed that
electronic banking transactions at their institutions are increasing
every month, 73 percent admitted "Our branch personnel probably have a
lower understanding of EFT than I."

"Consumers' antennae are up higher when they need what you're selling,"
Lyons stated, insisting that banks would have a far greater degree of
success marketing their electronic services if customers were made
aware that it allows them a hassle-free lifestyle. Yet, he said, 65
percent of bankers agreed that "at account opening, we spend more time
with cheque choices than explaining electronic banking options".
Indeed, the research found that a mere 27 percent of retail bankers
agreed that their customers are "well aware of all our electronic
banking services".

Over half of the bankers interviewed felt customers are not yet ready
for many EFT programmes, but Lyons suggested this might be a false
presumption and pointed to a recent survey in which 64 percent of total
households agreed "using electronic banking services is more convenient
than going to a branch". He claimed that consumers are much more
willing to use alternative delivery channels than banks realise, and
that banks need to communicate the availability of such channels in
order to compete.

There seemed, from the research, to be a realisation among financial
institutions of the threat from non-bank institutions. While only 18
percent agreed that banks are in control of the emerging consumer
electronic delivery channels, 70 percent agreed that"Microsoft and
regional telephone companies could someday [soon] threaten to siphon
deposits away from financial institutions". Indeed, 87 percent of
interviewees felt that non-banks are in a position to compete with the
electronic banking delivery systems owned and operated by banks.

Lyons suggested that many changes in attitude are needed to be made in
order that bankers make a success of their electronic banking
strategies. What are needed are clear marketing objectives, customer
focus, effective brand management and good investment, he said.
