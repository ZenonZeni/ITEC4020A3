overview of an international co-operative effort for improving and preserving
Earth Observation satellite data products. <BR>

<BR>
<B>What is the GMS Pathfinder?<BR>
<BR>
</B>A group of research agencies, universities and government organisations
in Australian and the USA commenced the &quot;GMS Pathfinder Project&quot;
in 1995. The initial phase is expected to last until 1997. The project's
objectives are to extend the useful lifetime, and the productivity, of climate
data derived from time-series observations from the Japanese Himawari or
Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) series. <BR>
<BR>
Using peer review and inter-agency co-operation, the group will be applying
newer computing systems and more advanced methods, in order to systematically
re-process archived GMS data, initially for a &quot;benchmark&quot; period
of 18 months, from 1 July 1994 to 31 December 1995, a period which includes
the introduction of a more sophisticated sensor to the GMS series. After
evaluation of the scientific integrity of data products for the benchmark
period, a decision will be made on whether to extend the re-processing to
cover a more extensive period, possibly 1987-1997. <BR>
<BR>
It is hoped that this work will verify the utility, for climate and global
change research, of quantitative long term satellite measurements over the
Eastern Hemisphere. The GMS Pathfinder project , we hope, will increase
this utility, through the provision to the international research community
of more accurately navigated, better calibrated, more certainly classified,
and more readily accessible, data sets for the study of global change and
climate. <BR>
<BR>
<B>About GMS<BR>
<BR>
</B>The Himawari, or Geostationary Meteorological Satellite series, have
supplied continuous medium-resolution (1-5 km) data of the entire Eastern
Hemisphere, at high temporal frequency (0.5 - 3 hours), since the First
Global Atmospheric Research Program Global Experiment (FIGGE) in 1978. Time
series data from these satellites offers by far the longest sequence of
albedo and infra-red observations of the Oceania and western Pacific area.<BR>
<BR>
Versions of the Japanese-built satellite were launched in 1977, 1980, 1989,
1993, and 1995. <A HREF="#anchor5933543">Table 1</A><B> </B>gives launch

<HR SIZE="5"><B>About the Pathfinder concept<BR>
<BR>
</B>International global change research programmes, such as the International
Geosphere Biosphere Programme and the World Climate Research Programme,
require easier access to consistently calibrated and high resolution records
of albedo, temperature, vegetation condition, and other parameters which
can be derived from satellites (<B>Townshend, 1992</B>). Regional studies
have also demonstrated the power of using long time series satellite data
for change detection (<B>Graetz et al 1992</B>). However, the technological
evolution of sensors on research satellite missions means that there are
few instances of stable instrument configuration over a sufficiently long
time period to be useful for global change research. <BR>
<BR>
Growing recognition of the power of long-time series satellite data for
global climate studies - and emerging understanding of the need of satellite
data management agencies to evolve more efficient practices in the face
of exploding volumes and data rates of Earth observation data - led the
US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NASA and NOAA) to establish in 1990 &quot;Pathfinder&quot;
retrospective satellite data processing projects. Typically, the projects
evolved in four stages (<B>Booth &amp; Maiden, 1993</B>):<BR>
<BR>
Step 1. Identify data sets suitable for supporting climate and global change
research<BR>
Step 2. Transfer minimally processed archive data to working medium<BR>
Step 3. Develop &quot;scientific community consensus&quot; to define necessary
data products and determine quality control and validation procedures<BR>
Step 4. Generate, validate, and disseminate the agreed products on readily
accessible distribution media and with supporting metadata/browse support.<BR>
<BR>
Because scientific understanding and technical means in processing and storage
media have evolved, Steps 2-4 often require reprocessing of older data using
improved and consistent algorithms, and/or conversion of archival data media.
This frequently has the additional advantage of prolonging data life; reducing
handling costs; and allowing more efficient use. <BR>
<BR>
NASA and NOAA have established a number of &quot;Pathfinder&quot; projects
to generate multi-year data from AVHRR, GOES, TOVS, and the Special Sensor
Microwave Imager<B> </B>(<B>UCAR, 1994</B>). <B><BR>
<BR>
GMS Pathfinder</B><BR>
<BR>
The GMS Pathfinder, the first in the eastern Hemisphere, was initiated by
CSIRO Office of Space Science &amp; Applications (COSSA) in 1994, following
a meeting of a technical working group of the Committee on Earth Observation
Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Data at Sa&otilde; Jos&eacute; dos Campos.
This meeting noted the importance of the GOES Pathfinder project for the
developing sound practice in the management of long-term, consistently-calibrated
satellite datasets. The meeting encouraged the development of complementary
data sets leading to the creation - and widespread availability for global
change studies - of global coverage, long time series satellite data of
consistent quality, low cost and easily usable transfer media. <BR>
<BR>
CEOS is an informal, &quot;best efforts&quot; organisation, through which
participating agenices - typically, space agencies, international research
bodies, and operational agencies of the UN family - try to achieve the most
effective match between planned Earth-observing space missions on the one
hand, and the requirements of Earth observation data users (such as the
World Meteorological Organization and the Global Climate Observing System)
on the other<B> </B>(<B>CEOS, 1995</B>). The group is chaired in 1995/96
by CSIRO. <BR>
<BR>
CEOS, through its Working Group on Information Systems and Services, also
promotes the preservation of archived Earth observation satellite observations
and the adoption, by Earth observation satellite data management agencies,
of consistent practice in data format, networks, collection of auxilliary
data, and service provision. The Working Group on Calibration and Validation
devsies and implements international best practice in the verification of
quantitiative measurements from satellite sensors. <BR>
<BR>
In October 1994, CSIRO and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology jointly
proposed, for consideration by the Japan Meteorological Agency which operates
GMS, a &quot;GMS Pathfinder&quot; project (<B>Kingwell et al, 1994</B>).
Following the acceptance in principle of the project by JMA, the NASA Office
of Mission to Planet Earth approved funding for participation in the project
by Scripps Institution of Oceanography (<B>Butler, 1995</B>). This step
was important, since it ensured that lessons of the GOES Pathfinder project
would be absorbed in the GMS work (eg, <B>Simpson &amp; Globat, 1995a, b;
Frouin &amp; Simpson, 1995; Simpson, Gobat &amp; Frouin, 1995</B>, through
which work improved methods were identified for operationally removing image
artefacts [striping] caused by sensor characterisitics; for better radiometric
calibration; and for improved cloud detection). <BR>
<BR>
Application of these approaches to the historic, but poorly previously utilised
GMS archive, would together with the GOES Pathfinder data set, provide consistent,
accessible and well-documented data products for climate and global change
studies over the greater part of the Earth's surface. <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, the CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications invited the
Dr John Le Marshall of the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre, to chair
a GMS Pathfinder Science Working Group, to oversee the selection of processing
algorithms; the implementation of a processing and data management system;
and a portfolio of research projects utilising the Pathfinder benchmark
data (<B>Embleton, 1995</B>). Apart from CSIRO (represented by the new Earth
Observation Centre) and the Bureau, participants are drawn from NASA, and
universities in Australia and the USA. A close relationship is expected
to develop between the group and the Japan Meteorological Agency. A listing
of membership of the Science Working Group is given at <A HREF="overa1.htm">Attachment
1</A>, while the tasks of the group are given at <A HREF="overa2.htm">Attachment
2</A>.<B> </B><BR>
<BR>
Conclusi<B>o</B>n<BR>
<BR>
The GMS Pathfinder represents a new, systematic, and exciting approach to
the use of satellite data for climate and global change research in Australia.
If successful, the completion of the benchmark period of 1 July 1994 to
31 December 1995 will result in much improved access, all over the world,
to a quality, high spatial and temporal data set of science products derived
from the GMS satellite program<B>.<BR>
