<h1>FACTS ABOUT MARIJUANA </h1>

<h2>Marijuana: Drug of Deception </h2>

<p><b>A publication of the Lions Club</b> </p>

<p>This is the full text - unedited -- of a brochure on marijuana
put out by the Lions Club International. </p>

<p>The statements made about marijuana range from laughable to
ridiculous. None of them, that I can find, are supported by any
kind of scientific evidence, except maybe for that stuff about
the red eyes. They even say that marijuana use causes weight
loss! Curiously, they do not mention &quot;the munchies.&quot; </p>

<p>Readers are encouraged to write to the Lions Club at the
address below and correct their misinformation by pointing to
these web pages. </p>

<hr>

<p>Marijuana is made from the leaves, small stems, and flowering
tops of the Cannabis sativa plant. Marijuana, also called pot,
grass, weed, is usually smoked in a loosely- rolled joint or in a
pipe. It has a sweet, lingering odor. </p>

<p>Marijuana causes the user to experience a feeling of
well-being---of detachment from ordinary circumstances. This
&quot;high&quot; is usually followed by feelings of depression. </p>

<p>Marijuana is not just one substance; it contains more than 400
chemicals. The most widely known compund in this group is
commonly called THC (delta- 9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol). </p>

<p>THC is the primary mind-altering ingredient in marijuana. A
portion of THC is absorbed into fatty tissue in the brain and
reproductive organs, and in most other organs as well. It takes
the body at least 30 days to eliminate all effects of smoking one
marijuana joint. </p>

<p>Marijuana is up to ten times more potent today than that which
was produced in the 1960s. </p>

<p>Some experts previously thought Marijuana to be harmless. It
is now known that the reasons users can stop smoking without
feeling severe withdrawal symptoms is because of the body's
storage of THC. Effects of Marijuana on the body </p>

<p>* Marijuana reduces brain energy, impairing the users' ability
to remember, feel, think, anticipate, and predict. </p>

<p>* Because THC is stored in fatty tissues and works like a
time-release capsule, regular marijuana smoking produces a
constant state of sedation. </p>

<p>* Since THC remains in the center of motivation of the brain,
it weakens the users' ability to live drug-free. </p>

<p>* The lungs of marijuana smokers are highly susceptible to
emphysema and bronchitis. </p>

<p>* Research shows that marijuana contains cancer-causing
agents. </p>

<p>* Marijuana impairs normal sexual development in both males
and females. </p>

<p>* Heartbeat rate increses by as much as 50% through marijuana
use. Results are chest pains, and possible heart disease. </p>

<p>* Regular use causes a decrease in the blood supply to the
heart, and diminishes white cell production. </p>

<p>* The body adjusts to regular use, making it essential to
increase the amount used in order to achieve a &quot;high&quot;. </p>

<p>* Continual marijuana use deteriorates the body's immune
system. </p>

<p>Symptoms of Marijuana use </p>

<p>* Marked change in behavior patterns </p>

<p>* Carelessness about personal appearance </p>

<p>* Lack of motivation </p>

<p>* Reduction of short-term memory </p>

<p>* Excessive irritability </p>

<p>* Red eyes and fatigue </p>

<p>* Abrupt mood changes/outbursts of anger </p>

<p>* Less concern for the feelings of others </p>

<p>* Bouts of depression/paranoia </p>

<p>* Inability to react quickly/decreased coordination </p>

<p>* Inability to get along with family/co-workers/peers </p>

<p>* Loss of weight </p>

<p>* Sleeplessness [to go with the fatigue I suppose] </p>

<p>* Short concentration-span </p>

<p>* Highly susceptible to common infections </p>

<p>* Expressionless speech/blank stares </p>

<p>* Faulty perception (cannot accurately judge distances, speed
or time) </p>

<p>* Decreased academic or work performance </p>

<p>Marijuana connection </p>

<p>Some researchers have found a direct link between increased
marijuana use, and </p>

<p>--juvenile and young adult crime such as theft </p>

<p>--truancy and school drop-out rate </p>

<p>--psychiatric referrals of adolescents and young adults </p>

<p>--cases of teenage chronic organic brain syndrome (burnout) </p>

<p>Lions Drug Awareness Program </p>

<p>Since its inception in 1984, the Lions Drug Awareness Program
has emphasized prevention through education. Lions are working
together to join families, educators, and other key leaders in a
concentrated effort to create drug-free communities. </p>

<p>Lions' primary focus is Lions-Quest &quot;Skills for
Adolescence,&quot; and Lions-Quest &quot;Skills for
Growing.&quot; These positive prevention curricula span
Kindergarten through eighth grade, and are helping young people
choose healthy lifestyles. </p>
