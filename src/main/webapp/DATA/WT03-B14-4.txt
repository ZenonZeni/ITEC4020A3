Lead Story:
GE Satellite Unit Uses Gibraltar To Seek ITU Geostationary Slots

     GE Capital Satellites International, Inc., a subsidiary of
domestic satellite operator GE American Communications, Inc., has
announced an agreement with the government of Gibraltar to seek 12
geostationary orbital slots for satellite services to Europe,
Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.  

     The unit of General Electric Co. said the government of
Gibraltar has filed "applications for these orbital locations on
behalf of GE Capital Satellites International" with the
International Telecommunication Union.  "Satellites constructed and
launched to these locations would be operated from a planned
satellite control facility on Gibraltar," which is a British
dependent territory.

     A GE Americom spokesman told TRI that most of its proposed
satellites would operate in the Ku-band frequency with the
exception being one orbital slot covering the Pacific Ocean. 
Satellites covering Africa would operate in both C- and Ku-band
frequencies, he said.

     GE's statement said current plans envision using the
satellites mainly for video programming distribution, including
direct-to-home services and transmissions to cable TV system
headends and broadcast stations.  GE Americom said the planned
satellite design "would accommodate both analog and digital video
formats, as well as other uses, including VSAT [very small aperture
terminal] and data networks."

     To register plans to use geostationary orbital slots in
specific frequency bands, member government administrations notify
the ITU years in advance of government and business proposals for
new satellites.  Generally, administrations forward such
registration notices on behalf of national government entities or
companies under rules agreed to by ITU member nations.  

     In addition, the U.S. government notifies the ITU of Intelsat
satellite plans, and the United Kingdom government does the same
for new Inmarsat satellite proposals.  

     Previously, an agreement under which the Pacific island
Kingdom of Tonga registered slots for use by satellite operators
not based in Tonga led to calls for an update of the ITU "advance
notification" and registration procedures.  The ITU currently is
considering such reforms.

     Scott Blake Harris, Bureau Chief of the FCC's International
Bureau, told TRI that the bureau was not "surprised that a U.S.
corporation chose to file with the ITU through another
administration" rather than through the FCC.  

     He said, "Under no circumstances will we permit any enterprise
to be disadvantaged by having decided to file with the U.S. rather
than another administration."  GE Americom's spokesman could not
comment on the reasons for not filing with the FCC.  

     Mr. Harris said it is not clear that the agreement between GE
Americom and the government of Gibraltar is "improper or untoward." 
He noted that the move "may be appropriate," particularly "if they
don't intend to use the satellites to provide service to the U.S."

     Commenting on the need for ITU reforms, Mr. Harris said the
"whole ITU registration process is in serious disrepair.  I know
the ITU intends to look at it, but in my view, it's urgent that it
do so."  

     He added that "it's critical" that the ITU review include U.S.
government and industry participants.

Satellite Services:
New Loral Unit To Be Globalstar Managing Partner 

     As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to acquire
most of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected industry
leader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit) mobile
satellite services market.  

     Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of Loral, will become Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Loral Space and Communications Corp., a
new company to be formed in connection with the Lockheed
Martin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the managing general
partner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31% stake in Globalstar
as well as other assets.

     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from an
unprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollar
industry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management team
diminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said Robert
Kaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg Harris
in New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a focused
management team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.  

     Mr. Schwartz said at a Jan. 8 press conference announcing the
deal that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  Having
Mr. Schwartz championing Globalstar "strengthens" the global
communications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.
Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."

     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar comments
regarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record is
"very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and CEO
of Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and Vice
Chairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded the
news, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on Jan. 8.

     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martin
will buy Loral's defense electronics and system integration
businesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumed
debt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity position
in Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share.  Lockheed
Martin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral shareholders through
a tender offer that was scheduled to begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Loral
shareholders also will receive one share of Loral Space for each
share of Loral.  The transaction is expected to close by the end of
February.

     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million in
cash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will provide
Loral Space with support in key technologies while remaining a
major maker of military and commercial satellites.  In addition to
the 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will receive Loral's 33%
interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial satellite
manufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries, Inc., an
aircraft brake company.

     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral's
Globalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, and
Brazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving domestic
and international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and broadband
data services.  

     Mr. Schwartz said Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loral
holdings to expand the new company's DBS business.

     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8
billion or $7.80 a share.  After backing out cash, Globalstar
represents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  Loral
Space's book value is broken down as follows:

     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),

     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),

     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),

     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),

     *    $700 million in cash, and

     *    An undetermined value for the service provider
franchises.

     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquire
all of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interest
in Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a global
communications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed out
that globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone service,
and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone.  

     If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr.
Schwartz predicted that the company would have three million
customers and $2.7 billion in annual revenues by the year 2002.

     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300
million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equity
from its initial public offering in February 1995 (TRI, March 3,
1995, p. 13), according to Globalstar's Mr. Ross.  Loral Space is
the largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public shareholders
as a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8% stake.  

     Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new bank
financing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional internal
financing--payments from exclusive service providers (the local
telephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute another $350
million over the next two to three years, Mr. Ross said.

     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million in
additional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said Globalstar would
try to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to Loral
Space and Globalstar's other investors for the funds.  

     Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering from
the market in October (TRI, Oct. 13, 1995, p. 12).  Mr. Kaimowitz
said this happened not because of a lack of investor interest, as
widely believed, but because Globalstar could get "debt at a
cheaper price" from the banks.

     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debt
provides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project in
very creative ways, with less need for traditional financing
methods."

     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and European
antitrust and other approvals, and it also requires at least
two-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.  

     Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz do not
expect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction, especially
since Loral's space business will remain a separate company.  Mr.
Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses Lockheed Martin is
acquiring from Loral have very little overlap with its existing
operations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for Lockheed Martin is
being led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank of America, and
Citicorp USA.

Satellite Services:
Comsat Plan To Merge Service Units Approved

     The FCC's International Bureau has approved Comsat Corp.'s
reorganization merging its Comsat Mobile Communications (CMC) unit
into its Comsat International Communications (CIC) unit (TRI,
August 4, 1995, p. 9).  Comsat Mobile handles Comsat's Inmarsat
signatory functions.  Comsat World Systems, which handles its
Intelsat signatory functions, already was part of CIC.  

     Under the reorganization, the World Systems and Mobile
Communications units will be housed in the same CIC division but
continue as separate units to conduct the separate Intelsat and
Inmarsat businesses, respectively.  

     Each line of business will have its own Vice President and
General Manager, who will report to CIC's President.  CIC also will
continue to hold Comsat International Ventures.

     Financial, legal, and human resources support services for the
Intelsat and Inmarsat units will be combined into CIC as part of
the reorganization.  U.S. signatory functions for both of the
international satellite organizations will be consolidated into a
single office, which will be headed by a Vice
President-international affairs.  

     In an order issued Jan. 16, the bureau said Comsat ensured
that a separate accounting system would guarantee that World
Systems and Mobile Communications ratepayers do not bear any
"nonjurisdictional" costs of the consolidated CIC unit.  

     The bureau found that the reorganization is consistent with
the public interest and the Commission's 1982 policy findings on
Comsat's corporate structure and operations.

     Addressing concerns raised by AT&T Corp., the bureau noted
that World Systems will not offer Intelsat earth station services. 


     AT&T also voiced concerns that ongoing Intelsat and Inmarsat
privatization efforts could lead to conflicts of interest for the
consolidated organization.  

     Comsat believes issues relating to privatization of the two
satellite organizations "clearly overlap" so that the same staff
"should be able to handle these issues, subject to appropriate cost
allocation procedures," the bureau noted.  

     It added that "internal conflicts are a normal part of any
large business enterprise" and stressed that the bureau has the
authority to review "any instance in which violations of Comsat's
statutory responsibilities and Commission policy may be alleged." 


     The bureau also addressed concerns raised by C-band maritime
satellite services provider MTN and separate international
satellite operator PanAmSat Corp.  

     MTN had argued that Comsat's provision of maritime C-band
service violates the Maritime Satellite Act and the FCC's
structural separation requirements.  The bureau said, "We see no
need to withhold action on Comsat's proposed reorganization pending
consideration in separate proceedings of MTN's contention that CMC
should not provide C-band maritime services over non-Inmarsat
facilities on an unseparated basis."

     While PanAmSat did not oppose the reorganization, it asked
that a partial waiver of the structural separation requirements
granted to CMC in 1993 not be granted to CWS for "value-added"
services that could be sold in conjunction with its fixed satellite
services.  PanAmSat also called for a "single comprehensive
proceeding" to consider Comsat's entire enterprise.  

     The bureau said it will consider the request for a
comprehensive review separately.  It noted that approval of
Comsat's reorganization "does not extend the partial waiver granted
to CMC to provide a discrete class of maritime services on an
unseparated basis."

Satellite Services:
Arianespace Needs More Rockets To Meet Demand

     Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expected
increased demand for launch services in the coming years, a company
spokeswoman said recently.  Arianespace recently unveiled plans to
order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch vehicles to meet the
growing demand.  

     It plans to establish its own finance company to help clients
fund satellite launches, the spokeswoman added.  Its insurance
unit, S3R, also will be reactivated to help market the Ariane 5,
the company's more powerful, next-generation rocket.

     Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches will
grow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  The
company plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70
satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans would
involve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. 
In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4
rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.

     The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergo
two technical verification flights in May and September of this
year, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially by
the end of the year if all goes well.  

     Meanwhile, fueling problems on the launch of Malaysia's first
national satellite, MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9
launch date.  The Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSat
Corp.'s PanAmSat 3R satellite.  The new launch date was set for
Jan. 12.

Intelsat Board To Consider Restructuring Plan This Year

     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have "a
better idea of the future structure" of the international satellite
consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-international
and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat Corp.  

     Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.
Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the board
took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  

     A special Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee"
of the board are exploring the future structure of the consortium,
he explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--
after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on the
board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the
"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.

     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers.  

     The board will review the support centers' performance at its
March 1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open any
additional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  

     Plans for improving customer service also include
restructuring Intelsat's sales and marketing division and
establishing new internal accounting processes, he added.

     The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A series
satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A satellites will
be deployed in February, and the last bird in the series will be
deployed later this year. 

      Work by Lockheed Martin Corp. on the VIII series of
satellites continues, and the board recently approved a "minor
modification" of the contract with Lockheed that "won't affect the
scheduled delivery," he added.

     The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805 satellite
to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While the current
design of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides sufficient land mass
coverage over all of Africa, intersystem coordination constraints
may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805 satellite at 33 degrees
East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained.  

     At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March
14-19, the board will consider releasing a request for proposals
for two new satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellites
covering the Indian Ocean region, he said.

Survey of the Americas:
Canadian Regulator Awards New DTH Satellite Licenses

     The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission has awarded licenses for two new Canadian direct-to-home
(DTH) satellite services and five DTH pay-per-view television
programming services.  

     The commission rejected a request from a consortium of cable
operators led by Shaw Communications, Inc., to operate a DTH
satellite distribution service.  It also rejected a proposal by
Power DirecTV to operate a French-language DTH pay-per-view
service.

     The two DTH satellite service licenses went to ExpressVu and
Power DirecTV.  BCE, Inc., and Tee-Comm Electronics, Inc., each own
33% of ExpressVu.  Canadian Satellite Communications, Inc., owns
19% of ExpressVu, and another 14% is owned by WIC Western
International Communications Ltd.  Power DirecTV is 80% owned by
Power Corp. of Canada and 20% owned by Hughes Aircraft Co. of
Canada.  

     That company, in turn, is owned by General Motors Corp.'s GM
Hughes Electronics Corp., which also owns U.S. satellite
broadcaster DirecTV, Inc.

     Licenses for four English-language DTH pay-per-view
programming services were awarded to providers of the
"Sports/Specials" and "Power DirecTicket" services, which will be
offered nationally, and to regional operators of the "Home Theatre"
and "Viewer's Choice" services serving western and eastern Canada,
respectively.

     A license for a French-language DTH pay-per-view service was
granted to Canal Premiere, allowing national distribution of
programming.

     The CRTC said it rejected the Shaw Communications group's
request to operate the "Homestar" DTH satellite service because it
"had significant concerns as to whether the Homestar proposal could
be implemented as proposed, in light of the uncertainty related to
the availability of authorized U.S. services via the Primestar
satellite."  

     The agency said it rejected Power DirecTV's request to operate
a French-language DTH pay-per-view service "because of the
commission's concern that this service would not meet the
objectives of the Broadcasting Act."

     The commission also outlined requirements for the DTH
licensees' provision of basic service and "fair and equitable
access" for programming services.  "In particular, the Commission's
policy requires DTH satellite distribution undertakings to maintain
a predominance of Canadian programming in the total packages they
make available to subscribers," CRTC said.  It will require DTH
distributors and pay-per-view services to contribute 5% of their
annual gross revenues toward the production of Canadian
programming.  

     CRTC said it will not regulate the DTH licensees' rates,
reasoning that "competition between the two new DTH satellite
services, the cable industry, and other distribution technologies
will create sufficient market pressure to discipline rates charged
to subscribers."

Canada Reverses Order Cutting Long Distance Rates

     Industry Canada (the country's industry ministry) has
overturned, in part, a recent decision by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission requiring
telecom carriers to reduce basic long distance rates.  

     Seven regional telephone companies had asked the government to
reverse the CRTC's decision, which also required them to raise
monthly local rates by $2 (Canadian) on Jan. 1, 1996, and Jan. 1,
1997.  Long distance rates were to be lowered by the same amount. 
The telcos had argued that CRTC's order was an "unwarranted
interference with market forces," the ministry said.  The local
rate increases will go into effect as ordered, it added.

     Industry Minister John Manley said in a statement that the
government took action "to ensure more investment and sustainable
competition in the telecommunications industry. . .The government
believes this decision will help the industry achieve a greater
stability in the marketplace and increase their investment in R&D." 


     Mr. Manley explained that the Canadian industry's rate of
return on equity is about one-third lower than that of U.S.
companies.  As a result, "Canadian companies do not have the same
resources to invest in research and development and for capital
expenditures."

Brazilian Telecom Reform Bill Heads to Legislature

     Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has signed a
draft telecommunications reform bill and presented it to Brazil's
Congress, according to a government official.  The measure would
permit foreign investors to purchase up to 49% ownership stakes in
Brazilian satellites and cellular telephone service providers.  

     If enacted, the legislation could lead to a tripling of
standard telephone lines to 40 million and could increase the
number of cellular phone lines from 800,000 to 17.2 million over
the next eight years, the official said.  The measure also would
address cable TV regulation.

     Over the next three years the Brazilian government wants to
consolidate the nearly two dozen regional phone companies--one for
each Brazilian state--into a "smaller number like five, six, or
seven," the official said.  

     Consolidation could lead to privatization, although ownership
likely would remain in Brazilian hands, the official added.  

     If foreign companies are allowed to invest in Brazil's
telephone companies, the government may require them to develop
research programs to spur technological development in Brazil.

AT&T Opposes 'Full Circuit' Plan of Telecom New Zealand 

     AT&T Corp. has opposed a motion by Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Ameritech Corp. seeking permission from the U.S. District Court in
Washington for Telecom Corp. of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide the
U.S. "half" of international services between New Zealand and the
U.S.  

     TCNZ, in which Bell Atlantic and Ameritech own 24.82% stakes,
currently is permitted under a 1990 waiver of the AT&T antitrust
consent decree to provide the foreign half of those services.  It
is seeking permission to establish an interconnection point on the
U.S. West Coast to transport international calls originating or
terminating in the U.S.  Then it would hand off calls to U.S.
interexchange carriers (IXCs).

     TCNZ wants to compete with MCI Telecommunications Corp. and
Sprint International, which provide a full circuit between the U.S.
and New Zealand through their affiliates.  

     A full circuit would allow TCNZ "to compete more vigorously in
the market for calls from New Zealand and would allow it to offer
American [IXCs] an additional, low-cost choice for the transport of
outbound international calls," Bell Atlantic and Ameritech said
late last year in their joint motion.

     In its recent response, AT&T told the court that the proposed
waiver modification would enable TCNZ, Bell Atlantic, and Ameritech
"to impose even greater costs on U.S. carriers" and to gain a
competitive advantage "illicitly."  If the Bell companies were
"genuinely concerned about the consumer harms that result from
inflated accounting rates, they would agree to reduce the current
accounting rate on calls between the U.S. and New Zealand," AT&T
said.  

     Granting the motion would allow TCNZ to preserve inflated
accounting rates and permit Bell Atlantic and Ameritech to use
their operating companies' local exchange service monopolies to
hinder competition and harm customers in the U.S.

     In transmitting calls originating in New Zealand over full
circuit "private lines" to the U.S., "TCNZ would avoid its duty to
return to each U.S. IXC a proportionate share of the traffic [the
IXC] sends to TCNZ," AT&T argued.  

     "That, in turn, would exacerbate the settlement deficits of
these U.S. carriers--and increase the surplus of TCNZ--by denying
U.S. carriers the return traffic on which they would earn payments
from TCNZ."  

     AT&T estimated that if the motion were granted, net payments
from U.S. carriers to TCNZ would increase by 75%--even if only 30%
of TCNZ's traffic were carried over full circuits.

Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses

     With the third auction of personal communications service
(PCS) licenses getting started in the U.S., Industry Canada has
announced that it awarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  

     Clearnet Communications, Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and
MicroCell Network, Inc., of Montreal, each were awarded 30
megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers Cantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility
Personacom Canada Ltd., were awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  

     Industry Minister John Manley said the four new licensees will
invest more than $3 billion to develop their PCS systems.  He
estimated that 8,500 new jobs will be created over the next five
years as the PCS market develops.

     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses to
noncellular companies will create a sound industry structure, which
should facilitate the development of enhanced competition and
innovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.
Simmonds.  

     Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile radio
networks for businesses in major metro areas.  Nextel
Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholders
in Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with its
PCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in two
Canadians is interested in using PCS.

     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is a
start-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group of
Canadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors in
MicroCell.  

     Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular service providers
in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand its current
service offerings.  And based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility
Personacom is an affiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian
cellular carrier.  

     Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member
companies" are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial
landline telephone companies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will
operate their systems on the same frequencies as their counterparts
in the U.S.--between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.

DBS Permits Extended for EchoStar, Directsat, DBSC 

     The FCC's International Bureau has extended the period during
which EchoStar Satellite Corp. and Directsat Corp. may construct,
launch, and operate direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems.  

     In an order signed Dec. 21 by Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris,
the bureau gave EchoStar until Aug. 15, 1996, to begin operating a
DBS satellite at its eastern orbital location.  In a separate
order, the bureau gave Direct Broadcasting Satellite Corp. (DBSC)
until Nov. 30, 1998, to construct a DBS system.

     To date, DBSC has paid 2.9%, or $2 million, of the total
satellite contract price, and it is slated to pay 27.2% of the
contract price on Dec. 29.  DBSC also has moved up the schedule for
delivery of its first and second satellites to July 1997 and July
1998, respectively, from September 1998 and March 1999.  

     "Extending DBSC's permit until 1998 will allow sufficient time
for construction of both of its satellites under its modified
construction contract," the bureau said.  "Because we grant this
extension based in large measure upon DBSC's expedited construction
schedule, we will condition the grant upon DBSC's remaining in
substantial compliance with that schedule."

     The bureau deferred ruling on EchoStar's request for a
four-year extension to begin DBS operations from its western
orbital slot.  The recent partial U.S. government shutdown
prevented the bureau from reviewing that request.  

     A ruling will be made when the bureau has had time "to make a
due diligence determination," it said.  Mr. Harris was among the
few FCC employees permitted to work during the partial shutdown.

     On Dec. 28, 1995, EchoStar successfully launched its
"USABSS-3" satellite--part of its planned DBS system.  The
satellite will be positioned in EchoStar's assigned eastern orbital
location at 119.2 degrees West Longitude, and the company plans to
start transmitting in early 1996, the order notes.  

     The bureau also granted EchoStar authority to use in-orbit,
fixed-satellite service C-band (4-6 gigahertz) frequencies for all
telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) functions on the space
station.  TT&C functions are needed for general orbital maneuvers
and spacecraft control operations.  EchoStar had planned to use
Ku-band frequencies for TT&C functions but sought authority to use
C-band frequencies instead, citing lower costs.

     Directsat--which was merged into EchoStar Satellite's parent
company, EchoStar Communications Corp., in 1995 (TRI, Jan. 20,
1995, p. 11)--is scheduled to operate its system on a "companion
basis" with EchoStar's DBS system, the order states.  With the
extension, Directsat now has until Aug. 15, 1999, to begin
operating its DBS system at both of its orbital locations. 
Directsat plans to launch its first DBS satellite into the 119
degrees W.L. orbital location this summer, the order says.  

     It has asked the bureau for permission to modify its DBS
license application to permit TT&C operations in frequency bands
currently allocated for government use.  

     The bureau said that request is under consideration "pending
completion of coordination with government users of that spectrum."

Ameritech VDT Plans Grow Dimmer; Applications Pulled

     Ameritech Corp. has hammered another nail into the coffin of
its video dial-tone (VDT) plans, formally withdrawing five
applications for Communications Act section 214 authority to offer
commercial VDT service.  

     Ameritech officials said the decision to withdraw the
applications, which were approved a year ago by the FCC's Common
Carrier Bureau was prompted by the agency's delay in adopting final
VDT rules.  

     Commission officials have said they will address VDT issues
after Congress completes action on pending telecommunications
legislation.

     While forging ahead with plans to deploy stand-alone cable TV
systems over the past few months, Ameritech officials have hinted
that they might abandon their VDT plans.  

     Approval of the VDT applications had permitted Ameritech to
offer common carrier video service in parts of Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

     At a recent press briefing in Washington, Richard C.
Notebaert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ameritech, told
TRI that the company might consider resubmitting the section 214
applications if it is satisfied with future FCC actions in the
pending docket 87-266 VDT proceeding.  He said Ameritech was
bullish about VDT until the FCC began exploring the idea of
regulating telco providers of video services using a hybrid
regulatory structure drawn from both Title VI (cable TV) and Title
II (common carrier) of the Act.

Sprint Sets Alliance Vote After Receiving FCC OK

     Sprint Corp. has postponed a shareholder vote on measures
related to the proposed Phoenix global alliance but said it expects
to close the transaction--including an investment of more than $4
billion  by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG--by the end of
this month.  

     A meeting for shareholders to approve the investment agreement
and related charter and bylaws changes technically was scheduled to
begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Then it will adjourn temporarily until Jan.
29, when the Phoenix deal will be considered, a Sprint spokesman
explained.  The "adjournment" will not change the Nov. 13, 1995,
record date for shareholders to be eligible to vote at the meeting,
the spokesman noted.

     The postponement stemmed from long lead-time scheduling of the
proxy distribution and the meeting, which were linked to expected
FCC action to approve the deal, the spokesman said.  When the FCC
acted a week later than had been expected, "some things were pushed
back" in closing procedures, he said.  

     Sprint said the price France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom will
pay for new class A Sprint stock will be $48.704 per share.  That
was the maximum price possible under a formula pegged to the
closing price of Sprint common stock during a 20-day trading period
ending 15 trading days before closing of the transaction.

     During its regular meeting Dec. 15, the FCC granted Sprint's
request for a declaratory ruling that the combined 20% investment
by the European carriers would not conflict with Communications Act
section 310(b)(4) restrictions on foreign ownership of common
carrier radio licensees.  

     Presenting the recommendations to the Commissioners, staffer
Kerry E. Murray said the bureau found that France Telecom's and
Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of 20% of Sprint for as much as $4.2
billion would not constitute a transfer of control of Sprint.  

     The bureau found that the transaction would be in the public
interest, subject to several conditions described by Ms. Murray and
International Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris as "strict."

     Ms. Murray said the bureau found that France and Germany do
not offer "effective competitive opportunities" under the
Commission's recently adopted standard for analyzing foreign
companies' requests to enter U.S. telecom markets (TRI, Dec. 8,
1995, p. 1).  

     But she cited "two important countervailing public interest
factors" for approving the proposed venture.  "Both France and
Germany have begun to implement wide-ranging liberalization plans,
including the introduction of full telecommunications competition
on Jan. 1, 1998," she noted.  The investment by France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom "will enable Sprint to become a more potent
competitor in a wide range of U.S. markets," she added.

     Mr. Harris stated more than once the bureau's conclusion that
the Phoenix alliance will give both Sprint and its French and
German partners short-term competitive advantages in the U.S.,
French, and German markets that will not be available to other U.S.
international carriers.  

     But the conditions imposed by the Commission would mediate
that advantage over the near term and eliminate it by the time the
European Union implements full telecom liberalization on Jan. 1,
1998, he said.

     As explained by Ms. Murray, the conditions are required to
"address the potential for France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to
engage in anticompetitive conduct and the possibility that the
telecommunications liberalization anticipated in France and Germany
may not be fully implemented on schedule."  She said the bureau
recommended making a public interest finding favoring the Sprint
venture under the following conditions:

     (1) Sprint is regulated as a dominant carrier on the French
and German routes;

     (2) Sprint is not allowed "to increase the number of circuits
it operates on the French and German routes until these countries
allow the use of alternative infrastructure [i.e., private networks
operated by utility companies, railroads, etc.] to provide already
liberalized services, and France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom make
available basic switched voice resale";

     (3) Sprint complies with specified nondiscrimination and
reporting requirements;

     (4) "France Telecom commits to lowering its accounting rate
with the U.S. to that of the United Kingdom and Germany within two
years"; and

     (5)"Sprint reports to this Commission in 1998 whether the
anticipated liberalization occurred in France and Germany.  If it
has not, the Commission will take further action, including
designating for hearing whether certain of Sprint's facilities
authorizations should be revoked."

     Asked about the circuit activation restriction, Mr. Harris
explained to Chairman Reed E. Hundt that beginning with the close
of the joint venture transaction, "all three [carriers] can offer
things to large customers that, in essence, nobody else can."  

     He cited single-party billing, billing in a single currency,
and one-stop problem resolution.  The bureau staff believes that
constitutes an "unfair competitive advantage," he said.  

     The circuit activation restriction, therefore, was imposed as
an inducement for the French and German carriers to allow other
U.S. carriers to provide resale services in their home markets.  

     Mr. Harris said French and German government authorities "have
said it's OK" if the carriers agree to permit resale.  Implementing
that policy would enable other U.S. carriers to develop business
relationships with end-user customers before the widespread EU
liberalization in 1998, he added.  

     Similarly, the restriction should provide an incentive for
France and Germany to stick to the July 1996 timetable agreed to in
negotiations with Mr. van Miert to permit competitive carriers to
access alternative infrastructure networks and to roll out services
that already are liberalized in the French and German markets, Mr.
Harris said.  

     That will enable other U.S. carriers to use networks other
than those of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, and thus avoid
benefitting their competitors in those markets.  "The alternative
would have been simply to walk away from the problem for two years,
and two years is a very long time," he added.

     A DT spokesman told TRI after the Commission meeting that the
requirement that DT open the German market to switched voice resale
could be problematic.  "The question is whether they mean simple
'rebilling' or genuine resale," he noted.  

     He explained that although resale of services to "closed user
groups" such as corporate private networks is permitted in Germany,
"if it's real resale outside of corporate users, it's still a
reserved monopoly service until 1998."   The resale requirement was
one of several outlined by the FCC that may not "reflect the actual
situation in Germany," he said.

     Briefing reporters, Mr. Harris said the inducement for France
and Germany to stick to their alternative infrastructure
liberalization deadline of July 1996--and for the French and German
carriers to enter into agreements with other U.S. carriers to
provide public voice resale--will be the circuit activation
restriction on Sprint.  

     He clarified that the restriction will not apply to Sprint's
acquisition of new circuits but rather to its activation and
operation of new circuits on the French and German routes.

     Asked how the restrictions differ from anticompetitive
safeguards sought by the Justice Department in a proposed antitrust
consent decree to allow the Phoenix venture to go forward (TRI,
July 21, 1995, p. 1), Mr. Harris said, "The two overlap at the
edges," differing largely because the responsibilities of DoJ and
the Commission are different.  While Justice oversees antitrust
law, the Commission's statutory mandate to make public interest
findings enables it to "push for additional conditions" to ensure
greater competition, Mr. Harris said.  

     Both the FCC decision and the consent decree require that
Sprint obtain no special concessions and receive nondiscriminatory
treatment vis-a-vis other U.S. international carriers, he said.  

     But the circuit activation restriction, the imposition of
dominant carrier regulation, and the requirement that the Phoenix
alliance meet the Commission's new "effective competitive
opportunities" test for foreign market entry are unique to the FCC
decision, he explained.

     In an introductory statement at the meeting, Mr. Harris noted
that "several weeks ago, this Commission adopted new rules
governing the entry of foreign carriers into the U.S. market.  

     "We said then that the new rules would both open our market to
more competition and create powerful incentives to open foreign
markets to competition. . .This is the first opportunity we have to
apply those rules, and it may be the most important such
opportunity we have for a long time to come."  

     He said the strict conditions proposed for an order approving
Phoenix constituted a recognition that "France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom are still monopolists operating in closed markets."

     Asked by Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett whether there is a
risk that the FCC may have to back-pedal on the decision if France
and Germany do not stick to their liberalization timetables, Mr.
Harris responded, "We do not offer you certainty, but this is our
best judgment of where we think these things are going."  

     If the French and German market-opening commitments are not
met, the FCC might decide in 1998 to "pull" Sprint's Communications
Act section 214 facilities authorizations on the French and German
routes, he said.  

     That would adversely affect Sprint, but the test before the
FCC is the impact  on "the U.S. public, consumers, and industry--
not just one corporation," Mr. Harris said.  "Keep in mind that
Sprint is getting $4 billion and is entering a relationship with
two monopolists.    The key to approving this transaction today is
that those monopolists today will not be monopolists for all time,"
he said.

U.S. Regulatory Scene:
PanAmSat Seeks Satellite Licensing Policy Changes

     PanAmSat Corp. has urged the FCC to prevent the "hardening of
the competitive arteries" in the domestic fixed C- and Ku-band
satellite industry by limiting the number of orbital resources a
single company may control.  

     That would "reinvigorate" the Commission's policy of allowing
competitive entry into the domestic fixed satellite market,
PanAmSat said.  It outlined its proposal in comments it planned to
file once the FCC reopened after the heavy snowfall that struck
Washington recently. 

     Specifically, PanAmSat proposed three steps the FCC should
take "to correct the imbalance in competitive opportunities between
existing operators and new entrants" in the domestic satellite
industry.  It suggested the following:

     (1)  Limiting to five the number of domestic arc orbital
locations that any one entity or its affiliates may control; 

     (2)  Making the domestic-system financial qualifications
consistent with those currently in place for separate international
satellite systems; and 

     (3)  Imposing strict requirements, at both the beginning and
end of a satellite's life, to prevent the "warehousing" of orbital
locations.

     PanAmSat said the domestic satellite industry is dominated by
three major players:  Hughes Communications, Inc., GE American
Communications, and AT&T Corp.  

     Those players collectively control about 23 of the 31 domestic
orbital arcs, it told the FCC.  As a result, it added, there is a
"severe shortage" of domestic C- and Ku-band capacity, which in
turn has led to "sharply increased rates" for capacity.  

     PanAmSat asserted that the FCC's own satellite replacement,
system expansion, and financial qualification policies have
"exacerbated" the scarcity of domestic arc resources.

     The FCC's satellite replacement policy generally allows
companies to launch a replacement satellite into the same location
as a previous one, PanAmSat noted.  

     Operators also are permitted to expand existing satellite
systems by acquiring additional orbital slots.  

     "The replacement and expansion policies, in tandem. . .have
allowed existing operators to lock up the vast majority of domestic
arc orbital positions, and in turn, block the competitive entries
of newcomers," PanAmSat said.  

     "The replacement policy effectively has given incumbents
squatter's rights to their long-held orbital positions, [making] it
virtually impossible to dislodge existing operators from the
locations already under their control."

     PanAmSat called the FCC's domestic "financial showing"
standard--which requires operators to produce a current balance
sheet showing sufficient assets to sustain a multimillion-dollar
project--an "insurmountable barrier to entry to smaller companies." 


     Application of the two-step separate international satellite
system financial qualification standard will "encourage the
development of a vibrant separate satellite system industry without
burdening the Commission with laggards or speculators," the company
maintained.

     Noting that the FCC had imposed limits on direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) orbital slots, PanAmSat said similar limits should
be imposed on the number of domestic orbital arcs controlled by one
entity.  

     Setting a limit of five slots would "strike the proper balance
between preserving the Commission's long-standing competitive entry
policies and rewarding existing operators for the substantial
financial risks and significant investments associated with the
establishment and operation of existing satellite networks," it
told the FCC.

     To prevent warehousing of orbital slots, PanAmSat suggested
that the Commission require all satellite applicants to meet "clear
construction and operational milestones."  

     Construction permits for satellites should be awarded on a
conditional basis, subject to cancellation if entities do not meet
such milestones, it said.  A permittee would become a licensee only
if it successfully followed its prescribed timetable.  

     Also, when a satellite nears the end of its useful life, the
Commission should examine whether the traffic it is carrying could
be consolidated with traffic carried by other satellites owned by
the same operator, PanAmSat said.

Telecom Ministry Hints At Delay on Fate of NTT 

     TOKYO--The new head of Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications Ichiro Hino has said in interviews following his
appointment that a final decision on the issue of a Nippon
Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) breakup may be postponed.  

     Mr. Hino expressed concern that rushing to a decision on an
issue of such strategic importance without a national consensus
would not be the right approach.  Industry sources interpreted Mr.
Hino's comments as a move by the ruling coalition members, Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party and Socialist Party, to offset efforts by
ministry bureaucrats to force a decision within this fiscal year. 


     The end result may be that the politicians gain the upper hand
and delay significant revisions to Japan's telecommunications
industry as they did five years ago when the NTT breakup issue was
first broached and then shelved until 1995.

NTT To Seek 20% Cuts In Long Distance Rates

     TOKYO--Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) President
Masashi Kojima has announced that the company plans to ask the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for permission to reduce
long distance call rates.  The cuts would apply to calls over
distances of 160 kilometers by 30 to 40 yen, a cut of almost 20%. 


     At the same time, Mr. Kojima repeated the company's strong
resistance to efforts by the ministry and NTT's new common carrier
competitors to break up the telecom giant.  

     He pointed to the results of NTT's open network policy as an
indication that there is no need to dismantle a nationwide
infrastructure built up over the past century.

     Specifically, he highlighted the scheduled connection of Tokyo
Telecommunications Network (TTNet)--NTT's local loop rival in the
Tokyo metropolitan area--to NTT's subscriber network this month and
the agreements expected to be reached with cable TV telephony
providers in February for similar network connections.

     Mr. Kojima also stressed the benefits of concentrating
research and development efforts in a single organization.

Japan Telecom Survey:
Personal Handyphone Use Expected To Lag Forecasts 

     TOKYO--Despite recruiting almost 620,000 subscribers in the
first six months after starting service, Japan's personal
handyphone service (PHS) providers are playing catch-up with their
initial subscriber forecasts.  

     Expectations of hitting the 2-million subscriber mark by the
end of fiscal year 1995 in March 1996 likely will be dashed. 
Observers believe the actual figure could be as little as half that
number. 

     At the current pace of 130,000 new subscribers a month, PHS
providers will just top the 1 million level within the fiscal 1995
time frame.  The below forecast results can be attributed to quick
steps taken by conventional cellular phone competitors to bring
their prices down in order to keep customers away from the cheaper,
newer PHS service.  

     In the past year, cellular providers have reduced initial
sign-up fees and usage rates significantly.  They also switched to
a system of open sale of handheld phone units, rather than leasing
them in a bundled package with cellular service.

     One trend is apparent in the PHS market--Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp.'s (NTT's) grip on the telecommunications market is
weakening.  

     In December 1995 NTT Personal Communications Network companies
signed up just 30,600 new subscribers, compared with 52,400 for the
competing DDI Pocket Phone group companies and 51,300 for the Astel
group companies.

     The NTT Personal group hopes to stem this slide in market
share by slashing its rates.  In a recent application to the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the group indicated that
it will cut the usage rate for calls in the 20- to 30-kilometer
range from 100 yen to 50 yen.  For calls in the 30- to 60-kilometer
range, it proposed to cut the rate from 140 yen to 60 yen.  

     In both categories, the adjustments would make NTT Personal's
rates comparable or as much as 25% lower than its rivals.  While
the DDI Corp.'s Pocket and Astel groups are expected to respond
with their own rate cuts, continuing capital requirements for
network expansion could delay their response. 

     The DDI Pocket group, however, has developed a PHS base
station with its partner companies Kyocera, Kyushu Matsushita
Electric, and Nittsuko that will reduce its investment costs by
one-third its per-station costs.  

     The cost-effective base station should reduce DDI Pocket's
per-station cost and enable it to speed up its network expansion.

France Telecom Chairman Outlines Reorganization Plan 

     France Telecom Chairman Michel Bon recently disclosed a plan
to reorganize the state-owned telecommunications giant around five
branches and outlined a strategy to prepare for competition in the
European telecom market beginning in 1998.  

     Speaking at a company meeting in Paris Dec. 20, Mr. Bon said
the plan emphasizes the need to improve customer services and
increase demand for France Telecom's offerings.  It was devised
after Mr. Bon spent three months in the field, talking with more
than 1,000 employees to understand France Telecom's operations
better. 

     French consumers use their telephone lines an average of eight
minutes per day, while U.S. consumers spend about 20 minutes daily
on the telephone, Mr. Bon pointed out.  He said France Telecom must
increase its 3% annual growth rate to a level approaching AT&T
Corp.'s 9% growth rate.  At that growth level, France Telecom's
traffic would increase from 120 billion minutes annually to 170
billion minutes by the year 2000.  "This objective is realistic and
attainable," Mr. Bon said.  

     The additional traffic is expected to come from increases in
mobile telephony use, "improving the flow and efficiency of
traffic," and "encouraging new uses for telephones," such as
personal computer applications, he explained.

     The plan envisions reorganizing France Telecom around three
operational branches and two functional branches.  The operational
areas would include consumer services, corporate services, and
network services, and the functional branches would include
"development" and "resources."  

     An executive committee will be formed, composed of the
President of France Telecom and the company's five Branch
Directors.  The panel's purpose is "to synthesize and coordinate"
France Telecom's operations, with decisions being made "as close as
possible to the field within each branch," Mr. Bon said.  A
"detailed implementation plan" for the reorganization will be
announced "in the next few weeks," he added.

Ericsson, Ascom Joint Venture Clears EC Competition Hurdle

     The European Competition Commission has decided not to oppose
a wireless communications joint venture between Ericsson, Inc., of
Sweden and Ascom of Switzerland.  

     The companies proposed in late November to establish the
venture through Ascom's Swedish subsidiary, Ascom Tateco.  The
venture will develop, manufacture, and install on-site paging
systems and equipment in markets where both parent companies have
been active, the commission noted.

     The commission's review of the on-site paging market found
that the joint venture will be faced with "sufficient competition.
 . .from the present players, which are either strong multinational
companies such as Philips [Electronics NV], Bosch [GmbH], and
Motorola, [Inc.] or are companies specialized in on-site paging,
such as Multitone."  

     The commission said the market is composed of "large
sophisticated customers. . .who are in a position to exercise
significant bargaining power and who frequently use calls for
tenders to award contracts."

EU Telecom Survey:
Mobile Services Directive Formally Approved by EC 

     The European Commission has formally adopted the Article 90
directive (TRI, July 7, 1995, p. 6), opening European Union mobile
and personal communications markets to full competition.  It is
based on comments to a "green paper" on mobile and personal
communications issued in 1994 (TRI, May 13, 1994, p. 1).  

     The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive
and special rights for mobile communications.  It establishes "open
and fair licensing procedures" to authorize the launch of digital
services GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), DCS 1800
(the two frequencies available for digital mobile services), and
DECT (for digital cordless telephony within a fixed radius).  

     The directive requires states to lift restrictions on current
licensees for one of these frequencies from applying to extend
their services into the others.  It prohibits member states of the
European Union from restricting the combination of mobile
technologies or systems, specifically where multistandard equipment
is available.

     Existing restrictions on the use of mobile network facilities
will be lifted, the EC said, "allowing new mobile operators to make
full use of their own infrastructure as well as that provided by
third parties such as utilities' networks."

     The EC said the directive will become effective 20 days after
publication in the Official Journal of the EC, which is expected by
the end of January.  

     Member states then have nine months to notify the commission
of the appropriate national measures taken to implement the
directive's provisions.  

     Under Article 90, the commission can adopt directives under
its own authority without submitting them for approval by the
ministers and Parliament.

EU Telecom Survey:
EC Expected To Approve Atlas, Phoenix Ventures

     BRUSSELS--The European Commission has said it will approve the
Atlas alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG and
their Phoenix global services alliance with Sprint Corp.  

     While stating its intent to approve the two ventures, the
commission is seeking comments on the deals by the end of January. 


     It recently released details of the two deals and outlined
certain changes made following its intervention. 

     One change for the Phoenix alliance requires Deutsche Telekom,
France Telecom, Atlas, and Sprint to delete France Telecom's and
Deutsche Telekom's international half-circuits from the list of
products that Phoenix would distribute as an agent.  

     The companies also are prohibited from either competing with
or investing in long distance service providers unless they are
controlled by Phoenix.  The commission prohibited Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom from discriminating in favor of the Phoenix
entities.  

     For the Atlas venture, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom
have agreed to the following changes:  not to appoint Atlas SA as
an agent for international half-circuits; not to integrate French
and German data networks before full liberalization of the
telecommunications infrastructure and services market; and not to
integrate France Telecom's German corporate telecom service
provider, Info AG, into Atlas.  They agreed Info AG must be
divested.  

     In addition Atlas will not be granted terms or conditions that
would enable it to offer services its competitors are prevented
from offering, the commission said. 

     France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are prohibited from
engaging in cross-subsidization.  They have agreed to establish and
maintain third-party access to their public switched data networks
in France and Germany.

     While the commission is unlikely to reverse its decision to
grant approval to both ventures, it is expected that a number of
national telecom operators will file complaints with the
Competition Directorate.

EU Telecom Survey:
EU 'Information Society' To Proceed Despite Doubts

     Some Europeans want to "stop the clock" before proceeding with
telecommunications sector reforms, but engaging in further debate
over whether Europe should develop a new "information society" is
not an option, a senior European official has said.  

     Steven Micossi, the European Commission Director General for
Industry, said at a recent conference that "all basic decisions
have now been taken by the commission" for the telecom sector.  Mr.
Micossi's remarks were made during the annual European Information
Technologies Conference (EITC) held in Brussels.

     "Some member states need to be convinced that privatization
[in] the industry will be beneficial," he acknowledged.  "At any
rate, by January 1998 there will be a de facto open market for the
telecom industry in Europe, where open competition will be able to
develop," Mr. Micossi added.  

     Organized by the commission's Directorate General for
Industry, the EITC conference explored social and cultural issues
raised by the ongoing evolution of European information
technologies.  The conference also highlighted the European Union's
"Esprit" communications research and development program.

     Speaking to reporters after the conference, Martin Bangemann,
Commissioner for Industrial Affairs, Information, and
Telecommunications Technologies, outlined initiatives the European
Union has begun to ensure that Europe is prepared for the evolving
information society.  

     He said significant progress has been made on the first
initiative--to deregulate EU telecom markets.  He emphasized
commitments by France and Germany to liberate alternative
infrastructure markets by July 1, 1996.

     To accomplish goals for deregulation, legislation must be in
place addressing intellectual property rights, data protection, and
competition, Commissioner Bangemann said.  Outdated laws, based on
older technologies, must be modified.  

     He stated that mergers between companies in different sectors
of the communications industry sometimes may be necessary to
strengthen the telecom sector of the EU's economy.  

     Several pilot projects initiated as a result of the G7
ministerial conference earlier this year will spur the development
of information technologies and will make Europeans aware of some
of the practical applications of those technologies, he said.

     Asked about the need to establish an independent EU telecom
authority, Mr. Bangemann said it would be unwise to put the issue
on the agenda for the EU Inter-Governmental Conference slated for
next year.  The issue is highly sensitive and should be examined
carefully before a proposal is presented to Europe's political
leaders, he said.

     In a speech during the conference, Michael Spindler, President
and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Computer, Inc., compared the
current information technologies revolution to the sixth century
"knowledge explosion which resulted from the definition of the
alphabet and mathematics."  

     The current technology revolution will have dramatic economic
impact, he said, citing projections that the U.S. information
industry will amount to $1 trillion by the year 2000 and $1.5
trillion by 2005.  

     Although computer hardware and software will constitute the
largest markets, communications and content development markets
will be important as well, Mr. Spindler predicted.

     Cable & Wireless plc of the United Kingdom had a good year. 
Its share price rose 84 points or 22.34% in 1995 to close at 460
pence.  

     The company decided on a marketing change for 1996,
substituting the "federation" label for "group."  It said the
change is being made because of confusion surrounding the
federation label, which was used in an attempt to describe the
company's operations in 50 countries.

     Bucking the global trend of price appreciation, Northern
Telecom Ltd. of Canada's share price slipped 4.50 points or 19.25%
before closing at $18.88 (Canadian).  

     The company aligned with Cabletron Systems, Inc., to develop
and market integrated communications and network products.  

     Northern Telecom also said it is near a final agreement worth
more than $150 million over five years with NYNEX for the
distribution and installation of ISDN (integrated services digital
network) hardware and software.

     The company argued that the FCC has failed to consider steps
to encourage small business participation in the auction.  The
Appeals Court is expected to rule on the request before Jan. 19,
the date specified by the FCC for auction participants to submit
"up-front" payments.
