Antarctic digital database user's guide and reference manual.  BAS,
SPRI and WCMC (compilers), 1993.  Cambridge, Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research, xi + 156 pp.  [This manual accompanies a CD-ROM.]
ISBN 0 948277 16 5

<P>

The Antarctic Digital Database (ADD) represents a major development in
Antarctic mapping, providing access to the first seamleAntarctic
mapping, providing access to the first seamless digital map of
Antarctica.  This CD carries the most up-to-date and complete
coastline of the continent in digital form.

<P>

The ADD can be used to:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Generate customized maps for scientific, operational and
educational purposes;

<P>

<LI>Provide the topographic framework for a variety of GIS applications;

<P>

<LI>Facilitate international collaboration by providing a common base
for recording or analysing spatial data.

</UL>

<P>

The ADD, covering the area south of latitude 60=B0 South, has been prepared
in the United Kingdom by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), the Scott
Polar Research Institute (SPRI) and the World Conservation Monitoring
Centre (WCMC) under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research (SCAR) and its Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic
Information.  The database has been compiled from cartographic material
published by eleven nations (Argentina, Australia, China, Germany, Japan,
New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, United Kingdom and United States of
America).  The scale of the source material used has ranged from 1:200,000
to 1:5,000,000, and the coastline has been up-dated by reference to
satellite imagery at 1:1,000,000 scale.

<P>

The Antarctic digital topographic database is provided on one compact disc
(CD-ROM), and is accessible through PC ArcViewTM, PC ARC/INFO=AE and PC
ArcCADTM.  It is formatted for MS-DOS systems only.  The database can be
used either directly from the CD or it can be down-loaded on to PCs.  The
CD includes several preconstructed views intended for display with ArcView.
These views can be used as a tutorial to introduce the user to the
database and to illustrate its potential.

<P>

The Antarctic Digital Database User's Guide and Reference Manual which
accompanies the CD provides detailed information on the content of the
database, its coverages and attributes, and includes lists of all approved
Antarctic conservation areas and active scientific stations.  It also
contains a detailed bibliography of the source material used in the
preparation of the ADD.
