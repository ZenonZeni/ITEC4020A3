<h2 align=center>Position Statement on<br>
Committee Recommendations to Amend the<br>
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act<br>(IDEA)</h2>

<p>June 9, 1996

<p>LDA appreciates the important efforts that have been undertaken in both
the House and Senate to develop legislation designed to improve the IDEA.
Both House and the Senate Committees propose numerous changes in the Act
that LDA feels are important and positive.  Following are several of the
provisions LDA supports:

<ol>

<li>Changes related to the IEP, including:

<dl>
<p>A. Participation of parents in eligibility and placement decisions and
regular and special education teachers, where appropriate, in the IEP
team.

<p>B. Inclusion of short term goals or other benchmarks to measure
progress.

<p>C. Requirement for objective measurements of the child's progress
towards attaining annual goals.

<p>D. Inclusion of required accommodations. 

<p>E. Consideration of the emotional and behavioral aspects of a child's
learning disability as well as the communication needs of the child.

<p>F. The addition of the child's teacher to those who may reconvene the
IEP team to consider additional strategies for working with a child with
behavioral problems. 

<p>G. The requirement that the IEP team consider the appropriateness and
implementation of the child's IEP before a change in placement. 

<p>H. Reevaluations focused on the child's continued need for special
education and related services, not on whether or not the child has a
disability.
</dl>

<li>The retention of the current disability categories and the expansion of
the use of the term "developmental delay" for children aged 3 to  9.
Participation of children with disabilities in standardized assessments,
with accommodations if necessary.<br>

<li>Dropping the age for the beginning of transition considerations to age
14.<br>

<li>The requirement that parents be offered pre-due process mediation and
providing that either party can withdraw after a good faith effort has
been made.<br>

<li>The removal of the waiver provisions for model LEA programs and under 
Part H.

</ol>

<p>At the same time, LDA has concerns about other provisions within these
bills including:

<ol>

<li>Consolidation of  discretionary programs without adequate assurance
that the mission of these important programs will continue and that the
overall authorization level will be maintained.<br>

<li>  Changes in incidental benefit requirements and establishment of  a
coordinated services system which allows IDEA funds to be used for
students without disabilities.<br>

<li>Any new law that might result in coercion of  parents to "voluntarily" 
use their private insurance to pay for related services.

</ol>

<p>Finally, LDA is not prepared to support legislation which includes
provisions that would:

<ol>
<li>Alter state and local funding formulas to move away from the current child
count provision.<br>

<li>Allow state education agencies to suspend highest professional standards
for special education teachers and related services providers.<br>

<li>Allow a local education agency to reduce the level of expenditures for
special education when the reduction is attributable to the departure, by
retirement or otherwise, of special education personnel.<br>

<li>Change due process procedures. These procedures are essential to ensure
the rights of parents and individuals with disabilities. LDA is reluctant
to support any changes in procedural safeguards unless such changes
continue to protect the rights and enhance the educational opportunities
of children with learning disabilities.<br>

<li>Allow cessation of educational services to any student with disabilities.
LDA agrees that a student with disabilities who brings a weapon or drugs
to school, when such behavior is found not to be a manifestation of
his/her disability, may be removed from his/her current placement and
placed in an alternative placement.  However, LDA strongly believes that
cessation of educational services is harmful not only to the student and
his/her family, but also to the community at large.
