<H1>Taints and off-flavours</H1>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>


<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="sniff200.gif" alt=sniff test align=bottom>Taints and off-flavours (and off odours) are a growing problem for the food, drink and cosmetic industries. The problem can occur from a variety of sources, including packaging migration, environmental pollutants, microbial spoilage, process problems, factory paints, cleaning solvents. Trace levels of a contaminant can affect many tonnes of production so it is vital that the contaminant and its source are identified as quickly as possible. </P>

<P>RSSL has particular expertise in this field and has helped many many companies over the years to resolve specific problems. Using <A HREF="sensory.html">sensory evaluation</A> techniques, followed by sophisticated chemical extraction and identification procedures, RSSL can identify the most potent tainting chemicals down to parts per trillion concentrations. The result of these investigations is often critical in helping manufacturers secure compensation from suppliers or distributors for their part in causing the problem.</P>
