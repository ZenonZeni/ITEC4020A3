Czech Immigration/Bulgarian Emigration</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The Czech Republic has one of the lowest unemployment rates in

Europe, three percent, which is attributed to low wages and a location that

attracts foreign investment, flexible labor markets with stingy unemployment

benefits and a slow restructuring of old state-owned industries.<p>

There are 250,000 foreign workers, mostly from Eastern Europe, employed in

the Czech Republic.  A Ukrainian worker employed for $2.50 per hour reported

that he paid a labor broker 50 percent of his hourly wage.<p>

Some Czech officials worry that granting asylum to a Vietnamese political

refugee may lead to the occupation of Czech embassies in Asia by Vietnamese

seeking asylum.  Kim Long applied for asylum at the Czech embassy in Thailand,

was granted refugee status by UN authorities in Bangkok and allowed to fly

Prague, where he was granted asylum.  Long intends to try to migrate to Canada,

where he has relatives.<p>

Educated Bulgarians are reportedly emigrating as fast as they can find

countries to take them.  According to the most recent Bulgarian census, about

500,000 of Bulgaria's 8.5 million residents have emigrated since 1990, with

most moving to the US (35 percent), Germany, the UK and Austria.  In 1995, more

than 7,000 professors and researchers, who average $50 per month in Bulgaria,

emigrated.  A survey found that 40 percent of Bulgaria's scientists are

planning to emigrate.  <p>
