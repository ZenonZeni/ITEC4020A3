        <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>A MAJOR VICTORY FOR
CONSUMERS</CENTER></H3>

Did you know that until October 8, 1994, the FDA was able to remove at whim
various dietary supplements from store shelves?  It could do this by simply alleging
that the products contained unapproved food additives.  And it could do this even if
the products had been medically validated to have beneficial use.  But no more, FDA,
no more!

<P>     It was a hard-fought victory.  With only hours to spare in the 103rd Congress,
the House of Representatives Joined the United States Senate in approving, by
unanimous consent, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.  You, the
people, helped make it happen!  Phenomenal grass roots pressure from every state and
Congressional district in the United States, combined with determined political
leadership by the bill's sponsors, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Congressman Bill
Richardson (D-NM), contributed to the bill's unopposed passage.

        <P>If you swallow a single supplement, this bill represents a major victory for you.
 It's certainly an important conquest for those of us who &quot;rattle&quot; when we leave the
table.  As for the natural products industry, a holiday mood pervades despite a few
minor concerns.

        <P>For the first time, the FDA will be required to notify any individual,
establishment, or business in writing ten days in advance of an intended enforcement
action.  No more drawn guns and surprise attacks!

        <P>The bill also benefits consumers by permitting information about conditions of
use to appear on the label of a dietary supplement, without allowing the FDA to
misbrand the product a &quot;drug.&quot; Under the new law, a significant amount of information
previously unavailable to consumers may now be at hand for the first time.  The bill
amends labeling provisions by eliminating burdensome, useless, and nonessential
information previously required.  Manufacturers only need to declare what is actually
in the product.

        <P>How pleased Carlton Fredericks and Adele Davis would have been to hear that
Congress now acknowledges the link between nutrients and dietary supplements and the
prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis.  How
hard they worked to get that message out against a tide of government and mainstream
medical disapproval.  And how right they were!

        <P>Wouldn't Hippocrates have been pleased if he could see the current medical
community and learn that Congress has accepted the fact that consumers want more
holistic consideration of their needs!

        <P>And wouldn't Linus Pauling rejoice about the recognition, finally, that the
nutritional supplement industry is an integral part of the economy of the United
States.

        <P>The best news is that third-party literature such as books, chapters from books,
and newsletters such as the Digest-containing articles and information to help you
stay well or get well-are no longer considered &quot;labeling&quot; and so may be used in
health food stores in conjunction with the sale of a product.  The literature does
need to be separated from a particular product but may be sold from the book sections
of stores in an effort to educate everyone about nutrients that engender health.

        <P>We don't mind that the manufacturer cannot make a direct health claim.  It's okay
that the label on vitamin C cannot read, &quot;Vitamin C prevents cancer&quot; or that it 
cannot say, &quot;Vitamin C helps to lessen inflammation or infection.: The good book corner will cite 
the good studies. And we'll all know the gfood truth about taking supplements 
for good health.
