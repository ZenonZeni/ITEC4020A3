MK - WASHINGTON CONSTRUCTION MERGER APPROVED</B>
</CENTER><P>
Boise -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that the company's plan 
of reorganization was approved by Judge Peter Walsh of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, District of Delaware. The plan calls for the merger of Morrison 
Knudsen and Washington Construction Group, Inc. and an exchange of MK's 
approximately $360 million in secured debt and contingent liabilities
for new equity in the company and other assets.  The plan received the 
unanimous approval of MK's secured creditors and was supported by 90% of 
the shareholders who responded to the solicitation.<P>
     The company also announced that it has reached agreement with Bank of 
Montreal, as agent, for a $200 million credit facility with a five year 
term.  MK has also reached agreement on a bonding arrangement with a 
surety syndicate led by Federal Insurance Company, The St. Paul Surety  
and American Home Insurance Group (AIG) which provides complete bonding 
support to meet MK's business objectives. <P>
     After the merger, Morrison Knudsen will be essentially debt free, 
with bonding capacity as required, a net worth of more than $300 million 
and an established $200 million line of credit.  MK's core engineering & 
construction, heavy civil construction, environmental and mining groups 
will have revenue approaching $2 billion annually and a backlog of $4 
billion. The combined company has 10,000 employees at work throughout the 
United States and in 25 countries. The merger will be effective on 
September 11, 1996.<P>
     "The MK-Washington merger combines the strength of two great 
companies. Washington Construction's financial strength, bonding capacity 
and operating expertise in heavy construction and contract mining are a 
perfect fit with Morrison Knudsen's Heavy Construction and Mining Groups,
and complements MK's design, engineering and construction capabilities in 
the industrial process, power and environmental markets, " said Robert A. 
Tinstman, MK's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We emerge as a 
company with operational focus, financial strength and proven management. 
All of our clients -- 100% of them -- stayed with MK during our recent 
challenges and our 10,000 employees have consistently rewarded that 
loyalty by providing the best engineering and construction expertise in 
the world."<P>
