  <body><h4>
  The eighth semiannual meeting of the Transportation External
  Coordination Working Group (TEC/WG) was held January 16-18,
  1996, in San Antonio, Texas. TEC/WG, a partnership between
  the Department of Energy (DOE) and its stakeholder
  organizations, works to identify and resolve significant
  issues related to DOE's transportation of radioactive
  hazardous materials. TEC/WG's members -- all of whom share an
  interest in the Department's transportation-related
  activities --  include personnel from various DOE program and
  project offices; national and regional organizations
  representing State, Tribal, and local governments;
  professional associations; and industry organizations.
  <p>
  In a series of plenary sessions, the group received updates
  on current activities within the Department. Representatives
  of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management and
  the Office of Environmental Management (EM) provided an
  overview of current activities within each office.
  Representatives from EM's Spent Nuclear Fuel Program, the
  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, and EM's Coordinated Research
  Program provided updates on transportation-related
  activities within these programs. Representatives of the
  University of New Mexico shared findings from the study,
  "Transporting Radioactive Materials: Risks, Issues, and
  Public Perspectives," with the group. TEC/WG members
  representing the Council of State Governments Midwestern
  Office, the Council of State Governments/Eastern Regional
  Conference, and the Nuclear Energy Institute participated in
  a panel to share their perspectives with other members of
  TEC/WG and DOE.
  <p>
  Participants discussed specific issues in greater detail
  during a series of four breakout sessions. Two breakout
  sessions were devoted to topics within General Planning and
  Transportation Operations. A third breakout session involved
  participants in an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
  TEC/WG meetings. In the fourth breakout, participants
  visited a Communication and Information Data Resources Room
  to learn more about communication and resource systems
  currently in place.
  <p>
  The next TEC/WG meeting is tentatively scheduled for July
  16-18 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
