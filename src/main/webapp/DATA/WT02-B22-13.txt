<H4><CENTER><I>What religion do you believe in (that is not listed in the survey)?</I></CENTER></H4>
<H5>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PHIL -->
<LI>Even though I am agnostic, I "lean" heavily towards atheism.  Anyone can say "I am angostic," but you have to work off of some type of paradigm.digm.
<LI>I believe in Jesus Christ and his death & resurrection, but I do not believe in those hypocrites such as Pat Robertson and crew.
<LI>Follow the teachings of the Saviour Jesus Christ and your life will be blessed.
<LI>God, who created everything, created everyone with free will and the option of refusing to love and obey his Creator.  When the first people sinned, they created a "paradox" situation, where our infinitely loving but also infinitely fair Creator (who can do anything *but* act against His eternal and unchanging character) had to simultaneously "forgive" and "punish" mankind.  The only Being in the universe capable of solving this "paradox" was Jehovah, Himself and He did it by coming in human form to ta
e our punishment and bring forgiveness for our sins - all at the same time!
<LI>Mankind is fallen,following Jesus is the ONLY way to God and salvation.
<LI>religion is important
<LI>Life hurts, but you can change this.
<LI>love and respect for all.
<LI>I believe that religion is a way for people to feel somewhat better about themselves. I don't think religion is bad.
<LI>I believe in God, but I respect others who have different beliefs, and ultimately having LOVE for one anotheris what matters.
<LI>The question of an alleged "after-life" is a non-sequitur -- We will all KNOW soon enough.  As far as a "supreme being" goes, it can neither be proven, nor disproven; therefore it is ridiculous to take a stand either way.  Article of FAITH cannot be PROVEN.
<LI>I find it very difficult to reconcile the difference between what the Bible teaches and what I believe to be truth from what the churches tout as what should be done.  Because of this, I rarely attend church.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the only way!!!
<LI>Love, devotion and surrender
<LI>I have a spiritual teacher--a Guru.  His name is Da Avabhasa. His teachings are a fusion of Hinduism and Buddhism.
<LI>It helps solidify good morals
<LI>Be nice!
<LI>It's not about religion, it's about a relationship.  God came to earth as man to redeem us back to himself - that man is the Jesus Christ.
<LI>There are 10 rules.  Obey them and you will be rewarded!
<LI>Religion means "way of life" and though personal and individual, cannot be considered separate form the rest of the community.
<LI>1)tolerance  2)walk lightly  3)imagination
<LI>Laa illaha illallah
<LI>I am a Muslim, i.e. I submit myself willingly to the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth: Allah
<LI>The bible does not "tolerate" homosexuality, & I can't comprehend why certain religions would even debate on it. Hardly any religion tells their followers what the Kingdom on God is. It is a government that will be set up by Christ (when he returns) to rule mankind for a thousand years, as it's quite obvious we can't manage on our own. Although I don't belong to any one faith, & feel that there is no "one true religion", I think that the Church of God International and Jehovah's Witnesses are about the
closest.
<LI>If I am to believe in any religion it must be consentrated upon this life
<LI>religion is just a sense of "MORALS", nothing more, nothing less
<LI>Religion is Psychological.
<LI>Spiritual beliefs are good, but don't impose them!
<LI>will self
<LI>religion is mind control
<LI>I must believe that there is a purpose or guiding force to all things to avoid the logical nihilism of a purely rational belief system.
<LI>We need to work towards progressing humanity so as to seek closeness to Allah SWT.
<LI>I believe that Jesus Christ died for the sins of humanity.  It is our decision to accept Jesus as our atonement for sins.  Afterwards, we will spend eternity with Him or away from Him based on our decision.
<LI>To live in every aspect of life acc.the will of the Almighty G'd
<LI>People who kill in the name of Religion are very frightening and distrurbed.  The fact that this has been going on for centuries, makes me somewhat biased against "religous" people.
<LI>I do not accept the existance of any deity.
<LI>I wasn't very religious, then I bought a Jesus statue, hung it on my car mirror and then found a $20 bill on the sidewalk!  Hallejulah!  But seriously, the question of religion is an enigma; delving into peoples' beliefs says nothing about the viability or reality of related concepts - it's a statement on society, on psychology about which of us are logically-motivated or emotionally-motivated in our thinking. If some religions didn't feel obligated to propogate their philosophies among people unintere
ted, there wouldn't be so much bad talk about it, but there is because many religions consider themselves mutually-exclusive of the others and therefore intolerant.  This is the big hypocrisy of religion - a guiding light, an instruction manual for life with a bunch of fine print which disclaims any sins that are perpetrated in the name of preserving your beliefs and communal structure.
<LI>You may do anything you want - as long as you are prepared to accept the conseques of your actions
<LI>Look at society, they've taken out religion and look No Morals nowadays.
<LI>Religion is a crutch for the mentally weak.
<LI>believe yourself
<LI>Science might give us the answar if there is one. Politics are of little use when it comes to guide peobles life. Religion give peoble identity - few are actually strong believers, though.
<LI>While I would say I believe in an afterlife, I think that Hell is death and the grave.  It isn't as simple as a either or arguement, and I don't pretend to have the answer, but I believe Christ is my savior, my friend and Lord.
<LI>We are all on a journey to the same destination; the roads are many, but the destination is the same.
<LI>I feel that religion can be useful for some people who are unable to fully deal with reality, but it is an immature response to the pressures of existence.  I do believe that everyone has a right to be immature though! :-)
<LI>Religion should be individual, and not based on someone else's values or beliefs
<LI>Choose wisely and pray fervently in the name of Jesus Christ -- you will receive the direction that you need from the Holy Ghost.
<LI>I believe in God and am a Christian. I may not always follow the right path but when I do it's worth it. Every one needs to believe in something and for me Jesus is the way.
<LI>Ride the energy of lifen negotiate when necessary
<LI>God created everything and creation is basically good.  Christianity and its principles if lived fully would bring heaven on earth.
<LI>Let the life energy flow only to negotiate when necessary.
<LI>I believe everything you do will come back to you
<LI>Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose after his crucifixion so that we might be able to enter the kingdom of heaven and live for eternity when we die.
<LI>Religion can be a guideline to a better understaning of your purpose in this world
<LI>God is good
<LI>Religion is a man made concept. A relationship with the Creator of the universe is what is more important.
<LI> Organized religion is nothing but a man-made method of limiting God. 
<LI>Karma is the basis of my belief system...could also be termed "Do unto others..."
<LI>Be happy and content now
<LI>There is no God.  When you die, you rot.  People want desperately to believe that there is something higher in the universe, but there isn't.  All you see around you is all there is.  We are just bags of skin containing chemicals.  Religion, in general, has done far more harm than good for society.
<LI>Really don't know what to believe anymore!
<LI>Live and let live.  But I feel that religion is a crutch to many people who lack an acceptance of death.
<LI>Under the "What is your religion?" question, there is no difference between Islam and Muslim, I don't understand why you gave two options there.
<LI>Allah knows all and the only path to success is through His guidance
<LI>be nice to one another and wait to see what happens
<LI>Religion can teach us the principles to live a happy life and have peace in the life after.  Religion can be the "user's manual" to this life.
<LI>Strive to live in peace and to respect all life
<LI>Religion is very important in helping to develop morals in kids as long as it's not forced on them.  They need to know that there is some hope in this world.
<LI>what poor gods we do make.
<LI>Seventh-Day Adventist, if you know anything about them, than that is how I believe!
<LI>Do what you want, but harm none.
<LI>I believe that the most important function of any religion is to teach and promote love, understanding, and acceptance of everyone.
<LI>everyone is entitled to their own beliefs
<LI>I believe in God, the father, Jesus, the son, and the Holy Spirit.
<LI>Religion has been used extensively to control and as an opiate of the masses, but religion can and could better be used as a tool to self-realization, awareness, and tolerance. 
<LI>Religion is too often used as a weapon to defend ill-meant ideals and policies, especially in America.  This, more than anything, keeps me away.
<LI>I am not religious; I am spiritual- there is a difference
<LI>I believe there is a supreme being of some sort.  I just don't know if it is GOD, JESUS or a superior being from another place, like PLanet 12.
<LI>there is no god but god and mohammed is the last messenger of god. "god is the greatest"
<LI>Religion is only for the insecure
<LI>I am Catholic but have a problem with the intolerance within the church...I basically feel people should be who they want...
<LI>religeon is used when ppl fear, i have nothing to fear
<LI>We exist to Glorify God and enjoy Him forever !
<LI>Culturally, I am Jewish.  Spiritually, I believe more in some Eastern philosophical tenants.
<LI>Humanist - must place hope in people, not God
<LI>Love God and love the other as you love yourself. Everything else is details.
<LI>Believe what you believe, as long as it helps us to get along.
<LI>Moderation...tolerance...postitive progress....
<LI>I am a Celtic Wiccan, however I practiced Christianity for 18 years. I belive that everyone should be free to make their own decisions and everyone else should respect that freedom.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.
<LI>Read some Nietzsche.
<LI>Organized religion is wonderful for people who need it.  There is no ultimate "truth", different organized religions were created by god/godess to help people.
<LI>When religion is used aws an exuse for not being responsible, for not considering issues and options, it is destructive.  No minister, priest or other religious leader is God.  Spirituality means you must respect yourself, others and the world around you.  You must know your own mind and heart; the choices you make are yours alone.
<LI>"An it harm none, do what ye will"
<LI>We all have and must find our own way.
<LI>I belive that Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation, and He is my savior, Father, and Lord!
<LI>I am an observent Jew. It works for me.
<LI>Extremely disillusioned, worshipping alone, possiby becoming agnostic/atheist
<LI>Submit fully to the one who created you. Humbly, and obediently, for the Creator is All Powerful over the created.
<LI>My heart would like some definite answers, but my head won't allow such certainty and finality.
<LI>This is it.  Better be as good as you can--you don't get a second chance, you don't get "forgiven", you don't get 'eternal peace' or 'eternal damnation'.  This is it.  Enjoy yourself responsibly.
<LI>anyone can beleive in anything
<LI>As long as you don't hurt someone it will probably be OK
<LI>I am not religious, however this does not mean that I do not have morals.
<LI>An' it harm none, do what thou wilt.
<LI>If you take a little bit of all religions and things like astrology and psychic phenomenons then you find the truth.
<LI>God is the Creator of all.  Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, who died on a cross a perfect man.  He rose again in 3 days and has forgiven all humanity of their sins.  Someday he will come back and reclaim all who accept him.  
<LI>I am god
<LI>I believe in one God who is both good and evil. He exists in neither chaos or perfection but in a balance of energy.
<LI> I have just currently became interested in religion. I found that witchcraft seems to fit my personality.
<LI>I do not know my religion.
<LI>Organized religion is very dangerous and should be watched very carefully; however, as most people feel they "need" it, it cannot be eliminated in fairness to them
<LI>I believe in the cross and the ressurection of Jesus Christ amd being born again
<LI>Do unto others...
<LI>Religion is a dead set of rules.  I believe in an experience with Jesus Christ.  Accepting Him as Lord and Savior of your life, is the key to joy and fulfillment in life.  This is the just the beginning of Life.  I believe in Resurrection to Eternal Life if you are saved, or eternal damnation if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.  I also believe in the fullness of The Holy Spirit and the gifts and offices appointed by The Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit is the Power that God 
ill give you to enable you to live in this world for His purpose and His Glory.
<LI>To be able to grasp the concept of Christianity leads to living an abundant life in all aspects of this life and in the one to come.
<LI>I do not beleive in religion I beleive in God
<LI>There is no one true way.
<LI>I believe in God, but not necessarily in how He is described in Church doctorate.
<LI>God gave us brains. Use them to earnestly seek the truth. Remember, to seek the truth necessarily means you are not arrogant but humble.
<LI>I think that the reason most people are religious is that they need something to belive in, andthat crappy things happen to them for a reason.
<LI>Strong ethical beliefs but unsure of religious beliefs.
<LI>Christ gives me strengh to go through life. If it wasn't for the lord, I would have killed myself.
<LI>God is Love.
<LI>To know Christ and make him known - No Christ No Peace, Know Christ Know Peace
<LI>If religion is supposed to benefit the human race then someone with a really sick mind has determined what's beneficial to us...just take a look at the history of religious strife...
<LI>I believe in a moral code, completely separate from any religious coercion.  I don't need to fear a god or gods to know what's right and wrong!
<LI>Live and Let Live
<LI>I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins on the cross, and that by believing in him, I will gain eternal life.  I am by no means perfect, but am sanctified by Christ.
<LI>religion has spawned from ignorance and maintains it's destiny
<LI>We are here on earth to follow the commandments of our Savior so we can live eternally with our family.
<LI>There is no God but Allah; He is the One, the Eternal
<LI>I struggle between the strict heaven/hell, God/Devil view of my upbringing, and a more holistic, evolving concept of God and Spiritualism
<LI>I will simply calrify answer 14.  Spirituality is personal, while organized religion is... unproductive/destructive/delusional/etc.
<LI>The universe is divine and it is not personified.  It is in all of us and all things and we must respect it and one another.
<LI>Without religion, where is hope?
<LI>Cannot fathom how some people believe in an all powerful supreme being. There is absolutely no evidence and never will be.
<LI>"I (Jesus) am the way, the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me". (John 14:6 ).  
<LI>Christ died for our sins & to give us eternal life.
<LI>Nietzsche is God - The Dead
<LI>Your purpose in life is to give all glory and honor to God.  This is best accomplished by living as Jesus showed us.
<LI>Live and let live
<LI>Amen
<LI>To each there own. As above, so below. One cannot discover new lands without first loosing sight of that familiar shore.
<LI>God is One...One is All...All is everything
<LI>Don't pass your judgement on someone else.  In other words, don't make laws that outlaw abortions/anything just because YOU think it's wrong/right.  Let people take care of themselves.
<LI>i am not capable of creating myself. whatever did (not meaning parents) is "god", sentient or otherwise.
<LI>Atheism but I am inspired by the ideals of Zen insofar as I understand them. As a former Catholic priest, I am convinced that doctrinal religion is almost always destructive of individual rationality and ethics.
<LI>religion is good if you are happy.  If it oppresses you, then trash it- just believe whatever you want.
<LI>Radical christian, informed by the revolutionary teaching of Jesus
<LI>Religion is a mental cop-out for people who cannot face up to reality
<LI>My faith is a somewhat weak one due to my skeptical nature, but I have seen too much goodness in the teachings of Christ to feel that it is simply an "option." It is rather, a spiritual guide.
<LI>Don't push your values on others (laws etc.)
<LI>i do not attend church or have a religon but i  believe  in god      
<LI>I'm not a very religious person but it does serve some useful socialization functions.  Overall, though, we need to be tolerant of other people's values.  That's why I don't go in for all this pro-life, anti-homosexual, fundamentalist shit.
<LI>I'm not a very religious person but it does serve some useful socialization functions.  Overall, though, we need to be tolerant of other people's values.  That's why I don't go in for all this pro-life, anti-homosexual, fundamentalist shit.
<LI>God sent His only Son JESUS CHRIST to die for our sins and bring us eternal life. Repent and receive Him as Lord and Savior.
<LI>It's quite simple. Jesus Christ is the only way to God.
<LI>Jesus died for our sins
<LI>The concept of 'god' is so extreme that it would take positive proof for me to believe in it. Since all proof is unfalsifiable that has been presented to me so far, I cannot possibly believe in a god at this time, and do not plan on believing in one in th
<LI>I think it's arrogant to assume that without religion there is no 'morality' unless you what to define morality as something that religion imposes, otherwise I think the idea of treating others the way you'd like to be treated can address 99.9% of all the important humanitarian and family issues that religion is supposed to be the ultimate cure for. As far as Christianity, I have a very difficult time believing that I'm somehow responsible for events which [supposedly] happened millenia ago - that I ca
ry around some original sin [original guilt]. If this is true; if we are responsible for the actions of our ancestors, we should be praying to the Native Americans whose world we destroyed, the Africans and all other indigineous cultures we decimated in the name of "progress" and "morality". But the BIGGEST PROBLEM with religion is its inconsistency and hypocrisy - which explains why their leaders have historically chosen the sword over the pen.
<LI>What ever  happens   Happens
<LI>I align with Catholocism, but I want control over my own body!
<LI>I am an Independent Baptist, KJV1611 believing, premillenial, pretribulational.
<LI>Many of our actions and all post-mortem beliefs are controlled by a higher state of our own consciousnesses.  What one truly believes will happen to them after death is what really will happen.
<LI>I am kind of a Baptist who doesn't think that God cares if I get up at 7am on Sunday morning....
<LI>I believe in a loving Higher Power who graciously gave us the wonder of life to share and enjoy
<LI>Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Light and the only way unto salvation.
<LI>Who created you? why? Will and can "he" create me again after death? Why is it impossible or possible? Which is the true religion now? How to find it? One criteria:To which religion people from all the world from all countries(nearly) are converting by studying it, not for worldly money or benefits.
<LI>I am not going to convert, so if you hit me with religious bullshit, then FUCK YOU.
<LI>I tend not to look at myself in terms of rligion but in terms of belief
<LI>When Religion fails in this country, what will be used to control the masses?  As religion becomes more distant to the individual and more driven by false phrophets interested in only money; then one must look closely at the Book of Revelation and the writings of Nostraedomus.
<LI>Love God with my whole heart & soul, and my neighbor has myself.  Live the Golden Rule and do the job God sent me to do.
<LI>Fundamntalist, evangelical, christian
<LI>Each one of us is a child of God.  Treat each person with that in mind.
<LI>God is the creator of all things, he sent his only Son, Jesus, to pay the price for our sins, a price which we could not possibly pay.  You cannot possibly seperate your beliefs from your everyday life, as many people would have us do.  Would Jesus?
<LI>Orthodox Evangelical Christianity:  Jesus is the only way to God, and he is in fact God (part of the trinity)
<LI>I am answerable to a just God.  I have not met his moral requirements.  He gave his son, Jesus, to receive the punishment I deserve, and to give me the life I need.  God loves me.  I trust in Christ for salvation and seek to serve him because I am grateful.
<LI>Good for goodness sake.  The detail are not important.
<LI>If religion is basically a joke, then it only follows that the ULTIMATE RELIGION must be the ULTIMATE JOKE.  And as a keeper of the Joke, I demand to be taken very seriously.
<LI>Our whole purpose on this Earth is to do what G-d wants and to reveal G-dliness on Earth
<LI>The Golden Rule
<LI>Everyone practices his/her REAL religion, whether or not it is formally named as such.  I believe in the Golden Rule, and would not coerce anyone.  EVERYONE has some portion of Truth.
<LI>Faith is more than just a set of beliefs.  These beliefs should lead us to a personal relationship with God, our heavenly Father.
<LI>Submit to the Will of God
<LI>I am strong enough to believe in myself. I do not need others, whether mortal, deities, etc., to control my destiny.
<LI>God exists, God is love, God loves me
<LI>Regardless of what faith you are, the most important thing is not your religion.  Its your belief in Jesus Christ, your salvation.
<LI>I don not consider Christianity to be a religion.  A religion a set of rules to gain God's favor.  Christianity is based on what God has done to restore our relationship with Him.  All we have to do is accept his gift of forgiveness.
<LI>I consider "religion" to be a political system as opposed to "spirituality". My answers reflect this. 
<LI>Jesus Christ is Lord and Creator of all and receiving His sacrafice for sins and inviting Him to live in your spirit is the only way to come to God and enter into Heaven both now and when you die.
<LI>I believe that religion is intensely personal, but we need community (the communion of saints) to assist us in maintaining a balance.  Even though I have very strong beliefs, I do not believe that my way is the only path to salvation and/or peace and happiness.
<LI>Jesus Christ, son of the one true God, paid a price no one else could pay, thus giving those who believe in Him, eternal life with God in Heaven (a very nice place).
<LI>Shit happens, and in general, it's not too bad.
<LI>Love for God and Race, and Nation.
<LI>Jesus said, "Without me, you can do nothing."
<LI>Jesus came to give us life now and forever
<LI>John 3:16.  For God so loved. . .Beliving this it is not an act of love to hide the Good News, but an act of selfiness & cowardice.
<LI>Humans search relentlessly and frantically to find what God offers free of charge to all, through the love, grace and mercy of His Son, Jesus Christ.   My hope is that each one who reads this can find what I have found in Christ.
<LI>god is a tree god is a dog god is a sunset god is a little old lady god is flower god is ....
<LI>Humans search relentlessly and frantically to find what God offers free of charge to all, through the love, grace and mercy of His Son, Jesus Christ.   My hope is that each one who reads this can find what I have found in Christ.
<LI>Heaven is more important than anything else
<LI>God the Creator of all things became a Man in Jesus Christ.  He died for my sins (and the sin of the whole world), was raised from the dead for our justification, and will soon come again to judge the world.
<LI>Jesus said, I am the Way the Truth and The Life, No man cometh to the Father but by me.
<LI>Basically, I believe in the golden rule: He who has the gold, rules. Not really, but I wish less people believed that.
<LI>A person's belief system is what helps him cope with life on a spiritial psychological and physical level and the way to truth is a personnal experience and cannot be dictated through narrow minded approaches dictated by current popular groups. The definition of an organized religious is a cult that has gained creditability by its members getting into a position of power.
<LI>I HAVE MY OWN SET OF MORALS AND VALUES, WHICH I INOUT INTO MY DAILY BEING. I AM NOT AT ALL RELIGIOUS.
<LI>Religion is another way for people to release themselves from the unhappiness of the world. When people say "God will judge" or "God will do what has to be done" or something like that, its BULLSH*T. God does nothing for us, we have to do what we have to to have a good life and improve that of society. God doesn't help nor make harder our lives so people should accept god as nothing more than a force who observes us, without any real input.
<LI>All religious experience originates in the psyche
<LI>It is far more important to not include premises in my philosophy which I cannot possibly know for sure, than it is to convince myself I've gotten it "right."
<LI>My life is devoted to follow God's Will.
<LI>I do not believe in god, but I cannot guarantee he/she does not exist.
<LI>God is love.  To love others is to love God and vice versa.
<LI>Christianity is stupid and evil.
<LI>Islam. And I do feel that a few items on #13 need to be explained further, I most likely don't profess the same beliefe as others...
<LI>I believe in Jesus Christ as our savior and to live your as close as possible to the standards set forth in the Holy Bible
<LI>I believe that every person is capable of choosing what is right for them to believe in and follow.
<LI>Religion is a personal path to those truths not accessable by rationalism.  It deals with the constant struggle to understand our relationship to God.
<LI>Polyamourous Pan-theistic pagan
<LI>Islam - Peace & Submission to Allah's Will
<LI>There is no life after death and you have to make the best out of your life here on Earth.
<LI>I am tired of the many that want to put all of their frustrations of religion onto Christians.  It seems these are always the ppl that are always stating that Christians need to be "more open minded."  Religion has always been a way of life for me, and I also know that others do not feel the same as I.  I respect that, as I would hope all others would respect me.  I love being a Christian and my walk with God has nothing to do with how anyone else sees that.  It is my walk and my belief in God makes me
stronger every day.  When in need it is always a blessing to know that I have Him no matter...hopefully we all have someone in our lives we can feel that way about.  I have three, God, my husband and my best friend.  
<LI>Religion Sucks
<LI>The sooner human society can grow up & dispense w/religon, the greater the odds there will continue to be human civilization.
<LI>as the wiccan rede says, "do what thou wilt, an' it harm none."
<LI>strong sense of self and innate goodness
<LI>Love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and mind.
<LI>You are what you make of yourself and religion shouldn't be a part of developing it
<LI>I really don't care for the word "religion".  That is a very action-oriented word.  My "religion" as stated above, is more like a personal relationship with God.
<LI>God is NOT Hate! Those who twist the word of the Bible to promote hate towrds gay, etc. are the ones who will suffer God's wrath in the end.
<LI>religion is for those to weak to live on their own
<LI>Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
<LI>Jesus Christ was sent by God the Father to shed His blood for the salvation of the world.
<LI>There's no supreme being to bail us out, so we must do all we can to help one another, to follow our innate sense of ethics, and to advance human knowledge.
<LI>I don't believe in god, but I do believe that the Christian value systen is a positive influence in the world and should be suported.
<LI>The Golden Rule says all you need to know.
<LI>THE MAINSTREAM WILL EVENTUALLY CRUSH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT. I AM VERY COMFORTABLE WITH NO DIETY, RELIGION IN MY LIFE.
<LI>THE KINGDOM IS THE MAIN THEME OF THE BIBLE. THE GOOD NEWS DESCRIBED AT MATH.24:14 IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL PROFESSED CHRISTIANS TO PREACH. THAT JEHOVAH IS THE MOST HIGH GOD(PSALMS83:18)
<LI>Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.  Whosoever beleives in him will have eternal life
<LI>I believe the nature of the univearsal mind is uncomprehensible to us(humans). So you might as well take a serious look at any religion you come in contact with to get chance at a glimpse of the universal mind.
<LI>Religion is a system of beliefs, sacred artifacts and actions.  The religion is not important, the beliefs are.
<LI>there is something bigger than human, somewhere some place
<LI>Since god(or whatver you choose to call him/her/it) is divine he/she/it is above human undertstanding, for thsi reaosn I belive that my religion may be right, and it may be wrong to say that THIS is the way I allow otehrsto belive what tehy will and hold no gurge for it and to keep my life simple I belive what I was raised with, but no rleigon made by an can hope to udnertand something like god
<LI>I FEEL THAT IHAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GOD/SELF/SOCIETY
<LI>love for all, hatred for none
<LI>Non-selfishness. Respect for others.
<LI>Religious Studies Major
<LI>Progressive Revelation: Newer revelations confirm previous spiritual verities and sensibilities while updating social teachings
<LI>I use religion as a guiding force to help me in my life decisions.
<LI>Allah is the only God, and Mohammed is his prophit.
<LI>I am a spiritual being living a human expierience
<LI>Religion provides a background to make desisions.
<LI>Since the people who run this country have seen fit to concider all social training 'religon', schools can not provide the moral training required in society.  Thus, organized religons have a vital role in today's lifestyle, especially for children.  However, since many of the writings and teachings of the more formal and accepted faiths are dragged down with custom and tradition, it is tough to accept many of the ideals.  Just because a certain food was dangerous 1000 years ago, doesn't mean it is so 
oday.  Just because large families were desired when the world was expanding and life expectancy was short, doesn't mean that this is required today.  Just because the local church supplied much of the community unity and protection (generally under a king's rule) in the past, doesn't mean that tithe is required today.  Life is very easy.  Live as best you can, and be there to help others.  Treat each person and thing as you would like yourself treated.  It really all comes down to simple respect and under
tanding.  I live my life my way, imposing noting on another, and providing any assistance I can.  Its simple, honest, and allows me the freedom to choose.
<LI>There is no reality other then God(ALlah) so submit to what is real, leave what is not real, love what is real, do not love illusion. This world is the seed bed of the hearafter; all must die so seek God, seek the truth before you die, and the worms get y
<LI>Islam is my gate to self-confidence
<LI>Religion is the foundation that society is built.
<LI>All human misery stems ultimately from humanity's sins, and in particular from the Fall, which sundered God's relationship with Man. We are unable to bridge that gap by good works, philosophy, science, even by religion. God, seeing our empty and lost condition, loved us even though we were sinners, rebels and opposed to His kind will and just law. Out of His great love for us, he sent us a Savior, Jesus Christ His own Son, to empty Himself of his divinity and glory and be born as a simple human baby in
Bethlehem.  By His sinless life and death on the Cross, Jesus took our place, satisfying the righteous demands of God's law so that we, the guilty, could go free.  This freedom is freely available to all who will accept it, by simply accepting Jesus Christ into their heart, taking Him as their Lord and Savior, confessing and repenting of their sins and receiving complete redemption in Him.  I believe in the wonderful anticipation of Heaven and the fearful reality of Hell, and that there will be a Day of Ju
gement when God will decide the eternal destinies of all men.  At that day, all who will have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and have been born again, born from above, will be seen by God as having not ever sinned at all, but God will instead see the sinless record of Jesus in their place.  But all who have not become covered by Jesus' sacrifice will be judged strictly according to what they have done, and Hell is the terrible and agonizing result.  But no one need end there, for Christ is 
reely available to ALL.  He paid the price so we don't have to.
<LI>The search for something to believe in.
<LI>Without something to believe in I feel the world we live in would be pointless.  Might as well be a supreme being that watches and cares over us whenever we need Him.
<LI>There is a God. I am not Him.  Yeshua (Jesus) is.  Without faith in Yeshua, you will not be able to fulfil the Law (Torah) of G-d
<LI>Everyone should find THEIR way
<LI>Religion is a means to an end -- personal faith is where it's at!
<LI>regardless of what you believe, only god should judge
<LI>I am a Taoist in religious philosophy. All holy books are man-made, but the Tao te Ching is the best compendium of wisdom.
<LI>Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law. Love under will, Love is the law.
<LI>Homosexuals are to be put to death. It is Gods law!
<LI>Your life is judged by how you treat others.  God is a power and therefore does not have a human-like ego that humans need to "worship".
<LI>I BELIEVE THAT YOU MUST RESPECT PEOPLES INDIVIDUALITY UNLESS IT IS HARMFUL TO OTHERS.
<LI>mine is not a religion it is a faith.  Anyone can be religious and nothing changes.
<LI>I believe in the power of positive thinking through the father, son and holy ghost.
<LI>Religious dogma is a pain in the ass.
<LI>Christian Adamic. I Beleive White People are true Israelites and Jews are Kazars not God's chosen people.
<LI>I believe that the most important thing in life is to have a personal relationship with God through the Lord Jesus.  Only through belief in him and his death on the cross can we have forgiveness for sins and assurance of Eternal Life
<LI>It is not religion but a daily personal relationship with the Creator of everything Abba Father.  This relationship is only obtained through acceptance of atonement for sin through Jesus Christ the Father's only Son.
<LI>Christ taught love, all else is false religion
<LI>It's there for people that want it

<LI>Religion is the message from the world beyond all humans will at last move to
<LI>Religion developed historically to explain that which man did not understand.
<LI>God doesn't care what you think; only how you behave.
<LI>I cannot accept any infinites - No all-powerful or all-knowing entities or forces, no forever.  I tend to believe in free will, but not strongly.
<LI>do what thou will,lest ye harm none
<LI>Christianity is a pagan apostasy of the New Testament. Jesus was not Messiah's Name, it is Latin (Shining Swine) and Satanic. Christians have the prophecy backwards, "Jesus" and "Christ" are both perfect 666 in Chaldean/Hebrew numerology.
<LI>life is an interconnected web, Golden Rule
<LI>I believe religion is generally good, but the fanatics who have become so rigid and intollerable have almost made religion a farce
<LI>supreme being is not active, but curious. curiosity drives the universe.
<LI>Youre born, you die. The End
<LI>Almost every wars in earth's history have been started by one religion or another.  Have you heard the saying "God is on our side."?  The European "Dark Ages" were caused by religious intolerance.  I try to avoid anything that smacks of religion.
<LI>I belive in some kind of GOD, but my way of life is from the Jewish tradition that is respect a lot.
<LI>Humanism
<LI>Religion was made to guide us through a rough time.  We're above that now; it's holding us back from advancing further.
<LI>Believe in Jesus,confess your sins to HIM and you will have eternal life. It is that simple. Everyone should try it!
<LI>Everyone is different, so religion has a different purpose for each individual.  But no one should force there beliefs on another unless it would cause that person non-"spiritual" harm.
<LI>Forget the truth, I'm looking for a soothing lie
<LI>if you live a good life and help others, you do not need fanatical rteligious beliefs to be "saved"
<LI>O.J.Simpson is guilty as sin of murder
<LI>We came from nothing we'll go back to nothing
<LI>Don't preach at me. and I won't preach at you.
<LI>I believe that the most important thing is to indeed do unto others as you would have them do unto you (even though I'm no longer a Christian; I'm an atheist.) I feel we cannot possibly KNOW there is a god, heaven or hell, or what happens to us after death; most pick a belief to comfort them rather than thinking we simply cease to be. I do hope, and usually believe, in a soul or spirit that goes on, but if there is none then we should let our deeds and for some our children go on for us.
<LI>My personal philosophy is something that I have not yet entirely defined.  It does include a belief in a "higher power" (or whatever you want to call it), reincarnation, karma, etc.  From my perspective, the main purpose of "religion" is to be of service to others in the best way you can.
<LI>Jesus is Lord, He provided the way for a relationship with God and He will return to judge us all.
<LI>Religion is a tool we use to explain life to ourselves. A tool is not good or evil, constructive or destructive, in and of itself, but in how it is used.  On the other hand, there is a limit to how many homes you can build with a sword. Each tool has an inherent purpose which may be difficult to overcome.
<LI>All I know is that I don't know.
<LI>It's not part of my life
<LI>I believe that one must find God in oneself, not "out there".  It is the greatest happiness to find Him.
<LI>Quit looking to death to get to heaven, try to create it here on earth you religious hypocrites.
<LI>An it harm none, do as you will
<LI>I am a devout Catholic and believe in Papal infalliabity
<LI>Biblical Christianity is based only on belief that we are helpless to save ourselves through our own goodness; Christ died and rose again as the ultimate sacrifice and supreme gift of salvation to us; we must individually accept the gift by receiving him as savior and Lord; we will grow in good works because our salvation is secure when we believe.
<LI>Love one another and grow in Christ together.
<LI>Mind your own problems and let other people deal with their own.
<LI>I don't believe that religion perse is the important thing ...JESUS CHRIST is 
<LI>God has set me free, who in the hell are you telling me what I can and cannot do.
<LI>Belief in the Lord Jesus, not works, is the only way.  Only God can judge the heart of others. A christian must be an example by our actions, respecting all people.
<LI>True religion (truth) is the key to happiness and eternal peace.
<LI>Christianity is POPULAR MYTHOLOGY--I believe in it because I was raised to do so, not because I want to.  I have no choice.
<LI>live right and you will be rewarded later.
<LI>God answers all prayers; trust in Him and He will pull through
<LI>religion is a snare and a racket
<LI>To leave the world better than you found it.
<LI>As a Christian, I believe God is a loving God but also a just God. There is only one way to heaven and that is through Jesus Christ. All other paths lead to hell and eternal separation from God.
<LI>There's nothing out there
<LI>...relax, ...get the best out of myself, enjoy and experience all life has to offer
<LI>Jesus is not so much a religion as He is a reality.  
<LI>All I believe is that if you accept Christ in your heart God will forgive you for your sins and you will be saved thats all.
<LI>An' it harm none, do what you will.
<LI>I believe strongly in my particular theology, but probably more strongly that I should not judge the beliefs of others!
<LI>be good as you see fit, that is what god does
<LI>Introspection is the key to enlightenment.
<LI>In the beginning, man created GOD.
<LI>Everyone believes in something.  Respect for the other person's belief is important, no matter how much it differs from yours.
<LI>We are part of a whole greater than everything combined.  Group worship can destroy the necessary, personal relationships with the Supreme Being.
<LI>Religious Fanatics are either naive or hypocrites 
<LI>Live and let live
<LI>Atheism towards Jud/Xian; Skeptic towards ALL
<LI>Nothing has ever been proven, and I refuse to believe nearly impossibe fables to base my life on.
<LI>Christian, Agnostic, Pagan, and completely open.
<LI>Believe in and read the Bible, pray to God, ask for forgiveness for we all sin daily.
<LI>Do unto others and respect all religions!
<LI>God does not  play dice ....
<LI>Organized religion throughout history has proven to be more of a destructive and devisive force than a positive.  It breeds intolerance and divisiveness.  If we, as humans, were to be tolerant of all religions and to not feel driven to force our own particular religious beliefs on others, the world would be a far happier and peaceful place for all mankind.  If we all were to treat each other with kindness and respect, there truely would be a heaven on earth.
<LI>allow for gray areas in understanding, identify moral principles to live by, respect others in their beliefs
<LI>Love the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole mind and love your neighbor as yourself.  
<LI>I was raised Russian Orthodox; I am now an agnostic, but I do have an interest in Buddhism
<LI>I believe aliens may have had some role in our evolution, but i am not waiting around for them or god!
<LI>If we all followed the principles of religions, Earth would be no different than heaven.
<LI>Belief in various religions can result in behavior that is either incredibly altruistic or incredible destructive but either way its just not true! I just hope its used for good since it doesnt look like its going away any time soon.
<LI>Organized religion has generally played a very positive role in society, with a few obvious exceptions - the Inquistion and Jerry F. 
<LI>i believe in god, but think that organized religion is unnecessary and does more harm than good.,

<LI>There is one god.  There is more to life than this.
<LI>Jesus is Savior and Lord.
<LI>I believe that that people use religion to explain the unknown.  I also think that people should trust in themselves first, then find their God.
<LI>"I believe Christianity like I believe in the sun. Not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else." CS Lewis
<LI>Without religion there are no values and without values we'd be a jungle

<LI>Jesus saves... Gretzky gets the rebound and SCORES!
<LI>God is everybody and everybody is God
<LI>I believe that Jesus Christ died buried and was resurrected for our sins.  As believers, we can ask Jesus to come into our hearts and will live in us through the Holy Spirit.
<LI>The Ten Commandments
<LI>Do as you will as long as it harms no one.
<LI>God made evrything, so we should respect and honor Him.
<LI>Any religion is a self-perpetuating myth.
<LI>If something feels right, and it is legal, do it.
<LI>It's all mumbo jumbo guess work.  I'd be an Atheist if I wasn't so scared of being nothing -- one can always hope, but I'm pretty pessimistic.
<LI>Without a revelation from God we could know nothing. I believe the Bible is God's revelation which teaches that Jesus, the Jew's Messiah, came into the world to pay the eternal penalty for sin, and save those who will respond to God in faith, and not try to come by works of merit which are worthless before the throne of God. He is coming soon to judge the unbelieving world and set up His Kingdom on earth. In the meantime we are to glorify Him in ALL of life, and minister His grace to others as we have 
pportunity.
<LI>Jesus died to save sinners, of which I am the worst.

<LI>To treat others the same way you'd like to be treated.
<LI>separation of church and state
<LI>Religion is normally constructive; if not for beliefs society will be more immoral than it is at present.  There are no bad religions except those that are against societal norm.  Praying to an entity comes in many forms but hopefully people will realize soon that there is only one right way.
<LI>I am a Seventh-day Adventist
<LI>Religious liberal
<LI>I don't belive in reincarnation persay, but i don't think i completely die, part of me lives on but not he 'soul'
<LI>Your questions are worded in a way which is difficult to express my real feelings.  Jesus is God (2nd in trinity) and loved the world enough to die to forgive sin.  Accepting Christ's gift is necessary for eternal life.  Jesus is the truth that can set yo

<LI>I'm not a very firm believer in my faith, but i do believe that everyone has to be true to what they believe, and not harass others because of differing views 
<LI>Institutionalization tends to devolve the spiritual aspects of religion into mere social control. There's a tendancy torwards extremism and fascism. The NAZI's after all were good christians.
<LI>I believe that there is a supreme being and an absolute morality, but not in any specific religious doctrine.
<LI>Accept Jesus and be saved!
<LI>life, love, compassion, human potential
<LI>I'm agnostic and leave open the possibility of some type of supreme being.  However, I have never seen or heard anything that could possibly be construed as "proof."  I remain open-minded and have absolutely no problem with anyone's beliefs given that those beliefs do no harm. Unfortunately, religious beliefs quite often cause great harm.
<LI>There's something out there, Idon't know what it is yet, some call it GOD.
<LI>"When you are in the service of your fellow beings, you are only in the service of your God."  (Book of Mormon, Mosiah 2:17)
<LI>To know, love and serve God.
<LI>Love the sinner, but hate the sin
<LI>I tend to try to shy away from the term "religion" as it has negative connotations. I do not believe in a list of do's and don'ts, but in a way of life that results from an understanding of who I am... that being an individual who is loved and cared for by a personal God.
<LI>You must be born again. All else is deception.
<LI>Do no Harm!!!!
<LI>I believe in a spiritual way of life, which isn't necessarily religious (as dictated by doctrine), rather by community conscience as a way that a "Higher Power" would express itself.
<LI>Fnord "BoB" in the living universe now.  
<LI>Religion could be much simpler if we chose to follow two rules: judge not that you will be judged and Love one another as you love yourself and love God above all others.  Simple but so many horrible things have been done by creating more rules which then must be followed.
<LI>That we each contain a lifeforce (spirit) that continues on after death. Perhaps we reincarnate, or continue possibly as a spirit entity devoid of any physical self.
<LI>A communal "life-force" in where all things belong.
<LI>Man's selfish desires has told God to leave us alone, and made the earth violent.  Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for our crimes so we could know and love our creator.  If we accept His gift we can experience the love of God.  If we don't we choose to li
<LI>Religion is about laws (check the etymology), Christianity is about freedom in Jesus.
<LI>We are all interconnected and what goes around comes around.
<LI>If it feels right and it does not hurt you or others in any way then do it
<LI>There is a common bridge that links our faiths together. It is God, no matter what He is called. His attributes are the same across all faiths.
<LI>Though I share beliefs with many cnservative Christians, I beleive that many fundementalists are more pharisaical than Christ-like.
<LI>Believe what you want to, but do not force your beliefs on others.
<LI>Jesus died for my sings, rose again, and will return one day to take all those who have believed back to heaven with him.
<LI>religion:  your approach to life, your values, morals, what you base your decisions on
<LI>I feel that no one has all the answers and that it has to be a personal choice.
<LI>I dont' practice religion I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.       
<LI>I am a born-again believer in Jesus Christ. Eternal life is found only in Him.
<LI>If there is a higher power, it is within ourselves.
<LI>Most wars and distress are religion based
<LI>Don't believe anything. Experience.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the Truth, the Way, and the Life.  Selah.
<LI>Religion is the cause of all world problems.
<LI>The second coming of Christ
<LI>Since I am a Christian I believe that Christ lets us make our choices.  If we make the right ones then we will be rewarded for them.  If we make the wrong ones then we have to pay the penalty if God so demands.  I do believe that no one should force their belliefs on others in the name of Christianity as in the case of the Prayer in Schoolers and the Right to Lifers.
<LI>I am a materialist in the philosophical sense of one who denies everything supernatural or transcendant.
<LI>God is one. Names and forms are relative truths only. God alone exists. The innermost essence of mankind and nature is God or the Supreme Self.
<LI>Through the attonement if Jesus Christ I may reconcil myself with my Heavenly Father and return to Him by following the guidance of The Holy Ghost. Helping others is the key to others and "this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"St. John 17:3

<LI>I beleive as long as we treat each other equally and fairly the world will be a batter place.
<LI>here is a thought... The bible is true. Who says so? GOD! where? IN THE BIBLE! hmmm, whats wrong with that!?
<LI>Unable to be reflected in this survey.I respect people who believe differently, but not different beliefs. I am friends with homosexuals, but believe homosexuality is wrong.  We are created, but what is today described in detail as "creationism", is not essential.
<LI>Jesus is the key to happiness and eternal peace.
<LI>Jesus is the ONLY Way.  He said so.
<LI>THE MOST IMPORTANT thing in this life is to come to know Jesus Christ personally.  He came to earth that all people might be saved through him, and He is the only door to salvation/heaven (His claims, not mine).
<LI>God exists, and that fact is the most important thing in life.
<LI>Jesus is Lord and Savior and was crucified and is risen for the sins of the world.
<LI>Live, love, and learn; God is love, God is Truth
<LI>God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
<LI>Christianity is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, who died, was buried, and resurrected from the dead.  He is the only path to Heaven.
<LI>Religion on a personal level is beneficial.  On a societal level it is detremental.
<LI>

<LI>The questions in #13 are a little vague. (Not my philosphy) ;-)
<LI>all your gods are childish, tempermental children. Your idea of heaven is my idea of hell. Since the beginning of time the "Church" whichever that may be, has murdered more people than any other single entity.
<LI>Hey man, remember the Force from Star Wars, the power (energy) that binds all of us (the universe) together...stuff like that.
<LI>Being catholic is how I am most comfortable worshipping God.  It has been a great comfort to me in troubled times, but I know that there are many paths to salvation and happiness, so I would not begrudge anyone their beliefs.
<LI>I believe that only one reality can be true and I believe that I am honestly seeking that which is true.
<LI>Jesus Christ, our Lord and savior came to earth as a man, died on a cross for our sins and went to be with the Father.  I am a saved sinner, imperfect, but loved by God.
<LI>I do it for me, not for a God.
<LI>jesu shed his blood and died for my sins
<LI>In regard to the societal significance of religion:  I think it depends on the religion, some are constructive, some destructive.
<LI>We are subject to spiritual laws that we are still discovering.
<LI>As human beings we have free will to make choices about our lives. Our belief and faith helps us to make those choices.  I don't believe our lives are 'mapped' out for us, we are agents of free will.
<LI>I am created by God. From dust to dust.
<LI>Love God and he help you.
<LI>the universe is the highest divinity, a cosmic balance we are all a part (small) of
<LI>All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, but through his son, Jesus Christ, we can have eternal life.  Without him, we are lost.
<LI>Maybe there's a god. More likely there's one in each of us. Organized religion is ALWAYS bad in some way, even if the church in question doesn't happen to be killing anyone in the name of its central structure of lies.
<LI>Long before Christianity was brought into western culture, there was no word "religion" because what you believed in you lived every day.  Each person lives according to their own beliefs and because each person is unique they will have different beliefs.  This is necessary because it is not possible for one single belief system to encompass all of what creation is.  There is no wrong religion, there is no one true religion.  Each individual is merely a reflection of what God is, therefore that person'
 beliefs are what is true.
<LI>Maybe there's a god. More likely there's one in each of us. Organized religion is ALWAYS bad in some way, even if the church in question doesn't happen to be killing anyone in the name of its central structure of lies.
<LI>Religion has maintained order in society for Millenium, though not religious, I feel religion prevents some culture from fall into total chaos.
<LI>I am a rather liberal-thinking priest in a rather liberal-thinking church: the American Catholic Church, an Old Catholic body.
<LI>I'm Christian, and I try (unsuccessfully) to folow Jesus' example.
<LI>jesus christ is the truth the way and the light
<LI>All people all valuable and we should live and let live.
<LI>Religion is nothing; knowing Jesus Christ is everything.  We are not saved by works, but by faith in Jesus and His death and resurrection, by which we can receive eternal life as a free gift (not by any of our works!).
<LI>Life is the result of random chance in a universe that has no creator.  Self-consciousness is a product of natural selection.
<LI>I believe in rational self-interest. I have no morality but what I impose on myself, and I live (and will die) by my morality.
<LI>Islam is the religion of peace and total submission to the commandments of God.
<LI>I think all religions are cults, and as such they can be either great or horrible or neutral.
<LI>Religion is the result of the masses' search for meaning.
<LI>Religion is a concept used to control the  massses
<LI>God is in a form that is hard for us to understand.  Most Religions come from the same core, which is love God, love your neighbor, and love yourself.
<LI>Believe in god for he will save you from all evils.

<LI>Scientology is a practical, daily applicable, effective applied religion.
<LI>I believe somewhat in the alien theory. That we possibly could be an offspring of a prior civilization. Although creationism isn't totally out of the question. Neither is evolution for that matter. Even someone as smart as einstein could not possibly know until you die and to believe otherwise is just stupidity.
<LI>I do not dicount the posability of their being a god but I have seen no evidence to that fact and I do not actively persue religion. I do however beleve that the ten commandments are great "guidelines" for a happy life.
<LI>I wouldnt slam a person with opposing views but I would try to quietly change them.

<LI>Religion is a personal thing for me. I don't follow specified religious guidlines, only my personal ones.
<LI>Religion seems to be an easy place to turn for those who cant decide on morals, values and opions for themselves.
<LI>You should incorporate values that you respect into your belief system, and not be afraid to wonder about those that don't convince you.
<LI>Man created God in his own image.
<LI>I'll find out when I'm dead.  No point in worrying about it now.  Most important, it is personal.  Anyone who tries to impose their religon on me should be shot, drawn, quartered, burnned, and then really hurt.  
<LI>Christianity is one of several religions and by no means is there a right or supreme religion. With the Christian Coalition, they are messing with the first amendment rights given to people who practice other religions.
<LI>If the bible were truly the work of an omnipotend creator, she would have done a better job of warning us of hazzards. None of this mumb-jumbo about the number of the beast, no contraditins, but clear indications that killing cats increases Plague, hating thise who are idfferent is dangerous.  Much miserey has been caused by religion.
