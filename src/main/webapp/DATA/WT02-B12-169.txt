Affirmative Action and Official English</h2>

<ul>


<p>

<u>Affirmative Action</u>.  On December 23, 1996, a San Francisco

federal judge blocked enforcement of Proposition 209, saying in a 67-page

opinion that there is a "strong probability" that opponents will show that the

anti-affirmative action measure is an unconstitutional violation of the equal

protection clause of the Constitution.  According to civil rights groups,

Proposition 209 violates the equal protection guarantees by preventing women

and minorities from seeking government programs to remedy discrimination that

remain available to others, including veterans and the aged, unless that can

get another constitutional amendment approved by voters.  <p>

In other words, if veterans or athletes can still have preference for jobs

or university admissions by law and regulation, the court must decide if

eliminating preferences for women and minorities in the state's constitution is

a violation of the US Constitution.<p>

<u>Official English</u>.  On December 4, 1996, the US Supreme Court heard

arguments on a case, Arizonans for Official English, to determine whether

Article 28, an amendment to Arizona's Constitution, approved by voters in 1988,

can prevent a state employee from speaking a language other than English on the

job, except when teaching English and dealing with crime and similar

emergencies (Arizonans for Official English v Arizona, 95-974).<p>

The US Supreme Court must first decide whether Arizonans for Official

English has standing to bring the case and then, whether English-speaking

requirement violates the free speech rights of state employees. <p>

The Arizona trial court found that the amendment violated the free speech

rights of a bilingual employee who chose to write her reports in Spanish.  The

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling in a 6 to 5 vote.<p>

In one precedent, Meyer v Nebraska, 1923, the Supreme Court overturned a

state law that prohibited the teaching of German even in private

schools.<p>

There are 23 states and 40 cities that have official English statutes,

although most are symbolic.  A 1995 poll found that 73 percent of US voters

want to make English the official language of the US.<p>

According to the 1990 Census of Population, 14 percent of US residents aged

five and over speak a language other than or in addition to English at home--

seven percent of those born in the United States, many of whom are the children

of immigrants, and 80 percent of the foreign-born.  Of those speaking a foreign

language, 55 percent speak Spanish.  <p>

Barry Chiswick estimates that foreign-born men of the same age and

education have about 20 percent lower earnings if they speak English poorly

than if they are more fluent.<p>
