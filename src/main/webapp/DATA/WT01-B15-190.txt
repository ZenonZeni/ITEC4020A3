<body><strong>Sources of Program Funding </strong>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management receives program funding from three
sources: the Nuclear Waste Fund, the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriation, and the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Research and Development Account. 
<p>
<strong>Ratepayer Dollars for  Civilian Waste    </strong>
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Fund was created by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982. The
Fund, composed of payments made  by the generators and owners of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste, was established to ensure that the costs of carrying out activities relating to 
the disposal of these materials will be  borne by the persons responsible for generating them [Sec.
111(b)(4), NWPA].  
<p>
The Fund is held in the Treasury of the United States, but is managed and administered by the Department of Energy. The NWPA requires that the budget of the Nuclear Waste Fund be submitted to Congress triennially, along with the Departmental budget submitted at that time. In actual practice, however, the Department  has submitted an annual budget for the 
Nuclear Waste Fund, and Congress has  made annual appropriations from the Fund for expenditures to support activities mandated by the NWPA. Amounts in this Fund not appropriated for expenditure are invested by the Department in U.S.  Treasury securities.  
<p>
<strong>Fees </strong>
<p>
The NWPA provides for two types of fees: an ongoing fee of 1 mill (one tenth of a cent) per
kilowatt-hour of electricity generated and sold on or after April 7, 1983 <cite>1</cite>, and a one-time fee for
electricity generated prior to April 7, 1983. Utilities have three payment options for the one-time
fee: (1) pay in 40 quarterly installments with accrued  interest, (2) pay in a lump sum with 
accrued interest prior to the first scheduled delivery of spent fuel to the Department of Energy for
disposal, or (3) pay in  a lump sum prior to June 30, 1985, with  no interest. These fees are incorporated
into the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste,
promulgated as a Federal rule in 1983, which establishes the responsibilities and rights of the
Department and the owners and generators of  the spent nuclear fuel and high-level  radioactive
waste. The NWPA provides for an annual assessment of the adequacy of the 1-mill/kWh disposal
fee. In the event that the fee is determined to be inadequate or excessive, the Secretary of Energy
is to propose a  fee adjustment to Congress. Annual appropriations to the program from the Nuclear
Waste Fund are currently considered to be discretionary appropriations subject to the
discretionary spending caps established by law. This has resulted in substantial underfunding for the program.

<strong>Assets  </strong>
<p>
Nuclear Waste Fund<cite> 2</cite> assets as of September 30, 1995, included investments with a net book
value of $5.1 billion, receivables related to ongoing quarterly fees of $149.4 million, receivables from
one-time fees of $881 million, cumulative accrued interest on one-time fees of $1,084 million, 
and receivables for interest from investments of $105 million.  In addition, the accrued Department of
Energy liability for defense waste disposal costs paid from the Fund, including interest, totals $1.1 billion. 
<p>
<strong>Expenditures </strong>
<p>
Cumulative expenses paid from the Nuclear Waste Fund, including direct appropriations to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the former
Monitored Retrievable Storage Commission, and the former Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, from
inception of the program through the period ending September 30, 1995, were $4.5 billion. 
<p>
<strong>Taxpayer Dollars for  Defense Wastes </strong>
<p>
On April 30, 1985, the President determined that defense high-level waste should be disposed of
in the civilian  repository. On August 20, 1987, the  Department of Energy published in the <em>Federal
Register</em> the method to be used  in calculating the share of total waste  management system costs
allocable to  the disposal of defense high-level radioactive waste. The defense share of total
system life-cycle cost was estimated to  be $6.4 billion in 1994 dollars in the last  published (September
1995) total system life-cycle cost estimate. Costs incurred for defense waste disposal activities
through September 30, 1995, were $1.5 billion, including principal and interest. The  Department
of Energy made two payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund: $5 million in fiscal year 1991, and
$7.5 million in fiscal year 1992. Beginning in fiscal year 1993, the Congress established  a separate
Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriation, in lieu of direct  payment by the Department into
the Nuclear Waste Fund. $100 million was  appropriated for fiscal year 1993, $120 million for
fiscal year 1994, $129.4 million for fiscal year 1995 and $248.4 million for fiscal year 1996. These
funds are not deposited into the Nuclear Waste Fund, but are available for use by the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management to carry out activities pursuant to the NWPA. <p><b>Civilian
Radioactive Waste Research and Development Account</b><p>The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management also administers the Civilian Radioactive Waste Research and  Development account. Like the
Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriation, this account consists of appropriations from
general taxpayer revenues. It is  used to carry out generic research, development, and demonstration
activities authorized by Title II of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  The fiscal year 1996 Energy Supply
Research and Development Appropriation provides no funding for this account.
 <p>
<strong><h4>Program Revenues</h4></strong>
<p>
As of September 30, 1995, the Nuclear Waste Fund's accrued revenue from ongoing fees was approximately $6.0 billion. Accrued revenue from one-time fees, including interest, was approximately $3.4 billion. In addition, the Nuclear Waste Fund had earned approximately $2.4 billion from investments in Treasury securities. Total accrued revenue from defense atomic
energy activities, including principal and interest,  is approximately $1.5 billion. Total accrued revenue from
all sources, including Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriations, is approximately $13.3
billion.
<hr>
<cite>1</cite> On December 6, 1985, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the
ongoing 1-mill-per-kilowatt-hour fee should be based on net generation rather than gross
generation of electricity. As a result, the Department of Energy refunded approximately $48
million in principal and interest payments to the utilities.
<p>
On March 17, 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the
interpretation of "net electricity generated... and sold" should include only electricity that is both
generated and actually sold. Accordingly, the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear
Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste was amended on December 31, 1991, to reflect the
decision of the Court. Credits were provided against future utility payments as appropriate to
compensate for previous overpayments.
