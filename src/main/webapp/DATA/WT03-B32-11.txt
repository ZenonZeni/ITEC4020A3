TIME WARNER SELLS ARCADE UNIT

     Time Warner Inc. continued its slash and burn campaign against
its new media units by selling its Milpitas, Calif.-based Time
Warner Interactive division to WMS Industries Inc., owner of
coin-operated games company Williams Entertainment.

     The deal, for an undisclosed sum, brings together two of the
largest U.S. arcade developers; the TWI division has found recent
coin-op success with "Primal Rage," "Area 51" and "T-MEK," while
Williams Entertainment is known for its popular "Mortal Kombat"
series, "NBA Jam," "Terminator 2" and "Killer Instinct."  It also
adds another chapter to the ownership history of Time Warner
Interactive, which began as Atari Corp. before splitting off into
Atari Games Corp. a few years later.  It was then called Time
Warner Interactive and now reverts back to the Atari Games Corp.
name.

     Time Warner has been looking to reduce its large debt for
months, and last October the media giant shuffled its Burbank,
Calif.-based Time Warner Interactive unit and WarnerActive under
the iNSCAPE umbrella, a joint venture between Michael Nash, HBO and
Warner Music Group.

     The Burbank office focused on creating CD-ROM games and
Internet properties, while the much larger Milpitas division
developed arcade titles which it leveraged for home video game
systems.  In 1995, it released five coin-op titles and 30 CD-ROM
games.

     Reports first circulated that the Atari Games division was on
the block last December, with Acclaim Entertainment Inc. listed as
a possible bidder.  But WMS returns Atari Games to its roots in the
coin-op world, and the deal is expected to close within two months. 
While strategy is being formulated, both companies have found
success by translating hit arcade titles to home gaming platforms. 
Williams formerly had a licensing deal with Acclaim to port its
titles to the home, but now develops the versions in-house and
distributes through GT Interactive.  Atari Games recently launched
multiple versions of Primal Rage, and is set to release home
versions of T-MEK this spring.

     There is no word whether WMS will move the 300-person Atari
Games Corp. out of the Silicon Valley or if layoffs are planned,
but WMS officials said growing its coin-op business was a main
motivator behind the purchase.  WMS reported revenues of $385
million last year and income of $19 million.

     WMS can be reached at (312) 961-1111; Atari Games, at (408)
232-3213.

ROCKET SCIENCE CEO DISCUSSES REPOSITIONING THRUST

     SAN FRANCISCO -- Rocket Science President and Chief Executive
Officer Steve Blank was quite frank about the company's
restructuring efforts at the "Staying Alive:  Reinventing Your
Company" session held at intermediaWorld in San Francisco the first
week of March.  Blank said the company has been through some
"interesting shifts in the last three years," when it began
corporate life as a game console developer.

     Rocket Science was founded in July 1993 (EGN, Feb. 19, p. 5),
and was positioned as a great technology and graphics company. 
That was a time when the "hype of multimedia and Hollywood meeting
in Silicon Valley was at its zenith," Blank said.  The reality was,
however, that "the company was not a multimedia company, but an
entertainment company in a hits-driven business."

     In addition, while the company was founded on spectacular
technology, "that did not default into great games," Blank said. 
Compounding the overall problem, according to Blank, "was a poor
choice of platforms to develop for."  The result was that Rocket
Science "produced weak games, with abysmal game play."

     The irony was that Rocket Science had hired great talent from
Hollywood effects and graphics communities, but their component
skill sets did not translate well into a game company environment.

     Blank said that Rocket Science went through a period of
re-evaluation, and put together a 12-step program for reviving the
company.  Rocket Science then committed to making major
repositioning and structural changes.  Blank said the company is
"now in the process of sitting and executing, and executing very
hard."  He quipped that employees of Rocket Science all wear
buttons around their work spaces that reflect the company's new
operating philosophy:  "It's the Game, Stupid."

     Rocket Science also initiated an intense prototype process
that takes place before any art is submitted.  Blank said that
funding the repositioning plan was made complicated by the fact
that "the game console market has  collapsed dramatically over the
past two years."  The problem for Rocket Science and other game
developers is that fixing companies takes time and money.  But,
according to Blank, "multimedia is no longer a play for venture
capitalists.  Its an entertainment business."

     That means that Rocket Science had to "reposition the company
where the money is."  Blank said that the "money in the business is
now riding on three waves of platforms:  consoles, PCs and the
Internet."

     Despite the company's market travails, Blank said this is his
sixth start-up, four of which have gone public, an option that
could be in the cards for Rocket Science.  The company's Firewalker
3D tool (developed in conjunction with Silicon Graphics Inc.;
story, p. 4) is now coming to market, and dynamics of the Internet
appear to offer game developers a strong vehicle for maximizing the
value of established game titles.  Blank believes that Rocket
Science finally realized that what the company had to deliver was
what the market was asking for.  The market always rules, according
to Blank.

MAXIS SUPPORT BY PHONE IS AROUND THE CLOCK

     It's 4:30 a.m. and SimCity's citizens are about to burn down
the courthouse because the command needed to lower taxes won't
work.  This sounds like a job for SimCity publisher Maxis and its
24-hour support line.

     Were it one year ago, they would not have been able to call
the number.  Digital Robespierres and Dantons would have burned the
city to the ground because Maxis' support number was responsive
only Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

     Maxis realized that 12 support employees working 12 hours a
day, five days a week simply was not enough, but the company could
not afford to have support staff on duty around the clock. 
Originally, Maxis combined its technical support and customer
service departments, and even brought in temporary help, but that
still was not enough.

     Enter IntelliSystems.  Intelli-Systems breezed into the
support center at Walnut Park, Calif., from Reno; it's an automatic
Interactive Expert System designed to answer and solve most
troubleshooting calls coming into a support center.

     Maxis' finances ought to show how successful automation has
been:  savings since the installation in December 1994 and
September 1995 was close to $58,000.

     The IntelliSystem program contains its knowledge in a
centralized base that customers can access via telephone, fax,
local access network or modem.  It can answer most calls because
the majority of questions result from problems frequently
encountered.

     What makes IntelliSystem especially convenient is that callers
can ring up, get the answer to a problem, save the call with the
program, hang up, try the solution and then call back.

     Maxis Customer Support Manager Roger Johnsen said that a
caller still can choose between a human or computer during normal
hours.

     "If I have a choice, I want the customer to speak to a support
representative," Johnsen said.  "IntelliSystem provides an
excellent backup for peak periods.  Amazingly enough, people will
opt for automation when they have the choice."

     Other companies that use IntelliSystem include Digital
Equipment Corp., Adobe Systems and Virgin Interactive.

     Maxis' public relations can be reached at (203) 321-1242.  The
Maxis support line is (510) 927-3905.  Answers typically average
five minutes.

SILICON STUDIO UNVEILS FireWalker

     Silicon Studio Inc., a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics Inc.,
unleashed FireWalker, an authoring system designed to enable
professional title developers to create interactive
three-dimensional titles for multiple playback platforms.  The
studio began working with Rocket Science Games (see story, p. 2) on
the technology approximately one year ago, and their first
commercial game from the alliance, "Ganymede," is expected to debut
in December for the Sony PlayStation, and in the first quarter of
1997 for personal computers.

     "As a company committed to creatively pushing the envelope, we
needed a powerful authoring environment that allows us to focus on
compelling content and head-spinning game play," said Steve Blank,
co-founder, chief executive officer and president of Rocket
Science.  Argonaut Technologies Ltd. joined in the party, too, when
it announced March 4 Silicon Studio had licensed its BRender
three-dimensional rendering software and would integrate it into
the FireWalker products.

     Sega Enterprises Ltd., Time Warner Interactive, SegaSoft and
MediaX/Toonsmiths for the Grolier Interactive product "Surf and
Destroy," will participate in the FireWalker Alpha Test Program.

     FireWalker allows title designers to "drag and drop" an
element directly into the title and position elements in scenes
without programming.  The software also supports dynamic access of
title elements over the World Wide Web for authoring and playback. 
The complete system is expected to cost approximately $1,000 for a
single-seat license with no royalty fees.

     Silicon Graphics also said March 4 that its line of work
stations will run game programming tools for developing titles for
video game consoles.  Sega's development tools division, Cross
Products Ltd., and Sony's game authoring division, Psygnosis Ltd.,
said they would use Silicon's tools for the Sega Saturn and Sony
PlayStation, respectively.

     Nintendo has been developing titles with SGI's game platform
for approximately one year and plans on using it for the Nintendo
64.  Nintendo's 64-bit system uses a MIPS microprocessor from MIPS
Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics.

     But wait, Silicon Graphics didn't stop there.  It also
announced an alliance with Apple Computer Inc. to accelerate the
development of digital studios for feature film, animation and
broadcast video.  Silicon Studios said it will support Apple's
QuickTime technology in its new StudioCentral asset management
system which delivers capabilities such as cataloging, real-time
browsing and data archiving.

     Silicon Graphics can be reached at (415) 933-6088 or
http://www.sgi.com; Rocket Science, at  (213) 938-7600 or

ONLINE PREDICTED AS THE FUTURE OF INTERACTIVE GAMES

By Paul Palumbo, West Coast Editor

     SAN FRANCISCO -- The Software Publishers Association (SPA)
sponsored an afternoon session, "Online Interactive Games:  Issues
for Developers and Services," that brought together a distinguished
group of developer and network service providers who preached that
the new world money order is going to be online games.

     While every company thinks its future is interactive gaming,
the questions of when and how publishers go about getting there
remain points of discussion.

     Panelists were Johnny Wilson, Computer Gaming World; William
Simpson, The Dreamers' Guild; Neil Harris, vice president for
marketing at Simultronics Corp. (Gemstone 3); Daniel Goldman, Total
Entertainment Network; Brian Moriarity, MPath; and Sheryl Gotto,
Kesmai Corp.

     Some of the issues discussed during the session included the
evolution of economic models (free, pay for turn, pay for time and
flat-rate pricing tiers), taking a game online or directly to the
Web, the various development models (for example, underwritten by
an online service for an advance paid against royalties) and what
the technology model allows publishers to provide online today. 
The audience was mostly game developers and online service
representatives.

What's Available

     The presentation began with an overview of what actually is
available today online.  Those types of games are mostly free for
downloading by electronic mail, and have no real business model
attached because there are no revenues generated.  There are,
however, also "play for turn" games, whereby charges vary from a
low of about $2 per turn to as high as $10 per turn.  According to
the speakers, those types of games will benefit from CyberCash and
DigiCash services because the transactions are relatively small.

     The consensus, however, was that the real money to be made is
found in the "pay for time," or real-time telecommunications
connections genre.  And those types of services will come to
fruition over providers such as The Total Entertainment Network and
Mpath's network.

     Kesmai Corp. representative Sheryl Gotto said her company does
not produce any games that don't have an online capability.  "All
of Kesmai's games are developed from the network out," she said. 
The company's titles include "AirWarrior BattleTech" and "The
Realms Of Kesmai."

     Gotto described the design characteristics in wide area
network (WAN) games vs. their boxed counterparts.  "If CD-ROMs are
like movies, then online behaves more like a soap opera because the
content has to constantly evolve," she said.  Kesmai always has
used a "pay per second" model, but is going to flat-rate pricing. 
She said that it was an "interesting dilemma for a service that is
resource-intensive."  It's a double-edged sword because "flat-rate
pricing tiers attract more people, but the costs to provision are
higher because of telecom charges."  She went on to suggest that
"multiplayer games are going to become a dominant part of the
industry," and that any provider "can't forget about the
maintenance aspect of the game."

     She cautioned that "once the game is released, that's just the
beginning."

No Burn-Out

     Daniel Goldman, chairman and president of San Francisco-based
Total Entertainment Network, said that "multiplayer gaming is a lot
more compelling because players don't burn out on it because the
user base is constantly changing, as opposed to a single player
playing a PC [personal computer] or game box."  He also said that
customer service is one of the biggest costs, but it's also a
necessity because "so much of a network's success is going to be
based on word of mouth."  Goldman also said that competition is not
the only element that attracted players to online, "it's also
cooperation and chat functions," he said.  One of the company's
major design thrusts is to minimize the impact of latency on games
and gaming.

     William Simpson of The Dreamers' Guild said that his company
is working with Microsoft Network, where the company exclusively
provisions its "Skulls, Bones and Buccaneers," "Online Baseball,"
"PlanetNet" and "Warlords of the Apocalypse" titles.  Simpson also
said that the "nature of the conduit is a major issue."

     He noted that "unpredictability of the latency on the Web and
its duration" are key issues.

Never Alone?

     Game designer Brian Moriarity of Mpath said that people like
the Web "because it satisfies the need not to be alone.  But today
it is a lonely experience."  He predicted, however, that "soon the
Web will begin to notice you."  And when that happens, the "Web
will become conversational, and therefore interactive."  Moriarity
said that there are two real uses for the Web:

     1.  Conversation.

     2.  Interactive, multiplayer games.

     He predicted that some day online games "will challenge, and
eventually eclipse single-player games."  But what is necessary is
an adequate network, sufficient users, and sufficient processing
power.  He said that what developers have been waiting for is a
chance to build the games, and an opportunity to find the poker
partners to fund  these projects.

     What will change the dynamic for online publishers, he said,
is the "first big online hit."  In the not-too-distant future, an
online game "will become so popular that the network will be
threatened with collapse because of intense user interest."

     Moriarity maintains that all publishers then will scramble to
duplicate it.  He further said that that big online hit probably
will reach beyond the enthusiast segments.  For example, millions
of people liked Trivial Pursuit and the Rubick's Cube.  He said he
believes that the game will have to be "simple to play, but
difficult to solve in totality."

10 Ways to Lose

     Neil Harris, vice president of marketing for Simultronics,
closed out the spirited session by listing the Top 10 Rules for
Losing Money Online:

     10.  Use repurposed content from another medium.

     9.  Don't use investors or partners.

     8.  Use PCs as servers.

     7.  Do exclusive deals with distribution sources and networks.

     6.  Focus on the newest technology.

     5.  Ship it and then forget about it.

     4.  Automate everything (no systems operators or live
technical support).

     3.  Focus on games with definite beginnings and endings.

     2.  Flat-rate pricing.

     1.  Don't provide users with communications capabilities.

     While there was disagreement among the panelists about the
impact of online distribution on retail and distribution, everybody
agreed that a major component of those boxed assets will be
digital.  Moriarity said that "everything that is produced should
be designed to be downloaded, because there is a chance to
transcend CD-ROM and packaging."  He also said that "the
convenience and economics of online distribution are irresistible."

     That implies a profound social contract with customers. 
Suppliers will be handling customers directly, not through
intermediaries.  They will have to respect privacy and anonymity,
treat adults like adults, and give parents the tools they need to
make informed decisions for their children.

     Beyond that, the panelists said, the most productive thing
suppliers of online games can do is get out of the way and let the
customer play.  Customers will be attracted to games that offer the
highest level of presence, with suppliers keeping low profiles.

REVISITING INDECENCY ONLINE

     Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) introduced the Online Parental Control
Act of 1996 (OPCA) March 14 to put the onus of child access to sex
and violence on the Internet in the hands of parents and guardians
instead of the federal government.

     The OPCA would replace the term "indecency" standard of the
1934 Telecommunications Act with "harmful to minors."  It also
would establish a definition for that phrase.  In addition, the
OPCA would:

     *    Maintain the Communications Act of 1934's legal defenses
against liability for people who choose to give parents technology
that blocks or restricts access to online materials deemed obscene
or harmful to minors and restricts access to such materials through
adult access codes or credit card numbers.

     *    Add two new defenses:  the use of labeling or segregating
systems to restrict access to online materials, such as systems
developed using the standards designed by the Platform for Internet
Content Selection project (PICS) and the use of other systems that
serve the same function of the other defenses if they are as
reasonable, effective and appropriate as blocking, adult access
code and labeling technologies.

     *    Protect providers or users of interactive computer
services, information content providers and access software
providers from civil or criminal liability under state law for
making available to minors materials that are indecent or harmful
to minors if they take actions to qualify for the defenses
mentioned above.

     "I'd rather have Mom and Dad monitoring their children's
online viewing habits than the government," Eshoo said, echoing a
view shared by many in the online industry.  "Technology offers the
best opportunity for parents to manage what their kids have access
to, and the OPCA encourages those technologies to be developed more
fully."

Internet Rating System

     SafeSurf, an online parents' organization that assisted in
forming an Internet rating system, joined Eshoo to promote the
acceptance of her newly introduced the telecommunications
amendment.

     "I believe that technological solutions, such as the SafeSurf
rating system, give parents the tools they need to protect their
children without sacrificing our country's First Amendment rights,"
Eshoo said.

RUNNING OUT OF CASTLES

     The Nintendo folks knew they couldn't send Mario, Luigi, et
al. through the fantasy world of castles and magic for too much
longer, so they send Mario, Luigi, Vinnie and all of Bugsy Siegel's
other bruisers through Las Vegas in the Gameboy version of their
NES release "Vegas Stakes."

     With $1,000 in the player's pocket, the first task is to
master five luck games and get into the members-only casino where
the minimum bet is $1,000 - and that's the only rule.

     Winners will get the $10 million the casino has been
"reluctant to part with."

     Released last week, "Vegas Stakes" has been set at a retail
price of $34.95.

     Nintendo of America can be reached at (213) 623-4200 or (206)

TOP GUN, Fire at Will

     Published and Developed by, Spectrum Holobyte Inc.

     DOS; $50

     Ten years after Tom Cruise's I'm-too-sexy-for-my-cockpit cool
made women swoon and men dream of downing Libyan aircraft, Spectrum
Holobyte Inc. has released a "Top Gun" CD-ROM game that a spokesman
said is not so much a flight simulator as it is an "action flying
game."  But the action doesn't come into play until long after the
player has mastered the flight controls.

     Three reasons to leave this mostly uninteresting game on the
shelf:

     1)   Windows 95 Installation - If installed for play in MS-DOS
mode, it reboots the computer before and after game play.  If
installed for play in a DOS window in Windows 95, the video and
audio can be "choppy."  Annoying on both counts.

     2)   Testosterone Level - Too high in some respects, such as
the co-pilot's adolescent sense of humor, and too low in others,
such as the speed of action (e.g., far too much time is spent
waiting for takeoff).

     3)   Music - A cover of Kenny Loggins' "Danger Zone."  Ad
nauseam.  'Nuff said.  RL

CIVILIZATION II

     Published and Developed by Microprose

     Windows, DOS, Macintosh; $49

     Long before "Myst" "became your world," Microprose was
creating the most comprehensive strategy game anywhere. 
"Civilization II" is the long-awaited update of its popular
world-building game.

     Much has been improved since "Civ I."  The new interface is
excellent for managing complex data, and there are myriad
customizable features, including the gender of the player (a nice
PC - politically correct, mind you - touch).  Players familiar with
older versions may be shocked by the new hexagonal mapping. 
Annoyingly, there still is no option to quit to a main menu.  Setup
is relatively trouble-free, although users should opt for the
"maximum" hard disk requirements.

     This game is not for the give-em-hell "Doom" crowd.  It
requires patience and has a steep learning curve - and if the
player learns the tricks of making friends and enemies,
"Civilization II" will require more decisions than any reasonable
despot can handle.  But it is accessible enough for novices to
learn during play - with help from the manual, of course, which
reads like a good history textbook.  Like the original, this game
is addictive.  Matt Petrillo

PIPER

     Published and Developed by Splash Studios Inc.

     Windows 3.1, 95; $39.95

     There's only one way to sum it up:  This is the Pied Piper of
Hamelin Town, mysteriously moved to the Old West.  Rats, led by
Mephisto, a monstrous puppet that will scare off its intended
audience rather than simply revolt them, spread across the gold
rush town of Midas Valley in numbers that could rival Nosferatu's
horde.

     Not surprisingly, a mysterious, dandified flautist appears out
of nowhere with intentions to con, but ends up a hero.  It's not
original, but what fun is here is in the fact that your kids will
get a kick out of using the mouse and you will think, "Geez, it's
pretty neat what they put on computers nowadays!"

     The role of the piper is played by White Mighty Morphin Power
Ranger Jason David Frank, who will make the little girls pant and
the little boys gag.

     Executive Producer Patrick Ford said this is the most
ambitious studio project for CD-ROM ever made.  This is an
ambitious project, but then again, so was "Heaven's Gate."  RM

THE HIVE

     Published by Trimark Interactive;

     Developed by Rainbow America

     Windows 95; $39.95

     The graphics in "The Hive" are stellar and most any player
should appreciate its keen sense of detail.  Learn to love the
graphics, though.  First, because they're great, second because
players see the same thing repeatedly.  However, trigger-happy
gamers will be pleased by "The Hive."  It's the player's job to
shoot first, don't bother asking questions, shoot some more.

     The plot requires a user to protect the galaxy from the evil
Mob, which plans to cause a major setback (to put it mildly) for
mankind by using genetically engineered creatures to create an
ultrafatal toxin.  While one or two plots or plans may come to mind
as a means to counter the Mobster, "Hive" developers would have the
player solve the problems by cremating everything in sight, and
then some.

     One of the first titles to be created for the Windows 95
operating system, "The Hive" does makes the most of it.  However,
Trimark Interactive parent Trimark Holdings said in January that it
"took a significant reserve" for the "Hive," which is part of the
reason it reported its first quarterly loss in history.  Although
the company initially shipped more than 120,000 units of the game,
retail sales were negatively affected "by the dramatically
smaller-than-projected installed user base of the operating
system," according to the company.  SM

SPYCRAFT:  The Great Game

     Published by Activision

     DOS, Windows 95; $49.95

     It's tempting to dismiss any game that boasts a former CIA
director and former KGB major general on the development team, but
"Spycraft" manages to weave together an entertaining tale of
international intrigue through techno-puzzles and the occasional
gunfight.

     A players begins the game as a CIA operative put in charge of
a mounting crisis:  an assassin has targeted the U.S. president on
the eve of his historic trip to Russia to sign a total nuclear
disarmament treaty.  The action shuttles between CIA headquarters
in Langley, Md., and sites around Moscow, as the player hunts down
the assassin from clues left around his previous attack on a
Russian presidential candidate and the murder of a top CIA
operative in the United States.

     Two of the best features of this title are the acting and the
interface.  Clever video shots and simple directorial touches
actually make this game seem like a TV movie at times, which is an
accomplishment for this industry.  The PDA interface, a common tool
among interactive movies, lets the player catch on video and audio
e-mail messages, check the news, search through the archives of
various government agencies and even link to the Internet for clues
(although, only on the Windows 95 version).  DA

ANGEL DEVOID

     Published by Mindscape Inc.

     DOS, Mac; $35

     For every annoying item that plagues "Angel Devoid" as an
interactive movie there is something equally good that shines
through to make this a promising game - but in the end you can't
build half a glider and expect it to fly.  In this case, Mindscape
has created a first-person sci-fi mystery with many of the same
features that made "Under a Killing Moon" from Access Software both
a success and a failure.

     "Angel Devoid" borrows liberally from cult classic
"Bladerunner" to set the dark and seedy mood of this not-so-bright
future.  Beginning the game as Jake Hard, a disgruntled cop on the
cyberbeat, the player swaps identities (and faces) with
arch-terrorist Angel Devoid after being on the losing end of a
high-speed chase.  The rest of the game involves finding the real
Angel Devoid while sidestepping the legions of cops and crooks that
are out for blood.

     While the story is a cut above the usual cheesy scripts,
navigating the multiple lines of play and various endings is a
tiring process, even with the helpful hints from Jake's PDA. 
Whereas "Under a Killing Moon" packed its scenes with many possible
interactions, "Angel Devoid" ends up as an interactive story in
which the action unfolds around the character instead of the
character really participating in events.  DA

real-time rendering technology with TopGun, 7th Level's proprietary
development and playback tool, we will have one of the most
flexible, multiplatform, multimedia development tools in the
industry," said George Grayson, chairman and Chief Executive Office
of 7th Level.  "This will further strengthen 7th Level's internal
title and tools development." 

     True3D will be included in the retail version of the TopGun
tools package, expected to ship in late 1996.  "Now that more
people have a lot more powerful computers and Windows 95 has opened
up a lot of doors, I think we'll see teen and adult-oriented games
using a lot of 3-D, real-time technology," David Henkel, 7th Level
Chief Operating Office said.  However, he added, "I think we'll
still see a lot of 2-D.  Education products lend themselves to that
type of environment."

     PyroTechnix has various unannounced True3D licensing and
videogame development deals with several media-entertainment
companies for projects on Windows and Sony PlayStation platforms. 
The first fruit of those alliances, a first-person science fiction
strategy title, is expected to be demonstrated at E3 this May in
Los Angeles.

     "7th Level is building the kind of marketing and product line
up that can significantly expand PyroTechnix's technologies and
expertise into broader markets," said Sinjin Bain, president of the
privately-held company.  "In addition, by linking our technologies
with 7th Level's, we hope to create an industry standard for
real-time 3-D rendering."  PyroTechnix will retain its name and
remain in Cincinnati.  In addition, senior management and employees
will continue with the company.

     7th Level can be reached at (214) 498-8184.

AT&T'S ImagiNation RUNS WILD

     AT&T Corp. said it plans to divest its online gaming service
ImagiNation Network (INN) as part of the telecommunications giant's
plan to refocus its business model on transport and away from
content, the company announced March 6.  

     "AT&T's services such as Interchange ... and the ImagiNation
Network are being spun off in favor of services such as WorldNet,"
said Jonathan Erb, vice president of sales and marketing at
ImagiNation.  "Like most telecommunications companies, they
realized that content is not something that they are necessarily
good at."

     ImagiNation currently is looking for partners or investors to
help it continue its business.  AT&T may stay on as a minority
investor, according to Erb.  "I wouldn't be surprised if they did
remain a part of IN, it's a good learning ground."  Merrill Lynch
has been hired by AT&T to help package the network for alliances
and investment.

     "The divestiture is a good opportunity for IN.  We can go
beyond relying on AT&T to help us acquire customers.  We can go to
potential partners and offer them quick-to-market games," said Erb. 
He pointed out that, although the major commercial online services
do quite well at acquiring new members, "there's a pretty shallow
offering of high-quality games," such as tournaments that bring
gamers back to the site repeatedly.  Although no deals have been
made, Erb said, "MCI, Microsoft, AOL [America Online Inc.] and
Internet service providers are all good examples of companies that
would be good to work with."

5 Years of Gaming Experience

     ImagiNation Network offers five years of online gaming
experience, quite the veteran in this emerging market.  In
addition, within the next few months it plans to launch CyberPark,
a three-dimensional virtual reality environment with
high-resolution graphics, animated characters and entertainment and
information content.  

     "CyberPark, without a doubt, takes into account all of our
strengths over the last five years," said Erb.  In addition,
ImagiNation Network visitors spend, on average, one hour using the
service per visit, making it attractive for advertisers.

     Concurrently, the network plans on releasing enhanced versions
of games now on the network and new additions.  "We now have card
and board games, role-playing games and action sports, but we're
broadening the array and upgrading," said Erb.  Look for bigger,
better, faster versions of football and baseball games, as well as
newcomers "Metal Storm" and "Bass Fishing."

     AT&T bought the network from Sierra On-Line Inc. about 15
months ago, although it had invested in the project earlier than
that.  Five years ago, Sierra must have dusted off its crystal ball
and seen that, one day, a boxed game would have the same appeal to
some as a boxed lunch, while an online environment could offer a
smorgasbord of entertainment.

     Sierra is in the process of being acquired by CUC
International Inc.

     While the ImagiNation Network had hoped to run barefoot in the
Cyber Park, without a care in its three-dimensional virtual world,
the online gaming network finds itself lacing up those wingtips,
hitting the pavement and seeking business deals.  When its
surrogate parent, Ma Bell, recently put the service up for
adoption, INN went home to its birth parent, Sierra On-Line, to get
some guidance to help it fend for itself in the real world.

     As a result, INN announced March 13 it has signed licensing
agreements with Sierra, making the network more attractive for
potential buyers.  INN's plan is to fatten up its 3-D environment,
code-named Cyber Park, scheduled to debut this summer.

     Cyber Park now will include Sierra's latest CD-ROM games in
multiplayer online versions including "Front Page Sports:  Baseball
Online," "Mission Force:  Cyberstorm," "The Incredible Machine 3,"
"Trophy Bass" and "Red Baron II."  "NTN Trivia" also will be part
of CyberPark's lineup, as well as spades, hearts, backgammon,
cribbage, gin, poker and bridge.  The company said it is in
negotiations with other developers for additional entertainment,
educational and information content and programming.

     Cyber Park will premiere with more than 40 sites and
buildings, card and board games, as well as its own virtual money
system.  Animated nonplayer inhabited characters such as butlers,
waitresses and janitors will interact with visitors as they traipse
through the park.

     ImagiNation Network can be reached at (415) 548-2525.

DAVIDSON CATCHES A CONDOR

     Condor Inc., a developer of entertainment titles for personal
computers and game consoles, is feathering its nest thanks to a
merger it announced March 6 with Davidson & Associates Inc. 
Financial terms were not disclosed.  The privately-held Redwood
City, Calif., company has developed titles such as "Justice League"
and "NFL Quarterback Club" for Acclaim Entertainment and other
publishers.

     Condor will continue to operate independently, and retain its
staff, under the name Blizzard North, a spin-off of Davidson's
entertainment division Blizzard Entertainment located in Torrance,
Calif.  Condor is working with that division on "Diablo," a
role-playing game due out this spring, and will release other
titles under the Blizzard Entertainment name.

     "Our acquisition in 1994 of Blizzard Entertainment, one of the
most popular publishers in the industry, has proven that
high-quality entertainment software is an exciting and successful
aspect of Davidson's studio strategy," said Bob Davidson, chairman
and chief executive officer of Davidson.  "We're delighted that
Condor, one of the most well-respected game developers in the
industry has joined our family of companies.  This team of talented
developers will strengthen our leadership position in the gaming
industry while broadening our R&D capabilities."

     Privately held Condor was founded in 1993 by David Brevik,
Erich Schaefer and Max Schaefer and specializes in developing games
using three-dimensionally rendered and animated graphics.  A
spokeswoman for Davidson said the transaction with Condor would not
be affected by Davidson's merger with CUC International Inc.

     Davidson can be reached at (310) 793-0600, ext. 1230.

SIRIUS USES SECURE CD TECHNOLOGY

     Sirius Publishing has secured a deal to use 3-Di-d, a new
holographic technology for CD developed by Nimbus Manufacturing and
Applied Holographics PLC, to authenticate the winning discs for the
company's $1 million "Treasure Quest" multimedia scavenger hunt
that launches March 22.  For the discs, Nimbus and AH are creating
a hologram that will be placed on the inner mirror band of the disc
for security. 

     Several other software and entertainment companies are test
marketing the technology, as well.

     According to Robert Headrick, president of Nimbus Information,
the CD-ROM subsidiary of Nimbus CD International, the technology
incorporates true 3-D holograms onto CD without loss of disc
capacity or playing time.  Graphic images, logos, text, photographs
or animated sequences can be incorporated inside the hologram, a
treatment many companies are examining as counterfeiting increases.

     Nimbus can be reached at (804) 985-1100; Sirius, at (602)
951-3288.

ANOTHER NINTENDO 64 DELAY

     In a memo to retailers, Nintendo of America Executive Vice
President of Sales and Marketing Peter Main announced that the
Nintendo 64 will be delayed from April 21 to June 23 (EGN, Feb. 5,
p. 3).  The delay primarily is due to a shortage of semiconductor
chips.

     However, the delay will have no bearing on the U.S. launch
date of Sept. 30, according to the memo.  In Japan, the N64 will
launch with "Super Mario 64," "Pilot Wing 64" and a chess game
developed by Sega of Japan.  Retailers in Japan will accept
reservations beginning April 21.

     The U.S. version will launch with eight to 12 titles expected
to be announced at the E3 trade show in May.
