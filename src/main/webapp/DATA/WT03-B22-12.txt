<CENTER><EM>Eby, Judy</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The GBI provides separate checklist-forms for assessing six talent areas:  verbal, visual/spatial, math/science problem-solving, musical, social/leadership, mechanical/technical/inventiveness. Validity studies for these checklists were done at three levels (elementary, high school, and college).  <BR>
Initial referal of students to be considered for enrolment into a gifted program is often done by classroom teachers without recourse to a standardized rating procedure. GBI seeks to provide a framework which -- although still subjective -- can be used to provide an initial identification of students who will receive more in depth evaluation. <BR>
All of the checklists are included in the manual as a set of reproducible masters, and the purchaser is granted the right to copy them for use in a single school.<BR>

<BR>TTCT is probably the best available test of creativity. It can be used with a wide age range of clients -- from young school age children to adults. Four important mental characteristics of gifted and talented individuals are assesed: Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. TTCT asks the examinee to produce as many different solutions as he/she can in response to a presented problem. The examinees' responses are then scored based on production (the number of ideas presented) and divergence (the range of different types of ideas produced). Standardized scoring rules are provided which allow comparison of results. This test takes some time to score due to the free-response format. However, our experience has shown that creativity assessment is not  very amenable to the more common multiple choice format. Verbal TTCT uses word-based exercises and Figural TTCT uses  picture-based exercises. Verbal TTCT can be administered orally to students in the K-3 range.<BR>
The authors suggest that scores should be interpreted by persons with psychometric training. The Technical Manual provides norms and validity/reliability data.<BR>
Monograph #1 is titled Survey of uses of the TTCT. Monograph #2 is entitled Using the TTCT to Guide the Teaching of Creative Behavior. Monograph #3 is titled Guidelines for Administration and Scoring: Comments on Using the TTCT.<BR>
Tests include:  20 booklets, directions manual, 20 scoring worksheets & 1 class record sheet.<BR>
Verbal Technical Supplement includes information on recent norming studies for the verbal TTC.<BR>
Examiner's kit includes only the stimuli needed to administer the test (drawings and stuffed animals)<BR>
Streamlined scoring for figural tests is optional but recommended.<BR>
Class sets include 20 booklets, 20 scoring worksheets, admin. directions and group record sheet.<BR>
RANGE: Kindergarten-adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 30 minutes, scoring 20 minutes<BR>
