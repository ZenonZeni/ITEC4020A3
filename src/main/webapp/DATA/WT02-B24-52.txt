<h3 align=center>Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic</h3>

<p><b>September, 1996</b> </p>

<p>Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic's services are available to anyone
with a documented print disability which includes learning disabilities.
It serves students at all academic levels, as well as people who use
educational and professional materials to pursue careers or personal
interests. </p>

<p>To become a member of RFB&amp;D, send your application for
service and include $75.00 ($50 registration fee plus $25 annual
membership fee). The application form is available from the Customer
Services Department at (800)221-4792. It can also be downloaded from
RFB&amp;D's web page at <a
href="http://www.rfbd.org/forms/apply.frm">http://www.rfbd.org/forms/apply.frm</a>. 
The application form
includes &quot;disability verification&quot; and &quot;certification&quot;
sections which should be completed by a professional in disability
services, education, medicine, psychology, or a related field. The certifying
professional may be any professional in these fields who is familiar with
print disabilities. To complete a learning disabled student's
application, a special education teacher may use the results of testing
given by the school psychologist.
</p>

<p>RFB&amp;D's recorded books require special equipment - a cassette machine
that will play 15/16 ips (inches per second), 4-track cassettes. This
is NOT the standard speed and format of cassette players sold in retail
stores. It is, however, the same speed and format used to produce the Library
of Congress (LOC) &quot;Talking books.&quot; Therefore, if you receive
services from a cooperating network library for the blind and physically
handicapped, you may already have a compatible cassette machine on loan
from your library. If not, you may purchase one from RFB&amp;D. </p>

<p>RFB&amp;D's catalog is available in three formats: on audiocassette,
on computer disk, and in print. On audiocassette, the Quarterly Recorded
Catalog (QRC) is available by subscription for $16 per-year and lists
500-1000 titles per issue. The Quarterly Disk Catalog (QDC) is also
available by subscription for $16 per year and is produced on IBM
3.5&quot; and 5.25&quot; disks, as well as Macintosh 3.5&quot; disks.

<p>The RFB&D Catalog of Books gives a listing of RFB&D's entire library of
books on audio cassette and computer disk (E-Text).  The new 1996
edition includes the following two collections which may be purchased
separately or as a complete set:
<blockquote>
The Juvenile Collection includes listings of books from
elementary grades through the high school level. Price (if
purchased separately): $29.95 (Plus shipping and handling).

<p>The Adult Collection (a 2 book set) includes listings of books from
the college level and beyond, including texts for professionals. Price (if
purchased separately): $49.95 (Plus shipping and handling).

<p>The Complete Set (3 books) includes both Adult and Juvenile
collections. Price: $69.95 (Plus shipping and handling).

</blockquote>
To subscribe to the QRC or QDC, to purchase the print catalog, or for
additional information on any of these, call Customer Service at (800)
221-4792.</p>

<p>Once membership has been established, requests for recorded books may
be placed by mail to Customer Service, 20 Roszel Road, Princeton, NJ 08540.
For more immediate requests, taped books may be ordered by telephone at
(800)221-4792 and (609)452-0606, or fax, twenty-four hours a day to
(609)987-8116. RFB&amp;D also offers an After-Hours Service which is in
operation from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. Monday through Friday and continuously on
weekends. </p>

<p>RFB&amp;D's taped books are provided on free loan for one year and,
if needed, the time may be extended by calling Customer Service. When
RFB&amp;D's audiocassette library does not have a book you need, you have
the option of requesting that it be recorded for you. There is no charge
for the recording service; you are simply asked to provide two identical
print copies of the book and the recording will be done as soon as
possible. </p>

<p>Individuals with learning disabilities may wish to qualify for the Library
of Congress &quot;talking books&quot; through their state Library for the
Blind and Physically Handicapped and obtain the cassette players on loan.
Once this is completed, apply for membership ($75.00) to Recording for
the Blind &amp; Dyslexic to receive free taped materials. This is the least
expensive way to receive this service. If application is made directly
to Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic, there is a charge for the cassette
players, ranging from $119 to $219 plus shipping. </p>
