Services <BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">282. Usage of interstate information
services, and in particular the Internet and other interactive
computer networks, has increased dramatically in recent years.
Such new services create significant benefits for the economy
and the American people. The 1996 Act states that it is the policy
of the United States &quot;to preserve the vibrant and competitive
free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive
computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation,&quot;
and we have long sought to avoid unnecessary regulation of information
services. As usage continues to grow, such services may have an
increasingly significant effect on the public switched network.
<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">283. Therefore, as part of this
comprehensive proceeding, we must consider how our rules can provide
incentives for investment and innovation in the underlying networks
that support the Internet and other information services. We consider
in this section the narrow question of whether to permit incumbent
LECs to assess interstate access charges on information service
providers. We make no specific proposals, and we tentatively conclude
that the existing pricing structure for information services should
remain in place at this time. In Section X, we issue a Notice
of Inquiry to examine various fundamental issues about the implications
of usage of the public switched network by information service
and Internet access providers.<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">284. Beginning with the Computer
II proceeding in the 1970s, we have distinguished between basic
and enhanced communications services. The category of enhanced
services, which includes access to the Internet and other interactive
computer networks, as well as telemessaging, alarm monitoring,
and other services, appears to be quite similar to the term &quot;information
services&quot; in the 1996 Act. In the 1983 Access Charge Reconsideration
Order, we decided that, although enhanced service providers (ESPs)
may use incumbent LEC facilities to originate and terminate interstate
calls, ESPs should not be required to pay interstate access charges.
<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">285. As a result of these decisions,
ESPs may purchase services from incumbent LECs under the same
intrastate tariffs available to end users, by paying business
line rates and the appropriate subscriber line charge, rather
than interstate access rates. Those business line rates are significantly
lower than the equivalent interstate access charges, in part because
of separations allocations and the access charge per-minute rate
structure, and in part because the business lines that ESPs now
purchase generally do not include usage-sensitive charges for
receiving local calls. ESPs, consequently, typically pay incumbent
LECs a flat monthly rate for their connections regardless of the
amount of usage they generate. Pacific Bell estimates that calls
to Internet-provided services could comprise up to 25 percent
of its traffic by the end of the decade. US West projects that
30 percent of all local exchange traffic will be for access to
the Internet by the year 2000. The Internet access market is also
highly competitive and dynamic, with over 2,000 companies offering
Internet access as of mid-1996. It is extremely likely that, had
per-minute interstate access rates applied to ESPs over the past
13 years, the Internet and other information services would not
have developed to the extent they have today -- and indeed may
not have developed commercially at all. <BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">286. For some time, however, incumbent
LECs and others have argued that ESPs impose costs on the network
that are similar to those imposed by providers of interstate voice
telephony, and that ESPs should therefore pay interstate access
charges. Several parties made this argument in their comments
in response to a petition filed by America's Carriers Telecommunications
Association (ACTA) earlier this year. In addition, four BOCs have
filed studies in recent months purporting to show that the current
pricing structure for Internet access contributes to the congestion
of incumbent LEC networks. The BOCs claim that Internet users
typically stay on the line far longer than voice users, but that
the flat monthly rates Internet service providers pay to incumbent
LECs do not cover the additional cost of network upgrades that
are required to support such traffic. <BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">287. In response, information
service providers argue that the rates they pay to incumbent LECs,
combined with the additional revenues from sources such as second
lines installed for Internet usage, more than cover the costs
they impose on the network. These parties also argue that the
imposition of access charges would stifle growth, investment,
and innovation in information services, causing detrimental effects
for the economy and U.S. competitiveness. The Network Reliability
and Interoperability Council (NRIC), an advisory committee of
industry representatives organized to advise the FCC, is also
looking into the effects of Internet usage on the public switched
telephone network.<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">288. We tentatively conclude that
information service providers should not be required to pay interstate
access charges as currently constituted. As we have explained
throughout this Notice, the existing access charge system includes
non-cost-based rates and inefficient rate structures. We see no
reason to extend this regime to an additional class of users,
especially given the potentially detrimental effects on the growth
of the still-evolving information services industry. Although
our original decision in 1983 to treat ESPs as end users rather
than carriers was explained as a temporary exemption, we tentatively
conclude that the current pricing structure should not be changed
so long as the existing access charge system remains in place.
The mere fact that providers of information services use incumbent
LEC networks to receive calls from their customers does not mean
that such providers should be subject to an interstate regulatory
system designed for circuit-switched interexchange voice telephony.
We seek comment on this tentative conclusion. <BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">289. We recognize that this issue
is of special interest to users of the Internet and online services.
Therefore, we have established an electronic mailbox at &lt;<A HREF="mailto:isp@fcc.gov">isp@fcc.gov</A>&gt;
for submission of informal comments on the treatment of Internet
and other information services. Additional information on this
issue is available through our World Wide Web site at &lt;<A HREF=
http://www.fcc.gov/isp.html">http://www.fcc.gov/isp.html</A>&gt;.
We are inviting all parties that file formal paper comments in
this proceeding to submit copies of their comments in electronic
form, and we intend to make those electronic submissions available
for review on the World Wide Web.<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Courier">290. We invite interested parties
to discuss the number of ESPs and Internet service providers,
if any, that can be considered &quot;small entities&quot; within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and whether there
is any reason to establish different requirements for small ESPs
and information service providers.</FONT></TT>
