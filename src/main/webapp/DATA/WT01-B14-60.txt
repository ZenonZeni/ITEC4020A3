Astute investors don't buy individual mutual funds; they build diversified portfolios of funds -- some growth and some value, some small cap and some large cap. The challenge is often not in the diversifying, but in finding one company that can provide such a variety of investment options.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversified_subhd1.gif" ALT="One Source For A Well-Rounded Portfolio"><BR>
<A HREF="../../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments</A> is the nation's only mutual fund complex where growth and value are managed independently by separate organizations with their own headquarters, management teams, portfolio managers, analysts, and even two chief investment officers. Zurich Kemper Investments, located in Chicago, manages the firm's growth portfolios, while New York-based Dreman Value Advisors, Inc., founded by contrarian pioneer David Dreman, directs the value side.
<P>
Today, Zurich Kemper Investments continues to add new members to its worldwide organization, bringing in experienced experts who are well-versed and fully committed to the Kemper Funds' styles of growth and value investing, as well as their renowned fixed-income and international portfolios.
<P>
Zurich Kemper Investments' trademark since 1948 has been research. Both disciplines rely heavily on accurate primary research to identify quality stocks at affordable prices. Says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities: <B>"The cornerstone of the Kemper Funds investment process is solid research, both quantitative and qualitative.</B> It's research that enables our portfolio managers to recognize stocks that are selling at bargain prices in the growth and value sectors and are likely to experience significant price appreciation."
<P>
