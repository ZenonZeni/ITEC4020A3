CORPORATE LEADERS ASKED TO SHARE IN NATIONAL SACRIFICE

     In  further  response  on Dec. 27 to the advertisement by  a  number  of
corporate executives, forty six congressional Democrats led by Reps. Gephardt
(D=Mo.),  Obey  (D=Wis.) and Miller (D=Calif.) called on the  executives   to
detail the specific areas of personal and company sacrifice they are prepared
to make to assist in efforts to balance the budget.  Rep. Obey said "we think
it  is  important that bIg business understand that most Americans  have  not
benefited from the recent performance of the US economy.  We wanted to  point
out  that  there  were  a  number  of  areas  where  they  could  make  major
contributions.  Given the timing of their ad we thought they should  remember
that  there  are a lot of Bob Cratchits out there and that  big  corporations
might  want  to see if they could pick up a little of the burden  instead  of
laying everything off on the Cratchit family."

     Meanwhile,  on  Dec. 27, Sen. Gramm (R=Tex.) said "it is  critical  that
Senate  Republicans stand their ground as budget negotiations resume  in  the
coming  days.  While the Clinton Administration public relations machine  had
reduced  some Senate republicans to a defensive crouch in earlier  stages  of
the  confrontation,  the House Republicans have called  President   Clinton's
bluff.   Whenever   the President finally begins negotiating  with  America's
future   in  mind  instead  of his own, our  House  colleagues  are  due  the
credit...  House Republicans have taken the moral high ground in this  fight;
the  public is on our side, and President Clinton will have no choice but  to
join us if we keep the courage of our convictions," Sen. Gramm said.

CBO PROJECTS BUDGET PLAN WOULD PRODUCE INCREASING SURPLUS IN OUT YEARS

     The Congressional Budget Office on Dec. 21 said the proposed Seven  Year
Balanced Budget would produce increasing surpluses in 2003 of $10 billion, in
2004 of $30 billion and in 2005 of $50 billion.  The figures were given in  a
memorandum to the Senate Democratic Budget Committee staff that was requested
by Sen. Exon (D=Nebr.).

     House  Budget  Committee Chairman Kasich (R=Ohio) in a  comment  on  the
report said the surpluses "will likely be even larger if we maintain the  cap
on discretionary spending.  Our balanced budget," he said, "is an honest  and
fair  plan  that uses real numbers, conservative  economic  assumptions,  and
makes fundamental structural changes in the Federal government. Balancing the
Federal  budget  now  is  the best Christmas present we  could  give  to  our
children and grandchildren," Rep. Kaisch concluded.

INFORMATION ON LOBBYING REGISTRATION UNDER NEW LAW PLACED IN RECORD

     The  Secretary  of the Senate and the Clerk of the House  filed  in  the
Congressional  Record  information on the new Lobbying Disclosure  Act  (P.L.
104=65)  that  takes  effect  on Jan. 1,  1996.   In  general,  the  Lobbying
Disclosure  Act establishes broad requirements that individuals and  entities
who  seek to influence the Federal government register with the Secretary  of
the  Senate and Clerk of the House and disclose their clients, issues,  fees,
and interests of foreign entities.  All registrations filed under the Act are
public records.

     Information,  forms and instructions will be available in early  January
from  the  House  Legislative Resource Center  1036  Longworth  House  Office
Building  and  Senate  Office  of Public  Records,  232  Hart  Senate  Office
Building.  The first reports under the new act will be due by Aug. 14,  1996.
Lobbying  firms  must file separate reports for each  client.  (Congressional
Record Dec. 22 p. S=19290=21).

     After the law was signed, Sen. Cohen (R=Me.) said he was hopeful that it
would persuade the people "that Congress's business can be done in the  open.
Lobbyists  now  have  to make full disclosure of who they  are,  who  they're
lobbying on behalf of and how much they're spending to do what.  I think many
people  are under the impression that lobbyists are dictating and  dominating
the  legislative process in this country.  They're cynical about it and  they
feel that people who have the money are the ones reaping the benefits."

     Sen. Levin (D=Mich.) also praised the bill.  He said one of the  reasons
he  fought for the bill "is because if we want the public to have  confidence
in  our  actions, the nation's business has got to be conducted more  in  the
sunshine.  When public cynicism runs deep about a democratic government, that
government must act to restore that public confidence."

     Common  Cause  President  Ann McBride said the  bill  and  Congressional
earlier  action ending the lobbyist gift system provide hope to the  American
people  by showing that political reform is possible and their voices can  be
heard on Capitol Hill.

SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE REPORTS LABOR SUPPORT OF ANWR OIL SALE

     The  Senate Energy Committee on Dec. 22 reported that  Robert  Georgine,
President  of the AFL=CIO Building and Construction Trades Department sent  a
letter to President asking him to include the provision to lease a small part
of  the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain  for  oil   exploration
and development  in  any  compromise on the budget  reconciliation   package.
The  Committee   said  that on Oct. 25, the presidents of  five   other   key
AFL=CIO unions issued similar endorsements.

     "On  behalf  of  the  over 3 million  American  working  men  and  women
represented  by the 15 member unions of the Building and Construction  Trades
Department, AFL=CIO, I again ask that you support the provision to allow  the
responsible  leasing  of  a small part of the ANWR  coastal  plain.  American
working families across the US depend on your support," Mr. Georgine wrote.

     Senate  Energy  Committee  Chairman Murkowski  (R=Alaska)  said  he  was
pleased  with  the decision to push for ANWR leasing.  "This is  a  big  step
forward  because it is further proof that the opening of a tiny part  of  the
coastal plain to oil exploration will pay huge benefits to the nation and the
working  people  of America.  It will produce hundreds of thousands  of  high
paying  jobs.  For the first time, we have moved ANWR through both the  House
and the Senate with significant support.  The only thing standing in the  way
of ANWR becoming a reality is the Clinton Administration and Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt," he said.
