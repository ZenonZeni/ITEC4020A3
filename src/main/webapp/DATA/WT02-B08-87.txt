<H1>MENTAL HEALTH CONGRESS IS MAJOR EVENT FOR MELBOURNE<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
MORE than 4000 psychiatrists and other medical experts from around the world
will attend a congress in Melbourne this month to discuss the latest developments
in the study and treatment of mental disorders.<BR>
<BR>
The organiser, Professor  Graham Burrows, said today: &quot;This congress,
the 20th held by CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum),
is a major event. It is the biggest medical conference to be held in Melbourne
in recent times.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But the congress's greatest importance is the contribution it will
make to the understanding of health problems that cost Australia billions
of dollars a year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The congress's agenda includes all areas of mental health and disorder.
These range from alcoholism and Alzheimer's disease to the latest technique
of 'imaging' the human brain; from new ways of treating stress to studies
of the physiological and psychological effects of drugs used in the fight
against AIDS.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The congress will be held at the World Congress Centre from 23 to 27 June.
It will be opened by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Burrows, who is head of the department of psychiatry at Melbourne
University/Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, estimated that the congress
would bring $12 million into Victoria, mainly through spending on accommodation
and entertainment.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The congress is held every two years, and getting it for Melbourne
was rather like tendering for the Olympic Games,&quot; he said. &quot;At
any one time between six and 10 countries are lining themselves up as hosts.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My first bid 10 years ago for the congress, failed, but I succeeded
in 1988. Since then a core group of eight of us at Melbourne University
and the Austin have been working with increasing intensity to ensure the
success of the congress.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Professor Burrows said the CINP, founded in 1957, was a professional organisation
that imposed a rigorous selection procedure on membership. It was open only
to psychiatrists and other specialists who had made a significant contribution
to neuro-psychopharmacology.<BR>
<BR>
Of the many thousands of psychiatrists in the world, only about 1500 had
been accepted by the CINP. Australia had 40 members, a comparatively high
figure that reflected its international standing in neuro-psychopharmacology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This area of psychiatry is concerned with the whole spectrum of biological,
 psychological and sociological studies of mental disorders in which medication
plays a major role,&quot; Professor Burrows said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That is why the congress is not confined to CINP members. Invitations
to attend have been accepted by pharmacologists, physiologists, research
scientists, social workers and clinicians, including doctors in several
disciplines such as cardiology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Professor Burrows said information from lectures and discussions at the
congress would be widely distributed by media reports and through the publication
of lectures and seminars and the use of videos and CD-ROM.<BR>
<BR>
The congress will be followed by a two-day conference, also at the World
Congress Centre, on the treatment of depression disorders. The second day
(29 June) - dealing with the community's response to the needs of those
with disorders and their carers - will be open free to the public.<BR>
