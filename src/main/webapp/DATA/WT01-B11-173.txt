<B>WORKING AROUND WATER?<BR>
What you should know about <BR>Fish Habitat and Controlling Aquatic Plants

<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Aquatic plants are a natural part of healthy aquatic ecosystems.  Plants play an important role in the ecology of shoreline areas, and they provide habitat in which fish can spawn, hatch their eggs, feed, and hide from predators.  Aquatic plants also help maintain water quality by stabilizing sediments.<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources aims to maintain and improve the quality of fish habitat in Ontario so that fish will continue to have healthy places to live.  If you own or lease waterfront property, you can help protect the fish in your lake or river by protecting fish habitat along your waterfront.<P>

Having too many aquatic plants can interfere with boats, swimming and other water activities.  At times, some control may be necessary.  However, indiscriminate removal of aquatic plants can harm the environment and destroy fish habitat.<P>

This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to remove aquatic plants.  It outlines when a work permit under the Public Lands Act is required.  For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for aquatic plant removal.  If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases.<P><BR>
<B>PERMITS</B><P>

Anyone proposing to apply a herbicide for the control of aquatic plants must first obtain a permit issued by the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MOEE) under the Pesticides Act.  If you are planning to use a herbicide, you will not need a work permit from MNR.<P>

Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau Canal or Trent Severn Waterway, these areas are under Federal jurisdiction.  To obtain approval for in-water and shoreline works in theses areas, contact the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.<P>

If you wish to remove aquatic plants by physical or mechanical methods (e.g. using rakes, mechanical harvesters or bottom barriers) you may need a work permit from MNR.  The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land.  Historically, any project which involved aquatic plant removal on this land needed a work permit.  Recent legislative changes removed the requirements for work permits for some aquatic plant removal projects.  Listed below are the projects that do, and do not, require a permit under this legislation:<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Aquatic plant removal projects which WILL NOT require a work permit:</B><P>

Removal of up to 100 sq. metres of aquatic vegetation annually from any lake or stream located south of the line formed by Highway 7 from Lake Huron (at Sarnia) to Sharbot Lake at Highway 38, and the area south of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border.<P>

<LI><B>Aquatic plant removal projects which WILL require a work permit:</B><P>

If you plan to remove any amount of aquatic vegetation from a lake or stream in the area north of Highway 7 from Lake Huron to Sharbot Lake; or the area north of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border, you will need approval through the work permit process. <P>
 
	Removal of more than 100 square metres of aquatic vegetation annually from any lake or stream located south of Highway 7 from Lake Huron to Sharbot Lake, and south of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border.
</OL>

If your project involves in-water dredging (removal of rocks or sediment from the bottom) or filling, you require a permit from MNR.<P>

Projects that require a work permit can pose a significant risk to fish habitat.  MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area.  This takes time, so submit your application early.   You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office.<P>   

Keep in mind that you may also need other additional approvals (i.e. Parks Canada). Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency.<P> <BR> 

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water containing fish.  Violations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and a requirement to cover the costs of returning the site to its natural state. <P><BR> 

<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following best management practices will help to ensure that your aquatic plant removal project will not harm fish habitat.  Following these practices will also help to ensure that the federal Fisheries Act is not violated.<P>

To protect the aquatic environment, all plant control projects must be carefully planned and evaluated.  Important factors include:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Control methods:</B>  Many control methods are available for aquatic plants.  These include raking, removing by hand, mechanical harvesting, using cutter-bar devices, bottom barriers such as mats or blankets, and the use of chemicals (herbicides).  Generally, the preferred methods from a fish habitat perspective are hand removal and raking.  The use of  cutter bar devices or mechanical harvesting is also acceptable provided disturbance of the lake bottom is minimized.<P>  

<LI><B>To use a herbicide:</B>  MOEE must approve your project, and you will need to obtain a Permit to Purchase and/or Perform a Water Extermination.  Contact your local office of MOEE.<P>

<LI><B>How much to remove:</B> The amount of plant material you may remove depends on the conditions in your waterfront site.  Factors include the fish species present, the abundance and distribution of plants, and the reasons why you are controlling the plants.<P>

Generally, in lakes with extensive plant growth, you may remove up to 100 square metres of aquatic plants.  However, in lakes with limited plant growth, removal of even small amounts of plant growth may be unacceptable.<P>  

<LI><B>Dispose of the plants on dry land:</B> If the plants are removed by physical or mechanical methods, they should be temporarily placed in a holding site distant from the shoreline before disposal.  This prevents leaching of nutrients back into the water.<P>
	
<LI><B>Timing is critical:</B> Warm-water fish species spawn during spring and early summer.  Removing aquatic plants at this time could kill eggs and young fish.  If you do not require a permit, we recommend that you only remove vegetation after the second or third week in June.<P>  

If you are in an area where a permit is required,  the permit will specify the exact time of removal.<P>  

<LI><B>Avoid projects which involve in-water dredging and filling:</B> Dredging and filling may be harmful to fish and their habitat.  If your project involves filling or dredging (removal of rocks or sediment from the bottom), you will need a permit.<P>  <BR>
