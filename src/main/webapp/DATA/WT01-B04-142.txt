<H2><CENTER>Increase in unprotected sex in urban minority youth blamed on
use of alcohol or marijuana </CENTER>
</H2>
It is now established that regular condom use can decrease the spread of
AIDS. A recent study by Ford and Norris (Journal of the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome, Vol 7:389-396, 1994), studied the effects of the use
of alcohol and marijuana in the context of sexual relationships and the
impact of these substances on the consistency of condom use by urban minority
youth. <BR>
<BR>
The sample design and field work were conducted by the Survey Research Center
of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. A total
of 1435 interviews were obtained from Hispanic and African-American young
adults, ages 15-24, residing in low-income areas in Detroit. <BR>
<BR>
Results indicated that when alcohol and marijuana were used with a sexual
partner, the consistency of condom use decreased even when other variables
related to sexual history were controlled. Alcohol use had a greater negative
effect on condom use for Hispanic men, and marijuana for African-American
women, than it did for Hispanic women and African-American men. <BR>
<BR>
The authors concluded that safe sex intervention programs for urban low
income minority youth need to emphasize the risk of AIDS virus exposure
that results from substance use, casual sex, and sex with multiple partners.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Aside from the many obvious adverse side effects,
use of alcohol and marijuana among teenagers may contribute to the spread
of AIDS. <BR>
<BR>
Clearly, it is counter-productive to give a safe sex message without also
pointing out that the behavior produced by the use of alcohol and marijuana
lessens the likelihood that safe sex will be performed. This factor is often
overlooked in drug prevention programs and sexual eduation courses when,
in fact, these things should be considered together. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Delta 9 THC affects metabolism in human blood cells </CENTER>
</H2>
Delta 9 THC is known to inhibit a variety of immune functions. Diaz and
colleagues, in their paper in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental
Therapeutics, 268:1289-1296, 1994, show that THC, when incubated with cells
from the blood of normal humans, caused increased release of a variety of
metabolites that stimulate acute inflammation. These metabolites are potent
agents that can cause asthma, and which enhance the activity of other cells
which suppress immune defense against virus and other infectious agents.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This paper is one of the first to show that
normal human cells, when incubated with concentrations of THC equivalent
to that found in the blood of regular smokers of marijuana, cause immune
cells to release compounds which promote inflammation within the lungs,
and at the same time, suppress the natural defenses against external bacterial
and viral agents that cause disease. <BR>
<BR>
While these studies are conducted in the test tube, the implications for
smoking marijuana in humans, particularly those who smoke or with a tendency
towards asthma or respiratory disease are obvious. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Attempt made to use marijuana to treat Tourette's Syndrome </CENTER>
</H2>
A nurse consultant and a visiting psychiatrist reported on a single case
of Tourette's Syndrome treated successfully with smoked marijuana (Hemming
and Yellowlees, Journal of Psychopharmacology 7-4 1993 pp. 389-391 ). <BR>
<BR>
Tourette's Syndrome is a disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal
tics. The tics occur many times daily and may include obscenities and other
strange behaviors. Untreated, the disorder tends to be a lifelong disease
characterized by remissions and relapses. Haloperidol (Haldol) is the drug
of choice in the treatment of this disorder. <BR>
<BR>
The patient they reported started to smoke marijuana at age 35 to get relief
while he continued his Haldol. The anecdotal improvement prompted the case
report. There was no stopping of the drug to see if symptoms returned, and
no rechallenge with marijuana. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This report is the type of anecdote used to
support claims for the use of smoked marijuana to treat disease. It is interesting
that the standard treatment of Haldol was continued throughout the period
of marijuana use with this patient, and there was no placebo control or
rechallenge involved. There are ways of using drugs in single patients,
known as the &quot;n of 1&quot; method. Efficacy as well as side effects
can be monitored using this method in a single patient. This was not done
here. It is also of interest that there is no objective documentation of
improvement in Tourette's Syndrome in the patient. Neither of the authors
has any expertise in neurologic diseases. Nicotine is also known to potentiate
the effects of Haldol in improving motor tics in this disorder. It is possible
that any one of the 4000 components found in marijuana smoke provided beneficial
effects, if, in fact, they did occur. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Study finds self-reporting of Illicit drug use differs greatly
from actual test results. </CENTER>
</H2>
Self-reporting by users, of the frequency of their drug use, is the measure
used In a variety of studies regarding prevention strategies, needle exchange
programs, and effects of treatment interventions, to indicate the success
rate of these programs. <BR>
<BR>
The report by Hindin in the International Journal of the Addictions, 29:771-789,
1994, highlights the fact that when an objective measurement is done, such
as an assay of hair for actual determination of cocaine, heroine, and marijuana
use, the indication is far greater than that reported by the user. <BR>
<BR>
Among a group of patients followed up post-treatment, only 51 percent of
cocaine positive people and 67 percent of heroin positive people gave an
accurate history by their own self report. The correlation with marijuana
was even weaker. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> The study emphasizes the folly of depending
on self reporting as an outcome variable in any study regarding the efficacy
of treatment and prevention programs. <BR>
<BR>
Objective measures of exposure need to be done because of the notorious
inaccuracy of self reporting. This self reporting, with its obvious pitfalls,
is, however, currently being used to prove &quot;efficacy&quot; of needle
exchange programs which claim to limit the spread of HIV by providing &quot;clean&quot;
needles to addicts. The purported success of these programs is based, in
part, on self reporting by the addict of whether or not they shared needles.
