BORLAND SAYS CONGRESS
CHOSE TO PROTECT ONLY
CODE, NOT FUNCTIONALITY

     In enacting copyright protection for computer programs,
Congress sought to prohibit only the literal copying of code and
specifically allowed the creation of programs that perform the
same function, as long as the code of each program is original,
Borland International argued in its Dec. 8 brief to the U.S.
Supreme Court.  Lotus Development Corp. v. Borland International,
No. 94-2003 (U.S.); see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter,
Dec. 21, 1995.

     If Lotus's position is adopted as law, Borland contends,
there will be "potentially calamitous consequences for the
software industry in the United States" because the industry
depends on the ability of different programs to be compatible and
work "on top" of each other.

     Oral argument is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 8, at 1 p.m.

     Lotus Development Corp. sued Borland International over
Borland's use of the menu command tree of the Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet in its competing line of Quattro Pro spreadsheet
software.  Use of the menu tree was necessary for Lotus users to
import their data into Quattro Pro.  The district court in Boston
ruled in favor of Lotus, but the First Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals reversed, finding the command tree is an uncopyrightable
method of operation.  The Supreme Court agreed to review the
case, the first time it will rule on copyright protection for
software.

     Lotus's argument that the menu tree and the program are
indistinguishable must be rejected, Borland argues.

     "As a matter of economics," Borland says, "copyright
protection for source and object code blocks only one of a
virtually unlimited number of ways of achieving the same 'certain
results'; copyright protection for these 'certain results,' such
as a menu command hierarchy, potentially creates vast market
power likely to chill further innovation."

     When Congress decided that computer programs should be
copyrightable, its main concern was stopping the illegal
duplication of software on floppy disks, Borland argues.
Congress clearly chose to exclude things like the Lotus menu tree
from protection, but even if congressional intent was ambiguous,
protection of these "external features" would violate the chief
intent of the copyright law, which is to promote the public good,
Borland argues.

     "Lotus's menu command hierarchy may well constitute
patentable subject matter," Borland states.  "But Lotus bases its
claim on the law of copyright, not patent.  Lotus's argument
ignores the important policies and procedures of the patent law,
reads important limiting language out of the copyright statute,
and refuses even to acknowledge that its proposed extension of
the scope of copyright must 'ultimately serve the public good,'
as this Court has so often counseled."

     Borland is represented by Gary L. Reback, Michael Barclay,
Susan A. Creighton, Colleen Bal and Lisa A. Davis of Wilson,
Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, CA; by Peter E. Gelhaar
and Katherine L. Parks of Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar in Boston;
and by house counsel Robert H. Kohn.

LAW PROFESSORS URGE
AFFIRMANCE OF RULING

     In separate amicus briefs, numerous copyright law professors
are supporting Borland's arguments seeking affirmance of the
First Circuit's ruling.

     In one filing, 34 professors reiterate Borland's contention
that copyright law excludes protection for systems and methods of
operation.

     "Unlike conventional literary works, computer programs
contain many components that are potentially patentable," the
professors state.  "It is, thus, appropriate for courts to filter
out not only abstractions, but also constituent elements of
useful processes and methods of operation before making a
comparison of two computer programs for the purpose of
determining whether infringement has occurred."

     "If computer programs need more protection against
competitive imitation than copyright, supplemented by patent and
trade secrecy law, can provide, software developers should seek
additional legal protection for computer programs from Congress,"
the professors said.

     The professors' brief was filed by Pamela Samuelson of
Cornell Law School in Ithaca, NY.

     In a separate brief, copyright law professors Peter S.
Menell of the University of California at Berkeley and Dennis S.
Karjala of Arizona State University point out that the copyright
statute distinguishes between computer program instructions and
what results from the execution of the instructions.  The
copyright in the instructions themselves " the code " does not
extend to the program's output unless that output independently
qualifies as a copyrightable work, the professors argue.

     The menu command hierarchy does not qualify, the professors
state, because it is a method of operation that is excluded under
Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act.

     "[T]o extend copyright by protecting functional works
without explicit congressional authorization would undermine the
integrity of the entire intellectual property law system," they
said.

TWO MEN AGREE TO PAY
$600,000 TO SETTLE
INFRINGEMENT SUIT

     Two men who operated a computer bulletin board system agreed
in early December to pay Sega of America $600,000 to settle a
lawsuit alleging that users of the BBS were able to obtain
illegal copies of Sega video games.  Sega of America v. The
Ghetto, No. 93-CV-4261 (ND CA).

     Sega filed suit in December 1993 against The Ghetto, a BBS
run by two California men, Marqui Labatore and Kurtis Buckmaster.
The suit alleged that the men obtained copies of Sega video games
and then allowed BBS members to either pay a fee to download the
games, or provide copies of other games in exchange for download
rights.

     Among the games allegedly copied were Golden Axe, Jurassic
Park, Sonic Spinball and Shining Force.  The games were
originally produced for use with the Sega video game system and
were modified for use on personal computers.

     Sega learned of the infringing activity after receiving an
anonymous tip.  An investigator then logged onto The Ghetto and
recorded the activities taking place there.

     Sega was represented by Neal A. Smith and Jane Quale Keene
of Limbach & Limbach in San Francisco.  The defendants were
represented by James M. Braden of Arnelle Hastie McGee Willis &
Greene in San Francisco.

11TH CIR. FINDS JURY
INSTRUCTIONS IMPROPER,
REMANDS SOFTWARE CASE

     A federal judge erred when he told a jury it should filter
out only the copying of nonliteral elements of a computer program
in determining whether infringement occurred, a panel of the 11th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 22, remanding the suit
for a new trial.  Bateman et al. v. Mnemonics Inc. et al.,
No. 93-3234 (11th Cir.).

     The judge also failed to properly instruct the jury on the
law as it relates to copying necessitated by compatibility
requirements, the panel said.

     Plaintiffs Brian E. Bateman and Charles H. Fricker created
the single board computer operating system (SBCOS), hardware
logic diagrams for their circuit board, and certain programmable
array logic software.  The lawsuit " alleging copyright
infringement, unfair competition and theft of trade secrets "
resulted from a complicated series of licensing agreements
entitling the defendants to use the software and diagrams.  The
defendants are accused of developing similar software after
having access to the plaintiffs' technology.

     A jury awarded the plaintiffs a total of $525,000 on their
claims.  The defendants appealed the verdict, raising numerous
alleged errors.  The plaintiffs appealed the trial judge's
refusal to award exemplary damages.

     The panel first said the jury was improperly instructed to
filter out only the copying of nonliteral elements of the
plaintiffs' software, which could have left the jury with the
erroneous belief that any copying of literal elements was
copyright infringement as a matter of law.

     Although Computer Associates v. Altai, the case the Second
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals used to develop the "abstraction-
filtration-comparison" test, involved alleged copying of
nonliteral elements of a computer program, the panel said, a
similar analysis must be performed on alleged copying of literal
elements as well, in order to eliminate unprotectable expression
prior to comparison with an allegedly infringing work.  (For
Computer Associates, see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter,
July 2, 1992, P. 15,135.)

     The panel also found that the trial judge should have, but
did not, instruct the jury on the legal consequences of copying
that is necessitated by the need for a program to be compatible
with other programs, such as operating system software.  The
plaintiffs alleged copying of certain interface specifications
that allowed their software to work with other programs.  The
defendants countered that the copying was necessary in order to
achieve compatibility.

     The panel said that interface specifications could be
protectable under copyright law, but also said that external
considerations such as compatibility requirements could limit or
eliminate such protection.  The panel did not decide whether the
alleged copying constituted infringement, instead remanding the
case to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Florida for a new trial.

JUDGE APPROVES SETTLEMENT
IN SUIT OVER SONGS COPIED
FROM COMPUSERVE DATABASE

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Dec. 19 approved the settlement in Frank Music
Corp.'s class action alleging online music copyright infringement
by CompuServe Inc., due to subscribers' uploading and downloading
copyrighted songs without paying royalties.  Frank Music Corp. v.
CompuServe Inc., No. 93 Civ. 8153 JFK (SD NY); see Computer
Industry Litigation Reporter, Nov. 16, 1995.

     The Dec. 19 order calls for CompuServe to pay $568,000 to
the Harry Fox Agency (HFA) " most to be distributed to class
plaintiffs who are HFA principals " and the creation of a
licensing agreement for online "forum" managers to upload and
download recordings of copyrighted songs.  HFA provides music
licensing and royalty collection services to more than 12,000
music publisher-principals.  The class action was filed by a
class of 384 music publishers, alleging infringement of 941
musical compositions.

     CompuServe, a wholly owned subsidiary of H&R Block Group,
Inc., maintains a computer bulletin board system that includes
literary, graphic and musical databases.  CompuServe grants
access to its bulletin board to its paid subscribers, who use a
modem and their own personal computers to upload (put into the
bulletin board) literary, graphic and musical material chosen by
subscribers, and select and download these same materials.  Each
subscriber pays a monthly fee plus a charge for the amount of
time he or she is connected to the bulletin board.

     The complaint alleged that CompuServe allowed and encouraged
subscribers to upload copyrighted songs, stored the unauthorized
recordings, and allowed subscribers to download copies of the
recordings.  The complaint sought $100,000 for each of the more
than 690 alleged acts of infringement.

     A settlement agreement was announced Nov. 7, and individual
plaintiffs had until Dec. 12 to opt out.  Edward P. Murphy,
president of the National Music Publishers' Association,
financial supporter of the case, said the settlement would assure
just compensation for the use of musical works in new
technologies.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Alan L. Shulman of
Silverman & Shulman, P.C. in New York City.

GREENLEAF SEEKS RULING
THAT SOFTWARE DOES NOT
INFRINGE AMA'S RIGHTS

     Software that uses medical data to determine a patient's
degree of impairment does not infringe the American Medical
Association's copyrights in its Guides to Evaluation of Permanent
Impairment, plaintiff Greenleaf Medical Systems Inc. contends in
a declaratory judgment complaint filed Dec. 1 in federal court in
San Jose.  Greenleaf Medical Systems Inc. v. American Medical
Association, No. C-95 20820 (ND CA).

     Although Greenleaf used portions of the Guides, including
tables, charts and algorithms, in its software, the portions it
copied are not protectable by copyright, Greenleaf contends.

     The Guides, whose use is mandated in at least 30 states,
allow physicians to express patients' impairment ratings in a
standard way.  Greenleaf developed a system in which its products
can send data directly to a computer, which will use Greenleaf's
software to calculate an impairment rating.  Greenleaf used the
formulas, methods and algorithms contained in the Guides, and
Greenleaf expressly encourages customers to purchase copies of
the Guides to use in conjunction with the software, the complaint
states.

     According to the complaint, Greenleaf asked the AMA whether
a license was required for Greenleaf to use the information in
the Guides in its software, and was told no license was
necessary.  However, the complaint states, the AMA later
threatened to sue Greenleaf unless the company entered into a
license agreement and paid back royalties.

     Greenleaf contends that the AMA's copyright in the Guides is
invalid because the individual AMA members who authored the
various sections own the copyrights to their work.  Greenleaf
also asserts that the sections its used are uncopyrightable
because the expression is inseparable from the underlying idea,
and because the expression is standard in the medical community.
Greenleaf also raises affirmative defenses of fair use, waiver,
laches, estoppel and unclean hands.

     Greenleaf is represented by Ian N. Feinberg and Janet M.
Craycroft of Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich in Palo Alto, CA; and
by James R. Kyper and Stephen S. Wu of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart in
Pittsburgh.

MOTOROLA ALLEGES
COPYING OF TWO-WAY
RADIO SOFTWARE

     Software that runs two-way radio systems sold by Motorola
has been illegally modified by defendants who are selling the
modified programs to third parties who can then obtain
unauthorized access to emergency services' radio frequencies,
Motorola alleges in a suit filed Nov. 21 in Tulsa federal court.
Motorola Inc. v. Gass et al., No. 95 C 11560 (ND OK).

     Motorola sells a variety of two-way radio communications
systems, both "trunking" and "nontrunking" systems, which are
used by law enforcement and emergency services organizations.
"Trunking" systems automatically set the radios in use to an
available frequency and avoid the problem of "jamming," which
occurs when radios that are too near each other attempt to use
the same frequency at the same time.  The radio systems are
controlled by Motorola's proprietary software.

     According to the complaint, defendants Larry Nathan Gass,
John David Astacio, Tulsa Security Patrol and Action Helicopters
have illegally modified the Motorola software to allow
individuals other than legitimate Motorola customers to use the
radio systems.

     These third-party purchasers of the modified systems believe
they are purchasing genuine Motorola products, Motorola alleges,
resulting in damage to the company's reputation.  In addition,
according to the complaint, charges accrued through use of the
modified systems are wrongly billed to legitimate customers or
are simply absorbed by Motorola, the company alleges.  The
defendants' actions also risk overloading the airwaves in the
Tulsa area, resulting in communications problems for legitimate
users, the complaint states.

     The complaint contains counts for copyright infringement,
trademark infringement and unfair competition.  It seeks an
injunction, statutory or actual damages, and attorneys' fees and
costs, along with seizure and destruction of infringing
materials.

     Motorola is represented by Mark K. Blongewicz of Hall,
Estill, Hardwick, Gable, Golden & Nelson in Tulsa; by Mark S. Lee
and Alison D. Spear of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips in Los Angeles;

MICROSOFT OPPOSES AVI'S
APPEAL OF PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION DENIAL

     A federal court did not abuse its discretion or act
improperly when it refused to enter a preliminary injunction
against Microsoft in a trademark dispute over Microsoft's use of
the three-letter suffix "AVI" in file names in its Windows 95
software, Microsoft argued in a Dec. 13 brief to the Ninth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  AVI Systems Inc. v. Microsoft,
No. 95-16577 (9th Cir.); see Computer Industry Litigation
Reporter, Dec. 21, 1995.
               AVI Systems designs, develops and distributes computer
hardware and software products.  According to the complaint,
AVI's president and CEO, plaintiff Joseph Shamash, obtained
registration with the Patent and Trademark Office of the mark
"AVI" for use in connection with the company's products.  The
complaint alleges that Microsoft then contacted AVI and asked
permission to use the AVI mark for its Windows video software,
known as "Audio Video Interleaved."  Despite AVI's denying
permission, Microsoft proceeded to use the mark, the complaint
states.  AVI sought a preliminary injunction, which was denied by
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

     AVI claims the district court erred in holding that the
plaintiffs were not likely to establish likelihood of consumer
confusion and would therefore be unable to prevail, and that
Microsoft was likely to establish a "fair use" defense.

     "The essence of AVI Systems' argument is that it disagrees
with the weight that the district court gave to some of the
evidence, it disagrees with the district court's evaluation of
the credibility of its chief witness, and it disagrees with the
interpretation the district court gave the evidence it did find
believable," Microsoft states.  "These are the very matters that
are left to a trial court's discretion.  The district court did
not commit clear error or abuse its considerable discretion."

     Microsoft also contends the appeal is moot because Windows
95 has already been released, and there are no related products
anticipated to be released before the case is resolved on the
merits.

     Microsoft is represented by David T. McDonald of McDonald &
Quackenbush in Seattle; Rebecca A. Lenaburg of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen in San Francisco; and by house counsel Thomas W.
Burt.

PATENT CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
IS A MATTER OF LAW,
WESTVIEW TELLS SUP. CT.

     The use of extrinsic evidence in the interpretation of
patent claims does not automatically transform the issue from one
of law to one of fact, Westview Instruments Inc. argued in its
Dec. 10 response brief to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Markman et al.
v. Westview Instruments Inc. et al., No. 95-26 (U.S.); see
Computer Industry Litigation Reporter, Oct. 19, 1995.

     The court has set oral arguments in the case for Jan. 8.

     Westview urged the Supreme Court to affirm the landmark en
banc ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(CAFC) that the construction of patent claims in a jury trial of
patent infringement litigation is a matter of law for judges to
decide and not an issue of fact for juries to determine.


     Herbert Markman, the inventor of a patented system for
controlling the inventory in dry cleaning stores, sued Westview
for patent infringement in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania.  At trial, the central issue was
whether the word "inventory," which was not defined in the patent
claims, covered only a system for tracking garments or whether it
could be construed to include the tracking of monetary
transactions as well.

     The trial judge had instructed the jury to determine the
meaning of the disputed claim language.  However, after the jury
returned a verdict of infringement on two claims, he ruled that
claim construction is a matter of law for the court to decide and
he granted a j.m.o.l. of noninfringement.

     In April, the Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the
lower court ruling that the trial court has the power to
determine claim language even when extrinsic evidence is required
to clarify the meaning of a claim.  Markman sought review on the
grounds that the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to have
juries determine the meaning of patent terms.

Seventh Amendment

     In its response brief, Westview contended that the
historical record supports the proposition that judges, not
juries, construe claim language.  The Seventh Amendment, the
petition said, was intended to protect the right to a jury trial
on issues of substance, not on matters of form and procedure.
The drafters of the Bill of Rights included the Seventh Amendment
to preserve the institution of the jury, not to define the roles
of judge and jury in cases where the right to jury trial is
preserved, Westview asserted.

     "Petitioners have confused the more common inquiry, whether
the jury trial right attaches to a particular cause of action,
with the less common inquiry involved here of whether a
particular issue in a jury trial is for the court or the jury,"
the brief stated.

     Westview also argued that the Supreme Court has consistently
held since 1825 that claim construction is a matter of law, even
when extrinsic evidence is used to aid in interpreting disputed
claims.  Citing Winans v. New York and Erie R.R. Co., 62 U.S.
(21 How.) 88 (1859), Westview noted that the Supreme Court held
then that a judge may seek information from expert witnesses to
explain terms of the art, but that the court itself is the final
authority on the meaning of a patent claim.

     Finally, Westview contended that the Federal Circuit's
ruling advances patent law policies by promoting specific and
clear claims and consistent interpretation while leaving to the
jury the traditional and central role of determining the
underlying facts.

     Westview's response brief was filed by Frank H. Griffin III,
Peter A. Vogt and Polly M. Shaffer of Gollatz, Griffin & Ewing,
Philadelphia.  Markman is represented by William B. Mallin,
Timothy P. Ryan and Timothy S. Coon of Eckert Seamans Cherin &
Mellot, Pittsburgh.

ATARI CLAIMS BREACH OF
CONTRACT IN DEVELOPMENT
OF 'BATMAN', OTHER GAMES

     Atari Corp. entered into several agreements with two
companies for development and licensing of video games, but the
companies have failed to perform all but one contract, Atari
alleges in a complaint filed Dec. 21 in California Superior Court
in San Jose.  Atari Corp. v. Probe Entertainment et al.,
No. CV754749 (CA Super. Ct., Santa Clara Cty.).

     The suit seeks a declaratory judgment as to Atari's rights
under the contracts, which were for the development, licensing
and/or distribution of Batman Forever, Mortal Kombat 3, Frank
Thomas "Big Hurt" Baseball, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and
Ironman.

     The defendants are Probe Entertainment Ltd., a British
corporation, and Acclaim Entertainment Inc., a New York company.
According to the complaint, Atari entered into contracts with
Probe for development of Batman Forever and Mortal Kombat 3, and
contracted with Acclaim for licensing rights to Batman Forever
and distribution rights to the baseball, basketball and Ironman
games.  Atari and Acclaim also entered into a payment agreement,
the complaint states.

     "Under those agreements," the complaint states, "Atari has
paid Probe $420,000 and Acclaim $500,000 for a total of $920,000.
However, only Basketball has been completed, while Batman has
been canceled, Baseball has been stalled, and Probe has
effectively stopped work on MK3.  Given Atari's poor experience
with Probe and Acclaim, Atari can no longer continue development
of these products."

     The complaint contains counts for breach of contract,
rescission, interference with contract, and declaratory relief.
In addition to the declaration of the parties' rights, the
complaint seeks damages, pre- and post-judgment interest at 10%
annually, and attorneys' fees.

     Atari is represented by Ardon W. Beene of San Jose.

(ND CA); see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter, Aug. 3, 1995.

     The motion also seeks dismissal of certain defendants who
argue they do not have any records responsive to the plaintiff's
FOIA requests.

     Cryptography is a branch of mathematics used to scramble
electronic communications so that they cannot be understood by
anyone who does not have the correct "key" to decode them.
Plaintiff John Gilmore, a member of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's board of directors, claims that numerous government
agencies have unlawfully denied or delayed responding to his
requests under the FOIA for information about export controls on
cryptography.

     Named as defendants are the State Department, the Justice
Department, the Commerce Department, the National Security
Council, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Office of Legal Counsel, Office of Information
and Privacy, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Interpol,
Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, Bureau of Export
Administration and Office of Defense Trade Controls.

     According to the defendants, the Office of Intelligence and
Policy Review, INTERPOL-U.S. National Central Bureau and
Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys all conducted "reasonable
searches" for documents in response to Gilmore's request, and
found none.  Therefore, according to the defendants, the court
lacks jurisdiction over these defendants and claims against them
must be dismissed.

     "Other defendants " [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and
[Office of Legal Counsel] " have completed the processing of
documents that they found responsive to plaintiff's FOIA
request," the defendants assert.  "State [Department] and
[National Security Agency], however, have been faced with
enormous and unforeseeable strains on their information
processing resources, and due to the increasing difficulty of
processing information requests, and the limited resources
available to them, these defendants have not been able to
complete the processing of plaintiff's requests within the 10-day
statutory time frame.  Because these defendants are faced with
'extraordinary circumstances' and are 'exercising due diligence'
in processing the requests, they seek a stay of proceedings
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 552(a)(6)(C) to complete their
processing of plaintiff's requests."

     "Similarly, while the [National Security Council] is not an
agency subject to the FOIA, it too is deluged with requests for
information which likewise strain its ability to respond to them
pursuant to its discretionary disclosure policy," the defendants
contend.

     Gilmore is represented by Lee Tien of Berkeley, CA.  The
government is represented by  Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney
General; Michael J. Yamaguchi, U.S. Attorney; Mary Beth Uitti,
Chief of the Justice Department's Civil Division; and Elizabeth
A. Pugh and Felicia L. Chambers, Justice Department attorneys.

JUDGE FINDS CONTINUED PILL
USE NO BREACH WHERE PROXY
TO OUST BOARD NOT BARRED

     The board of Wallace Computer Service, Inc. did not breach
its duty by refusing to defuse its poison pill defense against
hostile suitor Moore Corp. Ltd., because it is nondiscriminatory
and will have no effect on the success of Moore's pending proxy
contest against the board, a federal judge in Wilmington held
Dec. 4.  Moore Corp. Ltd. et al. v. Wallace Computer Services,
Inc. et al., No. 95-472 (D DE).

     Senior U.S. District Judge Murray Schwartz declined Moore's
request to enjoin the use of the pill, but he also turned down
Wallace's counterclaim bid for a preliminary injunction based on
the assertion that an acquisition by Moore would violate federal
antitrust laws.

     The litigation arose from an attempt by Moore and its wholly
owned subsidiary, FRDK, Inc., to launch a tender offer for
Wallace.  Moore, filing suit less than 24 hours after it
announced the offer, sought to prevent the application of
Wallace's anti-takeover measures, such as a poison pill, the
Delaware Business Combination Act (which impedes certain mergers
without the affirmative vote of 80% of the outstanding shares),
and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (which
delays the consummation of a merger that is not approved by the
incumbent board).

     Moore sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the
defendant directors from implementing their anti-takeover devices
" mainly a poison pill that presented the most serious obstacle
to the consummation of its tender offer.  Wallace counterclaimed
that Moore's offer, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of
the Clayton Act.

     Judge Schwartz noted that since the preliminary injunction
hearing during Nov. 7 to 9, he had been "carpet bombed" with a
"salmagundi" of documents.
               The court found first that although the board's adoption of
a golden parachute and the amendment of the company bylaws to
require a longer advance notice period for shareholder proposals
were not defensive measures, the failure to redeem the poison
pill must be judged under the enhanced scrutiny test of Unocal
(Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum Co., DE Sup. Ct. 493 A.2d 946 [1985]).
Even under that more demanding test, however, the use of the pill
to fend off what the board in good faith believed to be an
inadequate offer was reasonable and proportionate, the court
held.

     The use of the pill is not coercive or preclusive because,
"[f]irst, retention of the pill will have no discriminatory
effect on shareholders, as is generally the result in any
situation involving a coercive offer," the court wrote.  "Second,
and more important, retention of the pill will have no effect on
the success of the proxy contest."

     Plaintiffs are represented by Jesse Finkelstein and Daniel
Driesbach of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and by
Donald Strauber, Thomas McCormack, William D'Amico, Eric Welsh
and Robert Schwinger of Chadbourne & Park L.L.P. in New York
City.

     Defendants are represented by Michael Goldman, Stephen
Norman and Michael Pottenger of Potter, Anderson & Corroon in
Wilmington; and by Walter Carlson, Richard Kapnick, William
Baumgartner Jr. and Brandon Lawniczak of Sidley & Austin in
Chicago.
