<h2>Group I:</h2>
<b>MIE1001H - Dynamics II</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/zu.html"> J.W. Zu </a>
<br>
Variational principles and Lagrange's Equations, Hamilton's 
principle.  Kinematics of rigid body motion, Euler angles, rigid 
body equations of motion. Hamilton's equations, cyclic 
coordinates, Legendre transformations. Canonical 
transformations, Hamilton-Jacobi theory.<p>

<b>MIE1101H - Thermodynamics II</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/ward.html"> C.A. Ward </a>
<br>
A course in which the postulatory approach is used to develop 
the theory of thermodynamics. The postulates are stated in 
terms of a variational principle that allows them to be applied 
to systems subjected to fields, to phase transitions, and to 
systems in which surface effects are dominant. The 
thermodynamic stability of systems is examined and examples 
of stable, metastable and unstable systems are discussed.<p>

<b>MIE1201H - Fluid Mechanics III</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/currie.html"> I.G. Currie</a>
<br>
This fundamental course develops the conservation laws 
governing the motion of a continuum and applies the results 
to the case of Newtonian fluids, which leads to the Navier-
Stokes equations. From these general equations, some 
theorems are derived from specific circumstances such as 
incompressible fluids or inviscid fluids. Basic solutions to, and 
properties of, the governing equations are explored for the 
case of viscous, but incompressible, fluids. Topics included 
involve exact solutions, low-Reynolds-number flows, and 
laminar boundary layers.<p>

<b>MIE1301H - Solid Mechanics </b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/sinclair.html"> A.N. Sinclair </a>
<br>
Review of tensor notation; analysis of stress in a continuum 
including principal stress, invariants, spherical and deviator 
tensors; analysis of deformation and strain in a continuum 
including Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions, spherical and 
deviator tensors, strain rate tensors and compatibility 
equations; equilibrium equations; constitutive relations for 
general linear solid, application to elastic, plastic and 
viscoelastic solids; anisotropic elasticity, orthotropic materials.<p>

<b>MIE1801H - Engineering Analysis III</b> -  <a href="../../staff/profiles/mandelis.html"> A. Mandelis </a>
<br>
Variational Calculus: introduction to calculus of variations; 
Euler-Lagrange equation; extensions to several variables; 
constrained extremals; methods of approximation. Integral 
Equations: their classification; series solution; boundary 
integral equations; delta function responses, Green's 
functions, approximate techniques. Linear and Nonlinear 
Systems: phase space; chaos; differential algebraic systems; 
dynamic systems.<p>

<h2>Group II:</h2>
<b>MIE1401H - Design of Work Places - A.M. Smiley </b>
<br>
Introduction to ergonomics in industrial settings.  
Biomechanics related to manual materials handling, repetitive 
strain injuries, visual and auditory limitations, human 
information processing and short term memory limitations, 
psychomotor skill, anthropometry and workspace layout, 
population stereotypes, design of controls and displays, 
circadian rhythms and design of shiftwork schedules.  
Exclusions: MIE240H or MIE343H.<p>

<b>MIE1501H- Information Systems I: Data and Knowledge Modeling </b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/fox.html"> M.S. Fox </a>
<br>
Theme:  Qualitative, symbolic representations of information 
and knowledge, presentation and access to information.   
Types of knowledge: onceptual level (concepts, relations, 
attributes, truth, uncertainty, meta, axioms), eneric level (time, 
activity, state, causality, space).  Representation methods: 
relational, object oriented, conceptual. Networks and 
distributed representations.  Access to information: Query 
Languages (SQL), Network Services (ISO mail standards), 
KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language).  
Interface technologies: X/Motif, windows. <p>

<b>MIE1601H - Introduction to Operational Research </b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/posner.html"> M.J.M. Posner </a>
<br>
Mathematical modeling in deterministic and nondeterministic 
systems, including topics in mathematical programming, 
network analysis, decision analysis, inventory theory, dynamic 
programming and Markovian decision processes.<p>

<b>MIE1901H -  Technology, Society, and the Environment</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/vanderburg.html"> W.H. Vanderburg </a>
<br>
This course develops a conceptual framework for 
understanding technology-society-biosphere interactions and 
applies this to the development of preventive approaches for 
the engineering, management and regulation of modern 
technology in order to reduce burden imposed on society and 
the environment. Topics include: society as a cultural system; 
industrialization as a process that simultaneously transforms 
technology, society and the biosphere; technology as 
knowledge; the modern corporation; underdevelopment and 
technology transfer; and sustainable development. Exclusion:  
APS103H.
