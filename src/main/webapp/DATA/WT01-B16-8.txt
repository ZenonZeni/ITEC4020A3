<P>
Verification will be conducted on all waste that is accepted into the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management System (CRWMS). Verification will consist of collecting information concerning
the type, quantity, and nature of the materials to be accepted, confirming that the information
collected is complete, and documenting certain physical attributes of the material, including
identity. Once collected and verified, the information will be used by the CRWMS to
demonstrate that appropriate safeguards are in place. 
<P>
 This Verification Plan establishes the conceptual framework for the verification process. From
this plan, detailed procedures will be developed to implement the verification process. Two
factors will significantly impact the nature of the process. First, the information collected during
verification will be used for Material Control and Accounting (MC&amp;A) purposes, which is
beyond the scope of the verification process outlined in the 
<I>
Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste

</I>
 (10 CFR 961, the Standard Contract- Reference 1). Secondly, several Purchasers are currently
investigating
the feasibility of using dual purpose canisters for the storage of spent nuclear fuel at their sites
and transporting the spent nuclear fuel to a Federal facility at the time of acceptance. If these
canisters are used, there is no intent to re-open the canisters prior to DOE's acceptance. These
canisters may be used as early as 1997. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A4"> <B> 1.1 SCOPE </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This plan presents the verification process in terms of the Standard Contract, and identifies areas
where the requirements outlined in the Standard Contract must be slightly modified to allow for
the implementation of the verification process described in this plan. These modifications will
allow the Purchasers to use various types of sealed multi-element canisters within the framework
of the verification process. This version of the Verification Plan is limited to a discussion of the
process that will be implemented for commercial spent nuclear fuel, whether canistered or
uncanistered prior to acceptance. The term &quot;waste&quot; throughout this document refers
to spent nuclear fuel, as defined in Appendix E of the Standard Contract. The term
&quot;canistered fuel&quot; refers to fuel that has been placed in a sealed, multi-assembly
canister at the Purchaser's site with the intent of not re-opening the canister prior to its delivery to
a Department of Energy (the Department or DOE) facility. Such a canister may be dual or
multi-purpose. 
<P>
 This plan also identifies the specific information that must be collected for MC&amp;A
purposes. A determination of the system (electronic and/or conventional) that will be required to
store and retrieve this information in order to accomplish item control and continuity of
knowledge has not been made at this time. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A5"> <B> 1.2 DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This plan is organized into five sections, followed by references, a list of acronyms and a
glossary. The main sections are: Introduction, Requirements, Data Validation, Item Verification,
and Procedures. 
<P>
 Section 2, Requirements, discusses the basis for the development of this plan and explains the
need for expanding the process beyond the scope of the Standard Contract. The specific
requirements that the verification process must meet are discussed in detail. 
<P>
 Section 3, Data Validation, identifies the specific data that will be collected during the
verification process and describes, conceptually, how the data will be validated. This information
will serve as the basis for establishing &quot;continuity of knowledge&quot; of the special
nuclear material (SNM) content of the waste, which is necessary to comply with MC&amp;A
requirements, and must therefore be permanently retained. 
<P>
 Section 4, Item Verification is the confirmation of the characteristics and identity of the waste
being delivered through physical inspection, as opposed to the validation of information
concerning the waste. The item verification process is crucial to meeting the system goal of
avoiding the necessity of re-opening sealed canisters for safeguards-related reasons once they
have been sealed at a Purchaser's site. This verification will take place when a canister is sealed
and when waste is accepted by the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
(OCRWM). 
<P>
 Finally, Section 5 identifies the procedures that must be developed in order to implement the
process discussed in this Plan. Included in these detailed procedures will be a detailed checklist
that will be used to ensure that all actions necessary to accomplish verification are completed.

Public Law 97-425, the &quot;Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982&quot; (NWPA), as amended
by Public Law 100-203, the &quot;Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987,&quot;
establishes Federal responsibility for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level
radioactive waste (HLW). The NWPA also established OCRWM to carry out theses functions of
the Department. Under this authority, OCRWM promulgated the Standard Contract, which
identifies, in general terms, the waste form data which must be provided to the Department upon
delivery and transfer of title. These data requirements include, among other things, the data
needed to verify the quantity and certain characteristics of the material to be accepted. 
<P>
 An analysis was conducted to identify all regulations applicable to the development of a
Safeguards and Security program contained in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The 
<I>
Integrated Safeguards and Security Regulatory Analysis (ISSRA - Reference 2)
</I>

 documents the results of this analysis. This analysis served as a source of the requirements that
pertain to verification. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A7"> <B> 2.1 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN THE STANDARD
CONTRACT </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Article VI.B.2 of the Standard Contract requires that verification be performed on all SNF and
HLW that is accepted into the CRWMS. Specifically, the article states, 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
 During cask loading and prior to acceptance by the Department for transportation to the
Department's facility, the SNF and/or HLW description of the shipping lot shall be subject to
verification by the Department. To the extent the SNF and/or HLW is consistent with the
description submitted and approved, in accordance with Appendices E and F, the Department
agrees to accept such SNF and/or HLW for disposal when the Department has verified the SNF
and/or HLW description, determined the material is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled
and ready for transportation, and has taken custody, as evidenced in writing, of the material at the
Purchaser's site, f.o.b. carrier. A properly executed off-site radioactive shipment record
describing cask contents must be prepared by the Purchaser along with a signed certification
which states: 'This is to certify that the above-named materials are properly described, classified,
packaged, marked and labeled and are in proper condition for transfer according to the applicable
regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation.'&quot; 
<P>
</DL>
 Appendix E, 
<I>
 General Specifications
</I>
, specifies the categories for classifying spent nuclear fuel for delivery and Appendix F, 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Fuel
</I>
, allows the Purchaser to describe, in detail, the specific fuel that will be delivered in a given
allocation. While these two forms are specifically referenced as the method of accomplishing
verification, they may be replaced with a more comprehensive set of forms, as discussed in
Section 3.1. 
<P>
 This verification plan is written to implement the technical and regulatory requirements for
verification, as well as to allow for the attainment of other Program goals, as discussed in Section
2.2. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A8"> <B> 2.2 OTHER VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS </B> </A>
</H3>
<P>
 The CRWMS is being designed and implemented to meet all applicable Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) regulations for the protection of SNF. If the CRWMS is chosen for the
imposition of international safeguards, this will include the requirements contained in Title 10
Code of Federal Regulations part 75 (10 CFR 75). This obligates the US to comply with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the safeguarding of SNM contained within
SNF. Material considered to be SNM is defined in 10 CFR 73. Since some of the elements of the
CRWMS will be required to obtain licenses from the NRC, the designs will be required to
incorporate a Safeguards and Security (S&amp;S) Program that complies with NRC S&amp;S
requirements. As part of this S&amp;S Program, an MC&amp;A plan will be implemented. To
allow for this implementation, the 
<I>
Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Material Control and Accounting Program
Plan
</I>
 (OCRWM MC&amp;A Plan - Reference 3) was developed.


<A NAME="FOOTBODY_1"></A>
<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_1">*</A></SUP>
 This plan discusses the MC&amp;A requirements for all elements of the waste management
system. These responsibilities include collection of shipment information from Purchasers, data
verification, and management of a central database. The information collected from the
Purchasers must support the overall MC&amp;A Plan goal of establishing &quot;continuity of
knowledge&quot; for the SNF and/or HLW entering the CRWMS. In order to establish this
continuity of knowledge, some information will be required that was not anticipated in the
Standard Contract. This Verification Plan includes the collection of this additional information,
which becomes the basic data for MC&amp;A once the SNF and/or HLW is accepted. 
<P>
 &quot;Verification,&quot; as such, is not explicitly referred to in NRC regulations. In general,
NRC relies on the licensee to produce and adhere to a performance-based MC&amp;A plan. That
is, the licensees develop and implement their own program. NRC then ensures the licensee meets
these commitments by independent records audits and facility inspections. CRWMS facilities
(interim storage Facility and/or mined geologic disposal facility) will be licensed by the NRC.
While an interim storage facility is not currently being pursued as a component of the waste
management system, there is the possibility that future plans may include such a facility. Even if
an interim storage facility is not utilized, the NRC has informed OCRWM that the safeguards
requirements for such a facility (which include MC&amp;A) will be applied to the MGDS. To
allow for this, the MC&amp;A Plan commits to meeting the requirements of a storage facility
contained in 10 CFR 72.72 through 72.78. These paragraphs detail the specific reporting and
record-keeping for waste in storage. Among the requirements are &quot;...the estimated quantity
of radioactive material per item (including special nuclear material in spent fuel)...&quot;. In
addition, NRC requires submission of the DOE/NRC Nuclear Material Transaction Report (Form
741) whenever SNM is transferred between item control areas, and the semi-annual submission
of the DOE/NRC Material Balance Report (Form 742) thereafter. 
<p>
While the NRC seeks to enforce licensee commitments to a performance-based MC&amp;A
Plan, the
IAEA's goal is to prevent diversion of SNM by the State. Unlike the NRC, the IAEA considers
the State itself (including the NRC) to be the adversary, or the party diverting SNM for
non-peaceful purposes. Therefore, verification to the IAEA consists of those activities which
permit the IAEA to independently confirm the State/operator declaration of the nature and
quantity of the nuclear material. To assure the independence of its determinations, the IAEA may
employ either their own methods and techniques (e.g., tamper-indicating devices, cameras, or
measurements), or IAEA may utilize State/operator methods and techniques that have been
accorded prior IAEA approval and which can be &quot;authenticated&quot; by technical means.
The requirements for IAEA safeguards are contained in the IAEA document, 
<I>
Safeguards Criteria 1991-1995 (Reference 4)
</I> . The United States' agreement to implement IAEA safeguards (Reference 5) is codified in
10 CFR 75. 
<P>
 The entire purpose of the IAEA system is to enable the IAEA to determine that no material has
been withdrawn from locations where its safeguards have been applied. The IAEA has used a
variety of methods to provide these assurances in the past. For example, dual containment and
surveillance (C/S) is provided to assure &quot;continuity of knowledge&quot;. This C/S is
provided by two functionally independent means, where the methods utilized do not have a
common failure mode. A different level of performance is needed whenever material is prepared
for introduction into a situation which IAEA identifies as &quot;difficult to access&quot;. This
classification clearly applies to loaded sealed canisters (canistered fuel), since the individual
spent fuel assemblies become difficult to access once they are sealed in a canister. Consideration
of these IAEA requirements leads to the conclusion that before being placed into a sealed
canister, individual assemblies may have to be item identified and item counted. Further, IAEA
may conduct non-destructive assay (NDA) testing to assure that the assemblies are as claimed
and have not been replaced with other material. 
<P>
 The collection of data adequate to meet IAEA requirements on the identification and SNM
content of the individual assemblies placed into each sealed canister is provided for in this
verification plan. This data has been collected by OCRWM and the Nuclear Material
Management and Safeguard System for over thirteen years, and will continue to be collected as
sealed canisters begin to be loaded. However, because the use of NDA equipment on a
Purchaser's site would involve site licensing conditions, the imposition of the specific NDA
requirements necessary to meet IAEA standards for difficult to access material at utility sites,
which will require action by individual utilities, is the responsibility of the NRC. The NRC has
begun discussions with the IAEA regarding the implementation of these requirements
(Reference 6)
 . 
<P>
 In developing this Verification Plan, the challenge was to establish a system which will meet
IAEA requirements by requiring utilities to provide the necessary information as inexpensively
and as non-intrusively as possible, and to do so under the NRC regulatory framework. If the
decision is made to deploy sealed canisters, this should be accomplished before the first sealed
canister is loaded, which could possibly occur in 1996. In addition to these time and
non-intrusiveness constraints, OCRWM is limited to implementing this Verification Plan
through the Standard Contract and DOE/NRC Forms 741 and 742. 
<BR>
 the set of regulatory requirements discussed above, a set of specific objectives was developed for
this Verification Plan. In order to meet the specific requirements of the Standard Contract and the
overall goals related to development of an MC&amp;A Plan, this Verification Plan establishes
the conceptual basis for the development of procedures to verify the following: 
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
 that the description of the SNF and/or HLW to be accepted by the Department is correct and
consistent with Appendices E and F of the Standard Contract (as required by 10 CFR 961.11
Article VI.B.2 and 10 CFR 72.72-72.78) 
<P>
<DD>
 that the material is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled, and ready for transportation (as
required by 10 CFR 961.11 Article VI.B.2) 
<P>
<DD>
 that the appropriate documents have been executed for the transfer of title (as required by 10
CFR 961.11 Article VI.B.2) 
<P>
<DD>
 that an off-site radioactive shipment record describing the cask contents has been properly
submitted (as required by 10 CFR 961.11 Article VI.B.2 and 10 CFR 72.72-72.78) 
<P>
<DD>
 that all information required to establish continuity of knowledge for the SNF and/or HLW to be
delivered, from the standpoint of OCRWM, has been collected (as required by the MGDS
MC&amp;A Plan). 
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
<H3> <A NAME="A9"> <CENTER> <B> 3. DATA VALIDATION </B> </CENTER> </A>
</H3>
<P>
Three separate components of verification will be accomplished during the waste acceptance
process: data collection and validation, waste identification and item verification at time of
delivery. This section of the verification plan will discuss the method that will be utilized to
accomplish the first component, collection and validation of the data necessary for acceptance.
Subsequent to collection, the data will be examined to ensure completeness, to avoid basic avoid
basic arithmetical errors in the submission process, and to document the consistency of the data.
Section 4 discusses the process for verification of the waste identification and item identification
at time of delivery. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A10"> <B> 3.1 SCOPE OF DATA COLLECTION AND VALIDATION
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Data will be collected under the verification program for two distinct purposes. First, data will
be collected to ensure that the characteristics of the waste to be accepted are documented. This is
required for proper packaging, transportation, storage, and disposal. Secondly, data will be
collected for purposes of MC&amp;A. While much of the data collected will serve both
purposes, some unique data will be required for each purpose. 
<P>
 Data must be submitted describing the physical and radiological characteristics of the material to
ensure that the accepted waste can be safely handled, transported, stored, and disposed of.
Information must include either the radiological and thermal characteristics of the waste or data
which allows them to be calculated as needed. General physical information (length, weight,
configuration, identification) will be needed to allow for adequate planning for receiving the
shipment at the OCRWM facility in terms of the equipment and casks required. Unique
information related to the waste, such as test history and known defects, should also be
documented and retained in a record system. 
<P>
 A complete MC&amp;A program requires that two different conditions be met, item control and
continuity of knowledge. Item control is related to the unique identity of each waste item. The
location and characteristics of all SNM accepted into the waste management system must be
known at all times. The system must also allow for an inspector to locate a specific waste item at
any time. This requirement will dictate that each item accepted is uniquely labeled and that the
identity and current location is recorded. Continuity of knowledge is related to the ability to
document that the waste currently in the system has been monitored and documented subsequent
to fabrication. This requirement will dictate that the history of the waste be documented from the
time it was transferred to the utility from the fabricator until it is finally placed in a repository for
disposal. For commercial SNF, this requirement will dictate that the history of the SNF be
documented from the time it was transferred to the utility from the fabricator until it is finally
placed in a repository for disposal. 
<P>
 From a thorough review of the regulations applicable to spent nuclear fuel, the MC&amp;A Plan
identifies ten general categories of information that must be collected: 
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
 1. Type of waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 2. Form of waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 3. Physical description of waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 4. Physical description of canister, if appropriate 
<BR>
<DD>
 5. Isotopic composition of the waste prior to irradiation 
<BR>
<DD>
 6. Burnup 
<BR>
<DD>
 7. Date of discharge from the reactor 
<BR>
<DD>
 8. Quantity of special nuclear material 
<BR>
<DD>
 9. Description of any unusual incidents associated with the use or handling of the waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 10. The results of any measurements, tests, inspections, or observations associated with the
waste. 
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
 From these general categories, a list of specific necessary information has been developed. In
order to satisfy the above information needs, the following information will be collected once the
specific waste to be delivered has been identified: 
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
 1. A unique identification number. For SNF, this will be the manufacturer's assigned
identification number, while canisters will have a separate identification number. This
identification number must be unique at least within the inventory of each individual reactor. In
this way, this identification number can be combined with the Purchaser's reactor identification
to form a completely unique number for purposes of item control. 
<P>
<DD>
 2. Indication of type of waste. For the majority of waste accepted, this will be either Boiling
Water Reactor or Pressurized Water Reactor spent fuel. There will be an &quot;other&quot;
category to accommodate deliveries of non-light water reactor spent fuel or non-fuel-bearing
components. A more complete description of the waste will be obtained through other items,
discussed below. 
<P>
<DD>
 3. Drawing file reference. This will indicate the drawing that describes the waste to be delivered
(e.g. Westinghouse 17x17). If no drawing for the specific waste to be delivered is available, the
Purchaser will be asked to supply a drawing, and a new file will be created. The goal is to
minimize the burden on utilities regarding the submission of assembly drawings, while at the
same time ensuring that adequate drawings are available for all waste to be accepted. While
duplicate drawings may inadvertently be collected, the intent is to collect only one drawing of
each assembly type and then reference this drawing for all deliveries of that type, regardless of
whether the same utility is delivering the assembly. From the drawing, the active length of the
fuel assembly, the cladding material, the overall assembly length, and the overall assembly
weight can be determined. 
<P>
<DD>
 4. Initial enrichment and uranium mass. The weight percent initial Uranium-235 (U-235)
enrichment and total initial uranium mass must be reported to allow for the calculation of
isotopic content as well as for criticality calculations. 
<P>
<DD>
 5. Post irradiation isotopic content. Specifically, U-234, U-235, U-236, U-238, Plutonium-238
(Pu-238), Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241, and Pu-242 content (in weight percent concentrations) at the
time that the spent nuclear fuel is permanently discharged from the reactor (final cycle end date)
must be calculated and submitted, and each must be reported separately. 
<P>
<DD>
 6. Post irradiation Uranium and Plutonium content. Total fissile Uranium and Plutonium content
(in grams) must be calculated and submitted for each assembly as of the date of discharge. This
information must be collected to allow the Department to submit DOE/NRC Forms 741 and 742
after the Department becomes responsible for reporting to NRC on the SNM. 
<P>
<DD>
 7. Final discharge burnup. The final discharge burnup of the SNF must be reported to allow for
the calculation of isotopic contents. 
<P>
<DD>
 8. Date of final discharge. This the date that the fuel was last irradiated, which is necessary to
perform decay calculations. 
<P>
<DD>
 9. Description of any unusual incidents associated with the use or handling of the waste or any
changes, whether intentional or accidental, to the fissile material content. This should include a
discussion of anything that might affect the way that the waste is handled, packaged, transported,
stored, or disposed of. Any removal of rods within the assembly must be described. 
<P>
<DD>
 10. The results of any measurements, tests, inspections, or observations associated with the
waste. This should not include the results of any testing that may be determined necessary for
acceptance (such as burnup measurements), but should instead include any measurements, tests,
inspections or observations that have been conducted by the Purchaser independent of these
requirements. 
<P>
<DD>
 11. Fabricator's/Receiver's Form 741. A copy of the DOE/NRC Form 741 that was generated
when the fresh fuel was transferred to the utility from the fabricator, including any changes to the
record made by the receiver, will be necessary to establish an initiation point for the continuity of
knowledge regarding each assembly. 
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
 The above information is anticipated to be collected through the 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form developed by OCRWM. If it is determined to be appropriate, the current Appendix F form
in the Standard Contract will be modified to include all of this information or replaced by the 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form. This information will be required prior to acceptance. 
<BR>
 crucial aspect of the entire verification process will be the storage of this data once it is
collected. Not only must the information be recorded, but the records themselves must be
controlled, since they represent the records that will establish the basis for compliance with
MC&amp;A requirements. Appropriate controls must be imposed to protect the information, and
the information must be accessible for the generation of necessary reports. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A11"> <B> 3.2 THE DATA VALIDATION PROCESS </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Data validation will be initiated upon receipt of a 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form. The complete process for validating this information will be fully developed as the
procedures for implementing this plan are written. At this time, the assumption is that validation
will be accomplished by first confirming that all necessary information has been submitted for
each waste item and then comparing the information submitted to a set of known bounding
parameters, which will be based upon the information previously submitted to OCRWM. If a
data item is identified that falls outside of the bounding parameters, the Purchaser will be
requested to confirm that the value as reported is correct. If the Purchaser confirms that the value
is correct, the value will be retained. 
<P>
 This validation process assumes that all information is submitted under an NRC-approved
Quality Assurance (QA) program. No information will be accepted which is not submitted under
such a program. Because the NRC requires exhaustive confirmation of licensee calculations and
records, requiring the information to be submitted to OCRWM under an NRC QA program will
eliminate the need for OCRWM to perform any additional confirmation exercises. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A12"> <CENTER> <B> 4. PHYSICAL VERIFICATION </B>
</CENTER> </A> </H3>
<P>
The verification process described in Section 3, collection and validation of the data necessary
for acceptance, will be initiated when the form describing the waste to be delivered is received.
In addition to this, there are two other components of verification that must be accomplished
prior to acceptance: waste identification and validation. While the collection and validation of
data are administrative processes, these two components are considered to be physical aspects of
verification, since they involve the verification of waste characteristics that which can be
physically observed. These components are described in this section. 
<P>
 OCRWM has not yet identified any reason to conduct measurements for purposes of waste
acceptance. Therefore, this plan does not include the requirement for any measurements.
However, Purchasers should be aware of the circumstances


<A NAME="FOOTBODY_2"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_2">**</A></SUP>

which may require waste measurements, even though OCRWM will not
require them for waste to be accepted. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A13"> <B> 4.1 WASTE IDENTIFICATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The first component of the physical verification program is verification of the identity of the
individual items. For commercial SNF, this will consist of verifying the assembly number, and
must be accomplished immediately prior to emplacement of the assembly into either a canister
that will be sealed (i.e., welded closed with no intent of reopening) or a transportation cask. 
<P>
 Verification of the identification of the assembly will be accomplished by the Purchasers under
an NRC-approved QA procedure. It is assumed that this verification will be accomplished similar
to methods which have been previously approved by the NRC that are currently in use at utility
sites for the tracking of SNF location. For example, this verification may be accomplished by two
individuals independently reading the number of the assembly, recording this number on paper,
and then comparing the two records. The verified information will be recorded on a form
developed by OCRWM to establish a continuity-of-knowledge record for the waste. If sealed
storage canisters are used, OCRWM intends for this information to be recorded at the time the
canister is sealed. While this is not required, completing the form at the time of canister sealing
will maximize the probability that all required information is recorded in an acceptable level of
detail. Placing waste in a sealed canister will also require the recording of the canister's unique
identification number. 
<P>
 The loading of sealed canisters and/or transportation casks to be used at a facility will not
normally be witnessed by an OCRWM representative. The Purchasers will be responsible for
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the loading data. For those loadings accomplished
prior to the implementation of this plan, the Purchasers will be required to complete the records
indicating the identity of the SNF in the sealed canister(s) and document that the information was
gathered and reported using NRC-approved QA procedures. If this cannot be documented, the
canister will have to be re-opened to verify the contents. 
<P>
 If sealed canisters are used, specific safeguards may be required in order to ensure that the
contents are not tampered with. As discussed previously, if the IAEA determines that they will
conduct safeguards activities at Purchaser sites, they may require NDA to be performed on any
SNF placed in a sealed canister and dual C/S once they are sealed. These additional requirements
would be imposed by the NRC upon the specific site affected. CRWMS will not require sealed
canisters to be opened for verification purposes if the above OCRWM requirements have been
complied with

<A NAME="FOOTBODY_3"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_3">***</A></SUP>
. While OCRWM cannot provide complete assurance that IAEA or NRC will not require sealed
canisters to be opened, if such a demand is made and the above requirements are followed,
OCRWM will investigate available options to insulate Purchasers from the impacts of this
re-opening. OCRWM believes that the probability is very low of either the NRC or IAEA
requiring a sealed canister which has met these requirements to be opened for purposes of
verification. Some sealed canisters may have to be opened for reasons other than verification,
such as canister performance issues. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A14"> <B> 4.2 ITEM VERIFICATION AT TIME OF DELIVERY </B>
</A> </H3>
<P>
 The final component of verification will consist of verifying that the waste to be accepted by the
CRWMS is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled, and ready for transportation, and that
appropriate documents have been executed for the transfer of title. This verification will occur
immediately before title is transferred. 
<P>
 This component of verification will include confirmation that the identity of the waste is as
expected, whether non-canistered or canistered spent fuel is being delivered. Purchasers will
identify the specific waste they intend to deliver on a 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form, described earlier. This form will be required for delivery of a canister in the same manner
as it will be required for delivery of bare fuel. The specific waste offered for delivery will thus
have to match the waste identified in the form. As in the case of the verification process
described for individual assembly identification, verification of either the identity of the
non-canistered SNF placed in a transport cask or of a canister to be delivered will be
accomplished by the Purchaser using a method currently approved by the NRC for item
identification. 
<P>
 OCRWM will conduct any required inspection of the shipment and transport carrier required to
ensure that the shipment meets all regulations and is prepared for travel. Title will not be
transferred, and thus the waste will not be transported offsite, until all documentation is in place
to demonstrate that all regulations have been complied with. 
<BR>
<H3> <A NAME="A15"> <CENTER> <B> 5. PROCEDURES </B> </CENTER> </A> </H3>
<P>
This section identifies and briefly describes the procedures that must be developed in order to
implement the process discussed in this plan. These procedures will be developed separately
subsequent to the acceptance of this plan. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A16"> <B> 5.1 SNF DATA VALIDATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The purpose of this procedure will be to define the process to be used to collect and store
information regarding the waste to be delivered to ensure that the waste can be safely handled,
transported, stored and disposed of. The information submitted by Purchasers will be examined
to ensure completeness, arithmetical correctness, and consistency of data. If unexpected values
are reported, they will be individually confirmed. 
<P>
 A critical part of the data validation procedures will be a description of the appropriate actions to
be taken if unexpected information is identified. Although addressing every possible unexpected
submission is not feasible, the procedures will identify generic actions to be taken to confirm that
unexpected data was intended and not typographical in nature. 
<P>
 Once the data has been validated, the data must be entered into an MC&amp;A database. The
developed procedure will describe the necessary format and content of the forms to be used to
input this data into the records database. Procedure 5.4, MC&amp;A Data Collection and
Processing, will describe the process by which this data is stored and protected. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A17"> <B> 5.2 SNF LOADING VERIFICATION AND CANISTER
SURVEILLANCE </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The procedure will describe the actions required to accomplish individual waste item
identification verification in these situations, as well as the level of containment/surveillance that
will be required. This procedure will describe the activities required prior to loading SNF into
any type of sealed canister. This includes canisters not intended to be re-opened even for
purposes of disposal, including transportable storage casks for which disposal overpacks could be
designed, as well as the activities required prior to loading dual-purpose casks/canisters which
can be used for storage and transportation, but will be reopened at the repository. The procedure
will describe the format which must be followed in documenting and submitting this information
to OCRWM, since OCRWM personnel will not normally witness these activities. 
<P>
 Once the SNF loading verification has been completed at a Purchaser site, the verification data
must be entered into the MC&amp;A records database. This procedure will describe the format
and content of the forms to be used to input verification data into the database. Procedure 5.4,
MC&amp;A Data Collection and Processing, will describe the process by which this verification
input data is stored and protected in the records database. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A18"> <B> 5.3 ACCEPTANCE/SHIPMENT PHASE VERIFICATION
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This procedure will describe the activities required to verify that material to be accepted by the
CRWMS is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled, and ready for transportation, and that
appropriate documents have been executed for the transfer of title. The procedure will address
the acceptance of bare spent fuel as well as dual- or triple-purpose casks and canisters. The
procedure will also identify the qualifications for the OCRWM personnel who are required to be
present during SNF acceptance. 
<P>
 Procedures will be developed for documenting the identity of the waste being delivered, whether
it is canistered or non-canistered. The individual identities of the waste items and the sealed
canister, if used, must be documented prior to acceptance, via an approved NRC method of item
identification. 
<P>
 There is a possibility that transportable canisters may be used in the future at Purchaser sites
prior to the development of appropriate verification procedures by the Department. This
procedure will specify the actions required to determine whether existing records for SNF in such
transportable canisters are sufficient (from a verification standpoint) to allow the Department to
accept the unopened canisters, or whether opening of the canisters prior to acceptance is required. 
<P>
 Once the acceptance/shipment phase verification has been completed at a Purchaser site, the
verification data must be entered into the MC&amp;A records database. This procedure will
describe the format and content of the forms to be used to input verification data into the
database. Procedure 5.4, MC&amp;A Data Collection and Processing, will describe the process
by which this verification input data is stored and protected in the records database. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A19"> <B> 5.4 MC&amp;A DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This procedure will describe the process by which verification data is stored and protected in the
MC&amp;A records database. This procedure will describe how information from forms
specified in the previously-described procedures is input into the records database, how access to
the MC&amp;A and other verification data is controlled, and how and to whom the verification
data will be disseminated.

<DL>
<DD>
 Canistered Fuel: Spent nuclear fuel that is placed in a seal-welded canister prior to delivery with
no intent of re-opening. It is assumed that under normal circumstances, OCRWM will not
physically observe the identity of canistered fuel prior to acceptance. 
<P>
<DD>
 Continuity of Knowledge: The ability to document the quantities and general characteristics of
all SNM under one's control from a specified time to the present. Within the CRWMS, continuity
of knowledge for commercial SNF will be established from the point when the fuel was delivered
to the utility by the fabricator, using the fabricator's NRC/DOE Form 741 as the initiating
document. Any alterations in the quantities or general characteristics of the SNM subsequent to
this point will have to be documented in order to establish continuity of knowledge for the waste. 
<P>
<DD>
 Difficult to Access: A designation given to certain storage applications by the IAEA. By
applying this designation, the IAEA is stating that there is sufficient confidence in the continued
presence of any SNM that periodic remeasurement of the SNM quantities is unnecessary,
provided that dual containment/surveillance measures are maintained. 
<P>
<DD>
 Item: The fundamental unit for purposes of verification. Within the CRWMS, this is a spent fuel
assembly; no tracking of individual items smaller than an assembly (i.e., fuel rods) will be
accomplished. 
<P>
<DD>
 Item Control: The ability to document that, subsequent to entering a safeguarded system, all
items have been continually within one's control, with no opportunity for unauthorized access. To
demonstrate this, all items must be able to be located within the system upon demand. 
<P>
<DD>
 Item Control Area: A defined area with specific boundaries at a safeguarded facility over which
no safeguarded item is allowed to pass without being accounted for and documented, and in
which continuous control is exercised over the item. 
<P>
<DD>
 Validation: The process whereby data submitted is checked for legibility, reproducibility,
completeness, arithmetical correctness and consistency. It is meant to distinguish this process
from verifying the data, which implies an auditing process. In the case of data validation, the data
will be required to be submitted under an NRC-approved QA program, and thus verification will
not be necessary. However, validation will be performed to ensure that the data is complete and
to limit the possibility for typographical errors. 
<P>
<DD>
 Verification: The process used to demonstrate that, for all SNM within the CRWMS,
appropriate safeguards are in place and that the material is being handled and stored
appropriately from a safeguards standpoint. 
<P>
<DD>
 Waste: For this revision, this term refers exclusively to commercial SNF, as defined in 10 CFR
961.11.

 The MGDS MC&amp;A Plan was developed to cover all aspects of MC&amp;A within the
CRWMS related to the delivery of canistered SNF. The MGDS MC&amp;A Plan is currently
under revision to include a discussion of the MC&amp;A requirements for the delivery of
uncanistered SNF. As part of this revision, the title will be changed to the

 to more accurately reflect the applicability to all aspects of the CRWMS.

 The most likely measurement to be required is a burnup measurement, which may be necessary
to account for burnup credit in the loading of canisters. Such measurements, if required, will be
accomplished by the Purchasers, since they will be responsible for loading the canisters
according to the Certificate of Compliance. Therefore, OCRWM will not be involved in these
measurements and will assume that all regulatory requirements regarding canister loading have
been met when the waste is identified as ready for acceptance. 

In addition, the IAEA may decide to conduct NDA analysis of the individual items prior to their
placement in a sealed canister. This NDA would be conducted by the IAEA to assure that the
SNM contents of the items has not been diverted. Because the material would be classified as
&quot;difficult-to-access,&quot; this assurance would be required at both the gross and partial
defects level. A gross defect in the measured quantity is defined by the IAEA as a 100 percent
difference between the measured amount of material and declared amount, while a partial defect
is defined as a 50 percent difference between the measured and declared amount. If this NDA is
done in advance of loading, dual containment/surveillance of the assemblies while in storage may
be required to ensure that the items are not tampered with. This is not to imply that a decision on
this requirement has been made or that OCRWM believes such measurements are necessary.
However, Purchasers should be aware that the possibility exists that IAEA will determine such
measurements are necessary for purposes of establishing initial inventories of SNM. If such a
determination is made, IAEA will perform the measurements; OCRWM will not be involved
with this procedure.

 OCRWM has been informed by the NRC Office of Arms Control and Non-Proliferation,
International Safeguards Division, that if canisters are sealed prior to IAEA's decision regarding
the implementation of international safeguards within the CRWMS, IAEA will not require such
canisters to be opened for purposes of IAEA verification.
