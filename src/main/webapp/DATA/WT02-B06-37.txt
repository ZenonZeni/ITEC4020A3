<STRONG>STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON INTRODUCTION OF<BR>
&quot;PROMOTION OF COMMERCE ON-LINE IN THE DIGITAL ERA&quot; (PRO-CODE)<BR>
THURSDAY MAY 2, 1996</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
        I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators in supporting
legislation to encourage the development and use of strong, privacy-enhancing
technologies for the Internet by rolling back the out-dated restrictions on the
export of strong cryptography.<BR>
<BR>
        As an Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting individual
privacy and encouraging the development of the Net as a secure and trusted
communications medium.  Current export restrictions only allow American
companies to export primarily weak encryption technology.  The current strength
of encryption the U.S. government will allow out of the country is so weak that,
according to a January 1996 study conducted by world-renowned cryptographers, a
pedestrian hacker can crack the codes in a matter of hours.  A foreign
intelligence agency can crack the current 40-bit codes in seconds.<BR>
<BR>
        Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet and similar
interactive communications technologies by Americans to obtain critical medical
services, to conduct business, to be entertained and communicate with their
friends, raises special concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of those
communications.  I have long been concerned about these issues, and have worked
over the past decade to protect privacy and security for our wire and electronic
communications.  Encryption technology provides an effective way to ensure that
only the people we choose can read our communications.<BR>
<BR>
        Encryption is critical for electronic commerce really to flourish on the
Internet, and for computer users to trust that their communciations will remain
private.  Today, I have sent out an open letter  to the Internet about this
encryption legislation.  So that people reading the letter can be assured that
it is really me sending it, I am using a popular encryption program called
&quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot;, or &quot;PGP&quot;,  to authenticate my signature.  This is yet
another practical use of encryption, and an important one for electronic
commerce.<BR>
<BR>
        Maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer
communications and information is very important to all of us both here and
abroad.  I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet about how human
rights groups in the Balkans have had their computers confiscated during raids
by security police seeking to find out the identities of people who have
complained about abuses.  The human rights groups have been able to get for free
from the Internet an encryption program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to
protect their computer communications and files. These encrypted files are
undecipherable by the police and the names of the people who entrust their lives
to the human rights groups are safe.<BR>
<BR>
        The encryption bill, called the &quot;Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the
Digital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996,&quot; which we introduce today, would:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Bar any government-mandated use of any particular encryption
system, including key escrow systems and affirm the right of American citizens
to use whatever form of encryption they choose domestically;
<P>
<LI>Loosen export restrictions on encryption products so that
American companies are able to export any generally available or mass market
encryption products without obtaining government approval; and
<P>
<LI>Limit the authority of the federal government to set standards
for encryption products used by businesses and individuals, particularly
standards which result in products with limited key lengths and key escrow.
</UL>
        This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with Senator Burns
and other congressional colleagues this year. Both bills call for an overhaul of
this country's export restrictions on encryption, and, if enacted, would quickly
result in the widespread availability of strong, privacy protecting
technologies. Both bills also prohibit a government-mandated key escrow
encryption system.  While PRO-CODE would limit the authority of the Commerce
Department to set encryption standards for use by private individuals and
businesses, the first bill we introduced, called the &quot;Encrypted Communications
Privacy Act&quot;, S.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement to
follow to obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to read the plaintext of
encrypted communications obtained under court order or other lawful process.<BR>
<BR>
        To satisfy national security and law enforcement concerns, both bills
have important exceptions to restrict encryption exports for military end-uses,
or to terrorist designated or embargoed countries, such as Cuba or North Korea.<BR>
<BR>
        I know this is not enough to satisfy our national security and law
enforcement agencies, who fear that the widespread use of strong encryption will
undercut their ability to eavesdrop on terrorists or other criminals.<BR>
<BR>
        BUT U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS WILL NOT KEEP ENCRYPTION OUT OF THE HANDS OF
CRIMINALS; THESE CONTROLS ONLY HURT LEGITIMATE USERS AND AMERICAN BUSINESS.  Any
criminal intent on encrypting his computer information or messages to avoid
getting caught can go into any Egghead store and buy off-the-shelf Lotus Notes
or Norton Utilities encryption program, both of which contain strong encryption
that cannot be exported. It is then a simple matter just to slip the software
disc into his pocket to smuggle out of the country.<BR>
<BR>
        Actually, it is even simpler than that for a foreign terrorist or any
criminal to get ahold of strong encryption. They don't even have to leave home.
With a computer, a modem and a telephone line, they could download for free off
the Internet from anywhere in the world strong encryption, such as Pretty Good
Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
        Strong encryption has an important use as a crime prevention shield, to
stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private computer
files and stealing valuable proprietary information. We should be encouraging
the use of strong encryption to prevent certain types of computer and online
crime.<BR>
<BR>
        It is clear that the current policy towards encryption exports is
hopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs of individuals and
businesses in the global marketplace.
<BR>
        In one recent example, a major high-tech firm had a multi-million dollar
contract to sell digital television systems to China put at risk due to our
export regulations. Why? The company suffered lengthy delays in getting export
approval because the systems contained encryption technology to scramble TV
signals--a critical component of the system to protect the intellectual property
rights of the programming carried by the signal. Foreign competitors seeking to
get into the vast China market were ready and willing to step into the company's
place if it were unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. Two weeks after
the contractual delivery date, the company finally got the export approval it
sought. This example is particularly ironic since in trade negotiations, the
United States has strongly urged China to protect intellectual property rights
better.<BR>
<BR>
        Encryption expert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted that
current U.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption are having a
&quot;deleterious effect ... on our country's ability to develop a reliable and
trustworthy information infrastructure.&quot;  This sentiment is echoed by the chief
executive officers of 13 major U.S. computer systems companies, including IBM,
Apple, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and others, which recently reported
that &quot;encryption is the most practical and effective means to protect valuable
and confidential electronic information traveling across open networks.  The
availability of effective encryption is necessary to realize the full potential
of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII).&quot;<BR>
<BR>
        The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our national
encryption policy on the right course. The PRO-CODE bill, as well as the
&quot;Encrypted Communications Privacy Act,&quot; S.1587, are much-needed steps to reform
our nation's cryptography policy.<BR>
