<h1>Additional Statement of Clinton M. Hester</h1>

<p>Taxation of Marihuana<br>
Wednesday, April 28, 1937<br>
<br>
House of Representatives<br>
Comittee on Ways and Means<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<br>
Additional Statement of Clinton M. Hester, Assistant General
Counsel, Office of General Counsel for the Department of the
Treasury.<br>
<br>
MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman, I prepared last evening a brief summary
of the effect of the marihuana bill upon legitimate industry
which I thought would be of interest to the committee.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: If there is no objection, the statement referred
to will be inserted in the record.</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: The statement I have referred to is as follows</p>

<p>All legitimate users of marihuana are exempted from the
provisions of this bill which imposes taxes upon transfers of
marihuana and require such transfers to be made on order forms
obtained from the collector of internal revenue, except
purchasers of marihuana seeds for use in the making of bird seed,
or marihuana seeds as bird see, and purchasers of the flowering
tops and leaves of marihuana for use in the making of the refined
drug product.</p>

<p>These legitimate users of marihuana who are exempted from
these transfer taces and order form requirements, are purchasers
of the mature stalk of marihuana for use in the making of fiber
products such as twine, purchasers of marihuana seed for the
further planting of marihuana and the manufacture of oil, and
purchasers of such oil for use in the manufacture of paints and
varnishes.</p>

<p>Although all of the above manufacturers or dealers who use
marihuana are exempted from the transfer tax and order form
provisions of the bill (with exceptions noted), they are,
nevertheless, required to pay occupational taxes and register
with the collector of internal revenue, with two exception:
Dealers in paintt and varnish which contains marihuana; and
manufacturers of and dealers in fiber products manufacturedd from
the mature stock of marihuana. Likewise, all producers of
marihuna, whether they grow marihuana for hemp fiber, for seeds,
orr for the drug, must register as producers and pay the
occuptational tax.</p>

<p>I. Hemp. Since the definition of marihuana in the bill
excludes the mature stalk of the plant and any product or
manufacgture of such stalk such as twine, all hemp, fiber, or
cordage manufacturers and dealers would not be subject to any
provision of the bill. It is possible too safely exclude all such
persons from the purview of the bill because the mature stalk
does not contain any of the harmful drug ingredient. However, any
person who gros marihuana, even if for the sole purpose of slae
to a hemp manufacturer, would have to pay an occupations tac as a
producer. the reason for this is that such production cannot be
limited to the mature stalks of such plant since the stalk cannot
be grown without also producing the flowering tops and leaves.
Unles the legitimate producer transfers the tops and leaves to a
drug manufacgturere, his product will not be subject to a
transfer tax for the flowering tops and leaves are removed from
the mature stalk and left on the field.</p>

<p>II. Marihuana seed for planting purposes. - All persons whho
produce marihuana for seeds must pay the occupational tax as
producers, but all transfers of marihuana seeds to persons
registered as producers for use by such persons for the further
production of marihuana are exempted from the transfer tax and
order form provisions of the bill.</p>

<p>III. Marihuana as used in the pain and varnish industry.</p>

<p>It appears that there is some use of marihuana seeds for the
production of oil which is sold to paintt and varnish
manufacturers, to be used as a constituent of their products. The
bill requires manufacturers and importers of oil, paint, and
varnish dealers in oil, to pay occupational taxes but exempts
from occupational taxes dealers in paints or varnishes.</p>

<p>The reason why manufacturers and importers must pay the
occupational tax and register is that they will have raw
marihuana in their possession and the reason why their products
are exempt is because the drug cannot be extracted from the
products. However, paiint and varnish and the oil to be used in
paint and varnish would be exempted from the transfer tax. Thus,
a transfer of seed from a marihuana producer to a registered oil
manufacturer would be exempted as would a transfer of the
manufactured oil to a registered paint manufacturer and a
transfer off the completed paint or varnish to a dealer or by a
dealer to the consumer.</p>

<p>IV. Marijuana for medicinal use. All persons who produce,
manufacture, import, or deal in marihuana, or its byproducts for
medical use, as well as practitioners, would be compelled by the
bill to pay occupational taxes. All transfers to manufacturing
chemists, druggists, and practitioners, woudl be sujbect to the
transfer tax and order form requirement but, such persons all
being entitled to reigstry, the transfer tax would amount to only
one dollar per ounce. the final dispensation by a practitioner to
a patient in the course off his professional practice or by
druggists to the patients of such practitioners in pursuance of a
written prescription would, howevver, be exempted from the
transfer tax and order form provisions. Incidentally, it appears
that the marihuana drug is not indispensable to the medical
profession.</p>

<p>V. Bird seed. Since marihuana bird seed contains the drug and
is capable of being used by human beings for smoking purposes,
and since, if negligently disposed of, itt propagates new
marihuana very rapidly, all occupaitional and transfer taxses
imposed by the bill are applicable with respect to bird seed
containing marihuana. Since the ultimate purchaser of th bird
seed could not register under the bill, a transfer to him would
be subject to the prohibitive $100 tax. thus the effect of the
bill is tto prevent the use of marihuana seed in bird seed.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Who is your next witness, Mr. Hester?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman, I would like the committee now to
hear Dr. Munch, a pharmacologist, from Temple University,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Will you give the reporter your full name and the
position you occupy?</p>
