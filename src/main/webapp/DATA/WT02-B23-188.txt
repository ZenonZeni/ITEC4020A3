Continuing Education Opportunities<br>
Virginia Commonwealth University<br>Richmond, Virginia</h2>

For Professionals in Education, Psychology, Social Work, Counseling,
Vocational Rehabilitation, Nursing, and other areas, Continuing Education
Units (CEUs) will be available. Although NOT equivalent to university
undergraduate or graduate credits, CEUs are accepted by many local or
state agencies and professional associations as evidence of professional
growth activities for recertification or clock hours toward renewal.
Since there is a great variability among agencies and professions about if
and how CEUs are accepted, you should determine whether CEUs are
applicable in your individual situation PRIOR to coming to the conference.
The CEUs will be recorded on a Virginia Commonwealth University
transcript, which may be obtained without charge as often as requested. It
is up to the individual, however, to take responsibility for having a
transcript sent to the proper authorities.

<p>One CEU is defined as ten contact hours, so it is possible to earn a
total of 25 CEUs by attending all Conference sessions, Wednesday through
Saturday. A one-time processing fee of $20.00 will be charged regardless
of the number of CEUs earned at the LDA Conference. MasterCard or Visa
credit cards and personal checks may be used.

<p>IMPORTANT: A CEU table in the Conference Registration area will be open
from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m. each morning. To receive CEUs YOU MUST REGlSTER
BEFORE THE OPENING SESSION on the first day that you want CEUs. For
further information, please stop by the CEU desk before attending any
conference sessions.
