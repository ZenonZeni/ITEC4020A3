<B>Guidelines for Publishing in <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</b></I><br>
(approximately 5 printed pages)<br>
August 1996<br>
Journal of The Council for Exceptional Children<p>

<I>TEACHING Exceptional Children (TEC),</I> published six times per year, is a
journal designed specifically for teachers, administrators, and other practitioners who
work with children and youth with disabilities or who are gifted.  As the largest special
education practitioner journal, <I>TEC</I> is received by all members of The
Council for Exceptional Children thereby reaching over 60,000 individuals,
organizations, and libraries around the world. <p>The following information is
designed
to assist authors in preparing materials to
submit to <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children.</I>  This document replaces all
earlier versions.<p><B>Is <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> an
appropriate
journal for
publishing my work? </B><P>
The purpose of <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>  is to advance the
professional
development of the personnel in the
field and provide practical information, resources, and tools for improving the education
and services for children and youth
with disabilities or who are gifted.<P>
Consistent with our purpose, we seek to publish articles that deal with practical
methods and materials for use in a wide
variety of educational settings.<p>
<I>TEC</I> has an open submissions policy and seeks manuscripts from the field on
a
wide variety of practical issues
confronting special education teachers and administrators.  We encourage submissions
that include multiple authors
representing the diversity of professional roles within the field.  <p>
We seek to publish original work that describes:  action research; research with an
applied focus; specific instructional
and management interventions; works that help us understand under-represented
points of view (i.e., children, youth,
families) concerning exceptionality, schooling, or special education;  issues in reform of
service delivery, curriculum, and
roles; strategies for fostering professional development; information pertaining to state
and federal legislation, rules, and
regulations; and issues related to the effectiveness of special education or specific
practices.  Manuscripts on these and similar
topics will be accepted at any time.<p>
<I>TEC </I>will also consider the following types of
manuscripts:<p><b><I>Letters to
the Editor</B></I><p>
Letters to the editor may involve reaction to material appearing in <I>TEC</I> or an
issue in
the field of special education.  Letters are limited to two double-spaced typed pages
with no tables,
figures, footnotes, or references.    Letters are subject to editing and condensation by
the editorial
staff.<P>
<B><I>Product Reviews</B></I><P>
Individuals interested in submitting reviews of books or media should first contact the
editor to
determine <I>TEC's</I> interest and whether a review is already in preparation. 
Evidence of
the reviewer's expertise in the area will be requested.  Reviews are typically limited to
2-4 pages
(including cover page).<P>
<B><I>Topical Series</b></I><P>
Topical Series are composed of 4-6 feature articles by different authors relating to a
single topic.  A topical series is
conceptualized and coordinated by an author with extensive experience and expertise
in the area.  Authors who wish to
assemble a topical series of articles should first contact the Editor to determine
<I>TEC's</I> interest in the specific topic
and whether a similar topic is already in preparation.<P>
Authors are encouraged to be mindful that the purpose of a professional journal is not
to publish all manuscripts having
merit but to select those having the greatest merit given the aims and scope of the
journal within the limitations of available
space.  If you have any questions about the appropriateness of <I>TEACHING
Exceptional Children</I> for publishing
your work, please contact our editorial offices (1-414-229-5260).<p><B>What should
I
know about <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> before I
prepare my manuscript?</b><P>
Authors are encouraged to consider the following guidelines relative to style, format,
length, and person-first language in the
development of a manuscript for <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children.</I><P>
<B><I>Style</B></I><P>
The hallmark of manuscripts accepted for publication in <I>TEACHING Exceptional
Children</I> is their focus on the practical application of knowledge.  We encourage
authors to
avoid jargon and "academic-prose" in favor of a style of writing that engages the reader. 
As
suggested by the literature on improving practice with research, we seek articles that
impact how
teachers think about their work and  provide teachers with tools for improving their
practices.<P>
We seek manuscripts that have a central message and strongly encourage the use of
sidebars or
gray boxes that contain valuable supplementary information (i.e., frameworks,
guidelines, readings
for further study, profiles of the participants, quotes or viewpoints of individuals with a
major stake
in the intervention described).  The editorial staff views these design elements as
essential for three
reasons. <p>
<ol><li>Gray boxes and sidebars allow authors to feature quotes, viewpoints,
or
profiles of individuals from groups that have been under-represented in the literature. 
We are
particularly interested in increasing the number of voices in <I>TEC</I> to reflect
the
diversity
of the children and youth we serve as well as the diversity of professional roles that
provide
services. <p>
<li>Research on adoption of innovation indicates that individuals are at a variety of
levels in
their interest and understanding of an innovation.  As a result, we want to encourage
authors to
recognize this continuum of knowledge and skill and use gray boxes and sidebars to
provide
information that will enable self-directed readers to advance their knowledge and skill
about the
topic whether they are a novice or already fairly well-informed about  the topic. <p>
<li>These tools are essential in preparing visually interesting layouts in the journal.
</ol><p><B><I>Format</b></I><P>
<ol><li>Manuscripts should be well-organized and concise.  They should be
written
in a direct, clear, and
reasonable style.<p>
<LI>All material must be double- spaced, including quotations and references. 
<I>TEC</I> requires that all
manuscripts be double-spaced with 10- or 12-point text in an appropriate font and
one-inch margins. <p>
<LI>Preferred positions of tables and figures should be indicated in the
manuscript.<p>
<LI>For rules governing references and general format, consult:<I> The Publication
Manual of the American
Psychological Association</I> (4th ed., The American Psychological Association,
1994).  In
case of questions concerning style
considerations, authors are encouraged to depart from APA in favor of the
<I>TEC</I>
style guidelines noted above.<p><B><L>Length</b></l><P>
Manuscripts submitted for publication in <I>TEC</I> are usually of two lengths:
<ul><LI>4 double-spaced pages for a one-page feature.  An additional page is
allowed for the cover page as well as the abstract.<p>
<LI>12 double-spaced pages for a feature article.   Indicates total manuscript length,
including the cover page, abstract,
figures, and references. </UL><p>All material must be double-spaced, including
quotations and references.<P>
<B><I>Person-First Language</B></I><P>
Authors are encouraged to write using "person-first" language:  the person precedes
the disability, both figuratively and
literally.  This standard will result in terms such as "people with disabilities" rather than
"the
disabled."<P>
<B>What should I know about submitting my manuscript to <I>TEACHING
Exceptional Children?</b></I><P>
Manuscripts will be accepted for review provided:<P>
<ol><LI>The cover letter indicates that the manuscript has not been published
in
whole or substantial part by
another publisher.<p>
<LI>The manuscript is not being considered concurrently in whole or substantial part
by
another publisher.<p>
<LI>The journal has exclusive option on possible publication for a period of 6 months
following receipt of the
manuscript.<p>
<LI>The author assumes responsibility for publication clearance in the event the
manuscript was presented at a
professional meeting or is the direct product of a project financed by a funding
agency.<p>
<LI>Authors are responsible for the authenticity of all quoted material and
bibliographic
citations from the original
source for quotes in excess of 150 words or for tables or figures reproduced from
published works.<p><LI>The Council for Exceptional Children and the Editor
assume
no responsibility for statements or opinions expressed
by contributors in articles published in <I>TEACHING Exceptional
Children.</I><p><LI>The Council for Exceptional Children retains literary
property rights
on copyrighted articles. Up to 100 copies of
the articles in <I>TEC</I> may be reproduced for nonprofit distribution without
permission from the publisher. All other
forms of reproduction require permission from the
publisher.</OL><p><B><I>Manuscript Submission Checklist</B></I><P>
Prior to mailing your manuscript to <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children,</I> review
the
following checklist.  Have you: <P>
<UL><LI>Prepared a cover letter?<p>
--Authors must provide assurances that  the  manuscript is an original work that has not
been previously published and that
the manuscript is not being considered concurrently in whole or substantial part by
another publisher.<p>
--Include the name, address, phone number, fax number, and E-mail address (if
available) of each author.<p>
<LI>Included a title page?<p>

and running head. <p>
<LI>Included an abstract?<p>
--The first page of the manuscript should repeat the title of the manuscript and include

words.  The name(s) of the author(s) should not appear on this or any subsequent page
of text.<p>
<LI>Included a disk?<p>
--Label the disk with the computer format (IBM/compatible or Macintosh [high density
only]).<p>
--Indicate the name and version of the program (i.e., WordPerfect 6.1) used to create
the file(s).<p>
--Include on the disk files that contain the manuscript, tables, references, and
figures.<p><LI>Assembled four copies of the complete  manuscript?<P>
--Be sure to retain a copy of the manuscript for your files.<p>If all of these items check
out, mail the materials to:  Dave L. Edyburn, Editor, <I>TEACHING Exceptional
Children,</I>
Department of Exceptional Education, 667 Enderis Hall, University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee, 2400 E. Hartford Ave.,
Milwaukee, WI  53201-0413.</UL><p><B>What happens to a manuscript once it
is
received
in the <I>TEC</I>
offices?</b><P>
When a manuscript is delivered to the <I>TEC</I> offices, the editor reviews the
manuscript and decides whether or not
to accept the manuscript for peer review.  Some of the reasons a manuscript may
not be accepted for review involve
(a) the focus of the manuscript is outside the focus of the journal; (b) failure to follow
the
manuscript guidelines concerning
length, format, and style; or (c) articles on this topic were published within the past 2
years or are slated for publication in
the near future.  Manuscripts that are not accepted for peer review will be promptly
returned so that the author can
seek other avenues for publication.<P>
Each manuscript accepted for peer review is assigned a unique identification number
that is used for tracking the
manuscript through the review and publication process.  The receipt of each manuscript
accepted for peer review is
acknowledged in a letter with the manuscript ID number and detailed information about
the expected timelines for the peer
review.  Authors are encouraged to contact the editorial offices any time during the
review process regarding questions about
the status of their manuscript. <p><B>What should I know about the peer review
process used by <I>TEACHING
Exceptional Children?</I></B><P>
Manuscripts submitted to <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> go through a
blind
review process (that is, the author's
identity is unknown to the reader) for selection.  Typically, four reviewers, with
expertise
in the areas addressed by the
manuscript,   will evaluate the manuscript on the basis of (a) the importance of the
topic, (b) originality, (c) clarity, (d)
accuracy and validity of the content, (e) value of the contribution to the professional
literature, (f) implications for special
education, and (g) quality of the writing.  Each reviewer  will  make a recommendation
for or against publication.  Typically,
this process takes 4-6 weeks.<P>
<B>What happens after a manuscript is reviewed by the peer reviewers?</b><P>
The recommendations of the reviewers are forwarded to the editor.  After reviewing
these recommendations, the editor will
make a decision concerning the manuscript:  (a) decline the opportunity to publish, (b)
request a revision with a stipulation
for further peer review, (c) request a revision subject to additional review by 
<I>TEC</I> staff, or (d) accept as is. <P>
The editorial decision and rationale will be communicated in a letter to the first author. 
Copies of the peer reviews will
be included as well. <p>
Like most journals, almost all manuscripts submitted to <I>TEC</I> involve some
level
of additional revision (b or
c) prior to publication.<p>
<I>Grievance Procedure: </I>Authors who believe that their manuscript was not
reviewed
in a careful or timely manner
and in accordance with The Council for Exceptional Children's procedures should bring
the matter to the attention of the <a href="mailto:fredw@cec.sped.org">
Senior Director of Publications</A>.<p><B>What happens if
a
manuscript is tentatively accepted for publication?</b><P>
If a manuscript receives a favorable review from reviewers and the editor concurs with
the decision, a tentative
recommendation for publication is made.  This recommendation is conditional upon
specific revisions that must be made
as well as the submission of supporting materials (described below).  The information in
this section describes the process
and timelines related to revisions, technical editing, production, and publication.
<p><B><I>Revisions</b></I><P>
Final decision to publish a manuscript is made after the satisfactory completion of
revisions as outlined in the
correspondence.<P>
When a manuscript is accepted for publication, author(s) will be requested to provide a
final-version electronic copy of
their manuscript, tables, references, and all figures (camera-ready copies of tables and
figures may be requested prior to
publication).<p><B><I>Technical Editing</B></I><P>
The editorial staff of <I>TEC</I> reserves the right to make editorial changes that do
not materially affect the meaning
of the text.<P>
<B><I>Production</B></I><P>
To protect the works of authors and The Council for Exceptional Children, CEC
copyrights all of its publications.  Once a
manuscript is scheduled for publication, the authors are notified in writing and sent a
Copyright Release Agreement Form
assigning literary rights to CEC.  Rights and permissions regarding the use of
CEC-copyrighted materials are handled by the
CEC Publications Unit. <P>
Authors who wish to use material, such as figures or tables, for which they do not own
the copyright must obtain written
permission from the copyright holder (usually the publisher) and submit it to CEC with
their manuscripts.  Signed releases
must also be submitted from all individuals appearing in photos submitted for
publication.<p><I>TEC</I> publishes photographs/slides with many of its articles.
To
obtain photo guidelines and release forms contact the
<a
href="mailto:cathym@cec.sped.org">Manager of Periodicals Production</a>.<P>
Accepted manuscripts are copyedited and manuscripts are typeset into page proofs. 
Authors are asked to read proofs
for errors in typesetting and other defects. 
<p><B><I>Publication</B></I><P>
Upon publication of a manuscript in <I>TEC</I>, the author(s) receive five copies of
the
journal.  In the case of multiple
authors, the first author receives 10 copies to distribute among the authors.<P>
