<H3>Adding What Is Known </H3>
<HR>

<P>
To reiterate a critical point made earlier: the MSS dataset was
the primary source for detecting landcover disturbance. However,
ancillary datasets were equally important in the interpretation,
quantification, and enhancement of that disturbance assessment.
In this section, these ancillary datasets are listed and discussed
in order of importance.
<H4>Tenure </H4>

<P>
Tenure is a key factor in any assessment of landuse and landcover
because tenure is a licence that prescribes or proscribes various
landuses, and thus various types of landcover disturbance. Moreover,
the tenure type is a strong guide to future landuse and landcover
change. For example, there is far more certainty about the future
landuse activities on land held under public tenure than that
for private tenure. Thus, tenure can indicate actual and potential
landuse as well as its consequences for landcover disturbance.
<HR>

<P>

<HR>

<P>
The basic dataset used was that compiled by AUSLIG (1994). This
digital dataset contains an initial 16 categories that were aggregated
into a smaller set of 6 to indicate the probability of future
landcover disturbance by grouping by differing levels of tenure
protection.
<P>
The protection is principally against the threat of clearing but
also includes grazing. We created classes of tenure protection
that range from 0 with freehold tenure to 5 with existing dedicated
conservation reserve tenure; Table 4 and the Tenure image. This
assigned rank was used to rate and score the tenure protection
for each landcover type.<HR>

<I>The size and distribution of the six tenures that reflect protection
against future landcover disturbance. The protection rankings
and colour codes are: 0, red; 1, brown; 2, purple; 3, light blue;
4, blue; 5, green.</I><HR>

<H4>Feral Animals </H4>

<P>
After landuse-driven landcover disturbance, the next most significant
contributor to the process of biotic erosion is habitat invasion
by feral (exotic) animals; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Newsome (1994), Short and Smith (1994), Short and Turner (1994)</A>.
<P>
By comparison, the significance of habitat invasion by feral plants
is much less well understood or documented on a continental scale;
eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Humphries et al (1994)</A>. Thus, exotic
plants were not included in this project.
<P>
It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the impact
of feral animals on the flora and fauna of this continent. Much
has been made of the relentless influence two predators, the feral
cat and fox, on the small-sized fauna, particularly in the ELZ.
However, the rabbit cannot be ignored in the overall assessment
of the driving forces of animal extinction. Its arrival and establishment
in the more arid parts of the ELZ led to the destruction of entire
landscapes as captured in this image of the Strzelecki Track in
South Australia.<HR>

<HR>

<P>
Continental datasets of density distribution for a range of pest
mammals have been compiled; <A HREF="refs.htm">Wilson et al (1992)</A>.
From this larger set, four were selected as being the most influential
in the process of biotic impoverishment on continental scales;
the rabbit, cat, fox and pig. Other feral species (camel, goat,
horse) are not as widespread or as influential as the chosen species.
<P>
The feral density datasets are of relative rather than absolute,
and overall their quality is relatively poor. Nevertheless, they
are unique and were used to assess the spatial patterns of intensity
of each feral species' current threat to biodiversity. <HR>

used in the project. Clockwise from the top left the distributions

<H4>Fire Season And Frequency </H4>

<P>
The best available datasets of fire season and fire frequency
for the continent known to the authors were digitised and used
to assess the current level of landuse disturbance from this facet
of landuse. <HR>

<P>
<A NAME="fig2_12"></A><A HREF="reptill/fireseas.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/fireseas.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The continental distribution of fire season. The categories
and codes are: Winter-Spring (purple), Spring (blue); Spring-Summer
(light blue); Summer (brown); Summer-Autumn (red). This dataset
was derived from that published by Luke and <A HREF="refs.htm">McArthur (1978</A>).</I>
<HR>

<P>
<A NAME="fig2_13"></A><A HREF="reptill/firefre1.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/firefre1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The continental distribution of fire frequency aggregated into
just three classes: 1-3 years (red); 5-10 years (blue); &gt; 10
years (brown). This dataset was derived from that published by
<A HREF="refs.htm">Walker (1981)</A></I><HR>

<P>
These two datasets were used to express their influence on the
process of biotic erosion. In doing so we question the conventional
wisdom: not that fire has always been a part of the environment
of all biota on this continent, but whether the fire regimes which
we see today differ significantly from pre-European times. While
wildfires occur from lightning ignition, particularly in the hummock
grasslands of Central and Western Australia, and are constrained
by climatically controlled fuel production and curing, we assert
that the predominant source of ignition is increasingly from landuse;
that is deliberate ignition.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_025.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_025.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The ancillary datasets discussed above were used at 0.01 x 0.01&#176;
(approximately 1 x 1 km) resolution; a much finer scale than at
which any of them were compiled. This is not as serious a problem
as is the veracity of the data itself. Nevertheless, these data
represent the best continentally consistent sets available and
they were used to derive the best continentally consistent assessments
of landcover disturbance possible now. <HR>
