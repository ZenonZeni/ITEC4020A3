In Olivetti's first investment in multimedia development outside
Europe, the company is locating its Regional Multimedia 
Development Centre in Melbourne.

of 
the Asia-Pacific region are major reasons for Olivetti's decision.

in 
establishing the Centre, which has a mandate to develop multimedia
applications for the Asia-Pacific region.

<P>
The Centre will have responsibility for all of Olivetti's Asia-Pacific
subsidiaries involved in the export, support, training, 
communications, demonstration and applications out-sourcing of
multimedia development.
