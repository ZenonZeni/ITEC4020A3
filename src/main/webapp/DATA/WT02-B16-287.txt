<p><strong>Collaboration between Government, Industry, and Universities</strong>
<P>
To achieve the program's goals, we depend heavily on the expertise and contributions of the
program's partners in the national laboratories, universities, and PV industry. 
<P>
The <a href="rescen.html">national laboratories</a> provide long-term, high-risk, but high-payoff
research and development (R&D). The laboratories'  cutting-edge R&D breakthroughs continue
to advance the performance and reliability of PV technologies. Our technology transfer activities
ensure that information reaches the private sector and provides opportunities for industry to
collaborate with laboratory researchers. In collaborative projects, research engineers have
developed more-efficient fabrication and manufacturing processes, better encapsulants and
module packaging, automated manufacturing systems, and refined balance-of-systems
components. They have also helped to establish uniform standards and test methods, rigorous
procedures for qualification testing of PV systems, and data bases of environmental, resource,
and market information.
<P>
Through subcontracts, universities that participate in the National Photovoltaics Program play a
key supporting role in almost every phase of technology development. Their expertise in
fundamental science and materials and device research adds immeasurably to the foundations of
science, the advancement of the technology, and the effectiveness of the program.

<P>
Through collaborative interactions, <a href="mantech.html">industry</a> provides feedback to researchers and engineers on products and processes. Industry gives the program guidance at all points along the development path. As an integral member of our R&D, industry often assumes the lead role
in the engineering and product development phases as a technology develops. Therefore, in
1996, industry nearly 80% of program funding in Technology Development and
nearly 60% of the funding in Systems Engineering and Applications. After all, in the end, it is
industry that brings the effort of the program to fruition in the form of lower-cost PV products.
