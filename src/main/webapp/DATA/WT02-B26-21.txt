<H2>NAMI Analysis of President Clinton's FY 1998 Budget Proposal</H2>
<H4>February 7, 1997</H4>
</font>
<hr>

On February 6, President Clinton introduced his $1.7 trillion budget proposal for FY 
1998.  As is being widely reported in the press, the plan is designed to eliminate the 
federal budget deficit by 2002, offer targeted tax cuts and a reduction of $100 billion from 
the future growth of Medicare.  The President's budget contains a range of policy 
proposals of importance to people with serious brain disorders.  It also includes a range of 
proposed budget cuts and increases in critical programs of concern to NAMI.  Included 
below is a program-by-program analysis of the budget plan.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
NIMH </font><hr>
<P>
For FY 1998, The Administration is proposing an overall NIH budget of $13.1 billion, an 
increase of $337 million (2.6 percent) over this year.  $271 million of this increase is 
directed toward research project grants ($1.5 billion of which is earmarked for AIDS 
research), with $90 million directed toward the second phase of construction of the new 
Clinical Research Center.  The Administration is proposing $630 million for NIMH, a $26 
million increase over FY 1997 (a 4% increase).  This about average for the increases 
proposed for NIH's 13 institutes.  The Administration is requesting a 9% increase for 
NIDA, but only 3% increases for the Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Heart, 
Lung and Blood and Cancer Institutes.  However, these proposed increases are far below 
the increases that key congressional leaders such as Rep. John Edward Porter (R-IL) and 
Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) have pledged to push for.  Senator Specter intends to 
increase NIH by 7.5% in FY 1998 and Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) has introduced a 
resolution to double NIH's budget over the next 5 years.  The Administration's budget 
does not contain any substantive proposals relating to NIH's mission or its pending 
authorization bill.
   <P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
Medicaid </font><hr>
<P>
The President's budget contains a proposal to trim future Medicaid spending by $22 
billion through imposition of a "per capita cap" on federal spending and reform of the 
Disproportionate Share (DSH) program.  These savings are partially offset by changes to 
the current welfare reform initiative (including protecting eligibility for children and legal 
immigrants) which cost $13 billion.  This results in a net savings of $9 billion between 
1998 and 2002.  Overall, the federal share of Medicaid is projected to be $104 billion in 
FY 1998.  This follows the current trend of slowing in program growth over the past few 
years - down to a 3.5% growth rate in 1996, from double digit growth in the late 80's and 
early 90's.  This recent slow down in growth rates has largely accomplished the cuts that 
Congress and the President considered as part of deficit reduction plans considered in 
1995 and 1996.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Per Capita Cap Proposal </font>- The per capita cap plan would place strict state-by-state 
limits on federal Medicaid spending.  Each state's per capita cap would be set on the basis 
of a complicated assessment of current Medicaid spending.  States would be responsible 
for any spending beyond the federally capped contribution.  As such, the proposal's main 
purpose is simply to set an outer limit on federal spending.  In order to help states cope 
with impact of fewer federal dollars going into their Medicaid programs, the budget 
proposes several important programmatic changes.  
<P>
Under the Administration's proposal, states would no longer have to seek federal 
approval, through the Section 1115 waiver process, in order to require beneficiaries to 
enroll in managed care plans.  Repeal of the Section 1115 waiver process would eliminate 
what little federal oversight that has been exercised over the Medicaid managed care 
"behavioral health carve outs" that people with serious brain disorders are joining in 
increasing numbers.  This process would accelerate in increasing numbers if states were 
allowed to compel participation as the Administration is requesting.  President Clinton is 
also seeking repeal of the Boren Amendment - the provision in current law that requires 
Medicaid to pay providers at comparable rates to the private market.  
<P>
The prospects for the per capita cap plan in Congress are dim.  On a bipartisan basis, the 
nation's governors have expressed strong opposition to the proposal.  Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) has also made clear his misgivings.  In addition, regional 
disparities in health care spending are likely to crease huge difficulties for Congress in 
trying to determine the basis for each state's cap level, thereby making interstate disputes 
over funding nearly impossible to resolve.   
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Medicaid Expansions </font>- As noted above, the per capita cap and DSH reforms would save 
the federal government $22 billion over 6 years.  This is offset by $13 billion in increased 
Medicaid spending in several important areas.  First, the Administration is proposing to 
protect Medicaid eligibility for legal immigrants and children who are set to lose eligibility 
for SSI benefits under the welfare reform law signed into law last summer (P.L. 104-193).  
The cost for protecting SSI Children losing cash benefits is projected to be $300 million 
over 6 years.  A relatively small total since 85,000 of the 135,000 children likely to be cut 
off would retain Medicaid eligibility on the basis of their family's low-income status.  A 
more detailed analysis of the just released Childrens' SSI changes is available on the 
NAMI Net.  Continuing eligibility for legal aliens is more costly since the welfare law gave 
states tremendous leeway on whether to grant eligibility for persons entering the U.S. after 
enactment of the welfare bill.  
<P>
Of critical importance to NAMI is a proposal to allow states to establish an income related 
premium "buy-in" for people with disabilities who leave the SSI rolls for employment.  It 
would allow SSI beneficiaries who earn more than certain (yet to be specified) amounts to 
purchase Medicaid coverage by paying a premium that states would set on an income 
related scale.  This proposal is part of a Social Security "return to work" plan which is 
referenced below.  The other major Medicaid expansion relates to the President's 
Childrens' Health Care initiative detailed below.     
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
Childrens' Health </font><hr>
<P>
Both the Administration and Congress are interested in expanding access to health 
coverage for low-income children of working families.  It is estimated that 80% of the 10 
million uninsured children have at least 1 parent in the workforce.  These workers either 
do not have employer provided coverage or are offered "individual only" policies in the 
workplace.  There are 3 parts to the Administration's "Kiddie Care" plan:  a) children of 
workers between jobs (coverage financed by annual state grants to cover premium costs 
for up to 6 months), b) children whose parents earn too much for Medicaid, but too little 
to afford private health insurance (coverage financed through discretionary grants to the 
states for innovative programs), and c) children eligible for Medicaid, but not currently 
enrolled (1-year of extended coverage for children only in cases where parents are at risk 
of losing coverage because of higher earnings or other change in circumstances).  This 
latter category also includes the so-called "Waxman Kids", i.e. children ages 13-18 who 
were to be phased in over the next 5 years.
<P>
Neither the Clinton proposal for expanding coverage for uninsured children, or the current 
congressional alternatives, specify the scope of benefits that private health plans would be 
required to make available to eligible children.  Thus, there is currently no requirement in 
the proposal for mental illness parity for children with brain disorders.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
HUD </font><hr>
<P>
The Clinton Administration is proposing $24.753 billion for the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development for FY 1998.  This is a $5.5 billion increase over current year 
levels, with most of the increase going to renewal of expiring Section 8 rental contracts, 
expansion of tenant-based rental assistance for welfare recipients who are required to 
work and replacement of the most troubled public housing projects.  It is highly unlikely 
that Congress would support efforts to increase HUD's budget in FY 1998.  In fact, HUD 
programs are likely to be squeezed further this year as Congress struggles to find the funds 
necessary to deal with Section 8 renewals and expiring 30-year rental contracts and 
federally insured mortgages, all while avoiding cuts to politically popular programs such as 
CDBG and HOME.    
<P>
For housing programs serving people with brain disorders, the Administration is proposing 
substantial cuts.  The Section 811 program is slated for a $20 million cut, down from its 
current total of $194 million to $174 million.  This continues the current downward trend 
in funding for Section 811, which was funded at $233 million just two years ago.  
Likewise, the Section 202 program (which serves the elderly) is slated for an even larger 
cut of $345 million - a cut of more than 50%.  
<P>
The Administration is proposing no funding for tenant-based rental assistance for non-
elderly people with disabilities (including individuals with serious brain disorders).  For the 
current year, Congress appropriated $50 million for "non-elderly disabled" who are 
adversely impacted by designation of public and assisted housing as "elderly only."  This 
means that for the first time in several years, HUD is not proposing any new resources to 
deal with the emerging housing crisis facing non-elderly people with disabilities as they are 
deemed ineligible for a growing share of public and assisted housing.  The one bright spot 
in the budget proposal is a $9 million increase for fair housing enforcement (up to $39 
million).        
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
Social Security </font><hr>
<P>
For the coming year, Social Security will be largest (and fastest growing) federal program, 
up to $414 billion in FY 1998.  This includes $25.4 billion for the SSI program (for more 
than 5 million eligible recipients) and $36 billion for SSDI benefits (for 4.5 million eligible 
recipients).  The budget also includes more than $70 million in payments to state VR 
agencies for rehabilitation services for beneficiaries (covering services for only 6,000 
people).  The President's budget includes a "Ticket To Independence" proposal designed 
to promote work among beneficiaries and help move people off the disability rolls.  
Currently, less than 1% of beneficiaries leave the rolls.  This despite the fact that many 
beneficiaries, including people with serious brain disorders, want to work.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">"Ticket To Independence" Plan </font>- Specifically, the "Ticket To Independence" proposal 
includes a pilot in 5 to 10 states.  It would allow people with disabilities to use their 
"ticket" with any participating public or private employment or rehabilitation provider of 
their choice (thus eroding the current state VR monopoly).  Providers would be paid only 
when clients are placed in jobs and are removed from the disability rolls.  A new 
demonstration program would allow eligible SSDI beneficiaries to extend Medicare 
coverage beyond the current trial work period once earnings surpass substantial gainful 
activity (SGA).  States would be allowed to extend Medicaid coverage for SSI 
beneficiaries beyond current limits that wipe out eligibility once SGA is achieved.
<P>
While the Clinton Administration's proposal has not been fully fleshed out, there are 
several important qualifications.  SSA cannot move forward without congressional 
authorization.  Also, for SSI beneficiaries, there is nothing that would allow the federal 
government to compel states to extend Medicaid coverage for beneficiaries whose 
earnings are above SGA. 
<P>
From NAMI's perspective, the proposal appears to fall short of the recommendations in 
the recently released report on the state VR system.  First, it does not include protections 
that would allow people with brain disorders to maintain an "open file" that would protect 
eligibility after achieving SGA and losing cash benefits (such an approach would respond 
to the episodic nature of severe mental illness by allowing people to have cash benefits 
quickly restored).  Second, by paying providers only for clients who reach the current 
definition of SGA, the Administration's plan discourages providers from serving people 
with the most severe illnesses and conditions.  Finally, nothing in the proposal requires 
providers to offer long-term supports and services for clients after they have been 
successfully placed in jobs.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">SSI Benefits for Legal Immigrants</font> - The Clinton budget proposes to restore SSI 
eligibility for legal immigrants and refugees who were to be cut off later this year under 
the welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193).  Provisions in the welfare law were designed to 
deny SSI benefits to 500,000 legal aliens, producing a savings of $2.2 billion in FY 1998.  
It is interesting to note that unlike recent changes to the SSI program aimed at persons 
with substance abuse disorders and children, the legal immigrant changes apply regardless 
of the severity of the individual's illness or impairment.  
<P>
Specifically, the proposal would a) protect all immigrants who become disabled after entry 
into the U.S. and b) repeal a requirement in the law for "deeming" of sponsors' income in 
determining SSI eligibility and c) remove the mandate for sponsors to reimburse the 
government for SSI benefits that immigrants receive.  However, these new exceptions 
would not apply if an immigrant was "disabled" prior to entering the U.S.  The 
Administration's proposal also extends for two years SSI eligibility for certain refugees 
and asylees who are currently in the citizenship application pipeline.  These changes are 
estimated to cost $9.9 billion over the next 6 years.  Because of this high cost and 
resistance on the part of GOP leaders to opening up in the welfare reform law to changes, 
passage of the proposal is considered remote.  Thus, legal immigrants with brain disorders 
and their families should continue moving forward with their naturalization and citizenship 
applications.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is now moving to 
expedite applications.  The INS also recently put in place new regulations designed to 
provide exceptions to the naturalization exam and oath requirements for persons with 
severe mental illness.     
<P>

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">SAMHSA</font> - For FY 1998, the Administration is proposing $2.2 billion for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  This is a $35 
million increase over what Congress appropriated for the current fiscal year.  All of this 
increase is directed toward the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) -- $10 
million for the Substance Abuse Block Grant and $28 million for data collection 
(substance abuse prevention is slated for a $5 million cut).  The Administration is 
proposing to freeze all programs under the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS):  
$275.4 million for the Mental Health Block Grant, $58 million for consolidated mental 
health demonstration grants (known as "Knowledge Development and Application" or 
KDAs), $70 million for the Childrens' Mental Health program, $20 million for PATH and 
$22 for PAIMI.
