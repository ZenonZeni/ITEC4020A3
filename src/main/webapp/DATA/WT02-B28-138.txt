<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Message to Policyowners</STRONG></FONT><P>


Every child is born with the right to dream, and hopefully, they'll go as far as their 
dreams will take them.  But, wherever they go and whatever they dream, New York Life will be 
there -- just as it has been for the last seven generations.
<P>

	When we began in 1845, we were a small company located in New York City doing business in
the
eastern part of the United States.  Today, 150 years later, we are a $74 billion financial services
organization with interests that span the globe.  We have locations in thousands of towns and cities
across the country and throughout the world.  
<P>

	As a world leader in the financial services field, we touch the lives of millions of Americans -- and
others around the world -- through diversified investments and a wide range of services.  Our clients include 
such large organizations as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Minor League Baseball Insurance Trust
for players and umpires, as well as you, your family, your neighbors, and friends.
<P> 
	Our greatest accomplishments during our sesquicentennial were a natural outgrowth of 150 years
of
dedicated, continuous service to our customers.  We set ambitious financial goals -- and exceeded
them, created new products to meet your changing needs, and enhanced our leadership position as
a company that protects policyowners' interests.<P>
	Through our financial products, managed health care, and invested assets, we help shape the
future
for millions of men and women.  Our size and diversity are part of what keeps us financially strong. 
Proof of this statement can be found in our 1995 financial results.  Our sales -- generally annualized
insurance premiums and new money from investment products -- increased 13 percent from 1994; our
consolidated assets reached $74.3 billion; our net gain was $373 million; our surplus and investment
reserves totaled $5.2 billion; and the ratio of surplus to assets, a key measure of strength, was a solid
6.95 percent -- one of the highest among major life insurers.  Remaining strong enables us to help you reach your 
financial goals.  It's a strategy we intend to keep for the next 150 years.  And those years promise to be even more 
dynamic -- and successful -- than the last.
<P>
	Adding new products also helps us to meet your goals.  While industry growth remained sluggish, the introduction
of new products and plans helped our individual insurance and annuity sales climb 24 percent from 1994.  We're
pleased at this tremendous vote of consumer confidence in our agents, brokerage producers, products, and 
quality of service.
<P>
	One new product, our LifeStages<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> variable annuity, contributed to a record-breaking
year for the Individual Annuity line of business -- resulting in nearly $1.4 billion in sales.  Our
revitalized Agency Force alone sold 34 percent more annuity business in 1995 than the year before.  And, our
Five-Year Term policy contributed significantly to our more than $70 million in new term premium -- one of our
best years ever for this traditional product.
<P>
Another important move was the  reorganization of our managed care operations to form NYLCare
Health Plans, Inc.  We merged our Group insurance operations with one of our most  profitable and
fastest-growing subsidiaries, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, an HMO and managed care organization. 
This enhanced the quality of our operations and service, and simplified the way the
organizations and individuals can purchase and manage their health care benefits.  NYLCare, which
estimates its 1996 revenues will reach $2.5 billion, now offers a full spectrum of health care
products and services, including group insurance, preferred provider organizations, and HMO
products.<P>

	In 1995, we also became a major direct marketer of life insurance as the provider for the AARP Life
Insurance Program.  Chosen by the American Association of Retired Persons after a rigorous selection
process, we began offering the program to AARP members in the fall of 1994, and the response was
overwhelming.  In 1995, sales reached $53 million, exceeding our initial estimates by a wide
margin.<P>
	Our MainStay<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Funds set records for sales and surpassed the $6 billion asset mark in 1995.  We can
credit this success to outstanding equity performance, as well as the efforts of both of our distribution
channels -- the New York Life Agency Force and Wall Street brokerage firms.  On the pension side, our
traditional Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) product continued to provide retirement security for
our clients as we maintained our market leadership position.
<P>
	One of our strongest assets is integrity.  It's been a hallmark of our Company for 150 years.  A
prime example of our belief in the integrity of our people, our products, and our promises was the 
settlement in 1995 of a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of certain policyowners.  It involved sales practice
issues and in particular, policyowners' understanding of dividends and interest crediting rates. 
<P>
	The Company's financial strength and our confidence in our agents allowed us to work out an innovative settlement,
approved by the Supreme Court of New York State in January 1996.  It was high in benefits and aid to policyowners 
in the class, while doing nothing to disadvantage our other policyowners.  In fact, over 99 percent of the
policyowners in the class have elected to accept the settlement, attesting to its fairness.
<P>
	Our great financial strength, coupled with our leadership position on issues of integrity 
which affect our policyowners, is reflected on many levels.  A <EM>Fortune</EM> 100 company overall, New York Life 
now ranks fourth in the insurance industry on the basis of assets and revenues, and in life insurance sales.  And, once
again, New York Life and its subsidiary, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), have received
high marks from the major ratings agencies.  For claims-paying ability, both Standard &amp; Poor's and Duff &amp; Phelps
assign us AAA, their highest ratings.  For financial strength, A.M. Best gives us an A++, its second highest classification, 
and Moody's Investors Service gives us Aa1, its second highest 
of 19 possible ratings.
<P>
	Our consistently high ratings are further proof that we keep the needs of our policyowners at the 
forefront of every decision we make.  Our financial strength will enable us to pay out $1.2 billion in dividends
in 1996, the highest amount in New York Life's history.
<P>
	1995 was also a year of change for our Board.  President George Bundschuh took a long-planned early retirement 
on October 1, 1995.  George's New York Life career spanned 36 years, and he was a valued member of both our 
Board and our Company.  He will be missed for his intellect and vision.
<P>
	As chairman, I will especially miss George.  We worked closely on many issues and his advice was always invaluable.  
It was imperative that his replacement also be an  innovative leader who believes in the New York Life commitment 
to provide quality sevice and sound financial management.
<P>
	For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to have Sy Sternberg as my co-signer on this letter, having succeeded George
	as president.  Sy joined 
New York Life in 1989 as head of Group operations.  With his steady leadership and innovative thinking, this 
area became a major player in the health care arena, culminating in the creation of NYLCare.  Now, as president and chief 
operating officer, Sy has all of the business operations of the Company reporting to him.  He is the vice chairman of two
Board committees: Executive  &amp; Insurance and Investment.
<P>
	We also welcomed three new Board members and were heartened by the recent return of a former Director. Our new members
are Robert Baylis, former vice chairman of CS First Boston, Inc., who is a member of the Investment Committee; Kent Foster, the president of GTE Corporation, who is a member of the Executive &amp; Insurance Committee; and 
Leslie McCraw, the chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor Corporation, who also serves on the Investment Committee.
Conrad Harper, a partner at the law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, left the Board three years ago to serve as
a legal adviser to the Department of State and as a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague.  He
rejoined the Board in 1996.  Mr. Harper is a member of the Executive &amp; Insurance Committee.  We should benefit 
greatly from the insight and years of experience each man brings to the Company.
<P>
	We want to take the opportunity of this letter to reaffirm the Company's traditional promises to you: to remain 
strong; to take every opportunity for prudent, managed growth; and above all, to be here for you when you need us.   When
you dream a world -- for yourself or your children -- you may not hear our name or see our buildings, but we are there.<P>
We always will be.
