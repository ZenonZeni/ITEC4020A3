SEOUL HOPES CEAUSESCU'S FALL MAY ENCOURAGE N. KOREA REFORM+

     SEOUL, DEC. 26 KYODO - THE DRAMATIC DOWNFALL OF ROMANIA'S
PRESIDENT NICOLAE CEAUSESCU WILL BRING HEAVY PRESSURE TO NORTH KOREA
TO REORIENT ITS CLOSED SOCIETY TOWARD OPENNESS AND REFORMS, ANALYSTS
HERE SAID TUESDAY.
     IT MUST HAVE COME AS A BIGGER SURPRISE THAN ANY DEVELOPMENT IN
OTHER EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE PYONGYANG HAS MAINTAINED CLOSE
TIES WITH ROMANIA.
     NORTH KOREAN LEADERS ARE, HOWEVER, CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS
ON MORE INTENSIVE INDOCTRINATION OF THE PEOPLE RATHER THAN COMPLYING
WITH A WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE AND ECONOMIC REFORMS SWEEPING THE
EAST BLOC, ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SOUTH
KOREAN GOVERNMENT.
     "THE NORTH NOW SEEMS TO FEEL A SENSE OF ISOLATION FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH THE FALL OF THE STALINIST ROMANIAN
LEADER WITH WHOM NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM IL SUNG HAD SO FAR FELT
AFFINITY," SAID CHOI MOON HYUN, DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR POLICY AT THE
NATIONAL UNIFICATION BOARD.
     NORTH KOREA SENT A CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE TO CEAUSESCU ON THE
OCCASION OF THE 14TH ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS LAST MONTH IN
WHICH IT STRESSED A JOINT STRUGGLE AGAINST CAPITALISM.  EARLY THIS
MONTH, FOREIGN MINISTER KIM YONG NAM VISITED BUCHAREST TO REAFFIRM
SOLIDARITY IN THE FACE OF DRASTIC CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE, CHOI
NOTED.
     "PYONGYANG WILL FIND NO OPTION BUT TO TAKE A POSITIVE POSTURE
IN GLASNOST AND PERESTROIKA IN THE LONG RUN.  THERE ARE SIGNS THAT IT
WOULD EMERGE FROM THE LONG-HELD ISOLATION POLICY DURING THE FIRST
HALF OF NEXT YEAR, IT MAY BE SENSED IN DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTH,"
HE SAID.
     CHOI BYUNG BO, SPOKESMAN FOR THE BOARD, SOUTH KOREA'S TOP
UNIFICATION AUTHORITY, SAID THE NORTH MIGHT EXPERIMENT WITH OPENNESS
IN ITS SLUGGISH ECONOMY AMONG OTHER FIELDS, LIKE CHINA.
     "WE HEAR THAT THE PACE OF OPENNESS WAS ON THE AGENDA FOR THE
MEETING KIM IL SUNG HAD WITH DENG XIAOPING DURING HIS SUDDEN VISIT TO
BEIJING EARLY LAST MONTH," THE SPOKESMAN SAID.
     THE ANALYSTS GENERALLY RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SURGE FROM
BELOW, SAYING THOUGH THE LEADERSHIP IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT GRADUAL
REFORMS FROM ABOVE.
     SHIN YOUNG SUK, DIRECTOR OF THE PRIVATE, PEACE RESEARCH
INSTITUTE, ATTRIBUTED THE COLLAPSE OF CEAUSESCU TO THE ROMANIAN
PEOPLE, AWAKENED BY A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND THE EAST-WEST
THAW IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND A LOT OF "PRO-SOVIET"
GENERALS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO SUPPORT REFORMS.
     "THE CASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF NORTH KOREA.
PYONGYANG'S DEPENDENCY ON MOSCOW IS NOTABLY LOW IN ITS ADROIT
EQUI-DISTANCE DIPLOMACY.  THE MILITARY IS LOYAL TO KIM IL SUNG, AND
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT WELL AWARE OF CURRENT EAST EUROPEAN EVENTS DUE TO
TIGHT CONTROL OF INFORMATION," HE SAID.
     THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA ON SUNDAY BRIEFLY REPORTED ON UPRISINGS
IN "A FEW" ROMANIAN CITIES WITHOUT MENTIONING ABOUT
CEAUSESCU'S ARREST.
     THE RODONG SHINMUN, THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF NORTH KOREA'S
WORKERS' PARTY, CARRIED A LENGTHY EDITORIAL IN ITS FRONT AND SECOND
PAGES FRIDAY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO "DRIVE AWAY IMPERIALIST
CHALLENGES AND MARCH ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM WITH MORE VIGOR,"
THE VERY DAY THE ROMANIAN SITUATION CAPTURED HEADLINES IN MOST PAPERS
AROUND THE WORLD.

INDONESIAN PAPER COMPARES CEAUSESCU TO DRACULA+

     JAKARTA, DEC. 27 KYODO - AN INDONESIAN DAILY NEWSPAPER COMMENTED
ON THE EXECUTION OF ROMANIAN PRESIDENT NICOLAE CEAUSESCU ON
WEDNESDAY, COMPARING HIM TO DRACULA AND SAYING NOBODY WHO IS SANE
WILL MOURN HIS DEATH.
     THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE INDONESIAN OBSERVER SAID, "IT'S KIND OF
HARD TO EXPECT A ROMANIAN CITIZEN, OR ANYBODY SANE FOR THAT MATTER,
TO MOURN THE DEATH BY A FIRING SQUAD OF ROMANIAN LEADER, DICTATOR
NICOLAE CEAUSESCU AND HIS WIFE, ELENA."
     IT ADDED, "SOME PEOPLE, WHILE SAYING 'GOOD RIDDANCE,' MIGHT
HAVE WISHED THE EXECUTION TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE YEARS BEFORE CEAUSESCU
AND HIS SECRET POLICE HAD THE CHANCE TO COMMIT SUCH GENOCIDE AGAINST
ROMANIAN PEOPLE EVEN COUNT DRACULA WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL SICK OF."
     COUNT DRACULA WAS A FICTIONAL VAMPIRE WHO LIVED IN
TRANNSYLVANIA, A REGION IN WESTERN ROMANIA.
     THE EDITORIAL SAID CEAUSESCU HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS
"SATANIC," AND AT ONE POINT IN HISTORY HE EVEN DELIGHTED THE
WEST WITH HIS INDEPENDENT VIEWS AS FAR AS MOSCOW-LED COMMUNISM WAS
CONCERNED.
     "CEAUSESCU WAS AFTER ALL ANOTHER DICTATOR WHO HAS FOUND HIS
DEMISE IN A WAY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A SOMBER PROMISE FOR RULERS
REFUSING TO CLIMB OFF THE TIGER THEY ARE RIDING WHILE THE DISMOUNTING
IS STILL SAFE," THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDED.
     INDONESIAN NEWSPAPERS HEADLINED THE EXECUTION OF CEAUSESCU AND
HIS WIFE IN THEIR WEDNESDAY EDITIONS.

CHINESE ARMY REFUSED TO CRUSH BEIJING DEMOS, PAPER SAYS+

     HONG KONG, DEC. 28 KYODO - OVER 1,500 SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS OF
CHINA'S 38TH GROUP ARMY REFUSED ORDERS OR DESERTED THEIR POSTS
DURING THE MILITARY CRACKDOWN ON BEIJING'S PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT IN
APRIL AND JUNE, HONG KONG'S SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST SAID THURSDAY.
     THE BEIJING-BASED 38TH GROUP ARMY WAS FIRST ORDERED BY SENIOR
CHINESE LEADER DENG XIAOPING, THE THEN CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY'S
CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION (CMC), TO SEVERELY RESTRICT
DEMONSTRATORS' ACTIVITIES IN LATE APRIL THE REPORT SAID.
     BUT THE 38TH GROUP'S ARMY'S COMMANDER AND 110 OTHER OFFICERS
"BREACHED DISCIPLINE IN A SERIOUS MANNER DURING THE STRUGGLE TO
CRUSH THE COUNTER-REVELUTIONARY REBELLION," ACCORDING TO A SENIOR
PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY (PLA) LEADER QUOTED BY THE DAILY.
     THE REVELATION CAME IN AN UNPUBLISHED SPEECH MADE IN BEIJING
EARLIER THIS MONTH BY YANG BAIBING, CHIEF POLITICAL COMMISSAR OF
CHINA'S PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY, THE REPORT SAID.
    YANG BAIBING, YOUNGER BROTHER OF CHINESE PRESIDENT YANG SHANGKUN,
MADE THE SPEECH AT A CONFERENCE TO BOOST THE ARMY'S POLITICAL
PROGRAM.
    IN THE SPEECH -- COPIES OF WHICH ARE SAID TO BE CIRCULATING AMONG
SENIOR ARMY AND PARTY OFFICIALS -- YANG STRESSED THE NEED FOR
INCREASED IDEOLOGICAL WORK TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF DISCIPLINE
PROBLEMS, THE REPORT SAID.
     THE NEWSPAPER QUOTED YANG AS SAYING THAT 1,400 SOLDIERS OF THE
38TH GROUP ARMY "SHED THEIR WEAPONS AND RAN AWAY."

SENIOR OFFICERS WHO DISOBEYED CMC ORDERS.

AUTUMN, THE REPORT SAID.
     YANG'S SPEECH MARKS THE FIRST TIME CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE
ADMITTED THE EXTENT TO WHICH ARMY OFFICERS DISOBEYED TOP-LEVEL ORDERS
TO ENFORCE MARTIAL LAW IN BEIJING AND OTHER PARTS OF CHINA.
     PREVIOUS STATEMENTS HAVE STRESSED ARMY AND PARTY UNITY OVER THE
WAY THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMEMT WAS PUT DOWN, ANALYSTS SAID.
     THE TOPPLING AND EXECUTION OF HARD-LINE ROMANIAN COMMUNIST
LEADER NICOLAE CEAUSESCU, IN WHICH THE ROMANIAN ARMY PLAYED A MAJOR
ROLE, HAS PROMPTED THE CMC TO TIGHTEN ITS CONTROL OVER THE PLA THEY
SAID.
     YANG BAIBING ALSO MADE A STRONG ATTACK ON FORMER CHINESE
COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF ZHAO ZIYANG, THE REPORT SAID.
     ZHAO -- WIDELY SEEN AS THE ARCHITECT OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC REFORM
POLICIES -- WAS STRIPPED OF ALL POSTS FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THE
PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT IN JUNE.
     YANG ACCUSED ZHAO OF HAVING UNDERMINED THE WORK OF THE PLA'S
GENERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.
     ZHAO'S AIM WAS "TO MEET THE POLITICAL NEEDS OF THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE BOURGEOIS LIBERALIZATION," YANG WAS QUOTED AS SAYING.
     "THEIR GOAL IS TO OVERTHROW (THE EXISTING ORDER) AND TO BUILD
UP A NEW ONE," YANG ADDED IN THE STRONGEST CRITICISM YET OF THE
FORMER LIBERAL LEADER.

     BUT MANGLAPUS SET FOUR CONDITIONS, ONE OF THEM BEING THAT A
SIMILAR CENTER BE ESTABLISHED BY HANOI.  OTHER CONDITIONS WERE THAT
REFUGEE NUMBERS WOULD BE LIMITED, THAT THE CENTER WOULD REMAIN
OPERATIONAL FOR ONLY THREE YEARS AND THAT MANILA WOULD NOT BE
FINANCIALLY COMMITED TO THE CENTER'S OPERATIONS.
     PRESIDENT CORAZON AQUINO, HOWEVER, DECIDED TO BE "FLEXIBLE"
AND MADE THE DECISION AFTER THE U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES
ASSURED HER LAST NOVEMBER 29 THAT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE NOW EXISTED TO
SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF THE PLACEMENT OF THOSE REFUGEES WHO REMAIN IN
CAMPS AFTER OTHERS ARE CHOSEN FOR RESETTLEMENT.
     A DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS STATEMENT SAID THE DECISION WAS
ALSO MOTIVATED BY "THE PHILIPPINES' GENUINE COMMITMENT IN
ASSISTING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE SEARCH FOR A DURABLE AND
HUMANITARIAN SOLUTION TO THE REFUGEE PROBLEM AS WELL AS OUR SINCERE
CONCERN AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS."
     ABOUT 17.8 MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT TO EXPAND THE PRESENT
REFUGEE PROCESSING CENTER IN MORONG, BATAAN PROVINCE, 50 KILOMETERS
NORTHWEST OF MANILA, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANOTHER FACILITY IN THE
SAME AREA.
     FUNDS FOR THE CENTER, INCLUDING THE ANNUAL BUDGET OF 5 MILLION
DOLLARS, WILL COME FROM BRITAIN THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND OTHER
RESETTLEMENT COUNTRIES, THE STATEMENT SAID.
     THERE ARE ABOUT 15,000 INDOCHINESE REFUGEES IN THREE PROCESSING
CENTERS IN THE PHILIPPINES WAITING FOR TRANSSHIPMENT TO RESETTLEMENT
COUNTRIES.

PREMIER LI PENG -- DREW HISSES FROM A HAND-PICKED AUDIENCE OF 300

HAD BEEN SUBMITTED IN ADVANCE AND POSED BY APPROVED STUDENT LEADERS
REGARDING CHINA'S RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN ROMANIA.
     BUT YUAN REFUSED TO ANSWER WHEN A STUDENT SHOUTED A QUESTION
ABOUT WHY OUSTED COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF ZHAO ZIYANG HAD BEEN BLAMED
FOR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY SENIOR LEADER DENG
XIAOPING'S POLICIES.

FELT BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP ABOUT THE POSSIBLE
REPERCUSSIONS OF THE FALL OF THE HARD-LINE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN
ROMANIA, ANALYSTS SAID.
     THE DEFIANCE SHOWN BY A HAND-PICKED STUDENT AUDIENCE INDICATES
THE CURRENT LEVEL OF DISTRUST THAT EXISTS BETWEEN STUDENTS AND THE
PARTY, THEY ADDED.
     MEANWHILE, IN FURTHER SIGNS OF DISSENT, LARGE-CHARACTER POSTERS
HAVE APPEARED AT BEIJING AND QINGHUA UNIVERSITIES COMMENTING ON THE
ROMANIAN UPRISING, ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN FRIDAY'S HONG KONG
