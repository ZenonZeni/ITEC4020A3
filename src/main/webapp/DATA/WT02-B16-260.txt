<H2>PV Connected to Utilities</H2>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong>
<P>Utilities are required to buy power from owners of PV systems
(and other independent producers of electricity) under the Public
Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA). An approved,
utility-grade <a href="balance4.html">inverter</a> converts the dc power from PV modules into
ac power that exactly matches the voltage and frequency of the
electricity flowing in the utility line, and also meets the
utility's safety and power-quality requirements. Safety switches
in the inverter automatically disconnect the PV system from the
line if utility power fails. This safety disconnect protects
utility repair personnel from being shocked by electricity
flowing from the PV array into what they would expect to be a
"dead" utility line. 

<P>In addition to cooperating under PURPA, utilities are
establishing rate structures that may make PV grid-connected
systems more economical. (At today's prices, when the cost of
installing a utility-connected PV system is divided by the amount
of electricity it will produce over 30 years, PV-generated
electricity is almost always more expensive than power supplied
by the utility.) For example, some utilities charge higher prices
at certain times of the day. In some parts of the country, the
highest charges for electricity under this time-of-day pricing
structure are now nearly equal to the cost of energy from PV. The
better the match between the electrical output of the PV modules
and the time of highest prices, the more effective the system
will be in reducing utility bills.
