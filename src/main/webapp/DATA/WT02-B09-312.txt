<h2>Diagnostic <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation</a> of the Dog
with Clinical Signs Indicative of Hyperadrenocorticism</h2>
<p>If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected in a patient based on
history, physical examination, and clinical signs, initial
laboratory tests should be performed to aid in differentiation of
other concurrent disease processes. </p>
<p>Once a presumptive diagnosis is made, screening tests should
be performed in order to establish a diagnosis of
hyperadrenocorticism. If, based on screening tests, the diagnosis
is established, additional diagnostic tests are performed in
order to aid in the differentiation of dogs with
pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) from
dogs with functional adrenal tumors. </p>
<p>Note: Patients with a history of recent or repetitive
exogenous corticosteroid administration and clinical signs and
laboratory abnormalities consistent with hyperadrenocorticism
should be tapered from corticosteroids for a period of two weeks,
and then remain off of corticosteroids for a period of six weeks
prior to performing screening tests. The ACTH stimulation test
can be used to differentiate iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism from
the naturally occurring disease. Treatment for dogs diagnosed as
having iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism involves tapering and
discontinuation of medications containing corticosteroids. </p>

mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets are almost white, flat tablets
containing 2, 5 10, 15 or 30 mg of the 1-isomer of selegiline HC1
(1-deprenyl HC1). The inactive ingredients are Lactose, Starch,
Povidone, Magnesium Stearate, and Talc. </p>
<p><strong>ACTION: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; has been shown to be effective treatment
for pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs as
demonstrated by amelioration of clinical signs and improved
regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. In
each of three clinical trials there was a progressive improvement
in endocrine function, as documented by results of low dose
dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) tests (1,2). Significant
clinical improvement was also demonstrated (1,2). Typical
clinical signs of PDH include polydipsia, polyuria, increased
frequency of urination and loss of housetraining, panting,
reduced activity, changes in sleep patterns, altered appetite,
obesity, alopecia, abdominal distention, reduced skin elasticity,
thin skin, and poor hair growth (1-3). In clinical trials, dogs
with PDH treated with ANIPRYL&#174; exhibited decreased body
weight and improved body conformation determined by measurement,
as well as amelioration of dermatologic signs (skin thickness and
elasticity, alopecia, pyoderma), and regrowth of hair (1,2).
Quality of life/general health was significantly improved based
on increased behavioral and cognitive responses such as higher
activity level, increased interaction with and responsiveness to
the owner, decreased polydipsia and panting, improved
housetraining habits and sleep patterns (1,2). </p>
<p>The LDDS test is used to confirm dysregulation of the HPA
axis, and to monitor endocrinologic response to therapy with
ANIPRYL&#174; (1,2,4). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
secretion from the pars intermedia of the canine pituitary gland,
and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) mediated ACTH release
from the pars distalis are tonically inhibited by central nervous
system dopamine levels (5-7). Loss of this tonic inhibition
results in increased secretion of ACTH, which results in adrenal
hyperplasia and increased production of cortisol (7).
Hypothalamic dopamine concentrations are decreased in dogs with
PDH (8). Selegiline helps restore depleted central dopamine
levels and facilitates dopaminergic transmission by several
mechanisms, especially potent selective, irreversible inhibition
of MAOB (1,9). Selegiline also increases the synthesis and
release of dopamine into the synapse, and inhibits dopamine
reuptake (9). Selegiline or its metabolites may enhance release
of other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (9). </p>
<p>In the clinical trials noted above, dogs treated with
ANIPRYL&#174; exhibited progressive improvement in neuroendocrine
function, as demonstrated by improvement (normalization in some
patients) of LDDS test results (1,2). The precise mechanism for
this continued improvement is unknown, but may involve
neuroprotection or nerve rescue, in addition to the mechanisms
noted above. Experiments in laboratory animals demonstrated that
selegiline enhanced the survival of neurons after nerve trauma or
exposure to neurotoxins (10,11). </p>
<p>Canine PDH is a neuroendocrine disease which shares numerous
features in common with several neurodegenerative disorders
(2,12). For example, behavioral signs and cognitive impairment in
subjects with HPA axis dysregulation may resemble some of the
behavioral and cognitive impairments in people with Parkinson's
or Alzheimer' s disease (12,13). Clinical trials in people with
these disorders have demonstrated that selegiline improves
cognitive and other CNS functions (14,15). Studies in laboratory
and pet dogs have also revealed age associated cognitive
dysfunction which is responsive to selegiline therapy (13,16,17). </p>
<p>Some neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's
disease, may represent abnormally rapid brain aging (18).
Parkinsonian patients treated with selegiline lived longer than
those not receiving the drug (19). Furthermore, laboratory
animals treated with selegiline exhibited significantly longer
life compared to placebo treated animals (20). </p>
<p><strong>TOXICITY: <br>
</strong>Selegiline hydrochloride was administered orally to
beagle dogs once daily for one year at doses of 0, 1, 4 or 16
mg/kg. The no effect level was found to be 1 mg/kg. The following
clinical signs were noted in some dogs at higher doses:
salivation, panting, repetitive movements, decreased weight gain
and changes in activity level. </p>
<p><strong>INDICATIONS: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; tablets are indicated for the treatment of
uncomplicated canine pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism.
They are not indicated for treatment of other forms of Cushing's
syndrome. </p>
<p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: <br>
</strong>Endocrine function testing to confirm pituitary
dependent hyperadrenocorticism should be performed by a licensed
veterinarian prior to initiation of therapy. If complications of
PDH are evident at the time of diagnosis or emerge during
ANIPRYL&#174; therapy the patient should be evaluated and, if
warranted, alternative therapy considered. Concurrent use of
ANIPRYL&#174; in conjunction with other therapy of canine PDH has
not been reported. ANIPRYL&#174; should not be administered at
doses exceeding those recommended. </p>
<p><strong>REPRODUCTION: <br>
</strong>The effect of ANIPRYL&#174; on reproduction in the bitch
has not been determined. </p>
<p><strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; is contraindicated in patients with known
hypersensitivity to this drug. Controlled studies to determine
the interaction of selegiline when administered with other drugs
have not been conducted in dogs. To date, patients enrolled in
clinical trials have not been reported to exhibit adverse drug
interactions with heartworm prophylaxis, a variety of
antimicrobials, anthelmenthics and analgesics. Concurrent use of
selegiline with other MAO inhibitors, such as Amitraz, is not
recommended. In humans, selegiline is contraindicated for use
with meperidine and this contraindication is often extended to
other opioids. Further experience in humans has revealed adverse
interactions between nonspecific MAO inhibitors and tricyclic
antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Although to date no such
interaction has been reported for selegiline in any nonhuman
species, it seems prudent to avoid such combinations in dogs. </p>
<p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS: <br>
</strong>During clinical trials eighty seven dogs treated with
ANIPRYL&#174; for as long as 2 years were monitored for the
occurrence of adverse events. No serious adverse events thought
to be related to ANIPRYL&#174; therapy were reported and no
adverse drug interactions were reported. </p>
<p><strong>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: <br>
</strong>After confirmation of the diagnosis of PDH,
ANIPRYL&#174; is recommended orally once daily at an initial dose
of 1 mg/kg (0.45 mg/lb) body weight. During the first two months
of therapy, the patient should be re-evaluated periodically for
clinical response by history and physical examination. If no
improvement in clinical signs or physical examination findings is
evident by 2 months the dose can be increased to a maximum of 2
mg/kg once daily, and the dog re-evaluated in similar fashion one
month later. If there is still no improvement or if at any time
clinical signs progress, the patient should be evaluated for the
presence of concurrent disorders, including performance of
appropriate laboratory tests or other studies as warranted. In
dogs whose clinical signs of PDH progress despite ANIPRYL&#174;
therapy in the absence of concurrent disease, alternative therapy
should be considered. </p>
<p><strong>AVAILABILITY: <br>
</strong>Five tablet sizes are available in blister packages of
30's: 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. </p>
