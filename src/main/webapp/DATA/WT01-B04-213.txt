<P>      GTS Duratek provides waste treatment solutions for radioactive, hazardous, mixed, and other wastes.  From a foundation of intellectual property, proprietary technology, and strategic alliances with world-class partners, the Company develops and implements low-cost technologies to convert waste to environmentally safe forms, maximize volume reduction, and eliminate secondary waste streams.  GTS Duratek achieves this through the integration of synergistic waste treatment technologies -- vitrification, thermal desorption, and ion exchange -- combined with technical support services.  The Company's management team has extensive expertise in project management in a wide array of technical disciplines.  GTS Duratek supplements this core of expertise with more than 20,000 highly qualified and motivated personnel selected from its proprietary rapid-search data base.
<BR>
<P>     GTS Duratek has a solid track record for completing projects on time and under budget.  As a sole contractor or a strong teammate to large architect/engineering (AE) and environmental firms, the company is a proven performer in providing skilled individuals, project teams, and integrated services and technology packages tailored to each client's specific needs.

<U><B>GTS Duratek's Research Arm:</B></U> 
<P>The Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL)
<P>GTS Duratek holds an exclusive agreement with the world-class materials research facility that has made glass from over 50 DOE wastes.  According to scientists the world over, glass is the most durable waste form known to man.  The harmful contaminants of waste molecularly bond with the glass, so there is no longer an environmental pollution threat.

<P>
<U><B>Vitrification Technology Is Unique</B></U>
<P>GTS Duratek/VSL minimum additive approach achieves maximum waste volume reduction thereby reducing storage capacity or landfill costs, which often offsets higher treatment costs.  For example, on the Savannah River M-Area project, GTS Duratek estimates that its technology will be 40% cheaper in total waste life cycle costs than conventional stabilization methods, which actually increase waste volume.
