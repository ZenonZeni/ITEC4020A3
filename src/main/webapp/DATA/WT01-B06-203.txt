</H1><P>



<P><B>Stop the Presses!  Stop the Presses!  The International Trade Commission



has ruled that Mitsubishi violated U.S. trade laws by selling eight massive



newspaper printing presses to the Washington Post at millions of dollars

below cost.  This process is known as dumping, and dumping is intended to

drive competitors out of business.  The target of Mitsubishi's dumping campaign,



Rockwell, is an American company based in Illinois, which manufactures



competitive printing equipment in the United States.  The Washington Post



acknowledges the high quality of the Rockwell presses, but still chose the



Mitsubishi equipment primarily because of its impossibly-low price.</B>



<P><B>It is important to note that the International Trade Commission is

no agency of protectionism.   In fact, the ITC often bends over backwards

to make sure the rights of foreign producers are protected and recently ruled



that Mexican tomatoes were not being dumped into the United States.    Thus,

when the ITC finds that a company dumped products in the United States, we

should take notice.</B>



<P><B>Now is the time to reconsider the decision to buy Mitsubishi printing



presses.  The International Trade Commission's unanimous decision that Mitsubishi



is dumping these presses demonstrates that the sale was neither fairly nor



legally negotiated.  If the Washington Post cares at all about America's

future, it should immediately cancel its contract with Mitsubishi to buy

$250 million worth of  printing equipment.   Since a contract in violation

of U.S. law is legally cancelable, the Washington Post should take the proper



action and not aid and abet companies that willfully violate U.S. laws.</B>



<P><B>Mitsubishi's tactics follow a precedent that Japanese companies set

in the 1970s when they dumped televisions in the United States, driving all



American television manufacturers out of business.  Zenith, the last



American-owned company to manufacture television in the United States, stood



alone against the Japanese onslaught, but was eventually driven out of the



market.  We have to stop these illegal practices before they destroy another



American industry.</B>



<P><B>For Japan international trade is war.  For the United States trade



negotiation is a game that its lawyers play- if they play nicely, they may

be hired to represent the Japanese after they retire from the government.

 Far too many U.S. trade negotiators have become traitors, negotiating on

behalf of foreign clients soon after leaving their U.S. government jobs.</B>



<P><B>Mitsubishi has a long history of corporate piracy and military



interventionism.   A recent example of Mitsubishi's corporate piracy involves



Fusion Systems, a small American high-tech company.  According to the Harvard



Business Review, Fusion invented a high-intensity ultraviolet lamp that is



powered by microwaves.  Fusion's microwave lamps are state-of-the art and

are used in the printing process and in the production of microchips.  Fusion



began selling its products in Japan in 1975.  Mitsubishi bought one in 1977

and had it delivered directly to its research and development lab where



Mitsubishi claimed it as its own in multiple patent filings in Japan.  This



process is called theft.</B>



<P><B>Mitsubishi has a favored place in the history of Japan's military



operations.  When the Japanese emperor launched a military conquest of Taiwan

in 1874, Mitsubishi was chosen to provide the ships. After Japan invaded

China in 1937, Mitsubishi was required to provide the military and occupation



forces with warships, aircraft, vehicles, weapons and provisions.  During

World War II Mitsubishi Heavy Industries manufactured 18,000 warplanes, including



the feared "Zero," which was often used in kamikaze or suicide attacks when

the pilot crashed his plane into American warships.</B>



<P><B>After World War II General Douglas MacArthur ordered that the Mitsubishi



keiretsu (cartel) be broken up.  Now, more than forty companies carry the



Mitsubishi name and three-diamond logo and are superficially separate.  The



Mitsubishi keiretsu, which includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (manufacturers

of the disputed printing presses) and Mitsubishi Motors, has been re-established



and is now the largest corporate empire in the world.</B>



<P><B>Like suicide missions of its Zero fighters in World War II, the Mitsubishi



printing press sale to the Washington Post is a kamikaze mission.  The



International Trade Commission found that Mitsubishi is selling the massive



presses far below cost.  The International Trade Commission ruled that a

punitive tariff of 63% must be paid on these presses, and under Mitsubishi's



contract with the Washington Post, Mitsubishi shoulders this burden. In its

quest to dominate the newspaper printing press business, Mitsubishi is prepared



to sacrifice hundreds of millions of dollars.  </B>



<P><B>	Do we want Mitsubishi, or any foreign company, to control the printing



presses for American newspapers?  Do we want the Washington Post or the New

York Times to be held hostage to Mitsubishi when the newspaper needs spare



parts?</B>



<P><B>The Washington Post created compelling history by standing up to President



Richard Nixon about Watergate and the Pentagon Papers.  The Post knows the



difference between right and wrong and is not afraid to take on powerful



opposition.   I, therefore, call upon the Washington Post to do the right

thing- cancel the Mitsubishi contract and buy the superior American-made

printing presses.  </B>
