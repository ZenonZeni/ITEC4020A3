<H1>A Guide to Energy Efficient Ventilation</H1>
<HR>

<H3>by Martin W Liddament, Head of the AIVC</H3>

<P>
The purpose of the AIVC's new guide to ventilation is to review
ventilation in the context of achieving energy efficiency and
good indoor air quality. It is primarily concerned with providing
an introduction to the topic and encapsulates the knowledge and
experience derived from experts in all the participating countries
of the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre. Numerical descriptions
have been kept to a minimum, while emphasis is placed on describing
ventilation and the decision making involved in selecting and
planning for ventilation. By understanding this Guide, it is hoped
that the reader will be able to make fundamental judgements about
how much ventilation should be provided and how this should be
accomplished for optimum cost and energy efficiency.
<P>
This guide is specifically aimed at the policy maker, architect,
building services engineer, designer and building owners and occupiers
who require a background knowledge to ventilation.

Structured in twelve chapters the first considers the role of
ventilation. It looks at the need for ventilation to meet metabolic
needs (oxygen and odour control), the minimum acceptable ventilation
rate and at additional requirements to meet the (polluting) activities
of occupants (e.g. smoking, cooking, unvented clothes drying etc.).
<P>
It is argued that too often it falls upon ventilation to accomplish
tasks for which it is not intended.

Chapter 2 reviews indoor air quality. Good indoor air quality
may be defined as air which is free of pollutants that cause irritation,
discomfort or ill health to occupants. Thermal conditions and
relative humidity also influence comfort and health. A poor indoor
environment can manifest itself as a 'sick' building in which
some occupants experience mild illness symptoms during periods
of occupancy. More serious pollutant problems may result in long
term and permanent ill-health effects. Since much time is spent
inside buildings, considerable effort has focused on methods to
achieve an optimum indoor environment, with particular emphasis
on health, odour control, thermal comfort and energy efficiency.

<P>
<I>Aspects of Indoor Air Quality are discussed with particular
emphasis on providing an overview of indoor air quality in relation
to:</I>
<UL>
<LI>Sources of Pollutant
<LI>Metabolism and Health
<LI>Odour
<LI>Sick buildings
<LI>Comfort
<LI>Reducing Pollutant Concentration

Aspects of energy impact are outlined in Chapter 3. A considerable
proportion of the energy consumed in buildings is lost by ventilation
and air infiltration. This has important implications both at
the consumer level, where the cost must normally be met, and at
the strategic level, where it contributes to primary energy need
and environmental pollution. Since ventilation is so closely linked
to concern about indoor air quality, there is the further problem
of identifying how much ventilation is needed to provide for a
healthy indoor environment.
<P>
Since it is difficult to assess the energy impact of ventilation,
the context of air change in relation to energy use is often undefined.
As a consequence, no adequate datum exists from which strategic
planning for improving the energy efficiency of ventilation can
be developed. This difficulty stems from the enormous complexity
of the task, which needs to accommodate wide variations in factors
such as climate, building air tightness, occupancy patterns and
approaches to ventilation. Efforts to overcome these difficulties
are progressing and an attempt is made in Chapter 3 to outline
the results of present progress.<A NAME="ch4"></A>
<P>
Chapter 4 focuses on ventilation design criteria. A ventilation
system must be designed to satisfy the required demand. In meeting
this need it is necessary to consider a wide range of criteria,
varying from meeting the needs of Building Regulations to planning
for maintenance and replacement (Figure 2). It is also necessary
to integrate the ventilation system itself into the overall design
of the building, especially in relation to air tightness, room
partitioning and accessibility.
<P>
Since such a wide range of parameters is involved, there is rarely
a unique solution to a particular ventilation design. Instead
the designer must base a judgement on the individual needs of
each building. Ultimately a robust solution is needed which ensures
the health and comfort of occupants. Ventilation needs must be
based on criteria that can be established at the design stage
of a building. To return afterwards in an attempt to mitigate
problems as they arise may lead to considerable expense and failure.

Strategies for ventilation are reviewed in Chapter 5. A wide range
of systems and techniques is available to meet the needs of ventilation
with each having its own set of advantages, disadvantages and
applications. Sometimes choice is dictated by local climate conditions
or building type. Frequently, price competitiveness and an unwillingness
to deviate from the minimum specification of relevant Building
Regulations or Codes of Practice can further restrict choice and
also limit the opportunity for innovation. To justify a complex
strategy, it is usually necessary to demonstrate advantages in
terms of improved indoor climate, reduced energy demand and acceptable
'payback' periods. Strategies reviewed cover both natural and
mechanical systems.<A NAME="ch6"></A>
<P>
Chapter 6 looks at the potential for ventilation heat recovery.
Considerable energy is lost from a building through the departing
air stream. When air change is dominated by infiltration, little
can be done to re-capture this energy. On the other hand, if exhaust
air is centrally collected, a variety of methods for recovering
or recycling the waste heat become possible. In view of the scale
of ventilation energy loss, considerable effort has been devoted
to the design and development of ventilation air heat recovery
systems.
<P>
While the heat recovery process can be shown to be extremely efficient,
benefits must always be equated against the (primary) energy needed
to drive the process and capital and maintenance costs. Various
hidden losses such as air infiltration must also be thoroughly
understood.<A NAME="ch7"></A>
<P>
Ventilation and cooling is reviewed in Chapter 7. Cooling is needed
when the indoor environment becomes excessively hot or humid.
This may occur as a result of high outdoor temperatures or as
a consequence of excessive solar or internal heat gains. High
internal gain is particularly a problem in large non-domestic
buildings.
<P>
When the need for cooling is dictated by internal heat gains rather
than outside temperature and humidity, much can be accomplished
to reduce the need for or eliminate altogether active cooling
systems. Solutions depend on climate but include cooling by ventilation
(passive cooling), designing for reduced solar gains, the use
of thermal mass and restricting internal heat loads.<A NAME="ch8">
</A>
<P>
The role of filtration to clean ventilation air is explored in
Chapter 8. Filtration is a method by which particulates and, sometimes,
gaseous pollutants may be removed from the air. Pollutants are
intercepted by a filter while allowing clean air to pass through.
This method of air cleaning is especially necessary when high
concentrations of particulates are present or when the source
of pollutant is derived from outside the building. Potential benefits
can include improved air quality, reduced dependence on ventilation
and improved energy efficiency. Filtration is not a substitute
for the ventilation needed to meet the metabolic requirements
of occupants.<A NAME="ch9"></A>
<P>
Ventilation Efficiency and the process of air mixing is outlined
in Chapter 9. Indices of ventilation efficiency characterise the
mixing behaviour of air and the distribution of pollutant within
a space. These two aspects may be subdivided into indices of air
change efficiency and pollutant removal effectiveness respectively.
Ventilation efficiency is based on an evaluation of the 'age',
of air and on the concentration distribution of pollutant within
the air. Some indices are based on room averaged values, while
others refer to specific points or locations. This has important
consequences because while room values provide some guidance to
the overall performance of a ventilation system, point values
indicate regions where localised poor ventilation might occur.
<A NAME="ch10"></A>
<P>
Chapter 10 looks at maintenance issues. Maintenance is needed
to ensure the reliability of the ventilation system and to secure
the economic operation of the ventilation plant. Evidence suggests,
however, that maintenance is often inadequate and that the need
for maintenance may even be ignored in the course of building
design. Typical problems include worn gaskets, dirty fans and
grilles, and ill-fitting and clogged filters. This concern has
resulted in much more specific guidelines being developed for
the maintenance of ventilation systems, some of which are discussed
in Chapter 10. Only by correct functioning can a ventilation system
be relied upon to meet the indoor air quality needs of a building.
<A NAME="ch11"></A>
<P>
Measurement methods are reviewed in Chapter 11. Measurements are
needed to verify the performance of ventilation systems and to
test the integrity of the building shell. They are essential for
commissioning, diagnostic analysis, design evaluation and research.
In addition, measurement results provide the fundamental means
for understanding the mechanics of ventilation and air flow in
buildings. Measurement data are also needed to provide background
information for parametric studies on building air leakage characteristics,
indoor air quality and ventilation system performance. Many measurement
techniques have been developed with each having a specific purpose.
An analysis of principal measurement techniques and applications
is presented.<A NAME="ch12"></A>
<P>
Finally, Chapter 12 reviews recent developments in calculation
techniques. Calculation techniques and numerical models are essential
for any design process. They provide the means by which the designer
can develop and investigate an idea before being committed to
the final product.
<P>
Typical design aspects cover system sizing, performance evaluation,
indoor air quality prediction, energy impact assessment, and cost
benefit analysis. A calculation technique or model is used to
analyse the interaction of design options with fixed constraints.
Such a process is necessarily iterative, with adjustments made
to parameters over which control is possible, until an optimum
design solution is achieved.
<P>
A wide range of methods of varying complexity have been developed
with no single method being universally appropriate. Selection
varies according to the required level of accuracy, the availability
of data and the type of building under investigation.
<P>
As designs have become more complex and performance tolerances
more demanding, it is increasingly important for the designer
to be able to understand and use calculation techniques. This
need has resulted in the development of improved algorithms and
wider availability of design data.
<P>
Techniques cover methods to determine:
<UL>
<LI>air change rates in buildings and rooms.
<LI>the flow rate of air through infiltration and purpose provided
flow openings (network methods).
<LI>air flow pattern in a space (computational fluid dynamics).
</UL>

Subsidiary calculations cover pollutant transport, energy analysis
and the evaluation of driving forces (wind and stack effect).
