<font size="2">The government's strategy for stopping the production and trafficking of
cocaine and heroin destined for the United States suffers from a lack of
interagency coordination, poor funds management, and a lack of
commitment from some foreign governments to combat the drug trade in
their countries. Although the United States has changed its
international strategy on cocaine from one of law enforcement and drug
seizures in the transit zone to one of stopping drugs in the sources
counties, the executive branch has had difficulty in implementing a key
part of the strategy---shifting resources from the transit zone to
source countries. Also, a proposed heroin strategy still awaits the
President's approval.  Moreover, the willing and the ability of foreign
governments to fight the drug trade varies.  Recent steps taken by the
Colombian government, such as the arrests of high-level members of the
Cali Cartel, have been positive, but continuing commitment is needed.
Even when foreign governments are willing to fully participate in
counternarcotics efforts, they often lack the necessary resources.
Extensive corruption in some countries further undercuts efforts to stop
the drug trade.
