The Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) is a professional degree
program that focuses on the <EM>technical,
managerial and policy issues associated with building computer-based
information systems for modern organizations.</EM> 
Information is the life-blood of every enterprise, both private and public,
and the MSIS program addresses the theoretical and practical aspects of
specifying, designing, implementing, and managing information systems.
The program prepares
students for research and professional practice in the above areas.

<HR>
<P>
<H2>The MSIS program is unique in two respects: </H2>
<P>
<DL>
<LI>1) it provides a balance  between the technical and management aspects of 
information systems, and
<P> 
<LI>2) it accepts students with baccalaureate degrees in disciplines such as 
business, arts and sciences, computer science, and engineering.
</DL>

<P>
The MSIS student studies the core topics of <I>computer organization, programming
languages, operating systems, operations research and management, database
management, computer communication networks and distributed applications, systems
analysis and design, and information system policy and administration</I>. 
<P>
Through <A HREF = "elective.html"> elective courses </A> the student may acquire knowledge and skills in the
areas of office information systems, secure information systems,  software systems engineering , information systems engineering, data engineering, knowledge
engineering, decision support systems, user interface design, artificial
intelligence, graphics, and programming language environments.
<P>
An MSIS graduate can look forward to pursuing a career in areas such as: 
database administration, management and engineering, database application
programming, systems analysis and design, information engineering, knowledge
engineering, network design and administration, systems integration, and the
management of information systems. 
<P>
The program is offered by the faculty of the Department of Information and
Software Systems Engineering (ISSE).  Many classes are scheduled in the late
afternoon and early evening to accommodate the professionally employed student.
