<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How safe are the French tests?</B></FONT><P>
<B>Since 1945, the nuclear powers have exploded<BR>
 more than 2,000 nuclear devices.<BR> 
The French have exploded 175 in the Pacific</B></CENTER>.
<P>
50 years into the nuclear age, it seems we're finally coming to our senses. Next 
year the major nuclear powers look set  to sign a treaty banning just about all 
nuclear testing. But before it signs, France insists on slipping in 8 more 
underground tests.<P>
<P>
The outrage at the French government's decision is universal: it's been decried 
as arrogant colonialism, jeopardising progress to a nuclear weapons-free 
world.<P>
But there's also the strong belief that French nuclear tests have contaminated 
the Pacific and its people.<P>
<P>
<B>Given the litany of lies we've been told about nuclear tests - from the 
Marshall Islands to Maralinga -  people are understandably sceptical of 
France's assurance that all is safe. Claims that France's testing has 
poisoned the environment and caused cancers and birth defects are of 
great concern, but must be viewed in the light of the available facts. 
Tonight, we weigh up the scientific evidence. Is radioactivity the real 
danger?</B><P>

Radioactivity is something we  all have to live with, all the time. Cosmic rays 
from space, traces of radioactive elements in soil and our food; they make up 
what's called natural or background radioactivity. For Australia and South Pacific 
nations that's measured as 2 <I>MilliSieverts</I> a year. <P>
<P>
To put that in perspective: every time you have a medical procedure like a CAT 
scan or barium meal, you're exposed to about 4 times that radioactivity, up to 
8mS.  <P>
<P>
Most experts agree the 2 mS background radiation does us little or no harm. But 
when it comes to additional radioactivity: the less you're exposed to, the 
better.<p>
<p>
<H2><B>FALLOUT FROM ATMOSPHERIC TESTS</B></H2><P>

<B>Fallout is the radioactive byproduct of nuclear explosions. The greatest 
danger to humans are the radionuclides caesium 137, iodine 131, strontium 
90 and plutonium 239.</B><P>

In March 1954 the United States exploded a 15 megaton 
bomb on Bikini Atoll. People on some nearby Marshall Islands received a 
tragically high dose of radioactivity, with tragically clear results: thyroid disease 
and cancers, for which the United States belatedly paid compensation. <P>
We know from the survivors of the first nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki that doses of radioactivity above  around 500 mS do cause extra 
cancers and birth defects in a population. The Marshall Islanders were exposed 
to four times that level, nearly 2,000mS. The case is not so clear cut in French 
Polynesia.<P>
<B>Between 1966 and 1974, France exploded 41 atmospheric tests in 
French Polynesia. The total yield was 15 megatons equal to one US test on 
Bikini atoll.</B><P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font>.<BR>
<I>"Our estimate is that on average in the Pacific Islands from the entire history 
of atmospheric weapons tests individuals in the islands would have received 
around about one miliSievert over their entire life times from that testing."</I></CENTER>
<P>
One mS spread over 50 years. How can we be sure the exposure was so 
low? The figures come from the Australian Radiation Lab and the National 
Radiation Lab in NZ. Both exist to monitor radiation hazards and protect the 
populations. The labs have no vested interest in the nuclear industry - NZ 
doesn't even have a nuclear reactor.<P>

During the whole period of French atmospheric testing New Zealand monitored 
the levels of fallout at their network of South Pacific stations. <P>
The fallout was low, but uneven. There were rainouts, times when winds blew a 
cloud of radioactivity over island populations. If it rained, fallout rained down 
too.<P>

<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b> <BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font>.<BR>
<I>"The most significant event occurred in 1966 when there was what we call 
a blow back from Mururoa towards Samoa in particular where the from the test 
went westward instead of eastward and it was caught in a heavy rain event at 
Samoa and this resulted in quite a lot of local contamination even then though 
the dose in that year from that event would have only been around naught point 
two miliSieverts.</I><P>
<I><B>Q.</B> So that's still a tenth of the background radiation?<P>
<B>A.</B>	1/10 of the annual background."</I></CENTER><P>
<B>There was another rainout in Tahiti in 1974, but again fallout was well 
below background. We know of one other rainout, in the Gambier Islands, 
just to the southeast of Mururoa. Fallout was higher, 4 mS, twice 
background radiation, but many hundreds of times lower than Marshall 
islands. Now, some of these figures do come from France's monitoring 
stations, but they closely correspond to the levels and patterns of fallout 
monitored by New Zealand.</B><P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"The radiation doses were so low that no effects from radiation would be 
expected. If there is no radiation there can be no radiation effects."</I>
</CENTER><P>
So what are we to make of the worrying claims that birth defects and cancer 
rates have increased in French Polynesia since the tests? As harsh as it may 
seem, reports of an increase of birth defects are all anecdotal - there simply isn't 
a register of birth defects in French Polynesia. And while evidence is building 
that cancers are increasing, there are other explanations.<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"Increasing cancers will rise if the people live longer, if the life expectancy 
goes up then the cancer rates go up because cancer rates increase with age.  
Another cause of increased cancer is changes and life style factors such as 
increases in smoking and if the population is smoking heavily then there will be a 
very considerable rise in lung cancers and other cancers."</I></CENTER><P>
<p>
<H2><B>LEAKAGE FROM UNDERGROUND TESTS</B></H2><P>
<B>The French still contend their atmospheric tests were safe, but they did 
respond to international pressure on health concerns. In 1975, more than a 
decade after Britain, the US and Russia moved their nuclear tests 
underground, the French finally followed suit. But while other nuclear 
powers moved out of the Pacific, the French stayed put. And on this 
question the scientific consensus is the French were mistaken. An atoll is 
no place to store nuclear waste.</B><P>
Mururoa is a seamount- formed more than 7 million years ago when a volcano 
erupted beneath  the sea. When lava hits cold water it forms intertwining tubes 
of rock, which build up a mountain.<P>
The mountain erodes leaving a basalt base and a middle layer of soil. The top 
layer of limestones and corals leaks like a sieve.<P>

<CENTER><b>Prof Michael Michael O'Sullivan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>University of Auckland</font><BR>
<I>"There's a very permeable zone from the level where the arrow at about 400 
hundred meters below sea level up to the surface and that consists of limestones 
which are naturally very permeable and very leaky and the heavy ocean water 
here drives the water through the atoll up into the lagoon."</I></CENTER><P>
Any nuclear waste would get through these middle and top layers very 
quickly. But the shafts for the underground tests are up to 1,000 metres deep in the 
basalt base, supposedly well clear of the leaky layers.<P>
<CENTER><b>Megan James</b><BR>
<I>"What happens when you add a nuclear explosion or two according to the 
French?"</I><P>
<b>Prof Michael Michael O'Sullivan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>University of Auckland</font><BR>
<I>"Well we detonate a bomb//down in these deep basalts and then what the 
French claim is this kind of scenario where we have a chamber here which 
consists of glassified rock which is broken up in little lumps and surrounding that 
they say the rock is not very badly effected. So the natural flow of water is 
virtually unaffected by the bomb going off and radioactivity is safe down in the 
volcanic rock."</I></CENTER><P>
But there's a problem. The French claim the chamber is sealed, yet cools 
quickly. The only way it could cool quickly is if the chamber is really so cracked it 
allows cooling water to get in and out.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Prof Michael Michael O'Sullivan</b>,<BR>
<font size=-1>University of Auckland</font><BR>
<I>"Now we have a large fractured chamber// Then the water can get down into 
the bomb site and up again."</I></CENTER>
<P>
Professor O'Sullivan concludes radioactivity must, in time, leak out. Is it leaking 
now?<P>
<P>
The latest evidence we can now reveal strongly supports France's claim 
underground testing has not poisoned the marine environment.<P>
<P>
These are samples of foodstuffs collected on Mururoa by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. Fish from the lagoon, spiny lobster, molluscs and 
coconut milk.<P>
<P>
The Australian Radiation Laboratory was one of 8 around the world given samples 
of the same organisms collected at the same time. The analysis shows there is 
radioactivity in the samples, but the levels are <B>very low</B>.<P>
<P>
The results are credible because all 8 labs concur. Among them was New 
Zealand's National Radiation Laboratory.<P>

<CENTER><b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><BR>
<i>"The levels in those fish did show traces of Caesium 137 and strontium 90 
which one would expect and the levels were fairly consistent with what one 
would expect from global fallout but there is certainly no evidence of significant 
leakage of any type."</I></CENTER><P>
Mururoa may not be leaking now, yet even the French admit the radioactive 
waste stored under their feet will eventually escape. But they say it won't be for 
thousands, perhaps 10,000 years. <P>
<P>
The French claim the basalt that forms the base of Mururoa is not very porous; 
so any water in the blast chambers will take thousands of years to move through 
the rock. But there's good evidence it will happen much more quickly than 
that.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Megan James</b><BR>
"<I>So these are actually samples from Mururoa itself?"</I><P><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR><Font size=-1> University of Sydney</font><br>
<I>"That's correct."</I></CENTER>
<P><I>
</I>Professor Peter Davies visited Mururoa in the early 80s. He studied just how 
porous the atoll's base is. Some parts are far leakier than others.<P><CENTER><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR><I>"If you look at this sample for example there are nicks and cracks through the sample indicating that there are fisures which run through the sample and 
that is very important in terms of the conactivity of the pores in other words how 
water will transport through the rock."</I><P>
<b>Megan James</b><br><I>
</I><I>"And from the variety of porosities that you're looking at here how did you 
redo the sums on the how long it would take for leakage to occur from these 
basalt chambers?"</I><P>
<b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<I>"From that I calculated best case scenarios of greater than 500 years for 
leakage fluids from the middle of the atoll."</I><P>
<B>Megan James</B><BR><I> "And a worst case scenario?"</I><P>
<b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR><I>"Well the worst case scenario is related to something happening 
associated with the test and that's almost instantaneous."</I></CENTER><P>
And accidents have happened. In July 1979, a 120 kiloton bomb got stuck 
halfway down the shaft, at 400 metres. They exploded it anyway, and because 
tests were then on the rim of the atoll, part of the southern side collapsed in an 
underwater landslide.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>University of Sydney</FONT><BR>
<I>"The French have admitted to some million cubic meters of rock having come 
away from the side of the atoll. Well a million cubic meters is substantial however 
think of what it means: it's a hundred meters by a hundred meters by a hundred 
meters// that is actually a small portion of the atoll but nevertheless// they've also 
moved their tests back into the lagoon. And I don't think that they have reported 
or anybody has reported land slides since."</I></CENTER><P>
Because the tests are now in the centre of the atoll, and the bombs are now 
smaller, the risk of a major collapes is very low. Long term leakage remains by 
far the most realistic scenario.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>University of Sydney</FONT><BR>
<I>"In 500 years or whatever it is and I don't know what the exact time is but at 
whatever time, there will be the potential for Mururoa to leak radionuclides into 
the biosphere."</I></CENTER><P>
But such leakage may not be as dangerous as we've been lead to believe.<P>
<p>
<H2><B> THE DANGER FROM LEAKAGE</B></H2>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font>.<BR>
<I>"Well a key factor which seems to be overlooked in most people's arguments 
is just what the source term is, how much radioactivity is locked up in Mururoa 
after all of these tests, it seems that in many circles some people think a very 
large amount of radioactivity is there and it should be called into perspective how 
much is there.</I> "</CENTER><P>
<P>
The total fallout from all  atmospheric tests ever conducted is 300 megatons. 
The total of France's underground tests to date is just under 3 megatons. We 
know that from New Zealand's seismic monitoring stations. <P>
<P>
Most of that 3 megatons is locked in the glassy lining of the cavity created by the 
explosion. Only around 5% is loose in the blast chamber.Let's imagine for a 
moment that somehow it all leaked out tomorrow. Incredible as it may seem, the 
sums done by NZ's radiation scientists suggest there'd be no great danger to 
environment or health.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"Well most of our reasoning in this area is based on recommendations of the 
International Commission on radiological protection and that body produces 
recommendations for limits of intake - they call annual limits of intake and if all of 
the material presently in Mururoa were to dissolve in a lagoon that size if it were 
fresh water, one could drink around about 300 litres of that before one would 
reach the annual limit of intake".</I><P>
<b>Megan James</b><br>
<I>"What about in a couple of hundred years, which is the best estimate, what 
would be the danger then?"</I><P>
<b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><I> </I><BR>
<I>"Well if one goes to hundreds of years to the future, then the fission 
products of more particular concern like caesium 137, strontium, they have 
halflives of 30yrs, so going 90 years is going through three half lives that the total 
amount is down to 1/8th - go another 90 yrs it is down to a 64th so it is actually 
decaying away and if you go hundreds of years into the future then you probably 
haven't got a lot of radioactivity to worry about."</I></CENTER><P>
None of these scientists is saying that Mururoa is contamination-free. It's 
known that in 1981 a typhoon washed between 10-20 kgms of plutonium, the 
legacy of earlier weapons safety tests, into the lagoon. Plutonium, when it's in 
the air and can be inhaled, is one of the deadlies substances we know. But in a 
marine environment like the lagoon, plutonium gets very strongly bound up in 
sediments, very little gets into the food chain. (as confirmed by the latest IAEA 
study.)<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Megan James</b>:<BR><I>
</I><I>A lot of people might interpret this information as scientists saying that the 
testing is ok. That it can go ahead?</I><P>
<b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
 <Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"Well there are two distinct sets of issues related to Mururoa as the public see 
it. There are the what I would call political philosophical issues of whether we 
want weapons to be developed, whether we want nuclear proliferation, whether 
we want more people with nuclear weapons on the planet, there are those 
political and philosophical issues and then there are the environmental ones 
which I have been talking about. All I'm saying is that the environmental issues 
are not as great as people will appear to think they are".</I><P>
<b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>University of Sydney</FONT><BR>
<I>"The French are their own worst enemy. I think they have a huge data 
base which if shared properly with the scientific community would help to dispell 
many many of the problems that people currently relate to what is happening at 
Mururoa because on the basis of easily verifiable experiments it would be 
possible to show that much of the French data is correct. But they label 
everything confidential and therefore it never sees the light of day-  it does them 
no good at all I said this to them in 1984."</I></CENTER><P>
<P>
<H1><B>THE REAL DANGER OF TESTS</B></H1>
<P>
The weight of scientific evidence is that the test pose no great danger to human 
health or the environment of the region. The real danger is that France's and 
China's resumption of testing may derail progress to a world free of nuclear 
weapons.<P>
<P>
<center><b>Dr Karin von Strokirch</b><br>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"Well President Chirac gave the most detailed statement about the purpose 
of the nuclear tests one month after his announcement of test resumption. He 
explained to the French senate in Paris that of the eight tests four would be used 
to perfect computer simulation of nuclear tests two would be used to test the 
reliability and effectiveness of ageing detonators and fuses and the remainder, 
that is to say two, would be used to test what he called a new war 
head."</I><P></center>
<B>That new warhead may be TN75, the TN100 or a new generation 
variable yield warhead: potential first strike weapons.</B><P>
Many of the new generation nuclear warheads are small enough for their 
testing to  be hidden.<P>
<CENTER><B>Dr Peter Wills</B><br>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Greenpeace Spokesperson</FONT><br>
<I>"The thing that really makes me suspicious is that the military the French 
military wanted to to conduct 20 tests they said before France signed the 
comprehensive test ban now that makes me wonder if the eight tests which have 
announced involve something of the order of 20 devices rather than just eight as 
you would have thought."</I><P><b>Dr Karin von Strokirch</b><br>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"Well I believe that in the past the United States has conducted two nuclear 
weapons test explosion simultaneously, there's no reason to believe that France 
can't do that."</I></CENTER><P>
If the French do test 2 devices simultaneously, we won't know. The 
Seimological Centre in Canberra will be the first place in Australia to detect any 
explosion. But from this distance, they can't identify an explosion under 1 kt, if 
masked by a larger one. <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Dr Peter Wills</B><br>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Greenpeace Spokesperson</FONT><br>
<I>"In the broader picture in the long run the reason to have a comprehensive 
test ban and to stop testing is to inhibit the development of nuclear weapons and 
the great offence which France is causing at the moment is that they say they will 
sign the comprehensive test ban when they have developed the means for 
circumventing it."</I></CENTER><P>
Those means are computers. France needs the field data from the Mururoa 
tests to perfect its computer simulation programs. But even if we stopped the 
French tests, other nuclear nations could continue the electronic version of the 
arms race. Because even under the proposed treaty banning all field tests, 
nuclear weapons are allwed to be developed and refined, via computers.<P>
<P>
We've directed all our protest efforts at trying to stop this series of French tests, 
as though stopping them would somehow stop the arms race. Perhaps our 
protests would be better directed at ensuring next year's treaty is comprehensive 
in its truest sense.<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Karin von Strokirch</b><br>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"No nuclear tests full stop no simulation full stop don't allow it nothing nothing 
is going to be allowed that will help a nation to develop nuclear weapons. 
"<P>
"The opportunity we have now for achieving a comprehensive test ban is 
greater than it's been at any time since nuclear weapons have been 
invented//</I><P><I>And the danger is if we don't achieve a ban within the coming year the 
political situation could change in any one of the main players' countries. For 
example the United States is having presidential elections Russia is looking 
towards presidential elections the Chinese paramount leader may die in the not 
too distant future and if the political context changes in one of the nuclear 
weapons states it may change the whole of the nature of the negotiations for a 
comprehensive test ban".</I><P>
<b>Megan James</b><br><I>"We would have lost that opportunity?"</I><P>
<B>Dr Karin von Strokirch</B><BR>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"Mmm this is a window of opportunity now and we need to take it 
while its there."<P>
