<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>
<P>
The U.S. election campaign has not yet emerged as a major factor
in the financial markets despite the rebound in the president's
lead over Robert Dole in the opinion polls.  <I>But if October
polls point to a Democratic sweep which could alter control of
the Congress, business confidence in the 1997 economic outlook
could start to deteriorate.</I>  The leadership of the Democratic
Party in the Congress is so far to the left of the president that
some Washington analysts describe a potential victory for it as
&quot;a return of the Dinosaurs&quot;.  The committee chairmanships
of a  Democratic controlled Congress would be dominated by elderly
members from old urban centers in the northeast and middle west
who launched their political careers during the 1960's.  The new
House speaker would also be a member of Congress who has spent
the past decade advocating protectionist trade policies and populist
domestic policies. 
<P>
As the election of a Democratic Congress would raise many questions
about economic policy, it would cause the financial markets to
become even more sensitive than usual to the cabinet appointments
which the president announced during December and the signals
they provided about the future conduct of policy.  The current
Treasury team enjoys a high level of confidence in the financial
markets, and it is widely expected that Secretary Robert Rubin
will remain but investors expect to see new appointments for other
key positions, such as Trade Representatives, Secretary of Commerce,
and chairman of the National Economic Council.  They also will
be anxious to see who replaces Dick Morris as the president's
major advisor on political strategy.  While Morris had little
influence on economic policy, he did steer the president towards
the right on many social issues (family values) and gave the administration
a very conservative tone compared to 1993.  As Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is a long experienced Washington operator, the large
Democratic lead in the opinion polls probably also had some influence
on the outcome of the September FOMC meeting.  Both Mr. Greenspan
and some Fed district presidents are aware that a Democratic Congress
would be far more intrusive into the affairs of the Federal Reserve
than the current Congress.

ALT="Can The Foreign Exchange Markets Ignore the Fed?"><BR>


The dollar remained relatively firm despite the Fed's failure
to tighten policy because other G-7 countries are still anxious
to promote dollar appreciation and the U.S. bond market reacted
positively to the Fed's policy.
<P>
The U.S. government's current account and capital account data
for the second quarter suggest that the dollar is being underpinned
by greater support from private investors, not just central banks.
The new data indicates that central bank intervention to support
the dollar fell to $13.2 billion during the second quarter from
$52 billion during the first quarter.  In place of official intervention,
foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities shot up to $31.7 billion
from $11.8 billion during the first quarter while purchases of
 other securities fell only modestly to $28.6 billion from $36
billion during the first quarter.  Meanwhile, American demand
for foreign securities slumped to $20 billion during the second
quarter from $34.4 billion during the first quarter.  Foreign
direct investment was also nearly in balance, with outward investment
of $46 billion during the first half compared to $40 billion of
inward investment.  During 1995, by contrast, official intervention
to support the dollar was $110 billion compared to foreign purchases
of Treasury securities equal to $99 billion, foreign demand for
other securities of $95.2 billion and direct investment of $60
billion. In addition to a $148 billion current account deficit
during 1995, American demand for foreign securities was $98 billion
while outward direct investment was $96 billion.  <I>The magnitude
of the U.S. current account deficit and American demand for foreign
securities suggests the dollar will be vulnerable to renewed weakness
at some point but the willingness of future central banks to support
the  dollar is unlikely to change in the near future.</I>  In
fact, the IMF has just published its latest estimates of the distribution
of the world's foreign exchange reserves by currency.  According
to the IMF, the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves
rose modestly to 56.4% last year form 55.9% during 1994 and a
trough of 50.3% during 1990.  The D-mark's share fell to 13.7%
from 14.3% while the yen's share declined to 7.1% from 8.2%. 
It is the industrial countries which are spending most aggressively
to protect the dollar's international role.  The dollar's share
of their reserves rose to 52.8% from 51.2% while its share of
developing country reserves eased to 60.5% from 61.8%.  While
it is not surprising that Japan and Europe are trying to resist
dollar depreciation, it is remarkable that Asian and Latin American
central banks have not been more aggressive in diversifying their
foreign exchange reserves out of dollars.
<P>
Europe and Japan want to encourage a strong dollar because their
own economies are still weak and they need to promote exports.
 Many European countries are also trying to adhere to exchange
rate target bands against the D-Mark and thus don't want the D-mark
to appreciate against the dollar.  The Bundesbank itself also
favors a weak D-mark because it is trying to discourage the support
of German industry for introducing a new European currency.
<P>
<I>The currency which has been most vulnerable to a speculative
attack during recent weeks has been the French franc.</I>  The
French economy is weak and the economic slowdown is undermining
the efforts of the French government to achieve a budget deficit
of less than 3.0% of GDP in order to satisfy the Maastricht economic
preconditions for European monetary union in 1999.  In mid-September,
the French government announced a new budget which introduced
some interesting accounting changes in order to achieve its deficit
target.  The French government, for example, will realize an accounting
gain of 40 billion francs in the current fiscal year by assuming
responsibility for the national telephone company's pension fund
before it is privatized.  Several journalists chastised the French
government for using such unconventional revenue enhancement techniques
in order to achieve its deficit target but investors did not sell
the franc because they consider the French effort to achieve a
smaller deficit to be  preferable to the alternative EMU strategy
which had appeared to be evolving a few months ago.  In mid-summer,
it was widely perceived that Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac
would attempt to impose EMU while accepting budget deficits closer
to 4.0% of GDP. <I> Investors bought the French franc in mid-September
because they considered the French government's effort to achieve
a smaller deficit through a spending freeze and unconventional
revenue enhancement to be superior to an economic strategy which
simply sacrificed deficit reduction targets to the greater goal
of European monetary union.</I>
<P>
<I>The French budget has not eliminated all risks to implementation
of EMU in 1999.</I>  If the French economy stalls this winter,
the government will not be able to achieve its revenue targets
and it will have to consider imposing even greater fiscal austerity
on an economy which already has high unemployment.  As France
will have parliamentary elections in March 1998, it will be difficult
for President Chirac to introduce another restrictive budget during
1997.  <I>In the absence of a French economic upturn, the odds
are high that the Chirac government would be forced to introduce
a new economic strategy including large interest rate reductions,
a devaluation of the franc, and an indefinite deferral of monetary
union.</I>  As the Germans are terrified of a large franc devaluation,
they would probably reduce interest rate further this winter in
order to help revive the French economy and maintain France's
current exchange rate policy.  The good news for the French government
is that the German and British economies are showing such clear
signs of revival that there should be positive spillover effects
on France.  But as France is suffering from deep structural problems
in its labor market and banking system, it is unclear if export
growth alone will be able to revive business and household confidence
by enough to stimulate domestic spending.
<P>
As the French government is prepared to consider unconventional
revenue sources in order to achieve its Maastricht deficit targets,
it will be interesting to see if the French government investigates
the feasibility of obtaining more revenue from the Bank of France.
 The French central bank is now independent of the government
in the conduct of monetary policy but the French government continues
to  be its only shareholder.  As a result, it would be appropriate
for the French government to examine whether its central bank
is observing the same fiscal austerity as other departments of
the French government in promoting deficit reduction.
