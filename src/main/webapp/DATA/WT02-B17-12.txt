<p>Our research focuses on the development of a stable, cost-effective, 
photoelectrochemistry-based system that will split water upon 
illumination, producing hydrogen and oxygen directly, using sunlight as 
the only energy input.  Our approach is to use the best available 
semiconductor materials and devices that are consistent with the energy 
requirements for a water-splitting system and that are stable in an 
aqueous environment.  Near-term goals include the development of 
transparent and highly active colloidal water-splitting catalysts coupled 
with surface modification techniques to increase the lifetime and 
efficiency of photoelectrochemical devices.
<P>
In current research work, we are developing novel photoelectrolysis 
devices based on 
tandem solar cell technology.  This technology includes devices made of 
gallium indium 
phosphide/gallium arsenide and amorphous silicon/silicon carbide.  We are 
looking for industry partners who are interested in developing this 
technology for commercial applications, and we are especially interested 
in partnerships with semiconductor manufacturers and all those 
involvedwith transparent catalytic coatings.

<I>Recent Advances:</I>
We developed synthetic procedures for synthesizing platinum and ruthenium 

dioxide colloidal catalysts and demonstrated that they are highly active 
for water 
oxidation and reduction when deposited on the surface of semiconductors.  
We also 
showed that multijunction devices made of gallium indium 
phosphide/gallium 
arsenide and amorphous silicon/silicon carbide can split water.  Work is 
continuing 
on improving the efficiency and lifetime of these devices.
