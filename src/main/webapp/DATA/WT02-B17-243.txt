<H3>What is Superconductivity?</H3>
<p>
<h2>History</H2>

<p>                         
Early in the 20th century, Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes
observed that mercury displayed no electrical
resistance when cooled to very low temperatures. With this observation, 
the study of superconductivity was born.
<p>
For the next several decades, superconductors remained a scientific curiosity
with few practical applications. Then in 
the 1960s a practical superconducting metal wire made of niobium and
tin was developed. That wire, later made of a niobium and titanium alloy,
became the basis for the first applications of superconductors. 
<p>
The niobium and titanium alloy, still in use today, is among the materials
called low-temperature superconductors. Low-temperature
superconductors must be cooled to below 20 Kelvin (K) (-253<sup>o</sup>
Celsius [C]) in order to become superconducting. They are now
widely used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, machines, and
in the fields of high-energy physics and nuclear fusion.
Additional commercial use has been limited largely by the high
refrigeration costs associated with liquid helium, which is needed to cool the
materials to such low temperatures.
<p>
The hope for low-cost superconductivity was ignited by two
significant discoveries in the 1980s. In 1986, two IBM scientists
in Zurich, Alex M&#252;ller and Georg Bednorz, discovered a new class
of superconductors. Unlike the low-temperature superconductors,
which were metallic or semimetallic, these new compounds were
ceramic and were superconducting up to 35 K (-238<sup>o</sup>C). M&#252;ller and
Bednorz won a Nobel Prize for their discovery. Then in 1987, Paul
Chu at the University of Houston took the discovery one step
further and announced a compound that became superconducting at
94 K (-179<sup>o</sup>C). This discovery was particularly significant
because this compound could be cooled
with cheap and readily available liquid nitrogen. These new
materials were dubbed high-temperature superconductors.
<p>
Today's high-temperature superconductors are moving out of the
laboratory and into the marketplace. Bismuth-based
compounds are being fashioned into superconducting wires and
coils, which are essential to electric power uses. Thallium- and
yttrium-based compounds are being formed into the thin films used in electronic
devices. And, as superconductivity moves into the 21st century,
products such as superconducting motors, generators, fault-current limiters, energy storage systems, and power cables
promise to change forever the way electricity is generated,
delivered, and used.
