<h2>Education Update </h2>

</CENTER>


<p>Throughout the year hundreds of school children come to Redwings to learn about horses. A welcome addition to their experience was the opening of the Education Center in May. The Center allows for viewing of videos on horse issues as well as books, articles, information sheets and special horse related displays.</p>

<p>In June, Lynn Loar from the San Francisco Child Abuse Council teamed up with Redwings to host a workshop. As an expert in the connection between child and animal abuse, Lynn's participation cemented the success of our endeavor. The information was so well received that Redwings is sponsoring a conference on abuse this February (1997). Lynn will return as the keynote speaker and will be joined by other experts in the field of child and animal abuse.</p>

<p>If you, or someone you know, would like to attend or participate in this conference, please call Redwings at (408)624-8464.</p>

<p>Redwings offers educational classes and workshops throughout the year. If you are interested in a field trip, tour, or would like information on upcoming educational events, please call (408)624-8464.</p>
