<I>
Until recently, road vehicle drivetrains (engine, transmission and wheels) have been essentially the same regardless of vehicle size, operation profile and location. For various reasons, customers and manufacturers look to alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel cars, trucks and buses. </I>

<H4>Principles of vehicle propulsion</H4>


<P>Electric and hybrid vehicles differ from conventional vehicles by the means of propulsion. In a conventional vehicle, a gasoline or diesel engine turn the wheels through a transmission including a clutch and a gearbox. <BR><BR>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=362 HEIGHT=256  SRC="ehvpic/princip.gif">
<BR>

An advanced EV or hybrid needs none of this. Some cars, especially heavier vehicles, use electric motors with only one moving part: the wheel itself. The dominating solution, though, is to have a front-mounted electric motor turning the wheels through a reduction gearbox and a simple driveshaft. This means a drastic reduction in the number of moving parts compared to a gasoline powered vehicle.
</P>





<P> Electric vehicles ("EVs") are radically different from today's gasoline powered vehicle in several ways. Instead of storing gasoline, the EV stores electric energy in a large, rechargeable battery. A vehicle system controller sends this power to the electric drive motor whenever the driver pushes down on the accelerator pedal.

<B>EV engine configuration</B> <BR>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=114  SRC="ehvpic/bakv.gif" align=right>
Most modern EVs also have a feature called "regenerative" brakes. Apart from generating friction heat when braking (like the disc or drum brakes of gasoline vehicles), an EV can also use the EV motor to help brake the vehicle, thereby generating electricity which charges the battery. Regenerating brakes also reduces the wear on the mechanic brakes.</P><BR><BR>

<H2>EV unique features:</H2>




<P><B>Clean</B> EVs have no tailpipe emissions. Such emissions, if any, are generated and controlled at the
electric powerplant. In Sweden, electricity is produced from about equal shares of hydropower and nuclear energy. A few percent is produced by burning fossil fuels, predominantly wintertime.

</P>





<P><B>Quiet</B> The more advanced EV motors emit almost no sound. Unlike gasoline vehicles, there is
no "combustion" requiring a muffler. In fact, the EV is so quiet that the EV
development teams have to work harder to "silence" other noisy components (like air
conditioning and power steering) which become audible without the gasoline engine
noise.</P>




<P><B>Smooth</B> Electric motor vehicles require no clutch or gearshift. Most advanced EVs use single-speed AC motors with no transmission. Acceleration is smooth and seamless, smoother than the best transmission on today's luxury cars.</P>



<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=142  HEIGHT=190  SRC="ehvpic/tanka.gif" align=left ><B>Home Recharging</B> The EV can be recharged at home. Most of the vehicle users mainly recharge their vehicle at night. This is especially convenient for those who don't like to refuel at gasoline stations. The downside is it can take up to seven hours to recharge an "empty" battery.<BR>
<BR>


<P><B>Limited Range</B> 
Today's EV either uses the less expensive lead acid batteries or more advanced batteries like nickel metal hydride or nickel cadmium. Vehicle range depends largely on the type of battery used, but also, vehicle weight, driving style and other components such as charger and traction motor affects the range. Equipped with lead-acid batteries, the typical Lead acid powered EVs only have about 50 miles range between charges but are the least expensive. Advanced batteries have about 100 miles range between charges but are very expensive. </P>

<H2><!-- Font Tag -->Hybrid vehicles</H2>

<I>Hybrid passenger vehicles are usually configured as an EV with an additional primary power source such as a small gasoline, or, preferably, a biofuels engine. The engine propels a generator, which charges the batteries and provides energy to the tractionary engine. In general, hybrid vehicle development is in an earlier stage than that of the EV. </I>

<H4>Hybrid vehicle drivetrains</H4>
