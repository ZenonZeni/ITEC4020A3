<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>NYLCare of the Southwest Achieves Dramatic Results with
Asthma
Program</STRONG></FONT><P>

NYLCare Southwest recently teamed up with a company specializing in education for
asthma
patients to help a group of NYLCare members monitor asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary
disease, a related condition. After implementing the respiratory wellness program,
developed
by AccuLab Diagnostics, there was an extraordinary improvement for the group. Here
are
the
highlights of the program:<P>

<STRONG>Some Key Results</STRONG>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/nylcare/images/mcrpasim.gif" ALT="Graph" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="258" BORDER="0">
<UL>
<LI>In the six months prior to introducing the respiratory wellness program, there had
been 59
emergency room visits. In the six months after the program was introduced, there
were only
4
ER visits--a 93% reduction.
<LI>In the six months before the program began, school-age members missed 51 days
of
school;
in the six months since, only 2 days of school were missed-a 96% reduction.
<LI>Average medical cost per asthma patient over a six-month period declined from
$5,875.86
to $27.59.
</UL>

<STRONG>How did they do it?</STRONG> 
<P>
It turns out that the AccuLab staff is comprised of licensed
respiratory
therapists who visit NYLCare members in their homes.
<P>



"You can tell a whole lot about possible triggers when you go to a person's home,"
says
Michele Smith, RN, Manager of Utilization Management and Case Management at NYLCare
of the
Southwest.  "And the respiratory therapists have a lot of specific, practical
advice to
impart. For instance, dog owners are advised to rinse their pets with distilled
water after
shampooing to lower the animal's impact on the owner's airways."<P>
<P>

Smith says that sometimes a primary care physician will "inherit" a patient with
asthma,
decide the patient has the condition under control, and continue prescribing a
medicine the
patient has been taking in the past. In the respiratory wellness program, the
respiratory
therapist, working closely with a physician, can go back to square one in assessing
the
patient's condition and treatment options. Together, they often find ways to help
the patient
manage the disease better. "It's very satisfying to achieve these kinds of results
for our
members," Smith concludes.<P>


The chart to the right shows the sharp decline in the number of school days and work days
missed
due
to
asthma after the respiratory wellness program was introduced.
