<p>February 22, 1995 </p>

<p>Philip W. Perry </p>

<p>Special Agent in Charge </p>

<p>U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>Rocky Mountain Division Field Headquarters </p>

<p>115 Inverness Dr. East </p>

<p>Englewood, CO 80112 </p>

<p>Mr. Perry: </p>

<p>This letter is in response to your fax of February 16, 1995.
Let me say at the beginning that it is, at the very least,
unfortunate that this &quot;dialog&quot; is taking place after
the Committee hearing on SB 95-132. </p>

<p>Contrary to what you may believe, I respect your organization
and can appreciate the difficulty of your position, but I do not
agree with the way you handled SB 95-132. As the author of that
Bill, I stand behind my work and take personal offense to your
letter. Your comments and concerns regarding that Bill could have
been helpful had you responded to my letter of January 12 or
returned one of my many phone calls, seeking comment from your
office. Instead you waited to respond until two hours before the
final Committee hearing. Thus making a response or amendment
impossible and effectively ambushing our efforts. Nevertheless,
your comments should not and will not go unanswered. </p>

<p>First, and perhaps most damaging, were your comments regarding
the federal law. You may be &quot;an expert in drug law
enforcement,&quot; but you are not a lawyer and it seems from
your comments that you are not an expert in the law. Your letter
represents a serious misreading of federal law and a
misunderstanding of Congressional policy. At no time, since
cannabis was first regulated in 1937, has Congress ever expressed
an intent to outlaw the legitimate hemp industry. At
Congressional hearings after the World War II &quot;Hemp for
Victory&quot; campaign, Will S. Wood, Deputy Commissioner of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics (forerunner of your organization),
guaranteed that marijuana regulation would not have a negative
impact on the commercial hemp industry. Congress provided for
regulation of the hemp industry in all its legislation until the
early 1970s. When Congress stopped, the right to regulate
commercial hemp farmers reverted back to the states under the
tenth amendment. The federal government continues to recognize
the legitimacy of the hemp industry in international treaties and
by failing to list hemp producing nations as &quot;drug
source&quot; countries for marijuana. Finally on June 3, 1994,
President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919 which includes
hemp in a list of essential national resources. The federal law
is far from clear regarding the interplay between federal
marijuana laws and the legitimate hemp industry. At a minimum,
this is a question to be resolved by a federal court after
appropriate argument, not one that can be dictated by your
uninformed supposition. </p>

<p>Second, you candidly admit that you are not an expert in crop
economics, but only after you write that, &quot;The claims. . .
that Colorado would derive some economic benefit from the
commercial production of. . . [hemp are] deceptive.&quot; At
least thirty nations, including France, England, Australia,
Canada and China, disagree with your conclusions. Each has, or is
developing, a commercial hemp industry. The Chinese government
recently allocated thirty million dollars toward the production
of a hemp processing mill. I can only assume that &quot;some
economic benefit&quot; is the motivation. Again it is unfortunate
that you took it upon yourself to forestall Colorado's
opportunity to explore this potential industry for another year. </p>

<p>Finally, are your remarks regarding my character and that of
Senator Casey. You dismiss this legislation that we worked for
almost a year to prepare as &quot;a shallow ruse being advanced
by those to seek to legalize marijuana.&quot; Without the
professional courtesy to even respond to one of my phone calls,
you have no right to level such accusations against me or the
Senator. The hardest part about drafting SB 95-132 was creating
the legal distinction between hemp and marijuana where a
scientific and cognitive distinction already exists. This is the
part where I solicited your help. It is significant to note that
NORML and the other groups thought I did a sufficient job. They
refused to endorse the Bill because it specifically kept
marijuana laws in place. Had you contacted me, you would have
found that my motivation in writing this Bill was not to legalize
marijuana. Rather it stems from the Persian Gulf War where I sent
four of my soldiers across the world to fight for oil. It also
stems from the years I have spent trying to slow the cutting in
our nation's forests. Cutting which will be significantly
curtailed in Colorado in light of the recent block of the Long
Draw and Dudley Horsefly timber cuts. Despite your non-expert
assurances, deforestation continues to be a problem in the United
States and the World. SB 95-132 was one more attempt to slow it
down. Please refrain from further attempts to publicly disparage
my reputation regarding this issue. </p>

<p>Further, and more important, at age 68, Senator Casey is
hardly what one considers an advocate of the drug culture. Lloyd
Casey is an intelligent, honorable and courageous man for
sponsoring this Bill. You, on the other hand, are none of those
things for scuttling it at the last minute. But I must admit, you
were successful, this time. Next time, your element of surprise
will be gone. Rangers generally only get ambushed once. Again it
is unfortunate that our communication must take an adversarial
tone, rather than one of cooperation. However, remember that I do
respect the work that you are doing for our nation, I thank you
and I look forward to engaging you with words. Whether in
cooperation or not, we are destined to work together. Until next
time, keep your head down and, &quot;Make the most of the hemp
seed, sow it everywhere!&quot; </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>
