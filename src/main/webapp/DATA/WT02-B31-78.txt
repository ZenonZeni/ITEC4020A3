</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Life Insurance Protection For You and Your
Family</STRONG><BR>
New York Life, in cooperation with thousands of employers across the
country, offers a program
that can assist 
employees in providing protection and
financial security
for themselves and their families. This program allows employees of
participating companies
to purchase
individual permanent life insurance, through voluntary payroll
deduction, upon answering a
few simple
medical questions.
<P>
<STRONG>Program Highlights</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Competitive Rates</STRONG> - Because the policy is being
offered through individual
employers
to all their employees,
premiums are competitive with rates found outside such a program.<P>
<STRONG>Cash Accumulation</STRONG> - In addition to life
insurance protection, the policy 
provides increasing cash
value, which may be used for emergencies, retirement, college
education, or other financial
needs.<P>
<STRONG>Convenient Payments</STRONG> - There are no checks
for employees to write, and
nothing for
them to mail. Premiums
are deducted from their paychecks before they receive them.<P>
<STRONG>Easy Participation</STRONG> - Completion of a short,
simple application is usually
all
that's needed. Physical
exams are usually not necessary.<P>
<STRONG>Optional Family Coverage</STRONG> - An employee's
spouse, children, and even
grandchildren
may
be able to obtain
quality protection - even if the employee doesn't participate - upon
answering a few simple medical
questions.<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG> - Employees tailor their insurance
plan to meet their needs. 

<P>
We also offer a number of affordable options that allow
employees to
further enhance
their policy. Policy riders that waive the premium if employees become
unemployed or disabled are
available
at the point of sale. Should an employee become terminally ill, funds
from the policy may be
available during a
time of great financial need. A New York Life agent helps individual
employees design a plan that meets
their
specific objectives.<P>
<STRONG>Portability</STRONG> - Employees own their policy. If
they retire or leave their present
employer for
any reason, they  have
the right to continue the benefits of this policy. Several convenient
premium payment options
are even
available to satisfy their changing needs and/or new budget.
<P>
<STRONG>Common Questions</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Who is Eligible for a Policy?</STRONG><BR>
Any employee of a participating company, age 16-65, who has been
working full-time (30+ hours per
week) for at least six
months
may apply for coverage. In addition, eligible employees may also apply
for coverage for their
spouses
and children or grandchildren (ages 15 days to 25 years).<P>
<STRONG>Does This Replace Other Employer-Provided Group Life
Insurance?</STRONG><BR>
No, this individual life insurance supplements any existing insurance
that employees may have.
Unlike many
group life insurance programs, it isn't reduced or eliminated when
employees retire or leave the
company.<P>
<STRONG>When Does the Insurance Begin?</STRONG><BR>
Immediately. Once an employee signs the application and the Payroll
Deduction Authorization form,
insurance is
initially provided, under a temporary coverage agreement, until a
permanent policy is
issued.<P>
<STRONG>What Happens if an Employee Leaves the
Company?</STRONG><BR>
An employee who leaves the company is billed directly, in the manner
that is most convenient for him
or her. New York Life
provides him or her
with the flexibility to be billed on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or
annual basis. The
amount of 
premium will change to reflect the billing option chosen.<P>
<STRONG>How Does the Cash Value of the Policy
Grow?</STRONG><BR>
The policy has a guaranteed cash value that increases annually when
premiums are paid on
the due
date. Also, dividends, which are not guaranteed,
can add to
the policy's value.<P>
<STRONG>How Much Insurance Are Eligible Employees Entitled to
Purchase?</STRONG><BR>
Eligible employees may spend any amount from $15 a month to a
premium that will purchase a
maximum face
amount of $100,000. The policy must have a minimum face amount of
$5,000.<P>
<STRONG>Can Eligible Employees Purchase Additional Insurance at a
Later Date?</STRONG><BR>
An additional policy (providing more coverage) can be purchased
during the annual
re-enrollment
period, as long as the combined face amounts of the policies does not
exceed $100,000.
<P>
Participation in the payroll deduction life insurance program is
completely voluntary.
Since this
program is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA),
participating employers cannot contribute to or endorse any policy
offered under
this program.
