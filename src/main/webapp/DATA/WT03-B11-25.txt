Commentary: Religion as prophet to politics
RNS>17230

By A. James Rudin
Special to Religious News Service

   (Rabbi Rudin is national interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee.)

   (RNS) -- What in American life has historically played a key role
in shaping fundamental values of political leaders?
   Look for the answer in the early minutes of an upcoming television
program called "Democracy in America," an in-depth look at the lives
of Sen. Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Appearing briefly during the Markle Foundation-produced broadcast,
to be aired Oct. 11 on CNN, is the Missionary Baptist Church in
Carthage, Tenn., where Gore's spiritual life is rooted. It is the
church where his grandparents worshiped.
   And then, during a segment on Quayle, he says that "church on
Sunday" was a part of his upbringing in Huntington, Ind.
   These are but two examples of many in history that highlight the
strong influence of religion on our political process. It was an
aspect of the American scene that astonished French historical Alexis
de Tocqueville when he wrote a book called "Democracy in America" more
than a century ago.
   The connections have continued to amaze foreign visitors. The
United States is a highly industrialized First World country that
behaves religiously like a Third World nation. We have a legal barrier
between religion and government. Even though there is a legal
separation between religion and state, religion has been a critical,
often defining, factor in shaping the values of our political leaders.
   Throughout history, religious groups have stressed moral dimensions
of public issues, giving urgency and passion to politics. When leaders
sought independence from Great Britain, the cause was preached in
colonial pulpits.
   The abolitionist and pro-slavery movements were strongly supported
by religious leaders before the Civil War. And in this century, such
movements as prohibition, civil rights, sexual equality, the various
anti-war efforts and yes, family values, have all found a home in
church and synagogue.
   Religion's deep hold on the political imagination of most Americans
sets our country apart from others. High visibility at religious
services has traditionally been part of a U.S. president's job
description.
   Some consider the close ties a threat to the American republic. In
fact, they may be more a threat to religion. Many American political
leaders have abused religious symbols and language. And worse, they
have at times appropriated divine approval for ideology of their own
political parties.
   In the heat of a presidential election, it is important to remember
that God is neither a Republican nor a Democrat, not even an
independent.
   It is also important to recognize religion's proper functions in
society. One role, of course, is to develop permanent ethical values
in future leaders. Are the churches doing their job well? If Gore or
Quayle eventually becomes president, as five of our last nine vice
presidents have done, we may all learn the answer.
   But religion plays another important role in the political process:
to play the biblical prophet Nathan to King David, to be the
conscience of political leaders.
   Too often Jews and Christians have forgotten Nathan, who confronted
David with the seriousness of a moral lapse, and identified with the
dominant political values of society. Too often religion has been
deliberately manipulated by political leaders for their own ends.
   Writing 200 years ago, James Madison envisioned a robust role for
religion. He called for a "multiplicity of sects" in the public arena,
the better to achieve a balance between the compelling demands of
authentic religion and the complex political process.
   Each time we elect national leaders we are striking a new balance
for the future. It is an awesome but a necessary task.

Editor sues for wider access to Dead Sea Scrolls
RNS>17231

By David E. Anderson
Religious News Service
      (RNS) -- Herschel Shanks, the American editor who broke open a
fraternity of Dead Sea scholars to ensure wider access to the scrolls,
has gone to court to defend that access.
   Shanks, and the organization he heads, the Biblical Archaeology
Society, have filed suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
against Israeli professor Elisha Quimron. The suit, filed Sept. 25,
seeks a declaration from the court that a part of the Scrolls
reconstructed by Quimron cannot be copyrighted.
   Quimron, a professor of Hebrew Language at Ben-Gurion University in
Israel, is currently a scholar in residence at the Annenberg Research
Institute in Philadelphia.
   Some eight months ago, Quimron successfully sought a temporary
injunction barring the society from publishing or distributing
anywhere in the world the two-volume book "A Facsimile Edition of the
Dead Sea Scrolls."
   The book, which contains an introduction by Shanks, was the result
of years of labor by him and others to break the hold a small group of
scholars has held on the scrolls since they were discovered in 1947 in
a cave in what is now Israel. Shanks' effort was intended to make the
documents more available to other researchers and the public.
   The documents are believed to have been written between 200 years
before and 50 years after the birth of Jesus.
   The ancient texts represent one of the most important manuscript
discoveries in the field of early rabbinic Judaism and the first years
of the Christian movement. The originals are kept at the Rockefeller
Museum in Jerusalem and research on them is done under the auspices of
the Israeli Antiquities Authority.
   Since the 1950s, a small group of scholars, now numbering just 15,
has controlled exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls and less
than half have been published.
   Last year, the Biblical Archaeology Society published its two-
volume work containing more than 1,750 photographic plates. The book
made the text of the scrolls widely available to scholars, researchers
and other interested parties.
   Part of the volumes included a 120-line portion of the
reconstructed text of an ancient document known as MMT, an acronym for
the Hebrew phrase "Miqsat Ma'aseh ha-Torah."
   The MMT text is believed to a foundation document of the Qumran
sect, a Jewish group that broke with the prevailing rabbinic Judaism.
   Although the text, amounting to about 120 lines in Quimron's
reconstruction, is 2000 years old, the Israeli scholar, who is
preparing the reconstructed text for publication, says he owns the
copyright on it. Publication in the society's two-voume work is an
infringement of that copyright, he contends.
   Shanks said that the Israeli court's injunction, if allowed to
stand, "would have very broad implications for all scholarship."
   "It's probably the first time where a scholar has claimed such a
copyright on an ancient text," he said in an interview with Religious
News Service.
   Shanks went on to note that the reconstructed Hebrew transcript of
the text, as pubished in the facsimile, is already in wide
circulation.
   "Virtually all scholars have this text," he said. "Classes have
been taught on it. He (Quimron) authorized numerous articles" on it.
In 1990, a Polish journal, "The Qumran Chronicle," published a 120-
line text of MMT.
   In the complaint filed in Philadelphia, Shanks compared the
reconstruction of the MMT text to the completion of a jigsaw puzzle.
The complaint said that "much, if not all," of the work of
reconstructing MMT has been completed by scholars other than Quimron.
He became involved in preparing MMT for publication only in 1980,
according to Shanks.
   When the reconstructed text is made available for study by scholars
it is expected to shed a great deal of light on the Qumran sect,
including its beliefs, religious laws and practices and the then-
prevailing practices of Judaism.
   Shanks and the archaeology society are asking the court to declare
that publishing a portion of the MMT did not infringe any copyright in
violation of Quimron's rights.
   Quimron has until mid-October to reply to the complaint.

Q&A: Answers to questions about religion
RNS>17232

By Religious News Service

   (Editor's note: The following is a weekly feature from RNS. See
note at the end, which invites reader participation.)


Color it ?

Q: What is the significance of the colors of vestments worn by
Catholic priests and some Protestant ministers when they preside over
a worship service?

A: Violet or purple symbolizes penitence and is used during the
two major penitential seasons of the church's liturgical year. Those
are Advent, leading up to Christmas, and Lent, leading up to Easter.
   Rose, which symbolizes joy during a period of penance, is worn on a
specific Sundays during each of those seasons.
   Red symbolizes the suffering, or passion, of Jesus Christ on the
cross, and is worn for services that recall it. They include Passion
Sunday (also called Palm Sunday) and Good Friday. Red is also worn on
Pentecost, the major feast associated with the Holy Spirit, and for
celebrations of the feasts of apostles and martyrs.
   White, symbolizing purity, is worn for holidays associated with
Christ, such as Christmas and Easter; for feasts commemorating the
Virgin Mary or saints who are not martyrs. White may also be worn for
funerals.
   Green, symbolizing hope and vitality of faith, is worn for
"ordinary time," those Sundays that do not fall into other categories.
   Liturgical colors were standardized by the Council of Trent in the
16th century. Before that, the use of colors varied from place to
place.
   In efforts to set themselves apart from Catholics, most Protestants
abandoned use of color in services during the Reformation. But many
have begun using it again in recent times.


Biblical wings

Q: How many birds are mentioned in the Bible?

A: About 50, far fewer than the 350 species known to inhabit
biblical lands. Leviticus 11:19 alone mentions more than a dozen,
including the eagle, vulture, osprey, buzzard, raven, ostrich, hawk,
sea gull, owl, water hen, stork, heron and hoopoe. The list identifies
birds of prey that are to be avoided because they are considered
"unclean."
   Of these, the least well-known on the list, the hoopoe, is a 12-
inch-long bird with a long, curving beak and hawking call. It has a
cinnamon or buff-colored body and a high, gold crest tipped with
black. Its back and wings are marked with black and white bands.
   The hoopoe, common in Africa and Eruope, forages for insects and
worms in manure piles, which accounts for its being labeled unfit to
eat.

   Readers are invited to submit questions about religion or
religious practices to: Questions, Religious News Service, P.O. Box
1015, Radio City Station, New York, N.Y. 10101.

Archbishop Roach scolds newspaper for series
RNS>17233

By Willmar Thorkelson
RNS Correspondent
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (RNS) -- Archbishop John R. Roach of the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has denounced the St. Paul
Pioneer Press for publishing excerpts from a book dealing with priests
and the sexual abuse of children.
   Among other cases, the book, "Lead Us Not Into Temptation" by Jason
Berry, recounts how the archdiocese and another Minnesota diocese
assigned the Rev. Thomas Adamson, an accused pedophile, to various
parishes despite reports he had abused boys.
   In a guest column in the St. Paul newspaper on Thursday, Roach said
the Berry excerpts, published as a series, raise "serious questions
about fairness and good journalistic practice."
   The information about Adamson "was simply a rehash of matters that
have been public and published by you," he said, in what amounted to
an open letter to the newspaper.
   "Media throughout the country, including the Pioneer Press, and
professionals in the field of sexual abuse have recognized that the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has been a leader in
correcting what we have admitted were serious flaws in the way we
addressed pedophilia cases several years ago," Roach wrote. "We
operated from ignorance, and we have paid the price.
   "More importantly, we have learned, and we have been called upon by
interfaith groups and others all across the country to share our
policies," which were published in the Pioneer Press in 1988, he said.
   He continued: "Your knowledge of that and your failure to strike a
balance by noting it in connection with this series raises questions
about fairness, and perhaps indicates bias."
   Roach said he had "resisted vigorously" the notion that Catholics
are victims of a biased media. Howver, he said, "the decision to run
this series gives considerable credence to the theory of prejudice and
bias.
   "This archdiocese has been a vital part of this community from its
very beginning. We have been responsible citizens and have a long
history of successful service to the community. We have been here
longer than the Pioneer Press, and we will be here after the Pioneer
Press.
   "As you know, over the years we have had meetings with the editors
of your paper to discuss a variety of issues. We work hard to be
cooperative with the local media.
   "If your intent was to embarrass us, you've done it. But the way in
which you did it says more about you than about us."

Catholic leader targets entertainment industry
RNS>17234

By David E. Anderson
Religious News Service
      (RNS) -- Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese of Los
Angeles, issued an unprecedented pastoral letter to the entertainment
industry on Wednesday, telling artists they have a moral obligation to
uphold "human values" but rejecting any censorship or production code.
   "Because I reject censorship, I do not propose a code to govern
what filmmakers may create, nor do I wish to dictate what intelligent
viewers may see," Mahony wrote in the 40-page letter. It was timed to
mark the fifth anniversary of Pope John Paul II's meeting with leaders
of the movie, television and recording industries during his trip to
the United States in 1987.
   While saying filmmakers are "rightly jealous" of their creative
freedom, the cardinal added: "But a moment's reflection will convince
them that the freedom they cherish cannot be separated from the moral
order, the demands of truth, a concern for the common good or the
well-being of other people.
   "Such a separation would result not in freedom, but in license."
   Mahony said he wrote the letter because Los Angeles is the
entertainment capital of the world, an area where "a great proportion
of the world's entertainment is conceived, financed and produced."
   "But I also write for our Catholic community and for all people of
goodwill across the nation who are viewers of these efforts," he said.
   The letter comes in the midst of an intense campaign year debate
over "family values," a term Mahony avoided, using "human" instead,
and an on-going attack on Hollywood by Vice President Dan Quayle and
leaders of the Religious Right.
   Mahony, however, has rejected the more extreme of those views.
Earlier this year, he quickly disavowed a statement from the
archdiocesan office, which said that he would call for a tough new
film rating code. It was being proposed by the Atlanta-based Christian
Film and Television Commission.
   In preparing the letter, Mahony met with several leaders of the
industry. They included Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA Inc., parent of
Universal Pictures, as well as the heads of the Writers Guild of
America West and the Directors Guild of America.
   In the letter Mahony posed a series of guidelines filmmakers and
other entertainers should apply to themselves, including avoiding
sexist portrayals of women. He noted especially that the responsible
filmmaker's task is made difficult by the fact that so much of the
audience is made up of "young people who are not yet emotionally
mature."
   "Given the power of film, what might be a tasteful and realistic
portrayal of a significant human experience for a disciplined and
mature adult, can result, for sensitive and vulnerable young people,
in self-destructive, anti-social behavior," he said.
   "The Golden Rule applies here," he added. "Responsible filmmakers
will not do to their audience what they would not done to themselves
or to their own teen-age sons and daughters," he said.
   The letter was greeted by industry officials with relief and
praise.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, called the Mahony letter "wise and thoughtful." Danny
Goldberg, president of Atlantic Records and chairman of the American
Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, told the Los
Angeles Times he was "impressed" and "moved" by the letter.
   "It speaks to the kind of relationship that artists should have
with religion," he said.
   On religion, Mahony noted that the "overhelming majority of
American people believe in God and pray regularly. They look to God to
give meaning to their lives."
   The responsible filmmaker, he said, should ask, "Is the religious
dimension of the characters in their story in evidence. If not, why
not?"
   He also challenged filmmakers to upgrade their portrayal of women.
"Are they persons possessing the same intrinsic dignity as their male
counterparts and, at the deepest level, facing the same soul-wrenching
challenges to grow? ... Or is the impression given that they are
somehow something less, valued as objects rather than the persons they
are."
   In urging that "human values" be reflected, Mahony said such values
"are not the exclusive property of any one religious community, ethnic
group, educational level, economic class or political party."
   "To the filmmakers of our community, I say: Make films which
reflect these kinds of values and you actualize what is deepest,
richest and most creative within you. By doing so, you will give
something very special to your audiences. I can think of no better way
for you to say `thank you' for the superlative talents you have been
given by God."

Pastor resigns prominent Baptist pulpit
RNS>17235

By Jim Jones
Speical to Religious News Service
   DALLAS (RNS) -- A minister hired to be pastor of one of the largest
congregations in the Southern Baptist Convention resigned abruptly
Wednesday night, claiming the legendary senior pastor, the Rev. W.A.
Criswell, was reluctant to give up leadership.
   The Rev. Joel Gregory, named to succeed Criswell in November 1990
at 28,000-member First Baptist Church here, stunned members attending
a Wednesday prayer service when he read a resignation statement. In
the statement he charged that some church leaders were trying to
prolong Criswell's ministry at Gregory's expense.
   "The ultimate agenda," he said, "is in the prolongation of the
incumbent's ministry rather than enabling the new pastor's."
   Gregory, 44, said he considered his resignation to be irrevocable
and effective immediately.
   Gregory acknowledged that a short "transition period" had been
agreed upon when he accepted the prestigious post. At the time he was
hired, the arrangement was for Criswell to continue preaching at the
church's 11 a.m. Sunday service, while Gregory would preach at the
church's other three weekly services. Criswell, 82, was just the
second pastor of the church, founded in 1898.
   However, in the interview Gregory said he had recently learned that
some congregational leaders were expressing hopes that Criswell, a
former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, would remain as
senior pastor until his 50th anniversary at the church, still two
years away.
   "There was a verbal agreement that this was a short-term
transition," said Gregory. "I didn't anticipate it to be 20 months. I
certainly didn't anticipate it to be four years."
   Gregory, 44, said he had been told originally that Criswell would
step down as senior pastor after only a few months, possibly by the
spring of 1991.
   Gregory, a noted preacher in the 15-million-member denomination,
said, "The decision had elements of pain, but it also had elements of
integrity and rightness. I feel a verbal understanding among
Christians ought to be honored."
   Before accepting the pastorate, Gregory noted, he had been warned
by many fellow pastors that it would be impossible to be the true
pastor of First Baptist as long as Criswell remained in the pulpit.
   "I was told by many people, and, you know, they were right," said
Gregory.
   Asked about his plans, Gregory said, "I plan to rest and read. That
congregation is a huge burden, a day and night responsibility. I'll
rest awhile and see what opens up."
   Gregory said he had approached some congregational leaders about
the problem in recent weeks and was told he should bring his concerns
directly to Criswell.
   But in his statement he said he had decided that option would not
be appropriate.
   Despite the situation, Gregory said, he bears no animosity toward
Criswell, who was on the platform with Gregory when he made his
announcement.
   Criswell made no statement at the Wednesday service, and a
spokesman at First Baptist said Thursday afternoon that Criswell was
unavailable for comment on the matter.

   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)

   The Rev. Morris Chapman, president of the executive committee of
the Southern Baptist Convention, said he was aware of the struggles
within the Dallas church but had no idea they would result in a
resignation.
   "Things were not going real easily in the church," Chapman said
from executive committee headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. "It was just
a time of transition which was not going smoothly."
   "Dr. Criswell has given great leadership to the church over the
years," said Chapman. "Dr. Gregory is one of the premier preachers in
the Southern Baptist Convention."
   Up until 1990, Gregory had not been publicly identified with either
the denomination's moderate factions or its fundamentalists, who over
the past decade have come to dominate most of the denomination's
boards and commissions.
   But that year, when it seemed a moderate could be elected president
of the denomination, Gregory joined with several other prominent
pastors to endorse Chapman, the more conservative candidate.
   At that time, he said he hoped to "demonstrate that the
conservative resurgence in the convention is not simply a punitive
political plot to transfer power to one group" and said he hoped "to
be able to call all our people together who affirm the Bible as the
perfect work of God."
