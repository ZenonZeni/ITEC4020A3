<h3><b>PRE-EXISTING AND CONGENITAL CONDITIONS</H3></B>
<p>
Medicus particularly wishes to draw attention to the clause in its rules relating to Pre-existing and Congenital conditions. <P>
Medicus will cover Pre-existing conditions ( as defined, below ) provided that your child remains free of treatment, medication or advice for a period of two years from the commencement date of your Child Care Plan. If the condition recurs during this initial two year period, then the exclusion will continue until two years have elapsed since the last treatment, medication or advice for that condition. Congenital conditions are not covered under Medicus Child Care.
<p>
<br>
<i>A Pre – existing condition is a condition which is in existence at the commencement date (even if the condition has been misdiagnosed or if an inaccurate diagnosis has not been made by a qualified medical practitioner ) or for which you have received treatment, medication or advice on some previous occasions.</i>
<br>
<h3><b>PREFERRED HOSPITALS</H3></B>
<P>
Medicus administrators negotiate procedural price limits with leading Private Hospitals throughout the UK. These hospitals are selected on the basis of the high quality of their medical facilities, accommodation and their geographical suitability. A Medicus client will normally be within easy reach of a Preferred Hospital. This pricing co-operation form the hospital concerned greatly assists in controlling premium levels.
Under normal circumstances a client will attend one of these Preferred Hospitals but this will not be mandatory if the client has genuine medical reasons for needing to attend another hospital not on the list, providing that authorisation has been obtained from your counsellor. Apart from reducing premium levels, the use of Preferred Hospitals allows our client the benefit of direct billing and the assurance of quality accommodation and medical services. 
<br>
<i>The use of Preferred Hospitals ensures our clients receive both the highest levels of comfort associated with private care, together with access to specialised medical centres when medical circumstances make this necessary.</i>
