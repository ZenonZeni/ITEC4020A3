The department has several well-equipped research laboratories in this area: Laser Doppler Anemometry (Prof. I.G. 
Currie), Computational Fluid Dynamics (Prof. C.R. Ethier, Prof. M.F. Lightstone, and Prof. J. Mostaghimi), Turbulence 
Research Group (Prof. J.F. Keffer and Prof. P.E. Sullivan), and Environmental Fluid Dynamics (Prof. M.R. Loewen) .<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/baines.html"> <b> Professor W.D. Baines </b></a>
<br>
Mixing in Turbulent flows; Fundamental studies of 
pollutant mixing and dispersion in jets, plumes and 
thermals. Numerical and experimental studies of sheet 
formation in twin-wire paper machines.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/chandra.html"> <b> Professor S. Chandra </b></a>
<br>
Experimental studies on fluid flow during impact of liquid 
drops on a solid surface. Photographic analysis ofdroplets 
of water, hydrocarbon fuels, wax and molten tin 
impinging on solid substrates.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/currie.html"> <b> Professor I.G. Currie </b></a>
<br>
Experimental, numerical and analytical studies on flow-
induced vibrations in both single-phase and two-phase 
fluid flows. In the single-phase studies, applications 
include the aerodynamic stability of overhead power 
conductors as well as the stability of objects which are 
immersed in liquid or gas flows in general. The two-
phase studies have applications to heat exchangers and 
to boilers.<p> 

<a href="../../staff/profiles/ethier.html"> <b> Professor C.R. Ethier </b></a>
<br>
Research on computational fluid dynamics, fluid flow at 
low Reynolds numbers, the fluid mechanics of filtration, 
and visualization of unsteady flows: Advanced finite-
element simulation of 3-D incompressible flows; Flow 
visualization using the photochromic dye tracer 
technique: Flow through complex or inhomogeneous 
porous materials; Hydrodynamic properties of polymers 
in solution; and, Formation of mass transfer boundary 
layers during filtration.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/james.html"> <b> Professor D.F. James </b></a>
<br>
Research on the flow of complex fluids such as pulp 
suspensions, paints, synovial fluids, polymer melts and 
shampoos. Fundamental studies to understand the 
peculiar flow behaviour of these fluids. Development of 
instrumentation to characterize their fluid properties. 
Experimental and analytical research on fluid elasticity. 
Analysis of flow resistance in porous media. Statistical 
mechanics of polymers and particles in flowing fluids.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/keffer.html"> <b> Professor J.F. Keffer </b></a>
<br>
The experimental investigation of turbulent-flow 
phenomena through the use of hot wire anemometry 
and digital image analysis of flow visualization: (i) to gain 
a comprehensive understanding of the physics of 
turbulent flows, and (ii) to obtain quantitative 
information about structural features of these flows. <p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/lightstone.html"> <b> Professor M.F. Lightstone </b></a>
<br>
Interactions between solid particles and a turbulent flow: 
Modeling the effect of the gas-phase turbulence on the 
particle motion, developing techniques to reduce the 
computational effort required, and developing models to 
predict modulation of the gas-phase turbulence by the 
particles. Coolant mixing in nuclear reactors: 
Development of improved models to predict the 
complex flow within a fuel channel.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/loewen.html"> <b> Professor M.R. Loewen </b></a>
<br>
Acoustic remote sensing of breaking waves, air 
entrainment by breaking waves, energy dissipation in the 
upper ocean and air-water gas transfer.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/sullivan.html"> <b> Professor P.E. Sullivan </b></a>
<br>
The investigation of coherent structures on mixing and 
transport in turbulent flows, using both experimental and 
analytical techniques. The experimental work uses rakes 
of multiple hotwires, Laser Doppler Anemometry and 
Particle Image Velocimetry. Application to an engine to 
determine the influence of coherent structure on 
combustion, as well as a three-dimensional wall jet to 
determine the influence of structure on the anisotropic 
growth rate.<p>
