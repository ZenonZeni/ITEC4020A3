10001-2291.  28pp. </b></i><BR>
     This book attempts to dispel common myths associated with 
autism while providing practical, up-to-date suggestions and 
information for parents and practitioners working with autistic 
students.  The history and etiology of autism are explored, and 
problems of diagnosis are outlined. Considerations for teaching, 
management, and counseling of autistic students are included, and 
possible alternate treatments and cures for autism are described.<P>

<b><i>Amenta, C. A. III. (1992). Russell is extra special:  A book about 
autism for children. Brunner-Mazel Publishers, 19 Union Square, New 
York, NY 10003.  32pp. </b></i><BR>
     This portrayal of an autistic boy and his family is designed 
to help children (ages 4-8) and their parents understand this serious 
developmental disorder.  This book uses photographs to illustrate the 
boy's family life and daily activities.  Russell's mood swings, 
problems with learning, communication, behavior, sleeping, and social 
skills are detailed. <p>

<b><i>Berkell, Dianne E. (Ed.) (1992).  Autism: Identification, education, 
and treatment.  Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., 365 Broadway, 
Hillsdale, NJ 07642.  319pp. </b></i><BR>
     This collection of 12 papers is intended to provide an 
understanding of the autistic syndrome and information regarding 
effective diagnostic and treatment approaches.  Part I introduces the 
reader to autism by providing an overview of past and current 
philosophies and practices in the field.  Part II deals with 
intervention practices and strategies including approaches to 
assessment and instruction.  Part III addresses emerging trends in 
autism such as family involvement and services, early intervention, 
community integration, and supported employment.<p>

<b><i>Biklen, D. (1993). Communication unbound:  How facilitated 
communication is challenging traditional views of autism and 
ability/disability.  Teachers College Press, Columbia University, 1234
Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10027.  221pp.</b></i><BR>
     This book introduces "facilitated communication," a method of 
assisting people with autism to communicate by means of physical 
assistance in typewriting.  The book is organized around the author's 
own experience using the facilitated communication method, with 
examples of fieldwork using qualitative research to illustrate 
particular points and principals.  Experiences of care givers and 
parents are described, as they confront the controversies surrounding 
the use of facilitated communication and witness its successes and 
failures.<p>

<b><i>Davis, K. (1990).  Adapted physical education for students with 
autism. Charles C. Thomas, 2600 S. 1st St., Springfield, IL 
62794-9265.  126pp. </b></i><BR>

238 Main St., Suite 501, Cambridge, MA  02142.  208pp.</b></i><BR>
     The theory of autism presented in this book sees the key 
problem as an inability to integrate pieces of information into 
coherent wholes, and in so doing make sense of the mind's own 
activities, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.  The history of autism 
research is reviewed and key phenomena illustrated through case 
studies.<p>

<b><i>Groden, G., & Baron, G. M. (Eds.) (1991).  Autism:  Strategies for

children with autism and related disorders. Gardner Press, Inc., 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003.  244pp.</b></i><BR>
     This book offers a blueprint on how to bring about change in 
program planning and management as well as in clinical and educational
practice for individuals with autism.  The model that is presented 
emphasizes the importance of children and young adults learning 
procedures to manage their own behaviors instead of being externally 
controlled.  The model also emphasizes working intensively with 
families to enhance children's home behaviors and functioning.<p>

<b><i>Harris, S. L., & Handleman, J. S. (Eds.) (1994).  Preschool education 
programs for children with autism.  PRO-ED, 8700 Shoal Creek Blvd., 
Austin, TX 78757-6897.  252pp.</b></i><BR>
     Ten distinguished service providers from a variety of programs
for children with autism share detailed descriptions of their 
classrooms.  Some of the programs are in public schools, some are in 
private schools, and others in universities.  Each of the programs 
provides some opportunities for integration with normally developing 
or less impaired peers, and each includes parent training.  Each 
program emphasizes the importance of making appropriate plans for the 
child's movement to a different educational setting beyond the 
preschool years.<p>

<b><i>Harris, S. L. (1994). Siblings of children with autism:  A guide for

describing current theory and practice in treating and educating 
autistic children.  The neurological factors thought to cause autism 
are described, and key terms in discussing autism are defined.  The 
process of diagnosis is explored, and autism is differentiated from 
pervasive developmental delay.  Several chapters focus on autism as a 
communication disorder, recent research using facilitated 
communication, school placement, and special educational practices. <p>

changing pivotal behaviors of children with autism or other severe 
disabilities.  Behaviors specifically addressed for their far-ranging 
effects involve motivation and responsivity to multiple cues.  Seven 
instructional points are detailed with both good and poor 
implementation examples.  A partial workbook format encourages the 
reader to identify appropriate personal applications of each training 
technique.<p>

<b><i>Martin, R. (1994). Out of silence:  A journey into language. Henry 
Holt and Company, 115 W. 18th St., New York, NY 10011.  300pp.</b></i><BR>
     The book describes one family's experience raising a child who
became autistic at 18 months due to side effects of a vaccine.  The 
nature of an autistic child's relationship to language and vocabulary 
is discussed throughout the narrative, as is the neurological side of 
language acquisition.  The child's use of a keyboard by means of 
facilitated communication plays a major role in the narrative as a 
source of insight into his subjective experience of life with autism.<p>

behavior, aggression, and remediation through naturalistic language 
training, behavior modification methods, speech and language 
characteristics, and social skills training.<p>

<b><i>Powers, M. D. (1995). Educating children with autism:  A guide to 
selecting an appropriate program.  Woodbine House, 6510 Bells Mill 
Rd., Bethesda, MD 20817.   200pp.</b></i><BR>

delayed onset autism.  The family's efforts to cope with the diagnosis
of the child's condition are described, as is the family's determined 
9-year search through a wide variety of treatments and educational 
programs.  Experimental drug treatments, behavior modification 
programs, home schooling, vitamin and motivational therapy are all 
explored through the eyes of a father seeking possible solutions to 
his son's enigmatic disability.<p>

<b><i>Seifert, C. D. (1990).  Holistic interpretation of autism:  A 
theoretical framework.  University Press of America, 4720 Boston Way, 
Lanham, MD 20706.  75pp.</b></i><BR>
     The book presents a holistic approach to autism based on the 
premise that etiology comprises biological (genetic variation) and 
environmental (stress) factors.  The first chapter briefly considers 
etiology, behavior (biosocial, affective, cognitive, and 
affective-cognitive), and treatment.  The second chapter examines the 
psychodiagnostic use of human-figure drawing.  The third chapter 
presents a biosocial approach to personality assessment.  <p>

<b><i>Simons, J. M. (1987). The hidden child:  The Linwood method for 
reaching the autistic child.  Woodbine House, 6510 Bells Mill Rd., 
Bethesda, MD 20817.  255pp.</b></i><BR>
     The book describes the treatment approach used with autistic 
children at the Linwood Children's Center in Ellicott City, Maryland. 
Basic to the Linwood method are four tenets:  (1) the child is 
accepted in his totality; (2) the focus of treatment is on the health 
of the child; (3) all education is therapy, all therapy is education; 
(4) therapy is flexible.  The three treatment elements are 
observations, establishing relationships, and changing behaviors.  
Chapter topics include shaping behavior, limit setting, compulsions, 
language and thought processes, and social and emotional development. <p>
