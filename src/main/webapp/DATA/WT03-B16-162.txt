<blockquote>

<img src="../graphics/streetboys.gif" border=0 align=right valign=top><b>The lighter side of flooding</b>...water engulfed thousands of two-floor homes built along the dike holding back the Red River, causing residents to station themselves on their rooftops and guard their furniture. Curiously, the ensuing spirit was more festive than <b>disaster-struck</b>. Business opportunities: taxiing people and possessions from roof to road (tidy 18 cent turn-over) and entertainment for the water-logged. Movie houses reportedly enjoyed a 500% attendance increase, and that's for the French films.<p>

<b>So they decided to go into business together</b>...The second foreign coach hired by Vietnam's national soccer team is out the door, reported a Vietnamese sports paper, because he was frustrated with...the bureaucracy and red-tape. The last coach, a Brazilian, left after 44 days on the job and a week before the regional championships <b>German K. H. Weigang is at wit's end</b>.<p>

The problem, Weigang told the Vietnam News, is that "Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) is badly lacking a clearly defined chain of command." Each of three local assistants has his own coaching ideas, says Weigang, and his strategies don't go as far as he'd like. Weigang suggests that the team should be handed over to "one of my Vietnamese colleagues. <b>I'd like to emphasize 'one...,'</b>" he wrote in a formal letter to a VFF exec. His response? "Weigang is now ideologically stabilized so that he can concentrate on doing his duty."<p>
 
<b>What to do without EXIM Bank</b>...Why many Westerners seeking financing in Vietnam aren't ringing up Japanese trading houses is a mystery. Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and many others have been lending money to non-Japanese firms, as well as bidding for World Bank and ADB projects on behalf of clients, for a few years. Smaller traders, like Nichimen Corp., with a turnover last year of only $30 billion plus, will lend in exchange for a piece of the deal, e.g. supplying raw materials or machine parts. Some members of the local banking community are grumbling that the trading houses are <b>lending at rates that are too competitive</b>.<p>
 
<b>VBJ restaurant review #1</b>....Gotta hand it to the English language press in Hanoi for churning out those restaurant reviews. Eateries ranked using the star system? <b>Don't believe the hype</b>. One three-star Japanese restaurant serves teriyaki salmon baked, then baked again and again; sushi prices are fair -- for Tokyo; even the most edible burgers (available for $15 at one hotel, with fries) come with an <b>easy-over egg, no ketchup, and half an hour wait</b>;  the popular Indian place now delivers its mutton wrapped in plastic and tied with a string.<p>

For foreign food served in Hanoi, with a few exceptions, two rankings: <b>won't make you sick or will</b>. The good news is that the first category is growing. The smart move is to get a cook ($60 per month). Maybe the best idea is to acquire a passion for pho bo. <b>It is Vietnam, right</b>?<p>

<b>Trick to success -- do not part with more than $200 in total capital investment</b>...The nightclub scene in the nation's capital finally has a benchmark, now that the Roxy opened in August. Formerly a theater, this hip pit features space for a few hundred, including a dance floor on what was once the stage. Decor theme: black and white prints of those Vietnamese film-stars of yore, from the 50s and 60s. How's that for a walk down memory lane? <b>Bar-help serves up draft Tigers at a blistering pace</b>, usually too preoccupied slamming mugs to return change.<p>

Seating protocol: European back-packers and locals on the dance floor, Hanoi "old-hands" sitting at central tables looking shell-shocked, and at the bar, Americans looking for work. Well-known characters have been showing up to breath in Hanoi's new flashy side: take <b>IBM's Jeff Pace</b> on the dance floor, discovered dancing wildly to impress his wife, then throwing out his back and leaving.<p>
  
<b>Just don't pull that cork</b>...in the final six weeks of the <b>Floating Hotel's</b> HCMC life, local hotels wrangled for the Floater's permanent guests, using methods that were highly entertaining. The funniest battle for rubber-neckers was fought on the ad pages of local daily Vietnam News, before the Floater knew for sure it was history. Most prominent were half-page ads placed by the <b>Equatorial</b>: "It's sad to say, it's being towed away ... so call our special Floating Hotline." The Floater ran counter ads of its own, and even forced the News to pull the ads for a few days before ceasing to resist.<p>

<b>Listen to this funny honeymoon story</b>...just kidding. But congrats to <b>newlyweds Le Chi Dinh and Son Thanh Tran</b>, who recently feted an elegant Hanoi wedding. Anh Son now in the windy city for a DePaul University MBA. 100 years of happiness.<p>

<b>Comings and goings</b>...Hello to <b>Kim Sachsenmaier</b>, marketing manager of Apollo Education Centre....and <b>Mike Doyle</b>, hanging his hat at US Commercial Office in Hanoi...Farewell to <b>Omni Hotel's Rita Goh</b>, off to Sofitel Malaysia...<b>IBM's Steve Orman</b>, for Florida....<b>V-Trac's Paul Savage</b>, to Smith Barney, New York...<b>Tony Morgans</b>, for Standard Chartered's Singapore office...And after three years as <b>Motorola's</b> country manger and renown collector of Vietnamese paintings, <b>Frank Marciano</b> leaves for Singapore, replaced by Singapore paging manager <b>Wayne Bannon</b>.....and a quick hello and good-bye to recent vacationers to Vietnam, <b>Italy's President</b> and the <b>CEO of Compaq</b>, who stayed in separate rooms, of course, and to <b>Rabbis Reuven and Hirsch of Brooklyn</b>, who stopped in HCMC and Hanoi, here to advise a combined minion in Southeast Asia to "move to New York and find nice Jewish women."</b><p>
