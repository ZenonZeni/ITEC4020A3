</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>The International Manufacturing and Technology Show (IMTS) '96 will be held September 4-11, 1996, at McCormick Place, Chicago, Illinois...</B>
</CENTER>
<P>Manufacturing technology, including cleaning, pretreatment, mass finishing and environmental systems will be featured at the International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) September 4 - 11, 1996, at McCormick Place, Chicago.  

<P>IMTS '96 features some 1,300 exhibitors occupying more than 1.1 million sq ft of exhibit space. The show is sponsored and managed by AMT, The Association for Manufacturing Technology. The show has been held 
in various forms and locations since 1927. 

<P>Now eight days long, the biennial show converts McCormick Place into a factory of the future. The show features a pavilion theme where nearly one-third of the exhibit space is divided into product-specific areas, making it easier for attendees to find what they want to see. There are seven 
special pavilions at this year's show: Automation; EDM; Environmental, Safety and Plant Management; Forming and  Fabricating; Gear Generation; Lasers and Laser Systems; and Tooling, Tooling Systems and Workholding. 

<P>The Environmental, Safety and Plant Management pavilion is of special interest to finishers. It houses filtration and separation equipment; waste removal equipment; air purifiers; plant safety equipment; and maintenance equipment.  Other exhibits of interest to finishers include centrifugal barrel and disk and vibratory finishing equipment; mass-finishing media and compounds; paints, sealants and adhesives; robots; solvent and 
degreasing agents; parts washers and cleaning systems; chillers and heat exchangers; and inspection and measuring systems. 

<P>IMTS '94 attracted 115,018 registrants, among them 14,588 visitors from foreign countries. The average attendee is expected to spend two and a half full days in Chicago and spend close to $300 a day. 

<P>Manufacturing '96 is a special education event designed to complement this year's show. The conference features 70 one- and two-day courses and clinics, along with weekend tutorials. 

<P>IMTS '96 will be held in the North and East buildings at McCormick Place and will also use a large portion of the space in the new South building. If you are interested in finding out what IMTS offers finishers,  contact AMT at 
800-322-IMTS.
