"Melbourne is exceptionally competitive compared
to the rest of the world in the cost of office rentals, rates,
land, and
human resources"
</i>
</H3>
Merlin de R. Allan<br>
Managing Director<br>
Martin Dawes<br>
<P>
The quality, price and availability of services make Melbourne
an
attractive location for service providers and manufacturers.
All services are very competitively priced.
<p><hr>
<H2>Office accommodation</H2>
<P>
Well-located office and commercial space with all modern facilities
is available throughout Melbourne at competitive rentals, with
new
space always available.

<P>
In comparison with other locations in the region, office
accommodation
in Melbourne is of a high quality and extremely low cost.

<p>
<b><em>
The analysis shows, for example, that office rental costs in
Melbourne are less than a quarter of those in Singapore, almost
one-seventh of those in Hong Kong, and only 68% of Jakarta, and
71% of Kuala Lumpur.

<p>
Martin Dawes, a leading Europe-based telecommunications services
provider, has selected Melbourne as the site for its regional
headquarters.

<P>
For Martin Dawes, Melbourne has a distinct advantage in overheads.
According to Mr Allan, the City
"Is exceptionally competitive compared to the rest of the world
in the cost of office rentals, rates, land, and
human resources".

<P>
The company undertook a methodical analysis of all the potential
sites for its regional headquarters.

<P>
"Melbourne is at the hub of the Australian telecommunications
sector and strategically is in a first-class position to serve
as a springboard into Asia," Mr Allan said.

<P>
As well as its advantages in overheads, the other central reason
for choosing Melbourne is the city's ready supply of well-qualified
and service oriented staff.
