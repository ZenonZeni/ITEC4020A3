Aceves, Salvador M., and Smith, J. Raymond. <b>"A Hybrid Vehicle
Evaluation Code and Its Application to Vehicle Design."</b> Presented
at the most recent SAE International Congress.  This paper describes 
the vehicle simulation code that we wrote
to compare various components in a series hybrid vehicle. What
we did not say in the paper was that we were able to validate
this code using the GM Impact and Ford Ecostar electric car vehicle
parameters, which were kindly shared by their engineering staff.
The code is applied to a hydrogen hybrid automobile. UCRL-JC-117918

Bellan, J., and Harstad, K. 1996. <b>"Ignition of a Binary-Fuel
(Solvent-Solute) Cluster of Drops."</b> <I>Comb. Sci. and Techn.
</I>In press.  A model of the ignition of a binary-fuel cluster of drops 
is developed.
The results show that in the dense cluster regime, ignition is
controlled by the solvent, whereas in the dilute cluster regime,
ignition is controlled by the solute; these results are independent
of the ignition kinetics for independent identical kinetics. In
the intermediary regime, ignition is kinetically controlled. Also,
it is shown that the concept of volatility in sprays is directly
associated with the latent heat of the solvent in the dense regime
and with the boiling point of the solute in the dilute regime.

Bellan, J., and Harstad, K. 1995. <b>"Steady Injection of Identical
Clusters of Evaporating Drops Embedded in Jet Vortices."</b>
<I>Atomization and Sprays,</I> 5(1), 1-16.  A monodisperse 
spray is modeled as an injected sequence of identical
clusters of drops embedded into vortices.  The history of the travelling
cluster is determined by two competing characteristic times: that
associated with engulfment of surrounding gas into the expending
clusters and that associated with gas entrainment from the surroundings
into the injecting jet.

Sequences of Drop Clusters in Vortices Depicting Portions of a
Spray."</b> <I>Atomization and Sprays,</I> 5(1), 17-44.  
The shear layer at the edge and the core of a polydisperse spray
is modeled as injected sequences of clusters of drops embedded
into vortices, each cluster-in-vortex entity having different
initial characteristics.  Thus, the air/fuel mass ratio or the
drop size is varied in the sequence (increasing, decreasing or
sinusoidal) to create sprays with different atomization characteristics,
and an analysis of the results shows which injection patterns
are more beneficial to spray combustion.

<b>"Effects of Mismatch Losses in Photovoltaic Arrays."</b>
<I>Solar Energy,</I> Vol. 54, No. 3, pp. 165-171. March.  This

commercial modules is very small and does not explain common array
losses. Much more important, we found, was module overrating by

Harstad, K.; and Bellan, J. 1991. <b>"A Model of the Evaporation

1, 367-388.  Describes a model developed for the evaporation of 
interacting
and noninteracting binary-fuel drops in clusters depicting, respectively,

dense and dilute clusters. The binary fuel is composed of a small
quantity of solute that is much more volatile than the solvent,
therefore portraying alternate fuels. The results show that the
evaporation of drops in dense clusters is controlled by different
drivers than that of drops in dilute clusters.

5,250,427, issued Oct.5, 1993, describes a hybrid 
thermochemical/biological process for the photoconversion of organic 
materials into a biologically made, biodegradable thermoplastic. 
Gasification of dry organic materials convrts them into a synthetic gas 
(primarily CO and H<sub>2</sub>). Capable photosynthetic bacteria convert 
the CO into H<sub>2</sub>, which is then photoassimilated largely into 
polyhydroxyalkanoate thermoplastics. As the thermoplastics are natural 
products, they can be completely biodegraded by common aerobic or 
anaerobic bacteria. The U.S. market for single-use thermoplastics in 
packaging alone is more than 10<super>10</super> pounds and dollars per 
year.

for Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells."</b> In <I>Proceedings Volume
of the Eleventh Annual Battery Conference on Applications and

provided by Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFC)
for power generation (e.g., low operating temperatures and noncorrosive
and stable electrolyte), as well as advances in recent years in
lowering their cost and improving anode poisoning tolerance, are
stimulating interest in the system for stationary power applications.
While the large utility applications are envisioned as belonging
to the MCFC and SOFC, there are many applications such as utility
peak generation, demand-side-management, and dispersed power generation
for which the PAFC and PEFC are probably more attractive options.

layers for polymer electrolyte fuel
cells (PEFCs) consists of a thin film of highly intermixed ionomer
and catalyst that is applied to the electrolyte membrane.  The
discovery that the inclusion of large cations through a simple
ion-exchange process renders perfluorosulfonate ionomers moderately
melt-processable is exploited to significantly improve the structural
integrity of the catalyst layers. Various other aspects of endurance
testing and overall operation of such PEFCs are also discussed.
