<BR> Subject:      Wash. Post article on Clipper 2/5/94 <p>

Please post to "interesting People" mailing list if you deem appropriate. <p>

David - I am reading today's page one story on the Washington Post by
John Mintz &amp; John Schwartz entitled 'Clinton Backs Security Agencies
on Computer Eavesdropping'. Hopefully a full copy of this will make it
to the interesting-people mailing list. Getting this on the front page
is a good start though. I think the only way Clinton would back down
from this would be if there was an outcry from the public. But with
many people still not on the information highway yet and more concern
and interest with ice-skating scandals, I'm afraid it's not on the
front burner yet. The public needs to be educated on this before it's too
late. Certainly one wouldn't let anyone search their home without probable
cause and a warrant. Yet today much private data (eg credit histories,
medical histories etc.) gets in the hands legally of people should have
no business with it and I fear this may increase in the future. It's very
frightening but not as frightening as a populace that is uninformed. Now
to get back to the Post article. John - I'm wondering if you could
clarify something in the article. Let me quote a short paragraph: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      "Administration officials said that U.S. firms can buy powerful
      encryption equipment that does not contain the Clipper chip if
      they choose, but a White House statement said officials reserve
      the right to 'restrict access' to such technology in the future."

 <p>

Two key questions arise:

<OL>

<LI> Is there a date in the future after which all firms would be
mandated to buy the Clipper technology?

<LI> Would those firms who bought non-Clipper encryption devices be
allowed to keep them or be forced retroactively to adapt to
Clipper?</OL>
