<B>Modeling Biomass Pyrolysis for Hydrogen Production;<br>

Institute of Technology </a></B>

<P>

Hydrogen production from biomass is a technology for clean fuel 
production.  Biomass is 

readily available in most parts of the world, and hydrogen is an 
extremely clean and versatile 

fuel.  What remains to be demonstrated is efficient hydrogen production 
from biomass, and thus 

commercial attractiveness.

<P>

In collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), 
we are modeling 

biomass fast-pyrolysis reactors.  NREL provides, based upon experimental 
observations, the 

initial and boundary conditions for the calculations as well as the data 
for model validation.  Our rationale is that, whereas experiments can 
provide quantitative information about discrete regimes of operation, the 
numerical results from model-based calculations can provide a predictive 
tool to determine optimum regimes.  

<P>

We have developed a multilevel model of conservation equations 
describing injected clusters of 

spherical porous biomass particles that are followed on their 
trajectories as they slide on the 

helical reactor wall.  The inner-most level describes the behavior of a 
single particle immersed in 

hot gaseous surroundings, undergoing heating to produce char, tar and 
volatiles.  The tar further 

reacts to produce volatiles.  The particle model is based on the 
fundamental transient, 

spherically-symmetric conservation equations for mass, species, momentum 
and energy.  These 

account for gas species convection and diffusion through the particle 
voids, for heating by 

conduction and radiation, and for kinetic reactions.  The kinetic 
schemes are given by volumetric 

reactions and follow the reactions up to the production of the secondary 
vapor.  Interaction of 

the particle with the wall and with the turbulent boundary layer on the 
wall represent the next 

levels in the model.  Boundary conditions couple the different levels of 
the model.  Submodels 

for liquid scraping on the wall and for particle heating by the wall 
through the liquid film are part 

of the coupling.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>:

<P>

At NREL on 4/2/96, a JPL staff member presented our results,

and further conversations resulted in the decision that JPL will

try to correlate hemicellulose and wood kinetics from literature

data with NREL's help; NREL will make initial estimates of the

heats of reactions based on bond breaking and bond formation.

 We visited laboratories at NREL and were informed that the small

fluidized-bed reactor needed to be optimized.

<P>

A new wood kinetic scheme is being developed that incorporates

all the major facts about wood kinetics.  Among the three major

wood components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), lignin

produce the most char.  Among the three major wood components,

hemicellulose decomposes first; hemicellulose has a rate of reaction

about one order of magnitude larger than cellulose.  Lignin decomposes

over a much wider range of temperatures than cellulose and hemicellulose


but has the smallest rate of decomposition.  The information used

for correlation is from limited but relevant sources, so as to

leave enough capacity for further comparison with data not used

in the correlation; this is the only way to ensure that the kinetics

is representative and not merely a &quot;calibration.&quot;  The

new kinetic scheme will be tested against all relevant, known

experimental information.

<P>

We compared our new kinetics with kinetics in the literature and

with the data of Scott et al., and we compared our new kinetics for 
lignin

with data on lignin residual mass fraction.  Our work included

duplication of the residual weight versus temperature for different

heating rates from Koufopanos et al.  This is only kinetic information;

additional information on energetics will be used in the particle

model that has already been developed.
