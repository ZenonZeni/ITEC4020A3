<b>Introduction</b><p>
<p>

The explosion of telecommunications services has improved the ability for human
rights groups to disseminate information worldwide. New telephone, facsimile
and computer communications have created opportunities for human rights groups
to improve organizing and to promote human rights faster and at a lower cost
than ever before.  However, these new technologies can be monitored by
governments and other groups seeking to monitor the activities of human rights
advocates. For this reason, human rights advocates should be aware of  the
dangers and measures that can be taken to limit surveillance.<p>
	The scope of this paper is limited to the interception of oral and electronic
communications commonly referred to as wiretapping and other issues related to
telephone communications. It will also discuss methods to avoid surveillance.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a><p>
 <p>
<b>Why Should Groups be Concerned?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Wiretapping is conducted in nearly every country in the world and is
frequently abused. The US Department of State, in its annual <i>Country Reports
on Human Rights Practices for 1994</i>, reports widespread, illegal or
uncontrolled use of wiretaps by both government and private groups in over 70
countries.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a>  Human rights groups, reporters
and political opponents are the most common targets of surveillance by
government intelligence and law enforcement agencies and other non-governmental
groups. In some countries, such as Honduras and Paraguay, the state owned
telecommunications companies were active participants in helping the security
services monitor human rights advocates.  In other countries, multiple forms of
surveillance are used. For example, in 1991, wiretaps and hidden microphones
were found in the offices of the Mexican Human Rights Commission.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a> More recent press reports estimated that there are
200,000 illegal wiretaps in Mexico currently in place.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[4]</a> <p>
	 	These problems are not limited to developing countries.  In the US,
litigation conducted by the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the FBI monitored computer
networks used by political and advocacy groups.  French counter-intelligence
agents wiretapped the telephones of prominent journalists and opposition party
leaders during the mid-1980s. There have been numerous cases in the United
Kingdom which revealed that the British intelligence services monitor social
activists, labor unions, and civil liberties groups.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[5]</a> <p>
	Thus, there is an obvious need for human rights groups to be concerned with
wiretapping: Governments often monitor human rights groups to discover what
they know, who their sources are, and what their future activities will be.
The lack of secure communications creates the threat of physical harm to many
people in the human rights field.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Who Can Do it and What are the Limitations?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Most types of electronic communication can be intercepted without a high level
of expertise or  expensive equipment.  Surveillance equipment is not difficult
to construct and is available in many electronics stores. Many manufacturers
sell surveillance devices to any buyer, without restrictions.  Thus, groups
should be aware that both governments and private organizations may have the
capability to eavesdrop.<p>
	This does not mean that everyone should believe that they are always under
surveillance.   It is not practical for any government or group to wiretap all
telephones in a country and listen to every conversation simultaneously.
Wiretapping is a labor intensive operation and requires considerable resources
to conduct the taps, listen to, and transcribe the conversations. Because it is
necessary to have a human listen to the conversation, labor and equipment costs
create practical limits to surveillance. The East German secret police employed
10,000 people to conduct wiretaps and listen to conversations before the Berlin
Wall fell.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[6]</a> <p>
	New technologies, such as computerized voice recognition, that can automate
surveillance are being actively developed by Western (and presumably also by
other) governments. The <i>Ottawa Citizen </i>reported that the Canadian
Communications Security Establishment has spent over $1.1 million to "isolate
key words and phrases from the millions of signals the CSE monitors every day"
and  awarded contacts to develop systems to create a "speaker identification
system."<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[7]</a> There were also reports that the
US Government assisted the Columbian government in tracking down drug cartel
leaders by using voice recognition technologies on cellular phone calls. These
new technologies are not yet generally available to less wealthy countries or
local police forces.  	There may also be technical limitations on conducting a
large number of simultaneous taps.  Recently, former members of the Soviet KGB
disclosed that they only had the capability of wiretapping 1,000 phone lines in
Moscow and another 1,500 for the rest of Russia.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[8]</a> <p>
	Given this, it is not likely that every telephone can be monitored in a
particular city. However, it is possible that the public and private phones
nearest to the offices of human rights organizations or their staffs may be
also monitored.  In France, counter-intelligence officers illegally wiretapped
not only the telephones of several journalists but also the phones in bars and
restaurants that they frequented.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[9]</a><p>
   Thus, surveillance is generally limited to those wiretaps installed manually
and listened to by human agents. This is not an inconsequential threat. <p>
<p>
<b>Standard Telephones</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Standard telephone systems are very vulnerable to wiretaps. It does not
require a high level of skill or technology to intercept a voice communication.
There are many locations where a wiretap can be placed. For example,
microphones in many older telephones' handsets can be replaced with one that
can also transmit to a remote receiver.  Taps can also be placed at the
telephone boxes in the basements of buildings, on the lines outside the house,
or on the telephone pole junction boxes near the target of the surveillance. A
common technique used by police forces is to remotely monitor calls by having
lines run from a telephone company central office where the local switching
equipment is located to a monitoring station in a government office. <p>
	Many of these techniques are undetectable to the target, especially in newer
systems, where the system is run by computers.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[10]</a> In the US, legislation requiring that all
communications systems be designed with the ability to more easily intercept
communications was recently enacted at the behest of the law enforcement and
intelligence community. <a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[11]</a>This will have a
profound effect worldwide since the US is one of the largest manufacturers and
purchasers of telephone switching equipment worldwide.<p>
<p>
<b>Scrambling Voice Communications</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Technology is available to ensure that telephone conversations are not easily
monitored.  Secure phones, which use cryptography, a mathematical technique for
scrambling conversations, are commercially available from many different
companies including Motorola, TRW and AT&amp;T, but these devices may not
provide adequate protection. AT&amp;T recently introduced an telephone
attachment that connects to the handset cord and when used with a duplicate
device on the receiving device, scrambles conversations.  However, it uses a
specialized computer chip, known as the Clipper Chip,  for which the keys to
unscramble communications are also held the US Government in a system called
"key escrow."<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[12]</a> The U.S. Government has
been strongly pushing other governments to adopt the system for their
countries. If other countries also begin using similar systems, it is likely
that keys for users in that country will also reside with their governments.<p>
	Other devices use the US Data Encryption Standard (DES) or secret company
standards.  DES is considered by most security experts to be secure against
eavesdropping except against the most well financed opposition such as large
intelligence organizations.  Secret  standards may not be as secure because
they may have weaknesses that have not been publicly disclosed since there is
no open review of the algorithms. These devices are also very expensive,
costing around $US 2,000 each.<p>
	There is also the possibility that the devices are deliberately not secure.
The United State and some other countries have laws that require government
permission to use or export any device or software that contains encryption.
In the US, manufacturers are required to design their products that will be
exported so that the NSA may still monitor the conversations. Therefore, any
device that is sold by a US company overseas should not be considered safe for
protecting sensitive information.<p>
	These controls may be circumvented by purchasing devices designed in countries
such as Sweden or Switzerland, which do not have export control laws on
encryption.  However, these devices may have also been compromised by their
domestic intelligence agencies. Recently, there were numerous news reports
across Europe that Crypto AG, a company which sells secure phone and fax
devices, is in reality controlled by German intelligence and has deliberately
sold weakened encryption devices. There are also international information
sharing agreements -- such as the Quadripartite Agreement -- between
intelligence agencies that could result in the weakening of encryption.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[13]</a><p>
	A recent advance is the development of computer based scrambling that will
allow two PC (or clone) owners to talk to each other through their computers
over modems or the Internet to scramble their conversations. Several freely
available programs are currently under development.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[14]</a> These programs are generally available for free and
may be ideal for human rights groups to use. However, they may also require
more powerful computers to use (at least a 386 or faster machine for the PC,
68030 or greater for the Mac) and high speed modems (14.4K or faster) to have
understandable speech.<p>
<p>
<b>Wireless Communications</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Wireless telephones are becoming more and more popular in western countries.
In the US alone, over 40 million cordless phones are in use. There are also
millions of cellular telephones in use. In developing countries, wireless
communications such as cellular and satellite-based telephones are also popular
as a means to avoid laying new telephone lines in areas that were previously
undeveloped. All of these devices are easily interceptable and should not be
used by anyone who is discussing sensitive information.	<p>
	Cordless telephone communications are especially easy to intercept.  Many of
the older models broadcast just above the top range of the AM radio band and
conversations can be easily overheard with any AM radio. Newer models operate
in the 49 MHz range and can be intercepted with an inexpensive radio scanner
purchased at most electronics stores for under $US 100.00. The range of
interception can extend to nearly one mile.<p>
	 Several phone manufacturers now offer "privacy secure" cordless phones that
they claim ensure the privacy of phone calls. However, most of these phone use
a simple fifty year old technique known as  "frequency inversion"  that inverts
the sound waves to limit eavesdropping.  This system provides minimal security
at best.<p>
	New digital-based cordless phones may provide a slightly greater level of
protection from the common listener, but most of these phones lack any form of
sophisticated scrambling that would protect eavesdropping by government
agencies or wealthy opponents. In addition, it is likely that new scanners will
soon be available commercially that will be able to listen in on these
conversations.<p>
	Cellular phones have the same problems as cordless. They also broadcast over
airwaves like a radio.  Inexpensive scanners are also available to intercept
conversations. A US law requires that newer scanners limit eavesdropping on
certain frequencies but kits are readily available from electronic stores and
mail order companies to remove those protections.  In addition, some cellular
phones can be programmed to act as scanners to intercept other calls. There is
also equipment available to law enforcement, which can track and monitor
cellular conversations as they move around a city.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[15]</a><p>
	New cellular phones use a digital system which will be more difficult to
intercept and also provide for clearer conversations.  It is also easier to
secure these telephones from eavesdropping.  However, intelligence agencies in
the United States and other countries have attempted to restrict the use of
improved scrambling technology. In Pakistan, the government shut down the
cellular phone company until it provided equipment to allow easy over-the
air-interception.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[16]</a> In the US, the cellular
telephone industry association agreed to adopt a weakened scrambling standard
after pressure from the National Security Agency. Experts who have seen the
standard state that the standard provides little or no protection against
eavesdropping. Intelligence agencies in other countries have also lobbied to
limit the security features in GSM - the international standard for digital
cellular phones. In Australia, the federal government rejected the request of
the law enforcement agencies and ordered the operator of a new digital cellular
system to commence operation without the capability to intercept the over the
air portion of the conversation.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn1">[17]</a><p>
	Cellular phones can also provide information on the location of an individual
to within a few blocks, depending on the system. When a cellular telephone is
turned on, it regularly broadcasts its location to the local transmitters so
that they can direct calls to the correct location. This information can be
used to locate the position of a cellular phone and may also be used to track
its location its owner moves around.<p>
	A related technology, the wireless pager, can also be easily intercepted.
Pagers receive signals over the airways with no scrambling. Numerous programs
are available for computers that can monitor the entire frequency spectrum that
pagers operate on and automatically retain every message that is sent.<p>
<p>
<b>Facsimile (fax) Machines</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	It is also possible to intercept facsimile transmissions.  A fax machine is
essentially an inexpensive computer system that uses a well known standard for
sending and receiving files.  Most experts describe intercepting faxes as "very
easy."<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[18]</a> Commercial devices are widely
available that automatically intercept faxes. In New York City, fax intercept
machines were used as far back as 1990 by local police. <a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[19]</a> <i>Defense News </i>reports that numerous countries
sell these devices including the United States, the UK, the Czech Republic, and
Israel and that the "many countries are eyeing low-cost systems...also to
intercept political and economic-related information...." It is also possible
to intercept faxes using a computer with specialized software and a fax modem.
With the widespread use of Digital Audio Tape (DAT), it may also become easier
to record a fax transmission and replay it back into a machine with minimum
effort.  Thus, fax machines should be considered as insecure as telephones.<p>
	There are also fax machines available that provide scrambling to prevent
interception.  These machines usually cost around $US 3,000 and are available
worldwide.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[20]</a>  Like secure telephones, fax
machines from the United States must have a weakened encryption scheme to allow
for their export.  Companies in Sweden, Switzerland, and other European
countries claim their machines are not limited because they have no export
laws.  An expert on encryption should be consulted before purchasing these
devices to ensure their security.<p>
	It may also be illegal to use such devices.  It has been reported that some
countries, such as Singapore and China limit the use of encryption without
providing the keys to the government.  In China, the use of fax machines
without a license is prohibited.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Telephone Transaction Information</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Another area of concern is the transactional information created when a
telephone call is placed. <p>
In most countries, when a call is placed, the number of the called party is
recorded in the telephone company's computers. This can provide critical
information on confidential sources and others. In the US, these records are
widely used by law enforcement against reporters to locate leaks of
information, and monitor environmentalists and others.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[21]</a><b> </b>In the former USSR, human rights activist
Anatole Sharansky reported that the authorities regularly obtained his overseas
billing records to keep track of  who he had spoken to.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[22]</a><b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Computer Communications</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Computer based communications is the newest and most useful tool for human
rights advocates.  It provides fast and inexpensive communications to nearly
every country in the world. Electronic mail can be used quite effectively to
communicate and distribute information worldwide at low cost. It  is also
possible to create private mailing lists or post information on public
electronic conferences such as Peacenet or the USENET newsgroups. <p>
	Eavesdropping of computer communications is not difficult unless measures are
taken to increase security. High speed modem communications (14.4K, 28.8k) are
more technically difficult but can still be intercepted by law enforcement in
the US. Low speed modem communications (1200,2400) are fairly easy to
intercept.<p>
	Once connected to an international network like Internet, new problems arise.
Messages pass through numerous machines on the way to their destination.
Currently, sending electronic mail is the equivalent of sending a typewritten
postcard in the mail. It theoretically can be read by anyone in the computer
link between the author and the recipient and there is also no method to
conclusively verify the identity of the message originator.<p>
	Encryption can also be used to protect these communications. Many human rights
groups are already encrypting their messages. Groups in Central America,
Ethiopia and Burma use encryption to protect their communications and files.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[23]</a> It was also reported that the African
National Congress developed and used an encrypted e-mail network for years
without it being compromised by the security services of South Africa.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[24]</a><p>
	Encryption can be used to protect the messages and to verify the identity of
the sending party. Unlike other communications technologies, encryption for
computers is widely available for free or at minimal cost.  It is also easy to
use.  Many commercial software packages such as Lotus Notes and the planned
future versions of the Microsoft and Apple Computer operating systems will have
built-in encryption, although the encryption in these products have been
weakened to allow for export.  <p>
	Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn3">[25]</a> by Phil
Zimmermann, an American software engineer and human rights activist is commonly
used by human rights groups worldwide. It is available for most  computers<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn3">[26]</a> and can be easily configured to work in
several different languages, including Spanish, French and German.  The program
is small and can work on nearly all laptop and personal computers, along with
larger systems.<p>
	PGP uses "public key" encryption.  Each user of PGP creates two keys, a public
key and a secret key.  The user then gives the public key to whomever they wish
to correspond with and can even publish it publicly like a phone number. The
secret key is kept in a safe place -usually with the PGP program -  and
protected by a password.  The public key is used by other people to encrypt
messages that they send to the secret key holder and only that person can
unscramble the messages. Thus, public key cryptography avoids the need to meet
in person or to carry codebooks to safely exchange keys and messages.<p>
	To use PGP, a person writes out a message using a word processor, runs PGP to
scramble the message with the recipient's key, then sends the scrambled file as
a mail message instead of the original message.  The receiver runs PGP to
covert it back to a readable form.  The process only takes an additional minute
or two, depending on the length of the message and the processor speed of the
computer.  For some computer systems, programs have been written to make it an
automatic function of electronic mail.<p>
	Another feature that PGP and other public key systems can provide is "Digital
Signatures," which ensure the identity of the sender of the message in the same
way that a normal signature at the bottom of a letter usually verifies that a
letter is from a known corespondent.  Signatures are useful when an electronic
message is sent to ensure that it was not modified or falsely created by
someone else.  Thus, readers of notices from groups which send  out electronic
alerts, such as Amnesty International, Americas Watch, Helsinki Watch and the
Tibetan Government-in Exile, can ensure that the alerts have not been altered
by people wishing to disrupt the group's activities. <p>
	PGP can also be used to protect files on a computer. It can prevent the
accessing of  electronically stored papers or correspondence in case there is a
physical break-in and the computer is taken. Many groups in Central America use
it to protect their databases of rights abuses. <p>
 	Another useful program to ensure that IBM PC computers are not accessible
without a password is Secure File System (SFS) by Peter Gutman. SFS is a
program which sits between the disk drive and the operating system,
transparently encrypting all data as it is written to disk and decrypting it
again as it is read from disk.  To the user, it appears - apart from a slight
slowdown due to the encryption - as a normal disk drive. In order to access an
encrypted drive, it must be first mounted by entering the decryption password.
The drive can later be unmounted with a user-defined key combination, after a
period of inactivity, or when the machine is reset or turned off.<p>
	Encrypted disks can be converted back to normal disks, or have their contents
quickly and efficiently destroyed.  The software includes various stealth
features to minimize the possibility of other programs monitoring or altering
its operation. <p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	New technologies offer new opportunities for human rights advocates.
These same technologies also present opportunities for enhanced eavesdropping
by those opposed to the groups' activities.  <p>
	Wiretapping of human rights groups is not uncommon. However,  there are
limits, both technical and labor related, to the number of taps that are in
effect at one time. It is impracticable for every phone in a city to be
monitored simultaneously. Nonetheless, human rights organizations may want to
take precautions. There are methods available to prevent eavesdropping and care
must be taken to ensure that the devices purchased actually provide an adequate
level of protection.<p>
