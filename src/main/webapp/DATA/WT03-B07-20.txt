SEC Proposes New Disclosures
About Derivatives

The SEC has proposed for comment amendments to require disclosure
of the accounting policies used for derivatives (Rel. Nos. 33-7250,
34-36643, IC-21625, December 28, 1995).  Comment also is sought on
proposed amendments to require qualitative and quantitative
disclosure outside the financial statements about the market risk
associated with derivatives.

The SEC conducted a review of about 500 registrants in 1994 and
1995 to assess disclosure practices with respect to market risk
sensitive instruments.  The disclosures reviewed in 1995 were more
informative than 1994, largely due to improved guidance by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the staff concluded.
However, three significant disclosure issues remain.   The release
addresses those issues.

The proposed amendments would require enhanced descriptions in the
footnotes to financial statements of accounting policies used for
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments.  The materiality of such disclosure would be
determined by the fair values of the instruments at the end of each
reporting period and during each reporting period.

The SEC proposed a new Item 305 under Regulation S-K to require
disclosure outside the financial statements of qualitative and
quantitative information about derivatives and other financial
instruments.  In complying with the proposed amendments requiring
disclosure of quantitative information about market risk,
registrants could select from three alternatives.  One option is to
use a tabular presentation of expected future cash flow amounts and
related contract terms categorized by expected maturity dates.

A second option is to use a sensitivity analysis expressing the
possible loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market
risk sensitive instruments from selected hypothetical changes in
market rates and prices.  The final option is to use value at risk
disclosures expressing the potential loss in earnings, fair values,
or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from market
movements over a selected period of time with a selected likelihood
of occurrence.

The proposed qualitative information about market risk would
include a narrative discussion of primary market risk exposures and
how they are managed.  Registrants are reminded to include
information about derivatives that directly or indirectly affect
reported items to the extent such information is material and
necessary to prevent the disclosure about a reported item from
being misleading.

The SEC reported its intention that forward looking disclosures
under new Item 305 and Item 9A of Form 20-F be subject to an
appropriate safe harbor.  The staff is considering how to craft an
appropriate safe harbor in light of the recently passed Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act.  The Act amends the 1933 and 1934
Acts to include a safe harbor for forward looking information.  The
SEC will issue a release in the near future to propose that dis-
closures to be required by Items 305 and 9A be made subject to safe
harbor provisions.

The SEC noted that it recognizes the evolving nature of market risk
sensitive instruments and will continue to monitor disclosure
related issues.  If the proposals are adopted, the SEC expects to
reconsider the effectiveness of the rules and the need for
additional proposals in about five years.  The comment period for
the proposed amendments is 120 days.

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS

JAMES MCCURRY, FORMER COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND OPERATIONS MANAGER
OF BIEDENHARN INVESTMENT GROUP, INC., BARRED

On December 29 the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against James McCurry (McCurry), formerly the compliance officer
and operations manager of Biedenharn Investment Group, Inc.
(Biedenharn), a now defunct broker-dealer formerly registered
with the Commission.  McCurry consented to the entry of the
Order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings,
except the entry of a permanent injunction against him which was
admitted.

The Order makes findings that McCurry participated in the offer
and sale to investors of over $36 million of note securities
issued by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial
Corporation (Towers) by means of a general public solicitation
through mailings of form letters, which made materially
misleading statements to investors concerning the relative
safety of an investment in Towers notes; the risks associated
with the investment; the ratings on the securities offered by
Towers; and the collateralization for and/or insurance for the
Towers obligations.  The Order makes further findings that
McCurry was permanently enjoined by consent in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (Shreveport
Division, SEC v. James McCurry and William E. Powdrill, III)
from violations of the securities registration and antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
offer and sale of note securities offered and issued by Towers.
The Order bars McCurry from association with any broker, dealer,
investment adviser, investment company or municipal securities
dealer.  (Rel. 34-36654)

WILLIAM POWDRILL, FORMER REGISTERED SALES REPRESENTATIVE OF
BIEDENHARN INVESTMENT GROUP, INC., BARRED

On December 29 the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against William E.  Powdrill, III (Powdrill), formerly a
registered sales representative of Biedenharn Investment Group,
Inc. (Biedenharn), a now defunct broker-dealer formerly
registered with the Commission.  Powdrill consented to the entry
of the Order without admitting or denying the Commission's
findings, except the entry of a permanent injunction against him
which was admitted.

The Order makes findings that McCurry participated in the offer
and sale to investors of over $36 million of note securities
issued by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial
Corporation (Towers) by means of a general public solicitation
through mailings of form letters, which made materially
misleading statements to investors concerning the relative
safety of an investment in Towers notes; the risks associated
with the investment; the ratings on the securities offered by
Towers; and the collateralization for and/or insurance for the
Towers obligations.  The Order makes further findings that
McCurry was permanently enjoined by consent in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (Shreveport
Division, SEC v. James McCurry and William E. Powdrill, III)
from violations of the securities registration and antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
offer and sale of note securities offered and issued by Towers.
The Order bars Powdrill from association with any broker,
dealer, investment adviser, investment company or municipal
securities dealer.  (Rel. 34-36655)

EDWARD DUFFY AND MICHAEL KARP SANCTIONED FOR ROLES IN SARIVOLA
FRAUD

The Commission announced the institution and settlement of
administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Rules
of practice against Edward F. Duffy and Michael N. Karp.  Duffy
and Karp were previously named as defendants in SEC v. Anthony
Sarivola, et al., a civil injunctive action filed by the
Commission on October 31, 1995 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York.  The Commission's complaint
alleged that Duffy and Karp participated in a fraudulent scheme
masterminded by Anthony Sarivola while they served as counsel
for and directors of certain companies controlled by Sarivola.
On November 17, 1995, the court permanently enjoined Duffy and
Karp, on consent, from future violations of certain antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws.

Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Duffy
consented to be permanently denied the privilege of appearing or
practicing before the Commission, and Karp consented to be
denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission with a right to apply to resume appearing or
practicing after two years.  (Rel. 34-36664)

FINAL JUDGMENT OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED AGAINST JAMES
MCCURRY AND WILLIAM POWDRILL

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the entry
of Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction on December 19, 1995
in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana
against James McCurry (McCurry) and William E. Powdrill, III
(Powdrill) which permanently enjoined Powdrill and McCurry from
violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the
federal securities laws.  Based upon the defendants' inability
to pay, disgorgement and prejudgment interest was waived as to
Powdrill and civil penalties were not imposed against either
defendant.  McCurry and Powdrill consented to the entry of the
Final Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in
the Commission's complaint.

The Commission alleged that McCurry and Powdrill violated the
antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal
securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, from
at least April 1988 until September 1992, McCurry and Powdrill
raised $12.8 million through the offer and sale of notes issued
by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial Corporation
(Towers), of which $5.2 million subsequently defaulted.  The
Commission also alleged that McCurry and Powdrill misrepresented
the safety of the notes, which were speculative and subject to
numerous risks and that they falsely claimed that certain of the
notes were covered by insurance or were fully collateralized.

In a related action on February 8, 1993, the Commission filed a
civil action against Towers and certain of its principals
alleging antifraud and registration violations of the federal
securities laws.  See LR-13514.  [SEC v. James McCurry and
William E. Powdrill, III, USDC/WD, LA/Shreveport Div, Civil
Action No. CA-95-0552-S] (LR-14768)

The Commission announced today that the Honorable John G. Koeltl
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York signed a final judgment against defendant David P.
Schwartz permanently enjoining him from future violations of
Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
14e-3 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $3,063.83 in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $14,833.00 as a civil
penalty under the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud
Enforcement Act of 1988.  The judgment was entered on December
14, 1995.  Defendant Schwartz consented to the entry of the
final judgment without admitting of denying the allegations in
the complaint.

In this action the Commission alleges that on November 9, 1989,
while in possession of material, nonpublic information relating
to the tender offer for DeSoto, Inc. announced later that day,
defendant Schwartz, at the time an employee of Morgan Stanley &
Co. Inc., tipped defendant Edward A. Cantor, who then purchased
35,000 shares of DeSoto, Inc. for a total cost of about
$1,443,750.  Defendant Cantor previously settled with the
Commission without admitting or denying the allegations.

Disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid by defendants Cantor
and Schwartz is being held by the Court for the benefit of
persons who submit valid claims within one year after the date
of entry of the final judgments.  The Commission intends to
petition the Court to appoint a special claims master to develop
a distribution plan.  The litigation is pending against
defendant Michael Levine.  For further information, see LR-14329
(November 9, 1994) and LR-14678 (October 4, 1995).  [SEC v.
Cantor, et al., 94 Civ. 8079,JGK, U.S.D.C. S.D.N.Y.  filed
November 8, 1994] (LR-14769)
