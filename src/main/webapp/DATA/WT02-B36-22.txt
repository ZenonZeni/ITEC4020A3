WEST AFRICAN DEEP WATER DRILLING SET TO TAKE OFF END YEAR

A new market for high specification semi-submersibles opens up in deep
water off West Africa at the end of this year.  Suitable drilling units
will need to be brought in from outside the region to cope with water
depths varying from 2,500 to over 4,000 feet.

Co-operation is likely between the operators planning to drill during
1995/6 to reduce mobilisation costs and avoid undue competition within
the small worldwide pool of suitable rigs.  This will probably limit
the number of deep water rigs required offshore Nigeria to two - one an
upgraded third generation or standard fourth generation unit operating
in intermediate water depths of around 2,500 ft, and the other a
specialist deep water rig capable of drilling in 4,000 ft or more.

There are also deep water drilling programmes planned elsewhere
offshore West Africa, notably in Angola, but also in Congo, Gabon
Equatorial Guinea and potentially Namibia.  These could provide
continuing employment for one other deep water unit. The DP drillship
Pelerin has begun to establish a foothold in this segment of the
market.

Pelerin moved from South East Asia last year to drill two deep water
wells for Elf in the Congo, although the contract was terminated after
a single well.  However, after modifications in Cape Town, Pelerin will
drill two deep water wells for Shell in Block 16 in Angola starting in
May.

The critical players in the Nigerian deep water semi market are Shell
and Statoil, the latter operating on behalf of the Statoil/BP
consortium.  Statoil and Shell are due to drill up to six wells apiece
in the period 1995 to 1997, amounting to approximately six months
drilling by each company per year.

Initially, the two operators investigated combining their programmes,
and sharing a suitable rig.  A pre-tender was issued late last year for
a semi for a one year term starting at the end of 1994, with two
further one year options. Partly as a result of this pre-tender the
incompatibility of the two programmes in terms of rig specification and
timing became clear.

Both operators require semis equipped with 15,000 psi BOP stacks for
programmes starting early in 1995.  Shell plans three wells in over
2,500 ft of water and one in over 4,000 ft.  Two of these are planned
to be drilled from the first quarter of 1995.  After a four month gap
to early 1996, a further two wells will be drilled.  Shell is then
considering two further deep water wells in 1997.  In contrast five of
six wells planned by Statoil are understood to be in around 2,500 ft of
water, while one well in deeper water is being deferred until 1997.

For its programmes in 1995 and 1996, Statoil is believed to consider an
upgraded third generation semi to be suitable, whereas Shell will need
a more specialised fourth generation deep water rig.  Having
established the mutual incompatibility of their
programmes, the two operators are now seeking alternative partners to
fill the gaps in their requirement with a single rig contract.  Shell is
talking to Esso which is planning a well in over 3,250 ft of water in
the third quarter of 1995, and could, with minor adjustment, neatly fill
the gap between Shell's 1995 and 1996 programmes.

Statoil is understood to have circulated other operators with the
results of its joint pre-tender exercise with The Norwegian state
company is expected to tender by early April for a semi to start work
at the end of 1994.  As well as attempting to set up a partnership with
one or more other operators, it is thought Statoil could base its
contract on anything from one to six firm wells plus options.

Other operators in Nigeria
Other operators planning deep water wells offshore Nigeria from the end
of 1994 have already begun their own market inquiries.  This month Agip
has sought details of availability and indicative rates for a semi for
one firm well plus two options starting between December 1994 and
February 1995 based on one of two possible scenarios.  Option A is
based on a water depth of 3,600 ft and Option B on a maximum depth of
2,650 ft.  In both cases a 15,000 psi BOP, three mud pumps and
chain/wire mooring with propulsion assist form the basis of the
requirement.  In terms of start date Agip's plans appear to clash with
both Statoil and Shell, so some compromise may need to be worked with
one or the other depending whether Agip goes for Option A or B.

Among others planning deep water wells off Nigeria, Dupont has a
location in about 2,700 ft of water, although the spud is not now
expected until late in 1995.  Elf could also drill in 1995, although it
has indicated it might be 1996 before it drills on its acreage in
permits OPL 222 and OPL 223 where the water depth ranges from 3,000 to
6,000 ft.  Mobil has yet to formulate definite plans for its deep water
Nigerian acreage, but has indicated it intends to work with other
operators to ensure it has access to a suitable rig at the appropriate
time.

Angolan deep water market
Apart from its two wells this year with the drillship Pelerin, Shell
also plans three more deep water wells in Angola Block 16 starting in
mid-1995.  While it is not yet definite that the Pelerin will be
retained for this work, Shell does have options on the rig.  Subject to
successfully concluding its initial two well programme with Shell, the
Pelerin should be well placed to win a further contract with Elf which
is planning a well in Angola Block 17 in 3,300 ft of water spudding in
August or September 1994.  Also in Angola, BP is operator on Block 15
for a consortium including Statoil and Exxon where deep water drilling
will be required, although details of the start date are not yet known.

Congo, Gabon, Namibia and Equatorial Guinea
Elsewhere in West Africa exploration is gradually moving into deeper
water off the edge of the continental shelf.  In Congo, Elf has already
drilled a deep water well in 1994 and could return in the next year or
two to drill deep water well Moho-1. This had previously been planned
for a 1994 spud.  In Gabon, British Gas could drill a well in 1995 in
around 1800 ft of water, while Shell is planning a well in similar
depths on its Kenguerie Marin permit in mid-1996.

UMIC/Mobil is understood to be planning a well in 1700 ft of water
offshore Equatorial Guinea at the end of 1994.  Some acreage in the
recently licensed Namibian offshore also includes deep water territory.
 Norsk Hydro's block is in water depths up to 6,000 ft, but although
consideration has been given to drilling a well in around 3,000 ft of
water, this prospect now appears to have been dropped in favour of
concentrating on more accessible prospects.

OFFSHORE RIG TOP DRIVE SURVEY

Use of top drives in Americas below world average.

The Gulf of Mexico lags behind the rest of the world in the fitting of
top drives or power swivels on offshore rigs.  The top end of the jack-
up market in the US Gulf is well supplied with top drives, as would be
expected in an area with so much development drilling.  This is not the
case for the lower specification units.  However, recent increased
competition, with many rigs mobilising to the area last year, should
result in a rise in the number of top drives fitted.

Experience in the North Sea has shown that while there may well be an
initial dayrate premium gained by rigs with top drive, this disappears
as top drive installation becomes a necessity in order to remain in the
market.  All the competitive jack-ups and all the marketed semi-
submersibles in the North Sea are equipped with top drive.

Just under 52 % of the competitive offshore rig fleet is now equipped
with a top drive or power swivel.  64 % of semis in the world have top
drives, largely reflecting operator preference in the North Sea, where
many semis are still based.  Only 49 % of jack-ups worldwide have top
drives, reflecting the lower percentage of rigs so equipped in the
major jack-up market, the US Gulf, and in other parts of the Americas.

In India top drives are not an ONGC requirement, so statistically there
are a below average number of top drives in the Middle East/India
region.  Top drives are, however, widely used in the Middle East Gulf,
and to a slightly lesser extent in the Gulf of Suez.

Only three drillships have top drives, just 16 % of the world fleet,
principally because drillships are mostly involved in exploratory
rather development drilling.  Of the three which are fitted, Canmar has
two, and Sonat has one on the Discoverer 534.

Rigs with a higher initial capital cost and/or of a more sophisticated
design tend to be fitted with top drive. (see table p 3)  70 % of
deeper water jack-ups and 86 semis are equipped with top drive or a power
swivel.  Many older rigs are not marketed, and upgrades are not
contemplated, so the percentage of marketed rigs with top drive or a
power swivel .  Many older rigs with top drives amongst 1st and 2nd
generation semis and shallower water jack-ups is higher than it appears
statistically.

The provision of top drives and power swivels is dominated by Varco,
which has supplied 215 or 83 % of the top drives to the offshore mobile
competitive rig fleet.  Maritime Hydraulics is having increased success,
and to date has supplied 11 % of the units to the mobile fleet.
Portable top drives have been developed
by both companies.  National Oilwell and ACB,  the market.

A comparison of the investment which drilling contractors have made in
fitting top drives to offshore rigs is interesting.  Seven of the major
contractors (managing over 80 % of their rigs equipped with top drives.
 This figure would be increased to eight., if Global Marine had not
recently purchased three 116 jack-ups which arees.  Although the Gulf
of Mexico has, on average, a lower proportion of top drives compared
with the rest of the world, several of these contractors have the bulk
of their fleet in the US Gulf.

The figures for top drives fitted by contractors is revealing about
contractor status in the largest jack-up market in the world: the US
Gulf.  Three types of controse with over 50% of their rigs equipped
with top drives: Diamond, Dual, ENSCO, Global Marine, and Rowan.  Those
that have a few of their rigs so equipped: Chiles (although that rig is
currently in West Africa,) Marine Drilling, and Noble; and those with
no top drives yet fitted: Falcon Drilling, NR Marine and Southwestern.
Competition will ensure that more top drives are bought.

Explanation of definitions used in top drive tables
The accompanying tables (in the hard copy) on pages 5 to 13, and also
on page 3, give a 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation description for each
semi-submersible.  Many rigs, however, have been upgraded to have some
of the characteristics of the next generation of units; the earlier
Sedco 700 series being a particular case in point.  However, some
subjective demarcatioon of a generation to a semi-submersible has been
made more on build date than on physical characteristics.

Jack-ups in India have been grouped with those in the Middle East,
whereas drillships in India have been grouped with those in Asia,
reflecting the way the market for these two types of rigs tends to
function.

NORTH SEA SEMI DEMAND TUMBLES

As expected there has been a dramatic drop in the utilisation levels of
semi-submersibles in the North Sea.  In January there were 34 semis
working in NW Europe.  This is expected to drop to 22 or 23 in the next
month.  With the large exodus out of the North Sea at the end of last
year, demand elsewhere in the world for North Sea semi-submersibles has
for the foreseeable future mostly been satisfied.  There are few
opportunities for contractors now, and lay up for most is a
probability.

For the surplus North Sea semis there may be work for one in the
Mediterranean for Repsol off Egypt, and two deepwater units will be
required in West Africa at the end of the year.  Competition for these
will be strong, with the West African deepwater tenders likely to be
bid also by contractors with rigs in the Americas.  However, of the
North Sea semis, West Delta is mobilising to the Far East for a one
well plus two options contract with Mobil Indonesia in 1,800 ft of
water.  On previously awarded contracts Dan Baroness is substituting
for Dan Countess for Unocal Trinidad, with Dan Princess now mobilising
to LASMO Vietnam, leaving the older Dan Countess stacked in UK.  The
jack-up market in NW Europe has fairly low utilisation levels
anticipated for the rest of 1994, but demand is at least expected to
stay constant.

MEDITERRANEAN MARKET POSSIBLY NOW IN BALANCE

In the Mediterranean a potential shortage of a jack-up in the area has
probably been solved by Santa Fe which plans to mobilise Key Hawaii for
a 2 well plus option contract with Samedan offshore Tunisia.  Key
Hawaii is currently working for Mobil Nigeria, but NNPC payment
problems have made it difficult for Mobil to confirm a definite
extension of a proposed contract.

There are longer term tenders in the Mediterranean area, notably with
TPAO in the Sea of Marmara and Agip Italy where the results are as yet
undetermined.  Sonny Voss is a candidate for mobilising through the
Suez Canal, if the rig is awarded work in the Mediterranean.  INA's
jack-up Labin, based in the Mediterranean, was refused work in Tunisia
at the turn of the year as a protest against political events in former
Yugoslavia.  Whether this will extend to other Muslim countries remains
to be seen, but in such a small market, currently just nine jackups,
this could be of importance.

The award of QGPC's term programme off Qatar will affect rig contracts
in the Gulf of Suez, and possibly the Mediterranean.  QGPC tenders were
lodged at the end of December, and the operator is nearing a decision,
but has not yet awarded the work.  Santa Fe has offered a rig to QGPC,
and is apparently in competition with Maersk for the contract.  If
Santa Fe is successful it will have to mobilise a rig from outside the
Arabian Gulf, probably from the Gulf of Suez or Singapore.

GULF OF MEXICO JACK-UP MARKET FUTURE UNCLEAR

The Gulf of Mexico jack-up market, apart from the Far East and West
African floater markets, now remains the only one in the world where
utilisation in 1994 might be reasonable.  As current natural gas prices
are still well over the $2/mmbtu level, as are the futures prices, the
prognosis is good.  Confidence has not fully returned to the market
after the optimism shown at the end of 1993 before the oil price drop.
Plans being formulated at the moment by many of the operators will be
critical for the market.  A survey of operators' intentions was
intended earlier in the year for this issue of World Rig Forecast, but
in the event, many plans were not firm enough to make a comprehensive
survey worth publishing.

With the large number of mobilisations into the Gulf of Mexico in 1993,
and the heavy refurbishment programme of previously stacked units,
there must remain a doubt about utilisation levels of jack-ups in 1994.
 The top end of the market is showing continuing strength with high
specification units being extended at end 1993 rates.  Those wishing to
re-enter the market after lay-up are having to cut rates.
