TELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNet

Pressler Says Telecom Vote May Not Occur Until March;
Nine of 11 Senate Conferees Likely Will Sign Report

          Although a quick resolution of the federal budget impasse
could pave the way for congressional consideration of pending
telecommunications legislation as early as this week, industry
observers are betting that final votes likely will be taken later
this month or in late February.  House and Senate lawmakers could
consider a telecom legislative compromise shortly after they
return to Washington for President Clinton's State of the Union
address, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23.  If that window of
opportunity is missed, Congress may not consider the measure
until after the Feb. 20 presidential primary in New Hampshire.

          HIGHLIGHTS:  Pressler plans to introduce foreign ownership
measure soon...Conferees clarify facilities-based competition
requirement for Bell company market entry...Conference agreement
will not supersede antitrust consent decrees...Rural advocates
concerned about effect of geographic rate averaging language on
business services...Draft calls for "explicit" universal service
support mechanism.

          Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), Chairman of the telecom
conference committee, acknowledged last Friday that a vote may
not occur until March.  "I hope it doesn't go that long, but I
want all the conferees' concerns to be dealt with," he said
during a televised "roundtable" discussion of the measure.  

          Progress on telecom legislation remains frozen until
congressional leaders reach a deal breaking the budget impasse
and sending furloughed federal government employees back to work. 
Upcoming presidential primary elections also may slow
consideration of the legislation.

          Industry sources last week said Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole (R., Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) may be
unhappy with some provisions in the compromise.  Sen. Dole
reportedly wants to see language reinserted into the measure that
would preempt states from maintaining rate-of-return regulation. 
Speaker Gingrich reportedly is troubled by the removal of
language addressing the foreign ownership of common carrier radio
licenses and provisions addressing radio spectrum, Internet
regulation, and media concentration issues.

           Sen. Pressler said last Friday that a majority of Senate
conferees will approve the legislative compromise crafted late
last month (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  A draft of the 280-page
compromise and an accompanying 93-page explanatory statement
began circulating last week.  "We have essentially nine of the 11
Senate conferees," he said.  "We don't have all of those
signatures yet, but we have indications that we will."  He
acknowledged that Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) likely will not
sign the report.

          Sen. McCain has criticized the compromise measure because
provisions amending current restrictions on foreign ownership of
common carrier radio licenses were removed.  Industry sources
said they believe Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is the other
Senate conferee who remains unhappy with the compromise. 
Referring to House conferees, Sen. Pressler said, "I know there
are some problems over there, but we hope to work those out."

          Additional telecom bills may be introduced in the near
future, he predicted, adding that he still hopes to introduce a
bill addressing foreign ownership of common carrier radio
licenses.  "My original bill had that in it but I had to give up
some things I wanted," he said.

          Although he had declared the pending telecom legislation
"dead as Elvis," House telecom subcommittee Vice Chairman Michael
G. Oxley (R., Ohio) said last week that the compromise measure
could "very well come to life with some resuscitation."  House
leaders have been preoccupied with budget negotiations and have
not had much time to focus on telecom legislation, he said. 
Until the budget impasse is resolved, telecom legislation will
remain "in limbo," he said.

          Industry sources last week said a majority of House telecom
conference committee members have committed to sign the
conference report.  But the compromise language apparently still
has not been circulated for their signatures.  House Commerce
Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley (R., Va.) is reluctant to
distribute the report for signatures before telecom subcommittee
Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas) returns to Washington and
decides whether to support the compromise measure, industry
sources said.  Rep. Fields returned to Texas late last month to
be with his pregnant wife right after the "framework for
agreement" on the final telecom bill was announced.  Shortly
before departing Washington, he criticized the compromise measure
as too regulatory.  It is unclear whether Rep. Fields now
supports the compromise.

          Meanwhile, a draft of the proposed conference report's
"joint explanatory statement" began circulating on Capitol Hill
last week.  Language addressing Bell company entry into the
interLATA (local access and transport area) service market
explains the conferees' intent in imposing a requirement that
Bell companies face facilities-based competition and comply with
the legislation's local exchange competition "checklist."

          The explanatory statement says that "with respect to the
facilities-based competitor requirement, the presence of a
competitor offering the following services specifically does not
suffice to meet the requirement:  (1) exchange access service,
(2) telephone exchange service offered exclusively through the
resale of the [Bell company's] local telephone exchange service,
and (3) cellular service."  To trigger Bell company entry into
the interLATA service market, the legislation requires that a
competitor "offer telephone exchange service either exclusively
over its own facilities or predominantly over its own facilities
in combination with the resale of another carrier's service," the
statement says.

          The "predominantly over its own facilities" language was
included to "ensure a competitor offering service exclusively
through the resale of the [Bell company's] local telephone
service does not qualify, and that an unaffiliated competing
provider is present in the market," it adds.

Conference Agreement Does Not Supersede Consent Decrees

          Conferees believe that the AT&T Corp. and GTE Corp.
antitrust consent decrees and the decree which permitted AT&T to
acquire McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc., are "continuing
injunctions rather than final judgements."  To avoid possible
constitutional problems, the proposed legislation does not
supersede these "continuing injunctions."  Rather, the
legislation provides that activities now subject to the consent
decrees will be subject to the "requirements and obligations"
imposed by the Communications Act of 1934, which the pending
legislation will amend.

          "The conferees intend that the court shall retain
jurisdiction over the three consent decrees for the limited
purpose of dealing with any conduct or activity occurring before
the date of [the pending measure's] enactment," the statement
says.  "Nothing in the language eliminating the prospective
effect of the two consent decrees should be construed as
eliminating the jurisdiction of the court to deal with pre-
enactment conduct or activities under the consent decrees."  The
legislation also should not be "construed as creating or
continuing in any way the GTE consent decree's prohibition on GTE
or its operating companies' entry into the interexchange market."

          The legislation will prohibit Bell companies from entering
the alarm monitoring service business for five years.  Although
Ameritech Corp. will be permitted to continue providing alarm
monitoring services, it will not be allowed to expand that
business until after Nov. 30, 2000. 

          The conference agreement modified language regarding the
provision of pay phone service.  If the FCC makes a "public-
interest" determination, it may choose "not to allow the [Bell
companies] to have the same rights as independent pay phone
providers" in negotiating which interLATA carriers will be
"presubscribed" at the companies' pay phones, according to the
statement.  "In addition, the conferees clarify...that the
location provider has the ultimate decision-making authority in
determining interLATA services in connection with the choice of
pay phone providers."

          The explanatory statement also clarifies the conferees'
intent in adding a provision barring states from exercising
regulatory authority on issues on which the FCC has decided to
"forbear" from exercising its own regulatory authority.  "The
conferees intend this subsection to limit state enforcement of
federal statutes and regulations from which the Commission
determines to forbear," the statement says.  "This subsection is
not intended to limit or preempt state enforcement of state
statutes or regulations." 

          Trade groups seeking to protect the interests of rural
telephone companies are concerned about a change in legislative
language addressing geographic rate averaging for interexchange
service.  The latest draft of the measure requires interexchange
carriers (IXCs) to charge residential subscribers in rural and
high-cost areas the same rates they charge to such customers in
urban areas.  A previous draft of the legislation did not
specifically refer to residential customers, but the industry
groups had understood that it applied to both residential and
business subscribers.

          Rural telecom advocates are worried that the new language
could result in geographic rate deaveraging for business services
because those services are not mentioned specifically in the
bill.  In the draft report, conferees note that they do not
expect the legislation to alter geographic rate averaging
policies now enforced by the FCC.

          Conferees expect that interexchange carriers making
unauthorized changes to a subscriber's primary IXC ("slamming")
will reimburse the original carrier for forgone revenues.  But
they also expect the FCC's rules to "provide that consumers are
made whole" when they are slammed.  "Specifically, the
Commission's rules should require that carriers guilty of
`slamming' should be held liable for premiums, including travel
bonuses, that would otherwise have been earned by telephone
subscribers," the statement says.

          It clarifies that states may require a carrier seeking to
offer services in a rural area to meet the legislation's
requirements for designation as a carrier eligible to receive
universal service support payments.  "That is, the state may
require the competitor to offer service and advertise throughout
the service area served by a rural telephone company," the draft
says.  The provision would not apply if the rural telephone
company has received an exemption, suspension, or modification
that effectively prevents a competitor from meeting the "eligible
carrier" requirements.

Conferees Would Like `Explicit' Universal Service Support

          Conferees intend, "to the extent possible," that any
universal service support mechanisms maintained or created by the
legislation will be "explicit" rather than "implicit," the
statement says.  Conferees do not view the FCC's existing docket
80-286 federal-state joint board proceeding on jurisdictional
separations issues as an "appropriate foundation" for the
universal service proceeding required by the legislation (TR,
July 17, 1995).  Within 15 months of the legislation's enactment,
the FCC must act on a federal-state joint board's recommendations
for defining the services to be subsidized by federal universal
service support mechanisms.

          The legislation requires all carriers of interstate telecom
services to contribute to the "preservation and advancement" of
universal service.  The FCC may exempt a carrier from the
requirement if its contribution would be "de minimis."  Eligible
telecom carriers can receive federal support only to "provide,
maintain, and upgrade facilities and services for universal
service in the area for which the support is received," the
statement says.

          The conference committee included legislative language to
"ensure that the Commission could, if future circumstances
warrant, include commercial mobile service providers which
provide telephone exchange service or exchange access in the
definition of `local exchange carrier,'" the statement continues.

          It also explains the conferees' compromise on controversial
proposals to protect minors from gaining access to "indecent"
material through the Internet.  "Use of the indecency standard
poses no significant risk to the free-wheeling and vibrant nature
of discourse or to serious, literary, and artistic works that
currently can be found on the Internet, and which is expected to
continue and grow," the statement says.  "As the Supreme Court
itself noted when upholding the constitutionality of indecency
prohibitions, prohibiting indecency merely focuses speakers to
recast their message into less offensive terms but does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of communication. 
Likewise, requiring that access restrictions be imposed to
protect minors from exposure to indecent material does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of the indecent
communication.  It merely puts it in its appropriate place:  away
from children."

          The draft statement also outlines the conference committee's
reasoning in streamlining the regulatory obligations imposed on
operators of "open video systems."  The conference panel expects
that common carriers will be encouraged to deploy open video
systems, introducing "vigorous" competition in entertainment and
information markets.  Conferees also recognize that common
carriers deploying such systems will be new entrants in
established markets and "deserve lighter regulatory burdens to
level the playing field," the statement says.  In addition, the
development of competition means "that government oversight and
regulation can and should be reduced."

          Regulation of the "cable programming services" tier of cable
TV offerings will sunset March 31, 1999, the statement says.  It
describes a new "effective competition" test for determining when
deregulation of both the cable programming and basic service
tiers should occur.  The test concludes that effective
competition is in place when a telephone company or any
multichannel video programming distributor is offering comparable
video programming services "directly to subscribers by any means"
in an unaffiliated cable TV operator's franchise area.

`888' CODE DEADLINE

          The LEC National Product Team has pushed back the
implementation date for the new "888" toll-free service access
code from March 1 to March 11, according to a letter sent by
MCI's Vice President-federal regulatory affairs, Donald F. Evans,
to the team's Chairman, Dan Winters of Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co.  The Jan. 5 letter says Mr. Winters "indicated to
MCI that the cause of this delay is largely due" to Bell
Communications Research's "missing the due date for delivery. . .
of the [service control point] software to the first field
verification site."

          Mr. Evans added, "We demand that the March 1, 1996, date be
maintained."  At TR's Friday news deadline an FCC-industry 888
meeting slated for Jan. 10 at 9 a.m. in Bellcore's Washington
offices was scheduled to proceed as planned, despite the partial
government shutdown.

AT&T's Workforce Cuts Could Trigger Industry-Wide
Job Reductions, Streamlining, Analysts Predict

          AT&T Corp.'s recent announcement of massive job cuts likely
will trigger further workforce reductions--and other forms of
financial belt-tightening--throughout the telecommunications
industry, particularly among the seven Bell regional holding
companies and GTE Corp., industry observers told TR.  They also
suggested that other U.S. interexchange carriers, and even some
foreign service providers, may further streamline their
operations in the wake of AT&T's action--the largest single job
reduction in the U.S. telecom industry's history and one of the
largest ever announced by an American corporation.  But analysts
differed over the scope of further job cuts, with some observers
noting that many companies already have trimmed their payrolls in
recent years.

          HIGHLIGHTS:  AT&T to cut 40,000 positions, 13% of
workforce...Company will take $4 billion post-tax charge against
1995 earnings...Analysts warn that job cuts could be double-edged
sword...Wall Street bulls say move will make AT&T more
competitive...CWA's President calls job reductions "demoralizing"
to AT&T workers.

          Recognizing that it will be operating in a dramatically
changed competitive environment in the future, AT&T last week
announced plans to eliminate 40,000 jobs over three years, a
reduction of more than 13% of its total present-day workforce of
about 300,000.  The 40,000 figure was double the amount that many
analysts had expected (TR, Oct. 2, 1995, p. 9).  

          AT&T also revealed plans to close, sell, or consolidate some
facilities and write off some assets.  Last week's announcement
represented the "next step" in AT&T's plan to restructure itself,
explained Rick Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer at AT&T, during a Jan. 2 press briefing.  Four
months ago (TR, Sept. 25, 1995), AT&T stunned many industry
observers by unveiling plans to divide itself into three separate
companies:  a telecom services provider, a systems and technology
company, and a computer manufacturer.

          The job reductions, will enable the spun-off companies to be
more "focused," make decisions faster, develop competitive cost
structures, and become leaders in their respective industries,
Mr. Miller said.  AT&T will retain employees with "the right sets
of skills" to keep the three spun-off operations competitive in
the future.  Meanwhile, he said, savings stemming from the job
reductions "will allow the three companies to be competitive." 
Sources agreed that the three future spin-off companies will be
able to operate with relatively small corporate staffs.  Mr.
Miller emphasized that AT&T now will be well-positioned to build
out its personal communications service operations this year.  He
noted that in its third quarter 1995 earnings report, AT&T had
suggested that restructuring charges could be expected.  

Analysts See `Ripple' Effect Throughout Industry

          William H. Gaik, National Director of Deloitte & Touche
Consulting Group's Telecommunications and Electronic Services
practice, said AT&T's announcement could put pressure on all of
its competitors to eliminate more positions and further
streamline operations.  Noting that major telecom service
providers now compete in a global marketplace, he told TR that
France Telecom and Deutsche Telecom, which have not undertaken
significant restructuring programs yet, may now feel pressured to
do so.

          A Communications Workers of America spokesman predicted,
however, that AT&T's move will not trigger massive telecom
industry layoffs.  During the past three or four years, carriers-
-particularly major local exchange carriers (LECs)--have been
"downsizing" in an effort to prepare for a more competitive
marketplace, he noted.  The CWA spokesman maintained that LECs
already have pared away too many jobs--to the point that they are
undermining their service-quality performance.  Because AT&T is
so much larger than most carriers, any job reductions at other
companies likely would be on a smaller scale, he added.

          The job reductions concern the group but they nevertheless
appear to be "in line" with the restructuring plan announced last
fall, the spokesman said, adding that AT&T has been "management
top-heavy" for too long.  CWA analysts believe the spun-off
companies will begin hiring back management personnel once they
begin operating separately, he said.

          Philip Sirlin, a telecommunications analyst with Schroder
Wertheim & Co., Inc., told TR that the AT&T announcement could
generate more job cuts in the telecom industry because "CEOs
don't want to be perceived as being asleep at the switch."  In
particular, he predicted further workforce reductions among the
Bell companies.  MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. also
may need to "reexamine" the operations of their long distance
service units, Mr. Sirlin added.

          But AT&T's action may be a double-edged sword, some
observers suggested.  Although it likely will make AT&T more
competitive in the short term, the job-cutting move could
backfire if AT&T's service quality slips, they explained.  Mr.
Gaik told TR that the job cutbacks could create a "highly
disgruntled workforce," a result that could "spill over" to
customers in the form of poor service.  That, in turn, could help
AT&T's competitors.  Mr. Gaik added that savings stemming from
the job reductions will enable AT&T to price its services more
aggressively and to invest in new technologies.

Wall Street Views AT&T's Action as Necessary Step

          Wall Street analysts generally praised AT&T's action.  In a
statement, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., said the "cost-
cutting moves should improve margins, increase cash flows, and
further solidify the company's Aa3 senior unsecured rating."  It
added that AT&T is "well-positioned to meet the competition and
potentially can improve its credit rating over the long term." 
But Moody's warned that AT&T "faces many long-term challenges as
deregulation and increased competition...exert pressure on
telecommunications margins."  Although the "ultimate" capital
structure of the spin-off companies has not been established,
Moody's is "confident that AT&T's credit quality will not be
seriously impaired."

          Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. reaffirmed AT&T's senior
debt rating of "AA+" (Double-A-Plus) following the company's Jan.
2 announcement.  It said the action reflects AT&T's progress in
refocusing on communications services.  While its core telecom
services business may face growing competition as LECs enter the
interLATA (local access and transport area) service market,
AT&T's restructuring "will help position it to cope with the
added competition," Duff & Phelps said.  "The reduction in
business risk associated with the divestiture of [certain]
enterprises will strengthen overall credit quality.  Meanwhile,
the proceeds raised will give the company added financial
flexibility and allow it to capitalize its remaining units in a
manner consistent with its current rating level."

          In an investment analysis released prior to last week's
announcement, Merrill Lynch had predicted that AT&T would
announce job cuts early this year.  It had suggested that the
company might target some of its savings "to fund the longer term
investments they need to make."  Those would include "entering
the local telephone business, investing overseas as a new entrant
(e.g., Mexico), adding to its marketing staff and promotions, and
rebuilding billing systems" to reduce its dependence on LEC
billing and collection services.

AT&T Takes `Charge' Against Earnings To Cover Restructuring
Expenses

          AT&T will take a post-tax charge of about $4 billion against
fourth-quarter 1995 earnings to cover the cost of implementing
its plan to restructure into three independent companies.  The
charge will be about $6 billion before taxes and "will reduce
fourth quarter net income by approximately $4 billion or about
$2.50 a share," AT&T said.  Those figures could change by the
time AT&T closes its 1995 fourth quarter books later this month,
it added.

          About 70% of the 40,000 jobs will be eliminated this year;
the remaining positions will be terminated in 1997 and possibly
1998.  Sixty percent of the eliminated jobs will be management
positions.  Eighty-five percent of the job reductions will affect
AT&T's domestic operations, and the remaining 15% will be
allocated among several foreign operations, AT&T officials said.

          About 30,000 of the job cuts will be involuntary. 
Meanwhile, 6,500 AT&T managers already have accepted a voluntary
severance package, and an additional 4,000 employees likely will
remain with business units the company intends to sell.  The
severance package was offered to 72,000 managers before the end
of last year.  AT&T officials said last week that the package may
be extended to an additional 40,000 managers, potentially
reducing the number of lay-offs.  A decision to extend the
voluntary severance package will be made within the next 60 days
or so.

          AT&T did not provide information about the planned job
reductions disaggregated by country, state, or company facility. 
But it did reveal plans to cut 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in New Jersey,
where it is headquartered.  The spun-off AT&T telecom services
company will have 110,000 employees after job reductions of about
17,000, AT&T said.  The systems and technology company would have
108,000 employees after reductions of 23,000.  Of the 40,000 jobs
to be eliminated, 10,000 will be corporate-wide staff positions
in the present-day AT&T information systems, human resources, and
financial operations units.  AT&T does not anticipate significant
job reductions in the future, but small-scale job-cutting actions
would occur, a company spokesman said.  AT&T said the fourth-
quarter charge will cover:

          *  Workforce reductions resulting in severance pay and
related costs totaling about $2.6 billion before taxes;

          *  The "write down" of the value of assets, estimated to
total about $1.7 billion;

          *  The closing, selling, or consolidation of facilities that
would not be "strategic" for the spun-off companies' operations
(total costs could reach $1.1 billion); and

          *  Other unspecified actions totaling $700 million.  This
could involve a variety of miscellaneous costs pertaining to the
restructuring, the spokesman said.

          AT&T officials would not comment on what facilities might be
closed or sold, saying that announcements will be made in "due
course."  AT&T already has unveiled plans to sell its Paradyne
unit, a Key Largo, Fla.-based manufacturer of modems for personal
computers (TR, Oct. 23, 1995).  The actions related to the charge
mainly will affect the new AT&T services company and the new
systems and technology company, which will provide network,
business, and consumer technology and equipment.

          AT&T already had announced last year (TR, Sept. 25, 1995, p.
2) that it will eliminate 8,500 jobs at AT&T Global Information
Solutions, which will become part of the spun-off computer
company.  Those jobs are in addition to the 40,000 jobs
reductions announced last week.  AT&T had taken a $1.5 billion
charge against third quarter 1995 earnings to reflect the cost of
the GIS restructuring.

          The new AT&T services company will reduce its workforce
through the "continued application" of new technologies,
consolidation of operator services, and a reduction of marketing
and sales support positions.  It also plans to reduce the value
of some investments, such as its stake in Canadian carrier Unitel
Communications, Inc. (TR, Oct. 2, 1995).  Plans also call for
altering several of the new AT&T services company's online
services by adopting Internet-based technical platforms and for
modifying some messaging services.  Those plans will require AT&T
to write down "the value of some unneeded network facilities--
such as microwave towers--and refocus some of its undersea cable
operations," AT&T said.

Allen Expresses Regret, CWA's Bahr Expresses Bitterness

          AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Allen
said in an electronic mail message to AT&T employees last week
that the job reductions are driven by changes in the marketplace,
as well as by customers' needs, new technology, and public
policy.  "I understand how wrenching it will be for employees and
their families," Mr. Allen said.  "But the actions we are
announcing today are absolutely essential if our businesses are
to be competitive."  For workers leaving the company, AT&T will
provide a severance package, access to a job database, support
for retraining and education, and workshops on financial planning
and stress management.  Employees may be considered for jobs in
the new companies six months after they leave.

          In a statement, CWA President Morton Bahr used unusually
harsh words to criticize AT&T's action.  "AT&T has started off
the New Year by demoralizing its workforce and delivering a
setback to the joint cooperative program we have been attempting
to build with the company over the past three years," he said.  

          Mr. Bahr added that CWA did not receive "the courtesy of
advance notification of today's mass-cutback announcement, which
in the past has been the usual practice prior to such
announcements."  It may take up to 60 days, he said, for AT&T to
provide details on the jobs and locations that will be affected.

          "This is yet another case of the kind of mindless job
destruction that has terrorized working Americans in recent years
as corporate executives play to Wall Street and manipulate their
stock prices," Mr. Bahr said.  

          AT&T "apparently pulled a number out of the air, a big
number that will give their stock price a boost, while they
decide over the next few months what their real employment needs
will be for the new corporate structure."  He added that AT&T
employees and their families "will live in fear not knowing when
and where the ax will fall."  Mr. Bahr said that if AT&T wants to
ensure the success of the three spin-off companies, it should
work to improve employee morale instead of fostering "a climate
of bitterness."

          AT&T plans to file a "registration statement" with the
Securities and Exchange Commission late this month or early next
month for an initial public stock offering for the planned
systems and technology company.  An AT&T spokesman said the
company hopes to offer the stock by the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, AT&T last month asked the Internal Revenue Service
to issue a ruling allowing it to distribute stock in the new
systems and technology company tax-free to AT&T shareholders.  An
IRS ruling against AT&T's proposal could "complicate" plans to
spin off the systems and technology company and force AT&T to
"revisit" the spin-off plans, an AT&T spokesman told TR.

Time Warner Closes Acquisition of Cablevision

          Time Warner, Inc., has closed its acquisition of Cablevision
Industries, Inc., a transaction that positions it to offer
additional video and telephony services in several states.  Time
Warner gained about 1.3 million cable TV subscribers, bringing
its total subscription to 11.5 million customers.  The deal,
announced last year as a stock transaction valued at $2.7 billion
(TR, February 13, 1995), also allows Time Warner to complete its
cable TV "clustering" plan.

          "Our dramatically strengthened cable clusters will keep Time
Warner in the forefront of the core cable business as we roll out
enhanced advertising, pay-per-view, cable online services,
telecommunications services, and interactivity throughout the
systems," said Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer.  He added that as a result of the transaction,
more than three-quarters of Time Warner's customers will be
located in 34 groupings of more than 100,000 customers each.  The
Cablevision properties will augment Time Warner's existing cable
TV holdings in New York, Florida, and North Carolina, he said.

AT&T To Sell Circuit Board Plant in Restructuring

          AT&T Corp. will sell its Microelectronics business unit's
circuit board manufacturing plant in Richmond, Va., as part of a
plan to reduce its workforce and close or sell certain facilities
(see separate story).  AT&T announced last year that it will
divide itself into three separate companies focusing on
telecommunications services, systems and technologies, and
computer manufacturing (TR, Sept. 25, 1995).  The Richmond plant,
which manufactures printed circuit boards and "backplanes," has
about 1,950 employees.  Printed circuit boards, also called
printed wiring boards, contain several layers of wiring paths to
connect integrated circuits and other electronic components. 
Backplanes connect circuit boards within electronic devices.

          AT&T said it hopes that few, if any, of the employees will
lose their jobs under new ownership.  "We plan to initiate
discussions with potential buyers in the next few weeks," said
AT&T Microelectronics President Curtis J. Crawford.  "We hope to
find a company that is committed to keeping the
Richmond...workforce substantially intact."  He added that the
largest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network Systems,
"expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works as a major
supplier after the sale."

          Tommy Thurston, President of Local 2260 of the
Communications Workers of America--which represents nonmanagement
employees at the plant--said, "We had just turned the corner on
making the plant profitable for the first time in a long time,
and this is the thanks we get."  A CWA spokesman in Washington
said union officials have been assured that CWA will have
"successorship rights" under a new owner, allowing it to continue
as the employee's bargaining agent.  But it is uncertain whether
the union's three-year contract, negotiated last summer with
AT&T, would continue to apply.

          AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems and
technology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997. 
Asked to explain why AT&T is selling the Richmond plant, a
spokesman for the business unit said company planners have
decided that "there's no strategic advantage in owning the
factory."  

          "When we look at how Microelectronics should invest our
resources for the greatest leverage and competitive advantage, we
find it makes more sense to invest in some of our other
businesses...Historically AT&T has been extremely vertically
oriented--we tended to make everything we needed," the spokesman
said.  "But over the years, we've reevaluated and asked whether
we really need to be making these [products] ourselves.  In the
case of these circuit boards, we decided we didn't."

          He added that AT&T hopes to complete the sale by year-end. 
Ideally, the buyer would be a company already manufacturing
circuit boards and seeking to expand both its market share and
manufacturing capacity, he said.  An industry source told TR that
talks with one potential buyer are well advanced.  "I've heard
that the negotiations are down to the final wrangling over
price," the source said.

Shareholders Approve Disney-CapCities/ABC Deal

          Shareholders of The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC,
Inc., overwhelmingly have approved Disney's planned acquisition
of CapCities (TR, Aug. 7, 1995).  The deal still requires
approval by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, whose
review could be delayed by the partial shutdown of the federal
government.  

          It also requires FCC approval of the transfer of certain
television licenses.  One observer last week told TR that the FCC
had intended to act on the license transfers at a scheduled Jan.
18 open meeting, which may be postponed.  Justice review of the
deal is expected to follow the FCC's action.  Disney is involved
in the Americast joint video programming venture with Ameritech
Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBC Communications, Inc., and GTE Corp.
(TR, Oct. 23, 1995).

Md. PSC Adopts `Phase II' Competition Rules;
CLECs Praise `Favorable' Interconnection Rates

          In a decision praised immediately by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commission
has established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions for
carriers planning to compete in the provision of services to
business end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.
8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission said
that "an essential service such as interconnection should not be
priced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commission
are "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlined
terms for offering unbundled network elements, established an
interim local number portability method, and began a separate
proceeding on universal service issues.

          The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the state
in 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application for
permission to provide local exchange service (TR, May 2, 1994). 
In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, it
established interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensation
for call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland to
interconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem and
central office switching facilities.

          In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantic
had proposed an interconnection rate structure consisting of
three parts:  (1) a per-minute rate mirroring intrastate,
interexchange access charges, minus the carrier common line
charge; (2) a monthly per-line rate designed to capture the
difference between the revenues received from the per-minute rate
and Bell Atlantic's costs for building a "ubiquitous network" in
the state; and (3) a universal service component to be determined
in the universal service proceeding.

          Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"
should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on the
co-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnection
rates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,
citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitous
network" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier of
last resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all local
exchange service providers be required to charge each other the
same cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued that
establishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient and
would promote fair competition.

          Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," the
commission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection rates
paid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not full
recovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedent
certainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recover
joint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples in
excess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," the
PSC said.  

          It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"
intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data on
traffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specific
interconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.

          The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnection
provided at tandem switching offices, saying that such
interconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted a
rate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection at
Bell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU for
interconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay the
same 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on the
CLEC's networks.

          Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previous
interim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. 
In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companies
have in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnection
but have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating calls
that originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.

          Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it had
proposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would have
allowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on Bell
Atlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The flat-
rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' true
cost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport's
proposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an MOU-
based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-rate
arrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commission
said it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based rate
system before reconsidering other rate schemes.

          The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of Bell
Atlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFS
and Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundled
voice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on those
trials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939
and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business links
and services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  The
commission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directing
the telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a rate
structure proposed by the PSC's staff.

          Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be set
at levels that would be less than or equal to the price of
equivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, the
commission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the prices
for unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios between
the direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That will
allow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of the
amount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone service
rates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs to
compete, the PSC reasoned.

PSC Bans Bundling of InterLATA Services

          To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlantic
operates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA (local
access and transport area) services bundled with local exchange
services.  CLECs had contended that new entrants should be able
to offer such service packages because Bell Atlantic retains
significant competitive advantages over them.  The PSC said new
market entrants may provide interLATA services but cannot package
them with local exchange service until the interLATA line-of-
business restriction on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were
allowed to delay providing equal access for intraLATA toll calls
until Bell Atlantic is required to do so.  The PSC also:

          *  Directed Bell Atlantic to file tariffs to offering remote
call-forwarding as an interim number portability system,
determining that rates for that service should be priced at the
incremental network costs of providing it; 

          *  Allowed CLECs to adjust their local calling area
boundaries; and

          *  Gave CLECs the option of (1) providing their own trunks
connecting their end offices to Bell Atlantic emergency "911"
tandems or (2) purchasing trunks from the telco at tariffed
rates.

          The commission denied AT&T Corp.'s request that it set
interim "wholesale" rates for resale of local exchange services,
citing the need for further study.  AT&T has sought authority to
provide local exchange services to business and residential users
in the state (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The commission is scheduled to
discuss AT&T's application Jan. 17, a PSC spokesman said.                                                             

          A separate proceeding was initiated to explore universal
service issues.  The commission noted, however, that the decision
to launch that proceeding is not a "predetermination that a
universal service fee of some sort will be necessary."  The PSC
will examine whether Bell Atlantic needs a "special" level of
support to serve some customers, but it said, "The evidence
presented in this proceeding leaves us believing that far from
being a negative factor in its operations, the ubiquitous nature
of Bell Atlantic's network in Maryland presents [the telco] with
marketing and business advantages not enjoyed by its
competitors."

          Growth of the local exchange market also should provide Bell
Atlantic with competitive opportunities even if competitors
capture some market share, it added.

          Dan Whelan, President of Bell Atlantic-Maryland, said the
commission recognized that the telco is at a competitive
disadvantage until it can compete in additional interexchange
markets.  The order, however, left "many questions unanswered,
not the least of which is how Bell Atlantic-Maryland can continue
to provide affordable service to all Marylanders when the new
competitors serve only the lucrative business markets," Mr.
Whelan said.  The decision "significantly lowers many of the
technical and economic barriers to local exchange competition,"
said Larry Burgden, Vice President and General Manager for
Teleport's Maryland network.  But "full-blown competition will
not exist in Maryland until the [PSC] acts on other items before
it, such as number portability," he added.

COLORADO HEARING

          The Colorado Public Utilities Commission will hold a series
of hearings Jan. 11- Feb. 23 in its proceeding to establish local
exchange competition rules.  

          A "working group" of industry, commission, Office of
Consumer Counsel, and consumer group representatives recently
proposed local exchange competition rules to the PUC, pursuant to
a state telecom law enacted last year (TR, May 8 and Dec. 11,
1995).  The commission must adopt rules by July 1, a spokeswoman
said.

Ameritech-Michigan Proposes Local Exchange Resale Rates

          Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposing
rates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. 
The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,
offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some network
services.  Discounts would vary for different network elements
and services and would increase with volume and term commitments,
an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject to
PSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.

          Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting the
requirements of the recently passed Michigan Telecommunications
Act (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%
wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. 
Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on local
usage rates for residential services and 11% discount on local
usage rates for business services.  The discount rate for
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services would
be 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritech
spokeswoman said.

          Competitors also would be able to purchase for resale such
enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as well as
advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN (integrated
services digital network) offerings.  Wholesale discounts would
allow competitors to operate without having to build their own
facilities, giving them "an avenue for entering the marketplace
rapidly," said Jim Wilkes, President of Ameritech-Michigan.

          Meanwhile, AT&T announced last week that it plans to compete
with Ameritech and other local exchange carriers in Wisconsin,
pending the adoption of local exchange competition rules by that
state's Public Service Commission.  AT&T said it initially would
provide service through resale but eventually would offer
facilities-based service.  The company wants to enter the market
by the middle of this year.  "Based upon the [Wisconsin] PSC's
recent decision giving customers the ability to choose the short-
haul long distance provider of their choice, we're confident that
the PSC also will rule in favor of maximum competition," said
Bonnie Manzi, AT&T Vice President-central region.  She called on
the PSC to adopt rules fostering "commercially feasible resale"
of local exchange service and "reasonable" network
interconnection arrangements.

Wireless Industry Pledges To Resolve
Hearing-Aid Compatibility Problems

          Conceding that all digital wireless communications systems
potentially may cause interference to hearing aids, wireless
industry representatives have pledged to develop ways to make
their services accessible to the 6 million U.S. wearers of such
devices.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4 in
Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipment
manufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility
to determine what transmission technologies they will use in the
future.  But the Commission must ensure that people with
disabilities have access to telecom services, he added.

          Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called the
European model of mandating the use of specific digital wireless
technologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us into
mandating their particular technology for the use of the
airwaves," he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead
to the resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be
ready to protect the interests of groups that traditionally have
wielded little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.

          Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy
groups should work together to identify compatibility problems,
he continued.  "This will be a continuous process because
repeatedly we will find incompatibilities between wireless
devices and hearing aids."  He said the Commission anticipates
that specific "action items" will be generated by the two-day
summit meeting, which was sponsored by the Personal
Communications Industry Association.

          The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by
hearing-aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that
the FCC initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems
using the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital
wireless standard to interfere with hearing aids (TR, June 12,
1995).  Wireless industry representatives, however, told the
Commission that it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking
proceeding before conclusive test results were available (TR,
July 24, 1995).

          During last week's meeting industry representatives
emphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibility
already is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, reported that the Center for the Study of
Electromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will release
the initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is
conducting a field evaluation of bystander interference problems
using the personal communications service (PCS) network recently
activated in the Washington, D.C., area by American Personal
Communications.  Results of that research are expected to be
available Feb. 15.  Mr. Wheeler said digital-service interference
problems are no more daunting than those the cellular industry
faced when it introduced analog wireless equipment more than 10
years ago.

          Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless
phones meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,
CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids that
are designed and tested to meet the requirements of the European
Commission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard for
hearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised a
technical standard for phones based on the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers can
turn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,
which can be a source of interference for some types of hearing
aids.

          According to panelists at the meeting, several devices are
available that enable hearing-impaired people to use digital
telephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for
example, can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-
coil" (t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the
hearing aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to
use the mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a
"JABRA" device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing
aids.

          George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,
said the availability of such devices does not mean the wireless
industry should stop developing other alternatives for people
with disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they
will pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some
22 million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and
there isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to
ignore 10% of the population."

          Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted its
responsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wireless
technologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs,
who wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientific
research will provide us with long-term solutions for resolving
electromagnetic compatibility issues."

          Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,
Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research and
development arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a Senior
Engineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)
transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aid
interference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude
modulated, he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with
mobile phones based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said,
adding that all PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude
modulation.  "Higher RF output increases the range of
interference, but that is why the FCC has set limits on output
levels," Mr. Williams said.

          Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering for
the Advanced Products and Technology Division of the Cellular
Subscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving from
the use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the
use of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will lead
manufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devices
that can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

Alcatel Wins Multimillion-Dollar PCS Contract

          Alcatel Network Systems has signed a "multimillion-dollar"
agreement with the Sprint Telecommunications Venture (STV) to
supply equipment and relocation services to incumbent licensees
operating microwave systems in the 2 gigahertz spectrum band.  An
Alcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but
he said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering
that Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS)
in up to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services,
Sprint must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbent
licensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.

          Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum
relocation projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last
year STV won PCS licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and
Indianapolis "Major Trading Areas" (TR, March 20, 1995).  Alcatel
plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment designed to
operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul equipment
interconnecting cell sites.

          Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell Mobile
Services, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipment
for the spectrum relocation of public safety wireless facilities
operated by the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  The Alcatel
spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend about $1 million
to relocate five microwave links for the county.  That estimate
is in line with other industry estimates, which put the cost of
relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.  Alcatel-
-which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees planning to
upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to announce similar
relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and BellSouth
Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He said there
is a roughly $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.

Washington Commission Clarifies Local Competition Rules

          Responding to requests by several potential local exchange
market entrants, the Washington Utilities and Transportation
Commission has amended rules for local exchange competition
adopted last November (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The potential local
exchange competitors had asked the commission to modify several
rule provisions and to clarify that GTE Northwest, Inc., is
required to file tariffs for unbundled local loop and number
portability offerings.  The commission denied requests that GTE
and US WEST Communications, Inc., be required to offer all of
their services for resale.

          In the November order, the commission had directed US WEST
to file an unbundled loop tariff, but that order had not
mentioned GTE.  In a Dec. 27 order, the commission clarified that
GTE also must file an unbundled loop tariff within 30 days.  The
tariff must offer line-side interconnection and two-wire
interconnection from an end-user's facility to the GTE central
office.  The commission also granted requests by Teleport
Communications Group, Inc., and Electric Lightwave, Inc., that it
require GTE to file an interim number portability tariff within
30 days.  Rates for that service must be set at GTE's incremental
costs.

          The commission said further network unbundling--beyond that
needed to make unbundled loops and line-side interconnection
available--likely will be necessary, but "an immediate need for
more extensive unbundling was not shown in this docket."  It
rejected requests from AT&T Corp. and MCI Telecommunications
Corp. that US WEST and GTE be directed to file a "generally
available tariff for any elements unbundled for any competitor in
response to a bona fide request."

          Competitors also had asked the commission to require that US
WEST offer a four-wire facility, rather than a two-wire facility,
for its unbundled network offerings.  They had argued that a two-
wire facility would limit the ability of competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs) to provide business and data services
and that four-wire facilities are needed to offer digital
services.  The commission said, however, that two-wire loops will
allow CLECs to serve the "vast majority of residential customers
and business customers without having to buy bundled [US WEST]
services or facilities."  

          AT&T and MCI also had asked the commission to require that
incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) remove all restrictions
on local exchange service resale.  The interexchange carriers
said their ability to compete in local exchange markets depends
on their ability to resell the incumbent LECs' bundled and
tariffed services.  US WEST had argued, meanwhile, that the
record in the proceeding did not support any action directing
LECs to offer all services for resale.  The commission ruled that
although the general prohibition on resale should be eliminated,
any such action should be considered as part of a general rate
case.

          AT&T called the commission's Dec. 27 order "another step
toward achieving the goal of widespread local competition in
Washington."  Greg Allen, AT&T Vice President-government affairs,
added, "Expanding competition in local telephone service is in
the public interest, since it will mean more features, faster
innovation and better value--all the things that customers
currently enjoy in the competitive long distance market."

US WEST Meets Colo. Party-Line Conversion Deadline

          Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, US
WEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-party
lines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  The
conversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission's
orders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities Improvement
Program (TR, Feb. 8, 1993; and Dec. 11, 1995).  The company
earlier had sought a waiver from the requirement, indicating that
it did not expect to complete the conversions last month.  The
PUC had been considering late last year whether to direct US WEST
to eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to recover the
cost of the conversions.  The rider charges on subscribers' bills
represent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a US WEST spokesman told
TR.  US WEST said its employees made an "extraordinary effort" to
complete the upgrades by Dec. 31.

Time Warner Seeks Mediation in Ameritech Talks

          Expressing frustration over Ameritech-Ohio's intransigence
in talks on interconnection terms, Time Warner Communications has
asked the Ohio Public Utilities Commission to mediate the
negotiations.  Time Warner said agreement has been reached on
"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snag
over "economic" issues.  Last summer the PUC gave Time Warner
authority to provide local exchange services in the 37 counties
where it operates cable TV systems (TR, Aug. 28, 1995).  Time
Warner requested PUC mediation in its second 60-day report to the
commission on the status of its interconnection negotiations with
Ameritech and other telephone companies.

          Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for Time
Warner, said negotiations with Ameritech began in December 1994. 
An interconnection agreement must be concluded "by the parties
with commission intervention, or by commission directive, by mid-
January 1996 or the promise of local telephone competition in
Ohio will be even further delayed," she said.  Ameritech appears
"unable or unwilling to negotiate" a reasonable resolution of the
remaining issues, Ms. Schermer said.

          In its request for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some
[Ameritech] charges for key services, for which there are not
current substitutes, are excessive."  Ameritech also has failed
to provide "cost justifications" and has proposed some one-time
charges that are "not appropriate," Time Warner added.  

          It appears that Ameritech's negotiating team, which
represents its Information Industry Services (AIIS) unit, is
"hindered by a lack of authority to revise and modify proposals,"
it told the commission.  Negotiations were "unilaterally
terminated" for several months in May 1995 by "someone at
Ameritech," Time Warner said, adding, "that decision did not
appear to be a decision of AIIS."

          In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by
"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriate
insistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a manner
which insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." 
Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remaining
issues, "if Time Warner is serious."

          It suggested that Time Warner may have other motives for
filing its mediation request.  James C. Smith, the telco's Vice
President, pointed to the "combination of Time Warner raising new
issues at the bargaining table, publicly complaining to the
[PUC], and conducting a media blitz."  Time Warner appears to be
employing a "tactic to create negative publicity" in an effort to
"stall finalization of our cable TV franchise agreement" in
Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Smith said.  Time Warner officials seem "more
intent on delaying competition in the cable TV market than
negotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can provide local
telephone service," he added.

Brooks Fiber, NYNEX Reach Interconnection Pact

          Brooks Fiber Communications has reached an interim agreement
to interconnect with NYNEX-New England's local exchange network
in Springfield, Mass.  The companies set reciprocal compensation
rates for call termination and agreed on an interim local number
portability arrangement.  The pact paves the way for Brooks to
offer local exchange service on an interim basis, pending the
development of permanent interconnection rules by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this year,
Brooks said.  The company plans to begin providing such service
in Springfield early this year.

          "The NYNEX co-carrier agreement was the last major hurdle in
providing local dial-tone [service] in Springfield," said Robert
J. Shanahan, Vice President-northern region for Brooks.  The
company already has a fiber optic network in place and has
ordered an AT&T 5ESS-2000 switch for installation there.  The
interconnection agreement mirrors three others signed by NYNEX
with competitive local exchange carriers in Massachusetts, a
NYNEX spokesman said.

Court Tells Pa. PUC To Rethink Price Cap Index

          A recent ruling by Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court on Bell
Atlantic-Pennsylvania's intrastate price cap plan could lead to
rate reductions for the telephone company's customers.  The court
overturned part of a Public Utility Commission order establishing
a price cap formula for Bell Atlantic, freeing the company from
rate-of-return regulation.  It ruled that the PUC had not taken
into account the difference between the general inflation rate
and the specific inflation rate for economic inputs used by the
telephone company.

          State Consumer Advocate Irwin Popowsky, among others, had
challenged the June 1994 commission order that established an
inflation "offset" factor of 2.93% for the telco's price cap
formula.  The commission's order forbade any rate increases
through 1999 and required the telco to reduce rates if the annual
inflation rate (as measured by the gross domestic product price
index, or GDP-PI) falls below 2.93%.  When the company eventually
is allowed to increase rates, those increases must be limited to
the GDP-PI minus 2.93%.  Rate decreases will continue to be
required whenever the GDP-PI is below 2.93%.

          The court, while rejecting some of the Consumer Advocate's
arguments for a higher offset factor, agreed in its ruling late
last month that the figure fails to reflect Bell Atlantic's
"input price differential."  The inflation rate for Bell
Atlantic's inputs is lower than the GDP-PI, Mr. Popowsky told TR. 
Although the PUC had agreed in principle that there was a
differential, it had not been able to determine the correct
figure.  So the commission effectively had set the differential
at zero by not accounting for it in calculating the offset
factor, Mr. Popowsky said.

          The PUC has not yet decided whether to appeal the court's
decision, commission attorney Alan Kohler said.  Other parties
that had challenged the commission's order include AT&T Corp.,
MCI Telecommunications Corp., the Pennsylvania Cable &
Telecommunications Association, the Central Atlantic Payphone
Association, and the city of Pittsburgh.

          Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service"
telecommunications provider, the company said.  Brooks
Telecommunications had owned 15% of Brooks Fiber, a company
spokesman said.

          The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and software
expertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth of
consultative support," according to James C. Allen, Chief
Executive Officer of the company.  Acquiring the domestic
consulting unit--dubbed GLA International, Inc.--will give Brooks
Fiber more "management information systems" (MIS) capabilities,
improving its ability to meet interexchange carrier (IXC)
customers' service requirements, Mr. Allen said.  IXCs have
"voiced perpetual disappointment with MIS shortcomings of the
older [local exchange carriers]," he added.  Brooks Fiber
"strongly supports GLA's incumbent senior management.  We have no
intentions of [implementing] significant changes in GLA's present
course, including current staffing levels," Mr. Allen said. 
Brooks Fiber now will have about 300 employees and could have
revenues of more than $40 million in 1996, the company said.

AT&T Slams RHCs' `Generic Me-Too' Waiver Pleas

          AT&T Corp. has opposed granting the Bell companies "generic
me-too" waivers that would extend to them all previous waivers of
the line-of-business restrictions contained in the 1982 antitrust
consent decree.  In a recent letter to the Justice Department's
Antitrust Division, AT&T said the Bell companies have made no
attempt to show that their requests for "wholesale" decree relief
do not raise "different factual and legal issues" than those
considered when the initial waivers were granted.  In many cases,
the original waivers were granted only because they were
justified for a particular Bell company in a particular
circumstance, AT&T said.

          Bell Atlantic Corp. filed the first generic me-too waiver
request late last year, seeking decree relief equal to that
granted by the U.S. District Court in Washington in all previous
waiver orders (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).  Bell Atlantic volunteered to
abide by all terms and conditions set by the court in those
orders.  Since then, several other Bell regional holding
companies (RHCs)--including BellSouth Corp., US WEST, Inc., SBC
Communications, Inc., and NYNEX Corp.--have sought the
department's support for similar waivers.

          Those companies "have simply asserted--without any analysis
or support--that the wholesale extension of all previously
approved waivers to them `does not raise any factual or legal
issues that are significantly different from those raised by the
previously approved waivers' themselves," AT&T told the
department.  "But [that] assertion is false."  

          Although it acknowledged that some Bell companies may be
justified in seeking me-too waivers in specific cases, AT&T
stated that many existing waivers were granted by the court
"solely because they would apply to only one" Bell company and
would not be extended to others.

          As an example, it cited the court's 1989 decision to allow
Pacific Telesis Group to acquire a 10% interest in a transpacific
cable system.  AT&T said that waiver likely would not have been
granted had the court believed that each of the seven RHCs later
would be allowed to obtain equal 10% shares, thus allowing them
collectively to control 70% of the cable system.  

          "Similarly, the prior waiver orders that authorized de
minimis foreign exchange or private line services across LATA
[local access and transport area] boundaries generally rested on
a ground unique to the [Bell company that] requested the waiver,"
AT&T added.

APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Interference Problems

          American Personal Communications has rejected claims that
its personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering
with the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a
recent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration
(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "serious
interference" to the communications operations of light rail and
bus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations. 
The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

          Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs,
expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to
"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to
other spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators has
been a contentious issue since the FCC first drafted rules
requiring 2 GHz licensees to clear that band to make way for new
PCS licensees (TR, Sept. 21, 1992; and July 19, 1993).  The
Commission recently clarified rules adopted in the Engineering
and Technology docket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding,
further defining "good faith" negotiations over relocation issues
between licensees (TR, Oct. 16, 1995).

          The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter
stated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs
incurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman
Anthony Brown declined to comment further on the interference
problems, noting that it involves "a possible issue of
litigation."

            Ms. Schelle told TR that interference problems with the
mass transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to
the MTA, an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have
reported no public-safety problems resulting from interference
between the two radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a
responsibility to respond to frequency coordination notices in a
timely manner, the attorney added.  

          The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that
APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials
failed to respond to a single one.

          "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are
informed of the complete parameters of those facilities'
operations.  APC fully protected the facilities represented on
MTA's FCC license and could not have known, without being
informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from those
parameters."

Federal Employees Expected To Return To Work;
FCC Issues Public Notice on Filing Deadlines

          Thousands of federal employees were expected to return to
work this week as congressional leaders took steps late last week
to approve a measure restoring the government's ability to pay
them.  About 280,000 federal employees had been furloughed, and
480,000 others had worked for three weeks without pay.  At TR's
Friday news deadline, the House passed, 401-17, a GOP-sponsored
"targeted continuing appropriations" measure (HR 1643) to end the
21-day partial government shutdown resulting from failed budget
negotiations between President Clinton and congressional leaders. 
The measure also was expected last Friday to receive Senate
approval and a Presidential signature.

          If enacted, the measure would allow employees to collect
current and back pay, but it would not provide the funding that
federal agencies need to operate.  Late Friday afternoon,
however, House leaders took up another proposal to fund
government operations through Jan. 26.  If enacted, that measure
will not take effect until President Clinton submits a balanced
budget proposal that has been "scored" by the Congressional
Budget Office.

          Earlier last week the House failed to override President
Clinton's veto of HR 2076, which would have provided fiscal year
1996 funding for the Commerce Department and other federal
agencies, including the FCC.  Lawmakers voted 240-to-159, falling
short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.

          The GOP measure adopted by the House last Friday represents
only a temporary truce in the ongoing budget battle.  It would
guarantee the payment of government workers' salaries through
Jan. 26, when another continuing resolution may be required. 
Office of Management and Budget officials told TR that the
Republican-sponsored measure would permit all furloughed
employees to return to work.  OMB also planned to furnish federal
agencies with guidelines specifying what activities those
employees could perform while appropriations bills are pending.

          Other government sources told TR that the FCC would be able
to conduct a substantial portion of its regular business
activities, despite the continuing appropriations lapse. 
"Basically, the FCC regulates, and that doesn't cost the
government anything," one source told TR.  The Commission should
be able to adopt orders and conduct rulemaking proceedings as
usual, the source said, adding that FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt
wants to proceed with its scheduled Jan. 18 public meeting.  That
meeting appeared to be in jeopardy as long as the partial
shutdown persisted, but the Chairman wants to conduct as much
business as possible once FCC staffers return to work, TR's
source said.

          Anticipating the government's reopening, the FCC Jan. 5
released a public notice revising document-filing deadlines.  All
documents due to be filed with the agency during the shutdown
"will be due no later than 5:30 p.m. on the second day after the
Commission reopens," the notice stated.  "Documents received
during the government shutdown via mail...will be deemed filed on
the first day that the Commission is authorized to reopen," it
stated.  Upcoming filing deadlines will remain in effect unless
the Commission or its bureaus decide otherwise, the notice added.

          GOP leaders predicted last Friday that the House would
approve the second resolution to fund the FCC, the Commerce
Department, and other federal agency operations.  That measure,
however, would not take effect until President Clinton submitted
a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) said last Friday.

          Meanwhile, the government spending freeze could remain in
effect this week.  And although federal employees are expected to
be paid their regular salaries through Jan. 26, government
contract workers are not covered under the measure restoring
federal workers' pay.  In effect, FCC employees could return to
work, but they may not be authorized to spend government money to
do their jobs.  It remained unclear at TR's deadline what
functions the employees would be able to perform under the
expected OMB guidelines.

          Harris Miller, President of the Information Technology
Association of America (ITAA), told President Clinton that the
interim GOP measure was "outrageous."  He said:  "While we are
pleased this proposal helps federal workers, the plan is both
short-sighted and unfair."  In a Jan. 5 letter he criticized
Congress for treating federal contractors as "second-class
citizens."  ITAA represents some 6,700 companies that provide
communications services to government agencies and private-sector
businesses.

          On Friday President Clinton renewed his pledge to submit a
balanced budget plan to Congress.  "I gave them my word I would
work with them to pass a plan which would bring our federal
budget into balance in seven years," he said as the House began
debating the plan to reopen parts of the government.  The
President said he was "ready" and "willing" to continue budget
negotiations with congressional leaders.

          While the FCC remained closed last week, "essential" staff
in the wireless bureau and several attorneys in the Office of the
General Counsel were working.  OMB previously had exempted staff
members in the wireless bureau's Auctions Division from the
shutdown.  Attorneys working on FCC briefs for cases pending in
federal courts also were deemed essential by OMB.

FCC AUCTION REVENUES CONTINUE GROWING

          The FCC's sale of radio licenses resumed last week despite
the federal government shutdown, which concluded its third week
last Friday.  The auction of "multipoint distribution service"
(MDS) licenses ended the week with net revenues of nearly $80
million.  Licenses for the New York, Washington, D.C., and
Fayetteville, N.C., markets attracted the highest bids.  The sale
of 900 megahertz "specialized mobile radio" (SMR) licenses
garnered more than $62.3 million in net bids.  

          The three most active markets were Charlotte, N.C.,
Philadelphia, and Tampa, Fla.  And net bids in the "C" block
auction of personal communications service (PCS) licenses totaled
$1.3 billion.  North Coast Mobile Communications, Inc., bid $225
million for the New York "Basic Trading Area," while
PersonalConnect Communications, Inc., bid more than $120 million
for the Los Angeles BTA and more than $75 million for the Chicago
BTA.

Arianespace Gears Up for Increased Launch Demand

          Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expected
increased demand for launch services in the coming years, a
company spokeswoman said last week.  Arianespace recently
unveiled plans to order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch
vehicles to meet the growing demand.  It plans to establish its
own finance company to help clients fund satellite launches, the
spokeswoman added.  Its insurance unit, S3R, also will be
reactivated to help market the Ariane 5, the company's more
powerful, next-generation rocket.

          Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches will
grow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  The
company plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70
satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans would
involve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. 
In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4
rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.

          The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergo
two technical verification flights in May and September of this
year, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially by
the end of the year if all goes well.  Meanwhile, fueling
problems on the launch of Malaysia's first national satellite,
MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9 launch date.  The
Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSat Corp.'s PanAmSat 3R
satellite.  A new launch date is expected to be announced this
week, the spokeswoman said.

S&P Revises Financial Guidelines for Wireless Companies

          Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising the
financial guidelines it applies to ratings of wireless
communications companies.  The business risks associated with
cellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to the
extent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial
ratios for the same credit ratings as companies in other
industries, S&P concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to
cellular and personal communications service (PCS) companies,
although PCS operators are expected to face many of the same
start-up risks as the early cellular companies.

          That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat worse-
than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringent
financial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited
dramatic growth in cellular subscribership as the reason that
business-risk profiles of cellular companies have improved.

          The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used
to assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom
companies that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These
include AT&T Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding
companies, and major independent telecom companies such as GTE
Corp.  "Although the wireless segment does not represent a
majority of these companies' assets, it is their fastest growing
segment," S&P observed.  "Under the revised benchmarks, companies
with significant cellular holdings are now viewed as being
somewhat less risky, while those with a major commitment to PCS
are viewed as still having significant credit risk for the PCS
portion of their wireless business." 

          S&P will use the following measurements to determine the
credit ratings of wireless communications companies:

          *  Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement of
income before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--that
indicates "earnings protection."

          *  EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement of
cellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relative
to total i nterest cost.  This measures a company's minimum
ability to meet interest costs using available cash.

          *  The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relative
to cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine
a company's debt "exposure" relative to cash flow.

          *  Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt to
total "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continue
to be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimate
generally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-
pop ratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.

          *  Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellular
subscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurement
of financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number of
subscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company's
revenues are used to service debt costs.

          In determining the business risk profile of wireless
carriers, S&P considers a number of market factors, including
capital intensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies,
economic conditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (which
measure the loss of subscribers to competitors), and the
unregulated nature of the industry.  For more information about
S&P's wireless financial guidelines, call Timothy E. Caffrey at
212/208-1750.

Pacific Bell Seeks Approval for ISDN Rate Hike

          Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities
Commission for permission to double the per-minute rates for its
integrated services digital network (ISDN) service and to add a
$125 installation fee.  The company said it needs the rate
increase--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the
"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly to
install and maintain the service.

          ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near central
offices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. 
But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet and
online services--along with increasing popularity of
telecommuting--has led to more residential installations.  The
company's current ISDN rates will remain in place pending the
PUC's decision, which could take six months or more, she added.

          ISDN service demand in California increased 200% during the
last 10 months, the spokeswoman said.  Pacific Bell has installed
about 60,000 ISDN lines in the state so far--about 30% of which
are in high-cost areas, she said.  A year ago only 5% of ISDN
installations were in high-cost areas (those three or more miles
from an ISDN-equipped central office).  By the year 2000, more
than 70% of California ISDN lines will be installed in
residential areas.  Pacific Bell must recoup its rising
installation costs, but it does not want to discourage potential
subscribers by implementing an even higher installation fee, the
spokeswoman said.  It also does not want to penalize residents of
high-cost areas by charging them more than it charges other ISDN
subscribers.

          In addition to implementing the $125 installation fee
throughout its service area, Pacific Bell would begin levying
per-minute charges during off-peak, night, and weekend hours.  It
plans to end its provision of free ISDN use in all off-peak time
periods, substituting a variety of service packages offering a
combination of free and billable usage at various times, the
spokewoman said.  "We want to place the maximum amount of control
for billing in the customer's hands."

S.C. Regulators OK Price Cap Plan for BellSouth

          In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public Service
Commission properly has "recognized the need" for alternative
regulation of local exchange carriers, a BellSouth official has
said.  Greg Morton, the company's Director-corporate and external
affairs for South Carolina, told TR, however, that a five-year
price freeze imposed on basic local service rates "is too long in
a competitive environment."  BellSouth had proposed a freeze of
only three years.  

          Mr. Morton added that BellSouth is "disappointed" that the
PSC included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its price cap
formula, which was adopted by the commission Jan. 2.  "We felt
our plan" as originally proposed "had a built-in productivity
factor," in that BellSouth could "never go back and recover"
revenues from price increases it was forbidden to make during the
freeze, he said.

          After the plan's fifth year, the company will be allowed to
increase basic service rates by an amount equal to the rate of
inflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  BellSouth's
intrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For
"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)
services, the company will have pricing flexibility, subject to a
10% annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintain
oversight authority and can refuse to allow rate increases, Mr.
Morton emphasized.

          BellSouth most likely will ask the commission to reconsider
parts of its decision regarding the productivity factor and the
five-year price freeze, he said.  He noted, however, that the
company has not reviewed the PSC's order yet, which has not been
released publicly yet.  BellSouth currently faces no basic local
exchange service competition in South Carolina, but there are
competitive providers of access and short-haul toll services, Mr.
Morton said.  Callers must use "dial-around" access codes to
reach BellSouth's competitors in the state's intraLATA (local
access and transport area) toll service market.

Intelsat Will Consider Restructuring Plan This Year

          By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have
"a better idea of the future structure" of the international
satellite consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-
international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat
Corp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.
Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the
board took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  A special
Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee" of the board
are exploring the future structure of the consortium, he
explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--
after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on
the board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the
"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.

          As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The
board will review the support centers' performance at its March
1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open any
additional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  Plans for improving
customer service also include restructuring Intelsat's sales and
marketing division and establishing new internal accounting
processes, he added.

          The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A
series satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A
satellites will be deployed in February, and the last bird in the
series will be deployed later this year.  Work by Lockheed Martin
Corp. on the VIII series of satellites continues, and the board
recently approved a "minor modification" of the contract with
Lockheed that "won't affect the scheduled delivery," he added.

          The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805
satellite to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While
the current design of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides
sufficient land mass coverage over all of Africa, intersystem
coordination constraints may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805
satellite at 33 degrees East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained. 
At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March 14-19,
the board will consider releasing a request for proposals for two
new satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellites
covering the Indian Ocean region, he said.

          Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said the
board approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876
million in total revenues and $496 million in capital
expenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase in
revenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995
budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenues
totaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000

Sprint Shareholders To Vote on Phoenix Deal 

          Sprint Corp. shareholders will meet Jan. 12 at the company's
Westwood, Kan., corporate headquarters to vote on three proposals
to consummate Sprint's alliance with France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom AG.  The "Phoenix" global services alliance won FCC
approval last month (TR, Dec. 18, 1995).  The deal calls for
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to invest $4.2 billion in
return for a 20% stake in Sprint.  Shareholders have been asked
to approve the investment agreement, related changes to Sprint's
charter and bylaws, and certain "control share acquisitions"
requirements under Kansas state law.  A Sprint official told TR
that the meeting should last only a few minutes because of
expected overwhelming approval of the company's proxy proposals.

Consumer Groups Want Conditions on Time Warner Deal

          Several consumer groups plan jointly to ask the FCC to
attach "severe conditions" on any regulatory approval related to
the proposed merger of Time Warner, Inc., and Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. (TR, Sept. 25 and Oct. 16, 1995).  The groups are
concerned that the proposed "mega-merger," which would create one
of the world's largest media companies, could result in excessive
media company concentration.  They are also worried that it could
limit video programming diversity.

          The request is contained in comments on an earlier, similar
request by the U.S. Telephone Association (TR, Dec. 11, 1995). 
The comments were prepared by the Media Access Project (MAP) on
behalf of the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for
Media Education.  The groups intended to file their comments last
week at the FCC; they will be submitted, instead, as soon as the
partial federal government shutdown concludes.  The groups
reiterated concerns raised in USTA's "request for imposition of
conditions."  They said Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) should
not be allowed to use its ownership stake in Turner Broadcasting
for anticompetitive purposes.  TCI is the nation's largest cable
TV company.  The groups also proposed that the FCC hold an en
banc hearing on issues raised by the proposed merger.

          The groups specifically are requesting that the FCC impose
conditions to ensure programming diversity and access and to
guard against anticompetitive conduct.  But they did not specify
exactly what form those conditions should take.  Conditions could
be attached to any television license transfers that must be
approved by the FCC for the transaction to be finalized, a MAP
source explained.  The FCC also may have the authority to impose
conditions on the provision of cable TV-related services by a
newly merged company, he added.

Court Should Consider Mtel License Separately, FCC Says

          The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
that it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme for
private paging licensees in its deliberations on whether Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a
license obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"
program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.
94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission's
authority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's
narrowband personal communications service (PCS) license without
first receiving congressional authority (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).

          During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a
licensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly
allocated frequency band," the agency explained, adding that all
other licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid
substantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.

          The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an
advanced two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge,
Mtel did not apply for a private paging license at 929-930
[megahertz]," it said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit
substantial amounts of money to its narrowband PCS licenses when
private paging licenses were `free' undercuts its assertion in
this court that the Commission is applying different rules to
identical licenses," the agency added.

AT OUR DEADLINE. . .

          ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED -- Unysis Corp. is expected to make an
announcement Monday, Jan. 8, regarding a "strategic" alliance to
provide telephone network management services.  Unysis would not
release details by TR's Friday news deadline, but a company
spokesman said Unysis will unveil a system to provide "real-time
network monitoring by capturing information from the Signalling
System No. 7 database" used in domestic telephone networks.  

          The major application for such a system, the company said,
is to detect phone fraud "as it is happening."  See today's
TRDaily for a full report on the alliance.

          COMPANY SEEKS AUCTION STAY -- CTA, Inc., of Rockville, Md.,
asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington to issue a stay
barring the FCC from proceeding with a Jan. 24 auction of two
construction permits for building and operating a direct
broadcast satellite (DBS) system (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).

          The company argued that the FCC has failed to consider steps
to encourage small business participation in the auction.  The
Appeals Court is expected to rule on the request before Jan. 19,
the date specified by the FCC for auction participants to submit
"upfront" payments.

          ALLTEL EXECUTIVE RETIRES -- ALLTEL Corp. said John E.
Steuri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of its ALLTEL
Information Services subsidiary, will retire May 31.  Mr. Steuri
has been CEO of the information services company since 1988. 
Formerly known as Systematics Information Services, the company
was acquired by ALLTEL in 1990.
