<h2>Chapter Three: The Experience of Foreign Countries and Drug
Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that the experiences of
countries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland
prove the efficacy of legalizing or decriminalizing various types
of illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. They
maintain that because such drugs are legal, these countries have
fewer addicts and less drug-related crime. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The statements of the legalizers here are empirically untrue.
As we discuss each country in turn, it will be shown that
legalization did not work in any of them. </p>

<p><b>A. Great Britain</b> </p>

<p>With the report of a government commission known as the Brain
Committee of 1964, England instituted a policy whereby doctors
could prescribe heroin so long as they followed certain treatment
criteria.47 Previously in England, doctors could prescribe heroin
much like any other opiate (such as morphine). This allowed a few
unscrupulous doctors to sell ungodly amounts of heroin to members
of the black market.48 Consequently, it was believed that if
heroin were offered at medical clinics according to stringent
rules and regulations, addicts would come to these clinics to
seek treatment and eventually would overcome their habit. </p>

<p>As of 1983, however, England began to phase out these programs
of clinically supplied heroin in favor of methadone treatment.49
Why? First, according to the reputable British physician journal <u>Lancet</u>,
the number of addicts increased 100% between 1970 and 1980.50 A
disproportionate number of these new addicts were between the
ages of sixteen and seventeen.51 Second, only twenty percent of
all of the addicts in England belonged to the clinical
programs.52 At first blush, this fact seems strange - why would
addicts choose not to participate in a program wherein they get
free methadone? The answer probably lies in the fact that
methadone does not produce the high that heroin does. Also,
addicts probably did not care for the mandatory treatment and
rehabilitation facets of the clinical programs. Whatever the
reason, by 1985 England had 80,000 heroin addicts, the vast
majority of whom wen not in treatment.53 </p>

<p>A third reason why England began to abolish its clinical
heroin program was the fact that not only were there few people,
in them, but the programs themselves did not work. According to
the <u>British Medical Journal</u>, more addicts left the program
because of criminal convictions than because of treatment.54
Fourth, even with the clinical programs, heroin addicts had a
death rate twenty-six times the average population. Finally, even
when the programs were in operation, Scotland Yard had to
increase its narcotics division 100% in order to cope with the
increased crime rate.56 </p>

<p>To summarize, the British experience with decriminalized
heroin in the clinical context was a dismal failure. When experts
from British Columbia were debating whether to create a similar
program, they made the following conclusions that are so
important as to deserve to be quoted at length: </p>

<p>While some success is claimed in terms of reducing the
incidence of young users, the following findings have also been
noted: </p>

<p>1) The British approach has failed to attract a majority of
addicts; </p>

<p>2) Many registered addicts continue to turn to illicit sources
of </p>

<p>drugs; </p>

<p>3) Many registered addicts do not decrease their dosage over
time; </p>

<p>4) Many registered addicts continue to be involved in criminal
activity; </p>

<p>5) Many registered addicts are chronically unemployed or do
not earn enough to look after themselves; </p>

<p>6) The death rate of registered addicts is much higher than
that of the general population and may be higher than that of
North American addicts; </p>

<p>7) Since 1960, there has been a dramatic increase in the
English addict population; </p>

<p>8) The black market for heroin continues to thrive; </p>

<p>9) Law enforcement appears to remain a necessary, costly and
complex control measure. </p>

<p>In view of the above, it is felt that the application of the
British approach to British Columbia would present serious
dangers.57 </p>

<p><b>B. The Netherlands</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization almost certainly would cite
Amsterdam as the drug Mecca of the Western world. Anyone may go
into the restaurants in this city and order marijuana and hashish
from a menu; further, heroin and cocaine have been decriminalized
for all practical purposes. The police simply leave the users
alone. Consequently, health officials estimate that Amsterdam has
7,000 addicts, 20% of whom are foreigners.58 These addicts are
responsible for 80% of all property crime in the city, thus
necessitating that Amsterdam maintain a police presence far
greater than those of cities of comparable size in the United
States.59 </p>

<p>The Dutch have not raised one dollar in tax revenue from drug
sales, and drug violators account for 50 percent of the Dutch
prison population, a higher proportion than in the United
States.60 The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation in
Europe and most drug addicts live on state welfare payments and
by committing crimes.61 Nationwide, the number of reported crimes
increased to 1.3 million in 1992 from. 812,000 in 1981.62 Faced
with public disgust at home over soaring drug related crime and
pressure from other European Community countries to strengthen
drug laws, Dutch authorities are implementing an aggressive
program to reduce drug-linked crimes and disturbances and show
new teeth in combatting illegal drug sales.63 Eberhard van der
Laan, leader Of the Social Democrats in the Amsterdam City
Council says, &quot;People are absolutely fed up with all the
troubles caused by drug addicts - car windows broken, noise,
whole streets almost given up to the drug problem.&quot;64
Legalization advocates claim that marijuana use in Netherlands
has not increased since the laws were liberalized, but the number
of Amsterdam drug cafes rose from 30 to over 300 in one decade.
They also fail to note that daily marijuana use by U.S. youth has
declined by 75 percent.65 </p>

<p><b>C. Switzerland</b> </p>

<p>Much like Amsterdam, Switzerland until recently followed a
policy of decriminalization. Indeed, a city park in the town of
Zurich for many years was allowed to be a haven for drug users -
police simply would ignore the problem by claiming that it was
better to have all the addicts in one place rather than having
them roam throughout the entire city.66 Unsurprisingly, in
February of 1992 Switzerland ended this experiment with
decriminalization after experiencing an unacceptable increase in
use, violence, crime and health costs and consequences.67
Specifically, the number of addicts residing at the park (called
Platzspitz) jumped from a few hundred in 1987 to over 20,000, by
early 1992.68 Approximately 20% of these addicts were foreigners
who came to Zurich to take advantage of the city's lax drug
laws.69 In deciding to close the park, city officials cited the
increased incidence of crime and prostitution--as Andres Oehler,
a municipal spokesperson stated, &quot;it was felt that the
situation had got out of control in every sense.&quot;70 </p>

<p><b>D. Spain</b> </p>

<p>Since 1983 in Spain, it has been legal to use, but not sell,
cocaine and heroin. Recently, however, </p>

<p>Spanish officials have begun a crack-down on drug pushers due
to a dramatic increase in the addiction rate.71 Unsurprisingly,
Spain and Italy, which also legalized use of cocaine and heroin,
have the highest rates of both drug use and overdose of all
European countries.72 </p>

<p><b>E. China</b> </p>

<p>Lest we forget the lessons of history, consider that in the
late 1800's, opium was legal in China. By 1900, ninety million
Chinese were addicted to the drug, and it took fifty years of
repressive police measures and rehabilitation to correct the
problem.73 Today, opium and other addictive drugs are illegal.74 </p>

<p><b>F. Japan</b> </p>

<p>In the 1950's, Japan was faced with an epidemic of amphetamine
use that created half a million addicts. Through socialization
and policies aimed at both reducing supply and <u>demand</u>, the
number of addicts was decreased to a few thousand within four
years.75 A heroin epidemic involving thousands of addicts was
dealt with successfully in the 1960's using the same measures. 76
</p>

<p><b>G. Other countries</b> </p>

<p>Throughout recent history, numerous other countries have
attempted legalizing or decriminalizing drugs, all meeting with
the same harmful results. In Egypt in the 1920's, an unrestricted
supply of cocaine and heroin created an epidemic that eventually
resulted in the strict prosecution of all addicts.77 In Thailand
and Iran, countries that traditionally have had cheap and
unrestricted sources of narcotics, the addiction rates have been
and continue to be high.78 Finally, the Republic of Singapore had
to resort to strict law enforcement and mandatory rehabilitation
in order to overcome a heroin epidemic.79 </p>

<p>Given the experiences of countries such as Great Britain,
Switzerland, The Netherlands, China, Japan, Spain, Egypt, Iran,
and Thailand, it is little wonder why countries that
traditionally have had lenient drug laws are all moving in the
direction of illegalization. Undoubtedly, the danger that drug
legalization presents was foremost on the minds of the numerous
countries - the United States included - that signed the Single
Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971. And such danger also is why the
International Narcotics Control Board for the United Nations
concluded in 1992 that &quot;legalization advocates have not yet
presented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or viable
alternative to the present system of international drug abuse
control.&quot;80 </p>

<p>The addiction rates for heroin in Great Britain increased 100%
in ten years, and many of the new addicts were children between
the ages of sixteen and seventeen. [Letter from John Lawn to
Joseph E. DiGenova, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Drug Enforcement

Health, Alcohol and Drug Commission, April 1978]. </p>

<p>More addicts left the British program because of criminal
convictions than because of rehabilitation. [Letter of John Lawn,

<p>Heroin addicts in Britain had mortality rates 26 times higher
than that of the average population. [Letter of John Lawn,

legalize drugs without any problems. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>The Amsterdam health officials state that the 7,000 addicts in
the city are responsible for 80% of the property crime. (Ramon
Bracamontes, &quot;Marijuana is as easy to buy as ice
cream,&quot; El Paso Times, July 24, 1988]. </p>

<p>Because of its drug problem, Amsterdam is required to have a
police force much greater than those of U.S. cities of similar
population. [Ramon Bracamontes, citation above]. </p>

<p>The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation in Europe and
most drug addicts live on state welfare payments and by
committing crimes. [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Legalization: The
Myth Exposed&quot; in &quot;Searching for Alternatives: Drug

<p>Amsterdam is rethinking its liberal drug policies because of
the social ills that result there from. [Robert E. Peterson,

<p>As of February 1992, Switzerland officially rejected its
policy of decriminalization. [Roger Cohen, &quot;Amid Growing
Crime, Zurich Closes a Park It Reserved for Drug Addicts,&quot;
New York Times, February 11, 1992]. </p>

<p>Allowing a city park to be used as a &quot;drug
legalized&quot; area of Zurich, the number of addicts escalated
from a few hundred to over 20,000 within several years. [Roger
Cohen, citation above]. </p>

<p>Swiss officials now admit that their policy of
legalization-decriminalization served to increase crime,
especially property crimes and prostitution. [Roger Cohen,

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>Spain successfully legalized both cocaine and heroin. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>Spain, and Italy, the two European countries that legalized
use of both cocaine and heroin, have the highest rates of both
addiction and overdose in all of Europe. [Gabriel G. Nahas,
&quot;A Battle Won, a Stalemated War and A New Strategy,&quot;
(position paper)]. </p>

<p>Spain recently has begun a crack-down on drug pushers in the
hopes of decreasing addiction and crime. [Robert E. Peterson,

<p>Historically, countries that have legalized or decriminalized
drugs have not been harmed. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>When opium was legal in China at the turn of the century,
there were 90 million addicts, and it took China fifty years to
eventually solve the problem. [Gabriel G. Nahas, &quot;The
Decline of Drugged Nations,&quot; The Wall Street Journal, July
11, 1988]. </p>

<p>In the 1950's Japan had an epidemic of amphetamine addiction
that it solved within four years by both police enforcement and
rehabilitation. [Gabriel G. Nahas, citation above]. </p>

<p>When Egypt allowed unrestricted trade of cocaine and heroin in
the 1920's, an epidemic of addiction resulted. [Gabriel G. Nahas,
citation above]. </p>

<p>In Iran and Thailand, countries where drugs are readily
available, the prevalence of addiction has been and continues to
be exceptionally high. [David T. Courtwright, &quot;Should We
