SCAR is the single international, interdisciplinary, non-governmental organization which can draw on the
experience and expertise of an international mix of scientists across the complete scientific spectrum. It is,
therefore, the obvious source of advice on a wide range of scientific questions and it is ideally placed to
provide the answers. For over 30 years SCAR has provided such scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty
System and made numerous recommendations on a variety of matters, most of which have been
incorporated into Antarctic Treaty instruments. Foremost amongst these have been the advice provided for
the many international agreements which provide protection for the ecology and environment of Antarctica.
<P>
<H2>Origins of SCAR</H2>

The plans for the IGY, the International Geophysical Year, 1957-58, included a major Antarctic
component. ICSU set up a Special Committee on Antarctic Research to coordinate the scientific research of
the twelve nations which were active in Antarctica during this period. The unprecedented success of the
IGY led to the establishment of the ICSU Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the
development of the Antarctic Treaty. 
<P.
ICSU was created in 1931 to promote international scientific activity in the different branches of science and
their applications for the benefit of humanity. It is a non-governmental organization with two categories of
membership: scientific academies or research councils which are national, multidisciplinary bodies, and
Scientific Unions, which are international disciplinary organizations. ICSU has a number of
interdisciplinary scientific committees of which SCAR is one. 

<H2>Membership of SCAR</H2>

The membership of SCAR comprises the National Committees of those national scientific academies or
research councils which are the adhering bodies to ICSU and which are, or plan to be, active in Antarctic
research, together with the relevant scientific Unions of ICSU. It includes the original twelve national
members and an increasing number of subsequent members. There are two categories of membership: Full
Members, including seven ICSU scientific Unions and countries which have an active research
programme in Antarctica, and Associate Members for those countries without an independent research
programme as yet or which are planning a research programme in the future. 

<H2>Organization of SCAR</H2>

SCAR meets every two years to conduct its administrative business at the SCAR Delegates Meeting. At these
meetings the members of SCAR, through their appointed Delegates, are responsible for approving SCAR
finances, and formulating SCAR policy and strategy. They also elect an Executive Committee from among
themselves which is responsible for the day-to-day administration of SCAR though its Secretariat at the
Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England. The scientific business of SCAR is conducted by its
Working Groups which represent the scientific disciplines active in Antarctic research and report to SCAR.

<H2>Operation of SCAR</H2>

The members of the SCAR Working Groups are nationally appointed representatives who elect a Chief
Officer from among themselves. The Working Group is the international forum for discussing national
plans, progress and achievements in that particular discipline. Free and open discussions allow national
scientific programmes to be internationally co-ordinated and may lead to proposals for international
programmes to be developed. Such proposals are then submitted to the next biennial SCAR Delegates
meeting. 
<P>
Groups of Specialists are created by SCAR in response to specific scientific problems. The members of a
Group of Specialists are appointed by SCAR for the experience and expertise they can bring to the Group.
Most Groups of Specialists have a limited life-span, normally not more than 10 years, during which time
they will be expected to have completed their appointed task. A Group of Specialists may develop a appointed
task. A Group of Specialists may develop a programme of research which national members of SCAR, as
appropriate, will put into effect, co-ordinated by the Group. Some Groups of Specialists, such as those on
Antarctic Seals and on Environmental Affairs and Conservation, may have a longer life span to monitor a
particular aspect and to provide advice and make recommendations on a continuing basis. Such advice and
recommendations will normally be passed through SCAR to the appropriate outside bodies, typically the
Antarctic Treaty System including the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) and the
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). 
<P>
Although funded only by small national contributions, SCAR activities provide the key framework for the
very large expeditions and expenditure involved in the operation of national and multi-national research
programmes. SCAR also sponsors major international symposia, conferences and workshops on Antarctic
science which provide additional fora for the presentation of data and results, and for the discussion of
Antarctic science among a wider audience. The proceedings or reports of these meetings are usually
published. 

<H2>Future plans</H2>

SCAR will continue to initiate, promote and co-ordinate Antarctic scientific research and to provide
scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System. It will also continue to provide input to relevant
programmes of ICSU and other organizations, for example the World Climate Research Programme
(WCRP), a joint programme between ICSU and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). SCAR is
currently planning a major contribution to the ICSU International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme
(IGBP) which is concerned with global, particularly climate, change. SCAR is preparing six core
programmes to address those aspects of IGBP where the Antarctic region is uniquely placed to provide
fundamental data on global changes. These include studies of ozone depletion and the associated effects of
increased ultra-violet radiation, atmosphere and ocean exchanges of greenhouse gases, changes in the
Antarctic ice sheet and sea level, the history of climate change recorded in ice cores and ocean sediments. 
<P>
The current trend of Antarctic research is towards large, multi-national programmes which, due to the
increasing complexity and costs of Antarctic logistics, are the only way to address the major scientific
problems in Antarctica. Nevertheless, there is still a vast range of individual topical research projects being
undertaken nationally alongside but outside of the major international research programmes. 
<P>
As its record shows, SCAR is also committed to the conservation of the ecosystems and environment of
Antarctica, and to the freedom to continue to conduct scientific research in the south polar regions.
