The choice is yours!
<P>
Do you use your Kemper fund account as a way to systematically
pay your mortgage or other regular bill?
<P>
Do you systematically exchange from one Kemper fund to another?
<P>
Kemper Funds has improved capability to accommodate your needs.
Thanks to recent technological advancements, we can be more flexible
about processing your requests on the date you desire.
<P>
Now! Our <A HREF="forms.html">systematic withdrawal plan</A>, a transaction previously
processed on the 25th of every month, is available on any date
you choose*.
<P>
<I>You choose</I> the frequency -- monthly, quarterly, semiannually,
annually or any months you'd like -- with which you want regular
cash withdrawals from your account. You <I>choose</I> the amount
-- which could be a fixed dollar amount, a fixed percentage of
your account or an equal amount sufficient to deplete your account
within the number of years or months you stipulate**. Systematic
withdrawals can be mailed to you or, <I>if you choose</I>, deposited
into your financial institution account.
<P>
<I>*Systematic withdrawal plans are not available for Kemper
Target Equity Funds.</I> 
<P>
<I>**For Class B shares and C shares purchased after April 1,
1996, no more than 10 percent of your current account value may
be redeemed on an annual basis.</I> 
<P>
Now! <A HREF="forms.html">Systematic exchanges</A>, transactions previously processed only
on the 10th of every month, are now available on any date you
choose.
<P>
<I>You choose</I> the frequency -- monthly, quarterly, semiannually,
annually -- with which you want a sum from one Kemper fund transferred
into another Kemper Fund***. You <I>choose</I> the amount -- which
could be a fixed dollar amount, a fixed percentage of your account
or an equal amount sufficient to deplete your account within the
number of years or months you stipulate. Sums can be systematically
exchanged from one Kemper fund into one or more Kemper funds.
<P>
<I>***Please note that a minimum balance of $1,000 is required
in both the &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from&quot; accounts. The
exchange amount must be at least $100.</I> 
<P>
Now! You <I>choose</I> the start and stop dates for when you'd
like to systematically purchase (through a <A HREF="forms.html">direct deposit</A> from
a financial institution account, for example) shares of your Kemper
fund, when you'd like to systematically redeem shares and when
you'd like to stop one transaction and initiate another.
<P>
To establish either the systematic withdrawal or systematic exchange
feature on your Kemper account, you'll need to complete a form,
which you can <A HREF="forms.html">download now</A>. Or, call Shareholder Services
at 1-800-621-1048.
