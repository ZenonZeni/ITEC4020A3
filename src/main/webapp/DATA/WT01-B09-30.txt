<a href="/image/arpaw94f.gif"><img border = 0 align=right src="/image/arpaw94f1.gif"></a><blockquote><b><i>RACING TOWARD THE FUTURE -- Live on ESPN, the Notre Dame formula lightning race car whips around the fourth corner turn at Indianapolis Raceway Park in August 1994.  The  Electricore Inaugural Formula Lightning Race was the nation's first televised electric automobile race.</i></b></blockquote><br clear=all><br><p>

<img align=left src="/image/arpaw94g.gif"><blockquote><b><i>"When we gave Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt the keys to a clean electric tram at a wildlife refuge, we were expanding the market niche uses of advanced transportation vehicles.  Electricore is working to keep opening people's eyes about what's possible now."  -- Ellen G. Engleman Executive Director, Electricore</i></b></blockquote><br clear=all><br><p>



<blockquote><b>While the 'Silicon Valley' may be in 
			California,<br>the 'electric fields' will 
			be based on Mid-America."  </b></blockquote><p>


So state the goals of Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle consortium.  Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Electricore's participants from 17 states seek to help U.S. automakers reach the critical mass needed to successfully introduce electric vehicles in the region where many of these vehicles may first be built.<p>
Electricore is closely allied with industry participants which include the recently announced AC Delco Systems merger of Delco Remy and AC Rochester to focus on EV/hybrid vehicle technology and alternative fuels.  In addition, General Motors has formed Delco Propulsion Systems, based in Indianapolis, consisting of AC Delco Systems, Allison Transmission and Delco Electronics to coordinate the development of components and propulsion systems and offer sales and marketing of EV batteries, motors and related systems.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Electricore Mission</FONT></h3><p>
Electricore is committed to rapidly developing and deploying electric vehicle technology  and products both at home and abroad.  It seeks to create thousands of jobs in Mid-America, significantly improve the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions and, as EVs become a major part of the American transportation system, reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.  <p>
Serving as a technology catapult, Electricore is also a successful economic development tool for the region, partnering technological and manufacturing expertise in the unique partnership with ARPA. Over $8 million worth of projects are now being developed with ARPA.  Additional opportunities are now being considered in excess of $10 million.<p>
Electricore pulls together the managerial and technical expertise of its participants, which range from small start-up companies to major corporate manufacturing entities.  While Electricore's manufacturing partners focus on the development of technology for EVs, its utility partners, like the rest of ARPA-supported consortia nationwide, work to design and develop the appropriate infrastructure needed to support the vehicles, whether they be cars trucks or buses for military and commercial applications.<p>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
Electricore's accomplishments include:<p><ul>
<li> Partnering with General Motors EV technicians, Electricore worked to establish a land speed record for EVs over 1,000 kg.  Using the GM Impact automobile and AC Delco Systems batteries, the car surpassed all expectations when it achieved a closed course land-speed record of 183.075 mph;<p>
<li> The Cleveland Electric Formula Classic was won by the University of Notre Dame electric formula race car, sponsored by AC Delco Systems. Utilizing advanced technology and batteries, the race car won the pole position with an 85.8 mph lap speed and hit a top speed of 110 mph, winning over 15 other university entries;<p>
<li> Electricore provided a specially designed, all electric tram to the Department of the Interior for use in the Patuxent Wildlife Refuge in Maryland.  The first of its kind, this quiet, non-polluting all-electric vehicle will be used in areas which are environmentally sensitive and contain species on the endangered list.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
Electricore plans to deploy 15 mid-size electric powered pickup trucks and electric and hybrid electric buses.  Seven trucks will be field tested at both the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division in Indiana and at the Tank Automotive Command base in Michigan.  The hybrid electric powered shuttle buses will be evaluated in real life, real time testing situations in Indianapolis, Indiana and Chattanooga, Tennessee.<p>
Electricore has also created a unique educational program called "Teach the Technology" which partners engineers and students grades 5-12 and in universities to demonstrate the advantages of EV technology and interest students in engineering and EV-related technology careers in science, math, engineering and manufacturing.<p>
Electricore is negotiating with two major cities to use electric vehicle transportation for public transit activities and is expanding its community outreach to increase public awareness of EV technology and its benefits through enhanced communication with government officials, community leaders and economic development specialists.<p><ul>
