<dl>
<DT><B>How long have you been in business?</B>
<DD>The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP)  has been in business since 1980.
<P>
<DT><B>How many births have you had?</B>
<DD>CSP is proud of our over 428 births as of December 1995, and  we currently have 36 ongoing pregnancies (41 babies due).  In 1994 we celebrated 67 births!
<P>
<dt><B>What programs do you offer?</B>

</UL>
<P>
<DT><B>What are the advantages of a fully comprehensive program?</B>
<DD>CSP approaches surrogacy as a team effort. The professionals
involved have worked together for many years, and with many hundreds of clients.
Each person is able to voice their opinions, brainstorm with the other
professionals, and decide what will be in the best interest of the couples
involved. In our program, it is not just one persons opinion that counts.
<P>Every week the entire staff meets to discuss activity on every clients'
file. We feel this time spent together sets us apart from other programs.
This is a strength and indicative of our commitment to our couples. Each
professional brings a different perspective, allowing more in-depth coverage
of cases and preventing details and issues from being missed.
<P>
<DT><B>Have you ever had a surrogate mother change her mind and keep the baby?</B>
<DD>No, in our over 428 births, we have never had a surrogate mother change her mind. The actual number of cases gone to court are less than 17 in
the entire country, but none of these have come from our program.
<P>
<DT><B>How do I finalize my parental rights?</B>
<DD>Couples are represented by independent legal counsel. We hold your
hand throughout the process, and no couple in our program has ever failed
to finalize their parental rights, regardless of the State the couples resides
in.
<P>
In the Artificial Insemination program, the surrogate mother's name and the Natural/Intended Father's name appears on the birth certificate.  The couples then returns to their state of residence and competes the step-parent adoption needed to finalize the Intended Mother's legal parental rights.
<P>
In the In Vitro Fertilization program, the names of the natural father and natural mother (the couple who donates their egg and sperm), will appear on the original birth certificate.
<P>
<DT><B>Are surrogates and donors medically and psychologically screened?</B>
<DD>Both couples and surrogate mothers and their husbands, or egg donors and their husbands, are medically and psychologically screened In our program.
<P>
<DT><B>How am I matched? and Will I meet my surrogate?</B>
<DD>Once a surrogate mother has been psychologically and medically screened,  completed her criminal background search and has medical insurance in effect, she is ready to be presented with couple's profiles to begin the selection process.
Generally a surrogate mother will receive 2-3 profiles of couples.
If she selects a couple, her profile is mailed to that couple for their consideration.
A couple could therefore receive one, or two or more profiles, depending on whether they were selected by a surrogate mother.
Couples then have the opportunity to review the profile(s), knowing they have already been selected by the surrogate mother(s).
The counselors are on hand to assist couples in the selection process.
If none of the profiles are acceptable to the couple, their information is sent to other surrogate mothers and the process continues.
Through our selection process you are only presented with candidates that meet our requirements and are finished with their screening process.
Most of the applicants do not pass the screening process, and their profiles are NOT presented to couples.
Basically, we do not believe in presenting a couple with a hypothetical	 candidate.
CSP recognizes that couples have been through a lot, and we are cautious to protect couples.
<P>CSP is an "open" program.  This means that couples will meet their surrogate mother prior to any medical procedures being undertaken.
Our selection process allows surrogates to select her couple and couples to select their surrogate mother.
The final choice regarding selection is the couples!
We consider it to be our responsibility to your child to ensure that he/she fits in with the "look" of your family and that you feel very positively about your surrogate mother.
By giving you the final say as to whom you are matched with, gives you the power to decide what is in your best interests.  
<P>Couples participate in the pregnancy as much as is comfortable for them.  Most couples try to attend some doctor appointments and all couples are present for the birth of their baby.
<P>
<DT><B>Is a trust account established? What if my surrogate mother asks for
additional funds?</B>
<DD>CSP is the administrator of the contract and deals with all the financial issues, taking the burden away from the couple.  This allows the couple and the surrogate mother to concentrate on the pregnancy, and prevent any awkward conversations regarding finances or reimbursements. 
<P>CSP is very concerned about protecting our couples and surrogate mothers.  We hold full trust funds sufficient to cover expenses throughout the pregnancy.  Physicians and surrogate mothers are therefore guaranteed their fees.  Should a couple file for bankruptcy, divorce or both die, while their surrogate mother is pregnant, she will not be left with any bills.  All payments are guaranteed for the trust account.
<P>Compensation is very clearly dictated by the contract which is signed by both the couple and the surrogate mother and her husband.  All parties are represented by independent legal counsel and therefore all Parties have a clear understanding of the financial considerations and have expressly agreed to abide to these considerations in writing.
<P>Each month the Intended Parents will receive a ledger detailing the financial activity in their account.  CSP has a Trust Administrator whose responsibility it is to administer clients trust funds, verify and process surrogate mother's expenses and doctor's bills.
<P>
<DT><B>How many staff members do you have?</B>
<DD>CSP has eight staff members and we work closely with four full-time independent counselors, and couple's independent legal counsel.  All staff members are cross-trained, therefore if one staff member is ill, or takes a vacation, the other staff members can take over the case.  Our weekly staff meetings enables each staff member to keep abreast of the status of each client.
<P>
<DT><B>What is your screening process for surrogate mothers?</B>
<DD>Potential surrogate mothers go through a three to five month evaluation, including psychological testing, interviews, genetic evaluation, criminal background and driver license search, social disease testing including HIV, and a medical evaluation by a fertility specialist.  Surrogate mother does not incur any costs whatsoever throughout the process.  Therefore at any time, if a surrogate mother decides  not to continue in our program, she can walk away without incurring a financial burden.  If a surrogate mother decides to stay with our program, it is because she wants to continue and is dedicated to assisting her couple.
<P>
<DT><B>Do you offer counseling?</B>
<DD>Yes, CSP is associated with four full time independent counselors who have each had over 8 years experience in counseling surrogate mothers and infertile couples.  We provide full counseling before, during and after the birth.  Counseling is available to couples and surrogate mothers for as long as you need the counseling.
<P>CSP offers group support meeting for surrogate mothers.  These meetings are held once a month.  During support group your surrogate will get the opportunity to meet other women who are in various stages of participation in our program.
<P>
<DT><B>How much will surrogacy cost?</B>
<DD>Generally, traditional surrogacy will cost $42,000-$46,000.
Gestational surrogacy costs about $45,000 depending on
the number of retrievals and transfers attempted.
<p>The above figures reflect all anticipated expenses including compensation
to the surrogate, all medical and laboratory fees, psychologist fees, legal
retainers, advertising costs for surrogate mothers, life insurance, medical insurance, etc. The figures above reflect accurate costs from the time you enter our program to the time you are at home with your child, and parental rights are finalized.
<P>
<DT><B>How much will Egg Donation cost?</B>
<DD>To get started in our Egg Donation program, a fee of $500 is paid to the counselor.  ONLY if you select an egg donor and agree to work with her and she agrees to assist you, are additional fees due.
<P>Non-medical costs for egg donation include:
<UL>
<LI><TT>$1,500.00 </TT>Administration & advertising fees - payable to CSP
<LI><TT>$1,000.00 </TT>Psychologist ($500 to begin process, $500 once matching has occurred)
<LI><TT>$2,500.00 </TT>Egg Donor compensation
<LI><TT>$ &#160;750.00 </TT>Attorney fees for Intended Parent's legal counsel, includes contracts
<LI><TT>$ &#160;250.00 </TT>Egg donor attorney fees, includes review of contracts
</UL>
<P>
<DT><B>What if I have my own surrogate?</B>
<DD>CSP recommends a legal and psychological clearance consultation that is offered by independent legal counsel and independent counselors.  For a $500.00 fee, Intended Parents and their potential surrogate mother and her partner, can meet with an attorney and counselor for education and an evaluation. 
<P>CSP does offer to coordinate private arrangements and offers full case management.
<P>
<DT><B>Are you too far away?</B>
<DD>No, on average 20% of our clients live in Australia, Japan, England & Europe.  A large number of our clients live on the East Coast.  Distance to a program should not be as important as the skill level of the people who work for the program, and their yeas of experience.  The  majority of our surrogate mothers live in the State of California.  CSP is located in California because of  the positive political and legal climate California offers.  We are located in Beverly Hills because this location allows us to be ideally geographically located with regards to the infertility doctors, counselors and attorneys.
