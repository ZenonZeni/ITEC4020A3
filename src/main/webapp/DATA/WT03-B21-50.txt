<p>Redwings Horse Sanctuary can benefit directly from your long-distance calls. We believe the money you are already spending on long distance calling can be put to better use than TV commercials for the big three. (Note that LDDS chooses not to waste  millions of dollars on annoying advertisements, they invest their money on ensuring quality and service for their customers.)</p>

<h3>We use LDDS at the office are very pleased!  Won't you please consider helping us and giving LDDS a try?</h3>
