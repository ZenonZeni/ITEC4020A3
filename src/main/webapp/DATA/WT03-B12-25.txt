Letters: Surf's Down


In response to your request for predictions of what will be
hot in '96, I offer the following: The Internet hasn't peaked
yet, but you can almost hear the sound of the firewalls slamming
shut as companies find out that surfing is about as productive
inside a company as it is on the beach.

Big corporations will abandon the Net in droves as they figure
out the economic benefits of creating a non-public, more secure
backbone of their own.

Watch for some big players to figure this out early. Also, CompuServe
and Prodigy will merge. Or will Delphi buy one or both?

Letters: Intelligent Choice


I see interest in topics traditionally associated with artificial
intelligence experiencing a resurgence in 1996 as people try
to get more value out of their data warehouses. The urge to
experiment with data mining will be the primary spark behind
this resurgence.

However, more people will experiment with agents, case-based
reasoning, fuzzy math, genetic algorithms, and neural networks
as they try to better understand what they have stored in their
warehouses.

Rather than one or two products benefiting from this increased
interest, a variety of technologies will see a modest upswing
in sales.

Letters: Development Made Easy



In 1996, I see applicational development in HTML taking off,
removing one of the biggest problems that all businesses have
in developing for hybrid networks.

Products such as Next's Web-Objects will sell tremendously as
corporations realize that age-old problems like remote administration
and remote software distribution are no longer needed on such
a scale, as only servers need to be updated. Also, finished
apps will be viewed by management or any person interested
in the product by simply installing Netscape.

I predict the hot items in 1996 will be cellular voicemail pagers,
cellular video pagers, digital video disks, and Internet home

instead of always having to call services such as SkyTel to
do so.

Editor's Note: Prognostications -- Looking Ahead

By:
Joel Dreyfuss

I'm not sure when journalists were first asked to put down their
notepads and gaze into a crystal ball; maybe they were never
asked at all. I suspect that the ritual of predicting the big
developments of the New Year began when some people in my profession
started taking themselves much too seriously. Somehow, predicting
is in danger of becoming an annual event even in our offices,
where we work hard to keep journalistic egos tightly leashed.

But there's no danger that you'll confuse the editors of InformationWeek
with traveling-sideshow fortune tellers. Our prognostications
are based on solid research and knowledge of the industry.
And we made them for two reasons: The first is that everyone
enjoys reading somebody else's predictions, if only to reinforce
their own feelings of intellectual superiority. But there's
also a second, practical concern: All of us spend so much time
running just to stand still that a look forward can help us
put things in perspective. Our list may even spur you to alter
your technology implementation plans for 1996.

What's Inside

This special issue spotlights the technologies and products
we believe will be making news in 1996. As senior editor Joseph
C. Panettieri points out in his introduction, many of the products
featured will help bring us closer to the idea of the virtual
corporation.

Directory services, advanced network operating systems, groupware,
and Java, among others, all help make geographic location irrelevant
in today's business world. The concept of corporate headquarters
may soon be obsolete. The Internet-that unavoidable, dislocated
entity-may connect us wherever we are, and even whether or
not we want to be connected.

This issue of InformationWeek is unique in several ways. We've
created some nifty interactive links with our Web site (http
//techweb.cmp.com/iwk). Each hot technology listed here will
have a Web resource center to bring together stories we've
done on the subject, and links to related sites. There will
also be some threaded chats and ballots seeking your opinion.
Finally, all the illustrations are by the renowned artist,
Gahan Wilson, His peculiar view of the world seemed just right
for our flight of fancy into the very near future.

Introduction: The New High-Tech Landscape --Tools for building powerful virtual
enterprise networks are now on the horizon

By:
Joseph C. Panettieri

Looking for 1996's hottest information technology trends and
products? The view starts here. Today's technology landscape
is littered with tools for building tomorrow's virtual enterprise
networks. Technologies that were still being tested last year
such as visual development tools and groupware-will be the
basis for crafting the new enterprise structure.

The means are at hand to build communications systems that span
multiple companies, ease information retrieval, and foster
electronic commerce.

For instance, all eyes are on SunSoft's Java scripting language,
which promises a new generation of Internet applications.

After anemic starts, Microsoft's Windows NT and Novell's NetWare
Directory Services should finally provide the needed infrastructure
for distributed network systems. A new version of Lotus Notes
will ratchet up expectations for groupware and could make or
break IBM's $3.5 billion takeover of Lotus Development.

A new generation of client-server development tools will give
technology managers plenty of muscle to build new systems.
Among the products to watch are Borland International's Delphi
and Microsoft's Visual Basic.

Multimedia-ready desktops will provide the delivery vehicle
for applications built using these tools.

Given the hardware demands of such sophisticated client-server
systems, many corporations will turn to robust multiprocessor
servers. Also, the testing cycle will begin on systems using
next-generation 64-bit chips.

There is a plethora of new products on the technology landscape.
The destination is clear: virtual networks that offer anywhere,
anytime information access within and among companies.

The following pages of this special issue suggest how best to
get there.

Online Transactions: Pouring Cash Into The Internet -- In 1995, companies 
learned what they could gain by doing business online. Now they're
ready to make investments

By:
Clinton Wilder

Predicting that electronic commerce will be hot in 1996 is a
bit like predicting that the Super Bowl will be this month's
big media event. To anyone even remotely familiar with the
topic, it's obvious.

If 1995 was the year that the Internet and the World Wide Web
became household words, 1996 is the year that those words will
become gospel to thousands of business and technology managers
around the world. The Web, no longer the sole province of academicians
and Generation X Net surfers, is fast becoming a viable medium
for companies in all industries to post information and take
orders. In addition, 1996 will see technology advances that
will make businesses more comfortable conducting financial
transactions online.

"In terms of absolute growth, business-to-business commerce
online will grow faster this year than business-to-consumer,"
says Torrey Byles, director of electronic commerce for BIS
Strategic Decisions, a market research firm in Santa Clara,
Calif. "As corporate procurement managers get more familiar
with the Net, that will really drive electronic commerce activity.
Because the Net is global, they're beginning to realize the
whole world is their oyster in terms of sourcing."

Several technology areas hold the key to enabling and spurring
the growth of electronic commerce, and all will get significant
attention from vendors in 1996.  That attention will result in
new products and services, new alliances, and, undoubtedly, new
initial public stock offerings.  Among the hot technologies will
be:  Sun's Java scripting language, groupware p.  18), electronic
data interchange (EDI) on the Internet, security, and a new
hardware platform commonly called the Internet PC.

EDI could be the "killer" application that drives more businesses
onto the Internet. That's why Net vendors are seeking to cash
in. Premenos Corp. in Concord, Calif., led the way in 1995
with its Templar software that protects EDI packets on the
Net. And competition looms. Larger EDI players such as IBM,
General Electric Information Services, Sterling Software, and
Harbinger have announced major Internet initiatives or formed
new Internet divisions. "1996 will be a good year for EDI and
the Internet to get married," says Byles of BIS Strategic Decisions.

Of course, electronic commerce won't catch fire unless security
standards are in place. Security experts expect to see more
news reports about obscure flaws discovered in standard encryption
algorithms. There will be continued squabbling between the
Visa-Microsoft and MasterCard-Netscape-IBM alliances over secure
credit-card transaction standards. But experts also expect
to see real advances toward industrial-strength security that
will enable commerce. "Security is still the bugaboo, but a
lot more people now perceive the viability of electronic commerce,"
says David Sims, technical manager of IT at Schlumberger Inc.
in Sugar Land, Texas. "Now that MasterCard and Visa are on
board, you'll see a lot of progress."

Despite the current lack of security and infrastructure to ensure
the safety of large-scale financial transactions on the Internet,
hundreds of companies are moving quickly to make online commerce
a reality. On Jan. 11, AMP Inc. in Harrisburg, Pa., a $4 billion
maker of electronic components, will go live on its Web site
(http://www.connect.amp.com) with an online catalog of 35,000
parts. Using a search engine called Step Search from Saqqara
Systems Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., the site will let customers
search in five languages against AMP's Oracle7 database for
specs, prices, and availability of electric connectors, sockets,
and hundreds of other parts in the AMP catalog. Customers will
be able to order samples or place complete orders, then track
the status of those orders on the Web.

AMP's decision was strictly a business investment. "Our executives
are very conservative here," says Jim Kessler, director of
global electronic commerce at AMP. "A lot of what's out there
on the Web today was motivated by emotion; we weren't going
to do that. We looked at hard dollar savings, and there was
more than enough justification." AMP is banking on its Web
site to put a significant dent in its annual $6 million to
$10 million catalog print production costs, increase the productivity
of its sales force, and reach new markets.

Companies such as AMP, General Electric's plastics division,
and National Semiconductor have elected to host their online
parts catalogs on their own Web sites using third-party technology.
In Nat Semi's case, the technology is Java, making it one of
the first significant business applications written in the
Sun language. Nat Semi, in Santa Clara, Calif., developed a
parametric search engine to let its customers find the chips
they need online.

But other large companies have chosen a different route: using
a Web hosting service to deliver product data to their customers
and distributors. Honeywell, Rockwell International's Allen
Bradley unit, and Square D are among 4,000 companies that have
posted home pages on Industry.Net (http://www.industry.net),
a Pittsburgh service that intends to be a one-stop shop for
buyers seeking manufacturing components.

Tom Jones, Industry.Net's VP of marketing, sees the service
as a way for firms to get started in online commerce. He predicts
big changes in attitudes over the next 12 months. "I don't
think [business has] the confidence at this point that the
Internet is a place to do millions of dollars in secure transactions,"
says Jones. "But that will change. As companies put their public
domain information on the Net, and see the type of traffic
and the types of quality customers they get, they'll get much
more comfortable."

Electronic commerce also represents a huge opportunity for large
corporations to blur the lines between being a user and a vendor
of information technology. That often involves partnerships
with large vendors or systems integrators. The Walgreen drugstore
chain, for example, sells its network technology for automatic
filling of doctors' prescriptions to IBM, which in turn sells
the network capability to other customers. "We have a whole
new breed of partners that are also our customers," says Dennie
Welsh, general manager of global services at IBM.

On the consumer side, use of the Web for information will continue
to expand in 1996 but actual purchases over the Net will grow
more slowly and be more niche-oriented. The best bets for growth
will be information-based products. Heading the list are online
publications and software; the latter already enjoys solid
growth on Web sites such as the Internet Shopping Network and
CyberSource's software.net. "The best consumer products to
sell online are [those] that can be investigated, purchased,
and delivered over the Net," says Mike Homer, Netscape's VP
of marketing.

Another boost to online consumer activity this year will be
thousands of new customers choosing to bank electronically.
Although Microsoft and Intuit called off their blockbuster
merger in 1995, they're being just as aggressive in going after
the electronic banking market separately (IW, Dec. 18, p. 14).
Once customers are comfortable with electronic banking, they'll
be more inclined to pay for products and services electronically."In
1996, we'll see electronic banking laying the groundwork for
a comfort level for electronic payments," says Richard Crone,
senior VP and co-director of electronic banking at Home Savings
of America in Irwindale, Calif. "People will first get the
degree of comfort and familiarity by electronic bill-paying."

But brace yourself: The electronic commerce era is still new.
Twelve months from now, 1995 will seem calm by comparison.

Lotus Notes: Sharing The Workload -- Notes put Lotus Development ahead of
the field in groupware. Will Notes 4 keep Lotus in front?

By:
Stephanie Stahl

When Lotus Notes 4, the 1996 release of the innovative Lotus
Development groupware product, was demonstrated a year ago,
a number of the software's loyal, almost cult-like users stood
up and applauded for more than 10 minutes.

There's no question Notes 4 is hot-and much more than an incremental
upgrade. It includes dramatic improvements in scalability,
ease of use, programmability, Internet access, management,
and more. But Notes 4 also will face much more competition
than its predecessors did.

Lotus-now a unit of IBM-began selling Notes in 1989, and singlehandedly
created a new category of computing called groupware. It took
the market and rival vendors a few years to truly understand
what groupware is all about, allowing Lotus to fly solo.

Now, however, corporate America's desire to collaborate on documents
and share information across networks has other vendors angling
for a piece of the action. Software giants such as Microsoft
and Novell, as well as a slew of small, nimble companies, are
breathing down Lotus' neck with their own groupware products.

While none can claim to do exactly what Notes does-with its
application development, replication, and other sophisticated
features-many products provide some of the collaborative features
users are thirsting for.

The numbers speak for themselves: By 1997, the groupware market
is expected to grow to nearly $4 billion, up from $1.3 billion
in 1994, according to First Albany Corp., a research and investment
banking firm in New York. With increasing competition in the
groupware market and sluggish sales of its other products,
Notes 4 could very well be the most important product ever
for Lotus.

"Release 4 is Lotus' only product," says Giles McNamee, an analyst
with First Albany, which is also a Notes user. "Everything
else is decaying. It's just a question of time before they
finish shoveling the dirt over the other products."

But for Lotus to continue to reign in the groupware market,
it must push Notes deeper into the mainstream. The company
is banking on Notes 4, which will make its official debut at
Lotus' annual user group meeting in January, to help it stay
ahead of the pack.

"It's the most important thing they've got," says Jeff Held,
managing partner for the Center For Technology Enablement at
Ernst & Young in New York, a large Notes user. "Notes 4 could
put them way ahead of any competitor if they have a successful
rollout."

For starters, Notes 4 has a much-improved user interface. It
includes drag-and-drop icons, the ability to open multiple
windows, a multipane screen, and more.

"There is nothing intuitive about using Notes Release 3.x,"
says McNamee. "Everything must be learned. The menus are confusing
and deeply hierarchical. It may be a DOS lover's idea of a
cool application, but for a Mac-trained person, the interface
is nothing short of lame."

Lotus agrees there's ample room for improvement. "We are on
a mission to make Notes applications more accessible to a broad
range of people," says Tim Dempsey, director of Notes product
marketing at Lotus.

More Users, Less Space

As Notes becomes a foundation for critical, enterprise-wide
applications, users will require improvements in scalability
and manageability. With Notes 4, Lotus has come up with ways
to host more users per server, take up less network bandwidth
per user, and have fewer administrators watching the network.

Lotus claims that Notes 4 running on multiprocessor platforms
can support up to 1,000 active, concurrent users per server
compared to approximately 100 to 200 users per server on Notes
3.x platforms.

Notes 4 is based on a 32-bit multithreaded architecture that
exploits symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and increases processor
support to six from two. This SMP support means more simultaneous
sessions per server and increased replication capability.

"With a multiprocessing, high-speed architecture, we will be
able to get many more users on a server," says Held. Ernst
& Young, which has about 100 users per Notes server, has deployed
about 200 servers throughout the enterprise, and is only about
halfway finished. The fewer servers the firm will have to manage
in the future, the better, Held says.

Lotus also has included some new management tools in Notes 4
to allow centralized administration of the Notes network. One
provides a common graphical interface for simultaneously managing
several servers from a single console. Another allows administrators
to centralize policymaking and to delegate specific administration
tasks. A third tool lets administrators make changes to any
server, regardless of its location.

Lotus developers also have made big strides in making Notes
more flexible for travelers. "Some of the [biggest payoffs
in] applications involve mobile users," says Dempsey. "Life
needs to be made easier for them."

To that end, Lotus has made managing location profiles easier
in Notes 4. Users can create multiple location configurations,
such as "home" or "hotel," each with information on dialing
rules, home servers, replication, and more.

After that, all they need to do is pick one of the locations
from a status bar and Notes accommodates that environment.

Users also can determine how they want to replicate information
and decide whether they want to receive all new documents or
E-mail messages or just a certain subset. "This provides users
with a much higher degree of control over how they want to
get information back and forth," says Dempsey.

Replication also has been improved to include field-level capability.
With Notes 4, when a user goes to replicate a document, only
new changes are transmitted. Previously, the entire document
had to be transmitted on the network, taking up valuable bandwidth.
"Even if one letter had changed in a document, the whole thing
would have to be replicated," says Held. "[Field-level replication]
will be a great improvement for a large Notes network."

Notes 4 also has a function called "Server PassThrough" that
enables users to make only one call to access multiple Notes
servers. With earlier releases of Notes, users might have to
make multiple calls just to get all the information they need.
Server PassThrough also allows Notes clients on a LAN to connect
to servers running different network protocols.

Noting The Net

In addition, Notes 4 helps users take advantage of one of the
industry's hottest new developments-the Internet. The software's
server version performs as both a Notes server and a Web server.
It includes native support for key Internet protocols, including
HTML, HTTP, and Java. The groupware also includes the InterNotes
Web Navigator, a feature that enables users to incorporate
Internet-based information into their core Notes applications.
Unlike simple Web browsers, which provide access to the Web,
InterNotes Web Navigator allows users to import Web documents
directly into Notes.

Users can take advantage of all of the inherent capabilities
in Notes for getting information off the Net. For example,
they could use Notes' searching and retrieval capabilities
and agent technology to find and import data from the Web.
An agent-software that performs a rule-based function on the
user's behalf-could be built to automatically retrieve information
from a competitor's Web site and import the data into a Notes
database containing competitive information. Notes could then
distribute the information to the company sales force.

InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML documents,
including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and
URLs into Notes. Once a document is pulled into Notes, the
Web links are still live.

"Today, when you pull information from the Web and put it into
a document, its life as a part of the Web is over," says Dempsey.
"With [InterNotes Web Navigator], all of the links are still
available when you open up a document in Notes." So, from a
Notes document, users can jump to Web sites with the click
of a mouse.

Notes users can also pull FTP, Gopher, Usenet, and other Internet
information that exists beyond the Web into Notes applications.
The Navigator resides on the Notes server, eliminating a need
for TCP/IP

on every client. Administrators can deny access to specific
sites.

While some pundits see the Web's global reach and information
access capabilities as a significant threat to Notes, Lotus
insists there is a market for both.

Products such as InterNotes are examples of how the two can
complement each other, Lotus says. "Notes is tailored for the
business user," says Ray Ozzie, the mastermind behind Notes.
"We don't see a direct threat today. We see nothing but opportunities
from the Internet."

For developers, Notes 4 includes Lotus-Script, a cross-platform,
Basic-compatible, object-oriented programming language. "Notes
is really an elaborate development environment in which users
can build workflow and groupware," says First Albany's McNamee.
"Currently, the scripting is so complicated and arduous that
only well-trained, fully dedicated developers can build applications,
says Held. "LotusScript should greatly expand the number of
people who will write applications for Notes."

It's In The (E-)Mail

As the line between groupware and messaging blurs, Lotus is
improving the E-mail capabilities in Notes. Notes 4 has an
integrated client-server messaging engine with a more intuitive
interface based on cc:Mail, Lotus' hot-selling E-mail system.
This provides dramatic improvement over current mail capabilities,
users say. Adds Lotus' Dempsey: "We want to make it a mindless
experience to do Notes mail." Like previous releases of Notes,
Notes 4 runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including
NT, Unix, and OS/2, as well as on Digital Equipment's Alpha
platform. Lotus enters 1996 with slightly more than 3 million
Notes users-a far cry from the 20 million that Lotus' former
CEO, Jim Manzi, set as a goal for 1997.

But even if the company can't achieve that target-and despite
fears about how well historically bureaucratic IBM will develop
the software-one thing appears certain: Notes 4 will be hot
enough to help Lotus maintain its reputation as the premier
groupware vendor and compete against the toughest competition
it's ever faced. Upgrade: Lotus Notes Navigators (top) allow
users to instantly access graphical Notes data or other apps
by clicking on text or a picture. Developers can use workflow
applications (bottom) to build formula-based options into the
design of Notes forms.

Net gains: Notes' Ozzie sees 'nothing but opportunities from
the Internet.'

Directory Services: Finding The Way -- Directory services will help 
guide technology managers through an enterprise filled with important 
information

By:
Caryn Gillooly

Most information technology managers have a data center full
of technologies that are used almost every day, technologies
they can't imagine living without-E-mail and antivirus software,
for example. In 1996, IT managers are going to add a new technology
to that list: directory services.

Actually, directory services are not so new. Novell included
NetWare Directory Services in its release of NetWare 4.1 operating
system more than a year ago, and Banyan Systems Inc. has offered
its directory service for close to 10 years. Outside the network
operating system market, more than a half-dozen other vendors
have offered directory services for almost as long.

But it's only recently that computer vendors and users have
started to understand directory services.

With Novell still encompassing more than half of the LAN market,
its directory service seems to have gotten more attention than
all other products combined.

"Novell has helped educate the market on the importance of a
directory service," wrote Charles Phillips, an analyst at New
York brokerage Morgan Stanley & Co., in a recent report.

Yet many customers still don't understand what directory services
are and how they can benefit organizations. But 1996 just may
be the time to learn: It's the year Novell's directory service
will become widely deployed, as well as the year in which Microsoft
will come on strong with its own directory service.

Before defining what a directory service is, it's necessary
to define the term directory. A directory is a collection of
information-a repository-that usually is specific to one particular
application. It holds all the information relating to that
application, such as user-login data and user-access rights.
Just about every application on a network has its own directory.
The trick is to make the directories work together, which is
where directory services come in.

With a directory service, all applications can share the same
database of user and network information, and it is unnecessary
to replicate the data throughout the network. "Customers have
a whole gamut of directories, from crude to sophisticated.
Something has to manage those directories," says Jay Seaton,
director of worldwide product marketing for the directory solutions
business unit at Banyan in Westboro, Mass. "The directory service
should be viewed as a common service that makes things easy
to find when you have hundreds of thousands of objects on your
network."

All-In-One

Users agree that getting all that information in one place is
essential. "A comprehensive directory service is what companies
need to get all the data under one structure-that's where the
key is," says John Bullivant, systems manager at J.P. Morgan
& Co., a brokerage in New York.

The larger the network, the more important a single structure
becomes. "Any company that wants to have an enterprise solution
has to get into directory services," says Robert Anderson,
a marketing and communications executive at Control Data Systems,
a systems integrator in Minneapolis. "Directory services are
key to any kind of information tracking."

While many directories exist in the largest companies, few such
companies have implemented any sort of directory service, primarily
because the choice of products is still small and the technology
relatively immature.

The market today is segmented into two types of offerings: LAN
based directory services and enterprise directory services,
says David Cappuccio, VP and research director at Garter Group
Inc., an information technology advisory firm in Stamford,
Conn.

On the enterprise side, there are companies such as Control
Data, Unisys, and ICL Ltd. On the LAN side, the leaders are
Novell with NDS and Banyan with its StreetTalk directory service.
IBM, despite its mainframe heritage, also competes in this
market with its Directory and Security Services for OS/2 LAN
Server and Warp Server. Traditionally, LAN-based directory
services have come bundled with the network operating system
and, consequently, have done little more than provide services
for one particular network operating system.

But things are starting to open up. Banyan set the stage in
early 1993 when it announced its Enterprise Network Service
product line. ENS is a separate package made up of Banyan's
messaging, security, and directory services unbundled from
its Vines network operating system. ENS already is available
on NetWare, several different Unix platforms including IBM's
AIX, and Microsoft's Windows NT.

Banyan took the idea a step further by announcing Universal
StreetTalk. The company will make its directory services code
available to anyone who wants to implement it."This is not
just a set of APIs [application programming interfaces]," says
Seaton. "This is literally giving them the directory."

Novell followed suit in September by saying it will publish
a set of APIs that would let NDS act as the directory not only
for NetWare networks, but also for those based on Microsoft's
Windows NT, IBM's OS/2, and others. "We're going to put NDS
on all other platforms that make sense," says David Clare,
a product manager at Novell.

Even Microsoft has decided to get into the directory services
game. Today, Microsoft doesn't really have a directory service.
There are domain-based services included in NT, but they don't
compare with an industrial-strength directory services such
as NDS. Microsoft says it will ship a true directory service
sometime in 1997 with Cairo, a major upgrade of NT. But it
won't be Microsoft's sole directory; a different one-but upwardly
compatible with Cairo's directory-is expected in Exchange,
the company's messaging and groupware product that is slated
to ship in the first quarter of 1996.

To resolve any potential application conflicts, Microsoft in
September announced the Open Directory Services Interface-its
own directory services API. With ODSI, applications developers
can write to a single API, and their application can access
any directory service that also interfaces with ODSI. That
way, applications can be written independently from any specific
directory service and developers won't have to choose a winner.
Other vendors such as Novell initially agreed to support it,
but they now seem to be backing away from their commitments.

Standards bodies also play a significant role in directory services.
The Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment
(DCE) includes specifications for building an enterprisewide,
distributed directory service, along with specifications for
distributed security, distributed mail services, remote communications,
and more. While Novell says it will make its directory interoperate
with DCE systems, IBM's directory is based on the DCE specifications.

The advantage: DCE can run on all platforms, from the lowest
end PCs to the highest-end mainframes-all of which IBM offer.
"The one thing IS really wants is a name service that deals
with the whole IS structure-scalability to all platforms,"
says Gary Gunnerson, technology chief at USA Today's Information
Network in Arlington, Va.

DCE also can bring its other services-in addition to directory
services-across such a range of platforms. "DCE provides one
secure logon to all systems, including mainframes and Unix
machines," says Lisa Laing, a network systems analyst at McGill
University in Montreal. IBM's DCE directory service is expected
to be available soon.

This cross-platform view is where the enterprise offerings have
the advantage. Companies such as Control Data Systems, ICL,
and Unisys offer directory service products based on X.500,
the International Standards Organisation's framework for developing
an enterprise directory service. Like DCE, X.500 spans platforms.
But X.500 has become more of a gateway solution, a common way
to connect other directory services. "X.500 has the opportunity
and is the only standard out there to be the Esperanto of the
directory world," says Tim Sloane, director of electronic messaging
at the Aberdeen Group Inc., a consulting firm in Boston.

Until recently, the LAN- and enterprise-based directory service
markets were separate. But the two are starting to come together
as LANs become more enterprisewide, and as enterprise-based
products begin to reach down into individual network segments.
Also fueling this convergence is the introduction of directory
service tools specifically designed to bridge that gap.

A Leg Up

The merging of the two markets will get an added boost when
applications begin to stretch from LAN to enterprise networks.
"Directory services has always been behind-the-scenes infrastructure
technology," says Banyan's Seaton. "But as it starts to be
integrated into the applications, the value becomes much more
significant."

Many customers already understand the significance of directory
services. "For our purposes, we needed one place for all the
network information," says Niraj Patel, network and telecommunication
manager at GMAC Mortgage, a NetWare 4 customer in Elkins Park,
Pa. "We went to NetWare 4 because of NDS. It's great to have
a central NDS server to do all of the management."

Until two years ago, W.R. Grace & Co. used Digital Equipment's
PathWorks network operating system. But PathWorks didn't have
a directory service, so the company decided to look for something
else, according to Jonathan Prigot, supervisor of technical
support at the Boca Raton, Fla., chemical company. Grace chose
NetWare 4. "Since we were looking at a corporate network operating
system to bind the company locations into a cohesive whole,
directory services was high on our list," Prigot says.

With the system in place for more than a year, Prigot says he
now appreciates the full benefits of NDS: "It organizes my
resources wonderfully. I get a complete diagram, including
who's on what server and what resources are being used." Grace
still has Hewlett-Packard OpenMail E-mail boxes for employees,
but Prigot says he plans to bring even those mailboxes under
NDS. "We plan to integrate in as much as possible," he says.
"Our ultimate plan is to have one massive directory structure
based on NetWare." But most companies don't have the benefits
of a directory service. For many, installing one is simply
too daunting a task. "It's imposing," says John Miller, a former
data communications specialist at HealthCare Compare Corp.
in Downers Grove, Ill. "[Our] people are comfortable with NetWare

3.11 and 3.12. They're taking classes [on NetWare 4], but that's
about all they're doing."

Some customers see it differently. "For four years we had to
figure out how to manage 100 NetWare servers without a directory,"
says Chuck Rush, global networking manager at fast-food franchiser
McDonald's Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill. "What we have works now.
Since nothing's broken and nobody's screaming, we're going
to wait."

Yet even companies that don't yet have directory services see
the benefit. "It's worth moving to directory services. It's
got a lot to offer," says Miller of HealthCare. "You have to
take a long view. The short view says everything is working
fine. But with a long view, you're no longer managing one server,
you're managing one network."

Even more compelling is the potential for what directory services
can do once the technology and market has matured. "You'll
use directory services to store electronic forms and use it
as an information database for calendaring, scheduling, and
even workflow processes," says Control Data's Anderson. Novell's
Clare agrees: "Directory services is going to be the heart
of the network, from the departmental LAN to global networks."

Windows NT: Bringing In The Best Windows -- Disdained when it first came
out, NT gets second looks

By:
Joseph C. Panettieri

Flash back to the summer of 1993: jurassic Park was smashing
box-office records.

A new First Lady was trying to reinvent the American health
care system. And technology managers were scratching their
heads over Microsoft's 32-bit operating system, Windows NT.

Microsoft chairman and CEO Bill Gates was bullish on his new
product, boldly predicting NT would sell 1 million copies in
its first year.

But the brash Mr. Gates would be proved wrong. Corporations
simply weren't willing to deploy an unproven operating system
that required loads of memory and lacked networking and application
support. Insiders say Windows NT sold less than 400,000 copies
its first year.

Zoom forward to today. While millions of consumers just unwrapped
PCs employing Microsoft's Windows 95, corporate America is
set to ring in the new year with a new look at the 30-month
old NT. "Just about every company we've spoken with has spent
the last two years piloting NT," says Bob Sakakeeny, an analyst
at Boston consulting firm Aberdeen Group Inc. "Those pilots
will turn into deployments this year."

Microsoft won't disclose NT's installed base, but observers
peg it at between 2 million and 4 million units. One by one,
corporations are entrusting their department workstations and
servers to NT, betting that there's life for Microsoft beyond
the traditional desktop PC.

According to more than one market research firm, monthly NT
Server sales have topped 30,000 units since last summer. Those
taking the NT plunge read like a Who's Who of corporate America
 the Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa), Charles Schwab, Chevron,
General Electric, J.C. Penney, Kmart, MCI, and Sprint, among
others.

Experts say NT is enjoying success especially in three key vertical
markets: retail, finance, and energy. For example, "Chevron,
Pennzoil, and Lyondell are moving to NT with a vengeance,"
says Mike Brule, president of Technomation Systems Inc., a
systems integrator in Houston that works closely with oil companies
and helped Amoco Corp. install an NT network. Amoco is using
NT for a custom application that helps company engineers estimate
the cost of potential oil explorations.

Getting Focused

Computer hardware vendors have not lost sight of this trend.
Digital Equipment is training hundreds of engineers to support
Windows NT on systems employing both its Alpha RISC (reduced
instruction set computing) microprocessors and those from Intel
Corp. Says Tim Miller, strategic marketing manager for Alpha
at Digital, "Our long-term operating system strategy is one
that's processor-independent, driven by NT moving down into
the mainstream."

Late last year, NetFrame Systems Inc., a leading maker of servers
running Novell NetWare, hedged its bets and began shipping
fault-tolerant four-way multiprocessor servers preloaded with
NT. Likewise, NEC is preparing multiprocessor NT Servers powered
by Silicon Graphics Inc.'s forthcoming MIPS R10000 chip.

While Microsoft's most recent iteration of Windows, Windows
95, is expected to become the mainstream desktop operating
system, adoption has been slow on the corporate side. Instead,
NT may represent Microsoft's best shot at securing a seat in
enterprise networks. That's because the 32-bit NT supports
symmetric multiprocessing, pre-emptive multitasking, and multiple
hardware architectures, including Intel and several RISC chips
 the PowerPC from Apple, IBM, and Motorola; Silicon Graphics'
MIPS line; and Digital's Alpha series.

Windows NT may have been slow out of the gate, but it always
showed promise. For example, NT's initial release was stable
and contained few "showstopper" bugs capable of crashing an
entire server. That allowed NT to survive until its first upgrade,
version 3.5 (code-named Daytona), shipped in September 1994.
NT 3.5 quickly won praise from corporate testers, who cited
its enhanced connectivity to TCP/IP and NetWare networks, extended
dial-up features, and a growing catalog of application support.
Microsoft followed in mid-1995 with the release of NT 3.51,
the first version of NT to run on the PowerPC.

This year, Microsoft will upgrade NT with the Windows 95 user
interface, an enhanced E-mail inbox known as Exchange Client,
and support for TAPI, a programming interface for building
applications that are integrated with telephone systems.

In 1997, Microsoft hopes to ship the long-delayed NT upgrade
known as Cairo. That upgrade will support an object-oriented
architecture in the form of Network OLE and a new object file
system that will enable information retrieval across distributed
networks. After Cairo, there may be a 64-bit version of NT,
sources say.

Two Systems In One

Windows NT, like Unix and OS/2, can serve two operating system
functions. Its 32-bit engine and graphical interface make it
appropriate as a standalone workstation operating system. Because
it is a stable, multiprocessing, networking system, it also
performs well as a server. In fact, NT has had its best success
so far as a departmental network server. Many companies are
using Windows NT for simple file and print services, as a database
server, or as an applications server.

"NT is clearly gaining momentum," says Larry Shaw, a client
server architect at Seattle retail giant Nordstrom, which has
more than 170 NT Servers. "NT has taken off," says Bob McDowell,
VP of Microsoft's enterprise customer unit. As a result, some
companies are making the switch from older, established operating
systems to NT.

Countrywide Mortgage of Pasadena recently migrated more than
40 servers running Lotus Notes and supporting more than 3,000
users to NT. Those servers had run Notes on top of OS/2. But
Notes scales better on the Microsoft operating system, say
insiders at Countrywide.

NT offers several distinct advantages as a server, including
system and management add-ons Microsoft has developed to work
with it. Pennzoil this year plans to deploy the popular R/3
client-server software from SAP AG on NT and SQL Server, Microsoft's
enterprise database system. "Using NT and SQL Server is a great
way to avoid integration headaches," says Britt Mayo, director
of information technology at Pennzoil in Houston.

Microsoft has found success marketing NT and SQL Server together
because SQL Server leverages the familiar Windows interface
and uses setup routines that are similar to Microsoft's desktop
applications. In fact, International Data Corp., a market research
firm in Framingham, Mass., says annual sales of NT database
servers surpassed those of IBM OS/2 database servers in 1995,
and predicts that NT will surpass NetWare in that category
this year, making NT the No. 2 database server behind Unix.
"Microsoft has successfully targeted the database server market
with NT," declares Dan Kusnetzky, research manager for Unix
and advanced operating environments at IDC.

Just ask Nordstrom, which uses NT and SQL Server to route clothing
to its nationwide stores. Also, Alliant Food Service, formerly
a division of Kraft Foods, is using Microsoft's Systems Management
Server along with NT and SQL Server to distribute software
electronically across its network.

Reaching Out

NT's appeal has begun to extend beyond database servers. A handful
of enterprise applications is finally available for the operating
system, including Computer Associates' Unicenter management
platform, Lotus' Notes groupware, IBM's CICS transaction processor,
and Microsoft's own BackOffice, a suite of server applications
for NT that includes database, messaging, mainframe gateway,
and systems management software.

This year may see NT proliferate on the desktop as a powerful
alternative to Unix as a workstation operating system. More
than 40 companies, including MCI and Hewlett-Packard, each
plan to deploy NT Workstation on more than 10,000 PCs. That
proliferation will be helped by an outpouring of 32-bit productivity
applications for Windows 95, including programs from Microsoft,
Starfish Software, and Lotus, many of which have been certified
to run on NT. "NT is gaining more and more applications support,"
says Kusnetzky.

FirePower Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., is among the first vendors
to sell NT-based PowerPCs, and more hardware support-from RISC
and Intel system vendors-is on the way. Compaq Computer, Dell,
and others this year are expected to introduce NT systems powered
by Intel's latest chip, the Pentium Pro.

NT is expected to be more widely used than Windows 95 on the
Pentium Pro, because the chip is optimized for operating systems
that are fully 32-bit. Windows 95 contains some 16-bit code
to ensure compatibility with Windows 3.x applications.

In addition to new NT hardware platforms, significant software
for NT from Microsoft also will hit the market this year. First
up is Gibraltar, Microsoft's just-released Internet server
software for NT. Gibraltar is causing a stir among NT users,
and aims to challenge Unix's popularity as a doorway to the
Internet. "I can't wait to get my hands on Gibraltar for testing,"
says NT user Matt Merrick, VP of information systems at Merrick
Printing Co. of Louisville, Ky.

Incoming Upgrade

Also coming is the long-delayed Exchange Server, Microsoft's
NT-based messaging and groupware upgrade to MS Mail Server.
Exchange Server isn't expected to match the groupware capabilities
of Lotus Notes, but it does promise to relieve the scalability
headaches companies encounter with MS Mail.

Analysts say NT's momentum should carry throughout the year,
but the competition is not sitting still.

Novell shipped the first SMP version of NetWare 4.1 in December,
and IBM this quarter is expected to release OS/2 Warp Server,
which will combine its LAN Server network operating system
with the easy-to-use Warp operating system. "Warp Server technology
is strong, and its systems management features are powerful,"
says IDC's Kusnetzky. "But its superior technology could be
considered a moot point; OS/2 is lagging in corporate mindshare
because of Microsoft's marketing expertise with NT."

One place Microsoft clearly trails IBM is in the area of enterprise
services and support. In an effort to compensate, Microsoft
late last year opened NT support centers in Europe and in Asia,
allowing the software giant to offer global 24-hour support
for multinational companies. Microsoft has more than 1,000
employees trained on NT, and has recruited AT&T Global Information
Solutions, Digital Equipment, and Hewlett-Packard to help support
NT globally. These developments indicate NT is poised to establish
itself on corporate America's department workstations and servers.

Multiprocessor Systems: PC Multiplier -- Windows NT teams with fast PC 
servers to bring symmetric multiprocessing into the corporate mainstream

By:
Brian Gillooly

How can symmetric multiprocessing, a technology that's been
around for years, be hot for 1996? Because, thanks to the proliferation
of Microsoft's Windows NT and the raw power of Intel's Pentium
Pro processor, low-cost, high-performance, reliable PC-based
multiprocessing servers will finally become a familiar component
of the corporate enterprise.

For years, technology managers shunned SMP servers because of
unreliable operating systems, high cost, and unproven promises
in performance. But according to vendors and industry market
research firms, 1996 will see an explosion of SMP server sales,
outpacing even the huge expansion of the overall server market.

Customers like USAir Group Inc.'s operations research division
seek to leverage the price-performance advantages of x86-based
SMP servers. Lloyd Blauen, Unix LAN administrator for USAir
in Arlington, Va., says the company has begun installing several
SMP-based IBM PC servers and plans to add more across the operations
research division once the SMP version of IBM's OS/2 Warp is
available early in January. "Warp SMP is pretty robust," says
Blauen, "and there are applications we're writing that definitely
require SMP power."

Like USAir, many companies kicked the SMP tires in 1995. James
McDonnell, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's Network
Server division, says it's significant that customers now seem
to be less skittish about SMP technology moving into the new
year. "1995 was the year for pouring the foundation, and in
1996, the studs go up," McDonnell says.

Ready To Roll

PC makers say the crucial testing stage for SMP servers is nearly
complete, and pent-up demand is about to be satisfied. "A lot
of large corporate customers have deployed servers in a pilot
environment and are now ready to blast it across the enterprise,"
says John Thompson, director of systems platform marketing
for Compaq's systems division.

That paints a bright future for this technology. Dave Ellenberger,
VP of corporate marketing for Data General Corp. in Westboro,
Mass., anticipates at least 30% growth in the low-end SMP server
market this year.

Gene Austin, VP of marketing for Compaq's systems division in
Houston, is even more bullish. He believes the overall x86
based server market will grow about 50% this year, while the
SMP segment will balloon 60% to 75%

"The Pentium Pro will drive a lot of it because you get multiprocessing
systems in the $15,000-to-$20,000 range in powerful boxes,"
says Austin. "It's cheap horsepower."

Price point aside, Austin says information technology managers
are more willing to install SMP servers because the operating
systems are "a lot stronger."

Compaq should know. Out of 600 sites that have installed SAP's
R/3 client-server financial system on Windows NT-based SMP
servers, about half are using the Houston manufacturer's hardware.

David House, general manager of Intel's enterprise computing
group in Santa Clara, Calif., agrees that today's more robust
operating systems will help speed adoption of SMP. "The operating
system, where the rubber meets the road, is much better at
handling

SMP today," he notes.

Compaq says users are responding in kind. "We're not having
to do too much convincing on NT being robust enough," says
Compaq's Thompson.

Customers are finding that the performance, security, and reliability
of the 32-bit software are adequate for running many enterprise
level applications, Thompson says. "Any SAP site is a bet-your
business site," he adds.

There will be 2.4 million SMP servers-both x86 and RISC (reduced
instruction set computing)-shipped worldwide this year, according
to International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham,
Mass.

But it is the low-cost, high-volume equation that Intel is pushing
with its Pentium Pro chip and motherboard strategy that will
expand the x86 SMP server market.

The high-end SMP server industry is "largely still proprietary
and still fragmented," says Steve Smith, an analyst with brokerage
PaineWebber in New York. But Intel's approach will change that.
"If you take the volume side of the equation and leverage that
for the entire industry, that's what is different now," he
says.

Also, for the first time, servers are being optimized for multiprocessing.
"The hardware and software are being designed to do a specific
function, and when you add Lotus Notes or some other workgroup
application, you get a machine designed top-to-bottom as a
whole solution," says Michael Coleman, general manager for
the IBM PC Co.'s server business. "That's what people are getting
excited about."

Fred DeBoer, network services director for Advanced Technology
Labs, a Bothell, Wash., manufacturer of diagnostic ultrasound
equipment, says his company plans to roll out an SMP version
of Novell's GroupWise messaging system, known as GroupWise
XTD, on low-cost NetFrame 8540 servers by the mid 1996.

"Businesses are realizing that SMP isn't technology we should
be into, but rather technology we better be into," says DeBoer.

NT's Role

Corporate customers also are becoming more comfortable with
running enterprise-level applications on PC-based SMP servers
as they see more successful deployments by their peers.

"Four years ago, less than 10% of x86-based servers were running
Oracle. Now it's more than 40%," says Larry Ellison, CEO of
Oracle in Redwood Shores, Calif.

The advancement of Windows NT is crucial for the expansion of
the low-cost x86-based SMP server market-and vendors say corporate
America is responding. Kevin Roberts, product manager for high
performance PC workstations at Advanced Logic Research Inc.
in Irvine, Calif., says about 15% of all machines Advanced
Logic ships are loaded with Windows NT. That figure is expected
to grow to 40% by mid-1996 and to nearly 50% near year's end.

Financial firms, comforted by the security features they find
in Windows NT, are among the early adopters of the operating
system.

Combined with what HP's McDonnell calls "the midyear kicker"
of the Windows 95 interface being built into Windows NT, SMP
servers will become more popular in general business-productivity
environments. "That helps because it adds more [support] to
the message," McDonnell says.

Compaq's Thompson says the company ended 1994 with several Windows
NT Server installations in the 50-unit range. Now, he says,
Compaq is logging orders for 1,000 or more NT Servers, about
70% of which are two-way or four-way SMP servers.

One of the clear advantages Windows NT has over Unix in an SMP
server environment is its lack of complexity. "Unix could use
a friendlier interface," says ALR's Roberts. "Unity among all
the different flavors of Unix would be a nice start."

The Pentium Factor

But just as the acceptance of new, robust software will help
expand the SMP server market, hardware factors in heavily.

HP's McDonnell refers to Intel's Pentium Pro processor as "a
pivotal product," not only because it is a high-performance
chip at a relatively low cost, but because it will help drive
x86-based SMP servers higher into the enterprise. So the foundation
for moving upscale has been set. Pentium servers such as HP's
NetServer LS and Compaq's ProLiant 4500 are solid platforms
from which corporate America can now migrate upward to two
way and four-way servers.

Data General, which for years has focused on SMP servers on
the Motorola 88000 platform, made a wholesale conversion to
Intel's Pentium and Pentium Pro to capitalize on high-volume
sales opportunities in the future. "We expect the low end of
server computing to be defined by the Intel architecture,"
says VP Ellenberger. He adds that while the Unix-versus-Windows
NT debate continues, Data General will offer its DG-UX operating
system as well as NT.

"One of the desirables in the SMP space has always been lots
of shrink-wrapped applications," says Ellenberger. "Unix has
never lived up to this, and probably never will. But as [a
shift to Intel's high-volume SMP motherboard] concept occurs,
software vendors see more volume for a port."

PC makers for years have fought the characterization of PC-based
servers as weak and unmanageable. Most have been used as no
more than file-and-print servers, where the need for multiprocessing
is minimal.

But beginning early in 1995, vendors began paying more attention
to the management side of server technology, and software like
IBM's NetFinity, Compaq's Insight Manager, and HP's NetManager
became the competitive selling point for the servers.

"This brought about a change in the use of PC servers," says
IBM PC Co.'s Coleman. IBM plans to create an end-to-end enterprise
security blanket for its server line in 1996 by integrating
NetFinity server-management software with NetView systems-management
technology. "Right now, it's not seamless, tightly integrated,
or fully functional," adds Coleman. "We'll integrate several
products in stage one into a workgroup product."

Coleman says products like IBM's SystemView, which provide fully
integrated system management, enable customers to eliminate
some of the middle layers of management software to save money
and give the system administrator greater control over the
entire corporate enterprise.

With this higher level of management and availability, customers
now have more confidence in the ability of SMP servers to handle
vital business applications. Frank DeVito, information systems
manager for Rogers and Wells, a large New York law firm, says
that with real estate at a premium and a small network administration
staff, it's now crucial to be able to consolidate servers into
larger SMP models and have iron-clad server-management tools.

"We can run more NLMs [NetWare Loadable Modules] on the same
box without it taking a toll on the horsepower of the CPU,"
says DeVito.

Rogers and Wells already has deployed several Compaq ProLiant
4500 servers in an SMP configuration running Windows NT SQL
Server, and it plans to take the rest of its half-dozen or
so ProLiants to SMP when NetWare is boosted to that level.

"We're looking forward to more multiprocessing database applications
in NetWare once we're able to scale beyond a single processor,"
says DeVito.

With the robustness and reliability of Windows NT and the cheap
horsepower supplied by the Pentium Pro, IT managers are finding
single-processor systems fast becoming an arcane and expensive
way to approach client-server computing in the corporate enterprise.
In simple terms, that means 1996 is shaping up to be a blockbuster
year for low-cost SMP servers.

High-Speed Processors: Plugging In 64-Bit Chips -- Systems based on superfast 
processors are on the horizon

By:
John Foley

If you consider yourself leading edge because you just upgraded
to 32-bit software and left the 16-bit world behind, think
again. An entirely new generation of systems, based on superfast
64-bit microprocessors, is about to hit the streets.

Power users can expect to see big advances in microprocessor
performance in 1996. Two giants in the world of RISC (reduced
instruction set computing) processors, Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Hewlett-Packard, introduced their first 64-bit chips late
in 1995-and systems based on those chips will be rolled out
this year. IBM and Motorola plan a midyear release of the PowerPC
620, a 64-bit version of their jointly developed microprocessor
line.

Two veterans of 64-bit computing, Digital Equipment and Silicon
Graphics' Mips Technologies subsidiary, also plan upgrades
that will significantly boost their already powerful devices.

"Users are very hungry for them," says John Logan, a VP with
the Aberdeen Group, a research and consulting firm in Boston.
"We can already see the advantages with Digital's Alpha." The
new chips aren't for the timid. They offer raw speed, huge
memory cache, and support for very large file systems-and cost
up to 50% more than 32-bit chips. Initially, Sun and HP will
offer their chips-the UltraSparc I and the PA-8000, respectively
only in their top-of-the-line workstations and servers.

By the year 2000, however, 64-bit chips will become the norm.
"The move to 64-bit processing is as inevitable as night following
day," says Mike Lambert, VP of technical strategy with X/Open,
the independent standards organization in Menlo Park, Calif.
Is 64-bit-ness worth the migration headaches-applications need
to be rewritten or recompiled to reap maximum benefit-and the
extra cost? If sales of Digital's 64-bit Alpha chip are any
indication, a growing number of users think so: Digital's Alpha
business grew by 77% in fiscal 1995, which ended in July.

Experts say two factors-graphics-intensive computing and the
need for heavy-duty databases-are driving 64-bit technology.
Typical examples: Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham in
Philadelphia is tapping Alpha systems to store and analyze
data in an application that involves simulating molecules.
Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, Conn., has deployed a cluster
of Alphas for jet-engine design.

The Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel chose two Alpha-based servers
to replace two Unisys V-380 "light" mainframes. Peter Stockhausen,
the newspaper's VP of information technologies, says his company
also looked at IBM's AS/400 minicomputer and an HP midrange
system. "The HP and IBM were fairly comparable to each other,"
he says. "Digital was significantly faster in total throughput."
The Journal/Sentinel now runs its customer-service database
and billing system on the Alpha servers. Bottom-line benefits
include faster access to customer records and better customer
service.

A major advantage these new chips offer is that 64-bit computing
breaks through the 4-Gbyte memory limit of 32-bit systems.
Digital's Alpha Server 8000, for instance, supports 14 Gbytes
of memory. The larger cache makes it possible to process huge
chunks of data on a single chip.

"With 64 bits, you can have one big application running in memory,"
says Patrick Smyth, director of marketing with Digital's Unix
business segment in Maynard, Mass. "That translates into dramatically
improved performance and much shorter response times," he adds.

Record-Breaking Benchmark

The proof behind these performance claims? In December, Oracle
announced a record-breaking benchmark of 11,456 tpmC (transactions
per minute based on the C set of benchmark tests created by
the Transaction Processing Performance Council in San Jose,
Calif.) for its Oracle7 database. The benchmark was set using
an eight-processor Alpha server running Digital's 64-bit Unix
operating system.

Another technical barrier that's smashed by a 64-bit architecture
is file size. A 64-bit file system can handle much larger files
than a 32-bit system-a decided advantage as images and video
become part of a file system.

But sheer speed is the most talked-about advantage of a 64-bit
world. Chipmakers are already one-upping each other with claims
of world-leading performance. On Nov. 2, HP announced release
of the PA-8000, billed as having "the highest performance available
today," 8.6 SPECint95 (a measure of CPU Integer performance
by Standard Performance Evaluation Corp. in Manassas, Va.).
Less than two weeks later, Digital announced sampling of its
Alpha 21164, touted as "the world's fastest and highest performance
microprocessor," at 11 SPECint95.

Living In The Real World

Experts warn users not to get caught up in the benchmark brouhaha.
"We discount the meaningfulness of a spec number [because]
it doesn't reflect what a real-world application with real
world data is like," says Steve Schick, a spokesman for Mips
Technologies in Mountain View, Calif. Mips' redesigned 64-bit
chip, the R10000, will go into production in January.

"The better measure is when you get down to real applications,"
agrees Arthur Goldberg, executive VP with HAL Computer Systems,
a Campbell, Calif., subsidiary of Fujitsu. HAL just began shipping
workstations based on its own Sparc-compatible 64-bit chip,
the Sparc64.

In other words, technology managers should try before they buy.
But regardless of the processor, it's fair to expect a major
performance improvement when pumping an existing application
through a 64-bit machine. A typical example: HP says 32-bit
applications will run 70% to 100% faster on its PA-8000.

There are important differences in 64-bit platforms. Silicon
Graphics Inc., for instance, is the market leader in "floating
point" performance, important for 3-D and graphical applications
such as animation. Silicon Graphics' customers include Disney
and Ford Motor Co. With the R10000, says Schick, Silicon Graphics
is concentrating on "reducing bottlenecks that hang up a processor,"
rather than devoting all of its attention to the sheer speed
of the chip. The goal is improved database performance. "We've
been running database trace code, and so far it is proved out
that there's a huge difference in performance," says Schick.

Silicon Graphics attributes the R10000's performance improvements
to two techniques: dynamic scheduling and nonblocking caches.
The former improves processor efficiency by "reordering" instructions
to suit the execution resources of the chip. The latter keeps
the processor active rather than waiting for data it may later
need to complete an operation.

Sun is challenging Silicon Graphics with the UltraSparc I, which
it bills as "the world's first general purpose microprocessor
to deliver on-chip support for MPEG-2 decode." MPEG-2 is an
industry standard for broadcast-quality video.

Digital and HAL Systems, on the other hand, concede the high
end graphics niche to Silicon Graphics. "We don't pretend to
think we can compete with them in the entertainment business
at the high end," says Bill Glazier, Digital's director of
workstation marketing in Maynard, Mass.

Digital has its own bragging rights. It is one of the few 64
bit chip suppliers with a 64-bit operating system, Digital
Unix. Sun's Solaris and HP's HP-UX are 32-bit operating systems
that have been tuned for 64-bit chips but are unable to take
full advantage of the 64-bit architecture. In addition, Digital
sells Microsoft's 32-bit Windows NT operating system for the
Alpha.

Rich Sevcik, VP and general manager of HP's systems technology
group in Cupertino, Calif., acknowledges that 32-bit software
cannot take full advantage of 64-bit hardware. "You can increase
the clock rate [of the application], but that has nothing to
do with 64-bit-ness," he says.

No Need To Rush

HP has promised to deliver a 64-bit version of HP-UX in the
second half of 1996. Once done, applications still need to
be written or recompiled to run in 64-bit mode. "There are
very few 64-bit apps in the world," says Sevcik. "In commercial
environments, we're not going to see 64-bit applications for
three to five years."

Indeed, for most organizations, there's no need to rush into
64-bit computing, says Sevcik. Fewer than 5% of current HP
systems ship with the maximum 4 Gbytes of memory, evidence
of untapped potential on 32-bit systems. The extra power of
64-bit processors, he says, is mainly needed for high-end database
applications. "If you're doing something like decision support,
it's worth paying for the large memory," says Sevcik. "You'll
get some benefit from that."

Graphics-intensive computing is the other big strength of 64
bit chips, making them a good match for the real-time multimedia
applications soon to appear on the World Wide Web. However,
PowerPC partners IBM and Motorola, and PC chip giant Intel
agree with HP's analysis-that 32-bit chips will continue to
meet the needs of most users. In fact, the 32-bit PowerPC 604
is nearly as powerful as the 64-bit PowerPC 620.

This is a dilemma that has caused IBM and Motorola to delay
the 620's release until mid-1996. They hope to widen the performance
gap between the two processors over the next six months.

Intel and HP are partnering on a 64-bit architecture that combines
the two dominant chip technologies: RISC and CISC (complex
instruction set computing). The partners have yet to announce
a microprocessor based on the HP-Intel Architecture, but experts
expect a 64-bit chip, called the P7, in 1997 or later. Until
then, Intel will be pushing Pentium Pro, a 32-bit processor
released in November.

Long-term planners have their sights set on the new generation
of 64-bit chips and beyond. "Today's move toward 64-bit file
systems and 64-bit processing are just stages in the evolution
of information technology," says X/Open's Lambert. "It is important
to recognize this and not develop solutions for 64-bit that
are not sufficient for 128-bit and beyond."

Voice Messaging: A Smart Service -- Wildfire has unveiled an electronic 
assistant that can answer, forward, and identify calls-while still sounding
human

By:
Mary E. Thyfault

The hottest, hippest new must-have for the upwardly mobile professional
is the Wildfire Electronic Assistant. If you don't have one
or at least know somebody who does-that's likely to change
this year. If your job depends on your phone, Wildfire can
change your life.

The system, offered by Wildfire Communications Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., runs on a server that handles all incoming and outgoing
voice communications, no matter where you are. Users dial a
number to access their own pre-programmed Wildfire Assistant.
Then, a computerized female voice-which doesn't sound computerized
at all-uses voice recognition technology to prompt users through
the management of their incoming and outgoing voice communications.

Beyond handling voicemail, the system, at the user's voice request,
can quickly return calls to people who left a message. During
a Wildfire session, the system will even interrupt itself to
announce and connect the user to incoming calls.

Wildfire can forward calls to any phone and tell hotel operators,
"I'm looking for John Doe." Like any good assistant, it lets
users screen calls on the fly or by using a preprogrammed list.
If you don't answer a call, Wildfire can tell you who is calling
by sending a message via a pager.

The real power of Wildfire will be evident as virtual workgroups
grow more common. For example, Wildfire can let a developer,
contractor, and real estate agent communicate as if they were
using the same office voicemail system and personal assistant.
If the real estate agent and contractor called their Wildfire
Assistants at the same time, they could connect and talk to
each other from two distant pay phones.

Wildfire also can call users in a restaurant during a long lunch,
reminding them that it's time to move on to the next appointment.
"It's the beginning of the growth of machines talking to people
on behalf of people," says Paul Saffo, a Wildfire user and
director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.

It's also addictive. Says Rick Smolan of Sausalito, Calif.,
"If I had to choose between my car and Wildfire, I would probably
give up my car." Smolan is president of Against All Odds Productions,
which just produced the book, The Passage To Vietnam. While
assembling the book, his Wildfire Assistant called him every
day in Vietnam with messages, then dialed all his outgoing
calls, saving expensive hotel phone charges. "It's like having
a little person following you around," Smolan says. "At a pay
phone, I can get things done in minutes that used to take an
hour."

That's because Wildfire helps eliminate voicemail tag. Currently,
about 75% of all calls fail to connect with the intended recipient,
and most end up in voicemail, the company says. At the same
time, Wildfire enables time-pressured professionals to politely
screen out all non-urgent phone calls.

It also helps juggle demanding clients and dual professional
lives. Take Chris Gregory: By day, he's director of sales and
client services for Video-It in Culver City, Calif., the country's
oldest post-production house. By night, he does commercial
voiceovers for products such as the Ginsu knife, Nordic Track
exercise machines, and Packard Bell computers. Missing a call
can cost Gregory $300 to $1,000. "If I don't get back to someone
in five to 10 minutes," he says, "they're dialing someone else."

A few months ago, Wildfire began licensing companies to offer
the Wildfire Electronic Assistant as a dial-in service, eliminating
the need to buy a $50,000 server. Wildfire has licensed the
service to three bureaus that offer the service for as little
as $39 a month, though heavy users are more likely to spend
$150 to $250 a month.

Licensees include Advanced Communications Inc. in Effingham,
Ill., which targets Wildfire to sales and marketing entrepreneurs;
Milcom Corp. in Wilmington, Mass., which is marketing to New
England and Northeast professionals; and Virtuosity, which
already counts N.Y.P.D. Blue co-executive producer and director
Mike Robins as a user, is targeting the capital of hip: Los
Angeles.

Purchasing a service instead of a $50,000 server is catching
on like ... well, let's just say that Wildfire co-founder Nick
d'Arbeloff believes "it's possible that the service business
could overwhelm the server business fairly quickly." One reason
may be that those people who can't drop $50,000 for a server
"may well be more in need of Wildfire than their corporate
counterparts" who have support staff, he says.

Quick Response

Wildfire seems to work well for CambridgeCAD Technologies Inc.,
a four-person Apple and IBM reseller that is on call constantly
to provide customer support. "It's critical that we respond
to our customers quickly, and this is much better than pagers
or portable phones," says Dan Tully, executive VP of the Cambridge,
Mass., company.

"It frees us so that we don't have to have somebody in the office
constantly." At about $8 a day, it's also cheaper than a receptionist.
But Tully says the potential loss of revenue from missed calls
far outweighs the subscription cost. "There's really nothing
to compare it to," he says.

Wildfire already has generated a lot of interest. In the past
year, more than 60,000 callers have heard a demonstration of
the service by calling the company's "800-Wildfire" demo line.
The company expects to have service bureaus in the 10 largest
metropolitan areas by the second quarter of 1996, with national
coverage and several thousand users by year's end. Cellular
providers AT&T and Pacific Bell will integrate the technology
into their service in 1997, and Wildfire is in discussions
with other carriers.

What's next? How about networking Wildfire servers together
and letting multiple Wildfire Assistants schedule and set up
conference calls? In the future, Wildfire will handle all communications,
including E-mail and faxes. Someday, you may even be able to
program your assistant by dialing in through the World Wide
Web.

Further down the line, Wildfire may provide assistance at home
monitoring the baby's room, turning off the oven, or telling
the temperature outside. Or you may use Wildfire in your car.
But Wildfire isn't for everything- when it comes to voice recognition
for television remote controls, d'Arbeloff believes the thumb
is faster. But in other cases, once someone's gotten used to
Wildfire, it's hard to let go. Says Saffo, "It already seems
like a foreign idea for me to take a phone call without first
knowing who's on the other end."

Paging Systems: New Wireless -- As paging technologies evolve, companies gain
low-cost ways to deliver information to mobile workers

By:
Jill Gambon

Skytel Corp. was ahead of its rivals when it rolled out the
first two-way paging service last September. But the company
can expect plenty of competition this year as several companies
introduce their own two-way paging and voice messaging services
on the much-hyped narrowband Personal Communications Services
(PCS) networks, thus bringing anytime, anywhere communication
a step closer to reality.

As those PCS networks come on line, paging products, long derided
as low-tech gadgets, are starting to gain respect and win over
corporate users. PCS networks operate at higher radio frequencies
than cellular and use twice as much radio spectrum as one-way
paging. They offer two-way messaging, voice, and even full
data transfer services. As the technology evolves, companies
envision pagers becoming a low-cost alternative for delivering
key business information to mobile workers.

The information systems department at Global Marine Inc., an
offshore drilling contractor in Houston, has been using SkyTel
2-Way for several months to keep LAN technicians in contact
with the help desk. SkyTel's service lets technicians answer
messages with preprogrammed replies like "stuck in traffic"
or "I'll call in 15 minutes." They can also send an up-to-500
character E-mail message by connecting the device to a Hewlett
Packard palmtop computer.

Constant Contact

Global Marine technicians, who roam among three buildings, no
longer have to find a phone to answer a page. "What I like
is the response capability," says Gary Garrison, the company's
telecommunications manager. "If you're in a meeting, you can
deal with a problem without having to get up and use the phone."

It is precisely this ability to stay in constant contact and
easily exchange information that SkyTel and its rivals hope
will drive demand for their services. SkyTel and others have
invested heavily in building PCS networks. SkyTel got a head
start when it won a Pioneer Preference award from the FCC in
1991 to develop the first two-way messaging service. Since
then, 10 companies-including SkyTel-have paid more than $617
million for the nationwide narrowband PCS licenses the FCC
auctioned in July 1994.

The rollout of two-way paging and voice messaging comes at a
time when paging's popularity is at an all-time high. Some
34 million Americans carry pagers, up from 27.3 million last
year, according to Dorothy Salmon, a paging analyst with MTA
EMCI, a telecommunications consulting firm in Washington. Salmon
expects demand to grow by 25% to 30% a year during the next
few years.

Some companies already use one-way paging networks to deliver
limited amounts of information. The New England Medical Center
in Boston uses software from Data Critical Corp. of Redmond,
Wash., to transmit EKG files to doctors over one-way paging
networks.

The advent of two-way messaging should increase the capacity
for sending and requesting information, permitting bigger,
more complex files to be exchanged, says Craig Kairis, VP of
business development for Data Critical. "There's more bandwidth,
so we will be able to do more faster," he says. Particularly
promising is the potential for PCS networks to access and query
the corporate database, Kairis adds.

Trials In The Offing

With the network infrastructure nearly built, many carriers
are getting ready to roll out trials. Sometime in the first
quarter, Paging Network Inc. (PageNet) in Plano, Texas, will
begin testing its voice-messaging service in San Francisco,
Dallas, and New York over its PCS network. Dubbed VoiceNow,
the service promises to transform a pager into a pocket-sized
answering machine for about $20 a month. PageNet subscribers
will listen to digital voice messages by holding a pager to
their ear. By mid-year, PageNet plans to launch trials of a
two-way data messaging service in Atlanta. Like SkyTel, PageNet's
service will let subscribers send pre-programmed messages or
reply to a page by selecting from a menu of responses. By 1997,
the company expects to offer more robust data transfer, like
sending spreadsheets over its PCS network.

PageMart in Dallas also plans to launch trials of its voice
messaging and two-way paging service this year. The company
expects subscribers will eventually use the data service to
conduct transactions such as airline and hotel reservations
or to order theater tickets. PageMart is aggressively courting
software makers to integrate wireless messaging with enterprise
applications such as E-mail.

"The [PCS] spectrum is considered a wide-open frontier. The
software will give it its personality," a PageMart spokeswoman
says. To prime the pump, the company released a software developer's
kit last June. PageMart is working with the software companies
to target vertical markets like field service and field sales.

AirTouch Communications of Dallas also is developing a two-way
messaging service that is expected to debut this year. Another
supplier, PCS Development Corp. of Greenville, S.C., is expected
to begin trials of a voice messaging service over its two-way
network in Atlanta in the first quarter and in Boston in the
second quarter. The company expects to have nationwide voice
messaging and two-way data messaging by 1997.

The investment community is also getting involved. In November,
PCS Development announced it raised $55.5 million in a private
equity offering, the largest venture-backed private equity
financing in 1995, according to Securities Data Corp., a Newark,
N.J. research firm.

For its part, SkyTel is improving its pager's design and better
integrating its network with enterprise applications such as
database querying. The company is readying beta versions of
its software developers kit and is upgrading the pager with
pen input capabilities to make it easier to generate messages,
says Doug Brackbill, SkyTel's senior VP of advanced applications.

Some envision the day when pagers equipped with infrared ports
will enable wireless file transfer between pager and PC. Updated
spreadsheets or word processing documents sent to a pager could
be transferred via infrared to a laptop or PC for viewing or
printing. Notebook makers are expected to build two-way paging
capabilities into their machines, eliminating the need to connect
the pager to the notebook to transfer files. "It's so obvious
that two-way paging should be built into notebooks," says Ira
Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research in Wilmette, Ill. "A
lot of the voicemail phone tag and hunting for phones would
be avoided."

Motorola, developer of the Reflex two-way paging protocol, has
licensed its technology to Texas Instrument's semiconductor
division, so notebooks with two-way paging capabilities could
be on the market by year's end, says Larry Conlee, corporate
VP and director of worldwide markets for Motorola's advanced
messaging systems division. Brodsky also expects paging capabilities
will soon be better integrated into personal digital assistants,
creating a market for information services like traffic updates
and travel and entertainment reports to be delivered over PCS
networks.

One looming issue, however, is dueling standards. While many
paging companies are basing their systems on Reflex, AT&T has
developed a TCP/IP standard, known as Pact (Personal Air Communications
Technology). "The fact that AT&T would invest energy and time
to come up with their own standards underscores how important
this market is," says Motorola's Conlee.

Interactive System: Media Circus -- More apps, low prices draw business to 
multimedia tent 

By:
Mary Hayes

For consumers, the definition of multi-media is easy: cool PC
games, CD-ROM videos, and CD-quality music played on a PC or
Macintosh. But business and technology managers are still struggling
to define multimedia and what multimedia technologies mean
to their enterprises. To many technology managers, "multimedia"
is a code word for flashy, yet unnecessary, devices and applications
that are too pricey to be truly useful.

Business attitudes about multimedia should begin to change in
1996. Advances in technology and lower costs will help business
PCs evolve from tools that create and manipulate static, text
based information to integrated communications systems that
incorporate sound and movement while encouraging user interaction.
More businesses will begin to use desktop videoconferencing,
computer-based training, interactive catalogs, and other multimedia
applications.

"It's important for the information technology community to
think outside the box," advises Philip Dodds, president of
the Interactive Multimedia Association, a trade group in Annapolis,
Md. "Multimedia applications will develop from areas we're
not even thinking about-things we haven't used a computer for
before." That's why, in Dodds' view, businesses need to become
more creative in encouraging the daily use of PCs.

Several factors will help drive multimedia into mainstream corporate
America. The vendor community is working hard to improve such
still-immature technologies as video compression. More software
and hardware companies are banding together and promoting open
multimedia standards. Systems manufacturers are building more
systems pre-loaded with multimedia hardware, obviating the
need to spend corporate dollars for add-on software.

But perhaps the biggest force in multimedia in business is the
declining price of systems that have sufficient computing power
to run multimedia applications. Pentium-based PCs were selling
early in 1995 at an average of $2,200; by early 1996 they will
be priced at least $500 lower. That's important, because while
most businesses use a version of Microsoft Windows on the desktop,
most multimedia Windows applications don't work well on PCs
that run on microprocessor platforms less powerful than Pentiums.

Price wars broke out among makers of Pentium-based systems in
the last quarter of 1995 and are expected to continue into
1996. Intel, which produces the Pentium chip, says it will
cut prices again on Feb. 1, which should continue to fuel system
price drops.

Also, computer manufacturers now build systems with multimedia
in mind. For example, in October IBM unveiled its PC Series
Model 330 containing a 75-MHz Pentium microprocessor with 8
Mbytes of RAM and a 540-Mbyte hard drive for $1,660-just a
few hundred dollars more than a powerful 486 PC system. That
Pentium PC ships with 2 Mbytes of video RAM and a CD-ROM drive.

Hugh Hendrick, IS manager for the City of San Mateo, Calif.,notes
that even budget-crunched municipalities are now buying Pentiums.
"Most new systems we're buying are Pentiums," says Hendrick.
"They're so cheap." But how many of these Pentium PCs include
multimedia? That depends on the cost of add-on hardware, says
Hendrick. "As these features become more common and you see
more bundles, people will get more motivated," he adds.

Growing Trend

Several manufacturers already have announced multimedia bundling
a trend that should grow in 1996. Tatung Co. of America Inc.
in Long Beach, Calif., recently rolled out the Uniq 5510, a
100-MHz Pentium PC with Super Graphics Video Array (SVGA),
a Creative Labs sound card, a CD-ROM drive, 16 Mbytes of RAM,
2 Mbytes of video RAM, a 540-Mbyte hard drive, and a software
utility that sets resolution and color depth. Total price:
$2,688.

In December, Sigma Designs Inc. in Fremont, Calif., announced
a deal with Zenon Technology Inc. to pre-install Sigma MPEG
accelerator cards in Zenon's Pentium systems. Because it includes
standard Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) video-compression
technology, Zenon's $2,000, 75-MHz Pentium Interactive MPEG
system (which comes with 16 Mbytes of RAM, a 1-Gbyte hard drive,
and quad-speed CD-ROM drive) can process TV-quality video and
CD-quality sound without add-on cards.

Some vendors are bundling multimedia hardware and software.
Compaq says it will ship PCs with ProShare, Intel's desktop
video- and teleconferencing software, by late 1997. The two
companies say they need nearly two years to figure out how
best to bundle conferencing and keep systems costs low.

Several manufacturers are jointly developing open standards
for multimedia technology. One of the most important is the
adoption of the MPEG video-compression standard, which is being
pushed by the MPEG consortium, a group sanctioned by the International
Standards Organization in Paris. MPEG helps networked systems
move large video images more easily and eliminates the jerky,
unpolished look of video that runs on PCs. The more vendors
that adopt MPEG technology, the lower the cost and the more
compatible various systems will become.

Microsoft's Windows 95 desktop operating system is expected
to gain MPEG support this year. But industry observers note
one major problem with MPEG software: It requires that the
microprocessor do most of the work, making the technology suitable
only for high-end Pentium machines. Thus, the adoption of MPEG
software rests on the affordability of those systems.

But MPEG's real growth will come from corporate acceptance of
videoconferencing."These systems are almost as common as a
copy machine for global companies," notes Dusty Sykes, a consultant
at Vanguard Communications in Morris Plains, N.J.

Eric Goldreich, IS manager at law firm Sheppard, Mullen, Richter
& Hampton in Los Angeles, plans to purchase a Concord videoconferencing
system from PictureTel Corp. in Danvers, Mass., early in 1996.
Notes Goldreich, "If I have just 10 lawyers who don't have
to fly from San Francisco to L.A. for a meeting every month,
the system pays for itself." The cost of operating Concord
about $2,800 a month-is "less than it was a few years ago,"
says Goldreich.

In 1996, businesses can expect more portable conferencing systems
at more affordable prices. Analysts predict systems makers
will start to market PC notebooks with color LCD screens, high
quality sound, and CD-ROM drives in the $2,000 price range.
Improved video on portable systems may affect how some sales
and marketing professionals work. Soon, business will experiment
with video presentations or videoconferences on the road.

After all, as more workers install multimedia Pentium or PowerPC
machines at home, the more they'll come to expect the power
and glitz of multimedia at work.

Visual Tools: Constructing Better Visuals -- Low-end visual development tools
will use new operating systems to offer high-end features

By:
Sean Gallagher

Once upon a time, visual development tools could be categorized
easily. At the low end were tools like Microsoft's Visual Basic
and Powersoft Corp.'s PowerBuilder. Developers could use these
products to quickly build desktop applications or front ends
for databases, but such products lacked management tools and
facilities for large team development. At the high end, tools
such as Forte from Forte Software Inc. and Dynasty from Dynasty
Technologies Inc., could build three-tier applications and
had the enterprise architecture that the low-end tools lacked,
but carried a hefty price tag.

But 1996 will see those class distinctions fade away as the
low-end tools of yesterday gain many of the features of enterprise
class development tools. New releases of PowerBuilder, Visual
Basic, Borland International Inc.'s Delphi, and Gupta Corp.'s
Centura-a 32-bit successor to SQLWindows-will ship this year,
putting new power into the hands of Windows developers for
a fraction of the price of their heavyweight cousins.

Two major new technologies will push these tools into the world
of full-scale enterprise development: standard object models
for both the desktop and distributed environments, and structured
methodologies for building large-scale applications. At the
same time, built-in compilers will make the performance of
these tools closer to that of third-generation languages (3GLs)
like C++

Visual tools are coming of age partly because operating systems
are finally up to the task. Visual Basic 4.0 and the upcoming
32-bit releases of Delphi version 2.0, PowerBuilder 5.0, and
Centura will run as native applications on Microsoft's Windows
95 and Windows NT operating systems. Besides being more stable
than Windows 3.1, these operating systems offer an object model
for applications to interact with-Microsoft's OLE 2.0 object
technology.

OLE controls (OCXs) are now the standard components for assembling
Visual Basic applications. Since all the development tools
being written to the Windows 95 standard will be able to use
OCXs, the OCX market is likely to explode this year, giving
applications everything from database access controls to built
in Internet functionality.

The OLE object model also turns OLE 2.0-compliant software-including
applications written in Visual Basic 4.0 and the upcoming visual
tools-into components that can be embedded in or linked to
other OLE 2.0 applications. This level of application integration
comes at a price: Many developers consider OLE too big and
too slow. But it opens a number of possibilities to users of
visual tools, including a means to partition client-server
applications.

Distributed OLE

The first visual tool to take full advantage of OLE 2.0 was
Microsoft's Visual Basic 4.0, introduced in September. The
centerpiece of Visual Basic 4.0 is its remote automation object
technology, based on Microsoft's distributed extension of the
OLE object model. This technology will be released separately
in 1996 as Network OLE.

The distributed extension to the OLE standard supports communications
between applications and objects across a network as though
they were running on the same machine. OLE automation objects
thus become server applications, pushing visual tools into
the realm of multitier client-server development.

Three-tier client-server applications are partitioned into client
and multiple server components to ease management headaches
and to increase performance. Most of the business logic computing
is handled by a shared object running on an application server,
while the client is reduced to handling little more than how
the data is entered and displayed.

Network OLE will make communications between application server
objects and client front ends part of the same interprocess
communications structure that handles communications between
Windows applications on the same computer. Network OLE will
use an established technology to do this: remote procedure
calls (RPCs)

Gupta's SQLWindows and other visual development tools have had
the capability to pass RPCs for some time, but they often require
coding in C or C++ to fully exploit RPCs. Network OLE wraps
RPCs in an easily digestible form, removing much of the pain
of developing with it.

So far, only Visual Basic leverages this technology directly.
But other visual tools can use Visual Basic as network plumbing
by acting as remote automation objects for Visual Basic applications.
Once Microsoft makes distributed OLE part of its operating
system, any OLE-supporting tool will be able to hook into Network
OLE.

Microsoft also is teaming with Software AG to port OLE integration
to Unix, VMS, and MVS systems. But some vital elements are
missing from Microsoft's object model-for one, it lacks a tool,
such as an object broker or an object repository, to manage
the networked objects.

Visual Basic also lacks a built-in methodology for designing
code, and despite its new version-control capabilities, it
still strikes high-end developers as too undisciplined in its
framework for large-scale development. Also, because Visual
Basic uses a run-time interpreter rather than compiled binary
code to run its applications, it suffers a performance hit
that is worsened by OLE 2.0's sluggishness.

The next release of Visual Basic will address some of these
issues by adding a compiler. In addition, Microsoft will initiate
a partner program for third-party developers of management,
computer-aided software engineering (CASE), and distributed
tools.

Delphi was touted by Borland during its initial development
as a Visual Basic killer. While it hasn't swept Visual Basic
from the field, Delphi has won over many Microsoft customers
and established a niche for building fast, tight, desktop database
centric applications.

What made Delphi hot in 1995 will make it hotter in 1996. It
manages to balance the flexibility and power of an object-oriented
programming language with the speed of a rapid applications
development tool, and it has strong database integration features.

But Delphi has also grown into something more. The next release
of Delphi-version 2.0-will take further advantage of its Object
Pascal language's 3GL roots in the 32-bit realm and leapfrog
many of the enterprise features of Visual Basic. There will
be three versions of the tool: Delphi Desktop for individual
developers, Delphi Developer for professional LAN-based developers,
and Delphi Client/Server Suite for client-server developers.

The developer and client-server versions will include both development
management tools often associated with the high end of the
applications development market: an object repository for sharing
reusable forms and other objects, a data dictionary for standardized
data types, direct support for Intersolv's PVCS version-control
software, and a source-code library of visual controls.

Another new feature incorporated into the two high-end versions
of Delphi will be the Open Tools API, an applications programming
interface that's designed for integrating Delphi with CASE
tools, version-control systems, and third-party experts (as
Borland calls its automated helpers). The client-server edition
also will include tools specific to the world of two-tier development.
One of these is SQL Explorer, which allows developers to browse
and edit the configuration of domains, triggers, and stored
procedures on any supported database server.

But when it comes to three-tier computing, Borland has decided
to let others manage the details. The Scotts Valley, Calif.,
company has not implemented its own application partitioning
architecture; instead, it will exploit Microsoft's Network
OLE for three-tier client-server applications.

Three Platforms

Powersoft's PowerBuilder 5.0, which will ship before the summer,
adds both application partitioning and the capability to compile
code. PowerBuilder also brings with it the best inherent cross
platform capabilities-it's the only visual tool of the four
that can deploy applications on Unix and the Macintosh, as
well as on Windows.

At the same time, PowerBuilder's limitations fall somewhere
between Visual Basic's and Delphi's-it is neither as flexible
as Delphi nor as easy to use as Visual Basic. This will change
with its upcoming support of Microsoft's OLE 2.0 and OCX standards
and its growing library of objects.

Powersoft, rather than rely on Microsoft to provide the plumbing
for three-tier applications, is building its own multiplatform
model for distributed objects. Within PowerBuilder 5.0, developers
will be able to deploy PowerBuilder objects on Windows NT,
Unix, or Macintosh and use Powersoft's own object request broker
to establish communications between applications and distributed
objects. Powersoft's Practical Application Partitioning strategy,
which revolves around its object request broker, will let PowerBuilder
developers move objects to application servers, compile them
as executable programs on the server platform, and manage connections
between applications and objects through a transport object
running on a designated server. While this method of object
brokering is proprietary, the Concord, Mass., company has designed
its architecture to plug into a standard Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (Corba) system in the future.

PowerBuilder 5.0 will compile to native binary code by first
generating C code, then passing that code behind the scenes
to the Watcom 32-bit C compiler. While this will give PowerBuilder
applications better performance, developers won't be able to
access or modify the generated C code to tune or debug it.
Gupta isn't moving its SQLWindows platform to the 32-bit environment.
Instead, the Menlo Park, Calif., company is rewriting its 16
bit product, creating a completely new underlying architecture.
Gupta is hedging its bets in some ways. The company will continue
to offer its 16-bit SQLWindows 5.0 product for two-tier client
server development and will incorporate many Centura features.

Centura will be positioned as a higher-end product than SQLWindows,
with Gupta's sights set on competing in the same arena as Forte
and Dynasty. In December, Gupta announced a partnership with
Open Environment Corp. of Boston to produce a three-tier technology
for its SQLWindows and Centura products. The three-tier product,
called QuickRPC, will let Gupta applications use Open Environment's
three-tier and Distributed Computing Environment application
architectures. Gupta also will provide connections between
its development tools and transaction processing monitors such
as Novell's Tuxedo. To automate the partitioning of Centura
applications, Gupta will provide a three-tier wizard, similar
to the wizards in Microsoft's desktop applications.

Centura will include an open object repository and data modeling
and source code management capabilities. Gupta is teaming with
Rational Software Corp. to incorporate Rational's Rose CASE
tool into the 32-bit product, and is building on the team development
technologies of Gupta's TeamWindows product.

The Centura language, like SQLWindows, will be fully object
oriented. Gupta will expand its current partial compilation
to compile all object code into dynamically linked libraries,
and users will be able to build fully compiled OCXs-none of
the other tools currently does this.

As these once low-end tools push into three-tier computing,
they may make good on some long unfulfilled promises from structured
tools-and at a lower price.

Programming Languages: Java Makes The Web Perform -- Sun's fledgling 
programming language for the Internet is drawing a crowd of client-server
software developers

By:
Jason Levitt

Imagine if the cost of maintaining client software on your corporate
desktops were reduced to a fraction of its current level. What
if your networked applications automatically came in versions
for Windows, Macintosh, and X Window? Perhaps you'd like to
run your client application no matter where you were or what
machine you happened to be using.

This could be the near future of client-server software on the
Internet if Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language
achieves its potential. Not bad for a product that was originally
developed as an embedded language for consumer appliances and
was virtually unknown a year ago. But with an Internet-crazy
industry hungry for adding portability, two-way interactivity,
and flexible content to the rather static pages of the World
Wide Web, Java is the right technology at the right time.

Java (it's not an acronym; the name was chosen to convey a sense
of liveliness and interactivity) owes much of its notoriety
to Netscape Communications Corp., whose decision to license
the Java run-time interpreter for inclusion in Navigator 2.0,
the most widely used Web browser, created enthusiasm among
developers. Although there are no shipping commercial applications
based on Java, or even a release version of the software development
kit for creating such applications, companies such as Applix,
Eastman Kodak, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, and Starfish (headed by
ex-Borland International chairman Philippe Kahn) are all aggressively
pursuing Java software development and integration with their
existing products. Additionally, such companies as Borland,
IBM, Macromedia, Metrowerks, Microsoft, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon
Graphics, and Spyglass have licensed source code for the Java
run-time interpreter so they can create clients capable of
executing Java applets, applications written in a subset of
the Java language designed for use in Web pages. Individuals
and small developers are also making their presence known by
posting their Java applets on Sun's main Java Internet site
(http://java.sun.com)

Portability and security-both at the top of the information
systems manager's most wanted list-were important considerations
in Java's development.

Java applets are highly portable, reducing both maintenance
and time-to-market for multiplatform applications. Developers
need to write the application only once. A single compiled
applet will run identically on any platform that has a Java
enabled browser.

Java applet portability is accomplished through the Java run
time execution environment and the class libraries used for
applet programming, which isolate the applets from architecture
specific knowledge of the execution platform. For example,
applets don't know if the screen they're writing to is managed
by Windows or MacOS; they simply write to a display object
that has generic screen attributes. Although generic objects
limit the developer's ability to access platform-specific features
(such as advanced screen drawing on the Macintosh), using generic
objects increases portability. To support a new platform, only
the Java run-time execution environment needs to be ported
to the new platform.

Java is an interpreted language. But unlike most interpreted
languages, which are executed directly from source code, Java
applets are compiled into an architecture-neutral bytecode
format, which is smaller and more efficient to interpret than
source code. Once compiled, the applets sit on the Web server
waiting for a Java-enabled browser to download them. When the
applets are downloaded to the browser, the run-time interpreter
inside the browser executes the applet code.

To quell the security concerns of users, Sun has placed limits
and controls on the resources available to applets. For example,
an applet is permitted to establish network connections only
with its originating host, and it cannot create new processes.
Local file system access is very limited, but there is no agreement
among browser vendors on how to restrict file system access.
Sun's HotJava browser uses Access Control Lists to limit file
system access, while Netscape's Navigator 2.0, which is still
in beta, allows no access at all. Kim Polese, marketing manager
for Java, concedes that Sun has not reached an agreement with
Netscape on security implementation details. "We're working
with Netscape [and the other Java licensees] to have more browser
consistency with the security options that are available,"
Polese says.

Java-enabled browsers assume that any applet is untrusted, and
so they first pass the applet through the Java Bytecode Verifier
to ensure that it doesn't violate any security rules. They
then run the the Java Class Loader to verify that the applet
doesn't try to spoof an existing class or otherwise try to
extend the applet in a bogus manner.

Unfortunately, simply specifying these two security mechanisms
isn't satisfying potential Java users. Companies need assurances
that all Java-enabled browsers will faithfully adhere to the
security measures. So to further placate Java security worriers,
Sun has instituted a Java-compatible logo, which is enforced
contractually with the licensees of the Java run-time interpreter.
Products from licensees must pass a test suite to ensure that
all applets will run with everyone's interpreters, and interpreters
will faithfully enforce security precautions.

What's Brewing

While it appears that many developers are taking a wait-and
see attitude toward Java, some, such as Applix in Westboro,
Mass., are jumping in quickly. Applix, known for its ApplixWare
office productivity tools for Unix and Windows NT-including
integrated spreadsheet, E-mail, graphics, and real-time data
collection tools-claims to have developed the first Java-based
client-server spreadsheet.

Applix took the spreadsheet component of ApplixWare, which is
not a client-server application, and rewrote the user interface
portion in Java, using Java's network communications abilities
so that a client could communicate with the spreadsheet, which
would be maintained and updated on a server. The calculation
and data-access engines were left on the server to keep the
client side simple. The Java-based spreadsheet looks very much
like the ApplixWare spreadsheet, but the Java version can run
on any platform that has a Java-enabled browser.

An additional benefit of this Java-based ApplixWare component
is simplified network updates of the application. Since Java
applets are downloaded from the server before executing on
the client, updates can be made by simply updating the components
on the server. No intervention on the client side is necessary;
when the client executes the applet, the current version is
automatically downloaded from the server.

"We have a range of customers who are interested in this network
centric computing model where there is very little client-side
maintenance," says Mark Yohai, director of Internet applications
for Applix. Yohai expects to offer a demo version of Applix's
spreadsheet applet soon from its Web site (http://www.applix.com
) though he was unable to say when the product will be released.

Starfish is making a Java applet out of the group-scheduling
component of its popular Sidekick networked contacts manager.
The result will be that wide area, multiplatform, group scheduling
is easily accomplished via the Internet. Then, even people
without Sidekick can participate in group scheduling by downloading
the applet and executing it in their Java-enabled Web browser.

"The big problem with workgroup products in the past," says
Starfish CEO Kahn, "is that you had to have the client program
to participate, but the problem is that participants don't
always have the client program."

Though both Starfish and Applix have offered convincing demos,
users have yet to see any serious applications hit the market,
despite the excitement over Java technology. Part of the problem
is that most Java development tools are still crude. Some significant
development tools have been announced, however.

Symantec is offering Java support in Expresso, an add-on tool
to its C++ development environment. Borland says it will deliver
Latte technology, a visual programming environment for Java,
in several stages, with the first commercial release scheduled
to ship by June.

Also, Natural Intelligence Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. expects
to ship its Applet Development Kit for the Macintosh, code
named Roaster, in January. Roaster will include a Java compiler
and an applet testing environment. Sun also expects its Java
software development kit for Windows 95 and NT and Solaris
to ship in January, with Sun's Macintosh development kit going
into beta about the same time.

Too Attractive To Ignore

With applications still to be delivered and nagging concerns
about security, Java has yet to prove itself. Nevertheless,
the speed at which the technology is being adopted, coupled
with the promise of greatly reduced costs, are proving too
attractive to ignore.

Java has no real competitors at the moment. But when Microsoft's
Internet publishing system becomes generally available in the
first quarter of 1996, it will offer an alternate-though not
necessarily an incompatible-development choice. Microsoft has
announced it will add Java run-time support to its Internet
Explorer browser, though there is no indication that Microsoft
will add Java support to its Internet Studio design tool.

Microsoft's strategy may have a number of advantages initially,
mainly the ability to share downloaded OLE Controls (OCXs)
with OLE-enabled applications on PCs. But unlike Java applets,
OCXs are platform-specific, which puts a greater burden on
the developer to provide versions of OCXs for each client platform.

Sun has already published on its Web site pertinent APIs and
specifications for both the Java language and the run-time
execution environment. According to Sun's Polese, these specs
allow developers to write Java interpreters or language implementations,
therefore calming fears that Sun will be the sole source of
Java technology.

New tools, such as the Expresso Grinder compiler (http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de
~espresso), developed by Martin Odersky, a professor at the
University of Karlsruhe, Germany, that claims to translate
Java programs into Java bytecode format much faster than the
compiler supplied by Sun, are proof that at least some of the
specs are usable.

Hot Skills In '96 -- Internet, client-server, and networking
experts top lists of the most wanted



The hot talent in information systems in 1996 will be people
who know the Internet, client-server computing, or networking,
hiring executives say. Nudged out of the spotlight but still
much in demand will be SAP R/3 and Lotus Notes experts.

The fortunate ones with the coveted skills may not only find
it easier to land a job but could also wangle a higher salary.
Plus, IS people with strong business ability could be in demand
for new hybrid posts.

It's no surprise that the hottest area in computers-the Internet
is creating demand for Internet skills. The supply isn't expected
to match the demand.

"IS organizations are looking for people experienced in working
with the Internet, particularly regarding security issues and
building firewalls," says Vic Janulaitis, CEO of Positive Support
Review, an IS consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif. Other
Internet skills in demand include familiarity with tools for
creating splashy Internet products.

In the client-server arena, expertise in C++ programming still
will be in heavy demand. But so will dexterity with other development
languages and object programming tools.

Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. in Dallas, which is migrating from mainframe
to client-server computing, is seeking expertise in Visual
Basic, Forte, and Oracle software, says Trey Bradley, chief
information officer. He hopes to upgrade the skills of the
existing staff, but will look outside for hard-to-find people
like Forte developers.

Meanwhile, Greg Scileppi, executive director of RHI Consulting,
the Menlo Park, Calif., technical services arm of job-placement
firm Robert Half International, says he is getting heavy requests
for workers with client-server skills such as expertise in
front-end graphical user interfaces, relational databases,
and help-desk support.

Other IS organizations are looking for expertise in older software
on new platforms-for example, IBM DB2 database software on
Windows NT.

State Street Bank of Boston is searching for "networking expertise
that runs the gamut, including peer-to-peer networking," says
CIO David Sexton.

Job experts say it isn't unusual for a programmer who would
otherwise be paid $50,000 to $60,000 a year to see an extra
$10,000 to $20,000 tacked on for rare skills.

Pat Roberts, president of Professional Training Services Inc.
in King of Prussia, Pa., says some of her large corporate clients
are creating roles for people with "exceptional business, operational,
and technical understanding."

Some companies are appointing liaisons between business units
and the IS organization. Roberts says these posts are often
filled by someone with "good people and business skills" from
the IS organization, or someone with solid technical skills
from the business unit.

In Short: On A Health Kick



Two health-care companies have named chief information officers.
NovaCare Inc., a King of Prussia, Pa., provider of rehabilitation
and nursing services, appointed Steven Wise VP of information
systems and CIO, succeeding Paul Ross, who the company says

in 1993 as director of systems and programming. Meanwhile,
Genesis Health Ventures Inc. in Kennett Square, Pa., named

In Short: A First For Witco



Chemical Maker Witco Corp. in Greenwich, Conn., made Ronald
Edelstein its first chief information officer. Edelstein, who
joined the petroleum products manufacturer in 1991, had been
Witco's general manager of information systems. Witco says
it decided to create the CIO post because "the use of data"
is the manufacturer's "most important variable."

The Secret CIO: What's Hot Versus What's Not -- 1996 promises hype, chic 
trends, and maybe even some really useful tools

By:
Herbert W. Lovelace

Even if you are not paying attention to the calendar, it is
still easy to notice when the end of a year is reached. Forget
the traditional indicators: holiday parties and general ledger
system problems. The new year is signaled by magazines' guesses
about what the next 12 months will bring. Reading these predictions
takes your mind off of worrying whether you held down December
spending enough to avoid blowing the annual systems budget.

It would be fascinating if the magazines also wrote about how
accurate their past projections have been. For instance, whatever
happened to CASE and expert systems? And how many times can
you read about the coming of asynchronous transfer mode? You
get the idea.

Another approach would be to compare Chic Hot with Actual Hot.
Chic Hot is what we talk about when we go to meetings with
other chief information officers. Actual Hot is what we're
really doing. In 1995, reengineering and data warehousing were
Chic Hot. If we changed a system to combine two reports we
called it reengineering, and any use of existing information
was called data warehousing.

In 1996, reengineering and data warehousing should continue
as strong contenders in the Chic Hot category. Joining them
will be objects and the ever-popular Windows 95-which will
probably win the Lovelace Verbiage Ratio Award. The LVRA goes
to that product with the highest ratio of printed word to corporate
use. With the exception of Dow Chemical rolling out Win95 and
Ford doing what they call a test (on more machines than most
of us possess), the consensus of my friends has been that it's
not ready for prime time, but will still garner as much media
fervor as the O.J. Simpson trial.

Actual Hot is more difficult to predict, but it is clear that
SAP's R/3 software will continue to gain momentum. If you haven't
yet considered it, take a look; your boss will expect you to
be able to explain why it is, or is not, good for your company.
Lack of familiarity with R/3 could be a career-limiting move.

Crawling Fruit

The Internet hype will start to bear fruit as businesspeople
look for ways to move knowledge of their products onto the
Net and gain an edge on their competition. The entire class
of tools that addresses Internet security will be big. Bad
things can happen to good people without proper firewalls and
carefully considered security plans. Java, one true application
of object technology, should be really hot. Java, if you have
not had a chance to investigate it, is a programming language
that, among other things, can embed animation into HTML pages.

Finally, World Wide Web spiders and people who know how to use
them will become big late next year. A spider, which is a program
such as Lycos that goes out on the Net to find the information
you want, is essential to using the Net intelligently. MetaCrawler,
which automatically searches other spiders, is really interesting,
although it opens all sorts of ownership and other legal issues.

Hope you had a happy New Year. Cindy and I relaxed in front
of the fireplace, and I did not even dwell on Kratmeyer's request
that we install a Win95 data warehouse in International Operations
to support his reengineering effort. I wish he would stop reading
airline magazines.

Desktop Agenda: The Parts Bill Left Out -- Microsoft bugs help exhume deleted
material from The Road Ahead

By:
Stephen Manes

Everybody's making predictions, so here's mine: History will
rank Bill Gates as an author right up there with one of his
personal favorites-Robert James Waller, the man who wrote The
Bridges Of Madison County. No one with a heart could possibly
remain unmoved at the poignant images in Bill's book The Road
Ahead (Viking, 1995). I almost shed a tear as I read this:
"Stallion, she thought, as his fingers eagerly caressed both
buttons of her Microsoft mouse. Stallion, she knew, as all
at once he manfully manipulated the Control, Alt, and Delete
keys of her Microsoft Natural Keyboard."

Actually, that passage didn't make it into the book. But as
I reported in The New York Times, security lapses in Microsoft's
OLE object technology make Office files suck up deleted data
from your hard drive unless you're using Windows NT (Microsoft
issued a fix for the problem on Dec. 6). Besides, when you
use the "fast save" option with Microsoft Word, your deletions
stay in the file.

I predict that thanks to these amazing "features," sources may
soon treat us to portions of the book that were deleted before
it reached the presses. Before you curse Microsoft for causing
your deleted rants to reappear in E-mail messages you've sent
across the Net, give thanks that its incompetence may have
kept alive the parts of Bill's book that he left out.

In the book itself, for example, Gates is stingy with credit.
His fellow billionaire Paul Allen receives his due for helping
develop the original Microsoft Basic, but the "third man" on
that project, programmer Monte Davidoff, isn't mentioned. The
Parts Left Out will reveal that Gates actually cited everyone
whose work he borrowed, but the bibliography was mysteriously
omitted at the last moment.

The book explains some of the electronic novelties of the huge
house Gates is building, such as pictures and music that can
follow guests around like an obsequious puppy. The Parts Left
Out will disclose the shocking news that although most of the
house's systems are based on Windows NT, the windows themselves
will be controlled by a variant of IBM's OS/2 system that did
so well with airport baggage in Denver.

Shirts And Suits

In The Road Ahead, Gates writes that "Soon there will be computerized
shirt-making machines that will obey a different set of instructions
for every shirt ... It is conceivable that within a few years
everyone will have measurements registered electronically so
it will be easy to find out how well a ready-made item will
fit, or to place a custom order." The Parts Left Out will reveal
that every article of clothing Gates has worn since 1991 was
produced by a top-secret Microsoft system that also cuts and
styles his hair.

The book discusses a "full bodysuit" that can reproduce tactile
sensations. The Parts Left Out will disclose that Microsoft
has had a prototype under development for years. Programmers
who volunteered for the project will declare they have experienced
bliss-for the first time in their lives.

Gates writes that he thinks of a "wallet PC" as a "new Swiss
Army knife" that will serve as "a camera, a pocket tape recorder,
a cellular phone, a pager, concert tickets, a map, a compass,
a calculator," and "perhaps a loud whistle to summon help."
The Parts Left Out will show that the only part of the prototype
that works is the whistle, though breakthroughs are expected
in nail-file and scissors technology.

An Industry (Touchstone/Simon and Schuster)

Object Technology: Make Software Fit Business -- Business software should be 
designed to help users do their jobs-not dictate their actions

By:
Robert Morison

The Internet is dramatically changing our view of information
access. As Net users, we are learning to find the information
we want, or even suspect exists, using generic tools. This
information-centric model is gathering momentum as we enter
the new year.

Yet most corporate information systems aren't built to participate
in the flow of new information, or to capitalize on the creativity
unleashed by it. As corporations, we're still tied to the predetermined
data regurgitated by cumbersome applications whose design centers
are actually automation, not information.

This situation cannot continue; the business world is changing
too fast. The purpose of business software is overdue for radical
rethinking. To date, software has been used to organize information
to automate processes. Instead, software should organize information
for communication and understanding, creating a model of the
business that can be used in many ways. Implementing this change
is a primary challenge for IS organizations in 1996 and beyond.

What's wrong with today's business software? Take a simple example
 a telephone call to a mail-order outfit. A typical sequence
 I'm put on hold ... I listen to canned sincerity telling me
how important my call is to them ... a representative then
asks for the customer codes on the mailing label ... I say
the catalog is in my wife's name and was sent to our former
address, and therefore does little to identify me ... I'm asked
to supply credit-card information, address, and phone number
 ... I'm finally allowed to name the item I want ... it's out
of stock.

What's going on? The rep's work has been automated. The company
designed the "best" way to handle orders, then implemented
it in software. Now, the rep is enslaved by a system that is
unfriendly to customers, demeaning to the rep's intelligence,
and ultimately unproductive.

Do your systems also impose one right way of doing things on
a variable world? Let's face it: There is no single best way
of doing anything-and there's no longer any such thing as a
stable transaction-processing system.

Ugly Complexity

The focus of business software must change to give people useful
packets of information and functionality. Software shouldn't
try to impose order; it should model the business in its ugly
complexity.

When the business changes, you use the model differently or
modify only what needs to change. Software shouldn't dictate
workers' actions; it should model their domains and respect
their intelligence in deciding how to act. That way, my mail
order rep could build an order that satisfies us both.

The technology for creating this software is, of course, object
orientation. These tools provide a natural means for organizing
software into useful packets, which is important because it
encourages business modeling. Paradoxically, the only way to
build a large, dynamic business model is bottom-up, learning
about the business and the model as you go.

These notions of software are overdue for implementation. For
years, we've been fooling ourselves that we're making progress
by dabbling in object technology and implementing option-laden
applications. But we're still reautomating.

We won't turn the corner until we change the approach. So here's
a New Year's resolution: All new software must model rather
than automate; it's the only way to cope with business change.
We must also change the intent. We shouldn't aim to "get it
right," but simply to "get it."

Technological advance-increasing processor and communications
power, multimedia, the Internet-is creating an exciting new
venue. But without redefining their software, corporations
continue playing catch against the stoop. We can't imagine
what the business world will be like when people have access
to robust business models. But it'll be different, it'll be
exciting, and companies that create models early and well will
enjoy a competitive advantage.
