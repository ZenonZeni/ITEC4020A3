<p>
MEDICUS is aware that many people, including those currently covered, do not fully understand what Private Medical Insurance really offers. Different plans offer widely differing ranges of protection. The cheapest premiums often indicate very limited cover. It can lead to financial disaster to imagine you are fully covered only to find out too late that you are not. We suggest the following questions 
should always be asked when considering Private Medical Insurance.
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><br>
Q. <b>When I have a legitimate claim do I have to pay any part of that claim myself ?<br><br></b>
A. Some companies ask you to pay the first part of each and every claim. Some companies place limits on the amount you can claim for any particular form of treatment or condition. Although these restrictions will bring down the cost of your insurance, MEDICUS believes this to be the wrong approach and places no limit on claims for eligible treatment and charges no excess on eligible claims. We prefer to
 control costs by efficient and effective administrative procedures.<p>
<li><br>
Q.<b> Am I covered for costs both in and out of hospital ?<br><br></b>
A. Some plans exclude cover unless you are actually in hospital. Some only cover you for treatment that leads to hospitalisation. Although you may be able to afford to pay your own consultancy fees, you should remember that you will probably visit a consultant or have out patient treatment far more often than you are likely to be admitted to hospital. MEDICUS believes out patient specialist consultations
 and out patient treatment to be a major part of full medical cover and puts no limits on the amount you can claim for eligible treatment in these areas.<br>
<li><br>
Q. <b>Do I qualify for private cover if the NHS can treat me quickly ?<br><br></b>
A. With some plans you do and with some you do not. Many plans only offer cover if the NHS cannot treat you within six weeks. This inevitably means that the more serious conditions tend to be treated by the NHS and your cover does not come into effect. MEDICUS believes that private treatment offers both speed and greater comfort and privacy. When we are seriously ill, that comfort and privacy becomes even
 more important. Speed of treatment is always important, but full cover should also guarantee private treatment for every eligible condition. 
MEDICUS covers you for every eligible condition whether or not the NHS can treat you quickly.<br>
<li><br>
Q. <b>What is eligible treatment ?<br><br></b>
A. All plans exclude certain conditions. These include chronic illnesses, cosmetic treatment, treatment by a General Practitioner and treatment for self imposed conditions. In these respects, MEDICUS is much in line with other plans. We, naturally, have to exclude a condition that existed prior to application.  
Most plans place you in a hospital “band”. If you want treatment available in the most expensive hospitals you will be asked to pay higher premiums. Many plans exclude the most expensive hospitals altogether. If you choose, or need to be treated in a hospital outside your band, you will be expected to pay the difference in cost yourself. Where your condition is best treated in a hospital outside your 
band this can produce a serious dilemma. You will have either to pay the difference, settle for another hospital or rely on the NHS.<br>
<p>
MEDICUS entitles you to treatment in over 100 nominated hospitals countrywide (see
page 6 for full explanation).
<p>
The only restriction on the consultant you use is that he must be prepared to use one of our Preferred Hospitals. However, if your condition requires you to go to a hospital outside this list, for medical reasons, then subject to prior authorisation, you are fully covered and you pay nothing yourself. We believe this system offers greater protection than the banded system. As long as you understand and use the system correctly you will never have to pay one penny for an eligible claim with PRIORITY CARE, even if your condition requires treatment in the most 
expensive hospital.<br>
<li><br>
Q. <b>When I need treatment, how can I be sure I am covered ?<br><br></b>
A. Experience has shown that with some plans the answer is that you cannot be sure. Once you have had the treatment and made a claim, there is often little you can do if you discover that for some reason your claim is not eligible.<br>
MEDICUS, through our administrators, offer a counselling service to help with this problem. You must speak to one of our counsellors as soon as your General Practitioner recommends treatment or consultation. In this way your claim is authorised in advance and there is never any chance of unexpected bills.
<li><br>
Q. <b>What happens in the case of a dispute ?<br><br></b>
A. Unlike most plans, with MEDICUS your contract is directly with Lloyd’s Underwriters. This means that should you not agree with any decision made, you have direct access to the Insurance Ombudsman. Of course we hope and believe this will never happen, but it is always comforting to know your rights are independently protected in this way at all times.<br>
