The Department of Mechanical Engineering opened its first engineering
laboratory in 1892.  Since that day it has continued to enjoy a
reputation of housing some of the finest research laboratories in
Canada, and indeed in the world, in a broad range of disciplines
relating to Mechanical Engineering.  Over the years, the thrust and
the emphasis of the Department's activities has changed to reflect 
priorities within our society.  Our current activities remain
broad-based, but particular areas of activity include manufacturing,
robotics, mechanical design, biomechanical engineering and environmental
studies.  These specific areas are supplimented by the fundamental
and traditional areas of Mechanical Engineering which include mechanics,
thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, dynamics and materials science.<p>
