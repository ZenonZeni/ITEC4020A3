<h4>Pension funds performed well in 1993</h4>

<p>The 1993 investment performance survey of the Belgian Association of Pension Funds indicated an average return of 20.6%, compared with 7.5% for 1992. The favourable result, ie some 18% net of inflation, can be explained by the excellent performance of both the equity and bond markets during 1993.  This is in sharp contrast to the first half of 1994, which shows negative returns for almost all asset classes.

<h4><a name="be2">Flat-rate taxation of ex-gratia pension lump sums confirmed</a></h4>

<p>A new law rectifies an oversight in the tax law of 28 December 1992. It has now been confirmed that lump sums from ex-gratia pension promises are taxable at a flat rate of 16.5%, plus crisis and communal taxes. (Crisis tax is an additional tax of 3% on top of normal income tax). Previously, because of the oversight, such lump sums had to be taxed at progressive rates.  The new measure applies to the 1994 tax year, ie to income obtained in 1993.

<h4>Pension plan surplus moratorium extended</h4>

<p>Employers should assess their funding policy in the light of the extended moratorium on recovery of surplus assets from Canadian pension plans. Since 1988, this moratorium has been in place to preclude employer recovery of surplus assets (unless two-thirds of plan members agree to such a recovery). The moratorium was due to lapse on 31 December 1994 but has now been extended to 31 December 1997. It affects all pension plans registered in Ontario.

<h4><a name="ca2">Ontario's Employment Equity Act announced</a></h4>

<p>From 1 September 1994, employers will be required to develop plans to ensure employment equity for designated groups, including women, people with disabilities, aboriginal people and racial minorities. These requirements, contained in the Employment Equity Act, will be phased in over three years. Large private sector employers (those with 500 or more employees in Ontario) must develop employment equity plans by 1 March 1996. The deadline for companies with between 100 and 499 employees is 1 September 1996, while employers with between 50 and 99 employers have until 1 September 1997. Private sector employers with less than 50 employees, and broader public sector employers with less than 10 employees, are not covered by the Act.

<p>In developing their employment equity plans, employers will be expected to:

<ul>
<li>communicate with employees on the process and results
<li>survey their workforce to determine their representation of the designated groups 
<li>review their workplace policies and practices to determine if any barriers to employment equity exist and, if so, develop plans to remove them.
</ul>

<p>Where there is union representation, the employer and bargaining agents must undertake employment equity as a joint responsibility. For private sector employers with 100 or more employees, the plan must include numerical goals and timetables for making the workforce more representative of the community. Employment equity plans must be reviewed every three years. The CEO (or equivalent) must certify compliance to the Government both initially and then triennially.

Tax hits group life insurance

<p>Employers should re-examine the manner in which life insurance is provided in the light of proposed changes to the tax treatment of life insurance, under draft legislation issued by the Federal Government. One proposal concerns the removal of the Can$25,000 exemption in the taxable benefit calculation for life insurance. With effect from 1 July 1994, all employer-paid premiums for any group life insurance will be a taxable benefit not only to employees, but to former employees as well. The legislation requires the use of one premium rate per policy for the last half of 1994. Starting from 1 January 1995, the legislation requires that multiple premium rates, when used under a single policy, must be used in the computation of the taxable benefit. Employer-paid sales tax on group term life insurance is also subject to the taxable benefit calculation. 

<p>The purchase of paid-up life insurance has, in practice, been a deductible expense for employers in the year of purchase and typically has not been included as a taxable benefit for individuals whose insurance exceeded Can$25,000. The draft legislation exempts paid-up life insurance purchased before February 1994. Such insurance purchased after that date but before 1997 will be taxable to the employee or retiree over three years at the rate of one-third of the total tax-able benefit per year. Correspondingly, the employer purchasing the paid-up life insurance may claim a deduction over three years at the rate of one-third of the cost per year. After 1996, paid-up life purchases will represent a fully taxable benefit in the year of purchase to the employee or retiree and will be deductible to the employer.

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION</a></h2>
<h4>Works Councils proposal moves forward</h4>

<p>Multinational companies operating in the EU should consider the impact of the European Commission's proposals for establishing works councils, scheduled to be adopted before the end of 1994, and to be implemented by the end of 1996.

<p>The European Commission has forwarded its proposal to the European Council for consideration by all Member States (except the UK). The proposal affects 'Community-scale undertakings or groups of undertakings' with at least 1,000 staff within Member States (excluding the UK) and with at least 100 staff based in each of two (or more) Member States (excluding the UK). The proposal's objective is to 'improve the right to information and consultation of employees'. Its main provisions are:

<ul>
<li>companies covered by the proposal must create either:
— a European committee, or
— an employee information and consultation procedure.
   Both of these are to be created following agreement between central management and a special negotiating body (SNB).
<li>companies covered by the proposal do not, however, have to take either option, unless:
— central management wishes to do so, or
— 100 employees (or their representatives) in at least two undertakings in at least two Member States (excluding the UK) ask to do so in writing.
<li>European committees will effectively be imposed on companies covered by the proposal, in circumstances including:
— where central management and the SNB wish it.
— the refusal by central management to begin discussions within six months of receiving their employees' written request (see above).
— the failure by central management and the SNB to reach agreement within two years of receiving the written request.
<li>Member States must ensure that European committees or information and consultation procedures are in place within two years of the adoption of the proposal by the Council of Ministers.
</ul>

<p>Multinational companies operating in the EU are likely to be included within the scope of the final Directive, irrespective of the location of their headquarters.

<h4><a name="eu2">Pension Fund Directive withdrawn</a></h4>

<p>Employers and trustees should still undertake regular reviews of their investment strategy for supplementary retirement benefit plans, despite the withdrawal by the European Commission of the draft Pension Fund Directive — that would have allowed new freedoms for cross-border investment (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9404.html#eu">April 1994</a>). In place of the Directive, the European Commission is proposing to introduce a recommendation that would be on the same lines as the Directive but would not be legally binding on Member States. It would, however, be open to the European Court of Justice to enforce the recommendation under any relevant court cases referred to it in future.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>
<h4>Pensions spending rises again</h4>

<p>The new Berlusconi Government is studying ways to curb the mounting public deficit caused largely by over-generous State pensions and healthcare programmes. The Governor of the Bank of Italy has joined the Finance Minister in putting pressure on the Government to address the issue urgently. The 1995 Budget is expected to include corrective measures, including further cutbacks to the national health system and State pensions.

<p>To compound the existing problems, a constitutional court decision has added approximately ItL30,000 bn to this year's spending on pensions. The decision, which affects 600,000 people, essentially involves the review of pensions being paid since 1983. The court decision is a further example of how, over recent years, the courts' favourable interpretations have helped make Italy's State-run pension system the most costly and deficit-ridden in Europe.

<h4><a name="it2">Introduction of pension legislation delayed</a></h4>

<p>A Government committee is seeking to renew its efforts to finalise and possibly revamp Law 124. This is Italy's first private pension scheme law and was introduced in April 1993 to provide a legislative framework for such schemes. Law 124 is now officially waiting for 'implementation decrees'. However, these decrees will probably include amendments to the law itself, particularly in the area of tax incentives for private pensions.  In the meantime, the 15% withholding tax on all employer and employee contributions to private pension schemes, which was due to come into effect on 1 July 1994, has been postponed to 1 January 1995, owing to the delayed implementation decrees.

<h4><a name="it3">Pension schemes for commercial dirigenti reviewed</a></h4>

<p>Commercial sector companies should examine benefit levels for their dirigenti, following the substantial changes/cut-backs, effective from 1 January 1994, in the Fondo Mario Negri (FPDAC) and PREVIR, the statutory supplementary pension schemes for commercial dirigenti. The liabilities of private schemes that integrate with these statutory schemes will be affected accordingly.

<h2><a name="jp">JAPAN</a></h2>
<h4>1994 pay increases in major firms</h4>

<p>The 1994 Shunto — the spring collective bargaining — resulted in 3.1% base pay increases among Nikkeiren members: the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations. But because many firms suppressed or decreased the semi-annual bonus, Towers Perrin estimates based on 279 firms show the real increase in annualised total pay among major firms as closer to 1.6%. 

<p>With inflation running at 1.2% per year, and allowing for income taxes, real wages in Japanese firms are probably static. This is in contrast with major foreign affiliates, where Towers Perrin data on approximately 100 firms shows that base pay increases and annualised total pay increases were around 3.9%. In foreign firms, semi-annual bonus levels are either contractually fixed or have been maintained!

<h4><a name="jp2">Japan Inc pay freeze</a></h4>

<p>Major firms such as Toyota, Nippon Life and Sumitomo Bank  appear to have responded to Nikkeiren's appeal to maintain Japan's international competitiveness by restraining labour costs. Given the difficulty of staff reductions, they have chosen to keep costs in check by reducing their graduate intake for 1994 and freezing their starting salaries at 1993 levels. The unions see this as a prelude to calls for a pay freeze or pay cut in the spring 1995 round of collective bargaining.

<h2><a name="nl">NETHERLANDS</a></h2>
<h4>Pension Act revised</h4>

<p>From 1 July 1994, employers will need to introduce changes to their retirement benefit plans, to comply with the provisions of the Pension and Savings Fund Act, approved by Parliament on 28 June 1994. From 1 July 1994, employees will have the legal right to transfer their pension entitlements when changing jobs. Other amendments include:

<ul>
<li>the equal treatment of full- and part-time workers in the accumulation of pension rights
<li>the right to choose between a survivor's pension and a higher or earlier effective old age pension
<li>the prohibition against payment of lump sums to pension plan members who are emigrating, and
<li>the establishment of legal disclosure requirements.
</ul>

<h4><a name="nl2">Pension rights on divorce strengthened</a></h4>

<p>With effect from 1 May 1995, the divorced partner of a pension fund member will be able to claim 50% of the member's old age pension, accrued during their marriage. With the pension fund's agreement, this claim can be converted into a pension right for the partner during his or her lifetime. Until 1 May 1995, divorced partners are only entitled to 50% of the cash value of all pension rights accrued before the date of divorce.

<h4><a name="nl3">Pensionable earnings increased</a></h4>

<p>Employers should consider the effect on occupational schemes of the new legislation that replaces certain compensation payments by an increase in gross salary. Compensation payments that correspond to the premiums for general disability insurance and general medical insurance (Overhevelingstoeslag) will now be included in employees' gross salaries, thus increasing pensionable salaries. Until 1 January 1990, employers paid these premiums on their employees' behalf. Since that date, employees have had to pay the premiums themselves and the compensation payment was introduced to compensate for this shift in premium. Gross salaries will increase by 10.5% up to a maximum of DFL8,306, effective from 1 January 1996.

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>New employment legislation introduced</h4>

<p>New legislation covering childcare allowances, partial pensions and equal pay came into effect on 1 July 1994.

<p><b>Childcare allowances:</b> A childcare allowance of up to SEK2,000 per month has been introduced for children aged between one and three years. The allowance will be reduced for children who attend municipal daycare centres or nurseries.

<p>This new allowance is in addition to the ordinary childcare allowance which provides up to 90% of earnings (up to the indexed earnings ceiling of SEK 264,000 for 1994) during 360 days of the year.

<p><b>Partial pensions:</b> The age at which partial pensions may be drawn is now 61, instead of 60 as previously. The maximum amount of partial pension that can be paid is 55% of loss of earnings so that if, for example, an individual opted for 50% partial retirement, continuing to work the other 50%, the partial pension payable would be 55% x 50%, ie 28%. 

<p><b>Equal pay:</b> The Equal Employment Authority (Jämnställdhetsombudsman) now has greater powers to ensure that women's pay is the same as men's for jobs of equal worth. All jobs are to be evaluated using factors such as competence, skills, effort, responsibility and working conditions. Cases may be referred to the authority either by the individuals concerned or by the unions. In addition, employers with more than ten employees have to establish whether pay differences between men and women exist. If they do, they must be eliminated. However, the law does not cover other categories of employees such as those belonging to ethnic or immigrant groups.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>UK contravenes EU employment law</h4>

<p>Two rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 8 June 1994 mean that the Government will have to amend existing legislation to ensure that all companies, including non-unionised ones, consult with their employees when planning either:

<ul>
<li>to make more than ten employees redundant, or
<li>to transfer employees between businesses.
</ul>

<p>The rulings stated that the UK Government had contravened EU laws that protect workers' rights when it contracted-out public services. According to the ECJ, the Government had not implemented key aspects of two EU Directives — Acquired Rights (1977) and Collective Redundancies (1975). The 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment Regulations) (TUPE) that translated these Directives into English law had limited the consultation requirement to those employers with recognised trade unions.

<p>The ECJ also confirmed that the UK Government had excluded public sector employees from the job security and wage protection given to other workers by TUPE. This has already been corrected by the Government's extension of TUPE to the public sector last summer. However, the rulings will enable public sector workers who lost their jobs as a result of contracting-out to pursue compensation claims against the Government.

<h4><a name="uk2">Employers face retirement plan rethink</a></h4>

<p>The defined contribution approach is likely to prove the favoured option of those UK employers that are currently reviewing the appropriateness of their existing final pay pension arrangements. This is the implication of proposals announced on 23 June 1994 in a White Paper published by the Government.

<p>The proposals, which are expected to become effective in April 1997, mean that all company tax-approved pension plans will need to:

<ul>
<li>index pensions in line with price inflation, up to 5% per year, and
<li>give employees the right to select at least one-third of the trustees.
</ul>

<p>Final pay plans will also have to satisfy a minimum solvency requirement. This is the first time that a funding standard has been mandated in the UK. In addition to the proposals concerning indexation, trustees and solvency, the White Paper also proposed the establishment of a compensation scheme, tighter regulation of company pension plans and changes to arrangements for contracting-out of the State pension scheme.

<p>Employers that currently operate final pay plans that do not provide the required level of post-retirement indexation could face cost increases of up to 30%. This, combined with the new solvency requirements, is likely to lead to employers preferring the defined contribution approach.

<p><b>Employer actions:</b> Employers are free to change benefit levels in respect of future service, subject to the provisions of the plan's legal documents. Key actions for employers are:

<ul>
<li>review whether the current form of providing benefits in the UK remains appropriate. This includes having a full understanding of the current balance of powers between employer and trustees and the cost implications of the new proposals.
<li>understand the implications of the new solvency standard on current and future contribution requirements, asset management policy and costs.
<li>consider whether existing plans should be closed to new hires and whether alternative arrangements should be implemented that better meet the company's objectives for benefits provision.
</ul>

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>Employers move to manage disability benefits</h4>

<p>A  new Towers Perrin survey of 120 medium and large US and Canadian employers confirms that disability-related expenses make up a significant — and rapidly growing — cost of doing business for many companies. The survey found that employer concerns about rising cost levels and the impact of disability on workforce productivity are prompting a growing number of companies to improve their disability management practices.

<p>Industry and Government studies suggest that total disability-related costs now represent between 6% and 12% of payroll for the average US company. More than half of the companies participating in the recent Towers Perrin survey reported rising cost levels from 1991 to 1992, with an average annual increase of 10%. Notably, a quarter of these respondents reported one-year disability benefit cost increases of 20% or more.

<p>To gain more control over disability benefit costs, more than half of the companies surveyed have implemented or are planning to implement disability management programmes or changes in disability benefit plan design. Just under half are implementing comprehensive strategies addressing both occupational and non-occupational disability management. Yet, despite these recent efforts to improve disability cost management, the survey responses show that most companies feel they still have a long way to go to bring their disability benefit costs under control.

<h4><a name="us2">Healthcare cost growth slows in 1994</a></h4>

<p>Average employee health plan cost increases slowed dramatically this year — to the lowest level in the five years that Towers Perrin has been tracking annual movements in employer healthcare costs. Indeed, average medical plan cost increases reported by the 202 Fortune 1000 companies participating in our latest annual healthcare cost survey declined to just 6% for active employees — from 12% last year.

<p>A host of factors, including employers' continuing move to managed care, intensifying competition in the healthcare industry and the prospect of healthcare reform, is contributing to the moderating cost trend. Cyclical factors also play a role. At the same time, however, the survey shows that retiree medical costs continue to rise faster than inflation for the average employer. And a significant minority of respondents continues to experience double-digit cost increases for employee and retiree coverage.
