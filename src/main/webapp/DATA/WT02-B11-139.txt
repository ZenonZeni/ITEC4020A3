   Electronic money in a race with Emu<br>
<p>
      With e-money, users would find it easy and cheap to hold<br>
      funds in several currencies<br>
<p>
   By Giles Keating, head of global economics at CS First<br>
   Boston in London<br>
<p>
<p>
   Economic and monetary union or electronic money? Recent<br>
   suggestions that the start of Emu might be delayed beyond<br>
   1999 raise the intriguing possibility that a viable<br>
   international electronic money will be available before the<br>
   European single currency. Indeed, the former could make the<br>
   latter redundant.<br>
<p>
   The new generation of electronic money, now being tested,<br>
   offers many features that address the problems faced by<br>
   cross-border travellers in Europe. Users would carry a<br>
   plastic card that would let them download funds from their<br>
   bank account using a mobile phone or cashpoint, or at a<br>
   post office. The card could then be used to make purchases<br>
   up to the value of the sum downloaded.<br>
<p>
   Because the cost of foreign exchange transactions under<br>
   such a system would be so low, users would find it easy and<br>
   cheap to hold funds in several currencies.<br>
<p>
   Credit cards already offer a form of multi-currency<br>
   payment. But they are costly, with unfavourable exchange<br>
   rates and high charges to retailers, and they are<br>
   uneconomic for small transactions such as bus fares. Nor<br>
   can they be used for person-to-person transfers, as with<br>
   electronic money, or e-money.<br>
<p>
   Credit cards are also available only to people with a<br>
   record of stable financial affairs, whereas electronic<br>
   money is pre-paid - you cannot spend what you do not have<br>
   and available to all.<br>
<p>
   From the perspective of the single currency, there is a<br>
   greater difference between credit cards and electronic<br>
   money. With a credit card, the retailer receives local<br>
   currency, the card holder pays the bill in his or her home<br>
   currency, and the card provider makes the currency<br>
   exchange. With electronic money, cardholders and retailers<br>
   would choose which currency to hold and to conduct the<br>
   transaction in.<br>
<p>
   With e-money, it would become natural to hold an<br>
   appreciating foreign currency for transactions at home and<br>
   abroad. In short, e-money offers true "currency<br>
   competition".<br>
<p>
   Unleashed on Europe's present babel of currencies, the<br>
   effect could be dramatic. Smaller currencies could almost<br>
   disappear -- especially if there is any hint of systematic<br>
   depreciation. Even larger currencies would face a<br>
   substantial decline in usage if they were weak.<br>
<p>
   With private-sector transactions voluntarily taking place<br>
   in strong foreign currencies, weaker currencies would<br>
   progressively be reduced to being used for a residual lump<br>
   of "legal tender" transactions, such as tax payments.<br>
   Long-term credibility as a strong currency would become<br>
   even more important than at present. This is because the<br>
   use of interest rates to prevent depreciation would be<br>
   blunted by the new mobility of large amounts of money, in<br>
   non-interest bearing accounts, kept for making electronic<br>
   transactions.<br>
<p>
   Depending on your perspective, this would be either<br>
   disaster or nirvana. Disaster, because governments and<br>
   central banks in countries with weak currencies would lose<br>
   the seignorage that currency issue brings, and the<br>
   sovereignty it is supposed to provide (but may not).<br>
   Disaster, because it would destroy two central aims of Emu:<br>
   the sharing of power between monetary authorities, and the<br>
   attempted imposition of currency soundness by institutional<br>
   fiat. Nirvana, because it would provide people with a<br>
   powerful protection against the random and hidden taxation<br>
   imposed on them when governments inflate, and because it<br>
   would create monetary soundness via market forces.<br>
<p>
   Will it happen? Governments may try to slow it by<br>
   discouraging retailers from accepting electronic payments<br>
   in foreign currencies. But it would be hard to prevent.<br>
<p>
   With e-money the costs both of currency exchange and of<br>
   obtaining "cash" from the bank would be low, and access<br>
   immediate. So users would not need to keep on their card<br>
   the normal small balance to tide them over in the event of<br>
   something unexpected.<br>
<p>
   Although the promoters of e-money emphasise that their<br>
   medium would be a vehicle for the single currency rather<br>
   than a rival, the race is on. If the present timetable for<br>
   the single currency -- of 1999 plus three and a half years'<br>
   transition -- is adhered to, it may materialise before<br>
   e-money becomes established. However, if there is a<br>
   significant delay, e-money may make the whole Emu project<br>
   an obscure anachronism.<br>
<p>
   Yet if the single currency did win the race, any small or<br>
   medium-sized economy that stayed outside it would need to<br>
   beware. Its currency would need to be seen as strong,<br>
   otherwise it would find almost all its transactions taking<br>
   place in electronic single currency. It would de facto have<br>
   joined Emu without having a seat on the board of the new<br>
   European central bank.<br>
