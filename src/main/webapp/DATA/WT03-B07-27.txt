PERSONAL LIABILITY
FOR ADA VIOLATION
REJECTED BY VA COURT

     An individual supervisor cannot be held personally liable
for personnel decisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), a federal judge in Alexandria, VA, ruled on Dec. 17,
granting summary judgment in favor of a supervisor accused of
discriminatory remarks and behavior.  Stephens v. Kay Management
Co. Inc. et al., No. 95cv470-A (ED VA).

     The judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that the
supervisor qualified as an "employer" under the ADA because of
the supervisor's role as an agent of the employer who exercised
significant control over hiring, firing or conditions of
employment.  He said that the "agent" wording of the statute
merely incorporated the principles of respondeat superior, not
exposure to personal liability in discrimination cases.

     Plaintiff Marian Stephens worked in management positions for
Kay Management Co., a real estate management firm, from 1983
until 1993.  A 1992 stroke affected her ability to walk and climb
stairs but did not prevent her from those activities, which were
part of her job as a resident manager of an apartment complex in
Fairfax, VA.

     According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia complaint, the property manager, Stephens'
supervisor, made comments about Stephens' "handicap" and refused
to allow Stephens to accompany her and a male employee on walking
tours of the property.  Stephens was terminated despite the
absence of prior performance complaints and without the warning
or counseling required by Kay Management's employment policies.
A person 20 years younger than Stephens was then hired to replace
her.

     The complaint named the company and property manager, Susan
Pool, as defendants.

     Judge Robert E. Payne granted the property manager's motion
for summary judgment by dismissing the complaint against her.

     There is no individual liability on a supervisor for
employment-related decisions of a plainly delegable nature, he
said, unless the supervisor also independently meets the ADA
definition of "employer."  He cited case law in which courts
reached a similar conclusion under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act and Title VII.

     In addition, Congress could have directly imposed new and
expansive liability for individuals in the statutory definition
of "employer," he said, rejecting the argument that Congress did
so by implication through ADA provisions regarding recoverable
compensatory and punitive damages.

     At the same time, he said, absolving the property manager of
personal liability does not encourage discrimination because of
the employer's respondeat superior liability.

     Candace S. McCall of Fairfax appeared for Stephens.  David
M. Estabrook of Gordon Estabrook & Yenas in McLean represented
the defendants.

11TH CIR. SAYS FAILURE
TO HIRE MAY HAVE VIOLATED
RIGHTS OF GAY WOMAN

     The withdrawal of an offer of employment by a Georgia state
agency to an openly homosexual candidate may have violated her
intimate association rights and her right of expressive
association, a divided 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled
on Dec. 20, vacating a lower court grant of summary judgment to
the defendant in the case.  Shahar v. Bowers, No. 93-9345
(11th Cir.).

     The majority concluded that the district court should apply
strict scrutiny to a review of whether the decision to withdraw
the job offer when the candidate announced her intention to
engage in a religious marriage ceremony with her partner was
"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest."

     Joy Shahar was offered and accepted a job with the
Department of Law of the State of Georgia.  Before she began
work, she announced her intention to engage in a marriage
ceremony with her female companion.  The attorney general of
Georgia learned of her plans and terminated the offer of
employment by letter in July 1991.  He stated that he could not
approve of "this purported marriage," as doing so would
"jeopardize the proper function of this office."

     Shahar filed suit in October 1991 against the AG under
42 U.S.C. Section 1983, alleging violation of her right of
intimate association, of her freedom of religion, and of equal
protection and substantive due process.  She claimed that
engaging in a religious ceremony recognized by the
Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, to which she adheres,
conferred upon her and her partner a religious-based status which
was separate from civil marriage in Georgia, which does not
recognize same-gender marriages.  The U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia entered summary judgment for the AG.

     The appeals court panel, in a majority opinion delivered by
Senior Judge John Godbold, concluded that the district court had
erred in applying a balancing test to determine whether Shahar's
right to intimate association had been violated.  However, the
court affirmed summary judgment for the AG on Shahar's free
expression and equal protection claims.

     Judge Godbold first emphasized that Shahar's intimate
association claim was based in a long-standing commitment to
religious principles; that she and her partner were active in
their synagogue; and that the couple had been counseled by a
rabbi prior to their marriage.  He stated that, while the
marriage between Shahar and her partner did not involve marriage
in a civil, legal sense, it was "inextricably entwined with
Shahar's exercise of her religious beliefs."  Therefore, that
intimate relationship was constitutionally protected, and
deserved strict scrutiny, not a balancing test review, he said.

     Next, the court remanded Shahar's expressive association
claim, on a finding that the district court erred in not
addressing the issue because of its overlap with her free
exercise claim, and the court's conclusion that the expressive
association claim required no greater constitutional protection
than her intimate association claim.  Judge Godbold noted that
the right of expressive association " the right to associate for
the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the
First Amendment, including religious expression " may be limited
by regulations which serve a compelling state interest.

     Senior Judge Lewis Morgan concurred in part, taking issue
with Judge Godbold's opinion that Shahar's association and equal
protection claims require strict scrutiny.  He stated that Shahar
had not presented an equal protection claim based on a
fundamental right of religious freedom.  In addition, the
evidence does not support an equal protection claim because the
job offer was not revoked because of Shahar's sexual orientation
but because the AG believed that she invoked the legal and civil
significance of being married to another female, which is
inconsistent with Georgia law.

     Judge Phyllis Kravitch concurred in part and dissented in
part.  She stated that, although she disagreed with the
majority's holding that strict scrutiny ought to be applied in
this case, applying a balancing test led her to conclude that the
emotional and religious bond between Shahar and her partner is
entitled to constitutional protection.  Although the "unique
status" of the AG's office made this a close case for Judge
Kravitch, Shahar's "constitutional interest in pursuing her
intimate association outweighed any threat to the efficient
operation of the Georgia Department of Law," she stated.

VA COURT SAYS SUPERVISOR
MAY BE PERSONALLY LIABLE
FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT

     A supervisor may be held personally liable for sexual
harassment in a Title VII case, a federal judge in Roanoke, VA,
has decided.  Frye v. Virginia Transformer Corp. et al.,
No. 95-0399-R (WD VA).

     The court concluded that a supervisor can be held liable for
sexual harassment where (1) the supervisor has a significant
degree of control over the employee and (2) the sexual harassment
is conducted by the supervisor for his own benefit and not for
that of his employer.

     Defendant Jeff Clark was one of Sarah Frye's supervisors at
Virginia Transformer Corp.  He allegedly sexually touched Frye
and made suggestive sexual comments; he also reportedly sexually
harassed other female and male employees.  Frye did not complain
personally to the company about Clark until company investigators
approached her after hearing rumors of the incidents.  She told
them she did not want Clark fired and would handle the situation
herself; she declined to provide a written statement and
resigned.

     The company continued its own investigation, reprimanding
Clark and requiring sexual harassment training for all
supervisors.  The decision to reprimand, rather than terminate,
was based on the fact that Clark denied the allegation; there
were no prior complaints against Clark; and Frye had asked that
Clark not be fired.  Frye was notified of the reprimand, but
refused several invitations to return to work at Virginia
Transformer.  Her request for post-traumatic stress workers'
compensation was denied, and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission issued a no-cause determination.

     Frye filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Virginia, alleging sexual harassment by Clark and
Virginia Transformer, assault and battery by Clark, and negligent
retention by Virginia Transformer.

     Chief Judge Jackson L. Kisor refused to dismiss the
Title VII claim against Clark but dismissed the negligent
retention cause of action against the company.

     First, Judge Kisor ruled an individual supervisor may be
liable under Title VII for sexual harassment conducted for the
supervisor's own benefit, not for the benefit of the employer.
In concluding that there are situations where a supervisor should
be held individually liable under Title VII, he differentiated
between an age discrimination suit where the discrimination is
"relatively benign" and a Title VII suit involving "more
egregious sexual harassment."  He also noted that Title VII's
"rationale of solicitude" for small businesses should be
inapplicable is cases such as this.  Therefore, Frye should be
given the opportunity to prove that Clark exercised the requisite
degree of supervisory control to warrant Title VII liability, he
said.

     Next, he let stand the Title VII claim against Virginia
Transformer, despite the company's arguments that (1) it was
unaware of Clark's misconduct; and (2) Clark harassed both male
and female employees, so his conduct was not "based on sex."
However, he dismissed the negligent retention claim, holding
that, although state law recognizes the tort of negligent hiring,
it does not recognize the tort of negligent retention:  "employer
liability in this analysis centers only on the decision to hire;
it goes no further once the employee is actually retained."

     Terry Neill Grimes of King, Fulghum, Snead, Nixon & Grimes
in Roanoke represented Frye.  Defense counsel were Clinton
Stephen Morse and Todd A. Leeson of Woods, Rogers & Hazlegrove in
Roanoke and Agnis Chandra Chakravorty of the Center for
Employment Law in Roanoke.

10TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR
K-MART IN HARASSMENT CASE

     An employee who claimed that K-Mart should be held liable
for her sexual harassment by a co-worker cannot avoid summary
judgment in favor of her employer because she failed to show that
the company knew about, but did nothing to remedy, the alleged
hostile workplace, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has
held.  Ulrich v. K-Mart Corp., No. 94-3267 (10th Cir.).

     The panel affirmed the decision and reasoning of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas, noting that, although
the alleged harasser had the title of "manager," there was no
evidence that he used any supervisory authority to facilitate his
sexual harassment of the employee.

     Terry Ulrich worked in the layaway department at K-Mart.
She worked regularly on inventory checks with Larry Denney, who
held the title of "loss prevention manager."  In August 1991,
Ulrich reported to K-Mart's personnel manager a number of
incidents of sexual harassment by Denney, who allegedly grabbed
her breasts and other areas of her anatomy, and kissed her
against her will.

     K-Mart responded to the report by instructing Denney in
writing to stay away from Ulrich during investigation of the
incidents, all of which took place within one week during July
1991.  Denney was later fired.
               Ulrich filed one charge with the state human rights
commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and
later filed a second charge claiming that K-Mart retaliated
against her for the first charge.  Ulrich said that her
assignment after her return from a leave of absence was a
"demotion."  K-Mart countered that the temporary assignment about
which Ulrich complained was not a demotion, as Ulrich continued
to receive the same rate of pay and benefits as she had prior to
her leave of absence.

     The complaint alleged sexual harassment and constructive
discharge/retaliation under Title VII and the Kansas Acts Against
Discrimination, assault and battery, negligent retention,
invasion of privacy, breach of duty to provide a harassment-free
workplace, and failure to properly hire and train.

     U.S. District Judge Monti Belot entered summary judgment in
favor of K-Mart.  He found that, although Denney's conduct
constituted hostile environment sexual harassment, K-Mart could
not be held liable.

     First, K-Mart was not liable for the harassment because
(1) the "grabbing, hugging and fondling" were not within Denney's
job description; (2) the employee handbook expressly stated that
sexual harassment was prohibited; and (3) the handbook definition
of sexual harassment covered Denney's conduct.

     Second, the court rejected Ulrich's contention that K-Mart
had actual or constructive notice of Denney's harassment of other
employees because he had been involved in three adulterous
affairs with female co-workers.  Judge Belot said that, even if
K-Mart had known about the affairs, the evidence clearly
indicated that the relationships were consensual.  The sexual
advances must be unwelcome to trigger a duty on the employer to
act to prevent them, he stated.  In addition, the company acted
promptly to remedy the situation with Ulrich, observed the judge.

     Third, the company cannot be held liable for the harassment
because Denney did not purport to be acting as K-Mart's agent at
the time of the misconduct.  While Denney held the title of
"manager" with respect to the store's surveillance and security,
he did not hire or fire anyone, did not discipline anyone and did
not control other employees' schedules or their wages.  More
importantly, Ulrich does not claim that Denney used any
supervisory authority to press his sexual harassment of Ulrich,
said the court.

     Turning to Ulrich's constructive discharge/retaliation
claims, Judge Belot said that Ulrich had failed to show that the
temporary assignment she was given after her return from a leave
of absence made her working conditions so intolerable that she
was forced to quit.  The court said it was the fact that Ulrich's
pay and benefits remained the same and not her subjective view of
the "atmosphere or dignity" of her employment which determined
whether Ulrich had been constructively discharged.  "A reasonable
person in Ulrich's position would not view having to perform the
duties of door greeter and checker for limited periods of time as
intolerable," said the judge.

     Finally, Ulrich's negligent retention and failure to
properly hire and train were rejected by the district court.  K-
Mart's personnel director testified that, until Ulrich herself
reported Denney's misconduct in August 1991, the company had no
knowledge of the problem, said Judge Belot.

CALIFORNIA JUDGE CLEARS
LOS ANGELES COUNCILMAN OF
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES

     A California state court judge has rejected the claims of a
former secretary that her boss, a Los Angeles city councilman,
two of his employees and the city itself were responsible for
hostile environment and quid pro quo sexual harassment.  Beyda v.
City of Los Angeles et al., No. BC083850 (CA Super. Ct., Los
Angeles Cty.).

     In his Nov. 27 ruling, the judge stated that the
councilman's condominium, where some of the alleged harassment
took place, did not constitute a "workplace":  there was
insufficient evidence that the visits by the secretary were work-
related, or that the defendant had exerted "some kind of power"
over the plaintiff to get her to come to the apartment.

     According to Marlee Beyda's August 1993 complaint, she was
hired as Councilman Nate Holden's secretary in April 1991.
Shortly thereafter, she was allegedly subjected to sexual
harassment in the form of unwanted touching of her; forced
touching of Holden; forcible removal of her clothing; requests
for unwelcome sexual interaction as a condition of continued
employment; and sexually explicit conversations in her presence.
The harassment took place not only in the "sexually charged"
atmosphere of the office, but also in Holden's condominium, where
Holden tried to convince Beyda that she "owed" him sexual
activity after all he had done for her, she claimed.

     Beyda claimed that two of Holden's employees either joined
in the verbal harassment or cooperated in Holden's misconduct in
an attempt to get her " the only white female and/or Jewish
employee in Holden's office " to quit.  Beyda also said that
African-American males were given preference with respect to work
hours, assignments, trips out of the city and application of
office policies.  The harassment and the preferential treatment
of men constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis of
gender, race, ethnicity and religion, and forced her to quit her
job, she claimed.  She requested $1 million in damages on her
claims of discrimination, wrongful termination, breach of
contract, negligent supervision, assault, battery and invasion of
privacy.

     In her trial brief, Beyda argued not only that she was the
target of sexual harassment, but also that she was subjected to
harassment by having to witness the harassment of other female
co-workers.  Hostile environment can be found when a "supervisor
obtains sexual favors from subordinates other than the
complainant," she contended.  She urged the court to hold the
defendants liable for knowledge of Holden's harassment even
though she did not report each and every incident of misconduct.

     In their post-trial brief, the three individual defendants
argued that Beyda failed to meet her burden of showing that the
harassing conduct "altered her working conditions and created an
abusive working environment."  Beyda's working environment did
not extend to Holden's private residence, as she herself admitted
that she was not asked to work at the apartment and did not work
there, they argued.  In addition, Beyda could not support her
contention that she was, as were deputies, on call 24 hours per
day, and, therefore, that she was "working" at Holden's apartment
whenever she went there after normal office hours.

     Second, there was no evidence that Holden had the authority,
or misused that authority, to coerce Beyda to come to his home,
said the defendants.  However, even if the apartment were
considered an extension of the work environment, there was no
evidence that any sexual harassment occurred there.  For example,
Beyda never complained to anyone in authority about Holden's
treatment of her; she visited the apartment even after she
resigned; and her demeanor and performance at work did not
display any of the depression or other emotional distress of
which she complained, said the defendants.

     Third, Beyda did not establish the elements of a qui pro quo
harassment claim, argued the defendants.  Her attendance of work-
related events was not curtailed in any way, and she did not
demonstrate that Holden conditioned her "putting out" or having
sex of any kind on raises, promotions, pay, demotion, termination
or any other adverse job consequence.

     Beyda was represented by Dan Stormer of Hadsel & Stormer in
Pasadena and by J.L. O'Donnell of O'Donnell & Mandrell in Los
Angeles.  Counsel for the individual defendants were Louis Miller
and Michael O'Connor of Christensen, White, Miller, Fink, Jacobs,
Glaser & Shapiro in Los Angeles.

LEGAL SECRETARY CLAIMS
FORMER LAW FIRM LIABLE
FOR HARASSMENT, DEFAMATION

     A legal secretary has filed suit in California state court
against her former employer, alleging that she was sexually
harassed by one of the firm's partners, and that the rest of the
firm conspired to cover up the misconduct and force her out of
her job when she complained.  Van Sloten v. Chase, Rotchford,
Drukker & Bogust et al., No. BC139859 (CA Super. Ct., Los Angeles
Cty.).

     The complaint also contains claims for sexual battery,
defamation, negligence, breach of oral contract and wrongful
termination.

     Plaintiff Martha Van Sloten began working for the firm of
Chase, Rotchford, Drukker & Bogust in 1977 and, in 1978, was
assigned to work for firm partner Howard Slavin as his personal
secretary.  She says that Slavin made "offensive and off-color
sexual remarks" to her, including several requests for sexual
intercourse and descriptions of his sexual fantasies; touched her
in a sexual manner; and finally raped her in December 1992 and
December 1993.

     The rest of the firm knew about the incidents of sexual
harassment by Slavin, but took no action to remedy the situation,
claims Van Sloten.  This failure to stop the harassment amounted
to an "authorization and ratification" of Slavin's misconduct by
the officers and directors, says the complaint.  In addition, the
firm and Slavin conspired to increase the harassment in an
attempt to damage her health and force her to quit, says Van
Sloten.  Allowing Slavin to occupy "positions of trust and
authority at a time when they knew or should have known about his
improper conduct" amounted to negligence on the part of the firm,
she says.

     The basis of the defamation claim are false statements
allegedly made by the firm concerning Van Sloten's "inadequate"
job performance, again in an attempt to force her out of her job.
The defendants also breached their oral contract with Van Sloten
by failing to ensure that she worked in an environment free of
sexual harassment, says the complaint.  According to the
complaint, Van Sloten was terminated in violation of public
policy because her 16-year career with Chase Rotchford gave her
"the present ability to testify to facts which implicated
defendants Chase Rotchford and Slavin in acts which violated the
provisions of the state bar act...."

     Van Sloten has requested the award of double her lost
earnings as well as unspecified general damages for mental
distress, punitive and exemplary damages, an injunction against
the firm, an order that mandates sensitivity training and
publicly posted statements at the firm to inform employees that
sexual harassment violates state and federal law.

     The complaint was filed by David Smith Bates of Beverly
Hills.

8TH CIRCUIT THROWS OUT
$500,000 PUNITIVE AWARD IN
CREDIT CARD SNOOPING SUIT

     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 19 reversed
a punitive damage award of $500,000 to a former Amoco Oil Co.
employee who claimed that he was fired because of his age, and
that Amoco invaded his privacy by inspecting his credit card
records for days when he had called in sick.  Pulla v. Amoco Oil
Co., Nos. 94-4001 and 95-1047 (8th Cir.).

     The court concluded that, given the "limited offensiveness"
of Amoco's actions and the "unlikelihood of any serious potential
harm" from its conduct, the 250,000-to-1 ratio of punitive
damages to actual damages was "excessive, unreasonable and
violative of due process."

     The dispute began when Thaddeus Pulla, a 15-year Amoco
employee, was told that performance in the company's credit card
department was unsatisfactory.  He was demoted in July 1989, and
replaced by a 45-year-old female.  Pulla, who was 48, filed suit
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), supporting
his claim with several ageist comments by his supervisor.

     Pulla later amended his complaint to allege that Amoco had
retaliated against him for the ADEA filing and had also violated
state tort law by invading his privacy.  The basis of the
invasion of privacy claim was the company's inspection of his
credit card records after one of Pulla's co-workers decided that
she was tired of covering Pulla's shift when he called in sick.
Pulla had missed two months of work in 1991.  The co-worker
discovered that Pulla had used his credit card at a number of
restaurants and bars on the days when he had called in sick, and
reported these findings to their mutual supervisor.

     The co-worker was admonished but not disciplined for
reviewing the credit card records, and Amoco subsequently
retrieved the information and made it a part of Pulla's personnel
records.  Finally, the supervisor referred to Pulla's absence
problem in his next evaluation, and singled him out for the
unique requirement of having to obtain a physician's note before
submitting any claims for sick leave.

     The jury found in favor of Amoco on the age discrimination
claims, but found in favor of Pulla on the invasion of privacy
claim.  The award was $1 for actual damages for past pain and
suffering and $1 actual damages for future pain and suffering.
However, the jury concluded that the company had acted "willfully
and wantonly" in violating Pulla's right to privacy and awarded
him $500,000 in punitive damages.

     The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa
rebuffed Amoco's motion for j.n.o.v., a new trial and remittitur.

     The appeals court panel, in an opinion by the Honorable
Byron White, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, sitting
by designation, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

     First, Justice White found no error in the district court's
conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support the
jury's finding on the invasion of privacy claim.  Therefore, he
said, there was no abuse of discretion in denying in its entirety
Amoco's motion for a new trial.

     Next, there was no error in the district court's conclusion
that Pulla failed to present sufficient evidence to support his
breach of contract claim, i.e., that Amoco's employment policies
constituted an exception to Iowa's employment-at-will doctrine.
The evidence included:  (1) a progressive discipline policy which
managers "should follow"; (2) a merit employment policy that
managers "should follow"; (3) statements by Amoco that it will
"follow the law and maintain equal opportunity in employment";
and (4) statements that the workplace should be "friendly and
cooperative."  These were not sufficiently definite or mandatory
to constitute a binding contract, said the appeals court panel.

     Finally, Justice White addressed the issue of the
constitutionality of the punitive damages award, stating that the
U.S. Supreme Court has twice stated that the appropriate
framework to employ is a "general concern for reasonableness."
This concern "requires that the award be 'rational in light of
its purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its
repetition,'" he stated.

     Based on this framework, the $500,000 punitive damages award
was unreasonable and violated Amoco's substantive due process
rights, said the panel.  The district court erred by
misperceiving the nature of the potential harm, said Justice
White.  Because Pulla did not present any evidence that the
company put any other individual's privacy at risk, the potential
harm from the search of his credit card records can be analyzed
only in terms of the very limited way it affected him.  The
appeals court contrasted Pulla's situation with one where a
manufacturer puts several thousand potentially dangerous products
" such as breast implants " into the marketplace.

     In addition, Amoco's conduct was not as offensive as
perceived by the district court because there was no indication
that the supervisor's conduct in retrieving Pulla's credit card
records reflected a company policy or practice.  There was no
evidence that this was anything more than an "isolated and rare"
incident, said Justice White.

DE COURT ENTERS
PARTIAL DISMISSAL OF
CLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT

     U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson has ruled that a group of
DuPont employees may proceed with some of their Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Americans With
Disabilities Act (ADA), and Employee Retirement and Income
Security Act (ERISA) claims against their former employer, E.I.
DuPont de Nemours & Co.  Adkins et al. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours
& Co. et al., No. 95-315-SLR (D DE); see Employment LR, July 11,
1995.

     Ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA and
pendent state law claims, Judge Robinson allowed the ERISA
wrongful discharge claims to remain, but dismissed those ERISA
claims which relied on allegations of fraud with respect to the
severance plan.  The state law claims were also dismissed.

     Court documents contained the following background
information:  A group of 180 DuPont employees filed a 12-count
purported class action suit against the company, alleging that
DuPont tried to force out older employees by instituting a cross-
training program and by reducing the workforce by almost half to
avoid paying full pension benefits.

     The complaint states that shortly after the company
instituted a High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) program, the
workers were threatened with termination if they did not comply
with its requirement that each employee learn how to perform each
job at the plant.  The employees also claim that older employees
were intimidated into leaving their jobs and accepting a
reduction in pension benefits.

     The employees also allege that the company refused to
accommodate the vision or physical impairments which those older
employees had, and instead intentionally placed them in jobs
which they were not able to perform.  The company violated the
ADA, says the workers, by creating only four ADA "slots," light
duty positions which were filled on the basis of seniority rather
than need.

     At the time that the HPWS program began, an enhanced
severance benefits program was also announced.  In contrast to
the DuPont early retirement plan, which provided for 100% of
pension benefits even though an employee may not have attained
the age or years of service generally needed for full retirement
benefits, the severance plan paid less than 100% of the pension
benefits, said the workers.  By coercing the older employees to
enter the severance program, DuPont was able to substantially
reduce its pension benefits obligations, says the complaint.

     In addition to alleging violations of the ADEA, ADA and
ERISA, the complaint alleged negligent misrepresentation, breach
of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, fraud and promissory
estoppel.

     Judge Robinson first ruled on the employees' ERISA claims,
holding that those portions of the claims charging DuPont with
having made false statements and misrepresentations regarding the
severance plan "relate to" an ERISA plan, and, therefore, are
preempted under 29 U.S.C. Section 1144(a).   However, while the
judge dismissed so much of those claims which allege fraud and
constructive fraud, she refused to dismiss the remainder of the
ERISA claims.

     Next, the court addressed the employees' contention that
DuPont breached its fiduciary duty with respect to its handling
of the severance and pension plans.  Judge Robinson dismissed
this claim because the plaintiffs were seeking only monetary
relief for an alleged breach of duty under ERISA.

     Third, the court allowed the claims of fraud and
constructive fraud to remain, provided that the employees amend
them to meet the requirements of FRCP 9(b).  The defendants
argued, and Judge Robinson agreed, that those claims were not
pleaded with sufficient particularity, and failed to show the
"nature and scope" of efforts to obtain the information needed to
plead with particularity.  The employees contended that details
were not available because "defendants are in a much better
position to know the details of the fraudulent conduct" and they
were not about to provide such information.

     Finally, Judge Robinson rejected the defendants' statute of
limitations argument with respect dismissal of the ERISA wrongful
termination claims.  She said that, although the one-year
Virginia limitations period applies to this claim, the
limitations period could be equitably tolled based on the
allegations of fraud in the complaint.

     The employees are represented by Robert Jacobs and Douglas
Canfield of Jacobs & Crumpler in Wilmington; by J. David Flowers
and James Rion of Ness Motley Loadholt Richardson & Poole in
Greensville, SC; by Gary Kendall and Denise Linsford of Michie
Hamlett Lowry Rasmussen & Tweel in Charlottesville, VA; and by
Kenneth Henley of Michie Hamlett's Bala Cynwyd, PA, office.

     Counsel for the defendants are Dupont corporate attorneys
Richard Paul and Catherine Thompson and Hill Wellford, Particia
Epps and Wood Lay of Hunton & Williams in Richmond.

6TH CIR. SEES NO ERROR
IN DENIAL OF DOCTOR'S
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM

     A unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
has found no basis to overturn a federal jury's verdict that a
Michigan cardiologist was not discriminated against on the basis
of his age or Mexican heritage.  Muzquiz v. W.A. Foote Memorial
Hospital, Nos. 94-1088, 94-1089 and 94-1420 (6th Cir.).

     The panel held that the dismissal of the doctor's antitrust,
breach of contract and other claims was based on a lack of
evidence or compelled by legal precedent.

     Moses Muzquiz is a medical doctor of Hispanic descent who
practiced cardiology in Texas and Mexico for many years prior to
establishing a practice in Michigan in 1985.  He became a member
of the provisional staff of W.A. Foote Memorial Hospital in 1989.
When Foote established a cardiac catheterization laboratory in
1991, Muzquiz applied for invasive cardiology privileges.
Muzquiz was the oldest member of Foote's staff to apply.

     The review of his credentials ran into some difficulty as
Muzquiz had performed cardiac catheterizations only in Mexico.
As a result, Foote's Credentials Committee had to rely on
translated patient charts obtained from a Mexican hospital.  The
requested films of catheterizations and the original charts were
not available.  The Credentials Committee recommended that
Muzquiz be granted provisional cardiac catheterization privileges
based on favorable evaluations of his first 10 cardiac
procedures.

     However, Foote's Medical Executive Committee rejected that
recommendation, opining that Muzquiz's time away from
catheterization procedures required that his first 25 procedures
be proctored.  Foote's Board of Trustees adopted the Medical
Executive Committee's recommendation on Jan. 22, 1992.

     Muzquiz subsequently objected to the 25-procedure
requirement, as well as to Foote's selection of proctors for his
procedures.  Muzquiz viewed the physicians selected by Foote as
direct competitors.  On March 17, 1992, Muzquiz formally rejected
the conditions placed on his provisional catheterization
privileges.  On March 25, 1992, Foote's Board of Trustees
withdrew the provisional grant of privileges to Muzquiz.

     Muzquiz filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan on Sept. 21, 1992, alleging violations of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Elliot-Larsen
Civil Rights Act.  Muzquiz's suit also advanced antitrust and
breach of contract claims that were dismissed by the district
court.  After two days of deliberation, a jury found that Muzquiz
had not been discriminated against on the basis of his age or
national origin, although it said that "[w]e would hope that
Foote Hospital and Muzquiz would go forward speedily to honor his
residence requirement of ten cases."

     Foote's post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees under the
Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) was denied by the
district court on March 24, 1994.

     Muzquiz appealed the district court's judgment.  Foote filed
a cross-appeal, as well as an appeal of the district court's
denial of attorneys' fees.

               The Sixth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed both the
verdict against Muzquiz and the denial of attorneys' fees.

     The panel said that the district court did not err in
refusing to allow Muzquiz to question witnesses in an attempt to
prove that Foote's credentialling process, while facially
neutral, had a disparate impact on protected groups under
Title VII.  The panel said that, at most, that line of
questioning would show bias against Muzquiz's medical training in
Mexico, but not bias against people of Mexican heritage.  The
panel also refused to assign error to the district court's
refusal to allow other testimony on the discrimination claim.
The panel said that this testimony either did not indicate a bias
based on Muzquiz's heritage or was "simply not probative of
discriminatory animus."

     Muzquiz's assertion that the district court erred in
dismissing his antitrust and breach of contract claims was also
rejected by the panel.  The panel followed the teaching in Nurse
Midwifery Assn. v. Hibbert, 918 F.2d 605 (6th Cir. 1990), that
"the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine prevents a finding of
conspiracy between a hospital and its medical staff...."  Absent
a conspiracy, there was no violation of Section 1 of the Sherman
Act, said the panel.  As to the breach of contract claim, the
panel agreed with the district court that judicial review of
staffing decisions by private hospitals is precluded by Sarin v.
Samaritan Health Center, 440 N.W.2d 80 (MI App. 1989).

     The panel also rejected Muzquiz's argument that the district
court placed undue limitations on pretrial discovery, noting that
the district court's "dismissal of [Muzquiz's] claims was based
on legal determinations that could not have been altered by any
further discovery."  In any event, the panel noted that Muzquiz
had never filed a motion to compel discovery.

     Finally, the panel said, "we conclude that Dr. Muzquiz's
claims were not without foundation so as to entitle [Foote] to an
award of attorney fees and costs under HCQIA."  The panel opined
that "Dr. Muzquiz had a legitimate factual basis for alleging
that the extreme delay in his application processing was the
result of a bias...."  Furthermore, the panel said that "[t]he
fact that several of his claims either lacked sufficient evidence
to go forward, or were determined to be precluded by legal
precedent in this circuit or under Michigan law, does not mean
that those claims were completely without foundation."

9TH CIRCUIT FINDS
EMPLOYER EAVESDROPPING
UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE

     An employer who conducts private surveillance on employees
and eavesdrops on the conversations of those it suspects are
involved in union-related activities has violated the Labor
Management Relations Act's (LMRA) prohibition against unfair
labor practices, said the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Dec. 1.  National Labor Relations Board v. Unbelievable, Inc.,
No. 93-70236 (9th Cir.).

     The panel ordered enforcement of the NLRB order on a finding
that the employer had wrongfully ejected union representatives
based on what was overheard and also violated the LMRA when it
unilaterally established new disciplinary rules with respect to
suspected drug users and refused to make pension contributions.

     Employer Unbelievable, Inc. does business as Frontier Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas.  In February 1990, collective bargaining
between Frontier and the several unions which represent the
culinary workers, bartenders and restaurant employees who work
for Frontier broke down.  After the collective bargaining
agreement (CBA) expired, Frontier began to eavesdrop on employee
conversations and to eject union representatives for "harassing"
other employees.  The administrative law judge found that, while
ejection of union representatives is proper under some
circumstances, the several incidents cited by the union were
"unremarkable" and not a proper basis for ejection.

     As to the promulgation of new disciplinary rules, Frontier
argued that five of the new rules did not involve changes which
were "material, substantial or significant."  The ALJ and the
appeals court panel disagreed, citing in particular a new rule
which required employees suspected of being under the influence
of drugs or alcohol to undergo a medical examination or be
terminated immediately.  The old rules said nothing about an
examination, noted the panel, and this change could hardly be
considered "insubstantial."

     As to the pension contributions, the panel noted that,
during the negotiations over a new agreement, the provisions for
pension fund contributions were never at issue.  The court
rejected Frontier's contention that under the LMRA there must be
a written agreement with the employer before contributions to an
employee trust fund can be made. An employer has a duty to
refrain from unilaterally changing the terms of employment
without first bargaining, said the court.

     Here, Frontier was legally obligated to continue its
contributions to the pension fund after the expiration of the
CBA, and was in violation of the law when it did not give the
union prior notice or opportunity to bargain, said the panel.
Frontier also failed to present any evidence that changes in the
pension plan were reasonably comprehended in its proposals before
negotiations reached an impasse.  There had been no waiver by the
union of its right to bargain over the proposed pension plan
change, it added.

     The panel imposed sanctions against Frontier in the form of
attorneys' fees and double costs, as the company's appeal was
"frivolous," concluded the court.

     The NLRB was represented by NLRB attorney Frederick Havard
in Washington, DC.  Counsel for the union was Barry Jellison and
Michael Anderson of Cowell & Bowe in San Francisco.  James Meyers
of Meyers, Schultz & Wolds in San Francisco and Michael Taylor of
Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart in Washington, DC,
represented Unbelievable.

FL CITY ARGUES THAT
TOBACCO-USE HIRING
POLICY IS REASONABLE

     The U.S. Constitution does not forbid governments, when
making employment decisions, from taking into account the real
and substantial additional costs of employing tobacco users, the
City of North Miami argued in a response brief filed Dec. 4 with
the U.S. Supreme Court.  Kurtz v. City of North Miami, No. 95-545
(U.S.); see Employment LR, Nov. 28, 1995.

     The argument was made in a brief in response to a petition
from Arlene Kurtz for a writ of certiorari to a Florida Supreme
Court ruling that a regulation requiring a job applicant not to
have used tobacco for at least one year before applying for work
with the City of North Miami is not an intrusion of privacy
rights.

     The Florida Supreme Court held that Kurtz had no reasonable
expectation of privacy when she applied for a position with the
city and that the city, saying that it enacted the requirement to
reduce costs and bolster productivity, had established a
compelling interest.

     The city said that the only issue before the Florida Supreme
Court was a state law certified question of whether the Florida
constitution barred the city's employment policy.  Because the
only issue presented to the Florida Supreme Court was the state
law issue decided and certified by the state district court, the
Supreme Court should deny Kurtz's petition for certiorari, the
city said.

     Further, the city said, the state Supreme Court did not
"decide," as Kurtz asserted, a question of federal constitutional
law, and no question of due process.  Therefore, the issue is not
one that warrants Supreme Court review.

     Also, Kurtz's portrayal of the factual and procedural
predicates of the case were "profoundly inaccurate," the city
said, adding that it proved through undisputed evidence that the
policy was legitimate and rational, "while Kurtz proved nothing
at all."

     The city's response was submitted by Thomas M. Pflaum of
Micanopy, FL, and by Pedro P. Echarte Jr. of Miami.

CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENT
FOR DEFENSE IN OFFICE
EMF EXPOSURE CASE

     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causal
evidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to the
development of cancer in humans, a California Superior Court
judge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's
(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers who
say they developed cancer due to the location of an SCE
transformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. et
al., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Employment LR,
Sept. 27, 1994.

     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said he
agreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimony
would not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test.  Such
testimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning on
Jan. 8, he said, failed to conclusively say EMF caused
plaintiffs' cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffs
experts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,
M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; that
based on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.

     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinion
that EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expert
opinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are the
only causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMF
issue."

     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in the
utility's summary judgment motion.

     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and Christianne
Nichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily dismissed with
prejudice their causes of action for battery and fraudulent
concealment and their request for punitive damages after SCE
moved for summary judgment on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney Annee
Della Donna, who plans to file a motion for a new trial by early
January, says the ruling does not affect companion cases Younkin
v. Southern California Edison, in which a March settlement
conference is slated, or Muir v. Southern California Edison,
which is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.

     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motion
claim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that it
applies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devices
or techniques" in criminal cases.  They instead said that their
conclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shown
reliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed in
England.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.

     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable
to the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, but
rather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods or
tests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffs
cite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-
Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based on
an examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."

     The utility continues, "[H]owever, the cases cited by
plaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue with
respect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not the
admissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF caused
plaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility of
scientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causes
cancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the fact
that the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs in
opposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do not
indicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any of
the plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinions
solely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studies
regarding the health effects of EMF."

     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged the
qualifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman of
the University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department of
Epidemiology, and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCE
research scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,
"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is not
credible."

     The plaintiffs added, "These 'utility experts' are too
closely identified with the utility view to access fairly and
impartially the nature and extent of any opposing scientific
views....  Before 1992, neither Sahl or Cole conducted any
epidemiological research themselves.  Sahl published a study on
behalf of his employer, SCE, and expectedly reached a negative
result.  Cole's only epidemiological study was conducted in the
past year, even though both have held themselves out to the
public as epidemiologists for years."

     SCE replied, "In contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole
[that there is no causal relationship between human cancer
development and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted by
plaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptance
within the scientific community of the principle that EMF causes
cancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientific
community, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number of
biological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF
'may' effect and compromise the immune system, and that, in his
opinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

               The plaintiffs are represented by Della Donna and Wylie A.
Aitken of the Law Offices of Wylie A. Aitken in Santa Ana, CA.
SCE is represented by Duncan Barr and Joel C. Lamp of O'Connor,
Cohn, Dillon & Barr in San Francisco; Frank C. Rothrock and

CHLORINE PLANT WORKER
FAILS TO SHOW CO-WORKERS
WILLFULLY ENDANGERED HER

     A provision of the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act allows
an employee to bring a tort action against other employees for
injuries caused by willful misconduct, but a plaintiff who
alleged that her co-workers poisoned her by removing certain
safety devices from an area where she was exposed to mercury
fumes was unable to prove the necessary element of willfulness,
the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled.  Namislo v. Akzo Chemical
Co., No. CV-92-1127 (AL Sup. Ct.).

     Mary Namislo was employed in a chlorine manufacturing plant
was that was owned in succession by Stauffer Chemical Co.,
Chesebrough-Ponds and Akzo Chemical Co.  In 1992, she and her
husband, Ricky, sued Akzo on behalf of themselves and their
daughter, Amber, alleging that both she and Amber had suffered
mercury poisoning and that Ricky had suffered loss of consortium.
The suit named Akzo, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. and
several of Mary Namislo's co-workers.

     The complaint alleged that Akzo and the co-workers had
negligently and wantonly caused the mercury poisoning and had
negligently failed to warn that mercury created a dangerous
condition at the plant.  The suit also alleged fraud, outrage and
willful conduct.

     When the trial court dismissed all of the claims against
Akzo and the co-workers, the Namislos appealed to the Supreme
Court, which reversed and remanded on the grounds that the
Workers' Compensation Act does not exclude Akzo's liability to
nonemployees such as Amber.  The court ruled further that the act
does not bar Amber's claims against the co-workers on fraud,
outrage and willfulness nor does it bar the Namislos' claims
against the co-workers for Amber's medical expenses and the loss
of her services.

     On remand, the trial court again granted summary judgment
dismissing claims against Stauffer and Chesebrough-Ponds for
negligence and wantonness, against the co-workers for willful
conduct and outrage, and against all the defendants for
intentional fraud and intentional suppression of material facts.
               On this second appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial
court's judgment on all claims.  Namislo contended that the trial
court erred in dismissing the willful conduct claims because it
had incorrectly held that those claims were barred by the
Workers' Compensation Act's exclusivity provisions.

      Under the provisions of Section 25-5-11(b), the
occupational disease provision, an action against third parties
or co-employees is not a claim for workmen's compensation but is
a tort action for damages that is removed from the exclusive
remedy provisions of the act, the appellate court ruled.  That
section specifies that "if personal injury or death of an
employee results from the willful conduct, ...of any...employee
of the same employer...the employee shall have a cause of action
against the person...."

     The issue here was whether Namislo had offered substantial
evidence of willful conduct, and the Supreme Court found that she
did not.  She contended that the willful conduct was the removal
of safety devices from machines that otherwise would have
protected her from exposure to mercury.

     She alleged that her co-workers failed to maintain exhaust
fans and a scrubber in the "cell house," a structure in the plant
where the chlorine gas is produced, which she was required to
clean.  She also claimed that her co-employees provided the wrong
filters for a respirator that she used while performing the
cleaning.

     The Supreme Court ruled that the scrubber and exhaust fans
were not safety devices within the meaning of the Workers'
Compensation Act because they are part of the system to produce
chlorine gas, not to provide safety to workers.  In addition, the
court said, while co-employees may be held liable for the removal
or omission of a manufacturer's safety device from a machine "
such as the respirator Namislo used " nothing was removed or
omitted from the respirator and, therefore, it does not fall
within the purview of the act.

     The appellate court also affirmed the trial court's judgment
with regard to the remaining claims, finding no evidence "that
the defendants' actions in handling [Namislo's] claim were 'so
outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond
all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious
and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.'"  It quoted
American Road Service Co. v. Inmon, 394, So.2d [361] at 365 (AL
1980), and Nabors v. St. Paul Insurance Co., 489 So.2d 573 (AL
1986).

     Namislo was represented by Christopher E. Peters of Cherry,
Givens, Peters, Lockett & Diaz in Mobile, AL.  Akzo was
represented by Carroll H. Sullivan of Clark, Scott & Sullivan,
also in Mobile.

EMPLOYEE CANNOT BRING
PRODUCT LIABILITY CASE
AGAINST IBM, SAYS ND IL

     Judge Blanche M. Manning of the Northern District of
Illinois recently dismissed a repetitive stress injury suit
against International Business Machines Corp. on the basis that
the plaintiff, a former IBM employee, was statutorily barred from
pursuing a product liability action against her former employer.
McCall v. IBM Corp., No. 95-581 (ND IL).

     In dismissing the suit, Judge Manning found controlling the
decision in Toth v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., 114 Ill.App.3d
905, 449 N.E.2d 1005 (1983).  "That case holds that an employer
in Illinois who is also the manufacturer of a product used in the
course of employment is not liable in damages to his own employee
in a products liability suit," said Judge Manning.

     Judge Manning also cited the Illinois Workers' Compensation
Act.  That statute says, at 820 ILCS 305/5(a):

     No common law or statutory right to recover damages from the
     employer...for injury or death sustained by any employee
     while engaged in the line of his duty as such employee,
     other than the compensation herein provided, is available to
     any employee....

     Judge Manning rejected the plaintiff's assertion that her
case fell within the "dual capacity" exception to the exclusive
remedy provision laid out in Sharp v. Gallagher Tractor Co., 85
Ill.2d 322, 227 N.E.2d 786 (1983), and others.  "That doctrine
does not apply unless the manufacturer is a separate legal entity
from the employer, said the judge.  "There is no evidence that
IBM, as manufacturer, has a separate legal identity from that as
plaintiff's employer," she added.

     Emma McCall brought an action against IBM on Dec. 30, 1994,
in Cook County Circuit Court, alleging that she suffered
repetitive stress injuries from using an IBM keyboard while in
IBM's employ from 1989 until early 1993.  The matter was removed
to federal district court on Jan. 30, 1995.

     IBM moved to dismiss McCall's complaint, citing the
exclusive remedy provision of the Illinois Workers' Compensation
Act.  IBM asserted that under the Act, McCall could not bring a
product liability suit against her employer.

     In defending her action from dismissal, McCall cited, in
addition to IBM's role as her employer, IBM's "entirely separate
and distinct second role as a designer, manufacturer and seller
of computer keyboards."

     "The duties, responsibilities, and obligations of IBM
imposed by the tenets of product liability law generate
obligations upon IBM wholly unrelated and distinct from its role
as an employer," added McCall.
