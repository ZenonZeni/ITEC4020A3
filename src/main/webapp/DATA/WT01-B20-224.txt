<p><font size="2">Neal Schurer<br>

Iowa Senate District 30 Candidate<br>

Drug Policy Forum of Iowa</font><br>

<br>

We are a country without hope. We can see the effects of

hopelessness in our families, our schools, and our communities. I

am a firm believer that we as a people need to return to our

moral and ethical roots.<br>

<br>

We would all like to live in a country where we care about one

another. Not just saying so, but once again doing so. Our current

government has grown to mammoth proportions and has virtually rendered

the neighborhood, the school, and the church ineffective and

without authority.<br>

<br>

It is my belief and hope that our country's government will come

to see the error of its ways and reduce its size in short order.

Government programs are not always the answer to our social problems.<br>

<br>

We, as individuals, hold the key to social healing. When I, as a

Sunday School teacher, see a child who is wandering from the

path, I have a moral and ethical obligation to take that child by

the hand and direct them back to their rightful place in society.

When a teacher sees a student in need of love and guidance,

he/she has a moral and ethical obligation to get involved in that

child's life to make a difference. When the pastor of a church

sees a family without food, he/she has a moral and ethical

obligation to feed them.<br>

<br>

We have spent the past forty years or more abdicating our moral

and ethical obligations to the Federal Government. Those

obligations do not belong on the Federal Government's shoulders, they

belong on the citizen's shoulders, both collectively and

individually.<br>

<br>

I conclude by recommending a 're-teaching' of American minds.

Teaching, once again, from the American classrooms and the

American pulpits, the glory of personal responsibility. The fact

that there are moral and ethical absolutes which dare not be

violated because the consequences are dire. Until our hearts and

minds change, we cannot hire enough policemen to keep the

lawlessness in check. We cannot build enough prisons to house the

criminals in a licentious society.</p>
