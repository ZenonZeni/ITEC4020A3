Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This is in response to your petition to reschedule marijuana 
from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.  
The crux of your petition is that marijuana itself need not have 
an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States if it 
is shown that marijuana is the source of an accepted and useful 
medication.  To that end, you argue that marijuana should be 
rescheduled as a source of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol because 
dronabinol, the synthetic form of the same isomer, is controlled 
in Schedule II.  

     In a final rule published on May 13, 1986, then 
Administrator John C. Lawn placed a very specific substance, 
synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft 
gelatin capsules, in Schedule II.  Administrator Lawn's action 
did not involve the rescheduling of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
itself, nor did it include any form of dronabinol other than the 
synthetic.  Accordingly, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44(c), your 
petition to reschedule marijuana is not accepted.  

     Since I am not accepting your petition on the grounds that 
dronabinol is a wholly synthetic substance, not obtained from 
marijuana, it is unnecessary for me to consider the broader 
question of whether the rescheduling of marijuana would be 
appropriate if accepted medications were indeed obtained from 
that source.  As you are well aware, the issue of whether 
marijuana itself has any accepted medical use is pending before 
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit.  We are confident that the Court will find no merit in 
the petition and that it will affirm my ruling in that case.  

     Very truly yours,  

     Robert C. Bonner  
     Administrator of Drug Enforcement
