<h1><center>Simulation Services Profitable</center></h1>

<p>Today's systems integrator is faced with more competition and a lower profit margin than ever before. Customers are pushing for more services, pre and post sales, lower billable time and the ability to use robots for more and more applications. The ability to stand out in the crowd is getting tougher.
Robot simulation is not a new tool, but with the advances in computer technology it is now becoming a tool everyone can utilize. No longer a toy of the automotive suppliers, PC based systems like Workspace are showing up on notebook computers and desktops. 
On the pre-sales side, the use of simulation to sell a concept and provide proof of implementation can make all of the difference when you are competing against 2D drawings and brochures. Not only does the prospect watch their new cell run, they can do it from their office or boardroom. This not only allows the S.I. to show what they plan to do, but gives the customer an interactive way to evaluate the process.
</p>
<p>In the design and layout phase, S.I.'s can maximize cell layouts with 3D accuracy, import part data and build the most efficient cell. The use of plastic robot models and cardboard mock ups can be replaced with accurate reach checks, collision detection and a myriad of evaluation tools only seen through simulation.
All of this comes as a cost to the customer who is anxious to see and know the cell they are purchasing will work and be implemented with the highest efficiency possible. The level of professional expertise conveyed through simulation is measurable by the amount of repeat business and referrals obtained from the happy customer.
For more details on how you can profit from offering simulation as a sales and profit tool, contact your RWT Account Manager at 941-466-0488.
