One additional central public school office administrator designated by the district's chief school administrator may become a voting member providing he/she is certified as a school administrator and is designated to serve the district in that capacity in the absence of the chief school district administrator.</P>

<P>WASDA, the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators and the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials have united in their legislative efforts to promote the improvement of education for the children of Wisconsin.  In these politically volatile times it is essential that all school administrators work together to take a leadership role in educational reform.</P>
<P><B>*LEGAL COUNSEL AND ASSISTANCE</B></P>
<P>The WASDA maintains a policy whereby assistance will be provided to members in order to assure that due process is followed at the local school district level when members find themselves in conflict with the school board.  The assistance is provided both through a visitation team program established with the WASB and the other administrative associations, as well as through direct financial assistance for legal counsel.</P>
<P><B>*COMMITTEES</B></P>
<P>The WASDA operates under the committee structure and looks to the action, activities and recommendations of the committees when developing policies.  The following committees have been established by the WASDA:</P>

<P><B>*ETHICS</B></P>
<P>The WASDA has established and adopted a Code of Ethics that should be adhered to by all WASDA members.  While space does not permit the inclusion of the entire Code of Ethics in this pamphlet, the general tone can be grasped by printing the first sentence of the WASDA Code:  &quot;The professional school administrator constantly upholds the honor and dignity of the educational profession in all actions and relations with pupils, colleagues, school board members, and the public.&quot;</P>
<P><B>*AASA</B></P>
<P>The WASDA maintains a charter membership in the AASA and also enjoys a close working relationship with the American Association of School Administrators.</P>
