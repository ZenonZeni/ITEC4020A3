<b>Hydrogen Energy Systems Research and Economic Development Opportunity 
Feasibility Studies</b>
<p><p>
The Department of Energy (DOE), under authority of Section 2026 of the 
Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486, and the Matsunaga Hydrogen 
Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-566, 
is requesting applications as a follow-on to a Notice of Interest 
published in the Commerce Business Daily (on April 21, 1995).  DOE is 
seeking private-sector led, cost-shared projects in research, 
development, and technology validation that include the integration of 
hydrogen technologies such as production, storage, transport, and end-use 
applications.  
<p>
The purpose of the solicitation is to assist the private sector in the 
development of integrated hydrogen systems for applications to near- and 
long-term markets.  DOE encourages the submission of development plans 
for integrated systems related to long-term hydrogen energy markets, 
although DOE will consider applications for systems addressing near-term 
hydrogen 'niche' markets.  In any case, all awardees will be required to 
participate in a Phase I effort prior to consideration by DOE for a 
subsequent award to participate in later phases.  The anticipated 
progression of projects awarded under this solicitation will be:  Phase I 
- - Feasibility Studies (the subject of this solicitation); Phase II -- 
Technology Development; Phase III -- Technology Validation; and Phase IV 
--Demonstration/Scale-Up.  The applications should provide detailed 
information regarding Phase I efforts, but
should also include a sufficient description of anticipated efforts in 
follow-on Phases II through IV to provide an overall characterization of 
necessary steps to allow commercialization of the hydrogen 
technology/system at the conclusion of Phase IV.  
<p>
After the conclusion of the Phase I  efforts by all awardees, DOE will 
evaluate the Phase I results and future plans of each awardee.  Based 
upon technical, economic, and programmatic considerations, DOE may select 
awardees to participate in follow-on agreements without further 
competition.  In Phase I, a cost-shared business and technical 
feasibility study will be undertaken which will result in the development 
of information necessary for follow-on applications in Phases II through 
IV.  
<p>
Applications submitted in response to this solicitation for Phase I 
should provide information including, but not limited to:  a description 
of the proposed integrated system, including status of the individual 
component technologies; technology development requirements; anticipated 
market for the technology/system; energy efficiency; environmental 
impacts; economic performance; regulation, safety, and reliability 
issues; and capabilities, experience, and commitment of the proposer.  In 
addition, the proposer will be required to report data using the HScan 
Planning Method.  DOE will only consider awards to entities which are led 
by private-sector firms.  The entity can include business partnerships, 
joint ventures, or other business relationships between such 
organizations as profit or nonprofit corporations, educational 
institutions, etc.  All respondents must propose to cost-share at least 
50% of the total Phase I project cost from non-Federal sources (cost 
share in subsequent phases will be negotiated subject to statutory 
guidelines).  
<p>
Awards under this solicitation will be cooperative agreements, with a 
term of up to 9 months for Phase I.  Depending on the availability of 
Fiscal Year 1997 funding for the DOE Hydrogen Program, it is anticipated 
that total DOE funding available for the Phase I efforts will be 
approximately $1,000,000.  Individual awards under this solicitation for 
Phase I will not exceed $150,000 of DOE funding.  The solicitation will 
be issued in June 1996 and will contain detailed information on funding, 
cost sharing requirements, eligibility, application preparation, the 
HScan Planning Method, DOE proposal evaluation criteria, and the proposal 
selection process for awards. 
<p>Responses to the solicitation will be due 60 days after solicitation 
release.  To obtain a copy of the solicitation once it is issued in June 
1996, submit a written request to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden 
Field Office, 1617 Cole Boulevard, Golden, CO 80401, Attention: Mr. John 
Motz, Contract Specialist.  For convenience, requests for the 
solicitation may be faxed to Mr. Motz at (303) 275-4754.  All responsible 
sources may submit an offer which
will be considered, subject to the limitations above.
<p>

This announcement is substantially the same as the Commerce Business 
Daily and the Federal Register announcements of the week of May 27, 1996.
