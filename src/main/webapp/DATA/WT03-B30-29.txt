AIR FORCE SAID TO EYE ADDED DELAY FOR ATF: Need For More Data And
Easing Of Tensions Cited

by Timothy McCune
Air Force proponents of making the Advance Tactical Fighter (ATF)
program "truly competitive" are advocating further delays in the
program to give the service more information about competing
prototypes, according to a congressional source.

"There are internal rumblings that if you really wanted to do the
program right and make it a true competition, some further
extension might not be a bad idea, from a public policy point of
view," said the congressional source, who asked not to be named.
To pay for an extended demonstration/validation (dem/val) of the
ATF, the Air Force would have to cut its budget in other areas,
the source said.

A former Air Force official familiar with the program said there
is a "high probability" the service will delay the ATF selection
up to another year in order to gather data.

"There will always be things they'll find during the test program
that they'll want to go back and explore, which means test more
and fly more," the former official said.

The proposed delays in the ATF program come on the heels of a
six-month extension in the dem/val phase of the program announced
by the Air Force in October. This part of the program, now
scheduled to end in July, is to evaluate prototypes that have
only minimum capability. Then, the Air Force will choose one
contractor team to enter the full-scale development phase.

Air Force officials are under pressure to produce a new fighter
that is a significant improvement over current planes because the
ATF likely will be in service well into the next century, the
former official said. Diminished tensions in Europe also could
allow the U.S. to take its time with the ATF, he said.

"Is that extra six months or a year going to give us a lot more
confidence, or even help us fix some things up front that should
be redesigned? It would be hard to argue against it," the former
official said. "There is a legitimate reality that a lot of
things can be changed without a great degree of immediate risk."

At press time, the Air Force had not responded to inquiries by
Defense Week on possible extensions of the ATF dem/val phase.

The $64-billion ATF program pits a team of Northrop Corp. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. against a team of Lockheed Corp., General
Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co., each producing two prototypes to
be evaluated by the Air Force and the Navy. The Navy is a junior
partner in the Air Force-led program, but might drop out in order
to divert funds to other programs, according to Navy and
congressional sources.

The Northrop team already has one prototype completed, while the
Lockheed team is still assembling its first ATF entrant,
according to officials of the company.

Even if the two teams deliver approximately equal amounts of test
data to the Air Force during the ATF competition, there would be
little prototype flying time, "and you'd be betting a lot on
whose paper you believe," the congressional source said.

But little would be gained from extending the dem/val phase if
additional money isn't provided, according to the former Air
Force official. After the Air Force extended the program in
October, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas officials wrote to Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice saying they were cutting back company
spending on the program to the minimum required by the contract
because their resources were already stretched too thin.

"It's not only unfair, but also unrealistic to expect the
companies to increase what they're spending on the program," the
former Air Force official said.

Changes to the ATF program also could lead to severe controversy
when the Air Force selects the winning team, the former Air Force
official said.  Selecting Lockheed's plane over Northrop's would
lead to charges that the Air Force broke its own rules by
extending the contest and unfairly favored Lockheed, according to
the former Air Force official.

"[The Northrop team] will be very upset if they don't win the
competition because they felt they were ready to go and were on
schedule. The extension will provide an advantage to the other
team, because eventually they'll catch up," said the former Air
Force official.

PARIS WILL SHY AWAY FROM MULTI-NATION ARMS PROJECTS

by Timothy McCune
PARIS--Stung by the recent failure of two high-profile
transatlantic arms programs, French officials have redrawn plans
for future joint weapons ventures. Officials said France will
shun large, multinational development efforts in favor of
bilateral agreements.

France will seek bilateral agreements, primarily with the U.S.
and Great Britain, and limit other efforts to "three or four
partners," according to Philippe Roger, the second-ranking
Defense Ministry official on western alliance arms cooperation.

Large scale codevelopment failures with the Modular Stand-Off
Weapon (MSOW) and the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile
(ASRAAM) mean that France should "draw lessons for the future"
and avoid similar efforts, Roger said.

"There should be no bitterness about that, but...in any
cooperation where there are more than three or four equal
partners in the development, it's an illusion to think that it
will work," Roger said.

The MSOW program began in 1987 and was to be a family of air-to-
ground weapons using common components. The program included the
U.S., France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and Spain. The U.S.
and Great Britain withdrew in September from the program citing
budget shortfalls and differing national strategies.

ASRAAM, which was to replace the Sidewinder missile, was started
in 1982 with the U.S., France, West Germany and Norway. France
and the U.S. pulled out of the program, and when West Germany
withdrew from ASRAAM in late July, the program was considered to
be defunct.

"We can have a nucleus of three, or at the most four, equal
partners to do the development and other nations to participate
later in the production. Statistically, [large efforts] don't
work, so we have to concentrate on more efficient ways," Roger
said.

The importance of the shift in French plans is heightened by an
easing of tensions in Europe. Shrinking defense budgets in Europe
mean cooperative agreements will become even more important for
officials in allied capitals, Roger said. There will be "a kind
of quality escalation, since disarmament is only concerning
numbers," he said.

"I think the recent upheavals should encourage prudent military
planners [in France] to get even closer to the United States than
we were before," Roger said. He said his government will meet
"early this year" with U.S. acquisition representatives to
discuss joint ventures.

"What we are not satisfied with is that there are no bilateral
codevelopment agreements with the U.S. It is nonsense, because
for many, many years France has had the second biggest [research
and development] military budget in the alliance. It's going to
be even more so in the future," Roger said.

Roger said government officials will be less willing to OK large
development expenditures for programs that will produce fewer
weapons. "For us that means more R and D cooperation and more
buying systems off the shelf, which is the ultimate way to not
spend too much on R and D," Roger said.

Franco-American attempts to sell off-the-shelf weapons to each
other also have had their high-profile failures. The French
navy's desire to buy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters was
thwarted recently when French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement opted to modernize existing aircraft while awaiting
the French Rafale.

The decision came two years after a French-designed candidate for
the U.S. Army's forward area air defense system (FAADS) was
rejected by the Pentagon.

Roger said these decisions showed that buying large foreign-built
systems "flies in the face of established powers of each
country," and a more practical approach to cooperation is to
cross-market subsystems rather than big-ticket items.

The French official said there "has been some mixing of
commercial interests with military interests" by the U.S. to
avoid competition with French companies. "We find it difficult to
understand sometimes why the United States uses technology
restrictions against us and not the Warsaw Pact," he said.

There are significant obstacles to overcome in promoting greater
weapons trade between the U.S. and France, Roger said. Currently,
the U.S. only spends 1 percent of its defense budget abroad, with
France only spending 4 percent outside the country. "We are
slightly better than you are, but there's room for improvement in
both countries.

U.S. `BACK TO THE FUTURE' IN PANAMA

by Tony Capaccio
Although resistance was stiffer than expected, Operation "Just
Cause"--the U.S. invasion of Panama--was a less difficult
military operation than it might have been. Sound planning and
tactics honed by repeated dry runs apparently paid off in at
least two vital areas: communications and urban armor warfare,
according to officials.

The Panama operation made use of knowledge gained from a series
of little known Joint Chiefs of Staff-run surprise exercises
designed to test the communication links between Washington and
commanders in the field.

Analysts have said the U.S. invasion in Panama represents a peak
at the military's future "low-intensity conflict" role in an era
largely devoid of East-West tension. But in an unnoticed irony,
the U.S. carried out the Panamanian intervention with World War
II-era urban warfare techniques.

Concerning communications, the task was made a little easier
because Panama Defense Force (PDF) troops failed to use
electronic jamming devices to disrupt the extensive U.S. UHF, VHF
and satellite communications (SATCOM) network, said a Pentagon
official involved in the planning.

But even if the PDF had the capability to shoot down satellites
"we still could have communicated," the official said. He labeled
SATCOM devices as the workhorse of Just Cause.

And while at least 23 U.S. soldiers and several hundred PDF
soldiers and civilians were killed in fighting, the toll would
have been much higher had not light infantry and their armor
counterparts worked effectively in tandem, said Lt. Col. James
Grazioplene, the commander of the invasion's main armor unit.

The lessons of Panama are destined to be pored over and cited by
Army officials as a model of how the service will fight in future
Third World conflicts.

The unit, the 3rd Battalion, 73rd Armor Regiment, is the nation's
only readily deployable light armor unit. It is equipped with 54
Vietnam-era Sheridan tanks, 12 of which were deployed in Panama.

The unit since 1988 has been refining the arcane art of mobile
urban warfare, said Grazioplene in an interview. But the training
had a unique twist: "We had to go back and dust off field manuals
from the Korean War," for tactical advice on how to fight with
infantry, he said.

The unit also relied in part on a 1949 armor study conducted on
combined infantry-armor tactics used in the 1944 battle of the
Huertgen Forest. The dearth of contemporary doctrine prompted the
unit to begin crafting a new joint light armor/light infantry
doctrine, he said.

By the time U.S. troops descended on Panama, they had a network
of SATCOM channels at their disposal, said the Pentagon official.
The network allowed troops to communicate with their U.S. base
headquarters, the Southern Command in Panama, and if need be, the
National Military Command Center at the Pentagon.

Virtually every unit ranging from the Navy SEALS who landed early
to snatch Gen. Manuel Noriega to the 7th Light Infantry Division
soldiers were equipped with SATCOM units.

The channels were available because Pentagon communications
experts, including the Defense Communications Agency, were given
"sufficient time" to do the technical work necessary to open
them, the official said.

"Just Cause" planners allowed for enough time to open adequate
SATCOM channels because they had uncovered glitches during a
series of so-called "no-notice" communications exercises
conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff since 1984, the official
said.

"What we the operations community did was look at the objective,
which was to take out the PDF in the main, i.e. in Panama City,
and then take out all places we said were nerve centers of the
whole thing," the official said.

Although the PDF had electronic jammers, "we just didn't feel
they had the kind of sophisticated equipment," that could cause
great problems, the official said. "They could have interfered
with us but not for long," because U.S. troops were poised to
destroy the sites if necessary, he said.

"The whole damn thing was pretty orderly," said the official of
the communications procedures implemented for "Just Cause."

Likewise, based at least on early field reports, Army armor and
light infantry appeared to work well together, Grazioplene said.
The tactics employed on the streets of Panama City were standard
doctrine practiced in World War II and Korea, he said.

There was no way last week to independently verify the Army's
account. Attempts to interview soldiers who fought in Ranger
units in Panama were unsuccessful. The soldiers said the Army had
instructed them not to talk to reporters.

The tactics, glimpsed by millions of television viewers, were
designed to use infantry to protect the lightly armored Sheridans
from hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the RPG-18, which the
PDF was known to have. Unlike most tanks, the Sheridan, has very
light armor protection and shields itself through a combination
of speed and infantry tactics.

"We've being doing that for the past year," Grazioplene said of
the tactics. "We've been revising ways to use tanks in tandem
with dismounted instruments (infantry) in small formations."

Another concern was that the Sheridans might have had to battle
PDF armored vehicles such as the V-150 and V-300. For those
encounters, the Sheridans were armed with two Shillelagh antitank
missiles, he said. But the tanks did not engage any enemy
vehicles in fire fights.

Ironically for the 3rd Battalion, the Panama invasion took place
in the middle of a debate within the Army over what vehicle
should replace the Sheridan. Among the candidates the Army is
eyeing for the role is a version of the Marine Corps Light
Armored Vehicle that was also deployed to Panama.

In fact, one major meeting of general officers had been scheduled
to discuss the issue in the Pentagon on Dec. 21 but it meeting
was abruptly canceled.

HILL PANEL IRKED BY TIGHT-LIPPED FOUR-STAR

by David J. Lynch
Members of a key congressional subcommittee last year blistered
the commander of the U.S. Space Command for refusing to respond
to detailed questions about a troubled $1.3 billion modernization
program in the nation's early warning command post, according to
a recently declassified transcript of the hearing.

Gen. John Piotrowski, the head of the Space Command, told
lawmakers they should ask Air Force procurement officials about
the programs, aimed at upgrading Cheyenne Mountain's antiquated
computer and communication gear. The mountain houses the
military's main command post for receiving warning of a nuclear
attack.

Piotrowski's stance annoyed members of the House defense
appropriations subcommittee already upset over reports that the
upgrade would be several years late and millions of dollars over
budget. The clash occured at a Feb. 9, 1989 hearing. The
committee recently released an excised transcript.

At issue were the Communications System Segment Replacement
(CSSR) and the Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC)
modernization. According to the committee, SPADOC is $147 million
over budget and may be up to seven years late once installed.
Officials have been unable to hook up the CSSR, parts of which
have been delivered, because of incompatible wiring. It is
expected to be four years late.

After Piotrowski, who will operate the new systems once
installed, repeatedly parried questions on their status, Rep.
John Murtha (D-Pa.), the subcommittee chairman, exploded:
"General, this is unacceptable...You just say everything is fine.
You won't answer a question unless we absolutely identify what is
wrong because you don't want to take a chance on telling us
something that maybe we should know."

"...I don't know what to say other than acquisition is not a
CINC's responsibility," Piotrowski said. "Unified commanders are
not involved in the acquisition process. The services are."
Earlier, Piotrowski had noted it could be illegal for him, as an
operational commander, to work directly with contractors.

One month later, when top Air Force officials testified before
the panel, the lawmakers' irritation was clear. "We did not get
satisfactory answers from Gen. Pietrowski," Murtha told the Air
Force witnesses.

"We did not get what we considered to be informative answers when
we made an effort to talk to the CINC," added McDade. "...You
cannot expect us to invest taxpayers' dollars in what appears to
be a tangled web. We need to find out what is going on."

After responding to questions, John Welch, the assistant
secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, suggested the
committee hold a separate four- to eight-hour session to discuss
the Cheyenne Mountain programs.

On May 16, Piotrowski reappeared before the committee,
accompanied by Lt. Gen. Donald Kutyna, the comander of the Air
Force Space Command, which oversees development of the new
computer and communication gear.

Kutyna said the Air Force had cracked down on the contractors
involved, GTE Corp. and Ford Aerospace Corp. "I have gone
individually to the contractors and told them they are in
trouble. I have leverage with those contractors becaue we have
many, many other contracts they are competing for," Kutyna said.

Kutyna also said top Ford Aerospace officials had met with him
and Piotrowski to discuss the SPADOC program. Ford also dropped
TRW Inc. as its major subcontractor on the effort, a move the Air
Force applauded. "Ford did not put their best people on this
project. They have gotten rid of TRW--so I think we will have
these things in hand, but there will be problems that pop up,"
Kutyna said.

"I appreciate what has happened since we met with Gen. Piotrowski
last time," Murtha said.

MARINES WORK HILL ON OSPREY'S BEHALF

by Eric Rosenberg
Marine Corps officials and their congressional allies have agreed
upon a strategy to save the V-22 tiltrotor in the face of an
expected recommendation to kill the program by an independent
study group, according to industry and  congressional sources.

Under the plan, Congress would divert fiscal 1991 money earmarked
for CH-53E and H-60 helicopter buys to the V-22, said sources. In
fiscal 1992, when the Osprey will move from development to the
more expensive production phase, the strategy calls for Congress
to divert money from a service life extension program on the CH-
46 helicopter to the V-22.

More than $1 billion would be shifted to the Osprey, which has
considerable support on all four defense panels, particularly the
House and Senate defense appropriations panels. The links between
Marine officials and key lawmakers are close and extensive.
Marine aviation chief Lt. Gen. Charles Pittman frequently
consults by telephone with Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), an ex-Marine
and chairman of the defense appropriations panel, on Osprey
strategy, congressional sources said.

The unusual plan, which circumvents a Pentagon edict to await the
outcome of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) study, has
its roots in other than parochial congressional concerns. The
plan was hatched by lawmakers incensed by what they considered a
double-cross by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last month when he
withdrew unspent V-22 procurement money, said sources.

For the Marines, the V-22 is the number one weapon priority in
which they have already invested billions of dollars. Officials
are reluctant to concede the Osprey's demise, said sources.

When members of the four congressional defense panels and top-
level Pentagon officials sat down last fall to hammer out a
compromise on controversial program terminations in the fiscal
1990 budget, they agreed the think tank study would determine the
Osprey's fate.

IDA's cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA), is
being conducted by the independent Institute for Defense Analysis
in Alexandria, Va., and is due this spring. Congress asked for a
study examining all V-22 alternatives, including a variety of
existing helicopters.

The compromise agreement turned out to be the calm before the
storm. Citing fiscal responsibility, Deputy Defense Secretary
Donald Atwood last month withheld all unobligated fiscal 1989 V-
22 long lead procurement funds--about $260 million--with the
effect of terminating all production contracts between Osprey
producer Bell Helicopter Textron Inc./Boeing Co. and its
subcontractors.

"...[T]he Administration reached a firm decision not to procure
the V-22 Osprey aircraft. Given that decision, it seems fiscally
prudent to terminate the V-22 procurement contracts," according
to an internal Pentagon memo written by Cheney assistant David
Addington. His Nov. 30 memo served as the basis for Atwood's
Dec. 1 decision, said congressional and industry sources.

"Cheney has lost a lot of friends on the Hill," said one staffer,
echoing the sentiments of several others. "It'll be tough to
trust him in the future."

Osprey proponents on Capitol Hill cried foul. Without the long-
lead money and without the subcontractors in place, the V-22's
cost would jump nearly $1 billion, almost certainly ensuring that
the IDA study will side with a helicopter to perform the medium
lift, troop-carrying missions, they claimed.

Pentagon officials tried to ease tensions with congressional
Osprey supporters by asserting the Atwood move didn't foreclose
IDA's options.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), who
supported Cheney's decision to terminate the program, concurred.
"Your decision to hold unobligated FY89 V-22 procurement funds in
abeyance until further legislative action is taken will maintain
congressional options to make a V-22 production decision next
year," Aspin wrote Atwood on Dec. 22.

But an internal Pentagon memo suggests the Pentagon has no
intention of procuring the V-22 even if the IDA study recommends
the Osprey to perform the medium-lift and troop carrying
missions.

In an internal Dec. 15 Pentagon memo from the director of land
warfare to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition John
Betti: "The V-22 COEA requested by Congress will have `emerging
results' by April 90 with a final report out by the end of June.
This effort, however, will not affect the SECDEF's decision since
the affordability and priority issues for a new production start
will probably again prevail."

The IDA study has become somewhat of a joke to V-22 supporters,
who now believe backroom deal-making and bulldozing the
opposition are the only ways to save their pet project. "We're
ready for a fight, and it will mean a fist fight," said one
Pentagon V-22 proponent.

ARMY, AIR FORCE MAP OUT NEW BATTLE PLANS

by Tony Capaccio
The Army and Air Force last month agreed to a new blueprint on
how to fight in so-called Third World low intensity conflicts
(LIC) that makes clear military options should be subordinate to
political operations.

But the document also stresses that should force be employed it
is "vital" it be minimal to reduce casualties and property
losses.

The blueprint, approved Dec. 4 by respective service chiefs of
staff Army Gen. Carl Vuono and Air Force Gen. Larry Welch,
"explains the subtle yet critical differences between LIC and
other conventional operations."

"Military leaders have two distinct yet related sets of
responsibilities in the LIC environment," said the document,
formally called Field Manual 100-20. "First is their traditional
responsibility to their military mission and their troops. But in
addition to simply capturing ground or destroying the enemy, they
must also exercise a constructive influence to achieve larger
political and psychological objectives," it said.

Although many of the manual's arcane principles were played out
by U.S. forces in Panama, one official stressed last week that
few if any troops would have been familiar with its maxims. The
blueprint will not be formally printed until June. Defense Week
obtained a bootleg copy after Army and Air Force officials
refused to release it.

At least one principle critical to using troops in Third World
battles--exercising restraint in the use of force in urban
settings--was repeatedly practiced, said Army sources.

According to the field manual: "Use of the minimum essential
force to minimize the loss of life and destruction to property is
vital. This requires detailed planning, coordination and
control."

How closely that tenet was applied in Panama remains in question.
Hundreds of Panamanian civilians were killed in the U.S. invasion
and some neighborhoods were heavily damaged in the initial
fighting.

But Army officials last week also pointed to what they said were
examples of restraint. Among them were the use of Air Force AC-
130 gunships and Army AH-64 Apaches to attack targets that
traditionally would have required more indiscriminate artillery
fire.

Army officials also highlighted three examples in which U.S.
troops opted for minimal force to take out enemy troops.

"When you're trying to win hearts and minds its the thing you
want to do," said one official.

An official pointed out that an 82nd Airborne Division sniper
killed with a single shot a Pamana Defense Forces (PDF) sniper in
an adjacent building hundreds of yards away. An official pointed
out that instead of the surgical shot, the sniper's lare could
have been riddled with M-60 machine gun fire.

In a second example, troops of the 193rd Infantry Brigade who
assaulted a nearby PDF building refrained from firing at one
Panamanian monument--the large granite mausoleum of former
strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, which was situated directly in the
line of attack on a golf course fairway. In dry runs of the
assault, conducted in the days before the invasion, troops were
drilled to avoid an obstacle representing the mausoleum.

And finally, although it was also situated in a location where
heavy fighting took place, a nativity scene in the courtyard of
Manuel Noriega's Commandancia was unscratched even though the
surrounding area was pockmarked with bullet holes.

The field manual also contained a marked departure from the Cold
War years when virtually every Third World conflict was cast by
U.S. policymakers as Soviet-instigated. "The Soviets are not
responsible for all conflicts in the world," the document said.
But, it reminded readers, "they can and do exploit otherwise
internal conflicts to implement their global strategy." In fact,
according to the document, "the threat to the United States in
LIC is the exploitation of instability by groups opposed to U.S.
goals."

In addition, the field manual also highlighted the role of
special operations forces. Besides planning and conducting
insurgency and counterinsurgency, direct action, reconnaissance
and counterterrorism, commando troops "provide senior decision
makers with options for discriminate engagement, precluding the
need to employ large, conventional combat formations."

MARINE AIR BOSS EYES OSPREY STUDY

Lt. Gen. Charles Pittman is the Marine Corps deputy chief of
staff for aviation. After taking over as the service's top
aviation planner in 1988, Pittman is presiding over what many
consider the most dynamic period in Marine aviation history.

Pittman was responsible for shepherding the controversial V-22
Osprey through the Pentagon and Congress when Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney tried to terminate the multi-billion dollar program
last year. Officials credit Pittman with helping convince
Congress to put the program back into the budget and with
formulating internal Pentagon strategy to reinstate the tilt-
rotor in the five-year plan.

Much of Pittman's time is spent developing long-range plans to
help make the Marines lighter and better equipped. As Marine
aviation chief, he is responsible for ensuring the Marines have
plenty of modern aircraft into the next century--a high wire act
at best given tight budgets and the relative low priority Marine
programs get with the Navy.

Pittman was recently interviewed by Defense Week reporter Eric
Rosenberg.

DEFENSE WEEK: First, can you describe the Marine Corps air wing
of the next century, what it will look like, what sorts of
aircraft and missiles you are looking toward?

PITTMAN:  With peace breaking out all over the world, which we
applaud, assuming that continues, we would see a significantly
different requirement for most of the armed forces. However, for
the Marine Corps which has been involved in expeditionary forces
which can handle a full spectrum of conflict, from low intensity
conflict to general war, we won't see any major changes in our
philosophy or where we want to go. We believe that we need a
force projection capability for the United States and that's what
we try to be.

As a Navy force we can be sea-based, we can be land-based, we go
by air to get where we want to go. We can pre-position equipment
on MPSs [maritime prepositioning ships] that can be moved around
the world. The mission of the Marine Corps we don't see changing
significantly. However, our equipment must be modernized as we
enter the 21st century.

So we would see such things as more VSTOL [vertical short takeoff
and landing] aircraft. We're looking at an advanced short takeoff
and vertical landing aircraft, an ASTOVL we call it, which will
replace all of our fighter and attack aircraft...If we have an
ASTOVL we'll be able to go anywhere. But we do need the
supersonic capability, if we want to have a fighter aircraft.
This will also have the best characteristics for the attack role,
which the AV-8B Harrier now performs. Early in the 21st century,
let's say 2010 or shortly thereafter, we hope to have an ASTOVL
for these missions...This may or not be feasible given the budget
situation of today...We just have to see how the budgets come
out and how much priority that has...

DW:      You testified last spring on Capitol Hill...about the
next-generation aircraft the Marines are interested in. The A-12
came up in the discussion. You said the Marines don't want it and
were not committed to it. It sounded as if the F/A-18 will
perform that attack role in the near-term instead of the A-12.

PITTMAN: Yes, that's what I said, and that's the way we see it at
this point in time. The A-12, of course, has not flown yet,
although it's under development and is going very well. We
believe that the A-12 for our particular mission wasn't quite
suitable. First of all, it is designed to be a stealthy aircraft,
which we appreciate and would like. It's designed to handle long-
range missions. We may not need to go that far, not that we
couldn't be assigned a mission like that. But basically, we buy
our aircraft primarily to support our ground forces. Our ground
forces hopefully will not be deployed that far away from our
aviation element. Certainly, if we have our ASTOVL aircraft we
won't have to worry about that.

So the price to get that kind of range from the A-12 may be more
than you want to pay. We believe that the A-12 will be
considerably more expensive than the F/A-18. Now, the F/A-18 that
I described in that testimony was the two-seat model, the "D"
model. There are several concepts of that, one would be a
straight "D" model which we are procuring at this time which has
night attack, under the weather capability, nowhere near the
capability of the A-12 for long-range penetration or attack.

However, what the F/A-18 does give us is the ability to operate
just as well under the weather and with much more speed and
survivability in a close air support environment...

DW:      Are you interested in the so-called Hornet 2000 concept, an
advanced F/A-18 with extended range? Do you need the extended
range if you're fighting close in?

PITTMAN: We're really interested in that. We would like to have a
little more range on the F/A-18. The Navy is particularly
interested in extending the Hornet's range. One of the
shortcomings of the F/A-18 is that it doesn't have the time-on-
station or the ability to stay up with the rest of the forces.
They've got to be refueled in the air or come back early...So we
support the requirement for additional range because you can
convert range into time-on-station which is important to us in
the close air support or air patrol roles.

DW:      Getting back to the Marine air wing of the future, what other
aircraft do you want in addition to ASTOVL?

PITTMAN: It depends where you lay down in the 21st century. Right
now given the current events, it looks like the Marine Corps
would have a mix of some kinds of helicopters. We're not sure
which. We're looking very carefully at what that might be. One of
them, of course, would be the CH-53E which currently is in
production, and we hope to continue that for the next several
years as we fill out our heavy-lift forces. We may be buying more
than we anticipated to replace the V-22 capability, which now is
out of the picture as far as we're concerned officially.

The alternative that would be in that helicopter mix is something
being reviewed by the secretary of defense and his study group
over at the Institute for Defense Analysis. We are doing our own
analysis now, trying to get ahead of the game because we believe
we have to get started right away if we're going to reduce force
levels out in 1994-1995 timeframe. And if we're going to have an
airframe by then, we must start development immediately and
procurement within a year or two. So we are looking at several
alternatives very hard.

First is the Sikorsky Blackhawk, either the current model or the
stretch model which will allow us to carry more Marines
internally which is what we really need. That's the only
shortcoming we've seen so far in the Blackhawk...We're also
looking at we call the "Son of the CH-46," either a
remanufactured CH-46 or some new aircraft as well, kind of like
the F-14D program...

DW:      What's the timeframe for the Marine helicopter study?

PITTMAN: We need to know where we want to go by early spring, and
we're getting a lot of cost estimates in right now. We're working
in conjunction with the IDA study group to make sure they aren't
studying one thing and we're studying something else and we get
some divergent answer and present the secretary of defense with
another dilemma.

I'm not trying to preempt them either. We've got to make sure our
numbers are in agreement or we know why we disagree.

DW:      The IDA study you're talking about is the tiltrotor
alternatives study Congress mandated this year.

PITTMAN: It's the one that studies the V-22. And of course we're
very interested in that. There are groups within the Marine Corps
that still believe the V-22 provided the least cost alternative
over time. Now, if you look at it per year in the near-term,
obviously it will cost more because you're buying a brand new
aircraft with a lot of capability. On the other hand, if you look
over the life cycle cost of things, it varies. That's what we're
trying to get a handle on for the secretary of defense. It may
turn out that we can't afford that kind of investment up front
even if it saves us money.

DW:      Secretary Cheney recently decided to reprogram unspent
fiscal 1989 long lead V-22 funds. If cost is a major
consideration in the IDA study, and you take away the long lead
procurement money, doesn't that have the effect of pushing costs
up, effectively ruling out the possibility that IDA will conclude
that the V-22 is the cheaper medium-lift alternative?

PITTMAN: Of course, it's a concern. But then you have to
understand the Department of Defense position. Secretary Cheney
has said he's decided not to procure the V-22. It would be poor
business to hold on to the procurement money that would buy the
aircraft he said he wasn't going to buy. He has said he will
continue the R&D program, which he is doing. So I think he's
between a rock and a hard place at this particular point in time.

On the other hand, the Congress was very specific in that they
wanted to look at this again in the future and kind of hold that
money for that purpose. So you could say, yes, it worries me,
certainly. If for some reason the secretary were to have enough
information to convince him to change his mind, then, yes it will
cost more money [to procure Ospreys]. I think the $1.3 billion
figure in the papers is high...

DW:      Cheney took away about $200 million in fiscal 1989
advance procurement money. Can't Bell-Boeing put that toward the
program themselves?

PITTMAN: Well, I think the companies already have a lot at
risk...Putting that $200 million or $100 million for that matter
of the corporations' money into the program with the hopes that
someone will change their mind is a hell of a gamble.

DW:      Since the V-22 flight program has progressed, has there
been interest from other nations to get on board the effort?

PITTMAN: Yes, more from the commercial aspects than from the
combat aspects. They're all watching it. Nobody wants to help us
pay the bill, so they are all waiting until we do the expensive
part...

INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PITTMAN, Continued

DW:      Can you describe some of the goals in the Marine Air/Ground
Task Force Master Plan?

PITTMAN: The master plan is designed to look out to the 21st
century and see what kind of force we want to have. There are
several goals that we have in mind. We must lighten up. That's
not to be confused with the light Army divisions...We're looking
at lighter, more effective weapons, longer range weapons...We want
to lighten up the load of things that we have to bring with us.

In addition to lightening up, we've got to be able to fight under
all conditions, we've go to be able to fight in the night better.
We're talking about night vision sighting, night targeting
equipment. We've got to have laser range finders...We need a
faster helicopter-type force, a tiltrotor force. I believe the
tiltrotor will come if the V-22 is canceled. But we still need
the speed, range, the capability of a tiltrotor force if we're
going to survive against modern weapons...

DW:      So you are indeed looking post-V-22. Tiltrotor still is
in your consciousness.

PITTMAN: It's within the reach of mankind, and if it is we're
going to go for it. Now, maybe not the United States first, maybe
somebody else will lead. Someone will hire these engineers to put
all this together and they'll build if for the Japanese or the
Germans or somebody...It's got to go sooner or later...

PLANS TO ARM BASE WORKERS FLAWED

by Timothy McCune
Air Force plans to arm personnel at military bases in response to
terrorist attacks or other emergencies are inadequate despite a
four-year long effort to correct security problems, according to
an internal audit.

The Air Force Audit Agency report, completed in July, evaluated
the U.S. Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, which includes a
blueprint for base protection during emergencies. The report was
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

The report found the service hadn't established policies or
procedures to arm base police personnel who normally don't carry
guns. The service hadn't identified base personnel who could be
armed if there were an emergency, the report said. The review
included installations in Germany, Spain, the Philippines, Korea
and the U.S.

"...[T]he Air Force had not established a standard overall policy
for training, equipping, and arming non-security police personnel
who are deployable or assigned to installations in potentially
hostile areas," the report said.

"As a result, commanders may not have adequate numbers of
weapons-qualified personnel or weapons to protect and defend
their installations," the report said.

In addition, the contingency plans for the Air Force bases didn't
include how critical areas, such as communications centers, would
be protected by base personnel, the report said. The problem was
exacerbated because authority for arming base personnel is "fragmented
throughout several regulations with no single authoritative
source to guide commanders in developing...programs," the report
said.

These problems exist despite an announcement in August 1985 that
the service's plans and operations office would develop the
necessary plans, the report said. A proposed policy was issued in
1988, but has not been approved, the report said.

The report warned that putting the proposed plan into effect
might take several years because of funding shortages.

NAVY SHRPLY REJECTS DINGELL'S BAIL-OUT CHARGE

by Eric Rosenberg
The Navy late last month sharply rejected congressional charges
the service paid up to a $90 million bail out to faltering
shipbuilder Bath Iron Works Corp. to ensure the first DDG-51
Arleigh Burke class destroyer would be built.

"To characterize the settlement of a justifiable contract change
as a `bailout' is at best misleading," Navy Secretary Lawrence
Garrett said in a Dec. 22 letter to Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.), the chairman of the House Armed Services seapower
subcommittee. Bennett released the letter four days later.

The charges were leveled against the Navy in early December by
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee. Dingell said the first DDG-
51-class ship under construction at Bath was at least 18 months
behind schedule because of significant changes to the design the
Navy requested.

Due to the cost-sharing arrangement between Bath and the service,
which required the company to pay for much of the development,
Bath was in serious financial trouble and threatened to shut down
the yard, Dingell said. As a result, the Navy paid the yard
between $75 million and $90 million to continue work. Dingell
labeled the additional government money a "bailout."

"We do not know the basis of the $75 million to $90 million
figures quoted by Congressman Dingell," Garrett wrote.

"The Navy paid the shipyard an additional $34.7 million because
the service requested changes to the design beyond the intent of
the original contract," Garrett wrote. However, "the contract
modification did not turn a $41.4 million loss into a $11.4
million profit," as Dingell alleged, the Navy secretary wrote.

The Navy negotiated further contract adjustments with Bath
because of the added requirement to reduce the radar cross
section of the 8,315 ton, all-steel ship, Garrett wrote. "This
risk sharing is consistent with current Navy policy for reducing
cost risk to contractor for combatant lead ship construction," he
wrote.

The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers will rely on
the complex Aegis anti-air warfare system to track and shoot down
enemy targets. The destroyer program is valued at $33 billion.
Bath is producing the first ship and Litton Industries/Ingalls
Shipbuilding the second.

Garrett's response was met with a rebuke from congressional
critics. "It's a fact-free analysis," said one staffer. "It's all
platitudes about the ship and not much beyond that."

A key point of contention between the Navy and Dingell is whether
the ship's design can be manipulated to elude enemy radar. In a
December letter to Bennett, Dingell said, "According to the radar
experts we have consulted, nothing can be done to reduce this
ship's radar signature enough to make any practical difference in
the range at which it could be detected by an airborne radar."

Said Garrett: "Congressman Dingell's radar experts are
incorrect." Garrett didn't explain how the massive ship can be
constructed to avoid enemy radar. Much of the information
relative to radar cross section is classified, he wrote.

Though the delivery date has been rescheduled twice because of
"unforseen design, engineering and production issues," Bath will
deliver the lead ship within the $1.2 billion cost goal and by
February 1991, Garrett wrote.

"The Navy is confident that these issues are behind us, and that
the DDG-51 will deliver to its present schedule," he wrote.

Meanwhile, Bennett, a longtime DDG-51 proponent, plans hearings
on the issue Jan. 24.

DIA COMPLAINED AFTER KRINGS LET PRESS SEE SOVIET PLANES

By David J. Lynch
A 1988 public display of Soviet aircraft acquired by the Pentagon
for U.S. weapons tests later drew vigorous complaints from
intelligence officials worried the publicity would scare off
potential sources of East Bloc arms.

In September 1988, several Soviet fighters and helicopters along
with some Chinese radar gear were exercised as the Mobile
Integrated Threat Test (MITT) at Kirtland air base in New Mexico.
In a novel approach, the Pentagon obtained the Soviet equipment
through a private company called C3P Inc., which had purchased
them on the open market.

U.S. intelligence agencies acquire similar gear through
clandestine sources. But MITT's organizer, Jack Krings, then
director of operational testing for the Pentagon, said that
equipment is kept under wraps and is unavailable for weapons
tests.

After the 1988 demonstration, Defense Intelligence Agency
officials complained to officials in Krings' office and the
Pentagon public affairs shop that press reports had violated
security rules and spooked potential sources, according to
recently declassified congressional testimony.

"There was controversy...The DIA people went through the
overhead," said a former Pentagon official.

In an April 26, 1989 closed door appearance, Krings was grilled
by the House defense appropriations subcommittee on whether the
press coverage had been OK'd by top Pentagon officials. The
committee recently released an edited transcript of the hearing.
Krings defended the program, saying it had been approved by the
secretary of defense.

Lawmakers cited the DIA objections to an `Aviation Week' article
about the program to acquire on the open market outdated Soviet
fighters and choppers.

According to several internal memos cited by Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-La.), Pentagon officials felt Krings had endangered future
clandestine acquisitions. "The public commentary concerning
Foreign Commercial Purchasing serves to cause disruption and
termination of intelligence sources...The publicity has also
caused claimed diminished availability with corresponding price
increases," the memo said.

One Defense Intelligence Agency official called Carl Pflock, an
aide to Krings, to complain. "I informed Mr. Pflock that it was
one of the most irresponsible articles I had seen...I called
everyone who could remotely have cleared the article. There were
no admissions," said a second memo. And a Pentagon public affairs
official noted receipt of "an absolutely irate call from DIA in
the wake of the Aviation Week piece."

But documents Krings provided for the hearing record, including
an official Pentagon "blue-top" press release, indicated the
event had been coordinated through official channels.

In fact, MITT had been cleared at the highest levels of the
Pentagon, according to Krings. In a telephone interview last
week, he said he had personally discussed the project with then-
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and his deputy William Taft
IV. "There's no question it was all totally approved," Krings
said.

The publicity did prompt a change in the status of the Pentagon's
contracts with C3P. An April 3, 1989 Pentagon inspector general
report found the security classification of the firm's contracts
had been downgraded after the MITT unveiling. "The rationale for
the action was the extensive press coverage authorized by
[Krings]. The government had not disclosed nor exposed the
sources of its purchases, so there was no reason for keep the
contracts classified," the report said. The report also noted
that Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a frequent Krings critic,
wrote the IG expressing concern about the publicity.

Krings said some intelligence officials objected to MITT because
the commercial purchasing program threatened their monopoly on
Soviet equipment. "What we were finding out was you could go out
and buy commercially what they were getting using clandestine
means," Krings said. The commercial buys also were cheaper, he
added.

Some subcommittee members criticized the purchase of outdated
Soviet fighters, including MiG-15s. But Krings said even
antiquated Soviet equipment was valuable to the test program.
First, such gear was relatively cheap compared to the cost of
modifying old U.S. planes to serve as test targets. (A MiG-21
could be bought for $500,000. Modifying an F-4 cost $2 million,
Krings said.)

And some older Soviet systems, particularly communications
systems, have a "unique resistance to sophisticated" U.S. systems
that should be tested before turning up in combat, he added.

Krings also said there is a profit motive behind some of the
opposition to the open market purchases. On some classified test
programs, especially involving simulators, he said there is
little competition and relatively high profits for a few firms.

WHISTLEBLOWER'S SUB CHARGES `WITHOUT BASIS'

by Tony Capaccio
The Pentagon inspector general has concluded allegations from a
former Navy electronics technician who charged serious safety
problems with several SSN 688-class submarines "are without
basis."

The investigation focused on allegations by former Navy
technician Joseph Richards of Lyme, Conn., that sonar and
electronic warfare equipment towed behind one of the Los Angeles-
class subs could foul the ship's propeller.

Richards also contended he was fired from his Navy job at the
Supervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP), Groton, Conn., after
pointing out the potential problems.

Richards fingered twin towed array cables of passive sonar
equipment that are reeled out by a submarine from its stern, much
like a fishing line, and retrieved through an intricate system of
curved stowage tubes.

Richards claimed the internal diameter of the stowage tubes on at
least 11 SSN-688s made by the Electric Boat Division of the
General Dynamics Corp. was too narrow and could jam the array
during retrieval operations, possibly fouling the cable in the
submarine's propeller.

But the investigation, requested by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calif.), failed to substantiate either claim. "We concluded that
Mr. Richards' allegation of serious technical and safety problems
in SSN-688 class submarine towed array handling systems installed
on board submarines built by Electric Boat are without basis,"
the Dec. 15 report said.

A Boxer aide said the report "spoke for itself."

Neither could the inspector general prove Richards' firing could
be linked to his complaints. Richards was fired for
insubordination at about the same time he registered the safety
complaints.

But the IG concluded, "Mr. Richards did not suffer reprisal. We
found no genuine nexus between Mr. Richards' disclosures and his
reprimand and subsequent removal from the federal service."

Richards, who has not found full-time work since his 1988 firing,
last week called the report a "complete whitewash." Although he
had not yet read the entire report by press time, Richards said:
"Based on my knowledge of the IG, it's a white wash. The Navy has
not taken safety seriously. They'll lose a 688 submarine."

Richards said the Navy lieutenant commander in charge of
investigating his safety allegations only met with him once
during the five-month probe. "The lieutenant commander wants to
be a commander," Richards said. "He didn't want to take on the
Navy."

But the IG's conclusion about the alleged safety problems were
based on a review of ten years of incident, or casualty, reports
and seven years worth of submarine maintenance records.

Navy records indicated that although Electric Boat did
manufacture some stowage tubes that had narrower diameters than
required, "all delivered submarines have met the acceptance
criteria in use," the report said.

While noting that over the last decade one SSN-688 submarine
experienced a "serious jamming" of a towed array, the report said
"no serious systemic problem with jammed arrays exists." Three
other minor problems reported "do not constitute a trend," the
report said,

Richards alleged that a deployed array could tangle in a
submarine's propeller if it jammed while being retrieved during a
risky emergency maneuver called a "crashback."

The IG report, however, dismissed that notion: "Were an array or
cable to come into contact with a turning propeller, it would be
easily severed. Submarine propellers are turned with a power
equivalent to several tens of thousands of horsepower. In
comparison with this power, the breaking strength of towed arrays
and cables is negligible."

WAIVER FIX SEEN NEEDED

by Timothy McCune
Air Force officials who sign off on changes to contracts when
weapons systems fail to meet specifications often don't require
companies to compensate the service for the deficiencies,
according to a service investigation.

Service officials often failed to arrange for compensation for
these waivers and deviations even though "equitable price
reduction or other consideration," is required by federal
regulation, according to an Air Force Audit Agency review
completed in April. The report of the investigation was recently
released to Defense Week under the Freedom of Information Act.

The Air Force Systems Command each year approves more than 1,000
major waivers and deviations on major weapons systems, the report
said. The terms refer to variations from contract specifications
that must be approved by government program officers. Waivers are
approvals after items are manufactured, and deviations are
approvals before items are built.

The investigation also found that Air Force procedures did not
ensure contractors completed corrective actions included in
waiver and deviation agreements.

In 54 cases of waivers or deviations included in the review the
agency found that in 17 cases--35 percent of the sample--the Air
Force didn't receive money contractors should have paid because
of substandard performance.

This happened because program offices didn't perform an
assessment of the contracts, or only did a "minimal review" in 12
of the cases included in the investigation, the report said.

In one example, a contracting office withheld $5.6 million after
approving two waivers. The audit agency criticized the program
office for releasing all of the money after the contractor took
corrective action even though the government had spent $3.1
million to deal with the deficiencies.

"...[P]rocedures for reviewing, determining, and obtaining
equitable consideration for major waivers and deviations were not
adequately and consistently applied," the report said.

The Air Force often has to approve waivers and deviations to
weapons systems to avoid disrupting the program schedules.

TROUBLES MAKE CUTS LIKELY FOR SQQ-89I

by Eric Rosenberg
Navy officials are considering significant reductions in a major
antisubmarine warfare program because of its high cost and
technical problems, according to congressional and Pentagon
sources.

One of the Navy's planned front-line defenses against enemy subs,
the SQQ-89I, is in for deep cuts when the Pentagon's top-level
program review panel, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB),
assesses the program in April, said congressional and Pentagon
sources.

The SQQ-89I is a derivative of the SQQ-89 currently in service.
The systems process data from towed sonar arrays, hull-mounted
sonars and aircraft sensors. Two contractor teams--one led by
General Electric Co. and another led by Westinghouse Corp.--are
developing competing SQQ-89I designs. The SQQ-89I is one of the
Navy's most secret programs.

The full-scale development review was set for this past fall, but
DAB members delayed it until Navy planners could put together a
more realistic plan that took into account technology setbacks
and cuts in Navy force structure, according to Pentagon
officials.

The program's survival is threatened by ever-shrinking Navy budgets
as well as technology snags that could lead to a possible three-
to five-year slip in the delivery of the first system to Navy
ships, according to a congressional staffer.

Originally, the Navy wanted to put the SQQ-89I on several types
of Navy warships, including Aegis ships, Perry-class frigates,
and other vessels carrying the basic SQQ-89 system. Now it
appears that the Navy will drop the frigates and others from
their ambitious procurement plans, said sources.

"We want to make sure we have the right program to execute," said
one Pentagon official. "We're looking at several different ways
of doing things...we're in the process of restructuring," the
source said.

GE had no comment by press time. Westinghouse spokesman James
Reinhard said he was not aware of any problems with the program.
In a written response to queries, the Navy said "everything is on
schedule" with the SQQ-89I.

If the effort is scaled back, the entire program may be in
jeopardy, said Pentagon and industry sources. It could be more
cost-effective to upgrade the existing GE manufactured SQQ-89s
than to sink money into the improved version, said sources.

"It's always an option to cancel the program, but it isn't
likely," said one Pentagon official familiar with the program.
The Navy needs the program to help combat the new generation of
quiet Soviet attack submarines, said sources.

ARMY SUFFERS TRIM IN FINAL BUDGET

by Tony Capaccio
Pentagon officials have approved a $75.8 billion budget for the
Army in fiscal year 1991 which represents about a $7 billion cut
from the service's original request, according to Pentagon
sources.

The Pentagon won't formally release the budget for several weeks
and Army spokesmen have repeatedly declined to discuss budget
figures.

About $4 billion was cut from individual programs. Army budget
writers also assumed savings of an additional $2.6 billion from
reforms associated with the Defense Management Review, according
to service sources. The budget as approved December 15th cuts
10,000 civilians and 40,000 active duty soldiers.

Only one major system was killed in the 1991 budget, the NATO
cooperative program to produce a 155mm anti-armor, fire-and-
forget artillery shell called the autonomous precision guided
munition (APGM). The United States led an eight-nation effort to
develop the weapon, which was in the midst of a three-year
feasibility phase.

A similar NATO cooperative program to build a terminally guided
warhead for the Multiple Launch Rocket System escaped the fiscal
1991 budget axe when Pentagon officials reversed a decision to
delete the program's fiscal 1990-1992 money.

The 1991 budget reduced the Army's tank program request by $522.3
million and eliminated a Marine Corps purchase of 255 M1A1 tanks.
But the Army will receive $256 million to build 163 M1A1 and 62
second generation M1A2 tanks before closing down its two tank
production plants.

Among the smaller programs trimmed in the budget was the MK-19
grenade launcher, a weapon once described as a cornerstone of
21st century Army small arms but which instead has been plagued
by quality control problems at the SACO Defense Inc. plant where
it is produced.

The Army offered to kill the MK-19 program and save $39 million,
but was overruled by Pentagon officials who decided to bankroll
4,500 of the weapons instead of the 5,001 the Army once said it
required.

One of the few winners in the Army budget was the Pentagon's
anti-satellite weapon. The Army recently won oversight
responsibility over the program from the Navy. Pentagon officials
have added $79 million to the 1991 program that allows the Army
to fund two contractors in a demonstration/validation phase.

GOLD-PLATED:

Next time you're near Marquette, Michigan, try and book a room in
K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base's V.I.P. quarters. Among the
amenities: 24-karat gold-plated bathroom fixtures and custom-
carved oak and brass doors.

Those aren't the usual digs at U.S. military bases. As a result,
the expense--particularly the $3,000 tab for the toilet trinkets--
caught the eye of congressional watchdogs. In a recently
released House Armed Services Committee hearing transcript, the
Air Force was asked to justify the lavish 1988 rehab at Sawyer in
light of cuts in flying hours for service pilots.

"While we cannot justify some of the expenditures, we view this
as an isolated incident and not indicative of the Air Force way
of conducting business," the Air Force wrote the committee.
"...The project could have been more effectively and economically
managed."

Capt. Paul Bicking, a base spokesman, said officials wanted gold-
or brass-colored fixtures to replace green chrome accoutrements.
The official who approved the purchase of the gold fixtures
selected them from a catalog without consulting a price list, he
said. "They found one that looked right. It turned out to be 24-
karat gold," Bicking said.

Base officials have instituted new policies to prevent a
recurrence of the "administrative error" that led to the mini-
scandal, Bicking said.

No word on whether the V.I.P. bathroom was equipped with one of
those $6,000 toilet seats.

GAG ME:

The Navy can't take just a little dissension. It seems quite a
few service officials haven't been toeing the Navy party line
when it comes to dealing with Congress. And what with the 1991
budget about to be unveiled, and all the expected cuts and
controversy contained therein, top-level Navy swabbies are hoping
to ensure that the monolith is well in place.

Head swabbie and Chief of Naval Operations, Carlisle Trost
recently dispatched an "Administrative Message," a.k.a. gag
order, to Navy flag officers and unit commanders.

"As available funding among programs becomes more intense, it is
absolutely critical that the department speak with a single voice
when communicating with Congress," the December order said. "In
this time of austere budgets, it is more important than ever that
we preserve our credibility with Congress. This can only be
accomplished if our representations of Navy policy are accurate
and consistent," the CNO wrote.

From now on, if a Navy official is contacted directly by a
staffer or lawmaker, the service official can respond only if the
question is of "a nonpolicy nature." Otherwise, all congressional
requests for info must be routed through the Navy comptroller or
office of legislative affairs, Trost tells his underlings.

But the CNO wants everyone to know the order isn't meant to
restrict the flow of information to the legislative branch. As
Nixon said, we could do that, but it would be wrong.

"This guidance should not be construed to interfere with, or
limit, the right of department personnel to communicate in their
individual capacity with members of Congress to the extent such
communication is protected by law or regulation," Trost wrote.

Where is George Orwell when you need him?

MOVIN' ON:

After four years, the Arms Control Association is losing James
Rubin, its assistant director. Starting Jan. 15, Rubin takes over
as Sen. Joe Biden's senior foreign policy advisor. The position
is a new one.

In his new post, Rubin--who often was the human equivalent of
one-stop shopping for quote-hungry reporters--will concentrate on
U.S.-Soviet relations, arms control, and Europe. This won't be
his first tour around Capitol Hill: during the 1988 INF debate he
served for several months as a consultant to Biden's committee.

WHO'S CALLING?

One of most infamous little stories in the annals of recent
military history involves the soldier in Grenada who supposedly
used a commercial credit card to call Fort Bragg to order an air
strike. The call was purportedly placed because military
communications between Army troops on the ground and Navy units
off shore was so poor.

But the story, however colorful, always has had its detractors.
Special Operations Command commandant Gen. James Lindsay is the
most recent official to debunk the story.

Lindsay told a closed session of the House defense appropriations
subcommitee in March that when he was commander of the 18th
Airborne Corps he tried to pin down the truth. "One popular
anecdote was that a telephone credit card call was made to call
in an air strike," Lindsay said in recently declassified
testimony. "Our research revealed no such incident occurred."

TOP-HEAVY TASK:

Computer firms interested in bidding on the Army's new computer
system for the reserves had better hire pro wrestler Hulk Hogan
to lug away the paperwork associated with the job.

The paperwork spelling out what tasks need to be automated for
something called the Reserve Component Automation System consists
of a staggering 45,000 pages and weighs about 150 pounds. The
contract is being awarded by the U.S. Army Information Systems
Selection and Acquisition Agency.

We're assured by agency officials that the basic request for
proposals weighs a lot less.

AMERICAN FLIES MiG FIGHTER

A Rand Corp. official late last month became the first American
to fly the Soviet MiG-29 fighter, the California-based think tank
said.

Rand's Ben Lambeth took off in the MiG-29 from Kubinka air base
northwest of Moscow accompanied by Valery Menitskii, the Mikoyan
Design Bureau's chief test pilot. The pathbreaking flight lasted
roughly 30 minutes.

Menitskii invited Lambeth to fly the MiG-29 during an August
meeting at Elmendorf air base in Alaska. Lambeth was in Moscow
for a five-day stay to research new developments in Soviet-
American relations.

Lambeth, a tactical airpower expert and veteran civilian pilot,
said he was impressed by the plane's performance. It compared
favorably to the U.S. F-15 and F-18, he said.

THOMSON-CSF GETS RADAR

Thomson-CSF, Inc., announced it signed a contract to supply an
experimental mode S and monopulse secondary radar station for the
French Air Navigation Department (STNA).

The contract is part of the STNA's program to modernize France's
coverage in secondary radar, the company said. This second radar
station supplied by Thomson is part of the STNA's plan to
gradually install 19 RSM 970 monopulse radar systems and then
transform the stations into mode S. Mode S is an aircraft
"selective addressing interrogation" system.

"Fully compatible with existing radar stations, the system's
advanced operational performance relies on the precision of the
monopulse technique. The number of aircraft interrogations is
reduced through very precise positioning and identification of
aircraft," Thomson said.
