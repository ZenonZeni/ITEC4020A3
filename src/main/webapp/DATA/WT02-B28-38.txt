	Just prior to the war's outbreak, New York Life had begun to give serious consideration
and intensive
study to housing as a medium for direct equity investments.  By 1946, the company was ready
to
proceed with a long-range program of investing in owned and managed housing developments.<P>
	In October 1949, the last of 3,000 families moved into Fresh Meadows, a 173-acre,
self-contained
community of 10,000 people in Queens, New York.  Built on a former golf course, Fresh Meadows
contained a department store, banks, a theater, doctors' offices, restaurants, fifty
specialty shops, a
bowling center, a post office, and a school.<P>
	All told, the housing effort was enormous.  The company estimated that it had provided,
in the five
years between 1946 and 1950, enough apartments and small homes for 300,000 people.  Besides
providing owned and managed housing in New York, New Jersey, and housing on a former slum site
in
Chicago, some $778 million was invested in more than 79,000 residential mortgage loans around
the
country, most of them for less than $10,000 each.<P>
	
	New York Life also led the way in recognizing the need for new methods to finance
thousands of
miles of superhighways, parkways, thruways, turnpikes, bridges, and tunnels as auto and truck
traffic
increased.  The company proposed revenue bonds as an alternative to government borrowing,
which
would increase federal, state, and local taxes.<P>
	For over a century, New York Life had confined its business to "ordinary" whole life
insurance for the
individual. In 1951, it was the world's largest in this category, with over 4 million
policies in force. 
During World War II, however, the inclusion of fringe benefits in labor contracts stimulated
the growth of
group insurance.  After the war, management-labor bargaining led to an almost universal use
of group
life and health insurance in multi-year contract packages.<P>
	In the mid-1950s, the company positioned itself to become more of a financial services
company
than a life insurer.  The notion of cradle to grave private insurance was revolutionary, and
New York Life
prepared to meet the ever-growing needs of the expanding nation.<P>
	While new products and services were being developed, the Home Office decided its
traditional
business needed a thorough shaking-up as well.  Assumptions, policy language, and premiums
were
not keeping pace with the rapid changes of the national economy and demographics; the
contracts
customers were signing as the company entered the 1950s were nearly the same as those their
grandfathers had signed decades ago.<P>
	When President Devereaux C. Josephs implemented a new product line, every other big
insurer tried
to follow New York Life's lead.  But New York Life agents had the pioneering advantage.  They
were first
in the market with products specifically designed for an insurance-buying public that was
becoming
more value and cost-conscious.  Everyone seemed to be going up a notch or two on the economic
ladder in one of the swiftest and most thoroughgoing changes in history.
