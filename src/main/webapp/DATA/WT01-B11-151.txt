<B>Hodgson Announces Measures to Restore Elk
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that the government will restore elk populations in Ontario.<P> 

"We want to bring elk back to Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson.  "This is a beautiful animal that was once native to much of the province. We are working with two committees to get elk restoration under way." .<P>

The two committees responsible for implementing the project are made up of representatives from interested groups and from government.  The elk restoration technical committee includes professional staff from the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Parks Canada and MNR. This committee is coordinating the technical aspects of the project, including identification of potential release sites, animal care and post-release assessment.<P>

The elk restoration advisory committee includes representatives from Cambrian College, Safari Club International, the Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Ontario Fur Managers Federation, a French River tourist outfitter and MNR. This committee is  responsible for raising the almost $200,000 needed for research, project implementation, communications and community consultation.<P>

"I am really pleased to see this wide variety of interested groups pulling together for the betterment of wildlife in Ontario," 
Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Elk disappeared from Ontario in the late 1800s because of overharvesting and changes in habitat. In the 1930s, in an effort to restore populations, elk from western Canada were introduced to several parts of the province.  Two small herds originating from that reintroduction effort still exist in the French River area south of Sudbury. Cambrian College and Laurentian University have been leading research on these herds to determine why they have not expanded over the years.<P> 

"This research will be extremely important in determining how best to proceed with the restoration program," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

A short list of potential release sites will be finalized early this winter. Consultation with local communities and interested groups will then take place.<P>

Plans are being developed for a pilot release of 50 animals at one site during the early winter of 1998. Tentative arrangements have been made to obtain these animals from Elk Island National Park in Alberta.  The elks' ability to adapt to their new environment will be carefully monitored.  Future releases will be based on the outcome of this assessment program.<P>

"This restoration project is an important part of the government's commitment to rehabilitating the Ontario landscape by restoring populations of wildlife native to the province,"  Mr. Hodgson said.<P>
