Plan Distribution!">
<BR>

So, congratulations are in order. You've just gotten a new job and well
wishes abound. You're feeling on top of the world when you hear from a
representative of your (soon-to-be-former) company's retirement plan:
What are your plans for the sum that's been accumulating in your name?
<BR><BR>

Of course, you're going to be tempted. (It's how much?) But this is more
than a left side of the brain/right side of the brain problem
confronting you. From a tax perspective, deciding whether to take your
distribution in cash or whether to roll it over is a struggle between
right and wrong. 
<BR><BR>

What should you do with your retirement plan distribution? This is one
of very few topics on which investment advisors are in complete
agreement. 
<BR><BR>
<B> Conventional Wisdom </B>
<BR><BR>
The "right" answer to the question, "What should I do with my
retirement plan distribution?" is based on a few assumptions:
<UL>
<LI> Because your contribution to your retirement plan is deducted from
your pay even before you see it (matched in some cases by employer
contributions), retirement plans are among the easiest ways to plan for
a comfortable future.
<LI> Time has a value of its own. You can never recover the time you've
already spent building a tax-deferred retirement plan.
<LI> Investments that compound on a tax-deferred basis (without their
current balances being reduced by the need to pay taxes every year) have
higher earning potential.
<LI> By virtue of their tax-deferred status, retirement plans are
endorsed
by the federal government - conversely, the government penalizes most
premature (before the age of 59 1/2) distributions from
retirement
plans.
<LI> Most investors go out of their way to minimize the amount they pay
in
federal income tax.
</UL>
<BR><BR>

<B>Your decision</B>
<BR>
You are 30 years old and your plan payout totals $20,000.
<BR><BR>

<B>You have three choices:</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>1. </B>You can take your distribution in cash.
<BR><BR> 

Do that and, assuming you're in the 28 percent tax bracket, you will owe
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 28 percent of $20,000 or $5,600 in
current income taxes. Plus, as a general rule, you'll have to pay a 10
percent penalty, or $2,000 more, for taking the distribution before
reaching age 59 1/2.
<BR><BR>

You'll have $12,400 left from your plan.
<BR><BR>

<B>2. </B>You can take your distribution in cash and move it into an
Individual
Retirement Account (IRA) or you may be able to move the cash into a
qualified retirement plan of your new company within 60 days of
receiving the check.
<BR><BR>

Your employer is required by the IRS to withhold 20 percent of your
distribution ($4,000) as a prepayment of your potential tax liability.
You won't owe current income taxes on the remaining amount - $16,000 -
as long as you roll it over within 60 days. 
<BR><BR>

Even if you roll over the $16,000 cash distribution within 60 days,
you'll owe current income taxes (28 percent of $4,000 or $1,120) and
applicable early withdrawal penalties (10 percent of $4,000 or $400) on
the $4,000 your employer paid to the IRS. The difference between the
$4,000 prepayment and the $1,520 in income taxes due represents a tax
credit, which the IRS will refund to you (less any additional income
taxes you may owe) after you file your tax return.
<BR><BR>

<B>3. </B>You could request your employer to transfer your distribution
directly into an IRA or possibly into a qualified retirement plan of
your new company. Where should your distribution be invested? Your
financial representative can review the possibilities with you.
<BR><BR>

Selecting this option would keep all $20,000 of your plan assets working
for you and you'd continue to
defer taxes until you withdraw money from your account.

The hypothetical examples in the above graph assume a 28 percent income
tax bracket and an 8 percent return, compounded monthly. This assumed
rate of return is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to
represent performance of any specific investment, which may fluctuate.
IRA and qualified retirement plan assets will be subject to current
income taxes at the time of withdrawal, under current tax law.
Calculations assume a 28 percent annual income tax liability on the
amount invested in a taxable investment.
