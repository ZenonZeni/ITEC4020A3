<h1>Renewable Energy: Hydropower</h1><p>
<p>
Hydropower converts the energy of flowing water into electricity.  The 
flowing
water passes through a turbine that spins like a pinwheel, in turn 
spinning a
generator to produce electricity.  Although most people associate 
hydropower
with large dams on rivers, hydropower also includes small dams that can 
be
located on a diversion from the main river. <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Hydropower is the largest renewable energy source in the U.S.  It 
currently
generates about 10% of the nation's electricity, and even more during 
periods
of high electrical demand.<p>

Each year, hydropower generates enough power to supply 28 million U.S.
households and represents the energy equivalent of nearly 500 million 
barrels
of oil.<p>


Hydropower is the most efficient and reliable of all renewable energy 
sources.
Hydropower plants typically operate at efficiencies of 85% to 95%. <p>
<p>
<h2>Potential Use</h2>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission estimates that the nation's 
existing
hydropower capacity could theoretically be more than doubled.  
Small-scale
hydropower plants with small diversion structures would provide much of 
this
additional capacity.<p>

New hydropower capacity does not necessarily require new dams:  only 2400 
of
the nation's 80,000 existing dams are used to generate power.  Many of 
the
others could be modified to generate power.<p>

New technologies can allow existing hydropower plants to operate more
efficiently, producing more electricity.  A 1% improvement in the 
efficiency of
the existing U.S. hydropower plants would produce enough extra power to 
supply
283,000 households.  This would save the energy equivalent of more than
5 million barrels of oil each year.<p>
<p>
<h2>Economic Benefits</h2>
The United States has invested more than $150 billion (in 1993 dollars) 
in
hydropower facilities.  This investment, largely made in the 1940s, is 
now
yielding a significant economic benefit for the nation by providing an
inexpensive, sustainable supply of electricity.<p>

In 1987, hydropower produced 17% of the electricity in industrialized 
countries
and 31% of the electricity in developing countries.  The World Energy
Conference has estimated that this number could increase fivefold.  This
represents a large market for the export of U.S. hydropower 
technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2>Environmental Benefits and Challenges</h2>
Hydropower plants produce no carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, or nitrous
oxides--no air emissions at all.  Because they produce no greenhouse gas
emissions, hydropower plants help to minimize global climate change.<p>
Hydropower plants produce no solid or liquid wastes.<p>

Hydropower projects can have an impact on water quality and fish and 
wildlife
habitats.  To address these concerns, many hydropower projects are being
retrofitted with fish ladders to encourage the upstream migration of fish 
to
their spawning grounds in the rivers' headwaters.  Many projects are also

maintaining minimum flows through the dams to encourage downstream 
migration
and maintain downstream wildlife habitats.<p>
