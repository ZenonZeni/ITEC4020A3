C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION IN FOUR ROUNDS; BIDDING TO
RESUME JAN. 5

         Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to
$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21
for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage has
been fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13
rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the
$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses will resume
Jan. 5.
         As predicted by a number of industry insiders (PCS WEEK, Dec. 13,
pp. 1-3), the top markets have been the scene of the most furious
activity.  For example, Washington, D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a
first round high bid of $11.3 million for the Chicago basic trading
area (BTA), only to have the lead taken by GWI PCS Inc. in round two
for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then upped the ante to $61.4 million
in round three.  Round four saw DCR take another shot at the lucrative
Chicago license with a bid of $70.3 million, or $8.59 per potential
subscriber in the market.  Several other markets, such as Miami and
New York, have seen similar activity.
         High bids for round four included $203 million for New York by
PCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million for
Philadelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc., headed by
former Qualcomm Inc. executive Allen Salmasi; $48.75 million for San
Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by PCS
2000.

  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction

         In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchers
and participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. 
"It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are so
many changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at Malarkey-
Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants International
Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the end of [the
auction, the environment] looks different than when it started."
Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst for
Washington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was not
reading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I think
there's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lot
greater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent that
companies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auction
environment and that there are many bidders that are not quite as
sophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."
Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets may
cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. 
Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined not
to come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,
thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some of
these companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said. 

  ...What Is PCS 2000?

Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been the
aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-based
partnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry ever
since it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of round
four, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442
million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000
had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of the
Eastern United States.  
PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners developed
and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and 25 percent
owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was incorporated
for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years ago," said
Javier Lamoso, company president.
According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limited
partnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investment
companies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[The
investors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS
2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners owns
more than 3 percent of the company.
Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did not
want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players.  He
explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS
2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets it
wants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "If
I tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,
I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCC
has interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want to
avoid any hint of implied collusion."

EQUIPMENT SUPPLY DEALS MOVE SLOWLY AS C-BLOCK AUCTION BEGINS

     Major PCS equipment contracts and agreements have all but halted
in the months preceding the C-block auction.  Only a few PCS
operators, such as Omnipoint Communications Inc., have forged pacts
with vendors. 
     The chart below comes with a few caveats:  Many of the deals
shown below are agreements or memoranda of understanding, not ironclad
contracts.  In addition, if we have missed any major PCS supply deals,

THE LONG, STRANGE TRIP OF THE C-BLOCK AUCTION

    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 gave the FCC
authority to conduct auctions for PCS licenses and directed the
commission to ensure that "designated entities" (DEs)--small
businesses, women- and minority-owned enterprises, and rural telephone
companies--could participate in the bidding.  The FCC subsequently
allocated 120 MHz of spectrum in six licensing blocks for broadband
PCS.  The so-called entrepreneurs' block or, simply, the C-block--493
30-MHz basic trading area (BTA) licenses--was reserved for DEs.
During the past year, however, the courts--in taking a new tack on
affirmative action--threw a wrench into government's efforts to allow
small players to compete with "deep pockets" in the broadband PCS
auction arena.  What follows is the long, strange trip of the C-block
auction that we documented
this past year in PCS WEEK.  (The dates below refer to the issue dates
of this newsletter.)

  ...TEC v. FCC

    Jan. 5:  The FCC announced that the C-block auction would begin
April 17, or 30 days after the close of the A/B-block auction,
whichever was later. 
Short form applications were due Feb. 28.
    Feb. 22:  Telephone Electronics Corp., a rural telephone holding
company, asked the D.C. Circuit to bar the commission from setting a
short-form filing deadline for the C-block auction.  TEC challenged
the $125 million cap on annual revenues for C-block applicants as well
as the race- and gender-based preferences for DEs.  In short, TEC
wanted the FCC to apply the revenue cap to its operating companies
instead of itself so that it would be eligible 
to bid.  Arguably, TEC's affirmative action argument was an attempt to
leverage its case.
    March 22:  The D.C. Circuit granted TEC's stay request and set oral
argument for Sept. 28.
    April 26:  TEC dropped the case after forging a deal with PCS
PrimeCo L.P. to partition the New Orleans/Baton Rouge major trading
area (MTA).

  ...Adarand v. Pena

    June 14:  The Supreme Court, in a narrow 5-4 decision, threw a
wrench
 into federal affirmative action programs in Adarand v. Pena.  The
court ruled that race- and gender-based preferences had to be
"narrowly tailored" to
serve a "compelling government interest."  Adarand was remanded to the
Tenth Circuit.
    June 21:  The FCC postponed the C-block filing deadline but
insisted that the auction would begin on time--Aug. 2.
    June 28:  The FCC granted the A/B-block licenses and adopted a
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate race- and
gender-based preferences for C-block applicants.

  ...Omnipoint v. FCC

    July 26:  In its Sixth Report and Order, the FCC modified the C-
block 
rules to eliminate women and minority preferences, and to expand the
"49 percent equity exception" to all eligible applicants.  This
exception allowed investors, including large companies, to hold 49.9
percent ownership stakes in DEs.  Pioneer's preference winner
Omnipoint Corp., owner of the A-block license for the New York MTA,
objected.
    Aug. 2:  The D.C. Circuit granted Omnipoint's emergency stay
request.  Omnipoint had argued that the expansion of the 49 percent
equity exception 
to all C-block applicants did not allow enough time for "non-women/mi-
nority" 
entities to take advantage of it.  The constitutional argument was
that the FCC's decision violated the Fifth Amendment's equal
protection clause.  Omnipoint also argued that the FCC violated the
Administrative Procedure Act by not allowing appropriate time for
public comment.
    Aug. 16:  The FCC postponed the C-block auction indefinitely as the
D.C. Circuit set Sept. 28 as the date for oral argument on the
Omnipoint case.
    Sept. 20:  The House Commerce Committee passed a measure endorsing
the FCC's C-block rules and requiring the agency to begin the auction
by Dec. 4.
        Oct. 4:  Following oral argument, the D.C. Circuit lifted its
stay.  
In a 2-1 decision, the court essentially decided that Omnipoint, an A-
block license holder, would not be harmed by expansion of the 49
percent exception in the C-block rules.  Almost immediately, the FCC
set Dec. 11 as the starting date for the auction.

  ...Cincinnati Bell v. FCC

    Oct. 25:  Radiofone Inc. asked the Sixth Circuit to stay the
auction 
in a long-pending case regarding the FCC's cellular/PCS cross-
ownership rules.  Brought by Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. [CSN],
BellSouth Corp. [BLS] and Radiofone, the consolidated cases attacked
the commission's rules for cellular eligibility, attribution, and
structural separation.  The Sixth Circuit 
granted the stay until it ruled on the issues.  Under the FCC's 
eligibility rules, Radiofone was prohibited from bidding on PCS
licenses in three Louisiana BTAs because of its cellular holdings in
the same areas.
    Nov. 1:  At the request of the FCC, Supreme Court Justice John Paul
Stevens vacated the stay imposed by the Sixth Circuit.  And the full
Supreme Court rejected Radiofone's emergency petition to overturn
Stevens.  Thus, the FCC was able to proceed with the Dec. 11 starting
date for the auction.  The FCC had argued that Radiofone could bid on
the Louisiana BTAs so long as it later complied with any rules that
the commission adopted.
    Nov. 15:  The Sixth Circuit remanded the Cincinnati Bell case, with
instructions for the FCC to conduct further proceedings.  The
commission decided to proceed with the Dec. 11 auction date.
    Nov. 22:  The shutdown of the federal government over the budget
crisis prompted the FCC to reschedule the auction starting date for
Dec. 18.  Meanwhile, Radiofone asked the Sixth Circuit to clarify that
its remand order meant that the FCC had to postpone the auction until
the agency completed a rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-ownership
issues.  Radiofone argued that if it bid on the Louisiana BTAs, there
was no guarantee that it would not be subject to future penalties or
forfeitures. 
    Dec. 6:  The Sixth Circuit issued a mandate, stating simply that it
had remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.  The court
did not address Radiofone's request or even mention the auction.  The
FCC determined that it could proceed with the Dec. 18 starting date.
    Dec. 13:  The FCC inadvertently sent proprietary financial
information from three companies, including Radiofone, to some C-block
applicants.  Separately, Radiofone again asked the FCC to stay the
auction and open an expedited rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-
ownership rules.  In addition, Radiofone filed a supplemental
memorandum with the Sixth Circuit, arguing that the court had the
power to enforce its mandate via contempt, mandamus or other
appropriate orders or writs.
    Dec. 20:  The C-block auction began despite the second shutdown of
the federal government.

INDUSTRY CANADA GRANTS FOUR PCS LICENSES, HOLDS BACK TWO

     Four Canadian PCS hopefuls received their Christmas presents a
week early when Industry Canada granted them licenses on Dec. 18 (PCS
WEEK, Dec. 20, 1995, p. 1).  The Canadian regulatory agency handed two
30 MHz licenses to specialized mobile radio (SMR) operator Clearnet
Communications Inc. and MicroCell 1-2-1 Inc.  The two 10 MHz licenses
went to cellular operator Rogers Cantel Mobile Inc. and Mobility
Canada--a nationwide alliance of local exchange carriers' cellular
subsidiaries.
    The four winners beat 15 other candidates for the licenses
ostensibly because they came closest to meeting Industry Canada's
policy objectives for PCS, which included the stimulation of
additional choices in mobile services similar to cellular and the
support of new technologies; the provision of new and innovative
services at 2 GHz, rather than mere provision of upbanded cellular
services; nationwide and worldwide roaming for Canadian citizens; non-
discriminatory access to the networks in order to allow third parties
to resell services; and the promotion of jobs and investment in
Canada.

  ...MicroCell Was Heavy Favorite, Insiders Say

    Although many in the Canadian PCS industry assumed that the 10 MHz
licenses would go to Cantel and Mobility Canada, the 30 MHz licenses
were harder to call.  According to a number of sources that spoke to
us before Industry Canada's announcement, MicroCell was the heavy
favorite for one of the licenses.
    In a news release following the licensing announcement, MicroCell
said that the government endorsed its open-network concept, under
which it will allow any company interested in reselling PCS to access
its system.  "We will allow access to our network to all companies and
entrepreneurs who want to market PCS," said Andre Tremblay, MicroCell
president and CEO.
    In addition, MicroCell promised to create a $90 million (Canadian)
research and development fund "aimed at backing the projects of
entrepreneurs who could not otherwise participate in PCS development. 
"We are prepared to finance innovative projects," explained Tremblay. 
"Those who have good ideas for new PCS applications are invited to
knock at our door."
    MicroCell has chosen the global system for mobile communications-
base PCS-1900 technology for its network and has supply agreements
with L.M. Ericsson AB and Northern Telecom Ltd..

  ...Clearnet Sees PCS Complementing ESMR

    The other 30 MHz winner, Clearnet, believes that it edged out the
other candidates based on its preparation for PCS buildout as well as
its experience with SMR.
    Over the past year, the company has raised more than $250 million
in capital for the construction of both its PCS and enhanced SMR
(ESMR) networks. 
    "We have had an objective to be the third major wireless service
provider [in Canada] since the company announced [Motorola's equity
stake in Clearnet] in February 1994," said George Cope, Clearnet
president and CEO, during a press conference conducted the day after
Industry Canada granted the licenses.  "I think we've now gone a long
way to enhance our position there."
    Clearnet also views PCS as the consumer complement to its ESMR
business services.  The company is in the process of completing the
first phase of its ESMR system buildout that will cover a region from
Quebec City to Windsor. Clearnet expects to begin commercial service
in mid-1996.
    "We have our business communications network--our ESMR network--
which is focused ... particularly on enhanced services all in one
handset," said Cope.  
"We view PCS as complementing [ESMR] as a product that will be able to
focus on the mass consumer market."
    Clearnet also intends to save a great deal on its PCS construction
costs by combining PCS with its ESMR system wherever possible.  These
savings will be passed on to the consumer, Cope said.  "We believe
that we also will be the lowest-cost PCS provider of the [two 30 MHz
licensees]," he added.
    The Pickering, Ontario-based company built out all of its ESMR
sites with the capability to carry PCS equipment as well, Cope
explained.  "A significant part of the total cost in designing a
wireless system are the soft costs of the sites--we won't have to
incur those costs a second time," he said.
    In addition, Cope said that Clearnet intends to share some of the
leased lines with both services.  Billing services for PCS will come
from the same company that Clearnet is using for ESMR, he said. 

  ...What About the Other Two Licenses?

    In its news release on PCS licensing, Industry Canada did not
comment on the fate of the remaining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses,
leaving many of those companies that did not receive licenses
wondering if there still was a chance to get into the market in the
next few years.  Industry Canada retained the right to hold back
licenses if it believed that there were not enough qualified
candidates, or if the agency determined that the Canadian market could
not sustain six PCS players.
    According to Kirk Hamilton, vice president of corporate and
government affairs for paging operator and PCS applicant TeleZone
Corp., Industry Canada has not given his company any indication of
what will happen to the licenses.  "They basically issued the licenses
and went off on holiday," he said.  "We hope to get some answers in
the new year."
    As for the future, Hamilton said that TeleZone will be looking for
other wireless opportunities as they come up.  But in the near term,
"our primary objective is to get access to the license that's still
unawarded at this time."

CDG COMPLETES TESTS ON 13-KILOBIT VOCODER SPECS

     The Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Development Group (CDG)
recently finished testing and finalizing the specifications for the
13-kilobit per second vocoder algorithm.  The group expects the
higher-rate digital speech coder/decoder to bring CDMA systems near
wireline speech quality.  The vocoder is compatible with existing CDMA
systems, CDG said.  (Perry LaForge, Pittaglio Rabin Todd and McGrath,

T1 DEVELOPS GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS PCS SECURITY

    The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions' Committee
T1-Telecommunications recently completed guidelines to address user
privacy and other security issues involving PCS.  Among other things,
the guidelines call for five common security requirements, including
user authentication, the ability to conceal a user's location to
prevent eavesdropping, bearer and signalling channel privacy for all
wireless terminals, user data stored in "smart cards," and the
exchange of security information among different PCS networks.  (Bob

INTERCEL PREPARES TO LAUNCH STOCK, NOTE OFFERINGS TO FINANCE PCS
BUILDOUT

     West Point, Ga.-based InterCel Inc. anticipates spending $110
million this year to build out Powertel PCS Partners L.P.'s PCS
markets, followed by an additional commitment of $150 million in 1997.
    In its latest annual report, the company disclosed that it plans to
make concurrent public offerings of stock and notes during the first
quarter of 1996.
    Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5
million and $150 million, respectively.  Cash interest on the notes
will not be payable before 2001.  InterCel also is negotiating a $20
million revolving credit facility.

  ...Offerings Coincide With InterCel's Buyout of Powertel

    The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with the cellular
operator's plans to acquire Powertel, a privately held consortium in
which InterCel already is a major participant (PCS WEEK, June 28,
1995, p. 7).
    The three licenses that Powertel won in the A/B-block auction cover
parts of nine Southeastern states with 9 million potential subscribers
or "pops."  After the initial phase of its buildout, Powertel will
serve 55 percent of the pops in its major trading areas, InterCel
said.
    InterCel chose global system for mobile communications-based PCS-
1900 as its technology standard last August (PCS WEEK, Aug. 30, 1995,
p. 7), but has yet to announce equipment contracts.

  ...Equipment Vendor Negotiations Continue 

    At our deadline, the company was continuing negotiations with
equipment supplier candidates regarding vendor financing.  "The
company currently believes that vendor financing may provide a
significant amount of the capital required for its PCS system,"
InterCel's annual report said.
    While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positive
operating income," InterCel warned that management "expects to incur
