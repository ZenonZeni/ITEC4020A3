<PRE>
If you decide not to use a raised bed then you must prepare the area
first.

<STRONG><H2>Laying out your garden</H2></STRONG>
     Draw a plan for what you want to grow in your raised bed. Keep the
tallest on one side with the smallest to the opposite side. If you have
more  then one raised decide which plants will grow where. Change  this
design  every year so as not to grow the same plants in the same  place
year after year.

<STRONG><H2>Location</H2></STRONG>
     Choosing  a  location for your raised bed is very  important.  The
location  needs to be close to the kitchen to provide easy  access  for
the  cook.  The location must provide at least 6 to 8 hrs  direct  sun,
with  the  more the better. Must have proper drainage. So take  a  walk
around  your  place and see if you can pick the perfect  spot.  Another
consideration is water, it must have a close source.

<STRONG><H2>Garden Filter</H2></STRONG>
     Never  use  city  water  in  your raised  bed.  Many  cities  have
chlorine(or  ?) in their city water. Chlorine kills bacteria,  that  is
what  it does best. However an organic garden requires natural bacteria
in  order  to function correctly. A garden filter will help  keep  your
garden  alive!  You  will notice an increase in in  worms  and  in  the
gardens  overall health. An excellent Garden Filter is  available  thru
Real Goods.

<STRONG><H2>Putting together the Raised Bed</H2></STRONG>
     A  good raised bed should be at least 4ft x 10 ft x 12 inches high
x  at  least  2  inches thick. Use non treated wood. The  wood  can  be
screwed  together for easy break down when needed. If you have  gophers
in  your  area,  you will want to screen the bottom  with  extra  heavy
chicken  wire.  The size of the bed depends on the area and  amount  of
space you have to use. An ideal situation is to have two or more raised
beds. One 4ft x 12ft x 12 inches x 2 inches can produce enough food for
a  family of four. More beds allow you to rotate the beds and allow one
bed to grow green cover which can be turned over.

<STRONG><H2>Filling in the Raised Bed</H2></STRONG>

The  following should fit just right into the raised bed. You will have
to use what you find in your area.
     Start  out  with a good layer of old horse manure. To this  I  add
either   LLama   pellets  or  Rabbit  pellets(nature's  time   released
fertilizer). Add 20 lbs of rock dust or any other trace mineral source.
Add  20  lbs bone meal, 20 lbs alfalfa meal and 2 bales aged wood.  Mix
well. Water well(water slowly to allow soil to absorb). To this mixture
add  500  lbs compost(if you have it) other wise add enough  old  horse
manure  to  fill up to 4 inches from the top. Add another 2 bales  aged
wood  or  KRA wood product or any light soil. Add another 20  lbs  rock
dust,  20 lbs bone meal, 20 lbs alfalfa meal. The aged wood will insure
the  PH will be at the right place. A good PH for the garden is 6.5  to
6.8.  Blend  everthing in together, watering as  you  go.  Finally  add
enough  mulch to fill the raised bed up to the top. Remember that  this
soil will settle after a few days, so keep a few bags of mulch handy to
fill to top when needed.
