<p><b>What Treatment is Available for Bulimia Nervosa?</b> </p>
<p>We offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment to women age 18 through 50 who meet 
<a href="diagBuli.htm">diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa</a>. </p>
<p>Research studies currently underway for bulimia nervosa aim to clarify the importance of 
a variety of psychological and biological disturbances in the development of this eating 
disorder. Eligible individuals who <a href="Unitdata.htm">participate in these studies</a> may receive inpatient or 
outpatient care at <strong>no charge</strong>.</p>
<p>In the past we have conducted studies examining the use of cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in the treatment of bulimia nervosa. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on how one's attitudes about food, dieting, weight, 
and body shape may affect behavior. Interpersonal therapy focuses on examining 
interpersonal relationships and how they affect eating habits and attitudes. </p>
<p>Since the research on the unit frequently changes, we are unable to provide details on 
what studies are currently available. You can, of course, contact us for more details. 
Typical research can take anywhere from an afternoon to a few months. Participants in the 
IPT &amp; CBT study mentioned above received approximately 19 sessions of individual 
psychotherapy (either cognitive behavioral or interpersonal) free of charge over the 
course of four months. </p>
