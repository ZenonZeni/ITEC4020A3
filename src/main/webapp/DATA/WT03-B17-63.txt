<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="Bikini.jpg" WIDTH="250">After <A HREF="bikinifh.html"><B>successful visit to Bikini</B></A> in November of 96 we are running further trips there in 1997.  Between February and November you will be able to experience the world's first underwater nuclear graveyard.  Bikini has just reopened to the public and is claiming it's place among the wreck diving wonders of the world ahead of Truk Lagoon, Scapa Flow and Rabul Harbor.
<P>In its four decades of recovery, Bikini has been off limits to inhabitation, development and fishing.  The result has been the growth of reefs with an overwhelming abundance of tropical marine life as exists nowhere else on earth.  Official government divers and military personnel, who have been there, report that the water is thick with sharks, sailfish and schools of tuna.  This is to such an extent that they are avoiding night dives until more is known about the nocturnal habits of the sharks.  Even more interesting to advanced divers, is the phenomenal opportunity to dive the untouched wrecks: USS Saratoga, USS Arkansas, USS Pilotfish and HIJMS Nagato.  
<P><B>USS Saratoga</B> - a US Navy aircraft carrier with a waterline length of 830 feet and a flight deck of 888 feet.  At the time of the Baker blast, her armament consisted of: three Helldiver single engine dive bombers and an Avenger single engine torpedo bomber that can be found in the hangar; eight paired and twelve single 38 caliber guns and 76 anti-aircraft guns.  Live ammunition can be found on and around the vessel.  The Saratoga sank on July 25, 1946.  She lies upright in 180 feet of water with her superstructure at 70 feet, her deck at 100 feet and the hangars at 130 feet. She is the only diveable US aircraft carrier in the world.  By popular demand, she will be the focus of nine of our twelve dives.
<P><B>USS Arkansas</B> - a US battleship, 562 feet long with a 106 foot beam.  It is believed that the Arkansas was literally smashed down to the sea floor after the Baker blast in 1946.  She lies seriously damaged and inverted on the bottom, in 180 feet.  Heavy armaments can still be found and many passageways run through the ship.
<P><B>USS Pilotfish</B> - a 312 foot long US submarine.  During the Baker blast, the Pilotfish was moored at depth, 363 yards away from ground zero.  She is almost completely intact, lying at 170 feet. 
<P><B>HIJMS Nagato</B> - Admiral Yamamoto's battleship.  Considered the flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy, this was the command ship for the attack on Pearl Harbor and, then, the sight of the Japanese surrender.  She was armed with eight 45 caliber guns, twenty 50 caliber guns, four anti-aircraft guns, three machine guns and eight torpedo tubes.  The Nagato  sank on July 29, 1946, a few days after the Baker blast detonated near her.  She lies inverted in 160 to 170 feet of water.
