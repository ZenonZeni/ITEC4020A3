<H2 ALIGN="center"><B><A NAME="WASDA POLICIES">POLICIES</A></B></H2>
<P ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</P>
<H4 ALIGN="left"><B>AASA ELECTION POLICY</B></H4>
<P>(Financial support for candidates)</P>
<P>In order for a candidate running for AASA office to qualify for financial assistance from the WASDA, the candidate first must receive the endorsement of the WASDA Board of Directors.  Any WASDA candidate that receives the endorsement of the WASDA Board of Directors shall receive financial assistance on a matching basis not to exceed $500.  Thus, the candidate would have to spend a minimum of $1,000 of his/her own money in order to receive $500 from the WASDA.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION</B></P>
<P>A.The association should continue this committee and take the initiative in arranging for a joint meeting with representatives from the various state administrative and supervisory groups in an effort to reach mutual agreement on guidelines for compensation.</P>
<P>B.The guidelines reached through the mutual efforts and agreement of the administrative groups should be presented to the WASB by the WASDA committee at a joint committee meeting.  This joint committee should be charged with the development of administrative compensation guidelines that can be submitted to the various administrative groups for their approval.</P>
<P>C.A document should result from the successful implementation of the above recommendations that will provide uniform guidelines for the compensation of administrators in all Wisconsin public schools.</P>
<P>D.The committee recommends that the association encourage all districts to develop written plans that include the rationale used to compensate the administrative staff.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATIVE EVALUATIONS</B></P>
<P>Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators endorse the concept that written evaluations be provided each member of the administrative team on an annual basis.  The written evaluation would be utilized when the decision process is used regarding the renewal or the nonrenewal of any member of the administrative team's contract with the local school district.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATOR SHORTAGE</B></P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators is concerned with the current and developing shortage of qualified candidates for entry level administrative and middle management positions in the state.  This situation, if not corrected, will create a vacuum of leadership in Wisconsin schools at a time when the challenges facing public education are greater than at any time in our state's history.</P>
<P>The shortage of qualified candidates, it is believed by WASDA, has been caused by a number of factors.  The main contributing forces are:</P>
<P>1.The large number of current administrators nearing retirement age.  This is borne out by studies completed in the state.</P>
<P>The number of retirees will be accelerated by the early retirement window and permanent retirement benefit changes recently enacted.</P>
<P>2.The lack of financial incentive for talented educators to leave the classrooms and move into administrative positions as in the past.  Teacher salaries have increased to the point that many assistant principals, principals, supervisors, and coordinators make less than their counterparts in the classroom.  This is not only the case when comparisons are made on the basis of daily rate of pay, which has been a reality for years, but on an annual salary basis.</P>
<P>3.The increased demands on administrators in the rapidly changing world of education.  The level of training, experience and knowledge necessary to deal with the stresses, decisions, and problems in a modern school system have increased dramatically.  This has led to potentially talented administrators selecting less challenging positions with equal or greater material rewards.</P>
<P>4.The lack of convenient administrative training opportunities for practicing educators.</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators recognizes that a long term solution to the situation cannot be developed and implemented quickly or easily.  However, institutions and organizations concerned with the quality of schools and school leadership need to work together to develop a long range approach to supplying leadership for Wisconsin's schools.</P>
<P>There are some short range solutions to easing the shortage that should be considered pending development of a more permanent resolution of the problem.  They include:</P>
<P>1.The development of incentive grants for local districts or consortiums to provide for administrative training programs for promising educators.  This could be combined with internships to provide a more practical and relevant program.</P>
<P>2.Encouragement of institutions of higher learning to offer more administrative training programs.  Efforts should be made to take the programs to the clients at times and in locations that encourage enrollment.  The advice of practicing administrators should be sought in designing and establishing these programs.  Qualified practitioners could be used as a valuable teaching resource.</P>
<P>3.School boards and district administrators need to recognize and respond to the need to provide greater financial incentives to encourage individuals to enter the administrative field and continue in the field.</P>
<P>The cooperative efforts of the DPI, colleges and universities, local universities, local districts, legislators, and professional education associations will be necessary to develop and implement these recommendations.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM CONCEPT</B></P>
<P>The administrative team as it is perceived in education is comprised of all members of the school administrative staff.  The team will vary as to size of school districts, as to job description, and as representatives are selected at all levels.</P>
<P>Proper organization to facilitate maximum involvement of all members in decisions relating to school district policy is imperative.  If the community is to benefit, goal setting, evaluation of achieved goals and implementation of positive outcomes, must be an integral part of the administrative team function.</P>
<P>There is no single formula to prescribe procedures and techniques that are mandatory in implementing the administrative team style of operation.  Each school district must consider these problems in the context of local conditions.</P>
<P>Those responsible for the direction of public education are continually responding to pressures and criticisms, both from within and outside the institution itself.  It has become impossible to effectively manage the educational institution without some formalized structure that assures the input of all components of management in the decision making process and a free flow of communication among the board, the administration, the instructional staff, students, parents and the general public.</P>
<P><B>PRINCIPLES FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM</B></P>
<P>A.Administrators responsible for implementing policies should provide input when the policies are developed.</P>
<P>B.Group decision making:</P>
<P> 1.Increases the quality of the decision.</P>
<P> 2.Reduces the usual errors of chance which occur when one person makes the decision.</P>
<P> 3.Increases the security of the risk taken through decision making.</P>
<P> 4.Improves the rationality and consistency of administration.</P>
<P>C. Involvement as a team:</P>
<P> 1.Increases motivation and staff morale.</P>
<P> 2. Improves individual productivity and school district climate.</P>
<P> 3.Strengthens individual administrator's commitment to district goals.</P>
<P>D.The involvement of many individuals provides more creative solutions which enhance the potential of the school district.</P>
<P>E.Group decision making facilitates the implementation of the plans developed.</P>
<P>F.School boards must adopt formal policy statements supporting the concept of the school administrative team.</P>
<P>G.Discussion between administrative team members and school boards in respect to conditions affecting individual welfare and working conditions are not inconsistent with the concept of the administrative team.</P>
<P><B>AWARDS COMMITTEE</B></P>

<P><B>CENSORSHIP AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM</B></P>
<P>WASDA is concerned about indiscriminate, arbitrary, and/or capricious efforts to censor and limit academic freedom. WASDA urges school boards to adopt appropriate policy for the selection, evaluation and removal of instructional materials.</P>
<P><B>COLLECTIVE BARGAINING</B></P>
<P><U>Collective Bargaining</U></P>
<P>The WASDA recognizes collective bargaining as a legal and reasonable method for determining wages, hours and conditions of employment for nonsupervisory school district employees.</P>
<P><U>Impasse Resolution</U></P>
<P>The WASDA recognizes arbitration as a means of resolving bargaining impasses.  The WASDA further declares its opposition to the use of strikes by school district employees as a means of resolving bargaining impasse.</P>
<P>While the association supports binding arbitration and the arbitration &quot;all or none&quot; law, WASDA believes that the current impasse resolution procedures of the municipal collective bargaining law seriously hamper good faith bargaining in Wisconsin's public sector.  In that regard, the WASDA supports these changes to the current law:</P>
<P>1.A specific cut-off date shall be established at the close of the investigation conducted by the mediator prohibiting any further opportunity for either party to change their proposed positions as submitted to the arbitrator.</P>
<P>2.Require that when a petition is filed for binding arbitration, the WERC shall require the petitioning party to submit its final offer on each issue in the dispute with the petition.</P>
<P>3.The second party shall submit its final offer on each issue to the arbitrator within 14 days of the receipt of the petitioning party's final offer.  Once the second party submits its final offer, it can no longer modify the language or add any new issues.</P>
<P>4.The current provision in the statutes whereby a petition for arbitration must include a preliminary final offer shall be deleted.  In essence, it is the position of the WASDA that the offer submitted by the petitioning party and the offer submitted by the second party shall constitute their final offers.</P>
<P>5.The arbitrator shall give consideration to local and/or area economic conditions and indicators such as localemployment levels, local business climate and monetary adjustments in locally negotiated public and private settlements.</P>
<P>6.In addition to the direct economic conditions to be considered by the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall <U>also</U> consider both the immediate and the long range economic impact the language and policy modifications will have upon the educational programs available to the students at the local school district level.</P>
<P>7.Arbitrators shall be required to hold a public hearing with meaningful prior notice given to the citizens of the jurisdiction served by the municipal employer.  Comments by the citizens of the jurisdiction shall be part of the hearing record and shall be given consideration by the arbitrator.</P>
<P>8.The arbitrator shall be required to issue the award within forty-five (45) days of the arbitration hearing.</P>
<P>9.The WERC arbitrators shall be determined by chance rather than by selection by the two parties.  However, this does not prohibit the two parties to jointly select an arbitrator from outside of the WERC appointment.  Also, the WASDA recommends the arbitrators to be selected from the same region, area or congressional district, when possible, of the school district involved in the arbitration process.</P>
<P>10.The WERC shall evaluate arbitrators on a regular basis and shall remove arbitrators it finds unsatisfactory, as well as those who repeatedly fail to issue timely decisions or who do not participate in adequate training programs.</P>
<P>11.The WASDA supports the concept that the arbitrators shall select either the board's or the union's final offer.</P>
<P>    (Adopted as revised April 23, 1987)</P>
<P><B>COMMUNITY EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>1.Whereas, community education is based on the concept that education is a life-long process designed for people of all ages, and</P>
<P>2.Whereas, community education is based on the needs of people in the community and coordinates community resources and facilities.</P>
<P>3.Whereas, communities need effective coordination of services and identification of educational needs for all age groups, in this time of limited funds and inflationary periods; and</P>
<P>4.Whereas, the changing nature of communities, whether it be energy use, larger adult and senior citizen population, or single parent families, call upon education to consider the educational needs of all residents, and</P>
<P>5.Whereas, public schools have resources and buildings which are paid for by the community and generally available for use by the public.</P>
<P>6.Therefore be it resolved, the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators endorse the concept of community education; and</P>
<P>7.Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA urge its members to develop community education programs which will serve a broad cross section of their constituents which are oriented to the unique needs of diverse populations within the school community.</P>
<P><B>CONSTITUTION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, the WASDA represents the educational leadership in the state of Wisconsin with the specific purpose of excellence in education, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the WASDA shall promote educational welfare of Wisconsin youths; professional growth and welfare ofadministrative, teaching and other school district personnel; placing the needs, problems and achievements of public schools to district residents; area meetings of educational leaders for the discussion of common interest; and to cooperate with the professional organizations and other organizations interested in improving education.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA select a Constitution Committee to monitor the association's activities in respect to compliance with the constitution and bylaws of the association, and</P>
<P>Further be it resolved that the committee review the constitution and bylaws on a yearly basis for the purpose of recommending changes made necessary or appropriate because of circumstances or progressive outmoding to the membership.</P>
<P><B>CURRICULUM</B></P>
<P>We support the position that the curriculum of public schools is a local district decision, and legislation mandates to enact curriculum for the public schools be opposed.</P>
<P><B>DATA PROCESSING CENTERS</B></P>
<P>Data processing centers to serve local school systems are a necessity if further procedures of cost accounting, program planning-budgeting, assessment, comprehensive planning, research and evaluation are to take place.</P>
<P>WASDA will support legislation to have date processing centers established with state financing to serve the local school systems and that there be continued DPI leadership in planning for the development of these centers.</P>
<P><B>DISMISSAL OR REHIRING OF TEACHERS</B></P>
<P>WASDA recognizes that negotiations are not completed in most districts before March 15 and State Statute 118.22, Section 2, requires that teachers be notified whether or not they are going to be retained or dismissed on or before this date.  This is approximately four months before the end of the school year and is a detriment to both teachers and students.  WASDA recommends that legislation be introduced to change Wisconsin Statute 118.22, Section 2, to read April 15 instead of March 15 and May 15 instead of April 15.</P>
<P><B>EMPLOYEE RECORDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B></P>
<P>The following guidelines are recommended to all school personnel dealing with confidential records and statements concerning past and present employees:</P>
<P>1.Know the liability insurance coverage in the district--coverage for omission and errors is comparable to malpractice insurance carried by medical doctors and dentists.</P>
<P>2.Base comments only on firsthand knowledge which can be documented with records, if necessary.</P>
<P>3.Avoid stating opinions that cannot be substantiated.</P>
<P>4.Limit the response to questions about present and past teachers to the professional qualifications of the person.</P>
<P>5.Never furnish an unsolicited negative recommendation.</P>
<P>6.Make every effort to restrict the communication to proper officials.</P>
<P>7.Avoid telephone evaluations since there is a tendency to speak in broader terms and give opinions without substantiation.</P>
<P>8.Be particularly careful if a personality conflict exists between you and a teacher if that person is involved in areas such as negotiations.</P>
<P>9.Discontinue the practice of making generalizations or subjective opinions relative to a person.</P>
<P><B>ETHICAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES</B></P>
<P>1.In situations where a teacher employed in one district seeks employment in another district, it is the responsibility of the administrator who is considering offering new employment to the teacher to communicate with the administration of the district where the teacher is currently employed.</P>
<P>2.A school administrator should not initiate action which encourages a teacher to break a contract with another district.</P>
<P>3.An administrator should not permit a teacher to teach in his/her district when that teacher is under contract to teach in another district but is not fulfilling the contract.</P>
<P>4.Before a contract is offered to a teacher, it should be specifically determined that the teacher is legally able to sign the contract.</P>
<P>5.At no time should the hiring administrator visit prospective employees in school districts without the knowledge and permission of the local school administration.</P>
<P>6.Applicants who have been under consideration and placement offices where vacancies are posted should be informed when vacancies are filled.</P>
<P><B>ETHICS</B></P>
<P>I. INITIATING ACTION</P>
<P>Problems involving the ethical conduct of any school administrator shall be referred to the state Ethics Committee.  Except as otherwise provided herein, any complaint about the ethical behavior of an administrator or request for an investigation of his/her conduct must be presented in written form to the state Ethics Committee or executive body of the WASDA, and must bear the signature of the person or persons making the complaint or requesting an investigation.  Neither the state Ethics Committee nor the Executive Committee of WASDA shall initiate action on the basis of hearsay, or oral request, anonymous letter or other unsigned documents.</P>
<P>When circumstances exist which may indicate a possible violation of ethical behavior and no formal written complaint has been filed with either the Ethics Committee or the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, by majority vote, direct the Ethics Committee to make a &quot;preliminary investigation.&quot;  The purpose of this preliminary investigation will be to ascertain the facts connected with a specific situation to determine whether or not a formal investigation should be conducted.  Any member whose behavior is being questioned by this method shall be so notified.  All reports of preliminary investigation shall be filed in written form with the Board of Directors and a copy given to the member whose behavior is being questioned.  No disciplinary action will be taken as a result of a preliminary investigation.</P>
<P>Written and signed complaints received by the Ethics Committee shall be disposed of, after due deliberation or investigation by a quorum of the committee at least ninety days from the receipt of the complaint.  The committee may take any one of the following actions:</P>
<P>1.Drop the complaint for lack of reliable evidence or because the charges are inconsequential.</P>
<P>2.Drop the complaint on the grounds that it involves a question of administrative judgment rather than ethical behavior.</P>
<P>3.Authorize and institute a special investigation or hearing.</P>
<P>4. Issue a warning.</P>
<P>5.File a recommendation for disciplinary action with the WASDA Executive Committee.</P>
<P>Investigations authorized by the state Ethics Committee shall be organized on the basis of teams of no less than three nor more than seven investigators with the qualifications necessary to gather accurate data on the submitted complaint.  The revocation of an administrator's certificate by a legally constituted state authority, conviction by a court for a criminal offense, or censorshipby a duly recognized national or state professional organization or committee may constitute grounds for initiating an investigation by the state Ethics Committee.</P>
<P>Special hearings may be convened by the state Ethics Committee subsequent to the report or recommendation of an investigating committee.  Hearings should be confined to charges made known to the accused in writing.  The accused should be apprised in writing of his/her professional rights and responsibilities, including the right to obtain legal counsel at his/her own expense.  The chairperson of the Ethics Committee shall preside over hearings convened by that body.  Hearings based on an investigation of facts in evidence should not be confused with hearings related to appeals from the judgment of the Ethics Committee or WASDA Executive Committee.</P>
<P>II. JUDGMENTS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</P>
<P>Judgments rendered by the state Ethics Committee shall be based on careful investigation of the validity of charges, after any necessary hearings have been held, and in the light of deliberations by at least a quorum of the committee.  The judgment should be recorded in the official minutes of the committee.</P>
<P>When it becomes necessary to institute disciplinary measures for conduct judged to be unethical, the following penalties may be used at the discretion of the Ethics Committee or the Executive Committee of WASDA:</P>
<P>1.<U>Warnings or reprimands</U>.  Such action may be taken by the state Ethics Committee or WASDA Executive Committee.  Written warnings or reprimands shall not be released by the committee but shall be considered a confidential exchange between a member and the state Ethics Committee or the Executive Committee.  The person judged to have violated the Code of Ethics may at his/her own discretion release the nature of the warning or reprimands shall insist that unethical behavior cease or more severe disciplinary action may be taken.</P>
<P>2.<U>Suspension</U>.  The state Ethics Committee may recommend suspension from membership to the Executive Committee of WASDA and may also make such recommendations to the AASA Ethics Committee.  Decision on suspension from the state association shall rest with the Executive Committee, and final decision on suspension from AASA shall rest with the AASA Executive Committee.  During the period of suspension, which shall be for no less than one year and no more than five years, a member shall--</P>
<P> A.not have membership status;</P>
<P> B. be relieved of all committee assignments;</P>
<P> C. not hold or be eligible for any association office;</P>
<P> D. not be sent any publications of the association, and;</P>
<P> E.not be invited to attend or participate in an official manner in any professional meetings held under the auspices of the association from which he has been suspended.  During the last six months of a suspension, WASDA Ethics Committee shall review the record of a suspended member and recommend to WASDA Executive Committee whether the period of suspension shall be terminated at the appointed time, extended or changed to expulsion.</P>
<P>3.<U>Expulsion</U>.  Expulsion implies permanent and total severance of relations with the professional association. Expulsion and details of expulsion shall remain a matter between the administrator and Executive Committee unless the administrator wishes to make it public.  Only WASDA Executive Committee has authority to expel a member. WASDA shall notify the AASA in writing when a member is expelled from the state association.</P>
<P>Any recommendation by the Ethics Committee for suspension or expulsion that is subsequently approved shall be considered effective on the date it is filed formally with the Executive Committee even though formal action is taken at a later date.</P>
<P>The exception to this shall be where a petition for appeal has been filed within the time limits specified below.  In appealed cases, suspensions or expulsions that are approved subsequently by the Board of Directors shall be recorded in the formal records as effective from the date the written petition for appeal was received in the office of the president or the Executive Director of WASDA.</P>
<P>All disciplinary recommendations and actions, along with memoranda of investigations shall be matters of written records. These records shall be kept in the permanent and confidential files of the committee and association.</P>
<P>III.  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS</P>
<P>Every WASDA member shall be presumed to be innocent of ethical transgressions until evidence proves to the contrary.  The administrator has available the following rights and avenues of appeal whenever ethical conduct is questioned and at all levels of disciplinary procedure the administrator has the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
<P>1.Any member whose ethical conduct is under question shall be notified in writing by registered letter by the state Ethics Committee that a complaint has been received questioning his/her ethical behavior and that sufficient grounds exist to institute further investigation of the facts pertaining to the case.</P>
<P>2.Any member whose ethical conduct is under question is entitled to written notice of specific charges lodged against him/her and to know the name(s) of his/her accuser(s).</P>
<P>3.Any member whose ethical conduct is questioned shall have the right to appear at any session where complaints concerning his/her ethical conduct are under review.  The Ethics Committee shall inform the accused member of its recommendations, including recommendations for disciplinary action, if any, at the same time its recommendations are filed with the Executive Committee.</P>
<P>4.Any member subject to suspension or expulsion from WASDA shall be notified in writing by the President that WASDA Ethics Committee has recommended to the WASDA Executive Committee that the member be suspended or expelled from WASDA membership.  He/she shall be informed of the time limits within which an appeal may be made and of appeal procedures.</P>
<P>5.The WASDA Executive Committee shall establish a satisfactory time and date for a hearing.  The Ethics Committee and the member shall be present to make statements.  The hearing must be held within 60 days of the Ethics Committee recommendations.</P>
<P>6.The Executive Committee will take action following the hearing.  If suspension or expulsion is determined by majority vote of the Executive Committee, notice will be provided the member with an outline of the procedures for appeal.</P>
<P>IV. APPEAL PROCEDURE</P>
<P>Every member has the right to appeal suspension or expulsion by the Executive Committee.  An appeal must be filed within 60 days following the date of written notification for suspension or expulsion by the Executive Committee.</P>
<P>A petition for appeal shall be made in writing to the Executive Director of WASDA.  A petition to appeal the decision of the Executive Committee to the complete membership of the WASDA Board of Directors shall be made through the office of the Executive Director.</P>
<P>It shall be the responsibility of the Board of Directors to notify the appellant within 60 days of the receipt of the petition of the time and place for the hearing of the appeal to show cause why the decision of the Executive Committee should not be approved and implemented.  The Board of Directors decision shall be final.</P>
<P>The accused member shall bear all his/her personal and privately contracted legal expenses incurred in appearing before a state Ethics Committee, as well as in final appeals to the state Executive Committee and Board of Directors.</P>
<P><B>V. REVIEW PROCEDURE</B></P>
<P>Any accused member has the right to request that his/her case be reopened and judgements reevaluated whenever new evidence becomes available.  The request shall be made in writing to WASDA Ethics Committee.  The Ethics Committee shall examine the evidence and determine whether sufficient grounds exist for reopening and reevaluating the case.  The decision of WASDA Ethics Committee shall be final, and no further appeals are available from it.</P>
<P><B>VI. ETHICS OF NON-MEMBERS OF WASDA</B></P>
<P>The behavior of all administrators, non-members, as well as members of WASDA, influences the public image of school administrators.  The public may find it difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish on the basis of limited contact between apractitioner who belongs to a professional society and one who does not.  All too often it is assumed that those who practice the same profession are members of the same professional society.  WASDA must demonstrate concern for the ethical behavior of all practicing administrators even though its influence may be greater among members than non-members.</P>
<P><B>EVALUATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the desirability of program and service evaluation at all levels of education in Wisconsin.  The focus of such evaluations shall be on improvement so as to offer students in Wisconsin the best learning opportunities possible. Such evaluations shall be used to determine modifications in existing programs and the identification of unmet needs.  It is also WASDA's position that the responsibility for providing quality education rests with the local school districts.  Therefore, continuous efforts should be made to avoid the need for or imposition of legislative mandates.  WASDA further endorses the desirability of national and state educational assessment programs as additional means to assess local programs.</P>
<P>Finally, WASDA strongly favors and encourages efforts by institutions of higher education and other professional organizations which strive to develop meaningful criteria and measures for the evaluation of educational programs.</P>
<P><B>FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that there is an appropriate place in the scheme of American education for the participation of the federal government through a financial and fiscal participation, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA is committed to the historic and constitutional position of local control of local government functions, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA while respecting the position of fiscal participation of the federal government, wishes to reaffirm its belief and position of strong local control, </P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA supports the continuing and expanding participation of the federal government in public education to the point that it does not inherently weaken the position of the local government agency or body.</P>
<P><B>INSERVICE EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that school governments and administrator leadership must be maintained and advanced in a regular program of inservice education in order to insure quality education programs, and</P>
<P>Whereas, such inservice educational programs are an essential district expense that realizes district investments many times over.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA encourages local school boards and superintendents to support and participate in adequate inservice education programs, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that such inservice education programs be an essential district expense.</P>
<P><B>LEGISLATIVE</B></P>
<P>1.Recommendations of WASDA, especially as they pertain to the Legislative Committee, must be structured within a broad statement of political philosophy which will lend a high degree of flexibility to the legislative tasks and processes of the Legislative Committee.</P>
<P>2.The effectiveness of WASDA legislative efforts are in proportion to the number of administrators who actively participate in the political processes at all levels of government.  Progress has been made in that respect, but certainly more administrators must involve themselves if our legislative program is going to grow in quality and strength.</P>
<P>3.Every effort should be made to maintain close working relationships with other administrative organizations. WASDA should as a matter of course invite members of these other organizations to send representatives to legislative meetings in the effort to broaden our base and maximize our efforts.</P>
<P>Further, a similar type of relationship or workable alternative should exist between the WASDA legislative committee and the other working committees of WASDA as the business of such committees and their recommendations would impact upon legislative matters.</P>
<P>4.We support the philosophy that the Department of Public Instruction retain its allocation and utilization of state funding in the operation and implementation of its service responsibilities to the 400 plus school districts in the state. Also, that all federal funds coming into the state of Wisconsin relating to elementary and secondary education be processed through the Department of Public Instruction.</P>
<P>PLATFORM - LOCAL CONTROL</P>
<P>The Legislative Committee of WASDA rejects any charge that local control of public school education is a &quot;myth&quot; or that such local control has outlived its usefulness.</P>
<P>We believe that little evidence exists which supports any contention that, within our political system, levels of government above the local level produce more rational or better decisions concerning public education.</P>
<P>We believe that intelligent decision-making on all levels of government is dependent upon the capacities, values and interests of the decision-makers involved.  It is at the local level where responsive publics can be directly involved in the decision-making process of public school education, and because of the proximity of such publics at the local level, we believe that the public does and can make rational capable decisions concerning the quality of the educational programs it desires in its local school districts.</P>
<P>Therefore, the Legislative Committee of WASDA reaffirms local control of public school education, as constitutionally mandated from the state to local school districts and boards of education, firmly believing that local control of public education can most successfully translate the informed public will into effective policies for public school educational programs.</P>
<P>PLATFORM - POLITICAL PROCESS</P>
<P>The Legislative Committee of WASDA believes that the political process is a dynamic process which is constantly changing and which involves a high degree of personal interrelationships, accurate knowledge and ability to perceive the &quot;real&quot; issues and motivations underpinning all legislation and legislating.  Thus, it is axiomatic that those individuals entrusted with the task of executing a legislative program for the association must have the flexibility to act in good judgment and to effectuate compromise in all matters pertaining to legislation, irrespective of specific platform statements of the association.</P>
<P>PLATFORM - GOALS FOR STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS</P>
<P>1.State general aid for public elementary and secondary schools be funded at a level of 65 percent of total costs.</P>
<P>2.Total principal and interest costs of buildings and the costs of capital outlay be part of shared costs in the school aid formula.</P>
<P>3.For calculating primary aids in the formula, the highest level of state aid would be computed on the part of the districts shared costs which does not exceed 115 percent of the previous year's  statewide average shared cost which exceed 115 percent will be funded by secondary aid.</P>
<P>4.Categorical aids at a level of 70 percent be retained for support of Chapter 115 programs, and a level of 70 percent support be implemented for social workers, nurses and psychologists.l</P>
<P>5.Support the proration of state aids in emergencies and strikes.</P>
<P>6.The 115 percent primary ceiling serves as an adequate cost control of school expenditures on the local level. Expenditures exceeding such level must reside in the decision-making authority of local boards of education.</P>
<P>7.Support existing state categorical aids to public elementary and secondary schools and such aids should be adjusted upward in conjunction with increased costs due to inflation.</P>
<P>8.Biennial appropriations be maintained for financing the operations of the Department of Public Instruction and state financial aid to local school districts.</P>
<P>9.Any state legislative mandated programs to public schools, after consultation and input from the appropriate educational organizations must be funded accordingly by increases in state financial support for the operations of such programs.</P>
<P><B>LIAISON WITH STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION</B></P>
<P>The Executive Committee, by direction from the Board of Directors, represents the WASDA in all meetings with the Department of Public Instruction.</P>
<P><B>MEETINGS, INSTITUTES AND CONVENTIONS</B></P>
<P><B>HELD DURING SCHOOL TERMS</B></P>
<P>The colleges and universities and the state Department of Public Instruction are requested to limit the number of meetings and conferences called during school time requiring teacher absence from classes.  It is gratifying to know that the State Superintendent is working on the problem--(1) contacts with the chief school administrators are to be made prior to the announcement of meetings, (2) as many meetings as possible will be scheduled during non-school hours, (3) the number of meetings will be kept at a reasonable level.</P>
<P><B>MEMBERSHIP PERSONAL SERVICE</B></P>
<P>INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES:</P>
<P>In the event a full voting member, in good standing, needs assistance from the WASDA in his/her relations with the school board, that steps to be taken to secure such assistance be as follows:</P>
<P>1.If the district administrator wishes to obtain legal counsel, the administrator shall contact the Executive Director of the WASDA or, if the Executive Director is not available, the chairman of the School Administrator-School board Relations Committee.</P>
<P> A.Upon proper authorization legal counsel will be provided the member requesting legal assistance.</P>
<P> B.Upon authorization by the WASDA Executive Director the member requesting legal services shall be authorized to expend up to $700 in defense of his/her position or contract language.</P>
<P>C.Financial assistance beyond the $700 must have the approval of the WASDA Board of Directors or the Chairperson of the WASDA Administrator-Board Relations Committee in order to be authorized for payment by the WASDA Executive Director.  If a member incurs legal costs beyond the initial $700, the individual can make application for up to an additional $500 grant in matching funds.  Thus, for a WASDA member to receive up to a $500 additional grant from the Executive Committee, the member would have to show legal fees up to an additional maximum of $1,000 beyond the initial $700 grant.  For example:  A member incurring $950 of authorized legal costs would receive a $825 grant ($700 + $125 matching funds.)</P>
<P> D.The WASDA Board of Directors may request a status report and recommendation relating to the case involved prior to taking official action on a request for the additional financial assistance.</P>
<P>2.Should an administrator desire a fact finding investigation, the administrator shall contact the Executive Director ofthe WASDA or the Chairman of the WASDA Administrator-School Board Relations Committee.  Such investigation, to be effective, should have the approval of the respective school board.  In general, the investigating team shall be composed of the Executive Director of the WASDA, the Executive Director of the WASB, two members of the WASDA Administrator-School Board Relations Committee and two members of the WASB.  The findings of said investigative team shall be confidential information reserved to the respective administrator and the board of education.</P>
<P>GUIDELINES FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN CONDUCTING FACT FINDING INVESTIGATIONS:</P>
<P>1.The School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee will conduct an investigation only when a written request is received as outlined in the Investigation Procedures.</P>
<P>2.The School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee members will conduct a fact finding investigation only when such investigation is authorized and directed by the Chairman of the School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee. </P>
<P>3.WASDA and its School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee shall always act in a highly professional manner when participating in any requested investigation.</P>
<P>4.Identification of areas of conflict and reasons for local actions taken shall be of major concern to the WASDA committee.</P>
<P>5.The committee shall always keep in mind that a school's only reason for being is to serve the children of the community and any recommendations should in no way jeopardize this function.</P>
<P>6.One of the aims of the committee should be to provide help and understanding, not only for the administrator, but, the school board and community as well.</P>
<P>7.The investigation should be impartial in seeking out the truth and members of the committee should not get involved in any discussion of their own ideas and convictions about the particular situation.</P>
<P><B>MILWAUKEE-MILWAUKEE SUBURBAN DESEGREGATION POLICY</B></P>
<P>Be it resolved that the WASDA go on record as favoring improvements of the present Chapter 220 program for the purpose of voluntarily increasing the racial balance of schools and expanding the educational opportunity for all students; further, that WASDA oppose mandated school district reorganization.</P>
<P><B>MINORITY ADMINISTRATORS</B></P>
<P>WASDA shall in its own operations and through its assistance urge local, state and national educational organizations to:</P>
<P>1.establish and carry out effective programs which lead to the recruitment and appointment of minorities to leadership positions.</P>
<P>2.involve all minorities in all leadership training opportunities, both as participants and leaders.</P>
<P>3.involve minorities at all levels of decision making.</P>
<P>4.involve minority administrators in the total socio/political processes of the community.</P>
<P>5.provide for career progression in leadership positions.</P>
<P><B>MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS</B></P>
<P>Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly adopt the concept that all members of the administrative team shall be provided with multi-year contracts and that the members of the WASDA shall actively pursue and recommend to their boards of education multi-year contracts for all administrative team members.</P>
<P><B>POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, it is the policy of WASDA to promote strong public education in Wisconsin's elementary and secondary schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the strength and viability of public education is dependent upon political process and especially by the enactments of the legislative branch of the state of Wisconsin, and</P>
<P>Whereas, it is deemed to be in the best interest of public elementary and secondary education if the WASDA organization would contribute to the elective process and the information available to voters by endorsing candidates for certain political offices.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA Board of Directors shall develop procedures for political endorsement* by the WASDA organization which will allow for the statewide participation of the membership in the endorsement process, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the offices to be included in this procedure be Governor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Representative, and State Senator, and</P>
<P>Criteria for endorsement shall be as follows:</P>
<P>GOVERNOR</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators will endorse a candidate for the elected office of Governor of the state of Wisconsin as follows:</P>
<P>1.Within two weeks after the date of July 12, the WASDA Political Endorsement Committee will meet.  This committee will consist of the following people:  the WASDA President, the Past President, the President-elect, the WASDA Legislative Committee Chairperson, the Legislative Committee Vice Chairperson and the Executive Director of the WASDA.  The purpose of this meeting is to make the plans for the endorsement.  Items to consider will be:  endorsement if there is a primary election, dates for future meetings, development of the list of questions that will be asked of the candidates relative to the issues at the time, development of a timetable for endorsement procedures, etc.</P>
<P>2.Prior to the election, the candidates will be sent a list of questions asking for their positions on the various issues which are of concern to WASDA and its members.</P>
<P>3.Prior to the final endorsement, the Endorsement Committee will meet with the candidates to discuss with them their responses to the list of questions sent to them.  In addition, the committee will attempt to secure commitments from the candidates on various issues in return for our endorsement.</P>
<P>4.The Endorsement Committee will then meet to select the candidate which they will recommend for our endorsement. This candidate's name will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their final approval.</P>
<P>STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators will endorse a candidate for the elected office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction as follows:</P>
<P>1.Within two weeks after the first Tuesday of January, the WASDA Political Endorsement Committee will meet.  This committee will consist of the following people:  The WASDA President, the Past President, the President-elect, the WASDA Legislative Committee Chairperson, the Legislative Committee Vice Chairperson and the Executive Director of the WASDA.  The purpose of this meeting is to make the plans for the endorsement.</P>
<P>Items to consider will be:  endorsement if there is a primary election, dates for future meetings, development of the list of questions that will be asked of the candidates relative to the issues at the time, development of a timetable for endorsement procedures, etc.</P>
<P>2.Prior to the election, the candidates will be sent a list of questions asking for their positions on the various issues which are of concern to WASDA and its members.</P>
<P>3.Prior to the final endorsement, the Endorsement Committee will meet with the candidates to discuss with them their responses to the list of questions sent to them.  In addition, the committee will attempt to secure commitments from the candidates on various issues in return for our endorsement.</P>
<P>4.The Endorsement Committee will then meet to select the candidate which they will recommend for our endorsement. This candidate's name will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their final approval.</P>
<P>WASDA STATE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT PROCEDURES</P>
<P>1.A political coordinator will be selected for each of the 33 Senatorial districts.</P>
<P>2.The political coordinator shall be a member of either the WASDA Legislative Committee or the WASDA AIL-PAC committee.</P>
<P>3.A member of either the WASDA Legislative Committee or a member of the WASDA AIL-PAC shall be appointed to serve as the chairperson for each of the 99 Assembly districts.</P>
<P>4.It will be the responsibility of the political coordinator of the Senatorial districts to promote and coordinate the activities and political involvement of the three chairpersons appointed to the Assembly districts within the Senatorial district.</P>
<P>5.The political coordinator and the chairperson for each Assembly district retain the option of selecting additional members of the WASDA to serve on their Political Endorsement Committee.</P>
<P>6.The political coordinator and the chairpersons of the 99 Assembly districts retain the authority to determine if it would be advisable for the WASDA members within that political boundary area to endorse any of the candidates seeking a state office.</P>
<P>7.If the political coordinators and the chairpersons of the 99 Assembly districts determine that an endorsement would be to the advantage of the WASDA, this determination would be made strictly by the members of the WASDA within that Senatorial district or by the members of the WASDA within a specific Assembly district.</P>
<P>8.If and when a political endorsement for either a state Senator or a state Representative is made, the chairperson should notify the WASDA office.  The WASDA office would then notify the candidate about the endorsement and authorize the candidate to use the name of the WASDA in his/her political campaigns, if he/she desires to do so.</P>
<P>9.The above procedure provides local authorization for an endorsement without requiring further endorsement by the WASDA Legislative Committee or the WASDA AIL-PAC, or official confirmation by the WASDA Board of Directors.</P>
<P>    10.It is also recommended that each candidate considered for endorsement be interviewed by members of the WASDA prior to official endorsement.</P>
<P>11.It is recommended that each candidate considered for endorsement be interviewed by members of the WASDA prior to official endorsement.</P>
<P>    12.Members of the WASDA are encouraged to endorse candidates that they believe will prove to be strong supporters of public elementary and secondary education in Wisconsin, rather than selecting candidates because of personal political affiliations.</P>
<P>Members of the WASDA are reminded that each of the 99 Assembly seats are up for election every two years.  One-half of the 33 Senate seats are up for election every two years.  Thus, of the 33 Senatorial districts, there will only be 16 or 17 racesevery two years.  In other words, the state Representatives are elected for two-year terms, while our state Senators are elected for four-year terms.</P>
<P><B>PROFESSIONAL GROWTH</B></P>
<P>Because the responsibilities of the superintendency are becoming increasingly complex, and because the development of management skills of highly motivated school executives will increase their ability to lead their districts in the fast changing arena of public education, the WASDA is encouraged to pursue a training program which will deliver growth opportunities in ways which will make them both accessible and valuable to practicing superintendents.</P>
<P><B>PROFESSIONAL NEGOTIATIONS</B></P>
<P>The chief school district administrator shall serve as the coordinator of the procedures and responsibilities relating to the union/management collective bargaining process.  The position of the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators should, therefore, support the active role of the superintendent of schools in the professional negotiations process and recommend that the superintendent exert the necessary professional leadership for the representatives serving on the board of education collective bargaining team.  The basic obligation of the chief school district administrator should be to serve the best interests of the pupil.</P>
<P><B>PUBLIC FUNDS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS</B></P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators recognizes and supports the need for diversity of educational opportunity for Wisconsin children.  The association further recognizes the depth of the challenge it faces in obtaining funds in sufficient amounts to properly support existing and planned quality educational programs in the public school system.</P>
<P>Therefore, the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators opposes direct financial aid from state and federal sources to schools which are private and/or sectarian in nature.  We believe that financial support for non-public institutions would weaken the fabric of public education and would tend towards increasing rather than minimizing the divisiveness characterizing our society.</P>
<P>Certain categorical aids are presently available to non-public school children.  The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators feels that to exceed these limited and publicly supervised aids is to extend financial support to the maintenance of the systems themselves.  The association supports the contention that public funds can best be expended to broaden and strengthen public school programs.</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators remains strongly opposed to the voucher system as presently proposed and reaffirms the necessity for working vigorously for the best educational opportunities within the context of the existing public school system.  Also, the WASDA strongly opposes the enactment of tuition tax credits for students attending parochial and private schools as advocated by the federal government.</P>
<P><B>PUBLIC GROUPS AND EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA believes that chief school district administrators should provide leadership in working with and supporting all groups whose purpose is to provide the best educational opportunities for children.  The association encourages its leadership to become actively involved in and cooperate in the efforts being extended by such consortiums as the Wisconsin Council of School Administrative Associations (WCSAA), the Wisconsin Council for United Action in Public Education in Wisconsin, and the Joint Committee on Education in Wisconsin.</P>
<P><B>RESEARCH</B></P>
<P>We believe that WASDA has a key role in identifying needed educational research.  In order to carry out this role effectively there must be a continuous and systematic means of communicating and making joint research decisions between and among the WASDA membership, the Department of Public Instruction, the University System and the WASDA Research Committee. Furthermore, there must be some assurance that recommendations emerging via these shared decision making processes reach the state of priority implementation in a timely manner.</P>
<P>The WASDA membership requests an active/involved role in the annual DPI Superintendent's Fall Conference.  The forumprovided therein should be used to initiate the shared decision making process and to draw upon the insights of the State's District Administrators to identify and promote needed research.  This input would then be used in further discussions with the University System, the DPI and the WASDA Research Committee in supporting the implementation of the decided upon research.</P>
<P>The WASDA membership urges a high priority be placed on soliciting and implementing a cooperative approach to research relevant to the superintendency.  We believe that the WASDA Board of Directors should be authorized and empowered to release funds in amounts commensurate with the value of the research effort to the organization and that timelines should be established to receive the research results within the year the data was compiled.</P>
<P>We further believe that:</P>
<P>1.Critical administrative decisions must be based upon the findings of carefully designed, validated and relevant studies which have particular significance to an application at the local level.</P>
<P>2.The University System and the DPI have access to data which must be analyzed, interpreted and communicated to administrators in a coordinated manner.</P>
<P>3.Administrators need a coordinated support system in being able to gain access and use research data, particularly as it relates to the performance of students beyond high school.</P>
<P>4.The chief function of the Research Committee is to provide a standing committee to meet with and advise those individuals, institutions and/or agencies having the responsibility for the initiation of research studies having particular relevance to the administration of public education.</P>
<P>5.Secure help of research groups who have the expertise and technology to analyze data.</P>
<P>6.Coordinate the research efforts emanating from the various WASDA committees.</P>
<P><B>RETIREMENT</B></P>
<P>WASDA would support legislation which would merge the State Retirement System of Wisconsin; allow for full retirement after age 60; and the development of a factor which would take into account a cost of living index.</P>
<P>Whereas, an effective and strong retirement is important to the well-being and career planning of the school district administrator, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the district administrator's position is basically a twelve-month position as compared to a regular teacher's position of nine months, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the position is one of high stress due to the responsibilities it involves, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the Wisconsin retirement system affecting administrators undergoes periodic reviews and changes, and</P>
<P>Whereas, many states include a provision for vesting the retirement account at a stage it is encouraged that the state of Wisconsin revise its vesting procedures to five years.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA support legislation that would eliminate the present penalty for early retirement of district administrators by including them in the same or similar group as protective occupations, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA Retirement Committee, with the support of the Executive Director, be empowered to support or oppose bills related to a change(s) when there is insufficient time to gain Board and/or membership support, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved the WASDA support efforts to establish a reciprocal retirement system between neighboring/midwest states, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that should an administrator terminate his/her administrative career for retirement or other purposes, that said administrator would have the option to draw out both the employee and employer retirement funds and its corresponding interest or dividends earned during the period said funds are in the retirement fund, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA promote and provide more information than presently exists on the retirement programs through better informational publications and continue to provide informational meetings for administrators on this subject, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved the WASDA encourage its members to become more fully aware of the provisions of the retirement program.</P>
<P>Be it also resolved that WASDA supports the policy that the State Investment Board shall be prudent in all its future investments of Wisconsin Retirement System Funds with due regard for human rights and the protection of the world environment.  WASDA further recommends that all Wisconsin Retirement System funds be retained for retirement purposes.</P>
<P><B>RIF PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly endorse the concept that each school district board adopt a policy regarding a lay-off procedure for the administrative team members that would be necessitated as a result of a substantial decline in the pupil population of the school district.  The school district administrator shall take the initiative to review existing RIF policies with the administrative team members and will actively pursue adoption of an RIF policy by board action.</P>
<P><B>SCHOOL DESEGREGATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that each child shall have an equal opportunity for education that reflects America's pluralistic society, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that school district administrators have a moral and legal obligation to provide leadership to ensure equal opportunity for education.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA support the concept of encouraging districts to voluntarily participate in desegregation efforts and that school district administrators provide affirmative leadership to prevent discriminative or reverse discrimination in any desegregation efforts.</P>
<P> <B>SCHOOL FUNDING</B></P>
<P>WHEREAS alternative methods of funding the public schools of the State of Wisconsin are being considered by the Governor's Commission on Education in the 21st Century; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS there is public outcry regarding the current level of property taxes having to support an inordinate portion of school costs; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS any change in the tax structure for the support of public education should provide for equal tax for equal cost per pupil and to ensure equal educational opportunity for all the students of the State without district islands of tax overburden; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS legislators are seeking fair and effective cost containment techniques to be used for limiting imprudent educational expenditures;</P>
<P>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT:</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators make a strong recommendation to the School Finance Subcommittee of the Governor's Commission on Education to include in their recommendations retention of the equalization aid formula as the primary distributor of state school aids, which can most equitably affect the goal of property tax relief, while ensuring equal educational opportunity for all the children of the State and at the same time offering opportunity for local effort and invoking cost containment through the spending disincentive of secondary shared costs.</P>
<P><B>STATE SUPERINTENDENT</B></P>
<P>In view of the important role of educational leadership served by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, WASDA strongly believes that the requirements of training, experience and certification in the field of school administration be retained.</P>
<P>We also propose that WASDA as an organization take an active role in the selection, support and election of the best possible candidate for state superintendency as determined by a WASDA selection committee.</P>
<P><B>SUMMER SCHOOL</B></P>
<P>Sixty-five percent or more of Wisconsin public school salary schedules require attendance at summer school or other additional training at specified intervals.  In addition, another ten percent encourage such training.</P>
<P>Although many of our institutions of higher learning are providing workshops, the selection of courses is limited.  Therefore, to meet the required salary schedules, teachers are asking for four-week summer sessions.  Universities and colleges should consider offering two four-week summer sessions per summer in addition to the usual eight-week sessions.  It would then be possible for teachers to enroll in a four-week session or to continue for eight weeks of summer work.  This would give the teachers an opportunity to continue with the formal training and would also help alleviate the strain on teachers.</P>
<P>School administrators are also looking for ways to further their education in administration.  Summer school sessions of eight weeks duration make it impossible for administrators to attend summer school unless they are released from duty or are within commuting distance.  Workshops of one to two weeks would give administrators an opportunity to attend sessions and not interfere with their summer work.</P>
<P>It is recommended that institutions of higher learning survey communities to determine the areas of interest to superintendents and that one- to two-week workshops be provided for them.</P>
<P><B>TAX EXEMPTION</B></P>
<P>Any legislation designed to grant special and specific exemptions should make provisions to compensate school districts, in a fair and equitable manner, for the loss of the financial resources previously realized from the property exempted.</P>
<P><B>POSITION ON TAX WITHHOLDING</B></P>
<P>One of the primary responsibilities of the public elementary and secondary schools of this state is the development of and training for responsible citizen participation in the democratic process.  The recent phenomenon of citizen actions directed toward the withholding of that portion of their property taxes which supports local school programs must be viewed with great concern.  Such efforts by municipal officers are not only clearly illegal but can very well be counterproductive if the participants in such actions are sincerely committed to both good education and effective tax reform.</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly opposes such tax withholding actions.  The association continues to urge and will lend its full support to responsible efforts to bring about a comprehensive and meaningful revision of the program of financing elementary and secondary education.  Our longstanding position before the state legislature regarding both the improvement of the school aids formula and the reduction of local property taxes is well established; however, we stand firmly committed to the principle that effective and lasting change in a democracy must be accomplished though utilization of appropriate and existing legal channels.</P>
<P><B>TAXES</B></P>
<P>WASDA reaffirms its position that increased state aids for schools are both a necessity to alleviate soaring property taxes and to tap a broader tax base for the financial support of public education.</P>
<P>WASDA supports the economic principles of a plan which seeks to utilize broader tax sources for the support of public education.</P>
<P>WASDA will support obtaining revenue from higher income tax, extended sales tax, increased sales tax, and new taxesrecommended by our state economics.</P>
<P>WASDA supports legislation to refund the 4 percent sales tax on school building construction to help reduce this cost.</P>
<P><B>TEACHER CERTIFICATION</B></P>
<P>Support the position that retains teacher certification authority and administration in the Department of Public Instruction and support legislation that recognizes competency as a basis for initial certification, and in-service as a requirement for continued certification.</P>
<P><B>TEACHER PREPARATION</B></P>
<P>A.All public schools should participate in teacher preparation by:  (1) providing opportunities for student teaching, and; (2) cooperating with college and university officials in strengthening and upgrading field experiences for all students of education.</P>
<P>B.There should be close liaison with the state Department of Public Instruction and the Deans of Schools of Education in an effort to keep those concerned apprised of specific problem areas for administrators in teacher training programs, internship programs, teacher placement, and teacher certification and to work cooperatively towards solutions.</P>
<P>C.WASDA supports the maintenance of systems that will protect the continued use of confidential credentials and recommendations.</P>
<P>D.WASDA affirms the obligation and right of school administrators to evaluate the performance of teachers and to make, in strict confidence, professional recommendations regarding that performance and that WASDA provide legal aid in defense of any member facing legal action resulting from professional recommendations made in confidence and in good faith.</P>
<P>E.Employment and placement agencies should be notified of WASDA's desire to participate in decision making involving significant modifications in confidential record forms and credential packets and in the manner in which such information is disseminated.</P>
<P><B>TENURE</B></P>
<P>The WASDA continues to hold the position that a teacher tenure law is not beneficial to elementary and secondary education programs in Wisconsin.</P>
<P>WASDA reaffirms its position that the Fair Dismissal Act provides sufficient safeguards for the professional employees and thus, the WASDA stands opposed to tenure for teachers.</P>
<P><B>TUITION TAX CREDITS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, there are significant political proponents for legislating tuition tax credits, and</P>
<P>Whereas, this could have significant impact on public schools by decreasing available financial resources for said schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, this could place unequal responsibilities for providing mandated high cost programs not required of private schools receiving said tax support, and</P>
<P>Whereas, private schools have no requirements to meet minimum educational standards.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA and its members oppose any legislation in part or whole which would ultimately grant tuition tax credits for attendance at private schools or facsimiles thereof.</P>
<P><B>TRANSPORTATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA should propose and/or support legislation requiring local school districts to provide and finance transportation of children to only private schools which are located within the boundaries of the school district.</P>
<P>WASDA should support legislation which would recognize the actual and total distances involved in public school transportation.</P>
<P><B>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, the WASDA reaffirms its support of the importance of a strong vocational component within the context of a comprehensive secondary school and K-12 districts, and</P>
<P>Whereas, a close working relationship be supported between local school districts and the Vocational, Technical and Adult Education schools, and </P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA will support career education programs beginning in the elementary grades and continuing through adulthood, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA reaffirms its support for youth groups and clubs and other special projects relating to vocational education in the secondary schools of Wisconsin, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA strongly supports the efforts of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) in promoting vocational education in the local school districts, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA will support the idea that the primary place for the &quot;training&quot; component of the Jobs Training Partnership Act to occur is the comprehensive high school setting, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA will support cooperative business, industry--school projects that enhance vocational training and opportunities for young people.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA supports that study and possible development of a two-way communication system throughout our state of instructional and in-service purposes, and</P>
<P>Further be it resolved that WASDA should remain alert to the possibilities offered within the structure of the newly reorganized Cooperative Educational Service Agencies and the impact they may have on vocational education.</P>
<P><B>VOCATIONAL - TECHNICAL EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>The 60/40 split of federal funding for vocational education in the state of Wisconsin be reevaluated in the light that allowances be made for the age of students served and proportionate populations served.</P>
<P>A continued effort be made and that additional clarification be made between secondary schools and VTAE schools in the state of Wisconsin.</P>
<P>Efforts be continued to work toward articulation of secondary and post-secondary vocational and technical education programs.</P>
<P>Additional state funds be appropriated to support vocational education programs at the secondary level.</P>
<P>That programs in career education beginning with kindergarten through adulthood be established and developed throughout the state of Wisconsin.</P>
<P>Employment services for students and high school graduates should be established in the secondary schools of Wisconsin.</P>
<P>That participation in youth groups relating to vocational education be supported in local comprehensive high schools.</P>
<P>That health occupations in the comprehensive high school in Wisconsin be developed and stimulated.</P>
<P>That work-study programs for fourteen- and fifteen-year-old students be investigated.</P>
<P>That the 1020 committee, which will be given the authority to determine the use of federal funds as defined in Title X of the 1972 Amendments to Education, be housed with the Wisconsin Board of Vocational, Technical and Adult Education.</P>
<P>The WASDA establish liaison with the University of Wisconsin's Career Center for Studies in Vocational and Technical Education, which will be sponsoring a career education in-service project for administrators.  And further, that administrators be encouraged to participate in this in-service project.</P>
<P>Presently vocational-technical education is allowed to levy up to two mills on local property taxes.  WASDA supports the concept that vocational-technical education be supported by state and federal general revenues and by student fees.</P>
<P>That certification standards for instructors in the area of vocational education be reviewed and revised as they pertain to general methods and criteria, local school input, competency and problems relating to unique skills.</P>
<P>That the Department of Public Instruction, the DILHR and local school districts continuously review and update standards and policies relating to the cooperative study, work study and on-the-job training programs in secondary schools.</P>
<P>That the WASDA promote through local districts and other related agencies a uniform definition of terms so students, parents and the general public can better know and understand the efforts of vocational education in secondary schools.</P>
<P>That WASDA promote through local districts and other related agencies a renewed effort vocational curriculums, the values of the work ethic and the importance of attitude in the world of work.</P>
<P><B>VOUCHER PLANS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, voucher plans, or similar proposals, are presented for legislative consideration, and</P>
<P>Whereas, said plans could interfere with a school district's ability to operate with consistency of enrollment and financial support due to potential competition from other schools, both public and private, and</P>
<P>Whereas, schools already having strong programs with adequate financial support would in all probability receive more financial support from the voucher plan, while schools needing said support to build up their programs would receive less support, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the voucher plan would have many of the similar detrimental effects upon public schools as would the tuition tax credit plan.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA formally opposes legislation which would support this concept.</P>
<P><B>WOMEN ADMINISTRATORS</B></P>
<P>WASDA, in its own operation and through its assistance urge local school districts, and in the work with other educational organizations at the local, state and national levels shall:</P>
<P>1.Strive to insure that women have equal access to educational administrative positions.</P>
<P>2.Establish and carry out effective programs which lead to the recruitment and appointment of women to leadership positions.</P>
<P>3.Initiate support for and participate in training activities directed at assisting women to advance professionally.</P>
<P>4.Involve women in all leadership training opportunities, both as participants and leaders.</P>
<P>5.Involve women at all levels of decision making.</P>
<P>6.Involve women administrators in the total socio-political processes of the community.</P>
<P>7.Provide for career progression in leadership positions.</P>
<P>8.Promote the status and visibility of women in educational administration.</P>
<P>9.Publish dates and share information related to the employment and utilization of qualified women in educational administration.</P>
<P><B><U>STUDENTS</U></B></P>
<P><B>ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, there is a concern about the number of Wisconsin high school students who drop out prior to graduation, and</P>
<P>Whereas, there are fewer opportunities for unskilled and poorly trained individuals, and</P>
<P>Whereas, unemployable individuals become wards of society, and</P>
<P>Whereas, past and present dropout prevention has not seemed to be effective.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA encourage the development of alternative education programs, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that WASDA take a leadership role in developing joint planning with vocational districts, the CESA organization and other public and private employers.</P>
<P><B>BASIC LANGUAGE</B></P>
<P>Whereas, every strong nation must be able to communicate with its citizens, and</P>
<P>Whereas, in every strong nation the citizens must be able to communicate with each other, and</P>
<P>Whereas, schools are charged with the teaching of the basic language of our society, and </P>
<P>Whereas, English is the basic language of the United States.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA take a stand to encourage the teaching of English rather than teaching in the native language, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that bilingual instruction be transitional in nature.</P>
<P><B>CHEMICAL ABUSE PROGRAMS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, chemical dependency in America is among the highest of any developed country in the world, and</P>
<P>Whereas, a significant number of high school seniors regularly abuse drugs, and</P>
<P>Whereas, roughly 2/3 of all Americans try an illicit drug before they finish high school, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the single leading cause of death among youth is drunk driving.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA support the establishment of chemical abuse programs in every high school in the state of Wisconsin, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that WASDA support a uniform 21-year-old drinking law in the United States.</P>
<P><B>CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</B></P>
<P>Whereas, child abuse and child neglect is a growing problem in the United States, and</P>
<P>Whereas, all school employees are charged with the responsibility of reporting incidents of suspected child abuse and child neglect, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the district administrator is responsible for the supervision of all programs.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the school district administrator will taken an active role in the reporting of suspected cases of child abuse and child neglect, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the district administrator will provide for inservice of employees to assist them in identifying, and how to handle suspected cases of child abuse and child neglect.</P>
<P><B>COMPETENCY TESTING</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA recognizes programs for establishing minimal competencies and basic skills examination for promotion and/or graduation have been instituted by legislative action and by mandates of local school boards, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that such programs should be based upon the acknowledgement that multiple levels of individual differences exist among all students, and</P>
<P>Whereas, such programs should not limit expectations of student performance by establishing single standards of achievement, but should provide assessment including professional judgments of the students' cumulative experiences and acquisition of basic skills consistent with their identified learning abilities.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA believes these programs should reflect concern for student needs beyond expected minimal competencies and should consider their goals beyond high school.</P>
<P><B>COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AGE</B></P>
<P>The WASDA supports State Statutes 118.15(1)(a) which states that unless the child has a legal excuse or has graduated from high school, any person having under control a child who is between the ages of 6 and 18 years shall cause such child to attend school regularly during the full period and hours, religious holidays excepted, that the public or private school in which such child should be enrolled is in session until the end of the school term, quarter or semester of the school year in which the child becomes 18 years of age.</P>
<P><B>CORPORAL PUNISHMENT</B></P>
<P>The WASDA supports 118.31 of the State Statutes, which states, &quot;No official, employe or agent of a school board may subject a pupil enrolled in the school district to corporal punishment.  The team &quot;corporal punishment&quot; means the intentional infliction of physical pain which is used as a means of discipline.  &quot;Corporal punishment&quot; includes, but is not limited to, paddling, slapping or prolonged maintenance of physically painful positions, when used as a means of discipline.  </P>
<P>This section does not prohibit an official employee or agent of a school board from using reasonable and necessary force to quell a disturbance or prevent an act that threatens physical injury to any person, to obtain possession of a weapon, to use self-defense, to protect property, etc.</P>
<P><B>DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, a well-oriented classroom and a well-ordered school best meets the educational needs of all the students enrolled, and</P>
<P>Whereas, young people need rules and regulations, as well as the strong supporting role models of interested teachers, so that discipline can be maintained within the classroom and the school, and</P>
<P>Whereas, our society needs disciplined people to act as responsible adults.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA support efforts at the local level to provide the necessary staffing and programmingto afford assistance to students who need disciplining, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA encourage boards of education and district administrators to in-service teachers and support staff so that there is a consistent pattern of discipline well understood by both faculty and students in both individual classrooms and entire school buildings, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA support efforts by board of education and school administrators to work closely with the home so that discipline can be developed in elementary and secondary school-age students in joint efforts between school and home.</P>
<P><B>DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, disruptive students interfere both with their own learning and with the learning of other students, and</P>
<P>Whereas, disruptive students undermine the positive learning atmosphere of schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, there are many causes for the behavior of disruptive students which can be resolved through appropriate persons and programs.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA supports special counseling and guidance for disruptive students, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA supports special program settings if necessary so that the needs of disruptive students are met while at the same time the needs of all other students are not interfered with, and</P>
<P>Be it finally resolved that disruptive students who continue to disrupt be confronted with consequences appropriate to their continued violations.</P>
<P><B>ENTRANCE AGE</B></P>
<P>WASDA supports the change in the status that brought about a uniform age of September 1 and continues to support the prospect of state aid which would be allocated for such programs starting at age 4 and proportionate to full or half-day programs.</P>
<P><B>GIFTED &amp; TALENTED STUDENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, children are endowed with special gifts and talents; and</P>
<P>Whereas, it is in the best interest of these children, as well as of the community, state and nation, that these special gifts and talents be developed insofar as possible, and</P>
<P>Whereas, these special gifts and talents require special instructional strategies and special curriculum content.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA support the development of appropriate legislation encouraging programming and providing the necessary funding incentives to meet the needs of gifted and talented elementary and secondary school students.</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA encourage school districts to develop programs for their gifted and talented students in recognition of the special potential of these students.</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the state fund a competitive grant program that will adequately fund staff appointments for gifted and talented K-12 programs throughout the state.</P>
<P><B>SPECIAL EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the idea that the State of Wisconsin should provide through its LEA's a strong special educationprogram designed to serve students with exceptional educational needs and designed to meet the requirements and standards set forth by PL 94-142.</P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the idea that current state law and agency rules and regulations respecting special education could be and should be revised so that the special education delivery system would be appropriate to the demographics of Wisconsin and would permit more effective ways to serve students with exceptional needs.</P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the idea that the funding system for special education would benefit from reform and revisions which would place the major burden of support of special education at the state level rather than at the local level and would equitably distribute aid.  WASDA requests the opportunity to participate in any state study groups established to recommend reforms of the special education aid formula.</P>
<P>With respect to these positions WASDA puts forth these considerations:</P>
<P>1.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to promote special education.  At the time PL 94-142 was conceived, Wisconsin was a leader in the delivery of special education services.  WASDA has always supported efforts that Wisconsin be a leader in the area of special education.  WASDA has always supported the idea that school districts must live up to their responsibilities to comply with the letter and the spirit of the laws of the land.</P>
<P>2.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to provide educational services appropriate to the needs and the unique conditions of the state.  At the time PL 94-142 was conceived, Wisconsin in anticipation of the law put together state law and agency rules and regulations which in the implementation have created a delivery system, which in concept not only met, but also exceeded, the letter and spirit of PL 94-142 and in general created for LEA's a cumbersome, cost-ineffective system, which cannot be shown to be appropriate to either the demographics of Wisconsin or for the best interest of students with exceptional educational needs.</P>
<P>3.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to provide sufficient funding to encourage and support special education.  The implementation of the laws and rules and regulations which were laid down in anticipation of PL 94-142 have generated for the state and LEA's tremendous special education costs.  The state is currently moving toward an alternative funding system in the hope of establishing greater equity and greater control of the budgeting and distribution of special education aids.  WASDA feels there is a real peril to LEA's if a substitute formula is adopted which fails to maintain the state's obligation to support the major share of the tremendous direct and indirect costs generated by the state mandated delivery system.</P>
<P><B>IMPROVING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN BASIC ACADEMIC SKILLS</B></P>
<P>As a result of expressed concerns about low student performance in academic skills and in the event of legislative action concerning the teaching of basic skills, the WASDA Committee on Educational Program Evaluation has identified a number of issues and concerns which should be deliberated prior to enactment of any legislation.  The issues included herein are considered by the committee to be important considerations in order to effectively address the problem of improving student achievement in basic skills.  The committee defines basic skill instruction to include reading, writing and arithmetic.</P>
<P>Prior to deliberating any legislative remedy it is critical that specific problems related to basic skills be identified.  If indeed problem(s) are identified and if legislation is deemed desirable, the following stipulations should be observed:</P>
<P>1.It is imperative that legislative remedies be aimed at rectifying specific correctable deficiencies rather than at the broad unspecified area of &quot;basic skills.&quot;</P>
<P>2.It is imperative that legislative remedies include standards of acceptable performance for those basic skills.  These standards would not only apply to students who have been identified as having exceptional education needs.</P>
<P>3.It is imperative that legislation allow local school districts to develop their own educational programs for helpingtheir students reach the stipulated standards.</P>
<P>4.In order to ascertain compliance with the law the legislation should include procedures for reporting achievement in basic skills to the Department of Public Instruction.</P>
<P>5.It is imperative the legislation include a stipulated time period for evaluating the impact of the law on student performance with regard to basic skills at the end of a defined time period.  A sunset provision should be included which would allow for evaluation and termination or modification of the statute.  A reasonable time period might be three to five years.</P>
<P><B>STUDENT RIGHTS</B></P>
<P>Support the position on student rights which states that students have rights, as well as responsibilities, similar to those of all citizens.</P>
<P><B>SUBSTANCE ABUSE</B></P>
<P>WASDA urges administrators to work with other agencies to establish prevention/intervention programs for students affected by alcohol and other substance abuse.</P>
<P><B><U>ORGANIZATION</U></B></P>
<P><B>COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE AGENCIES</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA supports CESAs as a cost effective approach to maintaining and improving quality education in Wisconsinpublic schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, collaborative educational endeavors among school districts, colleges, Vocational Technical Adult Education Districts, universities, business, industry and the state can be facilitated effectively by CESA, and</P>
<P>Whereas, CESAs are designed to coordinate interdistrict programs effectively and efficiently, and</P>
<P>Whereas, there is a growing need for interdistrict collaboration to provide quality education with limited resources.</P>
<P>Now therefore be it resolved that:</P>
<P>WASDA members support CESAs through political action to stabilize state funding for CESAs and that</P>
<P>WASDA assume a leadership role to improve the image of CESAs through public relations efforts and that</P>
<P>WASDA support the state's commitment to strengthening the CESA role in the delivery of educational service to districts, and that</P>
<P>WASDA continue to support its Executive Director's lobbying efforts for CESAs.</P>
<P><B>DPI STAFF</B></P>
<P>Because education is a state function, the DPI must have staff availability for continuing services to local school districts.  A decrease of staff members in an era of increased demands on the schools of Wisconsin would have adverse consequences.</P>
<P><B>PTA</B></P>
<P>Whereas the PTA is the best source to resolve the communication gap regarding school programs, finances and educational needs within the local school district;</P>
<P>And whereas membership by parents in the state affiliated PTA unit has the advantage of resources from the state and national Congress of PTA:</P>
<P>Be it resolved by WASDA to encourage every District Administrator to initiate units of PTA in his/her local district which are affiliated with the Wisconsin Congress of Parents and Teachers.</P>
<P><B>RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS</B></P>
<P>WASDA Policies and Resolutions Committee commends all sincere efforts being made to identify areas of common concern, to clarify points of conflict, and to identify areas of agreement within the teaching profession.</P>
