<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Reform Debate In Full Force In
Canadian Federal Government</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Ottawa, Canada:</b>&nbsp; Debate
over Canada's federal policies regarding both the widespread
cultivation of industrial hemp and the legalization of small
amounts of marijuana for recreational use are currently in full
swing in the Canadian Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hearings have been ongoing regarding the future of proposed
government bill C-8, a measure currently before the Senate that
will effectively replace the Narcotic Control Act with the Controlled
Substances and Abuse Act.&nbsp; Currently, the measure retains
the existing penalties for marijuana: a potential $1,000 fine or
six months in jail.&nbsp; However, a growing group of vocal senators
from both major parties feel that the time for decriminalization
of marijuana has come and the federal law must reflect that. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am in favor of decriminalizing marijuana,&quot; said
Liberal Senator Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, one of five senators who
sit on the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee
who have publicly endorsed decriminalization.&nbsp; &quot;We must
look at this very seriously.&nbsp; The approach we have now is
criminal, it's punitive.&nbsp; Maybe it's a health approach we
should be taking a serious look at.&nbsp; The punitive approach
has not worked and the problem is still there.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Cannabis is much less lethal than cigarettes and
alcohol,&quot; added Quebec Progressive Conservative Senator
Pierre-Claude Nolin.&nbsp; &quot;Are we into prohibition because
it's somewhat of a dogma that we don't question and [because]
everybody else is doing it?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Senators [are] much more interested in a harm reduction
model of drug control in this country than they [are] in a
punishment model,&quot; confirmed Liberal Senator Sharon
Carstairs, Chairwoman for the senate committee.&nbsp; &quot;That
is where almost all of the senators are coming from.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to the growing movement regarding the use of
recreational marijuana, support for policies legalizing the
widescale growing of industrial hemp is also gathering
support.&nbsp; According to a staff-member for Liberal Senator
Lorna Milne, the senator will soon be introducing an amendment to
C-8 that will make it legal to cultivate hemp by adding
&quot;mature hemp stock&quot; to a list of approved
substances.&nbsp; The staffer reports that Milne's office does
not anticipate &quot;any difficulty&quot; regarding the passage
of the amendment and adds that the proposal has the support of
Health Minister David Dingwall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Hemp cultivation] seems to me to be a sensible thing to
do,&quot; Milne said recently. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill C-8 is currently undergoing it's second committee review in
the Senate and the overall bill is expected to be amended and
returned to the House of Commons.&nbsp; Sources who have spoken
to <b>NORML</b> anticipate that any measures regarding hemp
cultivation should pass both the Senate and House without
complications, but warn that proposals regarding the
decriminalization of recreational marijuana will most likely be
opposed by the House. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Black Motorists Subject To Stops And
Searches On I-95 More Often Than Whites</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Perryville, MD:</b>&nbsp; Black
motorists are stopped and searched for drugs at least four times
more often than whites by a special Maryland highway drug unit
that patrols stretches of Interstate 95, according to a recent
report from the <i>Associated Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although state police spokesmen have flatly denied using racial
profiles, findings from an <em>AP</em> computer analysis of car
searches indicate that more than 75 percent of all drivers whose
cars were searched by the special drug squad through the first
nine months of 1995 were black.&nbsp; In all, the Special Traffic
Interdiction Force (STIF), whose six officers are white, searched
145 of the motorists it stopped along a 50 mile stretch of I-95
between the Delaware border and the Baltimore County line; of
these, 110 motorists were listed as black, 24 white, six
Hispanic, and five &quot;other&quot; minorities.&nbsp; Maryland
police maintain that the findings are a coincidence. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Maryland state troopers, like those in many states, are forbidden
to use racial profiles in traffic stops.&nbsp; In addition,
Maryland troopers are mandated to provide records on highway
searches to the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland under
terms of a legal settlement reached in 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to at least one attorney from the ACLU who spoke with
the <em>AP</em>, a future class-action lawsuit may be considered
if the data eventually proves a pattern of discrimination.&nbsp;
At least one private discrimination lawsuit has already been
filed against three STIF troopers. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Repeat Felony Marijuana Possession Penalties
Reduced In Missouri</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp; Thanks
in large part to the efforts of Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan
Viets, Gov. Mel Carnahan signed into law Senate Bill 830 which
significantly reduces the range of punishment for second and
third offense felony marijuana possession. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SB 830 was filed after Viets contacted Sen. Joe Moseley
(D-Columbia) late last year and alerted him that under the
Missouri prior and persistent drug offender statute, an
individual who merely possessed more than one and one quarter
ounces of marijuana on two occasions would be eligible for a
punishment ranging from 10 years to life in prison.&nbsp; One who
had committed three such offenses would be subject to 10 years to
life in prison without the possibility of probation or parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The passage of SB 830 changes the law to specify that simple
marijuana possession offenses will no longer be punishable under
the prior and persistent drug offender statute.&nbsp; Therefore,
a second offense of felony marijuana possession which formerly
had a sentencing range of 10 years to life now has a sentencing
range of zero to seven years.&nbsp; Furthermore, regardless of
how many drug offenses of any nature one has, no simple
possession offense will ever carry a punishment of more than
seven years and the defendant will remain eligible for probation
and parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Senator Moseley ... [is] one of the most effective
advocates for rational reform of the criminal laws generally with
whom I have ever had the privilege of working,&quot; stated
Viets. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Dennis Peron Leaves Cannabis Buyers Club</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 29, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Dennis Peron, founder of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club
-- the nation's largest and most overt supplier of wholesale
marijuana to the seriously ill -- has stepped down from his post
as director.&nbsp; Peron will now concentrate full-time on
passing the California Medical Marijuana Initiative which is
slated for the November ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Taking over for Peron as director of the 10,000 member club is
longtime AIDS and marijuana activist Beth Moore.&nbsp; Moore will
continue to run the club as a not-for-profit organization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I intend to run the Club with as much love as Dennis
founded it,&quot; stated Moore.&nbsp; &quot;I know medical
marijuana is saving lives.&nbsp; It is a moral imperative that
our mission continue.&nbsp; It is with heavy heart that we say
goodbye to Dennis, but we know that we must legalize [cannabis]
and Dennis has been chosen for the task. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I will continue to work for social justice and compassion
for our sick,&quot; said Peron upon his retirement from the
Club.&nbsp; &quot;The initiative is just the first step towards a
more loving and compassionate society.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>City Commission Urges Citizens To Just say
No To NORML Ballot Proposal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 20, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp; The
Traverse City Commission has unanimously passed a resolution
urging city residents to vote against an initiative put forth by
the Traverse City NORML chapter to reduce marijuana
penalties.&nbsp; The measure -- which will appear on the ballot August
6 - seeks to make possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce
of marijuana in Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of
$100 and up to ten hours of community service for a first-time
offender.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the City Commission
unanimously passed a resolution encouraging residents to not sign
the NORML petition. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Bustance, president of the Traverse City NORML chapter,
denounced the Commission's latest action and remarked that it
&quot;discounts the intelligence of the worthy citizens that
signed the petition.&quot;&nbsp; However, Bustance still remains
confident that there is ample voter support for the measure.&nbsp;
&quot;We're not asking: 'Are you for marijuana or are you against
marijuana?' or 'If you're for <b>NORML</b> or against <b>NORML</b>?'
...&nbsp; We're asking: 'Do you want to throw people in prison at
a cost of $30,000 per year or do you want to enact fines and
community service that will go directly to the community?'&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bustance challenged opposing groups to a televised debate. <br>
