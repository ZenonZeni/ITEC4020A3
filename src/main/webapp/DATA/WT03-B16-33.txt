<H2><a name="m&a">MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</a></H2>
<H4>Harmonising Employee Benefits Post-Merger</H4>
<P>Last edition's lead story looked at HR issues before an acquisition; this one considers their role in achieving a successful 
combined organisation post-merger. Creating a harmonised employee benefit package is a necessary step towards integrating 
one of the new organisation's most important assets -- its people. Instead of the traditional approach of ignoring employee 
benefit issues for as long as possible and only considering them in isolation and mainly as a risk management issue, companies 
should take a pro-active approach. The starting point is to identify what the combined organisation is trying to achieve, what is 
required of the employees and how compensation and benefit programmes should support this.</P>
<P>Once the agenda for benefit issues has been defined, it must be driven by the organisation. Otherwise it will be set by the 
piecemeal solutions that are adopted as individual issues arise. The agenda will comprise three elements: benefit objectives, 
benefit principles and gaining acceptance.</P>
<P><STRONG>Benefit objectives.<BR>
</STRONG>The organisation needs to identify and communicate a clear vision of its benefit objectives.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>establishing an employee benefit programme for each operation that is fully aligned with the employment deal offered to 
employees by the combined organisation</LI>
<LI>providing these benefits as efficiently as possible</LI>
<LI>ensuring that employees recognise the value of the benefit programme.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Benefit principles.<BR>
</STRONG>The next step is to develop benefit principles that support these objectives. These can be divided into:</P>
<UL>
<LI>design principles (what the company wants to provide and to whom)</LI>
<LI>delivery principles (how it wants to provide them)</LI>
<LI>governance principles (structurally how benefit issues will be managed within the organisation).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Design principles might set out the organisation's competitive stance on benefits and their position within the total remuneration 
package. Delivery principles might set out a common financing policy for benefits, including use of multinational pooling. 
Governance principles might set out the extent to which corporate or regional headquarters should be involved in decisions on 
benefit design and delivery issues.</P>
<P>The aim of the design principles is to identify the company's overall attitude to providing employee benefits. The delivery 
principles should identify how the organisation wishes to provide benefits in order to maximise efficiency and limit risk.</P>
<P><STRONG>Gaining acceptance.<BR>
</STRONG>To work effectively, the benefit objectives and principles need to be accepted at several levels:</P>
<UL>
<LI>senior management</LI>
<LI>operations</LI>
<LI>HR as well as benefits</LI>
<LI>finance.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Acceptance is needed both locally and at regional/corporate headquarters. Local acceptance is crucial to successful 
implementation. A key element in achieving success is the role the international benefit manager plays, which has two basic 
elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>setting and monitoring policy</LI>
<LI>communicating with local operations and senior management.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There will undoubtedly be obstacles in the way of achieving the process outlined above. The most common one is a lack of 
time. However, in most cases, some straightforward steps can be taken:</P>
<UL>
<LI>buying sufficient time to set up benefit programmes that are durable</LI>
<LI>identifying those issues that need to be addressed immediately.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There is still a need for the acquiring company to carry out the traditional due diligence process before the acquisition. 
However, the advantage of a clear strategy is that this process becomes much more focused and therefore more efficient.</P>
<P>The ultimate success in mergers and acquisitions comes from having clear, widely accepted benefit objectives and principles, 
and mechanisms to implement them effectively throughout the organisation.</P>

<H4>Coalition Government Proposes Changes To Superannuation</H4>
<P>The new conservative coalition government has re-affirmed its pre-election commitments regarding employer-provided 
retirement incomes, known as superannuation. Although change is certain, there will not be any fundamental shifts in the role 
or operation of corporate superannuation funds.</P>
<P>Employers should ensure that their superannuation planning recognises the potential changes that are expected over the next 
few years.</P>
<P>The government is continuing the mandatory Superannuation Guarantee System requiring minimum employer contributions, 
currently at 6%, but increasing to 9% by 2002. It will also maintain the current tax structure and intends to implement the 
previous government's proposal for mandatory employee contributions to be matched by the government (although the 
delivery mechanism is likely to be different). The match is now likely to be provided as a tax rebate, rather than a direct 
payment to the fund.</P>
<P>The key changes planned by the coalition are the introduction of added flexibility and choice to superannuation in a range of 
areas. The most significant of these are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Individual retirement savings accounts (RSAs) will be introduced by banks and other financial institutions without a 
trustee structure, but will be subject to the same tax treatment as superannuation funds and will be regulated by the 
Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</LI>
<LI>Changes to union-based industrial awards and workplace agreements will provide members with a choice from up to 
five funds (including employer funds, industry funds, personal funds and RSAs).</LI>
<LI>Introduction by the year 2000 of members' rights in defined contribution funds will allow benefits to be moved between 
funds nominated in awards and agreements.</LI>
<LI>Funds will be encouraged to provide member choice, both in investment strategy and in benefit design, by the year 
2000.</LI>
<LI>People earning less than A$900 per month will be allowed to elect additional wages instead of compulsory 
superannuation contributions.</LI>
<LI>Individuals will be allowed an 18% tax rebate for contributions of up to A$3,000 per annum for a spouse earning less 
than A$10,800 per annum.</LI>
<LI>The issue of accessing superannuation moneys by individual members for the purposes of their own housing needs has 
been discussed for some time and may emerge as a government policy in due course; it is likely to be based on 
withdrawal of funds, rather than on the member taking a loan from the retirement fund.</LI>

<H4>Commission Reaffirms Support For Single Market For Pension Funds</H4>
<P>In a speech in Brussels on 18 June, Mario Monti, EU Commissioner for the Internal Market, Financial Services and Taxation, 
stated his intention to create a single market for pension funds, in spite of opposition from member states. He indicated that he 
would be pursuing two distinct, but mutually reinforcing, policies to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>eliminate unjustified investment restrictions</LI>
<LI>widen the debate on pension funds, including cross-border mobility and tax issues.</LI>
</UL>
<P>As part of the policy to eliminate investment restrictions, Mr. Monti is writing to several member states to warn them that they 
are in breach of Treaty provisions against privileged access and discrimination. If their response is unsatisfactory, the matter 
will be referred to the European Court of Justice.</P>
<P>To widen the debate, the Commission is preparing a policy document, to be presented before the end of September this year, 
which will cover a number of pensions issues, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>regulating pensions funds in the EU</LI>
<LI>whether the same rules should apply to both pension funds and life insurance</LI>
<LI>the need for optimal investment of pension fund assets and the role of EU Treaty rules in removing unjustified 
investment restrictions</LI>
<LI>the role of efficient capital markets in maximising pension fund investments</LI>
<LI>cross-border mobility of workers (including those seconded to another member state)</LI>
<LI>the impact of tax on pension funds.</LI>

<H4>New Agreement On Pensions Will Significantly Affect Future Retirement Income</H4>
<P>On 26 April 1996, union and employer representatives reached an agreement to stabilise, at least in the short term, the 
financial situation of the two national mandatory contributory retirement schemes, ARRCO and AGIRC.</P>
<P>Employers who offer supplementary benefit arrangements that are integrated with social security and ARRCO/AGIRC 
benefits should look at the design of these plans and, if necessary, consider changes to protect them against future decreases 
in the ARRCO/AGIRC schemes. For employers who do not offer supplementary plans, now may be a good time to review 
their retirement policies. Employers should also consider the responsibility they want to assume in the retirement planning of 
their employees.</P>
<P>ARRCO and AGIRC are pay-as-you-go national retirement funds that cover, through mandatory employee and employer 
contributions, all salaried employees.</P>
<P>Under these arrangements, retirement points are purchased each year with contributions. These points are accumulated during 
the career of the individual and then converted into pension using a point value at retirement.</P>
<P>As for most pay-as-you-go systems, the unfavourable demographic trends in France are exerting pressure on the financing of 
these arrangements. In France the proportion of retired people to working employees is expected to increase from 33% in 
1996 to 63% in 2040.</P>
<P>It is hoped that the new agreement will ensure the financial equilibrium of the ARRCO/AGIRC schemes until 2005. Future 
negotiations are scheduled in 1999 and 2002 to review the new measures and, if necessary, extend them.</P>
<P>The key measures are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>increase in the minimum ARRCO contribution rate on Tranche B earnings (FF 161,220 - 483,660 in 1996) from 4% in 
1996 to 16% in 2005</LI>
<LI>the increase in the minimum AGIRC contribution rate on Tranche B and C earnings (FF 161,220 - 1,289,760) to 16% 
moved forward to take place in 1999, rather than 2003</LI>
<LI>consolidation of the 45 ARRCO funds under a single unified one as of 1 January 1999</LI>
<LI>a relative annual increase in ARRCO point purchase price</LI>
<LI>a relative annual decrease in ARRCO and AGIRC pension point value.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These last two measures will severely impact the future level of retirement income provided by the ARRCO/AGIRC schemes 
and could reduce the annual pension by up to 20% depending on the employee profile. This could result in significant cost 
increases for employers who guarantee supplementary benefits integrated with those under the mandatory schemes.</P>
<P>The government has promised new legislation in the autumn that would facilitate the accumulation of retirement capital to 
supplement the mandatory schemes. Whether this will translate into improved savings plans or a new fiscal infrastructure for 
retirement funds is yet to be seen. One thing is certain, however: given the trend on the evolution of social security and 
ARRCO/AGIRC benefits, private supplementary pension plans in France will become increasingly important.</P>

<H4>Changes to Disability Insurance Act (WAO) Proposed</H4>
<P>The Ministry of Social Affairs has proposed to Parliament that the Disability Insurance Act be amended. The aim of the 
change is to shift the burden of payment during the first five years from the government to employers by introducing 
differentiated contributions and by giving employers the opportunity to opt-out.</P>
<P>If employers choose opting-out, they will need to take out a contract with a bank or an insurance company covering the risk 
that payments may have to be made. In addition to the differentiated contributions, employers will also have to pay a national 
contribution (basispremie) for existing disabled employees. The act will probably come into force on 1 January 1997.</P>

<H4>Opportunities For Lower Medical Benefit Costs Available</H4>
<P>Developments in the medical benefit market offer the opportunity to lower costs and increase employee satisfaction. There is 
now a wide range of products to meet the diverse requirements of employers and employees. However, careful evaluation of 
employer and employee requirements and the ability of these products to meet them is essential.</P>
<P>Health care costs in South Africa have risen rapidly over the last few years, accounting for as much as 10% to 15% of pay. 
The main reason for these runaway costs is fee-for-service programmes, which tend to give providers incentives to deliver 
more services.</P>
<P>Two new medical benefit products have recently been developed: managed care and savings accounts. Managed care, which 
is the hallmark of medical benefit programmes in the United States, introduces information systems, quality controls and 
negotiated prices into the delivery of health care. Managed care benefits use contracted 'networks' of providers that agree to 
follow medical protocols and accept pre-determined prices for their services. Major insurers and other parties in South Africa 
have invested hundreds of millions of rand in building managed care systems to lower costs and improve quality.</P>
<P>Savings account products, also called 'new generation' schemes, combine insurance for hospital costs with an 
employee-funded account for 'controllable' day-to-day expenses such as doctor visits and medicines.</P>
<P>These products give employees a strong incentive to control costs because any unused savings are refunded or carried over to 
the next year. At the same time, employees carry the financial risk for the cost of health care, which can exceed their savings if 
serious illness occurs.</P>

<H4>Mandatory National Health Insurance</H4>
<P>Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) was established as of March 1995 to address the flaws of the previous health care 
system: primarily inadequate funding, administrative inefficiency, insufficient controls over cost and utilisation, and an uninsured 
population of 40%.</P>
<P>All citizens are now required to enroll in NHI; foreign employees are eligible to enroll on a voluntary basis.</P>
<P>NHI is financed by employers, insured members and the government. The contributions are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>4.25% x contribution rate x member's family size x covered earnings</LI>
<LI>the contribution rate is 60%, 30% and 10% for employers, members and the government, respectively.</LI>
</UL>
<P>NHI provides comprehensive health care; coverage includes inpatient and outpatient treatment, dental care, Chinese herbal 
medicines, prescription drugs, preventive care, prenatal care, etc. Additionally, insured members have free choice of doctor 
and hospital.</P>
<P>The cost and utilisation controls are achieved by requiring the patient to follow a prescribed treatment path. For example, 
patients are subject to higher co-payments if receiving treatment without proper referral. NHI uses a fee schedule and per 
capita charges to control cost and utilisation escalation.</P>
<P>As in other countries, the new system is in a state of flux as it balances the diverse needs of people. However, the Taiwanese 
government is committed to achieving its goal of 'health for all in Taiwan' by the year 2000.</P>

<H4>MFR Regulations And Guidance Issued</H4>
<P>The Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) regulations have been finalised and laid before Parliament. They will come into 
force on 6 April 1997. In addition, an actuarial guidance note (GN27) that details how to perform the MFR calculations has 
been published.</P>
<P>The MFR applies to all UK occupational pension schemes except defined contribution schemes, non-tax approved schemes 
and certain statutory schemes. Trustees of occupational pension schemes are required to obtain MFR valuations including 
certification of the funding level (ratio of scheme assets to MFR liabilities) and certification that the contributions payable by 
the employer are sufficient to maintain, or achieve within a specified period of time, a 100% MFR funding level.</P>
<P>The first MFR valuation must have an effective date of not more than three years after the last pre-6 April 1997 formal 
valuation. It must then be renewed, in the normal course of events, at three-year intervals. In practice, MFR valuations are 
likely to follow the normal valuation cycle.</P>

<P><a name="uk2"><STRONG>Labour Party Issues Retirement Paper</STRONG></a></P>
<P>A general election is due in the United Kingdom before May 1997. In preparing its election manifesto, the Labour Party has 
issued a paper on its policies for future retirement provision in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The major issues raised by the paper are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>State benefits will remain largely in their current form. Recent reductions to State benefits would not be reversed and no 
one-off increases to these benefit would be awarded (as per previous Labour Party policy).</LI>
<LI>Occupational pension scheme rules would remain largely unchanged, although the requirements to provide information 
about benefits may increase. In addition, member involvement in the running of schemes could increase, and the 
Minimum Funding Requirement may be made more stringent.</LI>
<LI>Low-cost simple multi-employer pension arrangements would be encouraged to cater for individuals who currently 
have no pension arrangements.</LI>
<LI>A new individual savings account would be introduced allowing individuals to save for the long-term, but with fewer 
restrictions than current pension arrangements. For example, funds in the account could be used to finance mid-career 
re-training.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In a separate move, Frank Field, a Labour MP with a keen interest in social security issues, introduced a Bill in the House of 
Commons that would establish a savings vehicle similar to a 401(k) plan in the United States. Although this Bill is unlikely to 
become law, it is similar to the individual savings accounts proposed by Labour and indicative of the support for this sort of 
arrangement within the Labour Party.</P>

<H4>Study Finds Closer Link Between CEO Pay And Performance</H4>
<P>The link between chief executives' compensation and their performance grew even closer last year in major US companies, 
according to Towers Perrin's latest annual study of CEO pay practices. Indeed, performance-based annual and long-term 
incentives now account for about two-thirds of the total CEO pay package on average among the 250 large companies 
included in the study.</P>
<P>Another clear indication of chief executives' growing stake in their organisations' performance is the rising level of CEOs' 
shareholdings in their companies. Among the companies in our analysis, CEOs held company stock worth eight times annual 
base salary at the median, up significantly from the five-times-pay multiple recorded just two years earlier.</P>
<P>Stock options remain the most common long-term incentive in use, granted by 89% of the companies studied. This is up from 
75% granting stock options the previous year.</P>
<P>The analysis also shows clear differences in incentive payouts to CEOs between the higher- and lower-performing companies 
(as measured by 1995 total shareholder return). For example, the median annual CEO bonus at the higher-performing 
companies was about 86% greater than at the lower-performing companies. A similar pattern was evident in the expected 
value of long-term incentive payouts as well. These findings underscore the pay-for-performance connection inherent in 
incentives.</P>
