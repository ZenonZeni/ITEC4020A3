<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<P><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radon and it's daughter by-products are naturally occurring radioactive compounds resulting from the normal decay of uranium.  As radon gas forms, it seeps upward to the surface of the Earth and spews into the open air, quickly dissipating.  As it escapes through soil and rock, it may enter basements, foundations, or crawlspaces of houses and buildings through cracks and crevices.  Upon entering a dwelling, it may become concentrated inside, resulting in radon exposure risks to occupants.  While inhalation of radon gas poses the most significant health risk, radon gas may also pervade groundwater supplies, posing a health hazard in drinking water as well.</font></p> 
<P><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to tobacco smoke, radon gas and its daughters are the most serious environmental carcinogen known.  It is invisible, tasteless and odorless; without proper testing, its presence cannot be detected.  Continued exposure to radon can significantly increase the risk for lung cancer.  As with many other environmental pollutants, risks due to radon exposure are far greater for smokers and those persons affected by passive smoking.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Action Level is 4 pCI/L.  The EPA has estimated that radon concentrations in 1 out of 4 homes in the United States exceeds the Action Level.</font>
<P><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, radon can be easily detected and steps taken to greatly reduce radon risks.  Sentinel offers affordable test kits to measure radon levels in your home or occupied facility.</font></p>
