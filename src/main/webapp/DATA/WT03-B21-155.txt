<P>TVX GOLD FURTHER STRENGTHENS ITS SENIOR OPERATING MANAGEMENT TEAM

<P>Toronto, Ontario, May 31, 1996 ... Mr. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce the continued strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointment of Mr. Kenneth J. Sangster as Senior Vice President, European Operations. The appointment of Mr. Sangster, in conjunction with the recent appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations, provides the Corporation with strong and experienced senior operations management to lead its expanding operations and project development teams.

<P>Kenneth Sangster, as Senior Vice President, European Operations, joins TVX from Outokumpu Oy where, since 1990, he has held the senior executive position responsible for the development of the $600 million Zaidivar mine and processing plant in Chile, a 50/50 joint venture between Outokumpu Oy and Placer Dome. Beginning in 1965, Mr. Sangster worked for Anglo American in Zambia in various capacities before moving to Consolidated Gold Fields in Australia in 1969 as a Metallurgical Superintendent. In 1975, Mr. Sangster joined RTZ Metals Europe as Group Technical Director where he was responsible for, among other things, the recommissioning of the Wheal Jane tin mine, technical representation on the $400 million Neves Corvo copper/tin mine development in Portugal and acted as senior consulting metallurgist on a variety of RTZ European projects. Mr. Sangster is currently the President of the U.K. Mineral Industry Research Organization, a member of the Eurometeaux Research Panel and a Board Member of the Mining Association of the U.K.

<P>The appointment of Mr. Sangster, who is expected to assume his new position in August, and the recent appointments of Messrs. Murray and Davis provide TVX with three new senior members of its Operating team (having over 90 combined years of mining industry-related experience) and will strengthen TVX Gold's management as the Corporation continues the successful development of its global assets.
