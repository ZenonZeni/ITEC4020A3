<P> This is a naturally aspirated twin rotor wankel RCE, 814 cc, weight
48 kg, power 70 hp at 6000 rpm, torque 90 Nm at 4000 rpm, fuel unleaded.
It is available from Wankel Rotary GmbH, PO Box 1140, D-71398 Korb,

<P> <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid West</A> engines have been used by
Schleicher and Glaser Dirks for motorgliders.  <A HREF =

<H2> Mazda Conversions </H2>

<P> David Munday reports on a talk Tracy Crook gave at the April 15,
1996 Sun-N-Fun on "<A HREF = "munday1.html">Mazda Performance
Update</A>".  Cook has a newsletter.

<P> <A HREF = "munday2.html"><EM>Contact!</EM></A> magazine has several
articles on Mazda conversions.

<P> Dave Klingler reports remembering that "Duncan Aviation used to
produce a single rotor version of a [Mazda] 12A, essentially a 12A cut
in half".  The weight may have been around 160 lbs, and power about
90-100 hp with tuned exhaust.  Duncan is a controversial figure.
Klingler continues "I knew him [Dan Duncan] for a short time, and around
me he was an extremely honest man and a wealth of information about
aviation rotaries."

<P> <A HREF =
"http://www.azstarnet.com/~cmddata/homebuilt/vendors/engines/powerplant.html">Michael
Kraus</A> lists many aircraft engines.  111 piston engines have power
and weight figures.  The power to weight ratios (hp to lb) vary from
0.33 to 0.86, and the average is 0.604.  Additionally, three Hirth F30
(two-stroke?), a "Wankel turbo", and a Solar T62 turbine are listed with
power to weight ratios of 0.94, 1.10, 1.20, 1.20, and 1.30 respectively.

100 engines for the Air Force.
