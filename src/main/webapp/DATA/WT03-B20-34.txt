<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<HR><P>

<P>
Our Nation's progress depends on our ability to use our energy resources in ways that strengthen our competitive economy, protect our environment, and keep our Nation secure. The Clinton Administration has embarked upon a sustainable energy policy that improves our standard of living today and expands our Nation's opportunities for tomorrow.<BR>

<P>

Although Americans tend to focus on energy issues only in periods of energy crises, as a Nation we should be concerned about energy at all times. Energy's continuing importance is grounded in three central facts:<BR>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Energy Fuels a Competitive Economy. Our standard of living and industrial productivity require reliable and competitively priced energy supplies. U.S. businesses and consumers directly spend more than $500 billion per year on energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Energy Affects the Quality of the Environment. The United States has made significant strides in reducing the environmental impacts of energy production and use. These impacts include air and water pollution; nuclear, toxic, and other waste disposal; disruption of wilderness and natural ecosystems; and greenhouse gas emissions. But to make additional progress in reducing environmental risks, we need new, more cost-effective approaches to address the problems we have already tackled, along with innovative methods to counter emerging risks.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Energy Affects Our National Security. Disruptions in global oil markets and energy price shocks have been followed by three recessions in the past 20 years. Energy policy can help reduce the economic and national security risks of relying on oil produced in unstable regions of the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

The concept of "sustainable development"-development that meets the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs-guides the formulation of the Administration's energy policy and motivates three strategic goals: <BR>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Maximize energy productivity to strengthen our economy and improve living standards.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Prevent pollution to reduce the adverse environmental impacts associated with energy production, delivery, and use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Keep America secure by reducing our vulnerability to global energy market shocks.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

Sustainable energy policy pursues all three goals, because actions that further one goal at the expense of the others can increase the economic, environmental, or security risks borne by future generations.

<BR><P>

 

When markets do not maximize energy productivity, adequately protect the environment, or reflect national security considerations, Administration policy aligns market forces and technology development with the goals of sustainable development. These efforts yield immediate and significant benefits for consumers and firms and lay the foundation for sustained progress.<BR>

<P>

The Administration pursues a wide range of programs to attain the goals of national energy policy. The following are the strategic components of sustainable energy policy:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Increase the Efficiency of Energy Use<a href="ch3a.html"> (Chapter 3)</a>. A fundamental tenet of sustainable development is to use resources efficiently. The Administration pursues market and technology programs that help our citizens use energy more efficiently and maximize energy productivity and value. These programs help improve  energy efficiency in all critical market segments-commercial and residential buildings, transportation, industry, utilities, and government.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Develop a Balanced Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio <a href="ch4a.html">(Chapter 4)</a>. The Administration is committed to enhancing the competitiveness of domestic oil producers, expanding the role of clean, efficient, and domestically produced natural gas, encouraging the continued development of renewable energy resources, reducing the environmental impacts of coal, and maintaining the safe contribution of nuclear energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Invest in Science and Technology Advances<a href="ch5.html"> (Chapter 5)</a>. Technological progress enables us to expand our resources, improve efficiency, and reduce the environmental impacts of producing, transporting, and consuming energy. The Administration's science and technology policy complements private sector research and development efforts with public investments in areas where the long-term economic, environmental, or social objectives are not adequately or immediately rewarded in the marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Reinvent Environmental Protection <a href="ch6.html">(Chapter 6)</a>. Americans solidly support a cleaner and healthier environment, and as a Nation, we have enjoyed substantial progress in protecting our environment and decreasing public health risks over the past two decades. By combining market forces and technology, the Administration has undertaken many initiatives to increase energy efficiency, prevent pollution, reduce costs, enhance flexibility, and strengthen accountability. Taken as a whole, these initiatives are the first steps in reinventing environmental protection to achieve a more sustainable system.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Engage the International Market <a href="ch7.html">(Chapter 7)</a>. The development of international markets for energy and technology both poses risks and presents opportunities for our Nation. Through international technology and development programs, participation in multilateral activities, support for privatization and competitive markets abroad, and a strong commitment to U.S. companies that export the energy technologies that will enable sustainable development, the Administration can expand high-wage jobs in the United States and help other nations develop in ways that will ease the burden of energy development on the global environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
