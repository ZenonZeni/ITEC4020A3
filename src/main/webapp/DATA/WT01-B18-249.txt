Dear Senator Grassley:  

     This is in response to your letter of October 25, 1993, on 
behalf of your constituent, Mr. Carl E. Olsen.  

     As you are aware, your constituent has appealed the Drug 
Enforcement Administration's (DEA) nonacceptance of his petition 
to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 
Controlled Substances Act to the United States Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia.  Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 811, and 
interested party can petition the DEA to reschedule a controlled 
substance.  When such a petition is filed with the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, it is carefully evaluated to 
determine whether the petition meets the requirements of 21 
C.F.R. § 1308.44.  Section (b) of that regulation requires that 
the petition conform to the format provided and be readily 
understood.  If the petition is accepted for filing, the 
Administrator will evaluate the petition on its merits.  If the 
petition is not accepted for filing, the Administrator will 
notify the petitioner of his decision and reasons thereof.  21 
C.F.R. § 1308.44(c).  A copy of the regulation has been provided 
for your convenience.  

     Despite Mr. Olsen's contentions, the Administrator did not 
review the grounds upon which Mr. Olsen relied in his petition 
before refusing to accept his petition.  However, DEA has 
recognized that the requirement that a petition be accepted for 
filing absent some ambiguity or some defect in format was not met 
in this matter.  Therefore, in the pending case before the Court 
of Appeals, DEA has asked for a remand of the action in order 
that the Administrator may accept Mr. Olsen's petition for filing 
and review that petition on its merits.  The DEA is constrained 
from commenting further on the merits of Mr. Olsen's case since 
it is currently pending before the court of appeals.  

     I hope the foregoing will assist you in responding to your 
constituent.  

     Sincerely,  

     Stephen H. Greene  
     Acting Administrator of Drug Enforcement 
</PRE>
