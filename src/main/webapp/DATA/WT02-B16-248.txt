<p><strong>Sandia Partnership Has Great Potential for PV in Mexico</strong>

<img border=0 hspace=15 vspace=3 align=left src="images/mexican.gif">
<p>As part of a major agricultural development program, Sandia National
Laboratories has been providing technical assistance to Mexico's Trust for Shared Risk of the
Federal Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, and Rural Development (known as FIRCO, based
on its Spanish name).  Sandia is working with FIRCO to incorporate the use of renewable-energy
 technologies, like PV, in several pilot projects in four Mexican states. 

<p>Work began in the northern state of Sonora, where five PV water-pumping systems (ranging in
size from 350 to 1000 watts) have already been installed and at least 12 more projects will be
implemented by the end of 1996. The installed systems use Siemens and Solarex PV panels and
Grundfos submersible pumps.  Applied Power Corporation supplied design assistance and
hardware through its Mexican partner.  In Chihuahua, Sandia and FIRCO have helped form a
renewable-energy working group, through which 11 PV water-pumping projects have been
installed and as many as 50 more are planned. This program has recently expanded to the states
of Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, where project development is already under way. 

<p>FIRCO represents a major market opportunity for renewable-energy technologies like PV in
Mexico. Although FIRCO is a federal agency, it operates through offices in each of the Mexican
states.  In addition to livestock water pumping, FIRCO engineers implement a variety of rural
economic development programs, including automated milking and refrigeration for dairy farms,
electric fencing for cattle ranching, cheese processing, electrified corn grinding, and small-scale
irrigation. Since many FIRCO projects are located far from the electricity grid, and because
Mexico has an abundance of renewable resources, PV represents a viable option for many of
these development applications. 

<p>Based on these recent successes, FIRCO and Sandia have agreed to expand the project and work
to incorporate renewable-energy technologies, like PV, into a $225 million (financed by the
World Bank) agricultural development program in 10 additional states.  This program is jointly
funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Energy.
