Singapore Steps up Enforcement</h2>

<ul>


<p>

A Korean joint venture firm, Ssangyong-Guan Ho Joint Venture, was

fined a record S$1.56 million for employing illegal foreign workers.  After a

3.5 day trial in August 1996, the firm was convicted of 50 charges of having

illegal aliens on a construction site and fined S$23,000 per illegal alien,

plus S$412,000 for three-years of unpaid levies; 26 workers were employed

without work permits.<p>

During a March 1996 raid, inspectors found 188 Indonesian and Malaysian

workers; 139 without valid entry permits and 49 without work permits.<p>

A new law went into effect in March 1996 that makes the general contractor

responsible for all violations of immigration laws at construction

sites.<p>

In December 1996, Singapore permitted janitorial service firms to recruit

workers not only in Malaysia, but also in Bangladesh, Thailand and the

Philippines for public sector cleaning jobs.  About 32 of the 262 registered

cleaning contractors in Singapore are expected to qualify to recruit additional

foreign workers.  The cleaning industry estimates the current shortage of

workers at 30 per cent to 40 per cent.<p>
