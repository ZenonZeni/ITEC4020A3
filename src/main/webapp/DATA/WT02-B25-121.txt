<p align="center"><b>BRAIN DISORDERS: BIOLOGICALLY BASED AND
TREATABLE&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Parkinson&#146;s disease. Alzheimer&#146;s disease. Epilepsy.
Schizophrenia. All four are brain disorders, but only the first
three are covered adequately by insurance. This discrimination
and lack of parity in health insurance coverage for brain
disorders are both inexcusable and based on the profound misperception
that diseases like schizophrenia are behavioral problems, rather
than treatable medical conditions.</p>

<p>Despite age-old myths and misinformation, the brain disorders
schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major depression
are not caused by bad character, poor child-rearing, or an
individual&#146;s behavior. They are biologically based physical
disorders that can be diagnosed and effectively treated. Left
untreated, disorders of the brain can be profoundly disabling,
disrupting a person&#146;s ability to think, feel, and relate to
others and to his or her environment.</p>

<p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or
five million Americans, suffer from a severe form of a brain
disorder. Forty percent of these individuals do not seek
treatment, oftentimes because they are either not covered by
insurance or because they do not believe they can be helped.</p>

<p>Thanks to major scientific advances, researchers have been
able to identify several biological factors -- such as brain
chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as genes -- that
are among the causes of brain disorders. Scientists have
identified the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine
and their receptors, which determine much of our mental and
physical activities. Imbalances in these chemicals have been
linked to brain disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.
Further, through advanced imaging technology, scientists have
identified structural and functional differences in the brains of
individuals with brain disorders.</p>

<p>Like other medical problems, brain disorders can be
effectively diagnosed and treated with medications and other
therapies. According to the National Institute of Mental Health,
success rates for treating severe forms of the five major brain
disorders for which we advocate are as follows: schizophrenia, 60
percent; panic disorder, 70 to 90 percent; OCD, 75 percent;
bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), 80 to 90 percent;
and major depression, 70 to 80 percent.</p>

<p>Compare these rates with the success rates for treating other
common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (45 to 50
percent), and it is clear that the success rates are not only comparable;
they are in many cases far better for treatment of brain
disorders.</p>

<p>But treatment of brain disorders costs more, right? Wrong. The
cost of treating brain disorders is very much in line with the
cost of treating other medical illnesses. For example, the total
direct cost in 1990 of treating a person with severe diabetes was
$7,725, compared with $7,158 for treating a person with
schizophrenia.</p>

<p>When illness strikes any other organ of the body, health
insurance covers treatment. When illness strikes the brain, full
coverage is very rarely available, and the illness becomes a
crushing burden, both personally and financially.</p>

<p>It is no secret that brain disorders are shrouded in stigma
and discrimination. For centuries they have been misunderstood,
feared, hidden, and often ignored. It is time for us to eradicate
this ignorance.</p>

<p>The facts make it clear that health insurance discrimination
against people with brain disorders makes no sense. No scientific
sense. No economic sense. No political sense. No common sense.</p>
