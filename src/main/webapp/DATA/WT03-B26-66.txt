<H4>2. THE ISSUE OF STANDARDS IN AVHRR DATA USE</H4>
<BR>
From the scientific viewpoint, there has been a significant progression
from the type of research paper presented in the inaugural ARSC1 in 1979
to the present ARSC8 in 1996. The mass centre of such presentations has
moved from descriptive work through exploratory research to a point where
advanced measurement based models are being effectively used with remotely
sensed data and widely reported. Remote Sensing is truly becoming a measurement
based activity. Among the international scientific community this progress
is well in train as you will hear from a number of the scientists speaking
today.<BR>
<BR>
However, at the user end, is there evidence of as much progress? If there
is, then it would be seen in a progression from the research question of
&quot;What <I>might</I> AVHRR do for me?&quot; to the operational issue
of &quot;What <I>does</I> AVHRR do for me?&quot;. This last question involves
the development of well defined products and standards as well as well established
methods for creating products of value to specific end users. This is not
so much an issue for research as for specification.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, researchers cannot ignore the issue of standards. Standards
are needed if the AVHRR user industry is to leave R&amp;D 'school' and join
the much more engineering oriented 'workplace'. Engineering based standards
define what levels of processed data product are needed and what methods
of value added processing ensure a product with a guaranteed accuracy or
utility can be delivered. Such standard specifications are needed to protect
data and product suppliers and users. They are also essential tools with
which end users can cost the use of remotely sensed data and value adding
into major projects. I claim that the lack of these is the biggest hurdle
to acceptance of our efforts at this time and more vital to us than the
need to do more advanced research.<BR>
Ideally, standard data products, data processing and interpretation methods
should be: 
<UL>
<LI>specifiable 
<LI>repeatable 
<LI>consistent 
<LI>testable by well defined measures, and 
<LI>[not data or situation dependent] 
</UL>
The last of these is desirable rather than essential.<BR>
<BR>
The standard procedures with such characteristics that are needed in our
industry are also of two basic kinds. The first is for data delivery such
as from an operational receiving station. These are typically set in a 'Levels'
framework and for each level there are a set of specifications and measures
of performance. Perhaps these are not as well developed and consistently
deliverable in Australia as they should be. The second are for value added
products. These may need manuals of standard practice which, if followed,
provide products of a proven standard. Of course, the standard may seem
quite low to many scientists but I believe the current lack of them is causing
problems for researchers and users alike.<BR>
