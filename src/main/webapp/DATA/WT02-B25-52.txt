<h4>December 1996</h4>



<p><font size="4">NAMI has responded to the November 21 Saturday

Night Live the mocked persons with brain disorders in their

&quot;Crazy People Car&quot; skit. We need our grassroots to take

a stand as well. Please write Lorne Michaels, Executive Producer

of Saturday Night Live and Robert Wright, President of NBC, and

let them know that discrimination will NOT be tolerated!</font></p>



<ul>

    <li>The November 21 Saturday Night Live featured a skit

        entitled the &quot;Car for Crazy People.&quot; This skit

        lampooned people with brain disorders by explicitly

        mocking symptoms like auditory delusions, compulsive

        behavior, and hallucinations. The program was in very poor

        taste and was completely inappropriate for television.</li>

    <li>Laurie Flynn, NAMI executive director is quoted in a NAMI

        press release as saying, &quot;this kind of humor is

        pathetic. Mental illnesses are physical disorders of the

        brain; I highly doubt SNL would write a similar skit

        mocking people with AIDS or terminal cancer.&quot;</li>

<h4>August 1996</h4>



<p><font size="4">NAMI has learned of a computer game that is due

to be released this fall by Sierra On-Line which exploits the

stigma associated with brain disorders. We are asking that all

NAMI members write, phone, fax, and/or email this company demanding

they to cease the manufacture of this damaging and hurtful

product.</font></p>



<ul>

    <li>Sierra On-Line promotes the game, &quot;<u>Phantasmagoria

        2: A Puzzle of Flesh</u>,&quot; as a &quot;psychological horror

        story of madness, murder, and the blackest depths of the

        human soul&quot; at the <a

        href="http://www.sierra.com/games/phantas2">game&#146;s

        Web page</a> .</li>

    <li>The game is described in a July 1996 article of <i>PC

        GAMES</i> magazine as a CD-ROM computer game in which the

        main character must &quot;escape&quot; from the clutches

        of his &quot;mental troubles.&quot; The character experiences

        auditory and visual hallucinations and relives the memory

        of his mother&#146;s suicide. In addition, the character

        is forced to flee from a &quot;mental institution and the

        sadistic doctor who delighted in torturing him.&quot;

        Eventually, the character, &quot;being pursued by

        madness&quot; is &quot;fingered as the prime

        suspect&quot; in a series of murders.</li>

</ul>



<p>This product is abhorrent and discriminatory. Please help NAMI

tell Sierra On-Line that this sort of stigmatizing stereotyping

is absolutely unacceptable!</p>



<p>NAMI has expressed our concerns and outrage at the &quot;<u>Phantasmagoria

2: A Puzzle of Flesh</u>&quot; computer game. All NAMI members

and friends are encouraged to contact Ken Williams, the CEO of Sierra On-Line,

and let him know that stigma and discrimination against people

with brain disorders is not tolerable.</p>
