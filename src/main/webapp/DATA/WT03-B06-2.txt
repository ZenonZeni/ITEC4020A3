Aeromexico to Cut Costs

     Aerovias de Mexico (Aeromexico) has launched a cost reduction
program as well as a program to expand its charter flight services
in the United States and Canada.

     The program will be fully implemented by the end of the third
quarter.  The target is a reduction of 4 percent of the airline's
monthly expenses, resulting in savings of about US$3 million a
month.  Measures include reducing the costs of:  fuel consumption
by 1.5 percent through preferred fuel loadings and rationalization
of reserve fuel loadings; leases by 4 percent by extending and
refinancing leases and reducing the amounts of the credit letters
(a project that started six months ago); workforce by 12 percent;
ramp services by 3 percent via a joint venture with ASA and
MEXICANA solely to provide these services; and, maintenance per
hour by 17 percent through the reduction of the number of full-time
employees and better scheduling of maintenance services.

     This winter Aeromexico will begin service to Toronto, Vancouver,
Winnipeg and elsewhere in Canada, and in the northern U.S., to
Seattle, Portland and other destinations.

Border Toxics Case:  Keelco Anodes

     Two brothers, Donald and Ed Huseman of Palos Verdes, California,
have been arrested for the alleged illegal disposal, storage and
transportation of hazardous lead wastes in Southern California and
Mexico.  Felony charges against the two were brought as a result of
a combined investigation by the California state  Department of
Toxic Substances Control and the Los Angeles County District
Attorney.

     The Husemans own and operate Keelco Anodes Inc. of Wilmington,
California.  A third individual named in the complaint, Jose Kahn,
owner and operator of New Frontier Trading Corp of San Diego was
reported planning to surrender to authorities.

     Keelco manufactures lead keels for boats and lead anodes used in
refining copper from ore.  Keelco and the Husemans are charged with
unlawfully disposing of lead waste on the ground at the Wilmington
site and at Quay Street, adjacent to the business.  Keelco
employees were unnecessarily exposed to friable waste lead
grindings and that the waste was stored on site illegally for more
than 90 days at a time.

     New Frontier Trading Corp. is a metals brokerage that purchases
waste lead from Keelco and other entities and arranges for its
transportation to Metales y Derivados, a smelter in Tijuana.

An Overview:  Part I

The NAFTA negotiations have been completed and a draft of the
Agreement released.  With this issue MTLR begins a series of
articles providing a broad overview of the content and terms of the
NAFTA.  In the coming months, MTRL will also publish in-depth
analysis of the individual NAFTA chapters.


     A North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will create a free
trade area of 360 million people comprising a market of over US$6
trillion.  Mexico will benefit through substantially increased
economic growth and opportunities; Canada and the U.S. will benefit
economically, as well as politically from a more stable Mexico as
neighbor.

                Objectives

     The opening provisions of the NAFTA formally establish a free
trade area between Canada, Mexico and the United States, consistent
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  They set
out the basic rules and principles that will govern the Agreement
and the objectives that will serve as the basis for interpreting
its provisions.

     The objectives of NAFTA are to eliminate barriers to trade,
promote conditions of fair competition, increase investment
opportunities, provide adequate protection for intellectual
property rights, establish effective procedures for the
implementation and application of NAFTA and for the resolution of
disputes and to further trilateral, regional and multilateral
cooperation.  The NAFTA countries will meet these objectives by
observing the principles and rules of the Agreement, such as
national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment and procedural
"transparency."

     Each country affirms its respective rights and obligations under
the GATT and other international agreements.  For purposes of
interpretation, the Agreement establishes that the NAFTA takes
priority over other agreements to the extent there is any conflict,
but provides for exceptions to this general rule.  For example, the
trade provisions of certain environmental agreements take
precedence over NAFTA, subject to a requirement to minimize incon-
sistencies with the Agreement.

     The opening provisions also set out a general rule regarding the
application of the Agreement to subfederal levels of government in
the three countries.  In addition, this section defines terms that
apply to the whole Agreement, to ensure uniform and consistent
usage.

                Rules of Origin

     NAFTA eliminates all tariffs on goods originating in Canada,
Mexico and the United States over a "transition period."  Rules of
origin are necessary to define which goods are eligible for this
preferential tariff treatment.

     This section of the Agreement is designed to:

*    ensure that NAFTA benefits are accorded only to goods produced
     in the North American region -- not goods made wholly or in
     large part in other countries;

*    provide clear rules and predictable results; and

*    minimize administrative burdens for exporters, importers and
     producers trading under NAFTA.

     The rules of origin specify that goods originate in North
America if they are wholly North American.  Goods containing non-
regional materials are also considered to be North American if the
non-regional materials are sufficiently transformed in the NAFTA
region so as to undergo a specified change in tariff
classification.  In some cases, goods must include a specified
percentage of North American content in addition to meeting the
tariff classification requirement.  The rules of origin section
also contains a provision similar to one in the Canada-United
States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that allows goods to be treated
as originating when the finished good is specifically named in the
same tariff subheading as its parts and it meets the required value
content test.

     Regional value content may be calculated using either the
"transaction-value" or the "net-cost" method.  The transaction-
value method is based on the price paid or payable for a good; this
avoids the need for a complex cost accounting system.  The net-cost
method is based on the total cost of the good less the costs of
royalties, sales promotion, and packaging and shipping.
Additionally, the net-cost method sets a limitation on allowable
interest.  Although producers generally have the option to use
either method, the net-cost method must be used where the
transaction value is not acceptable under the GATT Customs
Valuation Code, and must also be used for certain products, such as
automotive goods.

     In order to qualify for preferential tariff treatment,
automotive goods must contain a specified percentage of North
American content (rising to 62.5 percent for passenger automobiles
and light trucks as well as engines and transmissions for such
vehicles, and to 60 percent for other vehicles and automotive
parts) based on the net-cost formula.  In calculating the content
level of automotive goods, the value of automotive parts from
outside the NAFTA region will be traced through the production
chain to improve the accuracy of the content calculation.  Regional
content averaging provisions afford administrative flexibility for
automotive parts producers and assemblers.

     A de minimis rule prevents goods from losing eligibility for
preference solely because they contain minimal amounts of "non-
originating" material.  Under this rule, a good that would
otherwise fail to meet a specific rule of origin will nonetheless
be considered to be North American if the value of non-NAFTA
materials comprises no more than seven percent of the price or
total cost of the good.

                Customs Administration

     In order to ensure that only goods satisfying the rules of
origin standards are accorded preferential tariff treatment under
the Agreement, and to provide certainty to and streamlined
procedures for importers, exporters and producers in the three
countries, the NAFTA includes a number of provisions on customs
administration.  Specifically, this section provides for:


*    uniform regulations to ensure consistent interpretation,
     application and administration of the rules of origin;

*    a uniform Certificate of Origin as well as certification
     requirements and procedures for importers and exporters that
     claim preferential tariff treatment;

*    common record-keeping requirements in the three countries for
     such goods;

*    rules for both traders and customs authorities with respect to
     verifying the origin of such goods;

*    importers, exporters and producers to obtain advance rulings on
     the origin of goods from the customs authority of the country
     into which the goods are to be imported;

*    the importing country to give exporters and producers in other
     NAFTA countries substantially the same rights of review and
     appeal of its origin determinations and advance rulings as it
     provides to importers in its territory;

*    a trilateral working group to address future modifications of
     the rules of origin and the uniform regulations; and

*    specific time periods to ensure the expeditious resolution of
     disputes regarding the rules of origin between NAFTA partners.

                Trade in Goods

     The NAFTA incorporates the fundamental national treatment
obligation of the GATT.  Once goods have been imported into one
NAFTA country from another NAFTA country, they must not be the
object of discrimination.  This commitment extends to provincial
and state measures.

     These provisions establish rules governing trade in goods with
respect to customs duties and other charges, quantitative
restrictions, such as quotas, licenses and permits, and import and
export price requirements.  They improve and make more secure the
access for goods produced and traded within North America.

Elimination of Tariffs.  The NAFTA provides for the progressive
elimination of all tariffs on goods qualifying as North American
under its rules of origin.  For most goods, existing customs duties
will either be eliminated immediately or phased out in five or ten
equal annual stages.  For certain sensitive items, tariffs will be
phased out over a period of up to fifteen years.  Tariffs will be
phased out from the applied rates in effect on July 1, 1991,
including the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the
Canadian General Preferential Tariff (GPT) rates.  Tariff phase-
outs under the Canada-U.S. FTA will continue as scheduled under
that agreement.  The NAFTA provides that the three countries may
consult and agree on a more rapid phase-out of tariffs.

Import and Export Restrictions.  All three countries will eliminate
prohibitions and quantitative restrictions applied at the border,
such as quotas and import licenses.  However, each NAFTA country
maintains the right to impose border restrictions in limited
circumstances, for example, to protect human, animal or plant life
or health, or the environment.  Special rules apply to trade in
agriculture, autos, energy and textiles.

Drawback.  NAFTA establishes rules on the use of "drawback" or
similar programs that provide for the refund or waiver of customs
duties on materials used in the production of goods subsequently
exported to another NAFTA country.

     Existing drawback programs will terminate by January 1, 2001,
for Mexico-U.S. and Canada-Mexico trade; the Agreement will extend
for two years the deadline established in the Canada-U.S. FTA for
the elimination of drawback programs.  At the time these programs
are eliminated, each NAFTA country will adopt a procedure for goods
still subject to duties in the free trade area to avoid the "double
taxation" effects of the payment of duties in two countries.

     Under these procedures, the amount of customs duties that a
country may waive or refund under such programs will not exceed the
lesser of:


*    duties owed or paid on imported, non-North American materials
     used in the production of a good subsequently exported to
     another NAFTA country; or

*    duties paid to that NAFTA country on the importation of such
     good.

Customs User Fees.  The three countries have agreed not to impose
new customs user fees similar to the U.S. merchandise processing
fee or the Mexican customs processing fee (derechos de tramite
aduanero).  Mexico will eliminate by June 30, 1999, its existing
customs processing fee on North American goods.  The United States
will eliminate its current merchandise processing fee on goods
originating in Mexico by the same date.  For goods originating in
Canada, the United States currently is phasing down and will
eliminate this fee by January 1, 1994, as provided for in the
Canada-U.S. FTA.

Waiver of Customs Duties.  The NAFTA prohibits any new performance-
based customs duty waiver or duty remission programs.  Existing
programs in Mexico will be eliminated by January 1, 2001.
Consistent with the obligations of the Canada-U.S. FTA, Canada will
end its existing duty remission programs by January 1, 1998.

Export Taxes.  The NAFTA prohibits all three countries from
applying export taxes unless such taxes are also applied on goods
to be consumed domestically.  Limited exceptions allow Mexico to
impose export taxes in order to relieve critical shortages of
foodstuffs and basic goods.

Other Export Measures.  When a NAFTA country imposes an export
restriction on a product, it must not reduce the proportion of
total supply of that product made available to the other NAFTA
countries below the level of the preceding three years or other
agreed period; impose a higher price on exports to another NAFTA
country than the domestic price; or require the disruption of
normal supply channels.  Based on a reservation that Mexico has
taken, these obligations do not apply as between Mexico and the
other NAFTA countries.

Duty-Free Temporary Admission of Goods.  The Agreement allows
business persons covered by NAFTA's "temporary entry" provisions to
bring into a NAFTA country professional equipment and "tools of the
trade" on a duty-free, temporary basis.  These rules also cover the
importation of commercial samples, certain types of advertising
films, and goods imported for sports purposes or for display and
demonstration.  Other rules provide that by 1998 all goods that are
returned after repair or alteration in another NAFTA country will
re-enter duty-free.  The United States undertakes to clarify what
ship repairs done in other NAFTA countries on U.S.-flagged vessels
qualify for preferential duty treatment.

Country-of-Origin Marking.  This section also provides principles
and rules governing country-of-origin marking.  These provisions
are designed to minimize unnecessary costs and facilitate the flow
of trade within the region, while ensuring that accurate infor-
mation about the country of origin remains available to purchasers.

Alcoholic Beverages -- Distinctive Products.  The three countries
have agreed to recognize Canadian Whiskey, Tequila, Mexcal, Bourbon
Whiskey and Tennessee Whiskey as "distinctive products" and to
prohibit the sale of products under these names unless they meet
the requirements of their country of origin.

                Textiles and Apparel

     This section of the NAFTA provides special rules for trade in
fibers, yarns, textiles and clothing in the North American market.
The NAFTA textiles and apparel provisions take precedence over
those of the Multifiber Arrangement and other agreements between
NAFTA countries applicable to textile products.

Elimination of Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers

     The three countries will eliminate immediately or phase out over
a maximum period of ten years their customs duties on textile and
apparel goods manufactured in North America that meet the NAFTA
rules of origin.  In addition, the United States will immediately
remove import quotas on such goods produced in Mexico, and will
gradually phase out import quotas on Mexican textile and apparel
goods that do not meet such rules.  No NAFTA country may impose any
new quota, except in accordance with specified "safeguard"
provisions.

Safeguards

     If textile or apparel producers face serious damage as a result
of increased imports from another NAFTA country, the importing
country may, during the "transition period," either increase
tariffs or, with the exception of Canada-U.S. trade, impose quotas
on the imports to provide temporary relief to that industry,
subject to specific disciplines.  In the case of goods that meet
NAFTA's rules of origin, the importing country may take safeguard
actions only in the form of tariff increases.

Rules of Origin

     Specific rules of origin in the NAFTA define when imported
textile or apparel goods qualify for preferential treatment.  For
most products, the rule of origin is "yarn forward," which means
that textile and apparel goods must be produced from yarn made in
a NAFTA country in order to benefit from such treatment.  A "fiber
forward" rule is provided for certain products such as cotton and
man-made fiber yarns.  Fiber forward means that goods must be
produced from fiber made in a NAFTA country.  In other cases,
apparel cut and sewn from certain imported fabrics that the NAFTA
countries agree are in short supply, such as silk, linen and
certain shirting fabrics, can qualify for preferential treatment.

     Additional provisions, responsive to the needs of North American
industry, include "tariff rate quotas" (TRQs), under which yarns,
fabrics and apparel that are made in North America, but that do not
meet the rules of origin, can still qualify for preferential duty
treatment up to specified import levels.  The TRQs for Canada that
were included in the Canada-U.S. FTA have been increased and
provide for an annual growth rate for at least the first five
years.

     The NAFTA countries will undertake a general review of the
textile and apparel rules of origin prior to January 1, 1998.  In
the interim, they will consult on request on whether specific goods
should be made subject to different rules of origin, taking into
account the availability of supply within the free trade area.  In
addition, the three countries have established a process to permit
annual adjustments to TRQ levels.

Labelling Requirements

     A joint government and private sector Committee on Labelling for
Textile Products will recommend ways to eliminate unnecessary
obstacles to textile trade resulting from different labelling
requirements in the three countries through a work program to
develop uniform labelling requirements, for example regarding
pictograms and symbols, care instructions, fiber content
information and methods for attachment of labels.

                Automotive Goods

     The NAFTA will eliminate barriers to trade in North American
automobiles, trucks, buses and parts (automotive goods) within the
free trade area, and eliminate investment restrictions in this
sector, over a ten-year transition period.

Tariff Elimination

     Each NAFTA country will phase out all duties on its imports of
North American automotive goods during the transition period.  Most
trade in automotive goods between Canada and the United States is
conducted on a duty-free basis under the terms of either the
Canada-U.S. FTA or the Canada-U.S. "Autopact."

Vehicles.  Canada and the United States eliminated tariffs on their
trade in vehicles under the Canada-U.S. FTA.  Under the NAFTA, for
its imports from Mexico, the United States will:


*    eliminate immediately its tariffs on passenger automobiles;

*    reduce immediately to ten percent its tariffs on light trucks
     and phase out the remaining tariffs over five years; and

*    phase out its tariffs on other vehicles over ten years.

     For imports from Canada and the United States, Mexico will:


*    reduce immediately by 50 percent its tariffs on passenger
     automobiles and phase out the remaining tariffs over 10 years;

*    reduce immediately by 50 percent its tariffs on light trucks and
     phase out the remaining tariffs over five years; and

*    phase out its tariffs on all other vehicles over ten years.

     Canada will eliminate its tariffs on vehicles imported from
Mexico on the same schedule as Mexico will follow for imports from
Canada and the United States.

Parts.  Each country will eliminate its remaining tariffs on
certain automotive parts immediately and phase out duties on other
parts over five years and a small portion over ten years.

Rules of Origin

     The NAFTA rules of origin section provides that in order to
qualify for preferential tariff treatment, automotive goods must
contain a specified percentage of North American content (rising to
62.5 percent for passenger automobiles and light trucks as well as
engines and transmissions for such vehicles, and to 60 percent for
other vehicles and automotive parts) based on the net-cost formula.
In calculating the content level of automotive goods, the value of
imports of automotive parts from outside the NAFTA region will be
traced through the production chain to improve the accuracy of the
content calculation.

Mexican Auto Decree

     The Mexican Auto Decree will terminate at the end of the
transition period.  Over this period, the restrictions under the
Auto Decree will be modified by:


*    eliminating immediately the limitation on imports of vehicles
     based on sales in the Mexican market;

*    amending its "trade balancing" requirements immediately to
     permit assemblers to reduce gradually the level of exports of
     vehicles and parts required to import such goods, and
     eliminating, at the end of the transition period, the
     requirement that only assemblers in Mexico may import vehicles;

*    changing its "national value-added" rules by reducing gradually
     the percentage of parts required to be purchased from Mexican
     parts producers; by counting purchases from certain in-bond
     production facilities (maquiladoras) toward this percentage; by
     ensuring that Canadian, Mexican and U.S. parts manufacturers may
     participate in the growing Mexican market on a competitive
     basis, while requiring assemblers in Mexico during the
     transition period to continue to purchase parts from Mexican
     parts producers; and by eliminating at the end of the transition
     period the national value-added requirement.

Mexican Auto-Transportation Decree

     The Mexican Auto-Transportation Decree covering trucks (other
than light trucks) and buses will be eliminated immediately, and
replaced with a transitional system of quotas in effect for five
years.

Imports of Used Vehicles

     Canada's remaining restrictions on the import of used motor
vehicles from the United States will be eliminated on January 1,
1994, in accordance with the Canada-U.S. FTA.  Beginning 15 years
after the NAFTA goes into effect, Canada will phase out over ten
years its prohibition on imports of Mexican used motor vehicles.
Mexico will phase out its prohibition on imports of North American
used vehicles over the same period.

Investment Restrictions

     In accordance with the NAFTA's investment provisions, Mexico
will immediately permit "NAFTA investors" to make investments of up
to 100 percent in Mexican "national suppliers" of parts, and up to
49 percent in other automotive parts enterprises, increasing to 100
percent after five years.  Mexico's thresholds for the screening of
takeovers in the automotive sector will be governed by NAFTA's
investment provisions.

Corporate Average Fuel Economy Fleet Content

     Under the NAFTA, the United States will modify the fleet content
definition found in its Corporate Average-Fuel Economy (CAFE)
rules, so that vehicle manufacturers may choose to have those
Mexican-produced parts and vehicles they export to the United
States classified as domestic.  After ten years, Mexican production
exported to the United States will receive the same treatment as
U.S. or Canadian production for purposes of CAFE.  Canadian-
produced automobiles currently may be classified as domestic for
CAFE purposes.  The NAFTA does not change the minimum fuel economy
standards for vehicles sold in the United States.

Automotive Standards

     The NAFTA creates a special intergovernmental group to review
and make recommendations on federal automotive standards in the
three countries, including recommendations to achieve greater
compatibility in such standards.

                Energy and Basic Petrochemicals

     This section sets out the rights and obligations of the three
countries regarding crude oil, gas, refined products, basic
petrochemicals, coal, electricity and nuclear energy.

     In the NAFTA, the countries confirm their full respect for their
constitutions.  They also recognize the desirability of
strengthening the important role that trade in energy and basic
petrochemical goods plays in the North American region and of
enhancing this role through sustained and gradual liberalization.

     The NAFTA's energy provisions incorporate and build on GATT
disciplines regarding quantitative restrictions on imports and
exports as they apply to energy and basic petrochemical trade.  The
NAFTA provides that under these disciplines a country may not
impose minimum or maximum import or export price requirements,
subject to the same exceptions that apply to quantitative
restrictions.  The NAFTA also makes clear that each country may
administer export and import licensing systems, provided that they
are operated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the
Agreement.  In addition, no country may impose a tax, duty or
charge on the export of energy or basic petrochemical goods unless
the same tax, duty or charge is applied to such goods when consumed
domestically.

     This section also provides that import and export restrictions
on energy trade will be limited to certain specific circumstances,
such as to conserve exhaustible natural resources, deal with a
short-supply situation or implement a price stabilization plan.

     Further, when a NAFTA country imposes any such restriction, it
must not reduce the proportion of total supply made available to
the other NAFTA countries below the level of the preceding three
years or other agreed period, impose a higher price on exports to
another NAFTA country than the domestic price or require the
disruption of normal supply channels.  Based on a reservation that
Mexico has taken, these obligations do not apply as between Mexico
and the other NAFTA countries.

     This section also limits the grounds on which a NAFTA country
may restrict exports or imports of energy or basic petrochemical
goods for reasons of national security.  However, based on a
reservation that Mexico has taken, energy trade between Mexico and
the other NAFTA countries will not be subject to this discipline,
but will instead be governed by the Agreement's general national
security provision, described in the "Exceptions" section.

     The NAFTA confirms that energy regulatory measures are subject
to the Agreement's general rules regarding national treatment,
import and export restrictions and export taxes.  The three
countries also agree that the implementation of regulatory measures
should be undertaken in a manner that recognizes the importance of
a stable regulatory environment.

     In the NAFTA, Mexico reserves to the Mexican State goods,
activities and investments in Mexico in the oil, gas, refining,
basic petrochemicals, nuclear and electricity sectors.

     The NAFTA energy provisions recognize new private investment
opportunities in Mexico in non-basic petrochemical goods and in
electricity generating facilities for "own use," cogeneration and
independent power production by allowing NAFTA investors to
acquire, establish and operate facilities in these activities.
Investment in non-basic petrochemical goods is governed by the
general provisions of the Agreement.

     To promote cross-border trade in natural gas and basic
petrochemicals, NAFTA provides that state enterprises, end users
and suppliers have the right to negotiate supply contracts.  In
addition, independent power producers, CFE (Mexico's state-owned
electricity firm) and electric utilities in other NAFTA countries
also have the right to negotiate power purchase and sale contracts.

     Each country will also allow its state enterprises to negotiate
performance clauses in their service contracts.

     Certain specific commitments relating to special aspects of
Canada-U.S. energy trade, set out in the Energy Chapter of the
Canada-U.S. FTA, will continue to apply between the two countries.

                Agriculture

     The NAFTA sets out separate bilateral undertakings on cross-
border trade in agricultural products, one between Canada and
Mexico, and the other between Mexico and the United States.  Both
include a special transitional safeguard mechanism.  As a general
matter, the rules of the Canada-U.S. FTA on tariff and nontariff
barriers will continue to apply to agricultural trade between
Canada and the United States.  Trilateral provisions in the NAFTA
address domestic support for agricultural goods and agricultural
export subsidies.

Tariffs and Nontariff Barriers

Trade between Mexico and the United States.  When the Agreement
goes into effect, Mexico and the United States will eliminate
immediately all nontariff barriers to their agricultural trade,
generally through their conversion to either "tariff-rate quotas"
(TRQs) or ordinary tariffs.

     The TRQs will facilitate the transition for producers of import-
sensitive products in each country.  No tariffs will be imposed on
imports within the quota amount.  The quantity eligible to enter
duty-free under the TRQ will be based on recent average trade
levels and will grow generally at three percent per year.  The
over-quota duty -- initially established at a level designed to
equal the existing tariff value of each non-tariff barrier -- will
progressively decline to zero during either a ten- or fifteen-year
period, depending on the product.

     Under the NAFTA, Mexico and the United States will eliminate
immediately tariffs on a broad range of agricultural products.
This means that roughly one-half of U.S.-Mexico bilateral
agricultural trade will be duty-free when the Agreement goes into
effect.  All tariff barriers between Mexico and the United States
will be eliminated no later than ten years after the Agreement
takes effect, with the exception of duties on certain highly
sensitive products -- including corn and dry beans for Mexico, and
orange juice and sugar for the United States.  Tariff phase-outs on
these few remaining products will be completed after five more
years.

     Mexico and the United States will gradually liberalize bilateral
trade in sugar.  Both countries will apply TRQs of equivalent
effect on third country sugar by the sixth year after the Agreement
goes into effect.  All restrictions on trade in sugar between the
two countries will be eliminated by the end of the fifteen-year
transition period, except that sugar exported under the U.S. Sugar
Re-Export Program will remain subject to most-favored-nation (MFN)
tariff rates.

Trade between Canada and Mexico.  Canada and Mexico will eliminate
all tariff and nontariff barriers on their agricultural trade, with
the exception of those in the dairy, poultry, egg and sugar
sectors.

     Canada will immediately exempt Mexico from import restrictions
covering wheat, barley and their products, beef and veal, and
margarine.  Canada and Mexico will eliminate immediately or phase
out within five years tariffs on many fruit and vegetable products,
while tariffs on remaining fruit and vegetable products will be
phased out over ten years.  A small number of these products will
be subject to the special transitional safeguard described below.

     Other than in the dairy, poultry and egg sectors, Mexico will
replace its import licenses with tariffs, for example on wheat, or
TRQs, for example respecting corn and barley.  These tariffs will
generally be phased out over a ten-year period.

Special Safeguard Provision

     During the first ten years the Agreement is in effect, the NAFTA
provides a special safeguard provision that applies to certain
products within the scope of the bilateral undertakings described
above.  A NAFTA country may invoke the mechanism where imports of
such products from the other country reach "trigger" levels set out
in the Agreement.  In such circumstances, the importing country may
apply the tariff rate in effect at the time the Agreement went into
effect or the then-current MFN rate, whichever is lower.  This
tariff rate may be applied for the remainder of the season or the
calendar year, depending on the product.  The trigger levels will
increase over this ten-year period.

Domestic Support

     Recognizing both the importance of domestic support measures to
their respective agricultural sectors and the potential effect of
such measures on trade, each of the NAFTA countries will endeavor
to move toward domestic support policies that are not trade-
distorting.  In addition, the three countries recognize that a
country may change its domestic support mechanisms so long as such
change is in compliance with applicable GATT obligations.

Export Subsidies

     Recognizing that the use of export subsidies within the free
trade area is inappropriate except to counter subsidized imports
from a non-NAFTA country, the Agreement provides that:

*    a NAFTA exporting country must give three-days' notice of its
     intent to introduce a subsidy on agricultural exports to another
     NAFTA country;

*    when an exporting NAFTA country believes that another NAFTA
     country is importing non-NAFTA agricultural goods that benefit
     from export subsidies, it may request consultations on measures
     the importing country could take against such subsidized
     imports; and

*    if the importing country adopts mutually agreed upon measures to
     counter that subsidy, the NAFTA exporting country will not
     introduce its own export subsidy.

     Building on the bilateral discipline on export subsidies in the
Canada-U.S. FTA, the three countries will work toward the
elimination of export subsidies in North American agricultural
trade in pursuit of their objective of eliminating such subsidies
worldwide.

Agricultural Marketing Standards

     The NAFTA provides that when either Mexico or the United States
applies a measure regarding the classification, grading or
marketing of a domestic agricultural product, it will provide no
less favorable treatment to like products imported from the other
country for processing.

Resolution of Commercial Disputes

     The three countries will work toward development of a mechanism
for resolving private cross-border commercial disputes involving
agricultural products.

Committee on Agricultural Trade

     A trilateral committee on agricultural trade will monitor the
implementation and administration of this section.  In addition, a
Mexico-U.S. working group and a Canada-Mexico working group will be
established under the committee to review the operation of grade
and quality standards.

three signatory countries.

Structural Implications of NAFTA

by Ewell E. Murphy, Jr., Esq.

     If the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) succeeds, it
will change the economic geography of our hemisphere, creating a
new North America in which goods and investment will move among
Mexico, Canada and the United States with unprecedented ease.  How
will that affect the structuring of Mexican business operations in
the United States?

                Are joint ventures passe?

     Transnationally, "joint ventures" blossomed in the disruptive
1970s.  They were born of protectionist legal systems that
prevented the foreign investor from controlling the corporation in
which he invested -- such systems as Malaysian Bumiputra, African
"Nigerianization" and Mexico's Echeverrian Investment Law, which in
most industrial sectors limited foreigners to 49 percent of the
equity.

     To sugarcoat such forced marriages, they were named joint
ventures, a label intrinsically false.  The dictionary tells us
that "joint" means sharing or acting in common, and "common" means
belonging equally to, or shared alike by all in question, but a
joint venture neither equally belongs nor is shared alike.
Corporate shares that, held by foreigners, are forever incapable of
being joined with other shares to achieve a wholly-owned subsid-
iary, or even 51 percent control, are in fact second-class shares.
All participants in a joint venture are equal, but some (the
favored local citizens) are more equal than others.

     When structured in a close ownership percentage such as 51/49,
a "joint venture" is inherently difficult to manage over any
considerable period, especially when its investors are from dif-
ferent legal and cultural systems.  Absent legislative coercion
like the Echeverrian Investment Law, there is little compelling
reason for foreign investment to be structured that way,
either in Mexico or in the United States.  Each investment, of
course, must be designed to meet its unique business objectives,
but I suspect that, as a general proposition and over appreciable
time, both sides of the Rio Grande will see fewer such joint
ventures during the NAFTA years.

                Owned or Supervised Distribution

     Another traditional structure that NAFTA will probably make less
typical is Mexican export F.O.B. the border.  All too frequently
that structure has characterized Mexican sales for the U.S. market.
Under it, the Mexican manufacturer sells for export and is paid in
dollars, but leaves actual foreign market penetration to the
purchaser.  After getting the product into the hands of a customs
broker in, say, Nuevo Laredo, the Mexican manufacturer calls it a
day, draws down his dollars, and goes home.

     That structure allocates to the purchaser the risks and
responsibilities of the U.S. market, to be sure, but it also
allocates to him the corresponding value-added.  Consequently the
Mexican manufacturer is an exporter in name only, both as to risks
and as to return.

     One can only speculate why the structure of sales F.O.B. the
border is so prevalent in Mexico.  One reason, perhaps, is that
historically Mexican exports have tended to be raw, semifinished or
fungible products -- metals, ores, cotton, hydrocarbons and the
like -- whose producers had no name~recognition by export
consumers.  Another reason, probably, is the cost and complexity of
financing intermediate distribution.  The legal and practical
aspects of conducting business in the U.S. were no doubt a factor
as well.

     In recent years Mexican manufacturers have begun to overcome
there doubts and concerns, and are penetrating the U.S. export
market more effectively.  A typical new structure is the wholly-
owned distribution subsidiary, which receives the product from its
Mexican manufacturing parent at the Mexican plant or the border and
handles directly all subsequent warehousing and sales to
distributors, dealers or consumers in the United States.  Another
new structure is supervised distribution, under which the Mexican
manufacturer sells to an unrelated U.S. importer at the plant or
border, but also maintains in the United States its own U.S.
subsidiary to check on the importer's efforts and to keep the
Mexican manufacturer directly informed of the U.S. market.  Under
NAFTA, such structures of owned or supervised distribution will
likely become more customary and will bring more value-added back
to Mexico.

                Strategic Alliances

     A more sophisticated prototype for Mexican investment structures
in the new North America is the strategic alliance.  This ingenious
arrangement is designed to coordinate the efforts of two or more
companies in correlative markets.

     Imagine, for example, a U.S. company that is in the top echelon
of its industry in the United States, is fairly competitive but by
no means dominant in Europe, and in Japan is technically able to
perform but feels ostracized by business practices that favor
Japanese companies.  Imagine, in the same industry, a German
company that is well recognized in Europe, somewhat competitive in
the United States, but similarly defensive in Japan.  Add a
Japanese company that leads the industry in Japan but is a newcomer
to Europe and the United States.  How can those three companies
grow in each other's home markets?  One way is to bash ahead
unilaterally, each the best it can.  Another way is through
aggressive attempts at hostile take-over.  A third is by strategic
alliance.

     Strategic alliance structures are infinitely variable, but in
our example each of the three companies might acquire small
minority interests -- say, 10 percent or 20 percent -- in each
other.  At the same time they probably would cross-license certain
technology.  They might also agree to cooperate in bids on projects
of certain types, especially where each can make a unique contribu-
tion, and perhaps arrange to coordinate procurement and training.
If they are manufacturers, they probably would add reciprocal
supply contracts.

     Strategic alliances are not easy to plan or document.  They
require careful legal thinking, especially in antitrust and
intellectual property law.  If successful, however, they offer an
imaginative means for companies to grow, not at the expense or by
the destruction of each other, but by pooling complementary
strengths.

     Strategic alliances between Mexican and U.S. enterprises have
already begun, and it seems likely that a NAFTA will encourage
more.  Such arrangements offer more market scope than simple
wholly-owned subsidiaries and allow more effective management than
is afforded by "joint ventures" with close ownership percentages.
For leading companies that seek coordinated expansion in both the
Mexican and the U.S. markets, strategic alliances may be the
cutting edge of the NAFTA future.

Legal Considerations for Mexican Businesses in the United States

by Ewell E. Murphy, Jr., Esq.


     If the North American Free Trade Agreement is achieved it will
allow a Mexican business, if it is so minded, to go up, beyond the
river, and carry there all the goods and investment capital that it
can find.  And NAFTA will, in time, prohibit any toll, tribute or
custom upon the movement of those goods or capital.

     For Mexican exporters the Hispanic segment of the new NAFTA
market will be especially inviting.  The six states of the United
States over which the flag of Mexico once waved have a combined
population of some 55 million and an aggregate gross product of
nearly US$1 trillion -- equivalent to 60 percent of Mexico's
present population and more than five times its gross domestic
product. note 1  By race, second language, tradition, and proximity
these states are enthusiastically attuned to Mexican culture and
products.  They offer the Mexican exporter his first and easiest
success in the new North America.

     The market that NAFTA will create is, of course, much larger
than those former Mexican lands.  It will be all of North America,
which one projection places at 370 million human beings with a com-
bined gross domestic product of US$6 trillion, larger than the
present European Community. note 2   Some Mexican companies al-
ready, in advance of NAFTA, have made their mark in that larger
market.  Particularly notable are the Modelo breweries, whose
exports of Corona and other brands account for 11.7 percent of all
imported beers sold in the United States, second only to Heineken;
note 3 and Vitro, S.A., which in the acquisition of Anchor Glass
accomplished the first hostile Mexican takeover of a major U.S.
corporation, and with joint ventures with Corning, Inc., Whirlpool,
World Tableware International, and others, is well on its way to
becoming a full-fledged multinational corporation. note 4  Those
attainments in export and investment are persuasive prototypes of
success for Mexican industry in the new North America.

     To achieve that success, however, Mexican business must heed the
advice of Thomas Wolfe, who reminded us that "you can't go home
again."  The home we return to is never the same as the home we
left.  When Mexican business returns to its home beyond the river,
it will enter a world that is radically different, not only from
the world those six states knew under the Mexican flag, but also
from the present world below the Rio Grande.

     Of all the differences the Rio Grande delineates, none is more
striking than the contrasting legal systems of Mexico and the
United States.  Superficially that difference can be catalogued as
the distinction between the civil law and the common law, which
creates the dissimilarities that separate, say, Italy from Britain;
but the incongruities across the Rio Grande are much more profound.
Mexico not only inherited the civil law from Spain, but was
nurtured in a Castilian colonialism that regarded juridical and
economic order as something ordained from above, a commandment from
the ruler to the ruled.  The United States not only learned the
common law from England, but was molded by the rugged individualism
of the frontier into the world's most uncompromising advocate of
democratic initiative and free-market capitalism.

     Consequently, law occupies different dimensions of life above,
than it does below, the Rio Grande.  In Mexico, law is essentially
a vertical force that moves downward from government to people.
When Mexicans have problems with each other they may resort to law,
but usually they resolve their conflicts by other means.  They view
legal duties, fundamentally, not as obligations between individuals
but as exactions of the government.  If the government does not
effectively enforce a particular law, the peoples' response, in the
famous Mexican phrase, is acatar pero no obedecer (respecting but
not complying). note 5

     In sharp contrast, above the Rio Grande law occupies both the
horizontal and the vertical dimensions of life, and vertically it
moves up as well as down.  When people have problems with each
other their first impulse is civil suit.  ("I'll take you to
court!").  If that remedy seems insufficient, they invoke the
government against each other by means of criminal prosecution.
("I'll get the law on you!").  If neither recourse suffices, they
insist that their elected legislators create a new legal remedy.
("There ought to be a law!").  Most significantly, in the United
States the factual application of any law is subject to the concur-
rence of randomly chosen representatives of the local citizenry:
horizontally by civil juries and vertically by the grand juries and
trial juries of criminal prosecution. note 6

                Cultural Shocks

     Those legal differences between Mexico and the United States
create many unpleasant surprises for a Mexican business first
entering the market beyond the river.  In particular, there are
three abrupt cultural shocks:  litigiousness, states' rights, and
compelled competition.

Litigiousness

       The first shock, litigiousness, is the most devastating.  This
characteristic of U.S. society has grown, in two centuries, from a
quaint rambunctiousness to an enormous problem.  With 90 percent of
all civil jury cases in the world tried in the United States,
Americans have been spending US$30 billion a year just suing each
other; between 1975 and 1985, U.S. liability awards in general rose
401 percent, and the number of product liability cases before U.S.
federal courts increased by 1,000 percent. note 7  The resulting
burden on industry is staggering.  The liability insurance costs of
U.S. manufacturers has increased 500 percent over ten years,
constituting, for example, 15 percent of the price of U.S.-made
machine tools and nearly 70 percent of the price of U.S.-made
tetanus vaccine, and demolishing entire product lines, such as
Cessna's single-engine airplanes. note 8

     In Mexico things are different; civil actions do not go to
juries, liability awards are typically for modest sums, and major
public issues are resolved, not by lawsuits, but by political
pressure and economic clout.  Consequently, Mexican entrepreneurs
are unprepared for the hair-trigger litigation and crippling jury
awards they may encounter in the United States.

     Anticipating and defending against Yankee litigiousness is a
principal objective of the investment structure -- the interrelated
framework of corporations and contracts -- by which a Mexican
enterprise achieves a business presence in the U.S. market.  Essen-
tially the structure's strategy is to wall off the main Mexican
enterprise from involvement in the United States.  In an export
structure, for example, the manufacturing source of the product and
its facilities for distribution within Mexico function in -- and
only in -- Mexico.  Distribution in the United States is restricted
to a separate subsidiary corporation whose objective is to limit
the liability of the manufacturing parent to the resources the
parent invests in that subsidiary.  The parent and the subsidiary
are related only by share ownership and by contracts consistent
with their roles.  In such a structure, for example, the parent
contracts to supply the subsidiary, in Mexico, with products; the
subsidiary exports the products from Mexico, imports them into the
United States, warehouses them as needed in the United States, and
resells them to subdistributors, dealers or consumers.  For
additional insulation a special-purpose Mexican export subsidiary
may be placed between the manufacturing parent in Mexico and the
distribution subsidiary in the United States.

     Among the basic risks to consider in planning such an export
structure are the jurisdictional laws of the states in which the
distribution subsidiary will resell.  An example is the Texas Long-
Arm Statute, note 9 which subjects to suit in Texas any corporation
that (1) "contracts by mail or otherwise with a Texas resident and
either party is to perform the contract in whole or in part in
[Texas]," (2) "commits a tort in whole or in part in [Texas]," or
(3) "recruits Texas residents, directly or through an intermediary
located in [Texas], for employment inside or outside [Texas]."

     As construed by the Texas Supreme Court, the Texas Long Arm
Statute is even more grasping than its terms, and will reach as far
as the U.S. Constitution permits.  By that rule, a Mexican
corporation can be sued in Texas if three conditions are met.
First, the corporation purposefully did some act or consummated
some transaction in Texas.  Second, either (a) the cause of action
arose from or was connected with that act or transaction or (b) the
corporation's contacts with Texas were continuing and systematic.
Third, the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice. note 10  Under that
reasoning, recent decisions reflect considerable willingness to
sustain Texas jurisdiction over corporations that make sales into
Texas, regardless of whether they conduct actual sales activities
within the state. note 11

     In the sober aftermath of the Bhopal disaster we realize, of
course, that some liabilities will pierce the most meticulously
crafted corporate and contractual veils.  The most ruthless
penetrator is product liability.  There the principal guidelines
are two decisions of the United States Supreme Court.  World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson note 12 permits product liability
jurisdiction to be asserted over any foreign exporter that delivers
its products into the "stream of commerce" with awareness that they
will be purchased by consumers in the forum state.  Asahi Metal
Industry Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court of California note 13 shields
from that rule certain component manufacturers who sell only to
primary manufacturers abroad.  For direct exporters to the United
States, however, the only reliable precaution is product liability
insurance covering the Mexican manufacturing parent and its entire
corporate group.

     If a Mexican corporation can jurisdictionally be reached for
suit in Texas, it can be sued in Texas on claims for wrongful death
or personal injury arising anywhere in the world.  That was the
startling result of the 1990 decision of the Texas Supreme Court in
Dow Chemical Co. v. Castro Alfaro, note 14 which held that, for
purposes of such claims, the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
under which courts may decline jurisdiction of foreign causes
because of injustice or inconvenience of trial, has been abolished
by statute in Texas.  That decision has made Texas a forum of great
attraction for foreign plaintiffs, and is a strong additional
reason for cautious structuring of Mexican business operations that
cross the Rio Grande.

     There are two helpful resources for contractually defining the
legal boundaries between a Mexican manufacturing parent and its
U.S. distribution subsidiary and between the subsidiary and its
purchasers.  The first is the United Nations Convention on Con-
tracts for the International Sale of Goods, to which Mexico and the
United States have both adhered.  The second is Incoterms, the
International Chamber of Commerce's standard published definitions
of basic trade terms.  A structure whose legal basis is the
Convention and whose points of sale are expressed in Incoterms can
be established by internationally comprehensible contracts that are
explicit but succinct.

     Although disputes with U.S. purchasers cannot be avoided, they
can be diverted to modes of confrontation less problematical than
litigation.  This is another area in which there is a helpful
treaty relationship between Mexico and the United States.  Both
nations adhere to the United Nations Arbitration Convention, and
are thus reciprocally obligated to enforce agreements to arbitrate
and to recognize arbitration awards.  This permits the distribution
subsidiary to ensure, by carefully drawn arbitration clauses, that
disputes arising under its sales contracts will be resolved by
arbitration at acceptable venues under acceptable law.
States' Rights

     The second shock the Mexican exporter encounters beyond the
river is that of states' rights of U.S. federalism.

     To the jaundiced eyes of U.S. lawyers, the Interstate Commerce
Clause and a permissive federal judiciary have well nigh
emasculated the Tenth Amendment, making the United States, for
business purposes, virtually a unitary nation.  But to the Mexican
entrepreneur the opposite seems true.  He planned to introduce his
product into one foreign nation, but to his astonishment he finds
that he confronts fifty-one of them:  fifty corporation laws; fifty
certificate of authority statutes; fifty state tax systems; fifty
state legislatures, judiciaries and executives; and, to make it
even more forbidding, a fifty-first umbrella of federal taxes, laws
and government over-arching all the rest.

     Mexico, by contrast, is a highly centralized nation.  Its
constitution is labeled "federal" but there the federalism ends.
It has one corporation law, one law for the establishment of
foreign enterprise, central control of most taxes, and a tradition
of national domination of the nominally separate states.  Small
wonder that Mexicans are stunned by the balkanized and discordant
system of state authority they encounter north of the Rio Grande.

     The Mexican entrepreneur can deal most effectively with U.S.
states' rights by visualizing the United States as fifty separate
markets, planning carefully in advance, in terms of compliance with
key state requirements, which of the fifty his product will enter.
Aside from product-specific regulations, those key state
requirements are, essentially, certificate of authority laws,
franchise taxes, and taxes generally.

     The Texas Certificate of Authority law, note 15 for example,
allows an uncertificated Mexican corporation to maintain local bank
accounts; to sell in Texas through "independent contractors;" to
create, secure and collect debts; to transact business in
interstate commerce; and to conduct "isolated transactions;" but
requires the corporation to obtain a Certificate of Authority to
"transact business" in Texas otherwise.  Cases have held that no
Certificate of Authority is required to sell into Texas by
interstate shipment on the basis of purchase orders obtained in
Texas but accepted outside. note 16  Consignment sales in Texas by
out-of-state consignors are similarly exempt. note 17

     Previously, the Texas franchise tax system was almost that
indulgent.  The statute note 18 simply said that franchise tax must
be paid by any foreign corporation that has a Texas Certificate of
Authority or "does business" in Texas, and administrative decisions
held that interstate commerce sales into Texas did not constitute
doing business provided they were not obtained by consignment or
regular solicitation within the state. note 19  Recently, however,
administrative rules note 20 of the Comptroller General began to
limit those immunities.  Those rules said that "[p]erformance of a
contract in Texas" or "[h]aving employees, independent contractors,
agents or other representatives in Texas" who "provide or induce
sales of the foreign corporation's goods or services" was "doing
business" for franchise tax purposes.

     Most sweeping of all was the rule of "constitutional nexus,"
which became effective in 1986.  It asserted that "A corporation is
doing business in Texas, for purposes of [franchise tax], when it
has constitutional nexus with Texas for the purpose of franchise
taxation."

     Finally, effective January 1, 1992 those encroaching rules were
replaced with an amendment of the statute itself, which now
provides that Texas franchise tax extends "to the limits of the
United States Constitution and federal law adopted under it." note
21

     For the movement of goods, those Constitutional limits were
drawn by the U.S. Supreme Court's "original package" cases (Brown
v. Maryland note 22 and Low v. Austin note 23) as refined by
Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, note 24 and Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles. note 25  Those decisions exempt from state
taxation a vehicle or instrumentality of foreign commerce, but
allow a state to impose a nondiscriminatory tax on any goods --
imported or domestic -- that have come to rest in a warehouse
within the state.  In Texas the chief tax thus enabled is an annual
levy by counties and local tax authorities on the value of property
within the jurisdiction. note 26

     Another principal source of state and local revenues in Texas is
a sales tax note 27 analogous to, but simpler than, Mexican
Impuesto de Valor Agregado (IVA).

Compelled Competition

     The third shock of U.S. law to Mexican business is the ghost of
Adam Smith.  A fundamental stage direction of the U.S. legal drama
is the rule that its commercial actors must behave like freely-
competing characters from The Wealth of Nations.

     That rule is enforced chiefly by the federal antitrust laws,
which apply to export movements into the U.S. market as well as to
activities within it.  Exports to the United States are covered,
directly or indirectly, by the basic provisions of the Sherman Act
regarding combinations, note 28 the Federal Trade Commission Act
regarding unfair competition, note 29 and the Clayton Act regarding
acquisitions. note 30  Exporters to the United States are
explicitly addressed in the Wilson Tariff Act regarding price-
fixing in imported goods, note 31 and the Robinson-Patman
amendments to the Clayton Act regarding price discrimination and
exclusive dealing. note 32  Once Mexican products have reached the
United States they are subject, like all domestic products, to
general antitrust rules affecting exclusive distributorships, tying
clauses, resale price maintenance, and territorial and customer
restrictions.

     Similarly, when Mexican business engages in a merger,
acquisition or joint venture in the United States, it is subject to
the rules of U.S. antitrust laws against unlawful combinations.
For substantial transactions, that includes the premerger
notification rules of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, note 33 which
require participants in the proposed transaction to give advance
notice to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of
Justice, allowing those agencies a specified period to determine
whether, in their view, the transaction would violate antitrust law
and if so to seek an injunction against it.

     Antitrust Guide for International Operations, a statement of
enforcement policy issued by the Department of Justice in 1988, is
a helpful guide to the transnational application of U.S. antitrust
laws.  In April 1992, however, the Department announced a partial
reversion to pre-1988 policy, in that combinations abroad that
limit the access of U.S. exports to foreign markets will be
prosecuted regardless of their effect on U.S. consumers. note 34

     The ghost of Adam Smith is also invoked, in the name of "fair
trade," to justify two U.S. penalties on inbound goods, although
most observers classify those penalties as market distortions
themselves.

     One is antidumping, a form of protectionism pioneered by the
United States note 35 and under which the U.S. has imposed more
penalties than any country in the world. note 36  By it, the United
States levies on the Mexican product an additional import duty
equal to the amount by which its value in the foreign market
exceeds its U.S. market price. note 37  The technicalities of that
determination are complicated, and the administrative procedures
for assessing and collecting the resulting duties are elaborate.
The only saving grace is that, to impose antidumping duties,
"material injury" to a U.S. industry must be shown.

     Another fair trade protectionism is countervailing duties. note
38  Here the law assesses penalty duties, not to offset lower
prices, but to compensate for government subsidies from which the
product benefited in its country of origin.  The United States has
the dubious distinction of having imposed more countervailing
duties than the rest of the world combined note 39 and, in fact, to
be the only nation to have used them extensively. note 40
Fortunately for Mexican exporters, a 1985 agreement between Mexico
and the United States note 41 placed Mexican products temporarily
within the protected category in which U.S. countervailing duties
may not be assessed unless the claimant proves material injury to
a U.S. industry.  Mexico's access to that category was confirmed in
1986 by Mexico's decision to join the GATT and accept its Subsidies
Code. note 42

     Any one of those three weapons -- antitrust, antidumping, or
countervailing duties -- is sufficient to bankrupt a business that
depends on the market distortions it forbids.  Against that risk
the only practical strategy of the Mexican entrepreneur is to
analyze -- candidly, carefully and in advance -- the extent to
which a project will involve such distortions.  If the project is
likely to be successfully challenged under antitrust law, it is
better never initiated.  If the project is vulnerable to
antidumping or countervailing duties, those duties and the ensuing
cost of fighting a challenge must be factored into the budget.

                Familiar Foes

     Not all of the legal problems of the U.S. market are cultural
shocks to the Mexican entrepreneur.  There are four familiar ones.

Federal Income Tax

     One is federal income taxation.  On this subject the legal
systems of Mexico and the United States are conceptually similar
and converging in corporate rates, with income in top corporate
brackets now being taxed at 35 percent in Mexico and 34 percent in
the United States.

     For Mexican investors, the most significant recent change in the
U.S. fiscal system was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which not only
reduced U.S. rates dramatically but, by adding a "dividend
equivalent tax," note 43 reversed the structural rule-of-thumb for
Mexican investment in the United States.  Previously, because the
United States had a 30 percent tax on dividends paid abroad but no
corresponding tax on the remittance of branch profits, the best
corporate structure for investors (like Mexicans) unprotected by a
general tax treaty with the United States was usually the U.S.
branch of a corporation incorporated outside the United States.
Given the dividend equivalent tax of the 1986 Act, for investors
without treaty protection there is now a 30 percent tax not only on
dividends paid abroad but also on annually remittable branch
profits.  Consequently, the typical tax structure for Mexican
investment in the United States has become a subsidiary corporation
incorporated in the United States.

     The liveliest current tax issue between Mexico and the United
States is their negotiation of a general income tax treaty.
Presently their only tax treaty relationships cover shipping and
aircraft earnings note 44 and the exchange of information. note 45
As compared with competitors from nations that have full tax
treaties with the United States, that leaves Mexican investors
disadvantaged by the tax of 30 percent on dividends, interest,
royalties and rent paid abroad, which for treaty-protected
recipients is reduced to rates as low as 15 percent or zero.

Trademarks

     The second element of the U.S. legal landscape familiar to the
Mexican entrepreneur is trademarks.  Unfortunately they are so
familiar that sometimes they are ignored.  A surprising number of
Mexican investment projects have been disadvantaged by failure to
establish, in advance, proprietary name-identification of their
products in the United States.

Customs

     For Mexican exporters, the third familiar element of U.S. law is
that traditional hobgoblin of transnational traders, la aduana.  As
a checkpoint and duty-exacter, U.S. Customs functions much as
tariff-collectors do in other countries.  To cope with it, the
exporter's best technique is to shadow-box his entries in advance
with an experienced customs broker, making mock-ups of intended
shipping documents and thus avoiding unpleasant surprises.  Besides
import duties, U.S. Customs also enforces a myriad of federal laws,
from country-of-origin markings to the massive remedies of Section
337 note 46 against "unfair practices" in trade.  If achieved, a
North American Free Trade Agreement will eventually eliminate U.S.
import duties, and perhaps some Customs-enforced penalties, on
Mexican products.

Foreign Investment Restrictions

     The fourth foe for Mexican business in the United States is
restrictions on foreign investment.  Here the paradox is that in
recent years, while Mexican foreign investment rules were moving
from protectionism to permissiveness, U.S. foreign investment rules
were changing in the opposite direction.

     Mexico's present foreign investment restrictions began with the
piecemeal ownership restrictions of a 1944 executive decree of
President Avila Camacho.  They crested in President Echeverria's
protectionist 1973 Investment Law and were significantly liberal-
ized by the 1989 Regulations of President Salinas.  If rumors can
be trusted, that liberalization may soon be institutionalized by
formal amendment of the 1973 Law.

     The United States, by contrast, has traditionally welcomed
foreign investment.  There are specific statutes that favor U.S.
suppliers for government procurement and restrict foreign
management or ownership in such sensitive areas as banking, trans-
portation, communication, energy and fisheries, but until recently
the only really pervasive U.S. foreign investment statutes were
aimed not at restriction but merely at disclosure.  Those statutes
were the International Investment Survey Act of 1976 note 47 and
periodic "benchmark" legislation, under which significant foreign
acquisitions and related transactions must be reported
confidentially to the Department of Commerce, and the Agricultural
Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978, note 48 which requires
detailed public disclosure to the Department of Agriculture of
foreign acquisitions of farm land.

     More recently, however, fear of foreign takeovers has eroded the
permissiveness of the United States toward foreign investment.
Scrutiny of the economic position of foreign investors prompted the
1980 Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, note 49 and the
1986 dividend equivalent tax, note 50 each of which eliminated
federal income tax advantages for foreign investors.  In 1988 came
the Exon-Florio provision, note 51 which authorizes the President
to suspend or prohibit any merger, acquisition or takeover by a
foreign person if, in the President's judgment, that foreign person
"might take action that threatens to impair the national security."
The relevant procedures are now enshrined in Treasury regulations
note 52 that provide a voluntary notice and 30-day review period --
in effect, an advisory ruling mechanism -- for concerned foreign
investors.  The President's nullification power has been sparingly
used, but it is largely discretionary and constitutes a hurdle
Mexican investors must not ignore.

     The same restrictive trend is seen in the Foreign Bank
Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991, note 53 which subjects any
U.S. branch or office of a foreign bank to prior approval by the
Federal Reserve Board as well as the Comptroller of the Currency
and any state regulatory body, and reduces to five percent the
level of foreign investment in a U.S. bank that is subject to
Federal Reserve approval.

                Structural Guidelines

     Mindful of the cultural shocks and familiar foes of the U.S.
market, what guidelines does a Mexican business follow in
structuring an investment beyond the river?

Limiting Liability

     The investing corporation shields its Mexican assets against the
litigiousness of the U.S. market, as best it can, by creating a
firewall of corporate and contractual insulation between the parent
group in Mexico and the subsidiary that manufactures, distributes
or otherwise operates in the United States.  Then it adds the
further safeguard of product liability insurance adequate to the
costly jury verdicts of the United States.

Tax Planning

     The second guideline is tax planning.  When a Mexican business
crosses the Rio Grande it anticipates all the taxes it will face on
each side of the border and minimizes them by correlating those
taxes as aggregates and offsetting them against each other, as much
as possible, by foreign tax credits.  The impending negotiation of
a general Mexico-U.S. income tax treaty is encouraging, but until
such a treaty is firmly in place its possibility only increases the
variables.  Meticulous advance tax planning is essential to the
success of any Mexican investment in the United States.

State Strategy

     Legally, the United States is divided into fifty parts, the
states; and the market of each must be won by a strategy of
separate compliance with its distinctive laws.  The U.S. market is
conquered state by state.

Discerning Differences

     The last guideline is that of discerning differences.  The
Mexican investor must be continually alert to the unique demands of
the U.S. legal environment.  Some of those demands -- antitrust,
for example -- have little analogue in Mexico; they must be learned
and respected as new creatures.  Others, such as trademarks and
customs duties, must not be ignored just because their names and
functions are similiar to those of Mexico.

     Applying those four guidelines, the typical Mexican investment
in the United States will be structured as a separate, locally
incorporated subsidiary.  Its contractual relations with its
Mexican parent will be designed to insulate the parent from
commercial presence in the United States and to coordinate their
respective profit centers in a manner to credit and reduce taxes.
The subsidiary will confirm its trademark registrations and customs
classifications prudently in advance and will plan its U.S. market
expansion state by state.  Proposed acquisitions will be checked
against foreign investment restrictions, cleared under Hart-Scott-
Rodino and Exon-Florio if relevant, and reported to the Department
of Commerce and the Department of Agriculture as applicable.  After
that, full speed ahead.

NAFTA May Bring New Opportunities

by Douglas Karmin


     One of the main goals of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) is to expand trade among the member nations.  NAFTA is
intended to reduce the tariffs on goods and services traded among
the three members (Canada, Mexico, and the United States).  The
financial services sector has received a great deal of attention
during the NAFTA negotiations in part because it has historically
been one of the most protected and regulated industries in North
America.  This articles examines how the NAFTA would liberalize the
financial services sector in Mexico and the potential impact this
would have on U.S. banks, insurance companies, and securities
firms.  Throughout the article, the potential beneficiaries of
Mexico's liberalization will be referred to as firms and investors
in Canada and the United States.  In the agreement, this is defined
as firms established in either country, even if they are owned by
non-North American investors.

     This article focuses solely on the expansion of American
financial services into Mexico.  The reason for this is that Canada
already liberalized its financial services market under the 1988
Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).  This article also does not
address the contentious issues involved in liberalizing the United
States' financial services.  Canada and Mexico want to be exempt
from the Glass-Steagall and McFadden Acts which restrict a bank's
ability to own stock in other financial institutions and to conduct
interstate banking.  These restrictions are largely independent
from the issues involved in liberalizing Mexico's industries, and
therefore will not be analyzed here.

     Before examining the potential changes the NAFTA would bring to
U.S. financial services in Mexico, a distinction should be made
between business growth and employment.  Financial services
industries are known for employing relatively small numbers of
workers for a given amount of capital invested.  The U.S.
International Trade Commission reported that, with the exception of
marketing and sales positions, employment figures are declining in
many of the financial services. note 1  This is due in part to the
high degree of automation that is used in these industries.  When
expanded opportunities in Mexico for U.S. financial service
industries are discussed here, it should be kept in mind that the
corresponding increases in U.S. employment would not be nearly as
large as those in the manufacturing or other sectors.

                U.S. Investment and Operations in Mexico

     International trade in services usually requires the exporter to
invest in the foreign nation since the services are usually
provided directly to foreign customers.  Therefore, the investment
climate in a foreign country is crucial to foreign service
providers who want to enter the market.  And the investment climate
in Mexico was not very attractive during the 1980s because Mexico's
large foreign debt, poor infrastructure and communications system,
and high rate of inflation served as deterrents to foreign invest-
ment.

     The recent reforms under President Salinas as well as the
anticipation of a NAFTA have give a boost to investors' confidence.
The Journal of Commerce reported in June 1992 that U.S. investors
held approximately US$27 billion of the US$130 billion capitaliza-
tion in the Mexican equity market. note 2  Financial services,
while still heavily protected and regulated, have been a part of
this increase in foreign investment.  By the end of 1991, there
were 190 foreign financial institutions either represented by
individual banks or sharing banking offices in Mexico. note 3

     In acquiescing to the U.S. and Canadian demands to liberalize
its financial sector under the NAFTA, Mexico is also pursuing its
own economic interests.  Foreign competition in banking, insurance,
and securities will provide some of the resources needed for Mexico
to expand economically.  Foreign firms might also force Mexican
financial services to become more efficient in order to compete.
But at the same time, Mexico is very concerned that foreign firms,
due to their higher level of efficiency and capital reserves, will
drive Mexican firms out of business.  This could jeopardize
Mexico's financial sovereignty, particularly in the banking sector.
Mexico's Commerce Secretary and chief trade representative, Jaime
Serra Puche, summed up his nations' concerns when addressing the
Mexican Senate: "The negotiation of financial services has been
guided by two central objectives.  First, to maintain predominant
Mexican control of the financial system.  Second, to design an
opening that reinforces the economy's competitiveness." note 4

                Banking

     The Mexican banking industry has undergone many structural
changes in the last decade.  In 1982, responding to the foreign
debt crisis, President Lopez Portillo nationalized Mexico's
eighteen banks.  But under the leadership of President Salinas,
Mexico has successfully reversed that action.  All eighteen banks
had ben sold to Mexican investors by July 1992.  Foreign investors
were ineligible to participate in the sealed bid auctions.

     Part of the reason for the privatization movement was the
inefficiency of Mexico's state-run banks.  Lack of foreign
competition also hampered the industry's progress since Citibank is
the only foreign bank allowed to have commercial operations in
Mexico.  Citibank established operations in Mexico in 1929, before
most of the regulations barring foreign banks were created. note 5

Past Restrictions

     In December 1989, Mexico issued new banking regulations that
permitted foreign investors to own 34 percent of the equity in
Mexican banks, but foreign involvement was restricted to nonvoting
participation. note 6  A second wave of banking reforms was
implemented in July 1990.

     Under this new system, 51 percent of Mexican bank equity was
labeled as "A" shares and auctioned off to Mexican financial
institutions like the state development banks and the development
trust funds.  The remaining "B" shares were auctioned off to
institutional investors and Mexican companies as well as the
financial institutions eligible for the "A" shares.  "A" and "B"
shareholders could in turn sell some of their shares to virtually
any investor, including foreigners, as long as these "C" shares
were limited to 30 percent of the bank's total equity. note 7

     Another restriction limited individual investors and single
companies, both foreign and Mexican, to owning only five percent of
any bank.  This limit could be raised to ten percent with special
authorization. note 8

     The "C" shares that were permitted under the 1990 reform gave
foreign investors for the first time a voting stake in bank
operations.  Still, foreign investors did not flood the Mexican
market, in part because they were not interested in operating such
a small fraction of the controlling interest in Mexican banks.

     An even greater obstacle to foreign investment, this one
concerning foreign banks operating in Mexico, was the regulation
that prohibited foreign bank subsidiaries from offering services to
Mexican citizens.  They were only permitted to provide "offshore"
banking services. note 9

Proposed Liberalization Under NAFTA

     In late June 1992, it was reported that Mexico, the United
States, and Canada had reached a compromise on the financial
services sector of the NAFTA that would dramatically liberalize
Mexico's banking industry.  The agreement would allow U.S. and
Canadian investors to own 100 percent of Mexican banks, subject to
the restriction that no more than eight percent of the entire
Mexican banking industry is owned by foreigners within the first
year after a NAFTA is signed.  This eight-percent limit would be
raised one percent per year, each year for seven years, at which
time the limit would be completely removed. note 10  For the first
four years after the limit is removed, Mexico would reserve the
right to freeze U.S. and Canadian investment if it reached 25
percent of the Mexican banking industry.  This 25-percent freeze
could only last three years. note 11  Any further restrictions
beyond this transition period would require the approval of U.S.
and Canadian officials.

     The compromise limits individual investors to only 1.5 percent
of the market during the transition period.  After the transition
period has ended, individual investors would still be limited to
four percent of the market share if the four percent was achieved
by acquiring Mexican banks. note 12  This stipulation was designed
to protect Mexico's largest banks from foreign takeover.
Individual investors from Canada and the United States could expand
beyond this four percent limit, but only through internal
growth. note 13

     The NAFTA also addresses the issue of what kinds of banking
services U.S. firms could provide.  Under the agreement, U.S. and
Canadian subsidiaries in Mexico would receive national treatment
and therefore be allowed to provide all the services that Mexican
banks provide.  U.S. and Canadian banks operating outside Mexico
would still be restricted to providing "offshore" services only.

Prospects for U.S. Industry after Liberalization

     A fall in Mexican interest rates, coupled with the boost in
economic confidence that the NAFTA should provide, is expected to
spur borrowing in Mexico.  This possibility has led many to
speculate that the financial services agreement under the NAFTA
could give a strong boost to the U.S. banking industry.  But the
international position of U.S. banks must be taken into account
when analyzing the potential impact of the NAFTA.  A 1991 U.S.
International Trade Commission (ITC) report concluded:

     If U.S. banks are allowed to offer a full range of financial
     services and products directly in the Mexican market, there
     could be a moderately positive impact on U.S. banking services
     exports to Mexico in the long term.  However, U.S. banks are
     currently consolidating their international operations in
     response to large outstanding loans and higher capital
     requirements which will weaken their ability to enter the
     Mexican market. note 14

     Analysts have also cautioned that the relative size of the
Mexican market, even with rapid growth, is such that the short-run
impact on the revenues of U.S. banks is likely to be small.  A
recent study by Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott shows that in 1989
sixteen of Mexico's banks collectively had assets worth
approximately US$58 billion, one-fourth the size of Citicorp's
assets for the same year. note 15  In the long-run, however,
proponents of the NAFTA argue that the prospects for U.S. banks
look more promising.  Not only is Mexico's economy likely to grow
under the NAFTA and thus provide greater demand for banking
services, but it is possible that U.S. banking operations in Mexico
could be used as a way of expanding services throughout Latin
America.

     In regards to the type of banking operations most likely to be
undertaken, the ITC speculated in its report that commercial
banking would be the focus of U.S. investment rather than retail
banking. note 16  This is because retail banks must reach
individual consumers and therefore require larger capital
investments.

                Insurance

     Despite the fact that there are forty-three Mexican insurance
companies, this sector is widely considered the weakest of Mexico's
financial services. note 17  And unlike banking, the Mexican
insurance industry has a fairly large foreign presence.  Twelve of
the world's twenty-five largest insurance firms, including American
CIGNA and AIG, provide reinsurance and consulting services in
Mexico. note 18  These foreign firms make up approximately 15
percent of the Mexican market share.

Past Restrictions

     Similar to the banking industry, Mexico took steps even before
the NAFTA negotiations to liberalize its restrictions on foreign
involvement in the insurance industry.  Most significantly, in 1990
Mexico lifted its ban on new foreign investment in the insurance
sector and raised the limit of foreign ownership from 15 percent to
49 percent of Mexican insurance companies. note 20

     Despite these changes in regulations on ownership, there still
exist many insurance services that are reserved solely for Mexican
firms.  For example, only national firms are allowed to sell
policies to individuals living in Mexico at the time when the
contract is signed.  National firms also have a legal monopoly on
auto insurance for cars that are owned by Mexican citizens or have
Mexican license plates.  Another examples is the insurance of
imported and exported goods, which is restricted to Mexican firms
if a Mexican resident is liable for the risk.  Credit insurance and
civil liability policies have similar restrictions. note 21

Proposed Liberalization under NAFTA

     The financial services agreement reached in June 1992 would call
for major changes in Mexico's insurance industry.  U.S. and
Canadian insurance companies that are already in Mexico would see
their limitations on ownership in Mexican companies raised from 49
percent to 100 percent by 1996. note 22  The authors conclude that
this is indicative of an industry that is maintaining high
profitability in a protected market despite poor efficiency.
Liberalization of the insurance sector would therefore seem like a
great opportunity for the much more efficient U.S. companies to
expand their operations.

     Still, the Mexican insurance market has the same relatively
small size (when compared to the U.S. market) as the Mexican
banking market.  Insurance premiums represent only one percent of
GDP in Mexico, compared to 9.1 percent in the United
States. note 26  It is unclear whether the small size of the
Mexican market is due to lack of demand or supply or both, but if
it is lack of supply, then it is likely that U.S. insurance
companies could enjoy profitable growth opportunities in Mexico.

                Securities

     The securities and brokerage industry is considered by many to
be Mexico's strongest financial service sector.  Mexico has twenty-
five brokerage houses that provide its investment services.  These
brokerage houses have four main areas of operation, with by far the
largest one being securities agents and traders on the secondary
market.  Two other areas are brokering and mutual fund
administration.  There also exists investment banking divisions in
some of the brokerage houses. note 27  But the size of these
brokerage firms should not be overstated.  The Hufbauer and Schott
study examined seventeen of these firms in 1989 and found that they
had a collective net worth of approximately US$1 billion.  By
comparison, in that same year Merrill Lynch alone had a net worth
over US$3 billion. note 28

Past Restrictions

     The brokerage houses have probably the strictest regulations on
foreign ownership among the financial services.  Foreign investors
in brokerage houses must receive permission from Mexico, and the
total amount of foreign ownership in any one firm is limited to 30
percent.  In addition, no individual foreign investor may hold more
than ten percent of a Mexican brokerage house. note 29

Proposed Liberalization under NAFTA

     The financial services compromise would allow U.S. and Canadian
securities firms to control 10 percent of the Mexican market as
soon as the NAFTA goes into effect.  This limit would be raised to
twenty percent during the first six years of the agreement.  If,
after this six-year transition period, the U.S. and Canadian market
share reaches 30 percent, Mexico can put a freeze on further
foreign investment during a second transition period.  This 30-
percent freeze could only be started during years seven through ten
of the NAFTA and could last at most, three years once Mexico
decides to implement it. note 30

     Individual foreign-owned securities firms would be restricted to
four percent of the market during both stages of the transition
period, which would be a maximum of thirteen years if Mexico
invoked the three-year freeze in the tenth  year of the agreement.
At the end of both transition periods, the limit on individual
market share would be lifted, as would the aggregate limit of 30
percent. note 31

Prospects for U.S. Industry after Liberalization

     Since the securities industry in Mexico is the most regulated of
the financial services, some argue that the U.S. securities
industry has the most to gain from the NAFTA.  U.S. securities
firms have competed successfully in other unregulated markets due
in part to their relative size, sophistication, and reputation.
The industry was quite pleased with the compromise of late June.
In addition to the liberalized Mexican market that this compromise
would create, industry representatives are also fairly optimistic
about the prospects of expanding operations beyond Mexico and into
Latin America, though such an expansions would not be as easy as
spreading throughout the European Community.

     There are, however, a couple of reasons why a liberalization of
Mexico's securities regulations might not have a major impact on
U.S. firms.  First, the relative poverty of the average Mexican
citizen and the small level of capital funds of Mexican companies
may limit the demand for services from U.S. securities firms.
Industry representatives hope that the NAFTA will boost Mexican
wealth in the long run and thus improve the opportunities for these
U.S. firms.  Second, some financial services that fall under the
rubric of the securities industry do not require foreign direct
investment.  For example, most of the transborder business that
U.S. investment banks conduct with Mexico entails Mexican clients
coming to the United States for services.  Under these
circumstances, liberalizing Mexican market access is not going to
significantly improve the business opportunities of U.S. investment
banks.  There are, however, other types of securities services
(e.g., financial advisors, brokerage firms) which are more
dependent on foreign direct investment and therefore would stand to
gain from Mexican liberalization.

                Conclusion

     Despite the transition periods that Mexico has insisted upon
before completely liberalizing its financial service sectors, the
recent NAFTA negotiations appear to be a major victory for U.S.
financial service firms.  For the first time Mexico is permitting
majority ownership by foreign companies in these sectors, as well
as allowing U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries to provide services that
previously had been restricted to Mexican firms.

     On the whole, U.S. banks, insurance companies, and securities
firms are expected to compete very effectively in a liberalized
Mexican market.  The combination of experience, resource size,
reputation, and technical expertise gives U.S. financial service
firms a distinct advantage over their North American competitors.
However, U.S. firms could face stiff competition from Japanese and
European firms that are already established in North America and
therefore eligible for preferential treatment from Mexico.  Since
most major Japanese and European financial service firms are
established in North America, this sector could become the most
open and competitive market addressed in the agreement.

     It appears that the main obstacle to the expansion of U.S.
financial services in a liberalized Mexican market is the size and
income level of Mexico's businesses and citizens.  This obstacle
could be diminished by accelerated Mexican growth once the NAFTA is
implemented.  As is the case with many industries, the United
States might export more financial services to Mexico as it expands
economically.

Ringing Up Credit Cards Sales

     In July 1992, there were 9.6 million credit card accounts in
Mexico.  The credit card market is a rapidly expanding part of the
financial services sector in Mexico and is expected to continue its
growth in the near future.  Two banks, Banamex and Bancomer, along
with a consortium of thirteen banks called CARNET, control
virtually the entire market.  American Express plays an important
role in the service card market.

                Laws and Oversight

     The credit card industry falls under the Ley de Instituciones de
Credito (Credit Institutions Law) of 1990.  The industry is
regulated by the Bank of Mexico and the Comision Nacional de Bancos
(the National Banking Commission).  Only diversified banks may
issue credit cards.  This excludes credit unions and specialized
banks such as Mexico's agricultural and development banks.

                Card Issuers

     Through July 1992, Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, was the
leading issuer of credit cards, with approximately four million
accounts out of a total of 9.6 million in Mexico.  The consortium
CARNET, whose largest member is Banca Serfin, was second with three
million accounts.  Bancomer was the third largest issuer with 2.6
million accounts.

     As in the U.S., American Express issues service, not credit
cards, and usually requires its cardholders to pay off their entire
balance each month; thus American Express is exempted from the
restriction on card issuance by non-banks.  As of August 1992,
American Express had approximately 400,000 cardholders in Mexico.
Diner's Club and several department stores issue their own cards,
but they represent a small part if the market.

     Bancomer issues Visa cards and CARNET and Banamex issue both
Visa cards and Mastercards.  Banks pay the U.S.-based Visa and
Mastercard organizations a licensing fee to issue cards in Mexico.

                Card Billings and Market Strategies

     A total of US$12.3 billion was charged on bank credit cards in
1991.  During the first seven months of 1992, US$8.6 billion was
charged.  In spite of Banamex's lead in charge accounts, each of
the group's share of annual credit card charges is roughly the
same.  Through July 1992, Banamex and Bancomer each controlled
slightly over a third of Mexico's credit card charges and CARNET
just under a third.

     In addition to bank credit card billings, American Express
billed about US$1.0 billion in the first seven months of the year
and projects its billings will reach US$1.7 billion for the entire
year.  American Express's Mexican customers charge an average of
US$5,000 a year on the standard green card, double the amount of
their U.S. counterparts.

     Banamex aims at the mass market, trying to get its cards into
the hands of as many people as possible.  Bancomer, by offering
more services and by charging more for its cards, aims for a
clientele that has greater economic resources.  CARNET, because it
is a consortium of banks, does not have a set strategy; rather,
each bank sets its own market goals.  American Express gears its
card toward the highest income groups.  According to the head of
the Mexican subsidiary, American Express aims solely at the upscale
card market.  In the beginning of 1992, in fact, American Express
canceled 40,000 accounts, about ten percent of outstanding accounts
at the time, because of credit problems and because these
cardholders no longer met American Express's income requirements.

                Credit Card Loan Portfolios

     Credit card loans have become an increasingly important
component of banks' loan portfolios.  Banamex's credit card
portfolio grew in real terms between December 1989 and December
1991 from about US$1.0 billion to US$2.0 billion.  (Real growth is
calculated by factoring out inflation from the peso, then
converting totals into US$ using the peso/dollar exchange rate
prevailing in December 1991.)  At the same time, these loans grew
from eight percent to eleven percent of the bank's total outstand-
ing loans.  Bancomer's credit card loan portfolio more than doubled
in real terms between December 1989 and December 1991, from US$850
million to US$2.0 billion.  During this period, credit card loans
grew from 7.6 percent to 11.3 percent of its total outstanding loan
portfolio.  Bancomer reports that its credit card loans through
December 1991 constituted the most profitable segment of its loan
portfolio.  Figures were unavailable for CARNET.

                Revenue Sources

     Credit card issuers make money from three primary sources:  i)
the annual fee they charge customers for the card; ii) the amount
they charge merchants to process a transaction; and iii) the
interest charged to customers who do not pay off their monthly
balances.  Among banks, card fees range from 45,000 pesos (US$15)
for Bancomer's standard card to 200,000 pesos (US$75) for
Bancomer's high-income gold card.

     Banks charge merchants a fee of up to six percent of the gross
amount of each sale charged to a credit card issued by the bank and
offer discounts to merchants that do a high-volume of credit card
sales.  The day after the transaction, the banks pay the merchant
the entire value of the sale minus the bank's commission.  The
banks do not gain from a float -- i.e., from holding money in an
interest-bearing account and paying the merchants later.  In fact,
banks suffer a "negative float" -- that is, banks pay the merchants
before the banks have received payment from the cardholders for the
items charged and must absorb the cost of money until they are paid
by the cardholders.  Much of this funding cost is offset by the
commission the banks charge the merchants.

     For banks though, the most lucrative feature of issuing credit
cards is the interest they charge cardholders on unpaid balances.
Banks would lose money on their card operations if a significant
number of people did not use the revolving credit feature of the
cards.  In September 1992, banks charged a monthly rate of 3.25
percent interest (39 percent annual rate) on outstanding balances.
The rate charged on unpaid credit card balances is set monthly by
the Bank of Mexico, and is based on the banks' average cost of
raising funds, called the CPP, plus a profit spread for the banks.
In September 1992, the interest rate charged on unpaid balances of
39 percent provided banks a net annualized gain of almost 19
percent over the CPP rate of 20.16 percent.  A balance is outstand-
ing if unpaid 20 days after the billing date.

     Industry-wide, approximately 70 percent of monthly credit card
balances are left unpaid.  One indication of why so much is left
unpaid each month comes from a northern Mexico newspaper (El Norte)
survey which in July 1992 found that 68 percent of cardholders were
oblivious to the interest they were paying on their balances.

     In contrast to banks, American Express derives its credit card
revenues primarily from the fees it charges for its cards and from
what it charges merchants.  The standard green card costs US$66 and
the higher-income gold card costs US$165.

     American Express's charges to merchants depend on the payment
schedule the merchant select and the Mexican short-term treasury
bill interest rate.  For example, in September 1992, a supermarket
would pay American Express a 3.1 percent commission if it wanted to
be paid for purchases made on the American Express card within
seven days and 2.5 percent if it chose the 21-day payment option.
American Express does not offer next-day payment to merchants, but
its fees are generally lower than those of other card companies.
American Express also requires its cardholders to pay off their
balances within 11 days of billing, thus reducing the time the
company must extend credit to its customers.

     American Express does offer credit to its cardholders for
purchases over two million pesos (US$654), but as of September 1992
it charged an annual interest rate of 72.6 percent for this
feature.  Only 12 percent of purchases on the American Express card
are made this way.  As a separate matter, as of early September
1992 American Express charged a punitive annual interest rate of
125.4 percent for all delinquent payments.

                Loan Defaults

     Credit card companies lose money primarily through defaults.
Industry contacts indicate that industry-wide, that part of the
banks' credit card loan portfolios that is past due or
non-performing is about seven percent of outstanding loans.

     In March 1991, the Ministry of Finance adopted new rules for the
establishment of loan loss reserves by Mexican commercial banks.
The rules established five categories, corresponding to the degree
of probability that the loan would be repaid; the riskier the loan,
the higher the reserve.  Under this system, for example, Bancomer
in 1991 placed loan loss reserves of 41.5 percent against its total
past due loan portfolio.  Specific figures for reserves for past
due credit card loans were unavailable.  Banks may write off a loan
only with approval from the National Banking Commission after
demonstrating that they have made sufficient attempts to collect
the loan.

                Applying for and Holding a Credit Card

     Cards available in Mexico range from those only for use within
Mexico to those internationally-acceptable, with corresponding
credit limits and income requirements.

Applying for a Card

     All banks and American Express require proof of local address,
the last two salary statements, and a photo identification.
Banamex requires, in addition, a letter of employment and three
years of employment history.  Bancomer also requires family and
personal references.

     The companies usually do an in-house credit check and, when
necessary, submit the application to Cicsa, Mexico's only credit
bureau.  American Express does most of its credit verification
itself.  All issuers reported that each person's credit history is
verified, usually through phone calls, before they approve
applications.

     American Express rejects approximately 50 percent of its
applicants, mostly for lack of adequate income.  Bancomer rejects
only five percent of its applicants, usually for incomplete or
false data.  Neither Banamex nor CARNET would divulge this
information.

Cards and Cost

     Table I provides a sample of the least and most expensive cards
available and the minimum salary requirements to qualify for one.
American Express's cards are the most expensive, followed by
Bancomer's cards.  American Express also has the highest salary
requirement.

Services and Bill Paying

     Credit card providers in Mexico offer services similar to those
available from providers in the U.S.  These include access to
automatic tellers for cash advances, automatic travel insurance,
and card replacement.  Visa, Mastercard, and American Express
cardholders are connected to the international networks of those
firms.  In addition, Mexican holders of credit cards issued by
banks may use their accounts as savings accounts.  Banks pay a
market interest rate on positive balances.

     Most bank credit card bills are paid in the offices of the banks
that issued the card.  American Express bills are paid in American
Express offices.  Some customers pay their accounts by mail but
because of the unreliability of this method, most choose to pay in
person.  Banamex is beginning a phone payment system in which a
customer can transfer funds from a bank account to pay the bill.

                Market Growth

     The credit card market has grown significantly over the past few
years.  From 1990 to 1991 alone, total charges on bank credit cards
grew over 30 percent in nominal terms.  Charges on the American
Express card were up 27 percent in nominal terms over the same
period.

     Card companies expect the growth to continue through 1992 and
1993, although not as quickly as in the past two years.  Because of
the privatization of the Mexican banks, competition within the
industry is becoming more intense.  Still, CARNET and Banamex plan
for nominal growth of 10 to 20 percent a year in both billings and
card issuance through 1993.  American Express expects 20 percent
nominal annual growth in its card and billing portfolio through
1993.

     This growth is possible both because there are people who meet
the income criteria for cards but do not yet have a credit card and
because increasing incomes for some Mexicans could soon qualify
them for a credit card.  American Express reports that the number
of Mexicans who meet its income criteria is between  1.3  and  1.7
million.   Banamex would not provide an estimate of a target
market, but asserted that the free trade agreement with the U.S.
and Canada and increasing economic modernization in Mexico will
raise personal incomes making more people eligible for credit
cards.

American Express-Banamex Joint Venture

     In March 1992, American Express and Banamex announced a
joint-venture called Banamsa to issue American Express gold cards.
American Express expects to issue 300,000 of these co-branded cards
by 1995, in addition to the 400,000 American Express cards already
issued in Mexico.  American Express's primary aims in this venture
are to gain access to Banamex's six million customers and to its
network of roughly 725 branches.  This will make it easier for
customers to pay bills and for merchants to receive payment.  In
addition, American Express hopes to extend the market for its
corporate card through Banamex's relationship with businesses.
Banamex expects to gain access to American Express's expertise in
the travel industry and to its international financial experience.

                NAFTA

     Under NAFTA, foreign non-bank financial services companies will
be permitted to set up limited-scope financial institutions in
Mexico, including those to provide credit card services.  The total
assets of these companies are limited to three percent of the total
assets of all commercial banks in Mexico plus the total assets of
all limited-scope financial institutions in Mexico.  A change in
Mexican law would be required for non-banks to be able to issue
credit cards in Mexico.  It is expected that this change will occur
as part of the implementing legislation for NAFTA.
