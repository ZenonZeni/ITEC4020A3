<title>Internal Combustion Engine Efficiency Has Improved</title>

<H3>1. Internal Combustion Engine Efficiency Has Improved</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Only about 13 percent of the energy consumed by today's vehicles actually 
propels them forward.<a href="#255" name="r255"> [ 255 ]</a>
Each year U.S. drivers spend $77 billion on
gasoline and oil for their vehicles - with the bulk of each gallon of 
gasoline discharged through the tailpipe as waste exhaust.<a href="#256" name="r256"> [ 256 ] </a>Much of this 
energy need not be wasted.<BR>
<p>     The increase in automobile fuel efficiency already achieved is an 
important transportation success. The technology exists, however, to 
substantially improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines. The 
most efficient cars now on the road achieve more than 45 miles per gallon 
(mpg). Commercial prototypes boast more than 70 mpg <I>in the city</I>.<a href="#257" name="r257"> [ 257 ] </a>
Technology exists to raise average new-car fuel economy 65 percent, from 
28 to 46 miles per gallon, by 2005. A comparable increase can be made for 
light trucks.<a href="#258" name="r258"> [ 258 ] </a>Phasing these improvements into U.S. cars and light 
trucks over the next 10 years could save 2.8 million barrels of oil per 
day by 2010. These savings are larger than the supplies expected from 
exploiting reserves offshore or in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.<a href="#259" name="r259"> [ 259 ] </a>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>     Because carbon dioxide emissions are proportional to fuel 
consumption, higher fuel economy means lower greenhouse gas emissions. If 
a 6 percent annual improvement trajectory in new vehicle fuel economy is 
started in 1996, annual greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 27 
million metric tons in 2000 and by 152 million metric tons in 2010.<a href="#260" name="r260"> [ 260 ] </a>
<p>     These savings would be on top of substantial progress already 
obtained in integrating energy efficiency into automobiles, including 
passenger cars and light trucks, over the past two decades. Automobiles 
required 40 percent less energy per vehicle-mile in 1990 than in 1970.<a href="#261" name="r261"> [ 261 ] </a>
These efficiency gains are due in large part to technology-forcing 
regulations, especially federal Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) 
standards, as well as greater consumer acceptability and affordability of 
smaller vehicles. Between 1970 and 1990, the annual amount of fuel used 
per automobile declined by 25 percent.<a href="#262" name="r262"> [ 262 ] </a><BR>

 <p>     <B><I><A NAME="HondaMotorsCorporation">Honda Motors Corporation<a>. </B></I>Honda has introduced a 
new high-efficiency Civic HX Coupe that meets the California low-emission 
vehicle (LEV) standard several years before the requirement goes into 
effect. The vehicle's continuously variable transmission (CVT) and 
lean-burn 1.6 liter engine give the vehicle up to 25 percent greater 
mileage over conventional automatics, at an economical price.<a href="#263" name="r263"> [ 263 ] </a>
