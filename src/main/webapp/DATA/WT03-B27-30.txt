<a href="fmc.html"><I><B>The Fred Meyer Challenge</I></B></a>
<H5>
 The Fred Meyer Challenge is the most unique golf tournament of its kind in the country.  Nearly 50,000 people arrive at the prestigious Oregon Golf Club in West Linn, Oregon to watch 24 of the world's greatest golfers compete over two days for a $750,000 purse in the two-man, best-ball format.  Peter Jacobsen serves as host for the annual three-day event, which is televised nationally and internationally.
<P>
The event's one-day Pro-Am preceding regular play brings together PGA Tour stars, top celebrities and amateurs.  It is recognized as one of the most exceptional pro-ams in the country.
<P>
Each year hundreds of <a href="sponsor.html">corporate sponsors</a> participate in The Fred Meyer Challenge because it consistently provides their business with high levels of corporate and product exposure, as well as excellent entertainment.

<H4><I><B>Nike Tour Championship</I></B></H4>
<P>
The NIKE Tour gives aspiring young golfers and former PGA Tour members an opportunity to hone their skills in competitions across the country.  Through 72 holes and four days of grueling competition, the top 50 money winners on the NIKE Tour battle for the rights to be called champion and gain entry into the PGA Tour.
<P>
For two years the NIKE Tour Championship event was held at the highly-touted Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in Cornelius, Oregon.  PJP managed and promoted the NIKE Tour Championship, which took place on the club's challenging Ghost Creek course.

Intense competition characterizes the annual showcase of college basketball talent at the Ford Far West Classic.  A holiday tradition since the 1950s, the University of Oregon and Oregon State University men's basketball teams meet in Portland in December for two nights of doubleheader contests with top NCAA teams from across the nation.  The Ford Far West Classic is one of the oldest and most respected holiday basketball tournaments in America.

Billed as "IceNost," PJP organized and promoted and organized this event bringing 8,000 fans to the Memorial Coliseum in Portland, Oregon to watch the best of the United States and USSR hockey teams.  Team USA played an exhibition game against the Soviet Union National Team in a final tune-up for the Goodwill Games held in Seattle, Washington the following month.  The Soviets came from behind in the third period to win 5-3.  The U.S. team went on to win the Silver Medal in the 1990 Goodwill Games, losing in a dramatic sudden-death shoot out with the Soviets for the Gold Metal.

More than 25,000 spectators attended Portland's first International Outboard Grand Prix (IOGP) racing event held on the Willamette River.

The circuit, sanctioned by the American Power Boat Association, featured three classes of boats (Champ, MOD-VP and SST-140) raced by 50 to 60 teams from the United States, Canada and Europe.
<P>
Corporate sponsor chalets, which lined the northern end of Tom McCall Waterfront Park promenade along the Willamette River, were graced with spectacular viewing of the fast paced, highly competitive race, where boats with up to 300 horsepower engines reached top speeds of 140 mph.
