<P>

Concerns about the availability and financing of health care in the future are the 
primary focus of government and household planning today. For investors, the 
health care debate provides added emphasis to the need for retirement planning 
and the need for investment vehicles to provide for health care expenditures 
associated with retirement funding. 
<P>

Let's review the two different sets of pressures that are forcing today's debate on the 
future of health care.
<P>

Budget deficit reduction at the federal government level is the first pressure. The 
task of reducing federal deficits to somewhere close to balanced over the next seven 
years requires the government to slow down the growth of its spending on health 
care. Programs such as Medicare will still grow but the rate of growth 
must be reduced.  Although the elderly will be responsible for paying higher 
Medicare premiums, their responsibility will equal less than one-third of their 
Medicare bill, with the other two-thirds of the bill continuing to be paid for by taxpayers. 
<P>

Reducing the pace of federal spending on health care, then, means that more of the 
burden of retirees' health care must be borne by retirees themselves. Higher co-payments and alternative ways of delivering health care are among the solutions to 
be considered.
<P>

Demographics are the second pressure forcing the debate. The baby boom will soon 
start its inevitable march into retirement, and this will balloon the demand for 
Medicare services. Certainly the federal taxpayer cannot support the baby boom at 
the same level of retiree health benefits as is being done for the current generation 
of retirees. Future retirees will have to provide more for their own health care. 
<P>

The United States is not alone in insisting on this. The retirement financing burden 
has already forced change in pension programs in Germany and Sweden. As in other 
countries, the political transition can be expected to meet resistance, however. The 
elderly, a strong voting bloc in the U.S., will continue to fight for the preservation of 
retiree benefits, and there are many politicians who are willing to play along in the 
interest of gathering votes. 
<P>

How will health care be funded? Retirement planning has been developed to meet 
funding needs. As a result of federal deficit reduction, the present Baby Boomers 
and Generation Xers need to increase the amount they invest from their current 
income to provide for a retirement that assumes a greater responsibility for their 
health care costs.
<P>

Knowing that their retirement has to provide for everyday living and health care 
expenses, will workers today try to set aside incrementally more for the future? Yes, 
at least that's my expectation. Proposals for expanded Individual Retirement 
Account (IRA) and 401(k) programs also reflect this thinking. The rational 
individual, if he or she wants to enjoy the retirement standard of living that others 
enjoyed before cuts in federal benefits, would be expected to increase investment 
now.  Private funding by individuals must make up the shortfall in public funding for retirement.
<P>

Without increased private funding, the quality of the retirement experience will 
indeed diminish for future retirees. Present retirees benefited from an unusual 
coincidence of generous government benefits, demographics and unexpected 
health care improvements. Future generations will not likely benefit from at least the 
first two. However, we are starting to see some innovations designed with 
tomorrow's retiree in mind.  Through the development of new payment systems and 
pricing policies, health care providers such as hospitals, insurers and doctors also 
have started to alter their means of helping patients finance their health care.
