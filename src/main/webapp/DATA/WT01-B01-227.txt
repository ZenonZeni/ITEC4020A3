<H1>Life at SEA </H1>
<HR>
This section gives you a feel for what it's like to be in a
SEA program from a student's perspective.  As much as possible,
we've tried to let the SEA students speak for themselves through
the <A href="../journals/jrtop.htm">Student Journal entries </A>
they've contributed.  
<BR>
You may also want to have a look at our <A href="../calendar/caltop.htm">
Academic Calendar</A> to see the upcoming schedule of classes, or the
<A href="../faq/faqtop.htm">SEA FAQ's </A> for answers to a list of 
frequently asked questions. To meet the teachers you'll be working with at SEA, take a look 
at the <A HREF="../faculty/facultop.htm">SEA Faculty page</A>.
