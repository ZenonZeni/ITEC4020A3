Air quality, air flows in buildings, and ventilation are most important topics. Good air quality is however critically dependent also on other things than ventilation, eg source strengths, as is well known. The theme of our conference could also lead to the assumption that there is a simple connection between ventilation and air quality. As the public tend to see ventilation systems as responsible for bad air quality, it is important to state that there is no general criterion for good air quality possible to use in practice to control ventilation processes. Automatic ventilation control is still possible in specific cases only. The ventilation process depends on the total air exchange in the building, which is difficult to control. A related question is: what is acceptable as ventilation air? Is air leaking in through the outer wall acceptable? Is air supplied through the staircases acceptable? To answer such questions air quality criteria are needed too.

Adequate ventilation with the "right amount of air, to the right place and at the right time" are important factors for achieving a good indoor climate. Thus it is of prime importance that the ventilation system is working properly. Using traditional methods, it is a very time consuming, and some times even impossible, task to balance ventilation systems to achieve correct air distribution. In most countries the growing concern about Indoor Air Quality has resulted in Building Codes demanding increased ventilation rates. This makes it even more critical that ventilation systems are correctly balanced. Otherwise the effort of solving one problem: "inadequate ventilation", may create two new problems: "draught and noise". This paper describes the "DPM method which is a new method for balancing ventilation systems. The balancing "starts at the designer's desk" by doing a comprehensive computerised pressure loss analysis. The results from this analysis are then input to a PC connected with an electronic instrument. The PC/instrument may be used for balancing when the air terminals are already installed in the building. However, there is a much larger potential for time and cost savings when using the DPM method for pre-setting air terminals at the factory. For this purpose a "DPM machine" has been designed for computerised pre-setting and bar code labelling of air terminals. With impressive results the ventilation systems in a number of buildings have been balanced in the last two years using the described innovative technology.

The effect of recirculation on the age of air is described. A new effectiveness measure called the relative air-change effectiveness is defined in such a way that the air distribution pattern in a room may be quantitatively characterized even when the age of the supply air is non-zero. This admits the evaluation of air distribution patterns in single-zone systems that recirculate air, and also multizone systems with or without recirculation. It is shown that the relative air-change effectiveness may be calculated either solely from age of air measurements of from age of air measurements and flow rate measurements. Re-evaluation of previously published experimental data demonstrates how knowledge of the relative air-change effectiveness may change conclusions drawn from experiments in working buildings.

A condition often assumed when designing a naturally ventilated building is where air enters at low level and leaves at high level due to the stack effect. It then follows that, at upper levels, the air may be relatively 'stale' since it has previously passed through the lower storeys. An analogous situation may arise when wind is blowing, in which the air entering through the windward face becomes stale as it passes through the building to the downwind sections. It is not well understood how ventilation may, in reality, be affected by this. To address these issues, this report describes a modelling approach using BREEZE and complimentary measurements using the Passive Tracer Gas technique to study local ventilation rates in multiroomed office buildings. Calculations show that simple ventilation flow rates, as conventionally calculated at the design stage, cannot be relied upon to indicate the true 'freshness'. Measurements show that effective ventilation can be less than current minimum occupancy requirements.

This paper reports the findings of a pilot field study carried out to investigate the internal and external air pollution levels of two adjacent buildings, one naturally-ventilated and the other air-conditioned in an urban area, to investigate their relative attenuation of external pollution levels and to compare internal levels with existing air quality guidelines. Concentration levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were monitored, Simultaneously, measurements of ventilation rates within the buildings and periodic video recordings of the traffic were also carried out. As expected the concentration of external pollutants in the buildings followed the daily external variation, but at reduced levels. Generally, pollutant levels were higher in the naturally ventilated building than in the air-conditioned building. However, on a number of occasions, combustion products from heating boilers were entrained into the air-conditioned building via the high level air intake of the ventilation system raising the levels of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide inside the building to higher than those found externally. A comparison of the results with existing air quality guidelines or standards for exposure showed that in both buildings the level of contamination was less than the relevant standard, except during a limited period at the weekend when combustion products were possibly entrained into the air-conditioned building. There is thus no clear distinction between the two types of ventilation strategies in terms of providing adequate indoor air quality to the occupants of the buildings.

The aim of this study was to compare the radon levels at workplaces and in homes located nearby. Homes (number of 57) and partly or fully underground workrooms (number of 55) have been studied at the four workplaces in southern Finland and one workplace in northern Finland. Radon concentrations both at workplaces and in homes seemed to be at the same level in the same district. The mean radon concentration in workrooms was 406 Bq.m-3, and in homes concentration was 398 Bq.m-3. At the workplaces having mere exhaust ventilation the mean radon concentration was higher (arithmetic mean of 677 Bq.m-3 n=14), than the places having mechanical exhaust and supply ventilation (arithmetic mean of 207 Bq.m-3, n=33). In an average the naturally ventilated workplaces (n=8) had the lowest level of indoor radon (arithmetic mean of 133 Bq.m-3). The highest radon level, both in the workrooms (2937 Bq.m-3) and in the homes (3080 Bq.m-3), was found in the northern Finland. The high values of indoor radon might be partly explained by the hill-construction of buildings without sealed constructions against soil, and partly by depressurisation caused by mechanical exhaust ventilation.

In the urban environment, there is strong evidence that fine particulates associated with vehicular emissions are linked with respiratory problems and an increase in mortality. The population sector most at risk is the elderly who spend much of their time indoors; consequently, the infiltration of these particles and their subsequent behaviour indoors is of primary concern. The deposition of aerosol particles in the respiratory system and on indoor surfaces is a process governed by particle size; in addition to providing risk assessment data, an understanding of the interaction of particles with indoor surfaces can be applied to the design of systems for enhancing indoor aerosol deposition and thus inhibiting inhalation exposure. This paper describes experiments using tracer-labelled aerosols, in a range of monodisperse size distributions representative of real particulate pollutants, to study aerosol deposition on surfaces with representative roughness. Some preliminary data, exhibiting electrostactically-enhanced aerosol deposition are also presented. In order to make these data widely accessible, the experimental results are used to aid in the development of a CFD code by providing validation data. Simulations are described for a room-sized enclosure with representative indoor surfaces, to illustrate the influence of internal building surface characteristics on indoor aerosol concentration modification.

The present paper presents results from measurements of outdoor airflow rates and air change rates carried out simultaneously with measurements of the indoor concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The measurements were made both under controlled laboratory conditions and in the field. The field experiments were performed in a conference room, an assembly hall and an office room, and laboratory investigation was carried out in a 19 m3 test chamber. CO2 measurements can be successfully used to estimate the outdoor airflow rate in occupied rooms, but it is vital that the methodology takes into consideration a number of possible sources of errors. For example, it can not be presupposed that steady-state conditions prevail. However, inaccuracies due to non steady-state conditions may be reduced by a thorough analysis of the measurement results. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how the air change rate can be determined using a method based on analysis of the CO2-concentration decay in a room.

This study is done by order of a Finnish air cooler manufacturer and it is founded to a master's thesis of the same subject matter. The company produces eg unit air coolers with electric fans and so the aim of the study was to reduce draught problems caused by cold air jets. The desired values were: Because there are two different ways to reach and maintain low temperatures in cold working rooms we first compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods and then get acquainted with cold air jets and reducing draught problems they can cause. The cooling coil can be mounted in the ventilating unit in which case the cold air has to be blown into rooms through ducts and conventional air outlets. Cooling coils can also be mounted directly to the ceiling in cold rooms. In that case there is often used forced convection which is carried out with electric fans. The forced convection improves heat transfer and so it is possible to make coils of compact size. The installation with cooler coils and electric fans is called unit air cooler. The former method makes it possible to have silent cold rooms with good and even distribution. The air distribution can be still improved by using porous textile ducts and let the cold air flow through the cloth into the room. However, there can be some hygienic problems. Hygienic problems can be minimised with the latter method, unit air coolers, because they are quite easy to maintain and keep clean. The disadvantage is that there can be some noise and draught problems. Noise problems can be solved by using fans with low RPM, but the draught problem still remains. It can be reduced with air deflectors which intensify the so-called Coanda effect. The results of this study are utilised in a novel series of air coolers.

AIOLOS is a project partly financed by the European Commission, DG XVII for Energy, within the frame of the ALTENER programme. The purpose of the project is the creation and dissemination of educational material on the use of passive ventilation cooling systems and techniques as applied in buildings. All information will be coupled with the problems of passive solar heating, daylighting and visual comfort. The project is oriented to South European but also North European countries with moderate climate presenting cooling problems. Existing information and knowledge together with recent European research results will be compiled into an educational package. The package will include brochures of case studies, slides, didactic software, technical manuals, guidelines and a handbook with basic and up-to-date knowledge acquired by recent research projects in the field. The aim of the project is to provide building professionals with all necessary knowledge and tools on the efficient use of passive ventilation in buildings. All material will be in a flexible form so that it can be updated on a regular basis. Dissemination will be achieved by seminars attended by building professionals. The overall duration of the project is 18 months.

In response to complaints about poor air quality in bus termini, the Hong Kong Government is considering imposing legislative control over ventilation system design and operation of bus termini in Hong Kong. However, there are, as yet, no relevant air quality criteria and ventilation system design guidelines for Hong Kong. In this paper, measured air quality data for 5 semi-enclosed bus termini are reviewed. This provides a picture of the prevalent air quality in bus termini. To establish a design guide for ventilation systems for Hong Kong, a number of overseas design guides are examined and a ventilation system design method is proposed. The significance of design parameters, such as bus engine emission rates, utilization of the terminus, ventilation effectiveness, etc, are discussed.

This paper presents the special needs and difficulties concerning cooling and ventilation of the SwissMetro high-speed ground transportation system. SwissMetro is based on four complementary technologies: a complete underground infrastructure, a partly evacuated tunnel system to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle with a maximum speed between 400 and 500km/h, linear electric motors and a magnetic levitation and guiding system. Due to high internal and external heat loads permanent cooling and air-conditioning of the vehicle is required. Additional thermal problems may occur in the case of an emergency. The pressure level inside the tunnel has to be raised within a short period of time to guarantee the safety of the passengers and to avoid any health risks. This repressurisation of long tunnel sections may cause shock waves and high temperatures inside the tunnel. The aim of the project is to analyse the spatial and temporal temperature evolution in the SwissMetro tunnels under different conditions and in emergency situations.

A naturally ventilated three level office building has been used to study basic stack ventilation configurations and the interaction between ventilation and the subsequent cooling of the building structure in summer. The research was performed in the framework of a European project on passive cooling of buildings and the objective was to validate simple ventilation algorithms and to give an experimental basis to design guidelines for night cooling techniques. The multilevel office allowed the studying of the influence of openings (size and position) on the neutral pressure level (NPL) and on airflow rates. Various cross-ventilation situations have been studied. A single flow path configuration was obtained by closing all windows and doors in the building envelope with the exception of the roof exhaust and one office window as the ventilation air inlet. Air flow patterns were traced with smoke and tracer gas. In a first set of experiments, where the only driving force is stack pressure, air velocities and the position of the NPL have been measured, and contraction and velocity coefficients as used in the Bernoulli model have been observed. In a second set of experiments, the resulting effective area of a combination of two openings in series was studied. Air flow rates derived from velocity measurements in the open doorways were found to be in agreement with the flow rates obtained with a constant injection tracer gas technique, with an uncertainty of +/-20%. Overall agreement was found between the velocity measurements and simplified models based on the Bernoulli equation. In order to cool multiple levels of a building with outside air, the position of the neutral pressure level should be controlled. The restrictions on opening size and position are discussed.

Low emitting building materials have contributed to the reduction of indoor air contaminants, and in many countries gas ranges and gas cookers are rarely used. As a result, in buildings located in urban environments, a considerable part of the contaminants in the indoor air may originate from the outdoor air. In urban areas buildings are exposed to high concentrations of a large number of contaminants, especially during traffic peak hours. Often, the air intakes are located on the facades, and if there are no filters, the supply air will have the same content of contaminants as the outdoor air adjacent to the buildings. Where if possible, it is advantageous to place the air intakes on the roofs of the buildings (1). The higher the air intakes are placed, the better is the air quality in most cases. To avoid exposure to high concentrations indoors due to concentration peaks of contaminants in the outdoor air, it is possible to decrease the airflow rate temporarily (2). This could be done by monitoring the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO) adjacent to the air intake. When the outdoor concentration of CO exceeds a preset limit, the fans are simply switched off, or the speed of the fans are decreased to a more suitable level.

The paper will discuss problems connected with incorporation of stochastic factors into deterministic models of indoor air quality. Three different methods: * quasi dynamic multi-zone modelling with generating of input data time series, * multi-zone modelling based on the theory of stochastic differential equations, * Monte-Carlo simulation with independent random generating of stochastic parameters, will be shortly presented. Described methods are compared on the base of computer simulation of CO2 concentration in simple two compartment office. The comparison of simulation outcomes shows that the way of stochastic disturbances incorporation into indoor air quality models does not have an important influence on mean value of predicted concentration. At the same time the analysis of standard deviations indicates that the method of disturbances generation and its later incorporation have a great influence on probability distribution of estimated concentrations. The author would like to highlight that differences. The conclusions include also subjective opinion of the author on main advantages and disadvantages of each of proposed methods.

The performance of mechanical ventilation systems has been checked in several innovative residential houses in the frame of Swiss research as well as pilot and demonstration projects. This paper gives a list of performance criteria for the ongoing comparison and evaluation of these mechanical ventilation systems. For some criteria, target values are proposed. In the second part, this paper shortly describes four residential buildings with mechanical ventilation systems where such evaluations were performed and highlights interesting design features and results from the measurements. It then focuses on discrepancies between the design goals and what has been encountered in reality during the evaluation campaign. Problem items were, among others, commissioning, occupant acceptance and window opening behaviour as well as sealing of ducts and heat exchangers.

The comparison of the performance of ventilation systems must take into account different issues. For indoor air quality, different kinds of pollutant sources have to be defined. To make an evaluation of the results, the best approach is to consider the people exposure. Four generic pollutants are taken into account: rooms components or furniture, human metabolism, cooking activities, passive smoking. As the definition of the unit for each pollutant is free, it is useful for their comparison to press them on a common "normalised" basis. This enables to make a distinction between the simulations based on generic pollutants and their interpretation which could be derived for many kinds of pollutants without having to do additional calculations as far as the considered pollutant follows the conventional patterns. The pressure difference, for example can be related to radon issues as to running of some heat appliances. The room parameters are mainly related to humidity issues as condensation, mould growth or house dust mites. For energy issues, a distinction has to be made between the direct energy use (fans) and the heat needs due to ventilation. Such a methodology has been defined within the IEA annex 27 project. After a presentation of the different parameters taken into account, we describe the computer code SIREN95 developed at CSTB in order to obtain the required results and we present a sensitivity analysis for the basic ventilation system used in France (mechanical exhaust).

The study concerns the ventilation of a parallelepiped shaped room by means of several systems whose supplying and extracting methods differ, so the different thermic conditions applied to limits. To qualify the efficiency of each of these systems in relation with the various current criteria, we carried out measurements by means of a tracer gas, both with a transitory and a permanent flow. At the same time, numerical simulations were carried out by means of a CFD code which solves the equations of the fluids mechanic, material and heat transfers associated with flows. These calculations results, after measurements validation, enable to accurately know the air movements in the ventilated room as well as the tracer gas concentrations distribution in the tested configurations. From these calculation results, was also demonstrated how the complex behaviour of each of these ventilation systems can be characterised owing to the possibility of identifying it to a simple model, using a reduced number of parameters. These typical parameters can in turn be used to implement the system performance evaluation criteria. These criteria allow to compare the various studied ventilation systems and class them in performance order. It can be seen that this classification can be modified depending on the selected criterion as well as the chosen ventilated area. The study results equally show the interest of the use of numerical simulation together with experiments, thus extending the range of results in order to generalise conclusions.

The LTEE laboratory of Hydro-Quebec, in collaboration with Canada Mortgage and Housing conducted an indoor air quality study involving 30 single family detached houses heated with electric baseboard heaters in the vicinity of Trois Rivieres during the 1993-94 heating season. The houses were selected according to the measured air leakage at 50 Pa. so as to have a sample distribution similar to the distribution of air leakage of houses in the province of Quebec. The "source strength" of several air pollutants were calculated from measurements of ambient pollutant levels and total ventilation during a one-week test. In addition, the indoor CO2 and humidity levels were recorded in eight of the houses continuously during the heating season. The level of CO2 in the master bedroom was found to follow fairly closely the CO2 level in other parts of the building including the basement (within about 200 ppm) except when the bedroom door was closed. With the room occupied and the door closed, CO2 levels in the bedroom increased steadily during the night until morning, when the door was opened, to levels in excess of 3 500 ppm with one person, and in excess of 4 500 ppm with two persons. Model studies using the measured pollutant source strengths and measured equivalent leakage areas of the buildings indicated that the recommended health guidelines for airborne respirable solid particles (RSP's), CO2 and formaldehyde are exceeded during periods of low total ventilation, coinciding with mild outdoor temperatures and low wind conditions. It was observed that kitchen and bathroom fans originally installed in some of these houses were not operated by the occupants for sufficiently long times to affect the quality of indoor air. Various different methods of ventilating some of the houses were tested, including quiet replacement exhaust fans, mixing fans for indoor air, and a fresh air intake and mixing system. The effects of operating various air handling systems were monitored by keeping track of indoor CO2 and relative humidity in the master bedroom, and occupancy in person-hours per day. Quiet replacement fans noticeably improved indoor air quality when these were operated over 50% to 100% of the time. An area of remaining concern is the fact that exhaust only systems accentuate the negative pressure in the basement by raising the level of the neutral pressure zone in the building, and may enhance the flow of soil gases into the basement. A system which mixed indoor air between the basement and the main floor also reduced the average level of indoor pollutants. The system was designed to create a pressure difference between the main floor and the basement, causing a slight pressurization of the basement. A system designed to introduce 5L/s of outdoor air and to mix it with 55L/s of indoor air for tempering was installed to draw air from the hallway and deliver the mixed air into each of three bedrooms. This system was capable of maintaining CO2 levels in the master bedroom below 1000 ppm with two occupants in the room and the door closed.

The role of ventilation in the housing stock is to provide fresh air and to dilute internally-generated pollutants in order to assure adequate indoor air quality. Energy is required to provide this ventilation service, either directly for moving the air or indirectly for conditioning the outdoor air for thermal comfort. Different kinds of ventilation systems have different energy requirements. Existing dwellings in the United States are ventilated primarily through leaks in the building shell (ie infiltration) rather than by mechanical ventilation systems. This report ascertains, from best available data, the energy liability associated with providing the current levels of ventilation and to estimate the energy savings or penalties associated with tightening or loosening the building envelope while still providing ventilation for adequate indoor air quality. Various ASHRAE Standards (eg 62 119 and 136) are used to determine acceptable ventilation levels and energy requirements. Building characteristics, energy use, and building tightness data are combined to estimate both the energy liabilities of ventilation and its dependence on building stock characteristics. The average annual ventilation energy use for a typical dwelling is about 61 GJ (roughly 50% of total space conditioning energy usage); the cost-effective savings potential is about 38 GJ. The national cost savings potential, by tightening the houses to the ASHRAE Standard 119 levels while sill providing adequate ventilation through infiltration or mechanical ventilation, is $2.4 billion. The associated total annual ventilation energy use for the residential stock is about 4.5EJ (ExaJoules).

The research community as well as the design and construction practice is spending a lot of efforts and investments in developing systems which optimise the energy use for achieving certain specified air flow rates. For example, improvements in efficiencies of 10 % in heat recovery systems would be considered as remarkable. At present, one observes a tremendous difference in the ventilation requirements in various countries as well as at the European level. Variation of a factor 10 of the ventilation rate requirement can be found in the proposal for European standard CEN prENV 1752 depending on the 'cleanness'of the building. The present paper develops these problems and makes a comparison with the situation in other areas like thermal comfort and lighting requirements.

The acceptance and appreciation of ventilation systems is mainly determined by the perceived indoor air quality, thermal comfort and noise. Noise in relation to ventilation systems can be divided into three categories: * outdoor noise (entering the dwelling through ventilation openings, cracks, mechanical supply and exhaust openings etc); * noise generated by components of the ventilation system; * the impact of ventilation systems on sound reduction of partitions (between dwellings, rooms etc). Depending on the type of ventilation system, one or more of these aspects are of concern. Noise related to the ventilation system and components, can result in turning off the ventilation system or closing vents etc. This can have a negative influence on ventilation and indoor air quality. In the framework of IEA ANNEX 27 several noise aspects of domestic ventilation systems have been evaluated. Outdoor noise: In noise loaded areas the selection and the applicability of different types of ventilation systems are determined by the noise level on the facades. A simplified tool is developed to select ventilation systems as a function of the required noise reduction of the facade, room dimensions and design and construction of the facade. System noise: Controlling noise levels caused by ventilation systems is in practice one of the most important factors to contribute to the satisfaction with a ventilation system. Air duct systems in dwellings transport noise generated by fans and aerodynamic noise generated by bends, control valves, grilles etc. ANNEX 27 gives basic formulas to estimate sound power levels of fans and grilles, indication of sizes for silencers and guidelines for design. Impact on noise reduction of partitions: The composite sound reduction is the result of different sound channels from one room to the other. One of these sound channels may be the ventilation system (cross-talk). Cross-talk can be brought about through the air duct system, overflow grilles and ventilation openings in partitions, duct transitions etc. ANNEX 27 provides guidelines for sound reductions of partitions and insertion losses for ducts to eliminate the influence of cross-talk.

To ensure indoor air quality an efficient ventilation system should provide fresh air in those parts of a room where it is required. To assess whether the ventilation system fulfils the main objective, different definitions of local ventilation efficiency (the local mean age of air, the local ventilation rate, the local purging flow rate and the local air exchange rate) are reported in literature. Tracer gas techniques (step up method, step down method and pulse method) and CFD-models are mostly used in research to identify the 3-D distribution of these ventilation parameters in a ventilated space. In our laboratory the 'local volumetric concentration of fresh air flow rate' (m3/s.m3) was introduced as a new ventilation parameter. A total amount of 90 step up experiments was performed in a laboratory test installation with a volume of 9 m3 (3x2x1.5m) to model the 3-D distribution of this ventilation parameter in relation to different values of the ventilation rate (120-300 m3/h) and the heat supply (0-400 Watt) as control inputs. In the main part of the paper some results are given of the modelled 3-D distribution of the 'volumetric concentration of fresh air flow rate' in the test installation. This distribution of fresh air flow rate is assessed in relation to the air flow pattern which is visualised by smoke experiments and quantified by image analysis and the Archimedes number.

Ventilation is necessary to provide a good indoor air quality to occupants in office buildings but is however a major energy consumer. In that manner, ventilation in itself can contribute to much more than 50% of the energy consumption for heating in well insulated office buildings. Likewise, the general trend in standards to augment ventilation requirements would still increase its energy costs. Thus, it seems obvious that an intelligent control of ventilation in office building allows to obtain substantial reductions of energy consumption. To a certain extent this is also true for dwellings even if in general ventilation represents a smaller contribution to the energy consumption for heating than in office buildings. In this connection, it should be noted that the increasing requirements regarding insulation of dwellings has for effect to augment this proportion. Demand controlled ventilation in dwellings appears therefore also as an interesting way to achieve energy consumption reduction.

Many modern buildings in the Nordic countries have mechanical ventilation. Passive stack ventilation is, however, an accepted ventilation system in the Nordic countries according to the current building codes. The building authorities need to be able to supply guidelines on natural ventilation systems in modern buildings, in order to fulfill the requirements on a healthy indoor climate at a reasonable energy cost. Therefore a project was initiated by the Nordic committee on building regulations. The aim of the project was to present functional and technical requirements on natural ventilation systems. The paper discusses the influence of outdoor air vents and airtightness on passive stack ventilation for Nordic dwellings. Calculations, based on measurements, were performed for a one storey one-family house, a 11/2-storey one-family house and two apartments in a three-storey building. Cumulative distributions of ventilation rates for a year were calculated, using a multi-zone air flow model, for individual rooms. It is shown that the ventilation rate will vary very much, without any interaction from the occupants or an automatic control system. A modern system for passive stack ventilation must include a system for control of the air flows in order to avoid excessive use of energy and inadequate indoor air quality.

The problem of sensation of draught in ventilated spaces is connected to inappropriate velocities in the occupied zone. In Scandinavia, velocities higher than 0.15 m/s are said to be an indicator of that occupants are likely to feel discomfort. Therefore knowledge of the flow field (both mean velocities and fluctuations) is necessary. Both experimental and numerical analysis of the flow field in a full scale room ventilated by a slot inlet, with two inlet Reynolds numbers 2440 and 7110, have been carried out. Results from both approaches show that the location of the maximum velocity near the floor is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. For a two-dimensional room, the maximum velocity at the floor level occurred at about 2/3 room length from the supply. The distance from the floor level is dependent on the inlet Reynolds number. The velocity profiles far away from the wall opposite to the inlet device have the same character as a wall jet profile. However, close to the corners they are transformed. The relative turbulence intensities measured in the return flow region are questionable, because of a hot wire's inability to record large fluctuations at low mean velocities. These turbulence intensities close to floor level vary from 15 to 80% and as the authors have pointed out previously hot wires do not indicate the real value of the turbulence intensities beyond 20%. Difficulties appear in numerical predictions of return flow properties. Comparison between predicted values and experimentally obtained values show a reasonable agreement. This is promising for future CFD-predictions. However, there is a need for an appropriate measurement technique that can cope with reversing flow.

Full scale measurements of air flow velocities, temperature, intensity of turbulence and air exchange rate are carried out on two rooms with different types of ventilation located in the department of architecture at Chalmers University of Technology. The measurements have shown that mixed ventilation gives variable mean flow velocities with a high risk of draught as compared to the room provided with displacement ventilation. Air exchange rate for the room with displacement ventilation is obtained from tracer gas monitor by employing decay and constant emission methods. The measurements give similar results for both the methods.

The homogeneous emission passive tracer gas technique is described. This technique relies on an even distribution of constant tracer gas emission rate within the object to be measured, so that the emission rate per volume unit is constant. The local steady state concentration of the tracer gas is directly proportional to the mean age of air and the emission rate per volume unit. The technique was applied in 10 school buildings, of which 4 were newly constructed naturally ventilated buildings, 2 were old naturally ventilated buildings, 2 were old mechanically ventilated buildings and 2 were newly constructed supply and exhaust ventilated buildings. The result shows that the ventilation rates in naturally ventilated schools are relatively low compared to required standards. It demonstrates the importance of not only relying on the naturally induced ventilation rate, but also to use other means for improving the air quality during or between lessons, like window opening.

The use of local exhaust is considered to be the most effective way to control pollutant dispersion from intense sources, such as in kitchens, in toilets, as well as in copy machine rooms. The optimum air exhaust rate required to prevent pollutants from escaping into the major occupant areas very much depends on the natural air exchange rate (AER) between the hooded room and the major room space. This paper presents a mathematical model and a test procedure of using tracer gas technique to quantify the AER. In this study, the mathematical model analyzes the balance the balance of a tracer gas in two adjacent zones, and establishes two correlations between the dimensionless increase/decay rates of the gas concentrations and the AER. The mathematical model reveals two alternative ways to determine the AER: a). Tracer gas concentrations in both rooms involved be monitored; b). Tracer gas concentration in one of the two spaces be monitored. The latter method was validated in a test for AER quantification between ceiling void and room in a test chamber. Finally the proper use of the two methods is discussed, and it is suggested that the techniques developed in this study can be used for estimating minimum exhaust rate requirement for ventilation system renovation in existing buildings.
