JETSKI SURVIVORS CAN SEEK
STATE LAW DAMAGES,
HIGH COURT CONCLUDES

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 9 unanimously affirmed the
Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' November 1994 determination
that the damages recoverable by a jetski accident victim's
survivors are not limited to those available under the general
maritime cause of action for wrongful death.  Yamaha Motor Corp.
U.S.A. et al. v. Calhoun et al., No. 94-1387 (U.S.); see Consumer
Product Litigation Reporter, September 1995.

     In an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the
high court agreed that the cause of action established in Moragne
v. States Marine Lines (U.S. 1970) does not displace state
remedies in maritime wrongful death actions where no applicable
federal statute controls and the decedent was not a seaman or
otherwise engaged in the maritime trade.

     Twelve-year-old Natalie Calhoun was killed in a 1989
accident while piloting a "Wavejammer" jetski manufactured by the
petitioner Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A.  Natalie had rented the
product while vacationing in Puerto Rico, and died when the
vehicle struck a vessel anchored off her hotel's frontage.

     Her parents brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania the following year, basing their
claims in Pennsylvania's wrongful death and survival statutes and
demanding damages including lost future earnings, loss of
society, loss of support and services and punitive damages.
Yamaha sought partial summary judgment, arguing that Moragne
displaced state frameworks for awarding maritime wrongful death
damages.

     The trial court agreed, but held that the Calhouns could
still viably make demand for loss of society and loss of support
and services.  The parties cross-appealed; the Third Circuit
ruled on Nov. 2 that Moragne would not preempt state wrongful
death statutes on claims over non-seamen within territorial
waters.  The high court agreed to review the decision in
May 1995.

     In its affirmance, the Supreme Court stated that
"[t]raditionally, state remedies have been applied in accident
cases of this order " maritime wrongful death cases in which no
federal statute specifies the appropriate relief and the decedent
was not a seaman, longshore worker, or person otherwise engaged
in a maritime trade.  We hold, in accord with the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that state remedies
remain applicable in such cases and have not been displaced by
the federal maritime wrongful death action recognized in
Moragne."

     As a preliminary matter, the high court held that the
federal appellate courts have jurisdiction in an interlocutory
appeal "over any question that is included within the order that
contains the controlling question of law identified by the
district court."  Justice Ginsburg found the text of 28 U.S.C.
Section 1292(b) to indicate that "appellate jurisdiction applies
to the order certified to the court of appeals, and is not tied
to the particular question formulated by the district court."

     In turning to the substantive issue, the Supreme Court found
that "[t]he exercise of admiralty [jurisdiction] 'does not result
in automatic displacement of state law'....  Indeed, prior to
Moragne, federal admiralty courts routinely applied state
wrongful death and survival statutes in maritime accident cases."

     The court engaged in a review of wrongful death claims under
maritime law that reached back to its 1886 decision in The
Harrisburg.  The court had then concluded that general maritime
law did not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death;
subsequently, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "[f]ederal admiralty courts
tempered the harshness of The Harrisburg's rule by allowing
recovery under state wrongful death statutes."

     With the publication of Moragne in 1970, the high court
overruled The Harrisburg and concluded that an action "lie[s]
under general maritime law for death caused by violation of
maritime duties."

     Here, the high court found Yamaha's contention that Moragne
encompasses all deaths in state territorial waters to be "not
without force; in several contexts, we have recognized that
vindication of maritime policies demanded uniform adherence to a
federal rule of decision, with no leeway for variation or
supplementation by state law."

     Ultimately, the high court wrote, the concerns for
uniformity that prompted the scuttling of The Harrisburg "were of
a different order than those invoked by Yamaha.  Moragne did not
reexamine the soundness of The Harrisburg out of concern that
state damage awards in maritime wrongful death cases were
excessive, or that variations in the remedies afforded by the
States threatened to interfere with the harmonious operation of
maritime law."

               The inconsistencies in maritime law that prompted the
Moragne court, Justice Ginsburg concluded, "relate to ships and
the workers who serve them, and to a distinctly maritime
substantive concept " the unseaworthiness doctrine."  The court
concluded that Moragne "centered on the extension of relief, not
on the contraction of remedies.  The decision recalled that 'it
better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in
admiralty to give than to withhold the remedy, when not required
to withhold it by established and inflexible rules.'"

     The opinion lastly cited at length to the reasoning below of
the Third Circuit, which had noted that "Congress has not
prescribed remedies for the wrongful deaths of nonseafarers in
territorial waters."

IN SUPREME CT.: AIRBAG
NEGLIGENCE CLAIM NOT
PREEMPTED BY SAFETY ACT

     The Indiana Supreme Court on Dec. 28 overturned a lower
court's grant of summary judgment favoring General Motors and
determined that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act
does not preempt a common law negligence claim based on failure
to install airbags.  Wilson et al. v. Pleasant et al., No. 64S03-
9506-CV-693 (IN Sup. Ct.).

     The lawsuit was lodged by the estate of James Wilson, who
died in a 1988 head-on collision while driving a 1986 Chevrolet.
Wilson had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of the
accident.  The suit, which named the driver of the other vehicle
as well as GM, alleged that the manufacturer was negligent in
designing, manufacturing and selling a car that wasn't
crashworthy due to the lack of an airbag passive restraint
system.

     GM sought summary judgment from the Porter County Superior
Court, arguing that the estate's common law claims were federally
preempted by the Safety Act and certain safety regulations
promulgated thereunder.  The trial court granted the motion; the
Indiana Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed, declaring that
while the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the negligence
claim, implied preemption could be found.

               In its review, the state high court preliminarily noted the
language of the Safety Act's preemption clause (Section 1392[d])
and state common law savings clause (Section 1397[k]); the panel
also observed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, which
gave the manufacturer three options for providing passenger crash
protection.  The court acknowledged that the manual seat belt
system in Wilson's car fully complied with the third option.

     The court agreed with the Court of Appeals' assessment that
the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the estate's claim.
"The pre-emption clause found in the Safety Act explicitly
refers, with respect to 'any motor vehicle or item of motor
vehicle equipment,' only to state 'safety standard[s] applicable
to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of
equipment which is not identical to the federal standard,'" the
panel wrote.

     As to the finding of implied preemption, however, the court
observed that the "clear weight of authority prior to 1992
supported General Motors's view that the Safety Act impliedly
pre-empts state common law claims like the one asserted by
Wilson."  The panel then engaged in a review of the alterations
to the federal preemption analysis wrought by the U.S. Supreme
Court's rulings in Cipollone v. Liggett Group (1992) and
Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick (1995).

     "[W]e cannot help observing that Myrick did not overrule
Cipollone," the court concluded.  "Rather, the Supreme Court held
that interpretations of Cipollone to the effect that implied
pre-emption cannot exist when Congress has chosen to include an
express pre-emption clause were incorrect interpretations."

     The court read Cipollone/Myrick to establish the following
analysis in order to establish implied preemption:  "First, if
the federal statute at issue contains pre-emption language, we
determine whether that provision alone provides a reliable
indication of congressional intent with respect to its
pre-emptive effect," the panel wrote.  Such determination would
be made, the court stated, "by employing canons of statutory
construction and by examining the other provisions of the statute
" and the statute as a whole " to see if they offer any cause to
look beyond the express pre-emption language."

     If a reliable indication of congressional intent is found,
the panel wrote, there is no need to look beyond the preemption
language itself.  Otherwise, the court continued, "we must
determine whether the state law in question is in actual conflict
with federal law, [i.e.,] (1) whether it is impossible for a
private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,
or (2) whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives
of Congress."

     In turning to the facts at hand, the court found it
"immediately obvious that the Section 1392(d) pre-emption clause
in the Safety Act, taken alone, does not provide a reliable
indication of congressional intent with respect to its
pre-emptive effect."  The panel also found that the language of
the Section 1397(k) savings clause indicated that the Safety
Act's preemptive scope is not governed entirely by the Act's
preemption language.

     The court concluded, however, that the language of Section
1392(d) and Section 1397(k) read together foreclosed an
application of an implied preemption analysis.  "[W]e see only a
prohibition on state motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment
safety standards not identical to federal safety standards
applicable to the same aspect of performance of the motor vehicle
or item of motor vehicle equipment," the court wrote.

     Although the panel determined a full implied preemption
analysis to be unnecessary, it engaged in such a review and still
found no preemption of the claims.  "[W]e conclude that there is
no conflict between state common law in this case and the choices
presented by Rule 208," the panel wrote.  "Assuming, arguendo,
that Indiana common law requires airbags, there would be no
conflict with Rule 208 because Rule 208 does not prohibit airbags
" it only permits some other alternatives."

     The court also found that a finding of implied preemption
here "would be inconsistent with the purpose of and policies
underlying the Safety Act....  It would defeat the purpose of the
statute if manufacturers were not discouraged from utilizing a
safety system that would otherwise be considered negligent under
state common law tort theories."

     James W. Myers III, Valparaiso, IN, and David H. Knobel,
Merrillville, IN, represent the appellant.

     David M. Heilbron and Leslie G. Landau of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen, San Francisco, and Alex Dimitrief of Kirkland &
Ellis, Chicago, represent General Motors.

MICHIGAN JURY FINDS NO
DEFECT IN THREE-WHEEL ATV

     A Michigan federal court jury returned a unanimous verdict
for Honda Motor Co. defendants Dec. 7, finding that a 1985 Honda
ATC-125M three-wheel all-terrain vehicle was not defective.
Carwile v. Honda Research & Development Co., Ltd. et al. (ED MI).

     The jury also found that the Honda defendants were not
negligent with respect to the design and marketing of the ATV or
the warnings that accompanied the vehicle.

     The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail near
Jensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearing
a helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve and
suffered a severe closed head injury.

     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult to
turn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequately
warn about the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda countered
that Carwile's accident was caused by excessive speed,
inattention and inadequate vehicle maintenance.

     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer David
Renfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,
M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; Gary
Lustgarden, M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocational
rehabilitation expert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; and
economist Michael Thompson.

     Honda called Kevin Breen, an expert on vehicle design,
accident reconstruction and off-road vehicle riding; Harry H.
Hurt Jr., on the design and protection offered by motorcycle
helmets; and Dr. Philip Haber, on vocational rehabilitation.
Honda also called Masayuka Tanaka, an employee of Honda R&D Co.,
Ltd., to discuss ATV development and design, and Edward Glynn, an
employee of American Honda Motor Co., to discuss Honda's ATV
safety efforts and the Consumer Product Safety Commission
investigation of the vehicles.

     Honda was represented by Robert K. Miller, Larry C. Mann and
Timothy J. Mattson of Bowman and Brooke in Minneapolis and
Detroit.  Carwile was represented by Steven Leuchtman and Frank
Mafrice of Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz in Detroit.

ALABAMA JURY AWARDS
$120,000 ON DEFECTIVE
SUZUKI FOUR-WHEEL ATV

     An Alabama state court jury awarded $200,000 in damages to
plaintiff Bobby G. Norman, who claimed that a defective throttle
cable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-
of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.
Norman v. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56
(AL Cir. Ct., Lauderdale Cty.).

     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore Cycle
Center.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned the
handlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at which
point the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over an
embankment.

     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting a
tree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  He
sustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, and
tore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedic
surgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate his
condition.

     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles of
use.  Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX,
tested exemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda,
Kawasaki and Yamaha to determine how much force was needed to
cause a separation.  All of the other brands not only out-
performed the Suzuki cable, but were more substantial in
appearance, he opined.

     The defendants argued that the accident was caused by
operator error and Norman's failure to take the offered free
safety course.  Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI,
tested the exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involved
in the accident and found no possibility of malfunction as
claimed by the plaintiff.

     Norman was represented by Debra H. Coble and Frank B. Potts
of Potts & Young in Florence, AL.  Longshore Cycle Center was
represented by Danny D. Henderson of Huntsville, AL.  Suzuki was
represented by John Bergquist of Parsons, Lee & Juliano in
Birmingham, AL.

HIGH CT. REJECTS
CROSS-PETITIONS FOR REVIEW
OF RISK-UTILITY RULING

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 8 denied the separate bids of
Honda Motor Co. and a Mississippi plaintiff to overturn the Fifth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' May 1995 determinations in a
motorcycle product liability action.  Honda Motor Co. et al. v.
Satcher, No. 95-653 (U.S.); Satcher v. Honda Motor Co. et al.,
No. 95-674 (U.S.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter,
November 1995.

     The manufacturer had asserted that the appellate panel had
infringed its due process rights in refusing a new trial, and
James Satcher had averred that the Fifth Circuit had no basis on
which to vacate his $2 million award for punitive damages.

     Satcher, who had been driving the defendant's Nighthawk
motorcycle in the 1985 traffic accident that cost him his leg,
obtained $1 million in compensatory damages following a 1991 jury
trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi.  In its initial review of the case in 1993, the
Fifth Circuit reversed.  The panel concluded that as a matter of
state law, the product's claimed defect (lack of leg guards) was
open and obvious to the ordinary consumer.

     Following the Mississippi Supreme Court's issuance of
Sperry-New Holland v. Prestage (1993) shortly thereafter, the
Fifth Circuit vacated its prior ruling and ordered the district
court to reconsider in light of Prestage (which held that the
risk-utility analysis superseded the consumer expectations test
in product liability actions) and the state's recently enacted
product liability statute.  The trial court found for Satcher on
remand.

     In its affirmance of last May 30, the Fifth Circuit rejected
Honda's contentions that it was entitled to a new trial as
Prestage caused a substantive alteration to Mississippi law.  The
panel did strike Satcher's punitive award, concluding that the
defendant's conduct in not including leg guards in its product
design was not so extreme or outrageous as to support it.

     Both litigants filed petitions for writ of certiorari in the
high court late last October.  Honda contended that it was
entitled to new trial in order to defend on a risk-utility
theory, rather than under the consumer expectations test.
Satcher argued that under the Fifth Circuit's punitive damages
standard, such awards may be reversed on a showing of "mere
disagreement in the scientific community as to whether the
defendant's conduct was reasonable."

     Mack E. Barham and Robert E. Arcenaux of Barham & Arcenaux,
PLC, New Orleans; Peter K. Smith, Quitman, MS; Wilton L.
Strickland, Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Ray Ferrero Jr. of Ferrero &
Middlebrooks, P.A., Fort Lauderdale, represent James Satcher.

B.F. GOODRICH PETITIONS
CA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPER
SERVICE OF SUMMONS

     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the California
Supreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was not
properly served with a summons in an exploding-tire case, and
that the trial court disregarded long-standing case authority in
adopting the "substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.
B.F. Goodrich Co. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529
(CA Sup. Ct.).

     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded that
service was improper in that:

     " Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;

     " there was no notice pursuant to California Code of Civil
     Procedure Section 412.30;

     " if service was attempted, no designation was made;

               " the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the person
     who received the summons was served;

     " no date of delivery was noted; and

     " the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of
     the person who allegedly received service.

     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire exploded
while being inflated at a gas station.  He then served what
Goodrich calls an "admittedly defective summons" and complaint on
"The B.F. Goodrich Company," not the named defendant "B.F.
Goodrich."

     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quash
and the state appeals court denied review.  In its petition to
the California Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law is
clear that 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply where
the summons fails to identify the individual being served on
behalf of a corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded its
jurisdiction.  Therefore, based on the evidence before it, the
Superior Court abused its discretion in denying petitioner's
motion to quash."

     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"
rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the case
along" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "We
cannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble the
cause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast track
rules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.
This case presents clear issues of first impression concerning
adequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effect
of fast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving cases
to trial within the fast track limitation framework even against
entities that are not proper parties."

     Goodrich is represented by David B. Paynter, Paul Ellis
Baron and Valerie L. Leatherwood of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois &
Brisgard in San Francisco.

8TH CIR. FINDS LAWN MOWER
DESIGN DEFECT CLAIMS
NOT PREEMPTED BY CPSA

     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 27
partially reversed a Minnesota federal court's determinations and
found that a family's design defect claims against a lawnmower
manufacturer were not preempted by the Consumer Product Safety
Act (CPSA).  Moe et al. v. MTD Products Inc., No. 95-1938
(8th Cir.).

     The panel did affirm the defense judgment on the balance of
the plaintiffs' claims, holding the remaining theories of
recovery preempted by the CPSA.

     In July 1992, the fingers of 17-year-old Brian Moe were
amputated when he reached into the side grass chute of a self-
propelled walk-behind mower manufactured by MTD Products Inc.
The mower was equipped with a safety device called a blade
brake/clutch system (BBC), which allows the cutting blade to
rotate only when the control lever of the operator handle is
engaged.  Brian was an experienced operator of the mower, and had
removed grass from the side chute twice on the morning of his
accident without incident.

     It was subsequently discovered that the BBC's control cable
had been broken.  In their action against MTD, Brian's parents
asserted that the mower was defectively designed in that the
control cable was routed in such a manner that it rubbed against
the throttle control housing, causing it to fray and ultimately
break.  In its response, MTD pointed to the fact that in 1991,
the mower's handle had broken from the base, and Thomas Moe had
it reattached by a welder.  The repaired handle was 1-3/8 inches
longer than the original, and MTD claimed that the resultant
increase of stress on the BBC control cable caused its breakage.

     The Moes also alleged that an additional label warning that
the cable may fray should have been placed on the mower's handle.
While the owner's manual advised that the control cable should be
inspected, the plaintiffs asserted that this was insufficient
notice of the potential hazard.  The U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota determined that all of the Moes' claims
were preempted by the CPSA.

     On appeal, the Moes contended that their failure to warn and
design defect arguments were not federally preempted.  MTD
conceded that the design defect allegations were not preempted,
but argued that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate
because the product had been substantially altered.

     In its review, the Eighth Circuit noted that the Consumer
Product Safety Commission has promulgated a safety standard for
walk-behind power motors, which provides that a label warning
against blade contact injury must be placed on each mower's blade
housing.  In considering the Moes' contention that a warning that
the BBC cable may fray is required, the court stated that the
"risk of injury contemplated by such a warning is the same as
that addressed by the labelling requirements in the Mower
Standard " injury to the hands by the cutting blade."  The Moes'
claim, the panel wrote, "would create a state standard requiring
additional warnings on lawn mowers or in owners manuals related
to the same risk of injury addressed by the federal standard."

     The panel did find the plaintiffs' design defect claims to
be contemplated by the CPSA's savings clause.  "A successful tort
action based on the defective design of an installed BBC would
not create a different standard for mower safety or impose
different requirements on the manufacturer," the court wrote.

     As to MTD's substantial alteration argument, the court
stated that the "record here shows that issues of material fact
exist as to whether the BBC design caused Brian's injury....
Based on the evidence in the record, it would not be 'sheer
speculation' for a jury in this case to find that the design,
rather than the alteration, caused the fraying and the accident."

MO CT. APP.: CASUAL LENDER
OF NAIL GUN NOT STRICTLY
LIABLE OR NEGLIGENT

     The owner who loaned an allegedly defectively designed nail
gun to someone cannot be held liable on theories of strict
liability or negligence if the user injures somebody, the
Missouri Court of Appeals has ruled.  Bailey v. Innovative
Management & Investment Inc., No. WD 50922 (MO Ct. App.).

     In a unanimous Dec. 19 decision, the panel upheld summary
judgment against a man injured when a nail was accidentally
discharged into his head.

     Innovative Management & Investment loaned a nail gun and
other tools to an employee who was building his own home on his
own time.  Plaintiff Ron Bailey volunteered to help with the
project.  The employee's brother was using the nail gun when
Bailey inadvertently hit the bottom of the device, causing it to
discharge.

     A petition was filed in Boone County Circuit Court alleging
product defect and failure to warn strict liability counts, plus
a claim for negligently furnishing a dangerous instrumentality.
Judge Ellen S. Roper granted the defense motion for summary
judgment.

     The Court of Appeals, Western District, affirmed in an
opinion by Judge James M. Smart Jr.  The panel found no basis for
the strict liability causes of action because Innovative
Management did not inject the nail gun into the stream of
commerce and because the employee did not receive the nail gun
for the mutual benefit of the company and himself.  Innovative
Management supplied the nail gun as an isolated, non-commercial
transaction without financial or other compensation, it said, and
the company was not in the business of selling or furnishing
tools.

     As for the negligence count, the court said the company's
mere furnishing of the nail gun was insufficient to support the
claim because only a gratuitous bailment was involved.
Innovative Management owed Bailey no duty to protect him from
injury because the company received no benefit or advantage from
loaning the instrument to the employee, it said.  The court also
cited uncontradicted testimony that the company president was
unaware of any defect or dangerous condition when the employee
borrowed the nail gun.

     Debbie S. Champion of St. Louis represented Bailey.  Jeffrey
O. Parshall of Columbia represented Innovative Management.

MA CT. REFUSES ROWING MACHINE
SUPPLIER BID FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
ON MARKET SHARE ARGUMENT

     Justice Francis X. Spina of the Berkshire, MA, Superior
Court on Dec. 12 rejected the attempt of a rowing machine
supplier to obtain summary judgment on a seller's third-party
claim for market share liability.  Mahar v. Hanover House
Industries Inc. v. Etna Products et al., No. 88-0156
(MA Super. Ct., Berkshire).

     The judge found the present facts distinguishable from those
in a 1982 diethylstilbestrol (DES) case in which the state high
court declined to adopt the market share liability doctrine for
identifying a liable manufacturer defendant.

     The litigation was brought by David Mahar, who alleged that
he sustained injuries in 1987 while using a rowing exerciser
purchased through the mail from Hanover House Industries.
Hanover brought a third-party complaint against three of its
suppliers; one supplier was later voluntarily dismissed.

     In the two-week period before the product was shipped to
Mahar, Hanover received some 58,199 rowing machines from supplier
E. Mishan & Sons and another 35,686 from Etna Products.  The
machines were indistinguishable as to their supplier, and Hanover
had no inventory control in place that could identify the
supplier of the product Mahar purchased.  Etna sought summary
judgment for failure to identify the actual supplier.

     Justice Spina wrote that "[n]o Massachusetts appellate case
has ever held that a 'market-share' approach may be used to
establish the requisite element of the 'identity' of the
manufacturer or supplier in a product liability case," and noted
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's refusal to do so in
the DES case Payton v. Abbott Labs (1982).

     "Several factors are present in this case which were not
present in Payton," the judge continued, "and factors which
caused the Payton Court concern are not present here."  He noted
that all probable suppliers of the product had been named to the
case; he found that the suppliers "were equally as able as the
defendant to identify the unit shipped, and may still inspect the
unit to try and determine the route of its delivery to the
plaintiff."

               The judge further observed that Etna may still offer proof
that it did not supply the unit in issue, and that both suppliers
may implead the product's manufacturer.  He lastly noted that
"there is no public policy supportive of research and development
of new drugs/medicine impacted here."

     Justice Spina concluded that the dispute was "an appropriate
case to allow a plaintiff to proceed with and develop a theory of
liability which is in the formative stages in this Commonwealth
and which has a reasonably good chance for recognition by the
appellate courts."

EVIDENCE OF SUBSEQUENT
REMEDIAL MEASURES CAN BE
EXCLUDED, 11TH CIR. HOLDS

     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 18 ruled upon
a matter of first impression and held that evidence of subsequent
remedial measures in strict product liability cases may be
properly excluded under Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence.  Wood v. Morbark Industries Inc. et al., No. 93-3472
(11th Cir.).

     The panel did reverse a Florida district judge's denial of
new trial to the plaintiff/appellant, however, determining that
the evidence in issue below had been properly admitted for
impeachment purposes.

     Morbark Industries Inc. had been sued by Ruby Wood, whose
husband, Ginger, died in a 1989 accident involving an "Eeger
Beever" wood chipper of the defendant's manufacture.  Ginger
Wood, a municipal employee, was pulled into the device up to his
upper torso.  In arguing that the product was defective and
unreasonably dangerous, she asserted that the chipper's 17-inch
infeed chute was too short to adequately protect the machine's
operator.

     Morbark was granted a motion in limine to exclude evidence
of post-accident design changes to the chipper that lengthened
the infeed chute.  In its review, the 11th Circuit noted that
defense counsel still "sought to imply to the jury that the
seventeen-inch chute was the safest length chute available and
was still in use by [Ginger's employer] as well as other
government agencies."

     In the course of a 1993 trial in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Florida, plaintiffs' counsel cross-
examined Norvel Morey, Morbark's president and designer of the
Eeger Beever, on the issue of subsequent design changes.  The
trial judge admonished the attorney before the jury, and directed
the jury to disregard any comment concerning the sale of longer
chutes.

               The panel ultimately found for Morbark, determining the
Eeger Beever not to be unreasonably dangerous as designed and
marketed.  Ruby Wood sought new trial, claiming that the trial
judge had committed reversible error by admonishing plaintiff's
counsel before the jury.  In rejecting the motion, the trial
judge found that the admonition had not been unduly prejudicial
to the plaintiff's case.

     In its analysis, the 11th Circuit first rejected Wood's
contention that Rule 407 should not be applied in strict product
liability cases.  "We are persuaded that Rule 407 is necessary in
such cases to focus the jury's attention on the product's
condition or design at the time of the accident," the panel
wrote.  The panel rejected Wood's entreaty to follow the 10th
Circuit's reasoning in Moe v. Avions Marcel (1984), which stated
that federal courts must apply state evidentiary principles if
they conflict with FRE 407.

     Wood next argued that if FRE 407 was deemed controlling,
then the trial court should have applied one of the exceptions to
the rule and held the evidence admissible either to show the
feasibility of precautionary measures, or for impeachment.  Wood
had specifically pointed to Morey's testimony that the 17-inch
chute was the "safest length chute you could possibly put on the
machine."

     The court stated that "[w]hile we do not find that this
testimony put feasibility at issue, we do find that it opened the
door to impeachment....  Wood's counsel should have been allowed
to ask why the supposedly safest design possible was modified
after the accident involving Ginger Wood."

     The panel found that the refusal to allow impeachment of the
witness did not in and of itself substantially affect Wood's
rights, but did have such an impact when considered in
conjunction with the court's direction to the jury.

CA JUDGE DENIES
POST-TRIAL MOTIONS
OF LORILLARD, H&V

     California Superior Court Judge Winton McKibben, without
elaboration, on Nov. 6 denied the motions of Lorillard, Inc. and
Hollingsworth & Vose Co. for a new trial of Milton Horowitz's
suit alleging mesothelioma from asbestos contained in Kent brand
cigarettes.  Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al., No. 965-245
(CA Super. Ct., San Francisco); see Consumer Product Litigation
Reporter, September 1995.

     Horowitz and his wife, Shirley Horowitz, won jury verdicts
for $2 million against the companies on Aug. 31 after a trial
before Judge McKibben.  The award includes $700,000 in punitive
damages.
               Milton Horowitz, 72, is a retired university professor from
Beverly Hills, CA.  He was still active as a clinical
psychologist when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June
1994.  His suit alleges that his cancer was caused by the
asbestos-containing Micronite filters used on Kent cigarettes
between 1952 and 1956.  The suit named Lorillard, Inc. as the
manufacturer of the Kent cigarettes and Hollingsworth & Vose Co.
as the manufacturer of the Micronite filters.

     During the trial, Horowitz claimed that the Kent Micronite
filter was defective and that it rendered the Kent cigarettes
defective by releasing asbestos fibers which he inhaled.  He also
contended that the defendant companies were negligent and failed
to warn about the asbestos health hazard associated with Kent
cigarettes.  He further asserted that the companies
misrepresented the cigarette and filter by claiming that the
filter was "totally harmless" and that the Kent cigarette
"offered the greatest health protection of any cigarette."

     Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose defended by arguing that
the filter did not release asbestos fibers.  They also asserted
that Horowitz did not smoke Kent cigarettes in the time period
between 1952 and 1956, when the filter contained asbestos, and
they suggested that he was either mistaken or lying when he said
that he did.

     The jury found for the plaintiffs on all theories of
liability except for the intentional fraud claim " it found that
the defendants made their health representation without knowing
one way or the other whether the filter was "totally harmless."
It awarded $350,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in non-
economic damages to Milton Horowitz, and it awarded $250,000 on a
loss of consortium claim by Shirley Horowitz.  It also found that
Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose were each 50% responsible for
the plaintiffs' injuries and damages.

     The jury further determined that Milton Horowitz had
suffered appreciable harm before June 4, 1986, a finding required
by California's Proposition 51, the statute requiring
apportionment of non-economic damages for actions accruing after
June 4, 1986.

     Lastly, the jury found that the plaintiffs had shown by
clear and convincing evidence that each defendant acted with
malice, oppression or fraud, thus entitling the plaintiffs to
punitive damages.

     After a brief supplemental argument, the jury retired on
Aug. 31 to further deliberate the amount, if any, of punitive
damages to award.  It returned with a verdict on Sept. 1,
awarding punitive damages of $560,000 against Lorillard and
$140,000 against Hollingsworth & Vose.

     In its post-trial motion, Hollingsworth & Vose argued that
the court had erred by admitting the deposition testimony of
Elise Comproni, an inspector with the Massachusetts Department of
Labor and Industries, Division of Occupational Hygiene.  Comproni
testified that in 1953 he was "appalled" when he learned that
asbestos was being used in the Kent cigarette filters.
Hollingsworth & Vose argued that he was not qualified to give an
opinion concerning the potential hazards of an asbestos-
containing filter in the early 1950s and that it was prejudiced
by repeated references to the testimony by counsel for the
Horowitzes.

     The filter maker also argued that the weight of the evidence
presented at trial was insufficient to justify the jury's finding
that it had been negligent.  "[P]laintiffs were required to
demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that defendants knew
or should have known of the harmful health effects associated
with an asbestos-containing filter between 1952 and 1956.
Plaintiffs offered no testimony or studies which suggested that
medical science believed such a danger existed during this
period," it asserted.

     Hollingsworth & Vose also contended that it had been
prejudiced by the court decision to allow the jury to consider
fraud claims against it.  The Horowitz complaint, it noted, only
asserted fraud claims against Lorillard, and the plaintiffs
failed to present any evidence of fraud against it.

     Lorillard has prevailed in four previous lawsuits alleging
injury from the filters, largely by raising doubts about whether
the plaintiffs' illness was caused by Kent cigarettes or other
possible exposures to asbestos.  The company is currently
involved in 10 other lawsuits involving the Micronite filters.

     The plaintiffs were represented at trial by Madelyn J.
Chaber with Wartnick, Chaber, Harowitz, Smith & Tigerman in San
Francisco.

     Hollingsworth & Vose is represented by Andrew J.
McElaney Jr., Stephen J. Brake and Daniel R. Harris with Nutter,
McLellan & Fish in Boston and by Donald F. Zimmer Jr. and Cynthia
C. Roenisch with Preuss Walker & Shanagher in San Francisco.
Lorillard is represented by Lewis L. Fenton, Larry E. Hayes and
Ronald F. Scholl with Fenton & Keller of Monterey, CA, and by
David K. Hardy, William S. Ohlemeyer and Mark J. Evans with
Shook, Hardy & Bacon of Kansas City, MO.

LORILLARD, FILTER MAKER
ADDED TO ASBESTOS CASE
IN MICHIGAN

     The plaintiffs in an occupational exposure asbestos case
filed an amended complaint in Michigan state court Dec. 4 to add
Lorillard Inc., Hollingsworth & Vose Co. and Macco Chemical Co.
as defendants in their personal injury product liability suit.
Sorise et al. v. 20th Century Glove Corp. of Texas et al.,
No. 95-521238 NP (MI Cir. Ct., Wayne Cty.).

     The amended complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Court
named the additional defendants because the lead plaintiff smoked
Kent cigarettes with "Micronite" filters in the 1950s.  In the
original July 25, 1995 complaint, retired tile setter Nelson
Sorise alleged his mesothelioma resulted from on-the-job exposure
to a variety of asbestos products.  Nearly 60 defendants were
named.

     The amendment added the three Kent defendants, alleging that
asbestos fibers in Micronite filters were also a proximate cause
of Sorise's mesothelioma.  According to the complaint, which
alleged failure to warn, Sorise smoked Kents between 1952 and
1956, the time when Micronite filters were used.

     According to Sorise's attorney, Michael B. Serling of
Birmingham, MI, Kents were marketed heavily as being safer than
their competitors on the basis that the Micronite filters removed
tar and nicotine.

     Kent's Micronite filters have been the focus of two recent
actions, one of which ended in a $2 million award in favor of a
California professor who alleged mesothelioma from the asbestos
in the Micronite filters (Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al.,
No. 964-245 [CA Super. Ct.]; see story this issue).  In the
other, a federal court jury in Chicago returned a defense verdict
in a suit brought by the family of an Encyclopedia Britannica
executive who died from cancer allegedly caused by the asbestos
in the filters (Braun v. Lorillard Inc. et al., No. 94-C-976
[ND IL]; see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December 1995,
P. 5,285).

     The Sorise case has been assigned to Judge Robert J.
Colombo Jr.

FORMER CIGARETTE MODEL,
10 OTHERS SUE CIGARETTE
MAKERS, SELLERS IN FL

     A former Winston cigarette model and 10 other people filed a
products liability suit against tobacco companies and cigarette
sellers Dec. 11 in Florida state court, alleging injury from
cigarette smoking.  Levine et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. et
al., No. CL 95-9806-AH, (FL Cir. Ct., 15th Jud. Cir., Palm Beach
Cty.).

     Lead plaintiff Alan Landers, also known as Allan Levine,
worked as a model in Winston print advertisements in the 1960s.
He has undergone two surgeries for lung cancer that he attributes
to smoking cigarettes.
               The complaint stated that the defendants' tobacco products,
when used as intended, were highly likely to cause, or contribute
in substantial fashion, to illness and injuries, including
bronchogenic carcinoma, chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular
disease and other conditions.

     "So likely were the serious health consequences of
defendants' tobacco products that over one in three foreseeable
users would be expected to suffer premature death or serious
impairment," the complaint said.  Further, the plaintiffs
maintained, tobacco products, when used as intended, "were highly
likely to induce in foreseeable users a state of addiction."

     The complaint contains counts of negligence, strict
liability and civil conspiracy.

     The plaintiffs claim that the tobacco firms had a duty to
design a safe product, but sold the cigarettes in their current
form knowing that they would probably cause disease and
addiction.

     Named defendants are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., American Tobacco Co., Philip Morris
Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., United States
Tobacco Sales & Marketing Co. Inc., Culbro Corp. (formerly known
as General Cigar Co. Inc.), and retailers ABC Liquors Inc.,
Publix Supermarkets Inc. and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Tracy E. Tomlin and
Michael T. Tomlin of Otero, Mullin & Tomlin of Coral Gables, FL,
and by Norwood S. Wilner of Spohrer, Wilner & Maxwell of
Jacksonville, FL.

KS SMOKELESS TOBACCO
CASE WITHDRAWN; NATIONAL
CLASS SUIT TO FOLLOW

     A lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents against the
makers of smokeless tobacco products was withdrawn Dec. 18 by
attorneys who filed the suit because they plan to refile on
behalf of a nationwide class of smokeless tobacco users.  Hammers
v. United States Tobacco Co., No. 95-1335-MLB (D KS); see
Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, August 1995.

     The lawsuit was filed July 24 in U.S. District Court for the
District of Kansas, in Wichita, alleging that the manufacturers
of smokeless tobacco products have designed sales campaigns that
specifically set out to lure users of their products to
"graduate" to products containing higher concentrations of
nicotine.

     The complaint was filed on behalf of all users of smokeless
tobacco products in Kansas.  The plaintiffs were seeking class
action status and had the potential of involving approximately
30,000 Kansas residents.

     Plaintiff attorney Derek Casey of Hutton & Hutton in Wichita
said he expected to file a new lawsuit on behalf of a nationwide
class by mid-February.

     The suit named as defendants United States Tobacco Co.,
Pinkerton Tobacco Co., Conwood Co., L.P., Helme Tobacco Co.,
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., The Smokeless Tobacco Council,
Inc., The Smokeless Tobacco Research Council, Inc., The Tobacco
Institute Inc. and The Council for Tobacco Research, Inc.

     The smokeless tobacco industry has been free from litigation
during a time when lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers have
been filed across the country.  In 1989, the 10th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals upheld a 1986 jury verdict that the evidence in
a case brought by the family of an Oklahoma teenager had failed
to show conclusively that the manufacturer's smokeless tobacco
was the cause of the teenager's death (Marsee v. United States
Tobacco Co., No. 86-2094 [10th Cir.]).

     The Marsee case turned on causation rather than addiction,
which was the basis for the Kansas lawsuit.

D MA DISMISSES MERCURY
POISONING SUIT AGAINST
TUNA CANNER ON CAUSATION

     A U.S. District Court judge sitting in Boston granted
summary judgment dismissing a personal injury complaint against a
tuna fish canning company on Nov. 30, because he concluded that
no genuine issue of any material fact would permit a jury to find
either that the plaintiff suffers from mercury poisoning or that
the cannery's product was the cause of any such poisoning.  Kern
v. Nozaki America Inc., No. 94-12272-RGS (D MA).

     Alice Kern filed a personal injury suit in 1994 alleging
negligence and breach of warranty.  She claimed that she
contracted mercury poisoning from eating five to seven cans of
Geisha brand canned tuna per week for 24 years.  Geisha brand is
sold by defendant Nozaki America Inc., which moved for summary
judgment.

     U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns found that while
there is no question that Kern is ill, the only disease that she
has been diagnosed as having is rheumatoid arthritis.  Her doctor
tested her blood for mercury in 1991 and found her mercury blood
level to be slightly above normal.  It returned to the mid-range
of normal after Kern stopped eating Geisha tuna and underwent
chelation therapy, Judge Stearns said.

     To prevail in her suit, Kern would have had to establish
that eating the amounts of tuna she claims to have ingested can
cause mercury poisoning and that Geisha brand tuna contains
mercury at levels sufficient to have caused the poisoning.  Judge
Stearns found that she could establish neither.

     "Viewing all inferences in the light most favorable to Kern,
there are no disputed facts in the record that would permit a
jury to find that Kern suffers from mercury poisoning, much less
that any such poisoning resulted from her consumption of Geisha
brand tuna," he said.

CIBA ARGUES CONTACT SOLUTION
NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS ARE
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW

     Approved labels and warnings on medical devices are
"specific requirements" of federal law that preempt causes of
action brought under state law, respondent Ciba Vision Corp.
argued in its answer to a petition filed by a California woman
asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling
that all of her claims against Ciba are preempted by the Medical
Devices Amendments.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608
(CA Sup. Ct.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December
1995.

     In its Nov. 15 answer, Ciba contended that the California
Court of Appeal, Sixth District, was aligned with a majority of
jurisdictions that have held that federal law preempts causes of
action brought under state law.

     Appellant Leslie Scott brought suit in California state
court against Ciba, alleging claims of strict liability,
negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and breach of
implied warranty.  Scott claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, from its saline solution.  She claimed that as a result
of her failure to distinguish between the bottles, she suffered
chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts in the
AOSEPT solution instead of the saline solution.

     Scott argued that, around the time of her injury, Ciba had
begun to market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also
continued to market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons
not wearing their contacts would have difficulty in
distinguishing the two.

     The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding Scott's claims preempted by the
MDA.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District,
affirmed the trial court.

     The Court of Appeal cited to Evraets v. Intermedics
Intraocular, Inc., 29 Cal.App.4th 786, and 21 C.F.R. Section
808.1(b), in holding that the "requirement" the Food and Drug
Administration refers to in Section 360k includes "any
requirement having the force and effect of law 'whether
established by statute, ordinance, regulation, or court
decision.'"

     Examining Scott's argument that the MDA contains no specific
counterpart regulations regarding AOSEPT, the Court of Appeal
held that all Class III medical devices are subject to the
requirements of the MDA, which include the FDA's stringent
premarket approval process.

     In her petition to the California Supreme Court, Scott
argued that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed
the issue of federal preemption concerning Class III devices
found that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v.
Pacesetter Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

     Some of the leading cases that have expounded on the issue
of preemption have recently been criticized, Scott said.  For
example, the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' 1984 ruling in
Martello v. Ciba Vision Corp. gave Section 360k(a), the MDA's
preemption provision, an expansive reading, but was criticized in
the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kennedy, Scott said.  "The...Ninth
Circuit in Kennedy...stated that the language of Section 360k(a)
does not create the broad, sweeping preemption found by the
'strained reading of the statute' by the court in Martello,"
Scott argued.

     And, Scott said, state actions that attempt to enforce
federal standards are not preempted.  Citing to Evraets, the
appellant said, regarding a claim of negligence per se, since the
state requirements are equal to the federal requirements because
they adopt the federal standards, they are not preempted.

     On the other hand, Ciba argued in its answer that a
consistent line of cases holds that state law tort and warranty
causes of action are preempted because the pre-market approval
process envelops the approved product in specific requirements of
federal law.

     "Scott makes no claim of any defect in the design or
manufacture of AOSEPT," Ciba said.  "Rather, she contends that
California tort and warranty law required that Ciba Vision
package and label AOSEPT differently in order to warn users
against accidental placement of deneutralized solution in the
eye."

     Ciba argued that this is a "strong case for MDA preemption"
because of AOSEPT's premarket approval and Scott's singular focus
on warning deficiencies in the product.

     The respondent said that the court's decision in Evraets,
which Scott cited in her petition, does not warrant review by the
state Supreme Court.  Ciba said Evraets does not deal with a
device that received FDA premarket approval.

     "Evraets contains a discussion of the preemption of state
law claims for breach of warranty that is consistent with the
decision in Scott," Ciba said.  "Evraets only reaches the issue
of preemption in relation to a claim of breach of an express
warranty."

     Ciba concluded that by enacting the MDA, Congress interposed
the FDA as an expert watchdog and preempted certain state law
causes of action.  A jury should not be allowed to rethink the
sufficiency of labels and packaging that the FDA endorsed, said
Ciba.

     In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeal cited
two cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  In
Evraets and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1444, the cases involved experimental products for
which adequate warnings were not yet known, Scott said.

     Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label and
warning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect in
the design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scott
argued.

     "Respondent is well aware that Leslie Scott claims that the
design of the two virtually indistinguishable white product
containers containing harmful and harmless ingredients
respectively are defective under both negligence and strict
liability theories," she stated.

     Scott is represented by Jonathan D. Gordon of the Law
Offices of Jonathan D. Gordon in Denver.  Ciba is represented by
Thomas M. Peterson and Diane S. Rice of Brobeck, Phleger &
Harrison in San Francisco.

PA SUP. CT.: LANDLORDS
HAVE NO DUTY TO INSPECT
FOR LEAD PAINT HAZARDS

     The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Nov. 22 reaffirmed a 27-
year-old ruling that landlords cannot be held to have
constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint to young
children occupying their premises and, therefore, that they have
no duty to test for and remove lead paint from their properties.
Felton v. Spratley et al., No. 7 East. Dist. App. Dkt. (PA
Sup. Ct.).

     The one-page per curiam decision stated that the appeal is
dismissed "as having been improvidently granted," with Justice
John P. Flaherty dissenting.  It offers no further commentary nor
is Justice Flaherty's dissent explained.
               Lucretia Felton and her daughter, Shakeema, petitioned for
rehearing on Dec. 6, and a ruling on that request is still
pending.  Their attorney, Edwin L. London of Matkoff & Shengold,
said he was "terribly disappointed" by the dismissal, especially
since the lower court ruling was a 2-1 split decision, and since
the Supreme Court had been briefed and had heard oral arguments
in October.

     The Supreme Court's dismissal lets stand a ruling affirming
the dismissal of this suit by the trial court on the grounds that
the landlord had no actual notice of the lead paint hazards in
the apartment she rented to the Feltons.

     The Feltons resided in an apartment leased from Marie
Spratley in 1988; Shakeema was diagnosed with lead poisoning the
following year.  When Spratley was notified of the chipping and
peeling lead paint by the Philadelphia Health Department, she had
the paint removed and the apartment repainted within a month.

     The Feltons then filed suit in the Philadelphia County Court
of Common Pleas, alleging negligence and carelessness in failing
to test for and remove the paint prior to Shakeema's poisoning
around May 1989.

     The trial court granted summary judgment to Jessie and
Mollucye Spratley Pearson, the executors of Marie Spratley's
estate, based on the grounds that Spratley was unaware of the
hazardous condition and, therefore, had no obligation to correct
it.  The defendants had argued that Lucretia Felton was aware of
the peeling paint for several months before Shakeema was
diagnosed, but never reported it to them.

     On appeal to state Superior Court, the Feltons conceded that
the defendants lacked actual knowledge of the presence of lead
paint in the apartment, but, they contended, knowledge about lead
paint poisoning had become widespread among the public by the
late 1980s and, therefore, Spratley should have had constructive
knowledge of the hazard and should have eliminated it.

     The Superior Court panel ruled 2-1 that it remained bound by
the state Supreme Court's holding in Kolojeski v. Deisher Inc.,
429, Pa. 191, 239 A.2d 329 (1968), which stated that where the
landlord had no notice that the walls were painted with lead
paint until after the plaintiffs had been treated for lead
poisoning, he had no affirmative duty to inspect the premises for
lead paint and he could not be held liable for the injuries.

     The Feltons argued that public knowledge of lead paint
hazards had increased substantially since 1968 when Kolojeski was
decided and, therefore, that the defendants should be held to
have had constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint.  The
Superior Court majority ruled that the Feltons failed to cite any
state law case or to otherwise persuade it to expand the law of
negligence between landlord and tenant.
               In a New York case in May, a five-judge appellate court
panel ruled that New York City's landlords do have an affirmative
duty to search out and remove lead paint in apartments occupied
by children, but that ruling was based on a city ordinance that
explicitly spells out that duty.  In October, the Residential
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X) went into
effect.  That federal law requires landlords throughout the
country to inform potential tenants of the presence of lead paint
in rental properties or to abate the hazard if the tenants
include young children.

     In addition to London, the Feltons are represented by Meryl
Cohen of Matkoff & Shengold in Philadelphia.  Spratley is
represented by Josh M. Greenbaum of Cozen & O'Connor, also in
Philadelphia.

1ST CIR: INSURANCE CO.
FAILS TO PROVE LANDLORD
INSURED FOR KNOWN RISK

     A landlord who knew his apartments were contaminated with
lead paint is still entitled to indemnification from his insurer
because the insurance company failed to show that when the
landlord took out the policy, he either knew the lead paint in
his building was the source of a tenant's lead poisoning or knew
that she would suffer further injury after the effective date of
the policy, according to a Nov. 28 ruling by the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals.  United States Liability Insurance Co. v.
Selman et al., No. 95-1435 (1st Cir.).

     Livingstone Selman owns an apartment house in Roxbury, MA,
where Robin Razza and her infant daughter, Carol Ann, resided.
Carol Ann was diagnosed with lead poisoning late in 1984.  Selman
began removing the lead paint on March 7, 1985, and by March 29,
an inspection of the Razzas' apartment showed it to be 95% lead-
free.

     In May 1985, Selman changed insurance carriers and insured
the apartment house with United States Liability Insurance Co.
(USLIC).  The insurance company renewed the policy in May 1986.
The Razzas moved from Selman's apartment building in September
1986 and subsequently brought a state law personal injury suit
against Selman that is still pending.

     USLIC, attempting to escape liability, brought a diversity
action seeking a declaratory judgment in U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts.  After a bench trial, the district
court ruled that USLIC had no duty to indemnify Selman for claims
for injuries resulting from Carol Ann's ingestion of lead paint
prior to May 4, 1985 (the inception date of the first policy).
However, the court ruled, USLIC does have a duty to indemnify
Selman with respect to claims arising while the policies were in
effect " from May 4, 1985, to May 3, 1987.
               On appeal, USLIC advanced three alternative grounds for
reversing the district court judgment:  (1) coverage was never
triggered because Carol Ann sustained no discernible injuries
while the insurance policies were in effect; (2) Carol Ann's
injuries were the result of her initial ingestion of lead paint
before the policies went into effect; and (3) Selman knew about
the liability before the policies went into effect and,
therefore, is precluded from coverage under the "known risk"
doctrine.

     Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya, writing for a unanimous
appellate panel, ruled first that the appeal had to be decided on
the "clear error" standard because the issues revolved around the
interpretation of substantial extrinsic evidence and not solely
on questions about the clear meaning of contract provisions.

     The district court was correct in determining that coverage
had been triggered because Razza's expert witness, Dr. John
Graef, testified that "at least a portion" of Carol Ann's claimed
injuries occurred during the policy periods, the appellate court
found.  Graef's testimony was supported by data showing sharp
increases, or "spikes," in Carol Ann's blood toxicity levels
corresponding to incidents of lead paint ingestion during the
policy period.

     Further, Graef testified that the new incidents of lead
paint ingestion resulted in further injuries that occurred during
the period covered by the policies because, unlike many other
diseases such as measles or chicken pox, lead poisoning injuries
are cumulative, the circuit court ruled.

     "[T]he district court had before it compelling evidence that
Carol Ann Razza ingested several 'big meals' of lead paint chips
while the appellant's policies were in force, and Dr. Graef
testified that each such ingestion caused (or potentially could
cause) discrete injury.  On this basis, the district court
warrantably found a clear nexus between Carol Ann's 'big meals'
and the spikes in her toxicity levels," Judge Selya wrote.

     On the issue of known risk, Judge Selya said, the central
question on appeal is:  "What did Selman know and when did he
know it?"  The known risk doctrine precludes coverage when the
insured knows in advance of the policy's effective date that a
specific loss has already happened or is substantially certain to
happen.

     "[T]he presence of risk runs to the very essence of an
insurance contract.  Where there is no risk of loss " as where a
loss has already occurred before a policy takes effect "
insurance ceases to serve its socially utile purpose of risk-
spreading," he said.

     Finding that the test for asserting the known risk doctrine
is subjective and that the insurer has the burden of proof, the
First Circuit ruled that nothing in the court record showed that
the lead paint in Selman's building was the source of Carol Ann's
illness (or that he knew of the connection), nor that Selman knew
that Carol Ann would suffer further injury from continued
exposure to lead paint.  Further, the panel said, given the
inspection report that the Razza apartment was 95% free of lead
six weeks before the first policy became effective, Selman could
easily have assumed that Carol Ann was no longer exposed to any
significant amount of lead paint and therefore would suffer no
further injury.

     "The district court's finding is strengthened by the utter
lack of any evidence that Selman attempted to conceal or
misrepresent the presence of lead paint in his apartment house
when he applied for insurance.  To the extent that the
appellant's application form did not request such information,
the appellant was the author of its own misfortune," Judge Selya
wrote.

     Finally, the panel ruled, the district court did not commit
reversible error in declining to interpret a clause in the policy
limiting the company's liability to $300,000 per occurrence as
meaning that USLIC's total potential liability is capped at
$300,000.  While the district court did not spell out its
reasoning, it seems self-evident that the basis for the ruling
was that the policy does not define the operative terms of that
clause, Judge Selya concluded.

     USLIC was represented by Alice Olsen Mann and Mark P. Bailey
of Morrison, Mahoney & Miller.  Selman was represented by Kenneth
H. Soble of Soble, Van Dam, Pearlman & Gittelsohn.  Clyde D.
Bergstresser and Angela M. Vieira of Bergstresser & Associates
represented Razza.  All are Boston firms.
