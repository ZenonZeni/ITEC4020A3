The next stage is for the uranium concentrates to be refined and, where necessary converted into another oxide form, pure metal or uranium hexafluoride gas.  Natural uranium, which is largely made up of non-fissile uranium-238 and contains only 0.7% of fissile uranium-235, can be used as fuel in reactors where the moderator is heavy water or graphite.  The uranium used in light water reactors normally has its content of the fissile uranium-235 enriched to a few per cent of the total after conversion to uranium hexafluoride gas.  For enrichment, gas diffusion or ultra centrifuging may be used;  laser enrichment is being developed.  The enriched uranium hexafluoride is then converted to uranium dioxide powder. 
<P>
In fuel fabrication, the fuel is pressed into small cylinders which are enclosed in zirconium alloy, magnox or stainless steel tubes. These tubes are then assembled to form a fuel element.  If used fuel is reprocessed, plutonium and uranium can be recycled and fuel elements with a mixture of dioxides of uranium and plutonium can be produced. 
The most important material left after the enrichment process is fairly large amount of depleted uranium, normally about 80 to 85 per cent by weight of the natural uranium from which it arose.  The depleted uranium typically contains from 0.25 to 0.30 per cent of fissile uranium-235:  this content is determined solely by the economic balance between the costs of uranium and separative work.  All commercial enrichers keep it in temporary storage, normally at the enrichment plants, for possible re-work using more advanced enrichment technology.  In the longer term, it could be used for breeder reactors. 
<P>
Depleted uranium is a relatively harmless substance and the dangers there are from it are more from its chemical effects than from its radiation effects.  However, with time, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, decays and develops active daughter products which are more dangerous, radium-226 and radon-222.  It therefore requires long term management, and is stored completely confined in purpose designed steel containers. There have been 40 years experience of its safe storage.
