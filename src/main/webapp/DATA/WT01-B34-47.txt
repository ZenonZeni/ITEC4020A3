<p>REFERENCES </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Millions of Americans suffer from pain. Among the most tragic
victims are those whose lives are consumed by chronic,
intractable pain. </p>

<p>Although narcotics can frequently help, they are typically
avoided or given at inadequate levels. A number of factors are
involved, including the fear of patient addiction and the threat
of disciplinary action f or overprescribing. In addition, pain is
difficult for the patient to describe and the physician to
evaluate. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, the result is often unnecessary
suffering. Evidence is steadily accumulating that persons with
intractable pain do not respond to narcotics in the same way as
do street addicts. Their motivations are different, and so are
their psychological reactions and tolerances to the drugs. The
pain patient can be treated with narcotics with little risk of
developing the self-destructive behavior characteristic of
addiction--even though dosages may sometimes far exceed the
&quot;normal.&quot; </p>

<p>The public needs to know that more can and should be done for
those people with chronic pain. </p>

<p>THE PAINFUL DILEMMA </p>

<p>Albert Schweitzer once said: </p>

<p>&quot;We must all die. But if I can save him from days of
torture, that is what I feel is my great and ever new privilege.
Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death
itself.&quot; </p>

<p>Everybody has suffered from pain--especially the intense acute
Pain that flares up when a toe is stubbed or a finger burned.
That pain soon goes away. But at least 20 million Americans
suffer from chronic pain that lasts for weeks or months--or may
never go away. Most of its victims are the middle-aged and the
elderly. </p>

<p>The most common form is low back pain, which arises from
osteoartharitis or other causes, and is estimated to afflict 15
percent of the population. Cancer patients often suffer severe
pain as their condition worsens. Burn victims may have
excruciating pain during recovery. Chronic pain includes tension
and migraine headaches. Individuals with arthritis often suffer
from chronic pain. </p>

<p>In fact, chronic pain is one of the nation's most costly
health problems. The price tag each year comes to nearly $50
billion for medical costs, lost income, lost productivity,
compensation payments and legal costs. </p>

<p>To the individual, the impact can be devastating both
personally and professionally. Severe pain can impair sleep and
appetite, and it can trigger anxiety, frustration and depression.
Over time, pain can lower self-esteem and bring on significant
psychological problems. Pain can destroy the will to live. </p>

<p>As common as it is, pain can be extremely elusive. The patient
may have difficulty describing it, and the physician often cannot
substantiate it. An individual in acute pain may scream and
writhe in agony; but the person with chronic pain often appears
outwardly normal, with few visible signs. </p>

<p>Although much remains to be learned about the mechanism of
pain, we know individuals have different levels of tolerance to
pain. There are also differences in individual sensitivity to
drugs, and in how drugs are metabolized. Studies indicate that
pain relief from opiates varies by age, race, cultural
differences, type of pain and location of pain. </p>

<p>Because the effectiveness of pain medication varies greatly
from person to person, a patient's need for a high dose is not
necessarily a sign of addiction. </p>

<p><b>Treatment of pain</b> </p>

<p>A variety of methods are used to treat chronic pain. They may
include acupuncture, biofeedback and other relaxation techniques,
physical therapy, psychotherapy, hypnosis, behavior modification,
nerve block by injection and transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS). In addition, cancer patients who suffer pain
may benefit from radiation therapy. Surgery can alter the
perception of pain, modify conduction of pain along pathways of
the central nervous system, or, as a last resort, block pain by
cutting nerve bundles. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents,
antidepressants and anticonvulsants are among the medications
that can be used. </p>

<p>Despite the variety of treatments available, a substantial
number of pain patients are not helped. Even some of those
'successfully treated must learn to live with pain. </p>

<p>Narcotics are extremely effective for pain relief, but their
long term use has been avoided because of the potential for
addiction. Included are &quot;opiates&quot; like morphine and
codeine, which are derived from opium, and &quot;opioids&quot;
like heroin and methadone, which are synthetic or semi-synthetic
compounds with similar properties. </p>

<p>Opiate therapy is now generally used for burn victims and
terminal cancer patients, and for shorter periods for hospital
patients who have undergone surgery. The standard prescription is
PRN (pro re nata, or &quot;as needed&quot;). In effect the order
means medication is to be given only after pain returns. </p>

<p>However, by the time the pain is treated, it may be so severe
that a larger dose, with greater side effects, is needed.
Undertreatment can occur when surgery patients have a longer
course of recovery than normal, and for young patients. </p>

<p><b>Regulatory efforts</b> </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics are noted not only for their ability to
relieve pain--but- also for their widespread abuse. </p>

<p>Attempts to curtail drug abuse have led to a wide range of law
enforcement activities. One of the most visible in the medical
setting is the system of triplicate prescriptions required for a
number of drugs. One copy of a prescription is retained by the
physician, a second sent to the pharmacist, and the third to the
Drug Enforcement Agency. Triplicate prescriptions are frequently
used to identify physicians who may be overprescribing. </p>

<p>Overprescribing of narcotics, stimulants and other drugs
accounts for almost 20 percent of the disciplinary actions taken
by the Medical Board of California (or MBC, formerly the Board of
Medical Quality Assurance). </p>

<p>In 1982, the physician who was then the MBC's medical
consultant declared in an interview sent out to all licensed
physicians in California: </p>

<p>&quot;We have two kinds of doctors who get into trouble (for
overprescribing narcotics)--'script doctors' and 'well
intentioned' doctors. The 'well-intentioned' doctor may appear as
a 'nice guy, I but he is really naive or, in some cases, not
keeping up with present day prescribing standards. The 'script
doctor' is one who usually knows he is breaking the law and
writes prescriptions for controlled substances purely for
profit.&quot; </p>

<p>He gave no indication that prescribing high amounts of
narcotics over the long term might be acceptable. </p>

<p><b>The traditional view</b> </p>

<p>The interview reflected the traditional view that long-term
narcotics use by anyone inevitably leads to addiction: the body
learns to tolerate the drugs, and demands ever escalating doses;
abuse begins as a search for euphoria, and eventually conditioned
reflexes cause an irresistible craving for the narcotic. This
escapist-conditioning explanation dominated medical thinking and
public health policy for three decades and is still widely held. </p>

<p>For example, a June, 1990, issue of the Mayo Clinic's Medical
Essay newsletter warns: </p>

<p>&quot;Opiates can cause drowsiness, nausea, constipation and
mood changes. In addition ' extended use of opiates can lead to
tolerance--the body becomes accustomed to certain amounts of the
drug and no longer responds as well to it. Because of the
inevitable addiction that accompanies chronic opiate use, their
use in treating pain should be extremely limited.&quot; </p>

<p>There are problems with that point of view. Some so-called
&quot;chippers&quot; who abuse drugs occasionally do not. become
addicted. </p>

<p>Many veterans of the Vietnam War used narcotics extensively
while overseas, but abruptly discontinued use after returning
home without subsequent readdiction. </p>

<p>It was discovered that long-term addicts could be maintained
with methadone at a high, though stable, dose. Individuals could
then function with minimal side effects. </p>

<p>Experience with cancer patients led to a major change in
thinking. Except for an initial increase in dose, there was
little evidence of growing tolerance to narcotics. </p>

<p>&quot;The cancer patient has thus served as a model to
demonstrate that opioids can be used on a chronic basis in
patients with pain, and this insight has given a greater insight
into the clinical pharmacology effects of these drugs,&quot;
writes neurologist Kathleen Foley in a 1990 monograph on pain
management. &quot;For example, chronic use of opioids in the
cancer patient has demonstrated that physical dependence occurs,
but psychological dependence or 'addiction' is rare, if not
nonexistent.&quot; </p>

<p>Many addicts claim to have been hooked by medical care, and
older studies indicated perhaps 10 percent of addicts started off
that way. However, a major study in 1980 showed abuse developed
in only 4 of 11,882 patients given opiates while hospitalized; in
only one instance was the abuse considered major. </p>

<p>In recent years, self-infusion pumps have been introduced
which allow patients after surgery to give themselves limited
doses of narcotics to control pain. There were fears the process
would create a new population of drug addicts. Instead, the
amount of narcotics used by patients has been the same or less
than under the old PRN method. </p>

<p><b>Emerging concepts</b> </p>

<p>It now seems clear there is a major difference between addicts
seeking euphoria and individuals seeking relief from pain. The
traditional perception is that the reactions of street addicts
are simply a more extreme expression of what happens to chronic
pain patients. </p>

<p>However, drug addicts behave as if obtaining and using drugs
are primary drives--akin to eating, sleeping or sex. They take
drugs to get high and are frequently lost to themselves, their
families and society. </p>

<p>In contrast, the person with chronic pain takes drugs to
return to normal and to get on with life. Narcotics allow
individuals with pain to interact with their families and to
return to work. Pain patients overcome most of the side effects
of the narcotics. </p>

<p>The pain patient's entire behavior is aimed at getting relief
from pain, just as the addict's efforts are aimed at obtaining
drugs. Unlike an addict, the typical pain patient experiences
little or no euphoria from narcotics. Except for an initial
increase in dosage, there is little indication of increasing
tolerance. Withdrawing from drugs is a major hurdle for addicts,
but for the pain patient withdrawal is typically uncomplicated. </p>

<p>Why the different reaction to opiates? chronic pain signals
travel to the brain by a different nerve pathway than do sudden
or &quot;Phasic&quot; pain signals. One prominent researcher
believes the chronic pathway develops relatively little tolerance
to morphine, so does not demand constantly escalating doses. </p>

<p><b>New definitions of abuse</b> </p>

<p>Along with recent medical developments have come redefinitions
of the key terms of drug abuse. All long-term users of narcotics
become physically dependent: if drugs are suddenly discontinued,
their bodies react with sweating, aches, nausea or other
withdrawal symptoms. That physical dependence was once virtually
synonymous with addiction, but is no longer. </p>

<p>The American Society of Addiction Medicine now defines
addiction as the abuse of any psychoactive substance with
compulsion and loss of control despite adverse consequences. </p>

<p>Similarly, an American Medical Association Task Force
describes addiction as a chronic disorder characterized by
&quot;the compulsive use of a substance-resulting in physical,
psychological or social harm to the user and continued use
despite the harm.&quot; &quot;Psychological dependence,&quot;
which emphasizes the compulsive use of drugs, is now often used
interchangeably with the term addiction. </p>

<p>Under the older definition, anyone who became physically
dependent could be viewed as an &quot;addict&quot;--including the
pain patient on narcotics. The newer definition distinguishes
between the pain patient trying to put a life back together and
the self-destructive addict trying to achieve euphoria. </p>

<p><b>Physicians and pain patients</b> </p>

<p>Despite the changing perceptions of pain and addiction,
physicians are generally ambivalent about the use of narcotics.
Most physicians were trained under older concepts of drug
addiction--as are many current medical students. Pain experts
today still disagree about the proper use of narcotics. </p>

<p>Even a supposedly safe practice--giving narcotics to terminal
cancer patients--has its own quandaries. It is sometimes
criticized for placing medical care nearer to euthanasia. In a
highly publicized case in early 1990, the morphine-related deaths
of two terminally ill patients in the Minneapolis area were ruled
by the coroner to be homicides. </p>

<p>There is constant pressure for more discipline of physicians.
A recent example is a draft report of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services which says data strongly suggest
&quot;the universe of potentially actionable events far exceeds
the number of disciplinary actions actually imposed by the
(state) boards.&quot; </p>

<p>Physicians are also aware of the ongoing disciplinary actions
against doctors for overprescribing drugs, usually narcotics. </p>

<p>As a consequence, many physicians simply limit the amount of
narcotics they will prescribe f or any one pain patient. Some
physicians even shy away from using any triplicate forms. The
forms are a paperwork nuisance and a red flag of danger. Not
having them is also a convenient excuse for not treating pain
patients. </p>

<p>Few doctors welcome patients who complain of chronic pain.
Pain patients often appear normal, so the physician cannot be
sure of the extent or validity of the complaints. The patients
are often difficult, manipulative or depressed. High levels of
medication to relieve pain invite disciplinary problems for the
physician. </p>

<p>Most physicians prescribe narcotics only f or chronic pain
patients they have treated for a number of years. Patients
receiving such medication face a major problem if they move to a
new area or their physician retires. New physicians will be
extremely reluctant to treat them. </p>

<p><b>Political developments</b> </p>

<p>The environment in which physicians and patients now find
themselves was captured by the theme of the October, 1989,
meeting of the American Pain Society, &quot;Relieving Pain in a
Regulated Environment--a Medical Dilemma for the 90's. &quot; The
meeting focused on the difficulties in treatment caused by the
ongoing war on drugs. </p>

<p>The Texas Legislature confronted the problem in 1989 by
enacting a law which defined &quot;intractable pain,&quot; added
to state law language from federal law recognizing the legitimate
medical use of dangerous drugs, and restricted discipline of
physicians for treating chronic intractable pain. </p>

<p>The California Legislature acted in 1989 as well, passing
senator Leroy Greene's SB 711 to set down new requirements before
the Board of Medical Quality Assurance (now known as the Medical
Board of California or MBC) could discipline a physician for
overprescribing. The Board would have to consider the physical
and mental condition of the patient, whether the patient had
intractable pain, whether there was evidence of drug addiction or
abuse, and whether the medication caused physical or
psychological harm to the patient. </p>

<p>However, the bill was vetoed at the Medical Board's urging.
The governor said he shared the board's concern the law would
reduce its ability to discipline physicians: &quot;By requiring
that the Board's investigations take into account certain
specific characteristics of the patient, particularly where the
patient may not be willing to cooperate for fear of losing a
supply of drugs, the bill places a significant new burden of
proof on the Board in its efforts to discipline physicians who
are excessive providers.&quot; </p>

<p>The Governor also pointed to the war on drugs: &quot;I believe
at a time when illicit access and use of drugs is a major problem
for our citizens, this bill's provisions are a step in the wrong
.direction.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1990, Senator Greene took a different, successful tack with
SB 1802. The bill said physicians could not be disciplined for
prescribing controlled substances to control &quot;intractable
pain.&quot; The Medical Board found the bill more acceptable than
the previous measure, but still thought there was no problem and
no need for legislation. </p>

<p>SB 1802 defined &quot;intractable pain&quot; as &quot;a pain
state in which the cause of the pain cannot be removed or
otherwise treated and which in the generally accepted course of
medical practice no relief or cure of the cause of the pain is
possible or none has been found after reasonable efforts
including, but not limited to, evaluation by one or more
physicians and surgeons specializing in the treatment of the
area, system, or organ of the body perceived as the source of the
pain. </p>

<p>The bill was signed into law by the Governor on September 30,
1990. Looking ahead </p>

<p>Hopefully, measures like the Greene bill will allow physicians
to better treat the patient disabled by chronic pain. one key
provision of that law requires consultation with other experts. </p>

<p>In addition, physicians should consider long-term narcotics
only after other reasonable attempts at pain relief have failed.
Patients should be seen and prescriptions given at regular
intervals. Physicians must be wary of the patient with a history
of drug abuse, the patient who does not have some initial relief
with relatively low doses of pain medication, or the patient who
hoards drugs or shows uncontrolled escalation of drug use. </p>

<p>Pain patients should be made aware of the risk of long-term
narcotic use. But those who need narcotics should understand that
physical dependence does not inevitably lead to addiction. The
odds are decidedly against addiction in the self-destructive
sense. </p>

<p>The medical community, regulatory bodies and the public need
to know that more can and should be done for treatment of chronic
pain. The emerging evidence indicates we can safely offer
patients more for pain than to &quot;learn to live with it.&quot;
