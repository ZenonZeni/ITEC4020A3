Investing in Technology</H2>

Technology --  a single word that is simultaneously capable of producing panic in the technophobics amongst us and elation and unbridled optimism among those that embrace it.  Those that are afraid seem to think they’ll never be able to keep up and they’re probably correct.  Those that embrace technology sense America’s dynamism, spirit of capitalism, and world leadership.  At times our portfolios are heavily concentrated in that broad industry classification known as "Technology."  
<P>
Consider for a moment the amount of technology that each of us depends upon every day.  Here’s a typical daily routine for me: 
<i>I awaken to a digital alarm clock, come downstairs to a hot pot of coffee made by an automatic coffee maker, and warm a muffin in the microwave.  I jump in my car (which has digital instrumentation, ABS brakes, and electronic fuel injection) and head for the gym.  At the gym I use either a Stairmaster or a treadmill; both of which have electronic displays of time, calories, etc.  Some days I’ll stop at an automatic teller to get a few bucks or at the gas station using one of the automatic credit card readers (both are faster than waiting in line).  At the office, I spend my entire day using a computer which is linked to a LAN (local area network) looking into a display doing research, checking quotes and account balances, and speaking with clients about our investment strategies.  I couldn’t even begin to convey to you the volume of information I’m exposed to daily.  Almost all of my 
contact is over the telephone.  Once I’m back home again, I’ll likely work in my home office for a few hours doing further investment research or browsing on the Internet.  My two young daughters have an Apple computer for which we’ve bought a number of educational CD-ROM’s and games.  Like most homes, we have cable TV and I’ll occasionally relax by watching a sitcom or movie.

Embedded microprocessors run the digital alarm clock, coffee maker, electronic fuel injection, and exercise equipment (Intel).  High speed telecommunications transport my banking and credit card information and provide cable TV broadcasts (Ascend, Cascade and Cisco).  Millions of lines of computer code run software applications that make all this technology run smoothly and quickly (Microsoft, Peoplesoft and HBO & Co.).  And  technology consulting firms provide the leadership and vision that allows Corporate America to embrace these technologies and make them a part of their products and services (Cambridge Technology Partners).
<P>
Technology has become ubiquitous in our lives.  Technology is so pervasive, broad, and differentiated that it can be broken into dozens of segments, many of which bear little resemblance to one another save for their common lineage of the silicon wafer.  Any portfolio should be a representation of the economy in which it invests.  A great portfolio will select those companies helping to craft and implement these vast technological advances.  Our goal is to position your assets not for the past but for the future.
