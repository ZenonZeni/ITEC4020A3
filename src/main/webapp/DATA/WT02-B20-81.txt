DEFINITION OF CEREBRAL PALSY<P>

     Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by damage to the brain,
usually occurring before,during or shortly following birth.
"Cerebral" refers to the brain and "palsy" to a disorder of
movement or posture.  It is neither progressive nor communicable.
It is also not "curable" in the accepted sense, although
education, therapy and applied technology can help persons with
cerebral palsy lead productive lives.  It is not a disease and
should never be  referred to as such.  It can range from mild to
severe.<P>

     The causes of cerebral palsy include illness during
pregnancy, premature delivery, or lack of oxygen supply to the
baby; or it may occur early in life as a result of an accident,
lead poisoning, viral infection, child abuse, or other factors.
Chief among the causes is an insufficient amount of oxygen or
poor flow of blood reaching the fetal or newborn brain.  This can
be caused by premature separation of the placenta, an awkward
birth position, labor that goes on too long or is too abrupt, or
interference with the umbilical cord.  Other causes may be
associated with premature birth, RH or A-B-O blood type
incompatibility between parents, infection of the mother with
German measles or other viral diseases in early pregnancy, and
microorganisms that attack the newborn's central nervous system.
Lack of good prenatal care may also be a factor. A less common
type is acquired cerebral palsy: head injury is the most frequent
cause, usually the result of motor vehicle accidents, falls, or
child abuse.<P>

  The School Experience for Gifted Students with Cerebral Palsy.<BR>

  This paper presents a study of two intellectually gifted students (ages 6 and 
14) who have cerebral palsy and are unable to communicate orally.  Results of 
participant observation, interviews, and document analysis revealed that: (1) 
gifted students who have cerebral palsy and do not speak exhibit indicators of 
cognitive ability that are similar to those exhibited by nondisabled gifted 
students, though the expression and recognition of these indicators are 
inhibited by communication barriers; (2) classroom atmosphere, structures, and 
instructional activities differentially impact the intellectual development of 
gifted students with physical disabilities; (3) gifted students with physical 
disabilities are able, with some modifications, to integrate and succeed 
academically and socially in regular classrooms; and (4) many barriers must be 
overcome by gifted students with physical disabilities in order to reach their 
goals.  The study demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the obvious 
external manifestations of intellectual talent and illustrates some unique 
behaviors that may appear given appropriate circumstances.  (Contains 22 
references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This fact sheet on cerebral palsy is offered in both English and Spanish.  
First, it provides a definition and considers various causes (e.g., an 
insufficient amount of oxygen reaching the fetal or newborn brain).  The fact 
sheet then offers incidence figures and explains characteristics of the three 
main types of cerebral palsy: spastic, athetoid, and ataxic.  It briefly 
discusses developmental, educational, and employment implications.  These 
include the value of early identification and intervention.  (DB)<BR>

  Children with cerebral palsy sometimes display nutritional inadequacy, as 
evaluated through anthropometric measurements and laboratory values.  Causes of 
poor nutritional status include inadequate calories offered or adequate 
calories offered but not consumed.  Inadequate caloric retention may be due to 
vomiting, rumination, or gastroesophageal reflux.  Refeeding is a possible 
intervention effort.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  One of a series of children's books written from the point of view of an 
elementary grade child with a disability or other problem, the stories 
emphasize similarities in childhood experience while providing information 
specific to the disability.  In this book, Mark, a fifth grader with cerebral 
palsy, has been reluctantly doing research on sewing machines for a school 
report.  He discovers that the money for his team's baseball jerseys that he 
has been responsible for is missing, and he finds himself feeling more friendly 
toward sewing machines.  After the story, a question and answer section 
provides answers (by Mark) of typical questions children often have about 
cerebral palsy.  These include: "Why are you in a wheelchair?" "What is 
cerebral palsy?" "What is it like to have CP?" "Does having CP mean that you're 
crippled or handicapped? Does it matter what people call you?" "But how can you 
play baseball in a wheelchair?" "Can you play other sports?" "Isn't it hard to 
get around in a wheelchair?" "Can you go real fast in your wheelchair?" "Why do 
you talk funny?" "Why do you wear a helmet?" "Will you get better?" "Are you 
sad that you have CP?" (DB)<BR>

  Intended for professionals and parents, this monograph focuses on the service 
needs of young children with cerebral palsy.  Section I presents an overview of 
cerebral palsy, including etiology, incidence, and history of management.  
Section II describes service needs in the following areas: prevention; early 
identification; treatment; the interdisciplinary team; primary, secondary, and 
tertiary care; community support services; links with educational services; and 
training for health professionals.  Section III discusses coordination of 
services in the context of decision-making and prevention planning.  A short 
appendix lists references for further reading.  (JW)<BR>
