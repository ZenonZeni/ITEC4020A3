Inc. to link Lord, Abbett &amp; Co. Directly to Nasdaq</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>PITTSBURGH, Pa. - July 16, 1996 - </B>Confluence Technologies,
a Pittsburgh-based provider of software for the mutual fund industry
announced today the installation of its flagship software product,
FundStation, at Lord, Abbett &amp; Co. in New York. This installation
provides Lord Abbett the ability to automatically transmit its
funds' net asset values (NAVs) and other pricing information directly
to the Nasdaq via its Computer To Computer Interface (CTCI). 
<BR>
<P>
Caroline Sussman, Relationship Manager for Confluence Technologies,
says, &quot;With FundStation, Lord Abbett has replaced the rush
to rekey daily pricing information into Nasdaq terminals by 5:40
p.m. with the automated delivery of this information to Nasdaq
as soon as it is ready. The same technology can also automate
the delivery of Lord Abbett's pricing information to any number
of other places, including customers, a transfer agent, a voice
response unit, or even the Internet.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;We believe that we can satisfy our customers best by automating
as much of the daily pricing distribution as possible,&quot; said
John Gargana, Chief Financial Officer at Lord Abbett. &quot;Adding
FundStation to our daily processing routine gives us one more
opportunity to focus our time and effort where it counts - on
customer service.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Confluence Technologies, Inc., sells FundStation, a client/server
PC application for mutual fund accounting and administration areas
that automatically collects daily pricing information, calculates
rates of returns and yields, and distributes data in any format
to any destination. Confluence Technologies is a Microsoft Solution
Provider, a member of the Pittsburgh High Technology Council and
a service member of the National Investment Company Service Association.
