<h2 align=center>Neuroimaging in Learning Disabilities<br>and
Developmental Disorders</h2>
The area of neuroimaging is developing methods to visualize brain areas
in functioning states. Procedures for functional stimulation permit
differentiation between control and learning disabled brain function.
Specific methods and specific probes are providing new views of the
functioning and dysfunctional brain, but expectations and limitations
must be kept in sharp perspective.

<p>Functional MRI is providing new information about areas of the brain
normally and abnormally involved in the processing of sensory
information, social competence and of verbal and nonverbal learning.
Brain imaging has provided anatomical insights into the areas where
learning disabilities can occur. Some learning disabilities are well
known, but  until recently have had no established neurological or
anatomical basis. This panel of presenters represents leadership in the
technological ability to functionally localize brain areas of unusual
development that underlie verbal and nonverbal learning disabilities and
attention deficits. 

<p>Functional MRI has provided direct imaging of brain regions involved
in reading in normal individuals. It has provided new details about
patterns of brain areas involved in different types of readers and how
those areas differ in dyslexia. Large scale studies of young people with
attention deficits show brain regions that are focally underdeveloped
compared to controls. Developmental norms for PET, functional MRI and
standard MRI are just developing. The symposium provides direct and
empirical information about the actual (not theoretical) organization of
brain regions serving learning, language, social competence and attention
functions.
