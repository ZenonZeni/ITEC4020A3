New Instrumentation Detects Toxic Gases

GMD Systems, Inc. (Old Route 519, Hendersonville, PA 15339; Tel
412/746-3600 or 800/736-4666, Fax 412/746-1359) has commercialized
its Remote Intelligent Sensor (RIS) for the detection of toxic
gases such as hydrazines, phosgene, and isocyanates.  William T.
Hughes, Product Manager, told us that the RIS is a highly accurate,
single point, fixed position area monitor expandable into a network
of up to 120 sensors connected by a 2-way communications link, and
computer-supervised from a central location.  Since each RIS also
retains "stand alone" capability, the units can continue to operate
during power outages or computer failures.  The RIS employs a
quick-response, microprocessor-controlled sensing system that uses
a combination of colorimetric paper tape, cassettes, and electro-
optics.  GMD is an affiliate of Bacharach, Inc. (625 Alpha Drive,
Pittsburgh, PA 15238; Tel 412/963-2000, Fax 412/963-2091).

Sierra Monitor Gas Sensors Employ Four Sensing Technologies

Sierra Monitor Corporation (SMC, 1991 Tarob Court, Milpitas, CA
95035; Tel 408/262-6611, Fax 408/262-9042) offers 4 sensor
technologies to match the best gas sensor performance with
application requirements.  Catalytic bead sensors are used to
monitor combustible gases.  The sensor provides reliable zero
stability and a linear response to combustible gas over a wide
temperature range.  The sensor consists of 2 alumina beads each
surrounding a platinum wire operating at approximately 450 C.  One
bead is passivated so it will not react with combustible gas.  The
other bead is catalyzed to promote a reaction with combustible gas.
Effects of changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity are
nullified by placing the two beads in separate legs of a wheatstone
bridge circuit.  When the catalyzed bead reacts with the
combustible gas, it heats up, which increases its resistance.
This, in turn, increases the output of the wheatstone bridge
circuit used as the sensor signal.

Stephen R. Ferree, Vice President - Marketing, told us that SMC's
semiconductor sensors have a resistance in air which is affected by
oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the sensor.  Oxygen atoms capture
electrons on the semiconductor surface, thereby increasing its
resistance.  The sensors may be impregnated with dopants such that,
when the sensor's resistance changes, specific gases displace the
adsorbed oxygen.  For example, SMC's thin film metal oxide sensor
does not respond when exposed to 5% methane in air.  Other
semiconductor sensors are available for combustible gases, carbon
monoxide, and ammonia.

Electrochemical sensors are fuel cell-like devices consisting of an
anode, cathode, and electrolyte.  The components of the cell are
selected so that a subject gas allowed to diffuse into the cell
will cause a chemical reaction and generate a current.  The cells
are diffusion limited so the rate at which the gas enters the cell
is solely dependent on the gas concentration.  The current
generated is proportional to the rate of consumption of the subject
gas in the cell.  Unlike electrochemical sensors, where gas
diffuses through membranes into the cell, SMC sensors allow gas to
diffuse into the sensor through a simple capillary.  The result is
a stable sensor with low pressure and temperature coefficients and
the capability to measure gas as a % by volume.

In SMC infrared (IR) sensors, gas molecules absorb IR light within
a narrow, characteristic wavelength.  Light is emitted from an IR
source and passed through the gas to be analyzed.  The amount of
absorption corresponds directly to the gas concentration.

SMC gas sensor modules condition the sensor signal and provide an
industry standard 4-20 mA output that can interface with single-
and multiple-channel controllers and distributed control systems.
Gases monitored by SMC modules include ammonia, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, chlorine, combustible gases, hydrogen, hydrogen
sulfide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and sulfur
dioxide.

HNU Systems Uses Photoionization to Measure Gases

HNU Systems, Inc. (160 Charlemont St., Newton, MA 02161-9987; Tel
617/964-6690 800/724-5600, Fax 617/558-0056) Model 201 continuous
gas monitors allow the long term monitoring of volatile organic
compounds (VOC's).  Brian Sheppard, National Sales Manager, told us
that the instruments are suited for the continuous measurement of
process streams, stack gas, or ambient air.  They use the
photoionization detection principle, which provides measurements
accurate to sub parts per million (ppm) levels.  The instruments
can often measure over a range of 0.1 ppm to 2000 ppm, with higher
ranges available upon request.  An ultra-stable, sealed ultraviolet
(UV) light source used as an ionization source, plus electronic
circuitry, provide instrument stability and repeatability.  Also
unusual is the mechanical simplicity of these photoionization
instruments (the meter movement and the sampling pump are the only
moving parts) which helps to ensure stability.  By employing the
photoionization detection principle, the Model 201 instruments
eliminate other problems common to older techniques.  There are no
optics, lenses, or mirrors involved, which eliminates periodic
alignment and coating.  There are no flames that can go out nor any
flow regulators  needed, since photoionization is independent of
flow, and there are no compressed gases required for operation.

Photoionization analyzers can be used to monitor a wide variety of
organic and some inorganic gases.  Aromatics, ketones, chlorinated
hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, reduced sulfur compounds,
phosphine, ammonia, iodine, and hydrazine are among the gases which
can be measured.  The photoionization principle of operation
includes the absorption of UV light by a molecule which leads to
ionization via: R + hn  = R+ + e- where R+ is the ionized species
and hn represents a photon which has an energy greater than the
ionization potential of the species.  The sensor consists of a
sealed UV light source that emits photons which are energetic
enough to ionize many trace species (particularly organics) but do
not ionize the major components of air such as oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water.  A chamber adjacent to
the UV source contains a pair of electrodes.  When a positive
potential is applied to one electrode, the created field drives any
ions formed by the absorption of UV light to the collector
electrode where the current (proportional to the concentration) is
measured.

Air Instruments & Measurements' Model 8000 Can Measure Up to 6
Gases in Real Time

Air Instruments & Measurements, Inc. (AIM, 13111 Brooks Dr. Suite
D, Baldwin Park, CA 91706-7901; Tel 818/813-1460 or 800/969-4AIM,
Fax 818/338-2585) has introduced its Model 8000 open-path analyzer
to measure up to 6 gases in real time across an extended (100 feet
or more) path length.  Raj Adani, National Sales Manager, told us
that the system is based on the company's double-pass optical
system which features automatic self-calibration with an internal
reference mirror and sealed gas cells and/or bandpass filters for
a known up-scale response.  The system is mounted in a sealed,
double-ended enclosure, and the sensor assembly includes a
thermostatted heater for weather protection.  Optional cooling is
also available.  The retroreflector end is passive, with no
electrical or moving parts, eliminating the need for thermal or
explosion protection.  AIM says the system is particularly well
suited for the detection of leaks and spills of hazardous, toxic,
corrosive, and/or condensable gases since it measures the sample in
place in the air with no sample contact.  Measurable gases include
HF, HCl, HCOH, benzene, toluene, vinyl chloride, CH4, NO, N2O, SO2,
CO, CO2, NH3, HCN, and water.

Legislated Acid Rain Requirements Will Reduce Fine  Particulate
Emissions

EPA, Congress and environmentalists will be pleasantly surprised to
learn that the scrubbers being installed to reduce acid rain will
also reduce fine particulate air pollution by 20,000 to 40,000 tons
per year.  These conclusions are contained in a new report issued
by the McIlvaine Company (Northbrook, IL) entitled  Heavy Metal
Removal from Coal-Fired Boilers .

There is renewed concern that fine particulate is the most serious
air pollution problem.  The utility industry is the largest
stationary source emitter.  The old coal-fired plants are not
regulated as to particulate emissions by any federal laws.  The new
SO2 reduction requirements for these plants allow either fuel
switching or scrubbers.  Scrubbers capture 80% of the fine
particulate (not captured by the precipitators) along with the SO2.
Most utilities are fuel switching in Phase 1, so this impressive
fine particulate reduction will be accomplished by only 15,000 MW
of scrubbers.

Scrubbers have the further benefit of removing air toxics.
Scrubbers would also remove 20,000 to 60,000 tons per year of
chlorine and 7000 to 8000 tons per year of fluorine.  The scrubbers
would also remove the toxic heavy metals which are measured in
pounds per year instead of tons per year.  The scrubbers would
remove 12,000 to 36,000 pounds/year of mercury and 13,000 to 42,000
pounds of chromium.  Even greater quantities of lead and manganese
would be captured.  Equal or smaller quantities of arsenic,
selenium, cadmium and other toxics would also be removed.

Liquid Fuels from Coal-Derived Synthesis Gas

Coal-derived syngas can be converted to methanol using liquid phase
methanol synthesis (LPMeOH) process.  Methanol can be further
converted to gasoline using the Mobil methanol-to-gasoline (MTG)
process.  The combination of syngas-to-methanol technology with the
MTG process thus provides a ready synthetic route for liquid
hydrocarbon fuels.  Sunggyu Lee and Conrad F. Kulik (Department of
Chemical Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325)
have developed a process for one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether
(DME) from syngas.  This DME process improves the reactor
productivity and syngas conversion by as much as 100% over the
LPMeOH process.  One-step DME synthesis is thus an ideal front end
for further conversion to gasoline.  This substitution is justified
not only because DME yields an identical product distribution as
methanol, but DME is also a true intermediate in the MTG process.
The integration scheme has been termed the dimethyl  ether-to-
gasoline (DTG) process.  The advantages of the UA/EPRI process over
the conventional MTG process are in enhanced syngas conversion,
superior hydrocarbon yield and selectivity, and integrated energy
efficiency.  The researchers summarized their work in a paper
delivered at the 206th American Chemical Society (ACS) National
Meeting in Chicago, IL August 22-27, 1993.

Biodiesel Offers Environmental and Economic Advantages

Biodiesel fuel is produced by esterifying vegetable oils or animal
fats by reacting them with methanol in the presence of a catalyst
to produce methyl ester.  Its major attraction, besides its reduced
emissions characteristics, is its ease of use.  As opposed to
natural gas or electric power, biodiesel fuel can power existing
diesel engines with no modifications.  The Comprehensive National
Energy Policy Act of 1992 raised the expectations of the industry
since it redefined and broadened the term "alternative" fuel to
include any fuel "substantially not petroleum."

In May 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
provisionally approved petitions to register methyl soyate and
methyl tallowate as motor fuels and fuel additives permitting their
sale in that capacity.  Final approval depends upon research
demonstrating that methyl soyate and methyl tallowate are
"substantially similar" to diesel fuel.  While biodiesel fuel
reduces carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, and particulate emissions, it
is an oxygenated fuel and, accordingly, increases nitrous oxide
emissions.  Some industry sources expect EPA to consider each
emissions category separately instead of evaluating it for its
aggregate emissions reduction capability.  Such a decision could
jeopardize biodiesel's "substantially similar" designation.

The American Biofuels Association (ABA) expects mass transit to
provide most biodiesel activity over the next 5 or so years as EPA
urban fleet emissions requirements take effect in January 1995.
Since biodiesel is priced at $2.50-3.00/gallon, the ABA is pushing
for tax exemptions and credits at both the federal and state levels
to make the fuel competitive with conventional diesel fuel and
ethanol and bio-based methanol.  The ABA estimates that 3.4 billion
gallons of biodiesel could be produced annually in the U.S., which
would place land now idled by agricultural subsidies back into
production.  Excess soybean oil and yellow grease stocks would also
be utilized.

Waste Incineration Technology Produces Syngas

The Thermoselect waste incineration process gasifies unsorted
municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce syngas,  which is scrubbed
and fired in a conventional gas engine to generate electricity.
This results in significantly less waste gas emissions than in
traditional MSW incinerators, claims developer Thermoselect S.A.
(Locarno, Switzerland).  A demonstration plant at Verbania, Italy
has been operating at 100 metric tons/day of MSW and generating a
net positive balance of 300 kW.  Emissions per metric ton of waste
burned are lower than the proposed European Community (EC)
emissions standard, with actual emissions of 90 kg of hydrogen
chloride and 1 kg each of dust, hydrogen fluoride, mercury, and
cadmium.  The volume of unsorted waste is first reduced by a factor
of 10 in a conventional press.  The compressed waste is then fed
into a 600 C coking oven, where metals and inorganic substances
form a solid matrix with the charred organics.  Following a
residence time of 1-2 hours, the solid matrix is fed directly to a
gasifier at 2000 C to convert the organics to syngas and to liquefy
the inorganics and metals.  Each metric ton of MSW yields 30 kg of
recyclable metal, 250 kg of vitrified slag, and 600 kg of syngas.

Quantum Considers Increasing Methanol Production

Quantum Chemical Corp. (99 Park Ave., New York, NY 10016; Tel
212/949-5000) has taken its LaPorte, TX methanol plant off the
market.  The unit, which has a capacity of 200 million
gallons/year, is operating at only 100 million gallons/year due
mainly to a shortage of hydrogen feedstock.  The company says the
move is unrelated to its pending acquisition by Hanson PLC (1
Grosvenor Pl., London SW1X 7JH, England).  The company is studying
options to increase the output of the plant to respond to a
perceived increase in demand for methanol stemming from oxygenated
gasoline requirements.

Ceramic Engine Fueled by Methanol

A compact, low polluting ceramic engine which runs on methanol has
been designed by the Kanagawa Academy of Science and Technology
Foundation (3-2-1 Sakado, Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Pref.
213, Japan; Tel +81 44 819 2043, Fax +81 44 819 2027).  It is
claimed to be about 30% more fuel efficient and to perform
similarly to a comparable diesel engine.  The prototype engine has
4 cylinders and a displacement of 2000 cc.  It occupies about 20%
less space than a diesel engine in the same class and weighs about
150 kg.  It is air cooled and can withstand temperature differences
of 800 C between the interior and exterior surfaces of the
cylinders.

Allied-Signal Increases the Production of CFC Alternatives

Allied-Signal (Box 2245, Morristown, NJ 07962; Tel 201/455-2000)
has completed a 6-month expansion program at its El Segundo, CA
facility as part of a $250 million investment in the development
and commercialization of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements.
The company has doubled its annual capacity to 50 million pounds,
for hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141b, which is used as a
replacement for CFC-11 as a blowing agent in insulating foams.
HCFC-141b is also used in new Allied-Signal specialty solvents.

The company expects to start full-scale commercial production of
Genetron AZ-50, a mixture of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-125 and (HFC)-
143a, at its Baton Rouge, LA facility in June 1994.  Allied-Signal
has also received Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approval of the
product, certifying it for use with UL-approved equipment.
Genetron AZ-50 is a replacement for the refrigerant R-502, a
mixture of CFC-115 and HCFC-22.

AT&T and Chrysler to Eliminate CFC Usage

Chrysler Corporation (12000 Chrysler Dr., Highland Park, MI 48288;
Tel 313/956-5741, Fax 313/956-1462) says that it will eliminate
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-12 refrigerant from air conditioning
systems in all Chrysler-built vehicles by January 1, 1994, two
years ahead of Federal mandates and faster than previously
announced.  "We've moved as aggressively as possible in removing R-

air conditioning systems using R-134a is in the best interests of
our customers and the environment," said Ronald R. Boltz,
Chrysler's Vice-President for Product Strategy and Regulatory
Affairs.  Chrysler reports that it is already using 134a on more
than 750,000 of its 1993 model year cars, the most of any automaker
selling vehicles in the U.S.  In addition to efforts on new cars,
Chrysler says that it is taking steps to help consumers with older
cars.  It is developing a CFC-free "drop-in" substitute with
Intermagnetics General Corporation (Box 566, Guilderland, NY 12084;
Tel 518/456-5456), which it says looks promising based on
preliminary data.

Separately, AT&T (550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022; Tel
212/605-5500) says that it has ended the use of all Class 1 ozone-
depleting materials from its consumer and business manufacturing
operations.  In 1986 AT&T's manufacturing operations emitted 2.5
million pounds of CFC's.

Disagreement Surfaces over HCFC and Methyl Bromide Bans

European proposals for controlling ozone-depleting
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and methyl bromide have provoked
disagreement from several companies and countries.  The proposals,
which were finalized on June 9, 1993, are undergoing examination by
European experts.  These proposals stipulate the banning of HCFC's
by 2015 and a production and usage freeze on methyl bromide
starting January 1, 1996.  France, the only European Community (EC)
country where methyl bromide is produced, is anxious to protect its
industry and is unwilling to apply measures more stringent than
those of the Montreal Protocol.

The major corporate opposition in France stems from Elf Atochem
(Paris, France), Europe's only methyl bromide producer.  The
company is participating in a $400,000 program to develop
technology to prevent emissions of the gas, which is used primarily
as a soil fumigant.  Elf Atochem's 1990 methyl bromide production
was 5000 metric tons; European consumption of 14,000 metric tons
was met by imports from the U.S. and Israel.  Worldwide methyl
bromide production is about 65,000 metric tons per year.  The U.S.
plans to ban methyl bromide in 2000.  Accordingly, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting accelerated
reviews to methyl bromide alternatives.

Southern EC member countries Spain, Portugal, and Greece also
oppose the HCFC phaseout part of the plan.  Belgium, which has
minor reservations, supports the plan, along with Italy, the U.K.,
and Ireland.  Denmark, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany
want an even faster HCFC phaseout.

U.S. CFC Users Seek Exemptions

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has received about
20 requests from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) users seeking exemption
from the ban on the production of the ozone-depleting chemicals
which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1996.  When they
voted in November 1992 to accelerate the phaseout of CFC's, the
parties to the Montreal Protocol On Substances That Deplete the
Ozone Layer included provisions for exemptions for essential uses.
Each country must formally nominate potential exempt uses to a
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) technical review
committee.  By its July 19, 1993 deadline, EPA had received 5
requests for exemptions for medical devices and 3 for refrigeration
or air conditioning uses, according to Nina Bonnelycke of EPA's
Substitutes Analysis and Review Branch.  Other exemption requests
were for the use of CFC's in analytical tests, as leak detectors
for nuclear submarines and power plants, in adhesives, in a wasp
killer, and in the manufacture of small caliber ammunition.  The
EPA will convene an interagency review group to decide which
applications warrant forwarding to UNEP.  In order to receive an
exemption, petitioners must demonstrate that the  use of CFC's is
critical to the functioning of society; that no alternatives are
technically, economically, or legally viable; and that no recycled
CFC's are available.

Ceramic-Based Catalysts Reduce NOx Emissions

Cormetech, Inc. (Treyburn Corporate Park, 5000 International Drive,
Durham, NC 27712; Tel 919/620-3000, Fax 919/620-3001) produces
ceramic-based extruded honeycomb catalysts for nitrogen oxide (NOx)
removal from coal-, oil-, or gas-fired stationary combustion
systems, such as utility and industrial boilers and gas turbines.
End users include electric utilities, petroleum refiners, and
chemical producers.  The homogeneous, titania-based, selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts resist heat and chemical
attack.  In the SCR process, ammonia is injected into the flue gas,
where it reacts with NOx in the presence of the catalyst to form
nitrogen and water.  SCR systems have no moving parts and produce
no by-products.  When used in SCR systems at 400-1000 F, they can
remove more than 90% of NOx emissions.  The honeycomb structure of
Cormetech's high surface area titanium dioxide catalysts maximizes
catalytic activity while minimizing gas flow resistance.  Each
catalyst element is 150 mm square and can be provided in lengths up
to 1000 mm.  Variations in catalyst composition and cellular
structure are determined by the nature of each application,
especially the type of fuel being burned.  Catalysts are engineered
for each application to minimize erosion and exposure to plugging.

Gerhard F. Koenig, President and CEO, says that Cormetech can
simulate flue gas conditions, including space and linear velocity
relationships, at its in-house pilot testing facilities.  Bench-
scale "micro-test" reactors are part of the company's resources for
use in catalyst manufacturing process control or when limited
representative sampling is needed.  Flow modeling technology is
also available from Cormetech and permits gas flow simulation of
conditions encountered in the plant, including conditions in the
reactor itself.  Flow modeling options include cold flow techniques
as well as computer modeling.  The company can perform and
recommend system design modifications such as installation of
static mixers, vanes, and other devices to reduce gas flow
variations.  Reducing variations optimizes the efficiency of the
catalyst while preventing erosion and plugging, i.e., information
derived from the flow modeling permits "conditioning" of the flue
gas before it reaches the catalyst to optimize catalyst
performance.  The company delivered catalysts during the summer of
1993 for the U.S.'s first large utility retrofit using SCR
technology.  The project involved 2 power plants in southern
California.  Cormetech was formed in 1989 by Corning, Inc.
(Houghton  Park, Corning, NY 14831; Tel 607/974-9000) Mitsubishi

Air Products Unveils NOx and N2O Reduction Technologies

Research scientists at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (7201
Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18195-1501; Tel 215/481-4911)
have discovered two catalytic technologies to reduce industrial
pollution.  One of the technologies reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emissions from stationary and mobile sources, while the other
prevents nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from certain chemical
processes from entering the atmosphere.

The NOx technology employs metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts, along
with methane in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, to convert NOx to
nitrogen gas, carbon oxides, and water.  The company says that the
process offers an environmentally and potentially economically
attractive alternative to currently available NOx removal
technology that uses ammonia for reducing emissions from stationary
sources, such as industrial boilers or natural gas-fueled power
stations.  Methane used in the Air Products process is already
available at many facilities which emit NOx, and their NOx-
containing exhaust streams typically contain high levels of oxygen.
Air Products' John N. Armor said that the technology may also lead
to improved catalysts for removing NOx from mobile engine
emissions.

The company's technology for removing N2O emissions from off-gases
of certain chemical processes uses a different family of metal
loaded zeolite catalysts that decompose N2O into its benign
components, gaseous nitrogen and oxygen.  These catalysts are said
to be long-lived and stable over a broad (200-800 C) temperature
range.  In addition, some of the catalysts readily destroy N2O in
the presence of water vapor.  Air Products' Yuejin Li said that
these characteristics make the technology especially suitable for
the clean-up of off-gases from major sources of N2O emissions
formed during the manufacture of nitric acid and nylon-66.  Since
the "industrial revolution" began, the concentration of N2O in the
atmosphere has been steadily increasing about 0.2% per year.
Because the gas has an atmospheric lifetime of about 150 years, the
need exists to develop a commercially viable process for its
decomposition.

Technology Reviewed for Catalytic NOx Reduction

A large amount of equipment is in operation which uses ammonia in
V2O5-TiO2-W(Mo)O2 system (the selective catalytic reduction, or
SCR, method) to remove high temperature nitrogen oxides (NOx) from
generating sources, such as boilers and incinerators.  In these
systems, even when oxygen of high concentration is present, ammonia
reacts selectively with the nitrogen oxide (NO) and the reaction is
accelerated.  A conventional SCR process uses V2O5-TiO2 as the
catalyst.

Some European systems using zeolites are in operation, with about
50% applied on diesel engines.  This equipment is said to have
several advantages, including operation over a broad temperature
range (300-480 C), the ability to use either 25% ammonia solution
or pure ammonia gas as the reducing agent, the use of monolithic
ceramic catalysts containing no heavy metals, the absence of
sulfuric acid generation due to the low oxidizing capacity of SO2,
the storage capacity of NH3 and NOx is large enough to withstand
partial pressure fluctuations, and long catalyst life.

All SCR processes use ammonia to react with NO.  Problems of
untreated ammonia are being addressed by a research group at
Japan's Hokkaido University.  The group is evaluating a process
which uses hydrocarbons as reducing agents.  Their research is
fully described in the Japanese High Technology Monitor, Vol. 11,
No. 10.

Reduction Process

Goal Line Environmental Technologies (GLET, Box 58324, 2045 East
Vernon Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90058; Tel 213/233-2224, Fax
213/233-7428) has filed a patent application for its SCONOx
technology.  GLET President Robert Danziger told us that the SCONOx
process cost effectively reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon
monoxide (CO) to below measurable levels at natural gas-fired power
plants.  The technology oxidizes nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), which is then absorbed and recycled into the power
plant's engine.  GLET is a co-venture of Sunlaw Energy Corporation
(Los Angeles, CA) and Advanced Catalyst Systems (Knoxville, TN).
Sunlaw, which operates two of the ten largest power plants in the
Los Angeles basin, plans to install a full-scale SCONOx system by
the end of 1993 and a second system in June 1994.

Catalyst-Coated Panels Can Reduce NOx Levels

High-rise buildings and sound barriers lining highways may act as
scavengers of 20% of such "greenhouse" gases as nitrogen oxides
(NOx) if the walls and sidings are coated with a mixture of
titanium oxide, activated carbon, and a  small amount of iron (III)
oxide.  In laboratory-scale tests at Japan's National Institute for
Resources and Environment (NIRE, Tsukuba, Ibaraki Pref., Japan),
panels coated with such catalysts have removed more than 90% of NOx
from a 0.05 parts per million (ppm) stream under irradiation,
equivalent to conditions on a cloudy day, by near-ultraviolet
light.  Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are oxidized
by TiO2 to NO2 and NO3-, respectively.  The activated carbon
component serves to fix the NO-derived NO2 so that it can be
further oxidized to NO3-.  In practice, rain water will wash the
NO3- off the panels.  In a country with Japan's level of rainfall
(1.5 m annually), only a slight decrease in the pH of any runoff,
equivalent to about 10 ppm, is expected, according to NIRE.  A 5-
year project to develop a viable technology began in April 1993.

Alumina Catalyst Aids Low Temperature NOx Reduction

Cosmo Oil Co. Ltd. (1-1 Shibaura 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105,
Japan; Tel 03-798-3211) has succeeded in keeping nitrogen oxides
(NOx) particles from diesel engine exhaust to less than 100 parts
per million (ppm) for more than 2000 hours by utilizing a honeycomb
alumina catalyst and alcohol as the reducing agent.  The company
considers this an important first step in the practical use of the
technology for the difficult job of controlling NOx emissions in
the presence of high-concentrations of oxygen.  Cosmo plans to
continue the research and testing in an effort to raise the under
100 ppm time interval from 2000 to 4000 hours.  The company also
has targeted the 200kW diesel engine of a cogeneration system for
demonstration testing.  The technology features low temperature
(300-400 C) NOx removal to minimize the deterioration of the
catalyst due to steam.  Sakai Chemical Industry Co. (Ebisujima-cho
5-chome, Sakai City, Osaka Pref. 590, Japan; Tel 0722-23-4111) and
several diesel engine manufacturers are also participating in the
test work.  The technology was first developed by Japan's National
Institute of Materials and Chemical Research and its Petroleum
Energy Center.

Pulp and Paper Process Reduces Sulfur and Chlorine Emissions

Formic acid and hydrogen peroxide replace sulfur- and chlorine-
based compounds in the cooking and bleaching steps of a pulp and
paper process under development by Kemira Oy (Helsinki, Finland).
The driving forces behind the Milox technology have been
legislative mandates in Europe and the U.S. to reduce chlorine
emissions from wastewater and to remove sulfur compounds from waste
gases.  The Milox process is in operation in a 150 kg/h pilot plant
and, says the company, could be in operation in a 5000-10,000
metric tons/year demonstration plant by 1995.  Lignin, the gum that
binds the cellulose fibers in wood, is removed by reaction with
hydroxonium ions (H3O+) in 3 stages.  The first and last stages are
carried out at 80 C in a solution of 80 wt % peroxyacetic acid,
formed by the reaction of H2O2 and HCOOH, while the second stage is
an 80 wt % solution of HCOOH at 100 C.  Milox pulp produces paper
of similar quality and brightness to chlorine-bleached kraft pulp,
says Kemira.

German Process Cuts SO2 and HCl Emissions

Caldyn Apparatebau GmbH (Ettlingen, Germany) has devised a process
for cutting sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen chloride emissions to
20 parts per million (ppm), well below the 100 ppm German limit.
The company claims that the process consumes only 33-50% of the
lime required by competitive processes.  Flue gas enters a dryer at
250-1000 C where it is sprayed with 50 mm diameter lime particles.
In this step, the lime is completely consumed, reducing SO2
concentration by 70%.  Following de-dusting, the gases are washed
in a second scrubber that combines an additional nozzle-sprayed
lime slurry with a water aerosol.  At this step, the lime
concentration, 70%, is 7 times higher than in competitive
processes, reducing the scrubber size by 50%.  Following a final
de-dusting step, the gases are released.  In addition to the
company's 500 m3/h mobile pilot plant, Caldyn has installed a 3200
m3/h system on a chemical waste incinerator in Bonn, Germany, which
started in June 1993.  Negotiations are in progress for a 44,000
m3/h unit for an incinerator at an animal feed plant in eastern
Germany.

Natural Gas Technology Cuts NOx Emissions

Institute of Gas Technology (IGT, 3424 South State Street, Chicago,
IL 60616; Tel 312/949-3650, Fax 312/949-3700) in tests at the
Anchor Glass plant in Huntington Park, CA  confirmed that an
advanced glass melting technology is effective in reducing nitrogen
oxides (NOx) emissions.  Hamid A. Abbasi, IGT's Assistant Director
- Applied Combustion Research, told us that the technology uses
staged natural gas combustion with oxygen enrichment to lower NOx
levels below 3 pounds of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) per ton of glass
produced.  A consortium of gas utilities led by Southern California
Gas Company and the Gas Research Institute is supporting the
development of this technology.  The process does not increase
natural gas consumption, and oxygen requirements are low (less than
5% of stoichiometric) for operating conditions that reduce NOx
remissions below the Southern California regulation of 4 pounds of
NO2 per ton of glass produced.  To demonstrate the stating concept,
IGT and its commercial partners, Combustion Tec, Inc. (Box 607693,
Orlando, FL 32860; Tel 407/299-7317) and Air Products and Chemicals
(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA  18195; Tel 215/481-4911), made
only minor modifications to a 165 ton/day glass melter.  Glenn C.
Neff, President - Combustion Tec, said that the changes are
transparent to furnace operators, and no adverse effects on the
quality of container glass have been observed.  According to Buddy
Eleazer, Air Products' Technology Manager - Glass Applications,
three months of additional testing are now under way to acquire
design data for the commercial introduction of the technology.

Ammonia Injection Lowers Engine NOx Emissions

James W. Davis (277 Kavenish Dr., Rancho Mirage, CA 92270) has been
assigned a patent for a method of reducing engine pollutants,
particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The process described in US
Patent 5,224,346, issued to Lester P. Berriman, John M. Zabsky,
James W. Davis, and William M. Hylton on July 6, 1993, involves the
injection of ammonia into a conduit between the cylinder exhaust
valves and the catalytic converter.  Ammonia injection occurs far
enough downstream of the exhaust valves to avoid burning of the
ammonia and at a location where the exhaust gases are at a
temperature of at least 1200 F.  The ammonia reacts with the NOx in
the exhaust gases prior to the gases reaching the catalytic
converter, which eases the load on the catalyst.  To minimize
ammonia use, it is injected only one minute or so after cold engine
startup when the catalyst is too cold to be effective and during
operation of the engine at high power levels, when the greatest
amounts of NOx are produced.

phase shifting of both the intake and exhaust valve timing events.
Also, reed valves restrict the backflow of exhaust gases into the
intake ports.  The phase shifting and use of intake reed valves
optimize the intake and exhaust event timing at the four major
engine operating conditions: idle, part load, wide open throttle
low speed, and high speed.

characteristics.  The gas burner described in US Patent 5,224,855,
issued to Hajime Toyonaga, Toshio Nishida, Yasuo Takeishi, and
Masao Shiomi on July 6, 1993, uses two sets of flame openings.  The
first set discharges stable, self-combustible, high-concentration
gas; and the second set of flame openings discharges unstable, non-
self-combustible, low-concentration gas.  The two sets of flame
openings are arranged in an alternate pattern.  The stable flame
formations at the first set of flame openings assists stabilization
of flame formations at the second set of flame openings.
Consequently, the gas burner may have a high air excess ratio to
reduce its NOx generation and to prevent incomplete combustion.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with issuing a permit
rule that would identify minimum elements of state permit programs
and govern the implementation of state efforts.  Disagreement among
EPA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Council on
Competitiveness delayed the rule's issuance for 8 months.  This has
hindered implementation of the Title V permit program since some
states have waited for the final rule to be issued before
developing their own programs.  Similarly, certain state
legislatures waited for the final rule before enacting legislation
authorizing agencies to fully implement programs and assess fees to
cover their costs.  Because the final rule was issued after many
state legislatures adjourned in 1992, many state agencies had to
wait until 1993 to obtain legislative authority.  As a result, some
states doubt that they will be able to submit their program plans
to EPA by the November 1993 deadline.

Cost estimates by some states indicate that they will face problems
in funding their permit programs.  Although many state agencies
have adopted the $25 per ton of emissions presumptive fee set by
Congress in Title V because of political and economic pressure to
keep fees low, many state officials do not consider this fee
adequate to fund their programs.  For example, Texas' permit
program costs are expected to increase by nearly 300% when Title V
is fully implemented, from the current level of about $15 million
to about $42 million, or $30 to $35 per ton of emissions.  North
Carolina's Clean Air Act Advisory Council has determined that the
state's cost of meeting Title V will be $12 million, or $36 per ton
of emissions.  Wisconsin has estimated that Title V will increase
its needs from $9 million to $18 million.  Wisconsin officials
believe that the state's permit fees should be set between $35 and
$40 per ton to generate the necessary revenue.

Center for Resource Economics (CRE) Report Criticizes EPA

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is failing to carry
out its mission because of gross under-funding and skewed
priorities, according to a study by the Center for Resource
Economics (CRE), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit environmental
research organization.  EPA needs a budget increase of at least 13%
"to provide even minimally adequate environmental protection," the
report says, but instead is facing an 8% cut in its 1994 budget.
The CRE report found that EPA has a 22% budget shortfall in its
core operating programs and, as a result, is unable to fully
enforce a single environmental protection statute.  EPA spends 80%
of its funds on pollutants ranked as relatively low risks by the
agency, with 20% going to high risk pollutants, charged CRE.
Inactive toxic waste sites and point source discharges to surface
water, two of the low risk categories, receive 54% of EPA
resources, while high risk air pollutants receive only 6%.  Worker
exposure to chemicals, radon, wetlands destruction, and global
climate change - all high risk areas - receive less than 1% each of
EPA's resources.  "More than 2 decades after its creation, EPA
cannot guarantee the safety of pesticides and other toxic
substances widely used in the U.S.," CRE said.  EPA officials say
that their priorities are largely determined by laws passed by
Congress and that the agency's budget is constrained by the federal
budget deficit.

Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Allowances Auction Canceled

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) canceled its scheduled June 1993
auction of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances because the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not implemented a
computer-based allowance tracking system.  CBT successfully ran
EPA's March 1993 auction.  EPA says that the tracking system is
unnecessary for companies to trade the allowances privately.

U.S. Leads in Pollution Control Equipment Exports

The U.S. was the world's leading exporter of pollution control
equipment in 1991 with a trade surplus of $1.1 billion according to
a report released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).  Germany led in 1990, but U.S. companies took the lead in
1991 with $188 million more in exports than Germany.  U.S.
environmental exports increased 70% from 1989 to 1991, while
imports increased 45%.

Inst. of Clean Air Companies says Smog Control Costs Exaggerated

The Institute of Clean Air Companies, Inc. (ICAC, 1707 L Street NW
Suite 750, Washington, DC 20036-4201; Tel 202/457-0911, Fax
202/331-1388), the national association of air pollution control
suppliers, has released cost figures for high efficiency control of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) that are only 20-50% of the costs assumed by
state regulators in determining reasonably available control
technology.  ICAC released the figures in comments on a report,
Evaluation and Costing of NOx Controls for Existing Utility Boilers
in the NESCAUM Region, (Evaluation Report) prepared by Acurex
Environmental Corporation for the Northeast States for Coordinated
Air Use Management (NESCAUM) and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA).  ICAC's cost figures show that much more NOx can be
removed for a given level of investment than air quality regulators
have assumed.  For example, the Evaluation Report pegs capital
costs for retrofitting hot-side selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
technology on a 200 MW pulverized coal boiler at about $150/kW.
ICAC says that current market transactions show that this cost is
$30-70/kW, depending on the difficulty of retrofit.  Costs for oil-
and gas-fired retrofits, as well as for new installations, are even
lower.

States are revising their Clean Air Act implementation plans to
further cut NOx emissions, which contribute significantly to urban
smog and acid rain.  "Clean air policy depends on assumptions about
the cost of air pollution controls.  In the case of NOx, reliance
on inflated cost estimates is leading decision makers to establish
unnecessarily loose standards based on controls that can remove no
more than half of a boiler's NOx emissions, when SCR technology is
available to achieve 80-90% emission removal," stated Jeffrey C.
Smith, ICAC's Executive Director.  "The market  history of SCR
technology exemplifies the path of most air pollution controls
commercialized in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  Competition
pushes costs significantly lower and raises performance and
reliability dramatically," Smith added.  A copy of ICAC's written
comments is available from the organization, which has prepared
comments highlighting what it claims are inaccuracies in the
treatment of selective non-catalytic (SNCR) reduction of NOx in the
Evaluation Report.

Cost Effectiveness of Eliminating CO Vehicle Emissions Studied

The cost effectiveness of identification and repair of vehicles
with excessive carbon monoxide emissions was investigated over the
1991-1992 winter period in Provo, UT.  This pilot program used on-
road remote sensing at two locations to identify repeat gross
polluting vehicles.  The owners of gross polluters observed at one
of the locations were solicited for a free repair program carried
out under the direction of the Utah Valley Community College, Auto-
Diesel Division.  The same two locations were revisited after the
repair program had terminated and the vehicle emissions were
remeasured.  Gary A. Bishop, Donald H. Stedman, James E. Peterson,
Theresa J. Hosick, and Paul L. Guenther (Chemistry Department,
University of Denver, University Park, CO 80208-0179) obtained more
than 17,000 measurements on over 10,000 individual vehicles.  As
observed elsewhere, half of the total carbon monoxide was emitted
by only about 10% of the vehicles.  Solicitation letters were sent
to 114 owners, and 47 vehicles were recruited and repairs
attempted.  Of the 47 vehicles, 28 were remeasured when the site
was revisited at the end of the program.  They had improved their
on-road emissions by more than 50%.  The vehicles which were
identified as gross polluters at the second location, but not
notified of their status, were used as the control group.  Their
emissions were also reduced, but only by 14%.  This pilot program
demonstrated carbon monoxide emissions reduction at a cost
effectiveness of $200 per ton, not including the cost benefits of
gas mileage improvement.  $200 per ton is lower than many current
or proposed mandatory programs.  The owner's repair cost would more
than pay for itself in terms of improved fuel economy.  The program
would also generate the on-road fleet emissions data necessary to
evaluate its effectiveness.  Without such data, a program is forced
to rely on computer modeling with its known limitations.  The
researchers published the results of their work in Air & Waste,
Vol. 43, July 1993, 978-988.

Multi-Layer Coating Reduces VOC's

Du Pont (Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel 302/774-1000) has been assigned
a patent for a low volatile organic compound (VOC) multi-layer
clear coating.  The process described in US Patent 5,227,201,
issued to Lee R. Harper on July 13, 1993, forms multiple coats of
finishes on a substrate by first applying a color basecoat layer of
pigment-containing acrylic polymer latex.  Before the basecoat is
cured, a clear coat acrylic polymer having crosslinkable groups and
a crosslinking agent in a volatile organic solvent is applied.  The
layers are cured simultaneously.

VOC's Thermally Stripped from Soil

Richard and Junior L. Crosby (7819-105 Calibre Crossing, Charlotte,
NC 28227) has  a patent for a process which thermally strips
volatile organic compounds (VOC's) from soil using a recirculating
combustible gas.  The transportable system described in US Patent
5,228,803 was issued on July 20, 1993 and includes a vessel in
which contaminated soil is placed in contact with a hot gas.  The
gas is discharged from the vessel, and ambient air is introduced
into the gas to ensure that it remains combustible.  A blower
circulates the gas to a cyclone separator, where fine soil
particles and ash are removed.  The VOC's in the gas are removed by
combustion in a burner fired with a supplemental fuel.  A portion
of the combusted gas is exhausted to the atmosphere, and the
remainder is recirculated to the vessel where the process is
repeated.

VOC Emissions from Glycol Dehydrators Reduced

The Gas Research Institute (Chicago, IL) has been assigned a patent
for a system to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
from glycol dehydrators.  The system described in US Patent
5,209,762, issued to Philip S. Lowell on May 11, 1993, places a
glycol in contact with a natural gas stream to extract water from
the gas.  The glycol is regenerated by heating it to vaporize the
absorbed water.   The vented steam VOC contaminants flow from the
glycol regenerator to the bottom of a steam stripper column.  The
vapors from the top of the steam stripper column are condensed to
produce a water stream with a relatively high concentration of
VOC's.  The water stream is passed to the top of the steam stripper
and then through the stripper counter-currently to the vented gases
and steam.  The condenser water stream is thereby stripped of most
of its organics content and emerges from the bottom of the stripper
column.

RESOLV  Vapor Recovery Systems Capture VOC's

New chemical vapor recovery systems developed by Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. (7201 Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18195-1501;
215/481-8451, Fax 215/481-5431) are helping the chemical process
industries (CPI) meet volatile organic compound (VOC) emission
regulations mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments (Air Toxics
emissions) while reducing costs through the recovery of valuable
chemicals.  RESOLV  chemical vapor recovery systems can remove 95-
99% of the VOC's by using liquid nitrogen to cool process vent
streams to targeted temperatures, condensing, and capturing the
VOC's in liquid form.  The VOC's are captured before they are mixed
and diluted by other waste streams, thereby significantly reducing
disposal costs.  The recovered chemicals can then be sold or
recycled in the manufacturer's operation.  Additionally, further
cost savings can be achieved, since the required quantity of
nitrogen to operate a RESOLV system is often already available on-
site.

In a typical RESOLV installation, liquid nitrogen and VOC emission
streams pass through an indirect condenser.  In the condenser, the
cold liquid nitrogen condenses the VOC's and captures them in
liquid form, while the liquid nitrogen simultaneously converts to
gaseous nitrogen.  The clean, VOC-free vent stream exits the
recovery system, and the clean, gaseous nitrogen is then used
elsewhere in the chemical manufacturing process such as in inerting
processing or storage vessels.  The purity of the nitrogen remains
intact, since it does not come into direct contact with the VOC's.
As a result, Air Products' RESOLV systems permit chemical
manufacturers to realize both the cryogenic and inerting benefits
of their nitrogen supply without the cost and performance
disadvantages associated with freeze-thaw systems.

Air Products says that RESOLV systems offer several advantages over
alternative technologies for meeting VOC regulations.  Air
Products' systems are flexible and can accommodate changes in VOC
regulations without re-engineering the system.  The amount of VOC's
recovered with a RESOLV system can be adjusted simply by reducing
the  temperature of the indirect condenser.  In addition, capital
costs are less; permitting of flares, incinerators, or catalytic
combustion equipment is avoided; and there are no environmental
problems associated with nitrogen oxide and small amounts of non-
combusted VOC's.  RESOLV systems also eliminate the disposal
problems created by adsorption technology or scrubbers.

Air Products' Dr. Bud Dalton, Commercial Development Manager for
the technology, stressed that "RESOLV systems are more than end-of-
pipe solutions; they can be integrated upstream into manufacturing
processes to achieve additional savings."  Air Products customizes
these systems to cost effectively address each customer's VOC
stream composition and recovery/compliance targets.  In some
instances, the CPI customer may only require supplemental cooling
to meet current emission standards.

RE-THERM VF Units Treat VOC's

Research-Cottrell Reeco, Inc. (Box 1500, Somerville, NJ 08876; Tel
908/685-4000, Fax 908/685-4181) is marketing its RE-THERM VF system
to oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and other airborne
pollutants.  Nicholas Coppola, Senior Vice President - Sales, told
us that the technology offers destruction efficiencies of 96-99%.
During operation of the RE-THERM VF system, contaminated process
air enters the unit through an inlet manifold.  Flow control valves
direct the exhaust into those regenerative chambers that have just
switched to the "inlet" mode.  These chambers contain hot ceramic
stoneware that has absorbed most of the heat energy from a previous
batch of exiting cleaned air.  When the incoming, contaminated
exhaust is drawn through the hot stoneware bed, its temperature
increases.  This causes many pollutants and odor-causing compounds
to auto-ignite even before they reach the main purification
chamber.  Gas or oil burners in the main chamber maintain the
required purification temperature.  If the incoming gas stream
contains enough VOC's, the unit can self-sustain, keeping fuel
costs very low.  The purified air is channeled out through a
stoneware bed that has switched to the "outlet" mode.  There, it
deposits most of its heat energy which is transferred to yet
another batch of incoming, contaminated process exhaust.  In most
applications, warm, clean air is then vented to the atmosphere.
Another option is the return of the warm exhaust to the plant to
heat dryers, ovens, or other equipment.  In some units, waste
solvent can be used as auxiliary fuel, further reducing operating
costs and alleviating the plant's solvent disposal problem.  Single
units with a horizontal flow design can treat up to 500,000
ft3/minute.

Fate of VOC's in Municipal Activated Sludge Plants  Investigated

The fate of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in municipal
activated sludge plants has been investigated at pilot and full
scale.  Wayne J. Parker, Doug J. Thompson, John P. Bell, and Henryk
Melcer found that more than 80% of the mass flow of non-chlorinated
compounds was biodegraded while less than 20% was removed by
stripping.  Conversely, 46% of the mass flow of chlorinated
compounds was biodegraded and 47% was removed by stripping.
Adsorption of VOC's onto waste sludge was not a significant removal
mechanism.  The pilot plant used effectively emulated the liquid-
gas phase partitioning and overall compound removals of a full-
scale plant.  There was little difference in liquid-gas phase
partitioning for coarse and fine pore diffusers in spite of
differing mass transfer characteristics as demonstrated by oxygen-
transfer measurements.  This implies that equilibrium between the
liquid- and gas-phase concentrations was achieved with both
diffuser types.  Stripping of VOC's increased with air flow, but
the extent of stripping increased at a declining rate.  The
researchers summarized their work in a paper published in Water
Environment Research Vol. 65, No. 1.

ICI Paints Reduces VOC's with Water-Based Formulations

In an effort to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
from paint solvents, ICI Paints (Slough, UK) has developed what its
says is the first water-based metallic paint for automotive
refinishing.  About 15% of the 800 million liters/year of paint
sold by ICI goes to the auto refinishing market.  The product is
scheduled for introduction in both Europe and the U.S. later in
1993.  The company estimates that European auto repairs account for
about 117,000 metric tons/year of VOC emissions.  ICI has been
active in the Canadian auto refinishing market for many years and
entered the U.S. arena in September 1992 with its existing organic
solvent-based product line.  The new water-based product, which
adapts a microgel latex paint system used in car manufacturing
since the early 1980's, contains only about 15% organic solvents
instead of the 85% or so contained in conventional metallic paints.
ICI hopes to reduce the organic solvent content below 10% by 1994.
The price of the new paint will be 5-30% higher than the existing
product line, but ICI points out that users will be able to avoid
the installation of VOC emissions control equipment.  The company
is manufacturing the new paint at Stowmarket, UK and is undecided
about U.S. manufacturing plans.

Influence of Landscape Variability on Atmospheric  Dispersion

Using idealized distributions of surface moisture, Roger A. Pielke
and Marek Uliasz (Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State
University, Fort Collins, CO) have shown that with a significant
synoptic prevailing flow over regions of surface variability,
dispersion is generally enhanced over heterogeneous surfaces as
compared to horizontally homogeneous conditions.  The importance of
heterogeneity becomes less as the large-scale wind speed increases
and/or the spatial scale of the heterogeneities become less.  The
work demonstrates that the use of Gaussian regulatory models in
areas of landscape variability is inappropriate.  The researchers
published the results of their work in Air & Waste, Vol. 43, July
1993,989-994.

Atmospheric Sulfur Oxidation Influence by Droplet Size in Clouds
and Fog

Cloud and fog have traditionally been assumed to be composed of a
chemically homogeneous population of droplets.  Model predictions
and experimental investigations by Xin Rao, Aaron Bator, and Jeff
Collett, Jr. (Institute for Environmental Studies, University of
Illinois, 1101 West Peabody Drive, Urbana, IL 61801) indicate that
this assumption may not be correct.  Variations in chemical drop
sizes across the drop size spectrum have been predicted and
observed in a number of environments.  The researchers examined the
influence of such variations on aqueous phase oxidation of S(IV) in
the atmosphere.  Measurements of the composition of various drop
size fractions in clouds and fog often reveal differences in pH.
Measurements of S(IV) and H2O2 concentrations in radiation fogs in
California's central valley revealed a dependence on drop size as
well.  Simultaneous variations of pH, S(IV), and H2O2
concentrations across the drop size spectrum complicate predictions
of net rates of sulfur oxidation.  The researchers believe that it
is unlikely that the average rate of sulfur oxidation across the
drop spectrum will be equal to the rate predicted based on average
cloud or fog drop compositions.  They summarized their work in a
paper, Chemical Variations Across the Cloud Drop Size Spectrum and
Their Influence on Sulfur (IV) Oxidation in the Atmosphere,
delivered at the 206th American Chemical Society (ACS) National
Meeting in Chicago, IL August 22-27, 1993.

Software Models Processes and Tracks Chemical Usage

ModelVision Software, Inc. (13186 Trail Hollow, Houston, TX 77079;
Tel 713/461-0043) has commercialized a process modeling and toxic
chemical tracking system.  The software, Visual Chem Track ,
provides both integrated process simulation and lifetime tracking
for more than 1100  chemicals.  "PC-based simulation and accounting
within individual processes and facility-wide meets the critical
needs of managers," said John Shaffer, ModelVision President, who
added, "Federal, state, regional, and local environmental, health,
and safety regulations mandate precise documentation and reporting.
At the same time, good management practice calls for constant
analysis and revision, both of individual operations and entire
processes.  Since businesses must keep accurate information for
compliance, our software builds on that base by means of a dynamic
model."

Shaffer said that the software is user-friendly and that the on-
line "help" feature allows users to master the software at their
own learning pace.  Each engineer or process manager describes in
detail the facility, production unit, and component operations
including the names and quantities of chemicals involved.  Once the
model is built, the system provides continuous, accurate tracking
of all chemicals, showing where efficiencies can be obtained in
both chemical use and by-product generation.  Using Visual Chem
Track, engineers and process managers describe facility and
individual production units in visual, process flow diagrams; enter
chemical substances involved in each step of facility operation;
track chemical consumption, processing, and by-product generation
at both the production unit and total facility levels; fine tune
operations using a mass balance transfer function to automatically
tabulate and balance chemical inputs and outputs; track more than
1100 compounds by CAS number, usage, or generation threshold,
regulation, and/or type of operation; provide a basis for comparing
operations with plans, assuring that both the total facility and
individual production units and sub-units operate optimally.
Visual Chem Track prepares federal and state environmental forms,
and produces reports tailored to management's specifications to
analyze trends and aid decision making.  The software requires
Microsoft Windows 3.1, an 80386 or higher microprocessor, and at
least 2 megabytes of RAM.  Visual Chem Track is priced at $2000.

German Technology Cuts Toxic Incinerator Residue

GSB mbH (Munich, Germany), a waste disposal company, has pilot
tested a process to cut the amount of toxic residue from 4500
metric tons/year to 3900 metric tons/year at a 70,000 metric
tons/year incinerator in Ebenhausen, Germany.  In the process,
fluegas from the incinerator first passes through an electrostatic
precipitator (ESP) to remove the dust.  Sulfur dioxide is then
removed from the fluegas in a 2-step washing process.  By
dissolving the dust from the ESP in the acidic wash water from the
first step of the fluegas cleaning process, GSB can transfer up to
80% of the dust  collected by the ESP to the wastewater stream,
which is then neutralized with calcium hydroxide or calcium
carbonate.  The undissolved material, including the metal
hydroxides, is filtered and vitrified in 2 stages at 500 C and
1000 C, respectively.  The dissolved salts, mainly calcium
chloride, go to a wastewater treatment plant.

Vitropore Ceramic Candles Clean Hot Flue Gas

Pall Corporation (2200 Northern Boulevard, East Hills, NY 11548;
Tel 516/484-5400 or 800/645-6532, Fax 516/621-3976) Vitropore
ceramic filter candles are intended for hot gas solid separation
processes.  Hot combustion gas is too corrosive and contaminated to
be filtered by any media other than ceramics.  If not adequately
filtered, solid particles and acid gases will cause erosion and
fouling of energy recovery system components.  Vitropore ceramic
candles combine high burst strength and thermal shock resistance
with high permeability, high filtration efficiency, and corrosion
resistance in a rigid silicon carbide medium.  They can remove
and/or recycle catalysts from any catalytic reaction.

The candles are made of finely-ground silicon carbide grains.
During manufacturing, grain size is carefully controlled to achieve
an even pore size distribution throughout the candle's length.
After blending the grains, the candles are isostatically pressed
and machined to specific dimensions.  Porosity and permeability are
uniform throughout the entire length of the candle, which provides
consistent filter performance during blowback operations.  Pall
claims that its Vitropore candles collect more than 99.9% of
influent solids on the surface of the filter medium.  The company
says that this high removal efficiency is due to the candle's top
surface layer which is a thin, du rable, fine-pore membrane
composed of one or more layers of bonded ceramic material.  This
surface membrane is supported by a thicker, coarser substrate which
enables the candles to function as barrier filters.  They are
especially suited to pulse cleaning or blowback operations, since
particle penetration of the filter body is minimized.  The result
is quantitative solids separation, free of migration or unloading
of particulate matter and consistently good effluent quality.  Pore
says that a major advantage of Vitropore candles is their ability
to withstand heat up to 1000 C due to a proprietary binding
material highly tolerant of thermal shock.

Vitropore candles remove contaminants and/or recover product in
halogenated hydrocarbon, petrochemical, catalyst activator, fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC), hazardous materials incineration, and
fluid bed coal gasifier applications.
