MK ADDS ANOTHER PROJECT IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION<p>
</b></center>

BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation today announced that MK has been 
selected as a subcontractor to Parsons Corporation to provide construction 
management for a chemical demilitarization project in Shchuch'ye, Russia.<P>
       Potential prime contract value is $600 million over five years.  
This is the first large-scale chemical weapons destruction project in the 
world to employ a chemical neutralization process.<P>
     MK will provide construction management, construction subcontracting 
and purchasing of construction materials and equipment, and assistance to 
Russian Federation institutes and agencies through oversight and technical 
support.  The project is scheduled to begin immediately under the U.S. 
Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.<P>
     Robert A. Tinstman, MK president and chief executive officer, said, 
"This project is a good opportunity to apply MK's recognized leadership in 
construction of chemical weapons destruction facilities and our 
in-country, hands-on knowledge of Russian customs, local labor, 
subcontractors, materials and equipment."<P>
     This project adds to MK's proven experience in weapons dismantlement 
and chemical weapons destruction in the former Soviet Union.  Currently, 
MK is executing, as a prime contractor for the Defense Special Weapons 
Agency, fast-track design, construction, maintenance services and
operations support for the SS-19 Neutralization Facility in 
Dniepropetrovsk, Ukraine; and, in conjunction with Thiokol, design and 
construction services for Russia's Liquid Propellant Disposition
projects at the Sergiev Posod and Krasnoyarsk sites.<P>
     MK constructed the first chemical weapons destruction plant in the 
continental U.S. at the Tooele Army Depot in Utah. Currently, MK is 
working on more than 50 overseas projects.<p>

Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE--MK), founded in 1912, serves the 
world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance, 
power, process, transportation and heavy construction markets as an 
engineer and constructor.<p>
