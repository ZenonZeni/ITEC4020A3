Seymour and District boasts diverse attractions, providing many
opportunities for enterprise and good country living.  From the
Great Dividing Range to the fertile Goulburn Valley, the district
has a strong rural base and a network of attractive towns that
host a wide variety of services and a number of manufacturing
firms of distinction.

Located on the northern edge of metropolitan Melbourne, Seymour
and District sits astride the two most important
routes from Victoria to expanding markets in NSW and Queensland
- the Hume Freeway and Goulburn Valley Highway.  National and
international markets are easily accessible via the Melbourne
International Airport, only 45-90 minutes away on the Hume Freeway
and the Western Metropolitan Ring Road.  These
roads also provide easy access to the growing northern and western
metropolitan area.
<P>
Mangalore Airport has a 24-hour landing capacity and provides
flight training and aircraft services.  It can provide significant
freight and passenger services (and is currently a back-up for
Melbourne Airport in bad weather).
<P>
Seymour and Broadford have an excellent rail service to Melbourne.
Nine trains daily travel in each direction providing access for
commuters and businesses to Melbourne's central business district
in 50-80 minutes.
<P>
A number of major firms have settled in the district to make the
most of this superb country location within reach of Melbourne
markets.  Nestle, for example, has established a major sweet-making
facility in Broadford, and Teson Trim at Euroa supplies upholstery
to most of the major car manufacturers in Melbourne.
<P>
New businesses will find Seymour and District a quality location
for many activities, particularly:
<UL>
<LI>processing of primary produce such as grapes, vegetables and
timber;
<LI>transport and distribution;
<LI>services for visitors and tourists.
</UL>

<H2>Wine and tourism taking off</H2>

<P>
The magnificent award-winning Mitchelton and Chateau Tahbilk wineries
of the district attract hundreds of thousands of people each year
for a taste of the good life.  A total of twelve wineries are
established in Seymour and District and, with new vineyards being
developed, the area is positioned to become a major Australian
wine region.
<P>
Opportunities for further investment in viticulture and wine-making
are attractive because of the reasonable price of land, the equable
climate, the availability of water for irrigation and the existing
skills of the regional labour force.  New opportunities in servicing
the wine industry are also emerging, including packaging, transport,
design and equipment repair. 
<P>
With its proximity to Melbourne and the major Victorian highways,
and its range of natural and cultural attractions, Seymour
and District is set to develop as a popular tourist destination.
The four mainstays of tourism in the district are:
<UL>
<LI>natural attractions, including the heritage landscapes of
the Goulburn River, Lake Nagambie and the cool forested uplands
of the Great Dividing Range and the Strathbogie Ranges;
<LI>historic and cultural attractions, including the Seymour Railway
Museum, the Army Museum at Puckapunyal, art galleries, and restaurants
serving fresh and beautifully prepared local produce;
<LI>nationally renowned wineries;
<LI>nine million people who travel through the district each year
on the Hume Freeway and the Goulburn Valley Highway.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The traders and councils of the main towns are implementing strategies
to attract a greater share of visitors and visitor spending. 
These strategies, along with adding value to natural and cultural
attractions, are likely to provid new opportunities for tourist
enterprises in visitor services.
<H2>Towns with a future</H2>

<P>
Each of the main towns of the district has established industries
with a strong future.  Seymour, as the regional centre, has a
wide variety of town services including shopping, government offices,
a TAFE college and professional services.  The town's retail sector
is expanding with the development of a third major supermarket.
<P>
Seymour also hosts a strong manufacturing sector, particularly
in materials and timber.  Marbut-Gunnerson, the largest timber
firm in the town, is well established and is developing national
and international markets.  There are opportunities for downstream
timber products manufacturers to make use of the abundant high
quality wood from the forests of the Central Highlands.

<P>
Euroa has a well-developed visitor industry, servicing travellers
using the Hume Freeway.  The town also has excellent retirement services,
with attractive recreational opportunities, a large hospital,
elderly accommodation and nursing care that is comprehensive by
any standards.
<P>
Further opportunities in the town may be developed in the retirement
industry, especially in providing retirement housing, recreation
and specialist nursing care.
<P>
Nagambie, on the Goulburn Valley Highway, sits on the shores of
Lake Nagambie and has become a popular destination for holidaymakers
seeking an inexpensive bush holiday close to home.  The Goulburn
River and the lake provide major recreational opportunities such
as fishing, boating, and water sports.  A new golf course is being
developed and further opportunities are available for tourism,
recreation, residential and retirement development.
<P>
Broadford, in the foothills of the Dividing Range, is the fastest
growing town in the district because of its proximity to Melbourne.
The northern suburbs are only forty minutes away.
As well as a strong commuter role, the town has a large manufacturing
sector, with major firms including APM and Nestle located there.
Other firms produce specialty textiles and timber and undertake
pharmaceutical research.  Broadford provides further opportunities
in servicing the growing population, particularly in retailing
and in other services such as restaurants, motels and professional
services.
<H2>A place to grow</H2>

<P>
Seymour and District offers a great range of lifestyles and places
to live, from the forested hills to the fertile plains, from isolated
bush blocks to the bustle of Seymour.
<P>
There is a wide choice of residential and business locations in
and around the main towns, all of which are less expensive than
in the cities.  They have an excellent infrastructure, such as
plentiful water and natural gas, and social services such as
hospitals, good schools and training facilities and government
services.  If needed, the attractions of Melbourne are only an
hour away.
