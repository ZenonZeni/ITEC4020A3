<P>Ahmad Taufik is president of Indonesia's only independent journalists union and the unofficial leader of the country's free-press movement. He is currently serving a three-year jail sentence for publishing an unlicensed magazine, <CITE>Independen</CITE>, and for expressing &quot;feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government&quot; in several of the magazine's articles.
<P>Held in prison since his arrest in March 1995, Taufik was sentenced on Sept. 1.  His case is emblematic of the Indonesian government's determination to eradicate the country's independent press. As part of that effort, in June 1994 authorities banned three leading newsweeklies known for their editorial independence and daring coverage of domestic politics. The move sparked nationwide demonstrations and international condemnation.
<P>Taufik, who worked for <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.idola.net.id/tempo/"><CITE>TEMPO</CITE></A> --one of the banned magazines--joined several colleagues to form the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) as an alternative to the state-sponsored Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI). Under his leadership, AJI came to play an instrumental role in marshaling public protests against the bans, and it documented the crackdown in a timely and independently produced book. The organization also began publishing the influential <CITE>Independen</CITE>, a limited-circulation magazine that ran investigative stories on government corruption and other subjects that angered President Suharto and Information Minister Harmoko.
<P>Soon after AJI was formed, Harmoko and PWI quickly tightened the screws on the fledgling organization. PWI demanded that editors fire staff members who belonged to AJI or risk losing their publishing licenses. As a result, more than 80 AJI members have lost their jobs, and many others have been transferred to noneditorial positions. After the arrest of Taufik and several colleagues--two of whom, Eko Maryadi and Danang Wardoyo, are also serving jail sentences--the state union expelled 13 of its members for simultaneously belonging to AJI.
<P>Throughout his trial, Taufik reaffirmed his commitment to press freedom. &quot;Journalists should tell the truth and only the truth,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm prepared to be jailed just for the truth.&quot;
<P>In recognition of his courage, CPJ honored Taufik with its annual International Press Freedom Award in December 1995.  CPJ has also initiated a letter-writing campaign to secure Taufik's release and urges readers of this page to join in the appeals.
