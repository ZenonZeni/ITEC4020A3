<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Threats:</STRONG>  <I>Unsustainable harvesting of forests; mining; and lack of in-country capacity for conservation.</I>  

<P>
The nations of Melanesia are unparalleled for the diversity
of their cultures.  Ethnic groups number into the hundreds, and
on the island of New Guinea alone, nearly 900 languages are spoken.
 One critical tradition guiding CI's conservation strategy in
many of these island cultures is a long-standing system of forest
ownership through tradition clans.  CI's strategy aims to cultivate
conservation by reinforcing the strong ties that exist between
the island people and their land.   

<P><H4>Papua New Guinea  </H4>

<P>
The eastern
half of the island of New Guinea, PNG's biodiversity can only
be described in superlatives.  It harbors over 10,000 flowering
plant species, 90 percent of which are endemic, and also boasts
the world's largest dove, grasshopper, and butterfly, and the
longest lizard.  CI is working in the Lakekamu Basin, one of PNG's
last intact expanses of lowland rainforest, with four local indigenous
groups and two NGOs to develop facilities for scientific research
and adventure ecotourism.

On the island of New Britain, a region
threatened by intense forestry development, CI, indigenous landowners,
and the East New Britain Social Action Committee are creating
conservation areas supported by economic alternatives to logging.

<P>
<H4> Makira Island, the Solomon Islands</H4>

<P>
 In partnership with the
Maruia Society, the Solomon Islands Development Trust, and 35
local Makira Island communities, CI's Conservation-in-Development
program has established a conservation area of 63,000 hectares
of forest.  The partners also  operate a community-based enterprise
that exports ngali-nut oil.  Preferring CI's conservation-based
development over forest destruction, Makira Island residents rejected
logging company bids to harvest timber.   

<P>One of CI's greatest
moments in 1995 came when the 35 villages of Makira Island rejected
logging contract offers from a major corporation operating in
the region.  Armed with information on communities' experience
in other parts of the world, the Makira people didn't go for the
quick cash.  Instead, they weighed the prospect of logging versus
alternative enterprises in partnership with CI, the Maruia Society,
and the Solomon Islands Development Trust--and decided in favor
of their culture and their land. Their decision is all the more
impressive since it came before the alternatives, which include
a ngali-nut oil export business and ecotourism -- have produced
long-term economic benefits.    

<P><H4>Fiji</H4>

<P>  In 1995 CI and the Maruia
Society completed a detailed plan for conserving Sovi Basin, Fiji's
last pristine lowland rain forest. New Caledonia.   CI has supported
the review of the protected area network that will contribute
to a major rapid assessment of key forest ecosystems of New Caledonia
in 1996.
