<P>We now know that trace minerals are just as important to our overall health as vitamins. Life Plus has bottled 77 colloidal minerals in a pleasant berry flavored liquid. BERRY'D TREASURE provides the benefits of plant derived colloidal minerals. The value of minerals in the support of good health is becoming more realized by thousands of individuals. Everything on the earth, even the earth itself,
is built on a foundation of minerals. They are a part of the structure of our connective and supportive tissues and are components of our hormones and enzymes, which are responsible for our biochemical life.</P>

<H2>TRACE MINERALS</H2>
<P>Trace minerals are only required in small amounts, sometimes smaller than the
eye can see. But this small quantity should not mean they are any less important.
A deficiency in any of them can be just as serious as any major mineral
deficiency. Nowhere is there a more powerful or effective means of obtaining
them than by taking Life Plus BERRY'D TREASURE.</P>

<P>Each tablespoon contains 600 mg of 77 plant derived colloidal minerals. They
have been concentrated by a proprietary process, using only cool, 
contaminant-free water to maintain high bioavailability and colloidal
nature.</p>


<H2>HEALING THE BODY AND THE LAND</H2>
<P> The people of the rainforest have used plants found deep in the jungle for centuries to enhance vitality and overall health. This ancient wisdom is now available through BERRY'D TREASURE and other unique Life Plus RAINFORCE products. They bring you the benefits of highly effective natural herbal and plant extracts, harvested ecologically to preserve the natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Financial contributions are made supporting improved economics and education of the indigenous people.  Specific formulas are blended with other synergistic natural ingredients using current "state of the art" Life Plus technology, which results in fantastic, reliable results.</P>

<P>The plant derived colloidal minerals are in a base of  the valuable Rainforest herbs, Suma, Uncaria Tomentosa (Cat's Claw) and Chuchuhuasi and natural flavoring from grape skins, cherry and berry extracts plus fructose and other natural herbal flavoring aids. </P>
