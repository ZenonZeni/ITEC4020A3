<H1>How researchers assess<BR>

natural climate variability</H1>
<HR>
<B>Climate impacts studies can help to reduce the human toll of climate 
hazards.</B>  Most studies are designed to satisfy one of four general objectives.  
Studies following a specific storm, drought, or flood offer immediate and practical 
benefits.  They count lives lost; estimate the cost to families, companies, and governments; 
and assess the need for and effectiveness of emergency assistance.  Other impacts studies 
seek to improve forecasting and preparedness in order to avert the worst catastrophes.  
Still others identify regions, people, and economic activities (such as <A HREF = 
"fs122.html">agriculture</A> ) that are particularly sensitive to 
climatic variations and thus in need of development and other assistance.  Studies in the 
final category identify the potential impacts of climate variability under future conditions 
of global change, including higher population densities, desertification, and climate 
change.  The specific objective agreed by the research team strongly influences the study's 
focus, structure, and methodology.<P>
<B>Impacts studies focus on how specific climatic conditions affect specific people 
or resources.  </B>For studies of severe storms and other types of climate episodes, 
researchers must make accurate measurements of location, intensity, and duration.  Time 
series and risk analyses are used to estimate the probability of such anomalies (departures 
from average conditions) as well as trends in frequency and severity.  With this climatic 
information in hand, the researchers then analyse the impact on a resource (for example, 
timber losses due to wildfire), population (perhaps counted as lives lost or 
population-at-risk), or organisational level (individuals, households, firms, nations, or 
administrative units).  The world-wide economic costs of climatic hazards - including 
droughts, winds, cyclones, floods, and lightning - rose dramatically in the 1980s and 
1990s, exceeding US$50 billion in 1992 alone.  But measuring costs, as well as the 
relative benefit of efforts to reduce vulnerability to impacts, is difficult.  Many of the costs 
are dispersed, borne by individuals, or not readily valued in financial terms.  While most 
warning systems are clearly cost-effective, costly engineering schemes, such as large 
reservoirs to increase the food supply through irrigation, are sometimes not.<P>
<B>The most effective impacts studies are cooperative efforts among researchers, 
policy-makers, and the public.</B>  Because climate impacts are so multi-dimensional, 
involving the climate system, geo-physical processes, economic activities, and human 
impacts and responses, impacts studies require the collaboration of experts from many 
research disciplines.  The involvement of policy-makers ensures that the research has 
useful and practical applications for solving real problems. The participation of a broad 
spectrum of the public, including companies and communities directly affected by the 
hazard, also improves the project's relevance.<P>
<B>Researchers use a variety of scientific methods to assess sensitivities to climatic 
fluctuations.</B>  They can review and synthesise the existing research describing 
climate events and impacts and interview local people, whose knowledge and perceptions 
of climate hazards can be more detailed and profound than the most sophisticated models.  
They can conduct individual case studies and field surveys of a specific episode, or a series 
of studies permitting rigorous comparisons of many different episodes or regions.  Finally, 
they can use quantitative modelling based on simulation, empirical-statistical, or spatial 
models.  Modelling typically requires a great deal of time and effort for collecting the 
necessary data and validating the results.  The most thorough studies use all of these 
methods together to create as complete a picture as possible.<P>
<B>In addition to studying the actual impacts, researchers must consider what 
would have happened without the unusual climatic conditions.</B>  In other words, 
they must project the baseline conditions in the absence of the climate anomaly.  For 
example, cereal prices must be seasonally adjusted in a drought impacts study to reflect 
that prices tend to be lowest just after the harvest.  Mortality figures for a famine can be 
based on the number of people <I>not born</I> - that is, the difference between fertility 
rates during average years and during the crisis, rather than an actual count of the people 
who died as a direct result of the crisis.  The trend in an underlying baseline may be 
significant, and not necessarily related to climate.  For example, although the baseline 
trend for cereal yields in the US has been a steady increase over the past 100 years due to 
improved methods and technologies, the yearly variability about the trend-line is still 
significantly related to climatic variations.<P>
<B>While some studies are strictly descriptive, many others are proscriptive, 
focusing explicitly on what people could do to reduce the negative impacts of 
climate.</B>  Their aim is to improve preparedness and warning systems in advance of a 
climate event and resiliency afterwards.  The range of effective responses can be tested 
through a series of "what if" scenarios.  For example, would earlier warnings of drought in 
Africa lead to more effective responses?  Individual climate episodes naturally provoke 
immediate response measures:  might the cumulative effect of such responses lessen 
vulnerability to some hazards while increasing the potential for catastrophe? Controlling 
floods, perhaps with channels and embankments, may eliminate damage from most floods, 
but increase the potential for a rare flood of catastrophic proportions.  This could occur if 
people believe that the risk has been controlled and so proceed to settle in greater numbers 
in the flood plain.<P>
<B>Studies of climate variability can offer insights into climate change 
impacts.</B>  Climate change may alter <A HREF = 
"fs017.html">the patterns of climate variability</A> and <A 
HREF = "fs105.html">the frequency of extreme</A> events in 
particular areas.  At the same time, other forces of global change - population and 
economic growth, consumption patterns, policy-making, environmental deterioration - 
may displace  vulnerable populations and undermine their ability to cope with extreme 
events.  By studying the impacts of natural climate variability and the range of response 
options, researchers can also shed light on possible climate change impacts and adaptation 
strategies.<P>
