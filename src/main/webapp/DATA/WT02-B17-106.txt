In this work, we are developing a lightweight hydride storage system 
that integrates hydride bed and vehicle operating characteristics.  
Initially, researchers 
at SNL are designing, building, and demonstrating a hydrogen storage 
system that uses a 
lightweight hydride, and then integrating this system with 
high-efficiency engines.  Previous 
engineering demonstrations of hydride storage for vehicles used hydride 
materials that required low temperatures but were very heavy.  Because 
the additional weight affects the range and performance of the vehicles, 
it is a major obstacle to the use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel.  
We are investigating improvements in hydride properties that will make it 
feasible to use lightweight hydrides in vehicles.

A paper was presented at the 7th Annual National Hydrogen Association

meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, on the &quot;Design and Development

of Hydrogen Storage and Delivery Systems.&quot;  Analytical modeling

activities in the areas of lightweight hydride utilization for

high-efficiency lean-burn internal combustion engines and 
low-temperature

hydride utilization for fuel-cell powered vehicles were the primary

areas discussed.

An analytical model of the Palm Desert demonstration vehicle hydrogen

hydride/fuel cell storage and delivery system is being developed.

 The model is based on the linking of energy and mass balance

modules of individual system components.  These modules will allow

performance characteristics of the vehicles to be evaluated under

a variety of operating conditions.  To date, modules have been

developed for the hydride bed, recirculation tank, circulation

pump, heat exchangers, air blower, battery, parasitic loads, and

power logic controller.  Work currently focuses on development

of a fuel cell module.  On completion of this work, the individual

modules will be linked together, allowing calibration of the model.

 Schatz Energy Research Center (SERC) provided Sandia with fuel

cell heat generation data from both dynamometer and road test

simulations.  This information will be used for initial model

calibration.  After that, Sandia will collaborate with SERC to

determine which additional test data and model refinements are

needed to complete the model calibration.

Construction of the hydrogen gas handling system for the Hydride

Bed Experimental Test and Evaluation Facility was completed. 

The first version of acquisition software for the system, based

on LabView&#174;, was also completed.  The design of the system

was determined primarily by the requirements of providing a simulation

facility for testing metal hydride beds for use in the Palm Desert

Vehicle Program.  Leak checking of all system components is under

way, and initial testing of the entire system (gas handling +

acquisition) has started.  Bed testing, using a 200-L capacity,

commercially available bed, will begin when leak checking is

finished.
