<B><I>Impact on Children with Exceptionalities</B></I><U><BR>
</U><BR>
While all of these bills, if enacted, will ultimately affect children with exceptionalities and their families, some provisions could have immediate repercussions on education programs for children.  Unfortunately, only the "American Dream Savings Account" proposal in the <B>American Dream Restoration Act</B> would directly encourage investment in education.  Even then, the only benefit to such a savings account would be that a family would pay income taxes on the amount deposited but not on the amount withdrawn.   The funds could be used for education expenses at a postsecondary institution (college or training institution) for self, spouse or dependent child.<P>
Alarmingly, the contract does include several budgetary proposals that could have a detrimental effect on education programs for children with exceptionalities.  For example, the balanced budget amendment would cause severe cuts in federal spending.  Given that the contract also includes proposals to increase funding for law enforcement and prison construction by $20.5 billion and will cut taxes, the question the education community needs to ask is, "Where are the funding cuts going to come from to balance the budget, and how is the country going to pay for the new initiatives?"  <P>
The Contract also proposes reestablishing the "firewalls" around the defense budget.  This provision would prevent any redistribution of funds from defense needs to domestic needs.  This would make it even harder to gain funding increases in the education arena.  <P>
Finally, in the <B>Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>, there are a series of regulatory "reforms" that could affect laws for individuals with disabilities.  CEC will continue to monitor these legislative initiatives and keep you informed.
