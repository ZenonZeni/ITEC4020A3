RESEARCHERS CALL FOR CEQA REFORM

  The California Environmental Quality Act should permit wide-
ranging discussion of environmental issues at the planning
stage but provide tightly focused analysis at the project level,
according to a new report from a team of researchers at the
University of California, Berkeley.
  "Fixing CEQA," a report published by the California Policy
Seminar, is the latest in a long series of documents suggesting
how CEQA might be reformed. It comes on the heels of a recent
policy report by the Little Hoover Commission, which also
proposed some changes to CEQA. But the Berkeley report also
contains a great deal of data on how CEQA is used by planning
practitioners in California.
  Underlying both reports is the ongoing question of what the
relationship should be between CEQA and the planning process.
Comparing CEQA to the National Environmental Policy Act and
17 other "mini-NEPAs" around the country, the research team
concluded that CEQA is much more widely used at the project
level than its counterparts P a fact that often makes it the
"driver" on many planning issues. Only the mini-NEPAs in
Washington and New York are used in so wide a range of
situations, but development activity in those states is a fraction
of what it is in California.
  Like the Little Hoover Commission report, the Berkeley team
recommends greater involvement of state and regional
agencies in the CEQA process and incentives to provide greater
certainty all along the line. "The fundamental problem with
CEQA," the researchers report, "is that it fails to encourage
fairness and consistency in the review process or in the
required impact mitigations." This problem is reflected in what
Berkeley planning professor John Landis, the lead researcher,
calls "the 90%/10% problem." "For 90% of the projects which
are not controversial, CEQA works fine," he said. "For the other
10%, it falls apart."
  Unlike the Little Hoover Commission report, however, the
Berkeley report does not recommend that CEQA be used as the
primary tool for environmental decision-making on a regional
and state basis. (For more information on the Little Hoover
Commission report, see CP&DR, December 1995.) "They want to
regionalize CEQA," Landis said. "I'm not sure that's the right
thing to do." Landis acknowledges that four regional issues
continually pop up in CEQA analyses: air quality, water, wildlife
habitat, and traffic. Instead of using CEQA as a regional tool to
solve these problems at the project level, the Berkeley team
recommends using CEQA in a different way at the plan level
and the project level. The Berkeley researchers also
recommended a series of improvements to cumulative impact
monitoring to handle regional issues.
  "At the planning stage," concluded the research team, "CEQA
should encourage a broad and open-ended discussion of
alternatives and environmental impacts. This discussion should
be integrated with ongoing local, regional, and state planning
processes. Environmental review of specific projects, by
contrast, should focus on the impacts of that project in relation
to all underlying adopted plans, still attempting to establish
feasible mitigation measures for all significant adverse
impacts."
  The Berkeley team's five specific recommendations are:
  1. Improving the involvement of state and regional agencies
in the CEQA process. This is similar to the Little Hoover
Commission's recommendations and it draws from the research
team's observation that state and regional agencies are
unpredictable players in the CEQA process.
  2. Increasing the certainty and consistency of local CEQA
review. Like the Little Hoover Commission, the Berkeley
researchers noted that a lack of consistent thresholds and other
standards makes it difficult for applicants to know how the
process is going to move forward. Among other things, the
Berkeley researchers propose that localities be forced to adopt
standardized thresholds and standardized mitigation measures
to be used in mitigated negative declarations.
  3. Improving mitigation and monitoring of cumulative
impacts. To overcome CEQA's chronic project-oriented
approach, the research team recommended such steps as an
expanded use of tiered environmental impact reports,
standardized mitigation measures to deal with regional
cumulative impacts, and greater use of pro-active regional
planning and conservation efforts.
  4. Making alternatives analysis better or else eliminating it.
The researchers characterized current alternatives analysis as
little more than a "scaling exercise" that shows how
environmental impacts can be reduced if the scale of the
project is reduced. The researchers proposed expanded
alternatives analysis at the plan level and a more fine-grained
alternatives analysis at the project level. But if these cannot be
achieved, the researchers concluded, the alternatives analysis
is not worth keeping.
  5. Creating more consistency and predictability in CEQA
litigation. The research team concluded that CEQA currently
contains few incentives to mediate disputes and/or avoid
litigation. The team recommended that the Governor's Office of
Planning and Research create a series of guidebooks to
establish "best CEQA practices" in areas where judicial direction
has not been clear or consistent.
  "Fixing CEQA" is available by contacting the California Policy
Seminar at (510) 642-5514.

  What distinguishes the Berkeley study from previous CEQA
analyses is the huge amount of data collected by the
researchers. Among other things, the researchers surveyed
local governments in California and quantified their use of
CEQA; did an in-depth comparison between CEQA and the other
"mini-NEPAs" around the country; and a case study analysis of
CEQA use in 14 local jurisdictions ranging from Calaveras
County to Rancho Cucamonga. (Some of the survey data,
analyzed by University of Illinois planning professor Robert
Olshansky, was discussed in the October 1994 issue of CP&DR.)
  Here are some of the research team's most interesting
findings:

  CEQA Is More Widely Used Than Comparable Laws Elsewhere.
  The researchers compared the use of CEQA in California to the
so-called "Mini-NEPAs" in other states. Mini-NEPAs exist in 15
other states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Yet
CEQA is more widely used in California than in any other state P
and, in fact, it's more widely used than NEPA, the National
Environmental Policy Act.
  Whereas California undertook some 1,300 environmental
impact reports in 1990, the equivalent figure (in 1992) was
only 364 in New York, 126 in Washington, and 69 in
Massachusetts. Connecticut undertook no environmental impact
reports/statements in 1992. Even the federal government,
operating under NEPA, initiated only 456 EIS's in 1992.
Similarly, while California processed more than 25,000
negative declarations in 1990, the equivalent figure (for 1992)
was 1,800 in New York, 7,500 in Washington, and only 12 in
Connecticut.
  Part of the reason for the difference is that the breadth of
CEQA's application is greater. But part of it is simply that
California's construction activity is so much greater than any
other state. When adjusted for the amount of construction
activity, the researchers found that only Washington and New
York have approximately the same amount of CEQA-type
activity. Hawaii and Minnesota lag far behind, while all other
states are barely even on the radar screen.

  EIRs and EIR Litigation Is Rare In Statistical Terms
  The researchers found that, statewide, well over 90% of all
CEQA actions result in negative declarations. Only about 6% of
CEQA cactions lead to EIRs in cities and 3.5% in counties. And
only one in every 354 CEQA reviews (less than 1/3 of 1%)
results in a lawsuit. But because CEQA is so widely applied, the
raw numbers are high even though the percentages are low.
The Berkeley numbers indicate that somewhere around 1,300
EIRs were being undertaken in 1990, while more than 400
CEQA lawsuits were filed in the five-year period between 1986
and 1990.
  The case studies revealed large variations in these numbers,
however. In Santa Barbara County, for example, 21% of all
CEQA reviews led to an EIR P a figure almost three times higher
than any other case study jurisdiction.
  The researchers also discovered that EIRs are far more
commonly used on residential projects than on commercial or
industrial projects. On a per-capita basis, more than twice as
many EIRs are initiated for residential as opposed to
commercial projects, and this finding holds true for both cities
and counties.

  Thresholds Are More Common for Counties Than Cities.
  The Berkeley researchers found that 80% of counties used
standardized thresholds in CEQA review compared to only 12%
of cities.

  Mitigated Negative Declarations Are Commonly Used
  The researchers found that mitigated negative declarations
are used more than half the time in CEQA reviews, though they
noted this includes a wide variety of different situations. This
figure was considerably higher for counties (66%) than for
cities (48%). More than 70% of all jurisdictions reported that
they have a mitigation monitoring program in place.

ADELANTO PAYS PRICE FOR BASE, WATER FIGHTS

By Morris Newman
   The City of Adelanto in San Bernardino County finds itself
isolated and on the brink of municipal bankruptcy, partly as a
result of longstanding fights with its Victor Valley neighbors
over control of a closed military base and the regional water
supply.
  The city is running a $4 million deficit and, until recently,
appeared in danger of defaulting on its bond payments.
Adelanto is also facing a $5 million settlement on a lawsuit
with San Bernardino County, and must borrow money from the
county to make its debt payments on redevelopment bonds.
The financial problems have also forced Adelanto to abide by a
regionwide water allocation that the city initially resisted.
  The story of this High Desert city is a worst-case example of
what happens when one city decides to resist regional
cooperation. It is also an extreme example of the trend in
California for jurisdictions to conduct business with each other
through the courts, and the consequences of doing so. While
most of the blame seems to lie squarely with the city's elected
leadership, recent news reports suggest that San Bernardino
County, the City of Victorville, and the Mojave Water District
each played a role in chastening the maverick city.
   Currently, Adelanto is desperately trying to avoid defaulting
on its bonds. In October, the city's bond underwriter, Tony
Wetherbee, disclosed at a council hearing that the city was
running a $4 million deficit after having spent more than $9
million in lawsuits against
neighboring jurisdictions. As of December, the redevelopment
agency was $760,000 short of a $2.4 million payment on a
bond issue of $46 million.
  Wetherbee is refinancing the redevelopment agency's bonds
by structuring a new issue of $55 million that would allow the
city to make its bond payments while allowing enough extra to
pay off the hefty settlement to San Bernardino County.
  Adelanto's path to near-ruin began in 1989, when the federal
Base Realignment and Closure Commission listed George Air
Force Base on its closure list. Adelanto, which borders the base,
wanted to annex the entire base and rejected the option of
joining the local reuse authority, the Victor Valley Economic
Development Authority (VVEDA), which includes San
Bernardino County and the neighboring cities of Victorville,
Hesperia, and Apple Valley.
  At one point, Adelanto offered the Air Force $25 million to
buy the base outright. The Air Force, however, recognized
VVEDA as the local reuse authority, and Victorville eventually
annexed the former base in 1994.
   Refusing to take the decision lying down, Adelanto fought
back with a host of lawsuits challenging the environmental
impact report for the reuse of George. At the height of the court
battle, there were a total of 34 lawsuits that cost the parties at
least $11 million in legal fees, according to the Base Reuse
Report, a Sacramento-based newsletter. Adelanto's
litigiousness, however, ultimately backfired by dragging the
city through a series of costly legal defeats. In 1994, a
Riverside Superior Court judge ruled that Adelanto could not
use redevelopment money in its effort to acquire George. And
in a court-ordered settlement conference in January, 1995,
Adelanto finally stood down and relinquished its claim on
George.
   At the same time, however, Adelanto got into another dispute
with its neighbors over the water rights at George. When
George was an operational military base, the state created a
special arrangement for the city and the base to share a
common allocation of water. However, last fall, at the
instigation of the Mojave Water Agency, a Riverside County
judge issued a comprehensive settlement of all water rights
claims in the area. Under the agreement, all water users were
required to reduce their water use and the Mojave Water
Agency, which sells water to 250,000 residents in the High
Desert, was named special master. (CP&DR, November 1995.)
  Adelanto did not agree to the settlement, continuing to claim
it had a "prior and paramount" right to the waters of the
Mojave River. At this point, however, the Mojave Water Agency
shrewdly used Adelanto's financial troubles on the
redevelopment front as a lever to get the city to buy into the
water agreement.
  Adelanto's redevelopment troubles began in 1993, when the
San Bernardino County Grand Jury audited the city's attempt to
acquire George. The Grand Jury found that the city was
borrowing money from its well-funded redevelopment agency
(most of Adelanto is carpeted in redevelopment project areas)
while the redevelopment agency attempted to keep itself afloat
by issuing new bonds with interest rates higher than the city
could afford. In its report, the Grand Jury found that the
redevelopment agency had "exhausted all available resources
for operations," while lacking "any financial plan detailing its
projected expenditures, bond proceeds and other revenues
over the next several years."
  Based on the Grand Jury's findings, San Bernardino County
sued Adelanto in November 1993. The suit alleged that the city
had spent more than $4.2 million to acquire George, and had
illegally dipped into redevelopment funds for city operations.
The suit requested a group of city officials, including then-
Mayor Mary Scarpa, five city councilmembers and City
Manager Patricia Chamberlayne to pay the redevelopment
agency $6.34 million for the tax increment used to pursue
George and other non-redevelopment purposes. The settlement,
signed in October, required Adelanto to pay the county $5
million by the end of 1995, while allowing the Adelanto
Redevelopment Agency to borrow $100,000 of the county's
"fair-share" cut of the city's tax increment revenues to make its
bond payments. The settlement also authorizes Adelanto to
float the $55 million bond issue, which would enable the city to
restructure its existing bond portfolio and raise the additional
$5 million to pay off the county.
  Adelanto city officials were angered, however, when news
reports revealed that the City of Victorville had quietly lent the
county $800,000 to fund the lawsuit against Adelanto.
Victorville's role was surprising, because it appeared to violate
a January 1995 settlement agreement between the two cities
not to engage in further litigation. But Mike Rothschild,
Victorville Mayor Pro Tem, said in an interview Adelanto had
broken the peace by prosecuting the water issue, which he said
was part of the "total settlement package."
   The final humiliation for Adelanto, however, came in
November, at the hands of the water agency. The city clearly
needed to move ahead as quickly as possible on the new bond
issue. But the city could not move forward without the
approval of the Mojave Water Agency. The water purveyor,
however, threatened to sue Adelanto over a crucial part of the
recovery plan P the merger of two redevelopment areas in the
city P unless the city agreed to the regional water-sharing plan.
Advisers to the city pleaded with the mayor and
councilmembers to give into the water agency, and avoid
catastrophe.
  "Adelanto is insolvent," bond underwriter Tony Wetherbee
told the council. Said City Attorney Robert Corrado at the same
meeting: "Municipal bankruptcy is an ugly, ugly thing. We're
going to be in litigation forever." Later, when the council
appeared adamant against the water deal, he pleaded, "This is a
mistake of cosmic proportions and it means the end of
Adelanto as we know it."
  Notwithstanding those pleas, Mayor Judy Crommie and two
other council members voted against accepting the water plan.
Almost immediately after the meeting, according to local news
accounts, Crommie changed her mind, and scheduled an
emergency meeting for the following Thursday, when she
switched her vote.
   Adelanto had attempted to complete the restructuring of its
redevelopment bonds by December 31, 1995, which was the
deadline for the $5 million payment to San Bernardino County.
Because Standard & Poor rated the issue (BBB-) P an important
precondition of the bond sale P only in the closing days of the
year, the county granted the city an additional 10 days to the
city to make its payment; the new bond issue was scheduled to
close on January 9, according to the Victor Valley Daily Press.
Michael Sakamoto, acting city manager and the only Adelanto
official who would agree to be interviewed for this story, was
reluctant to comment on whether he thought the city had done
wisely in spending so much of its treasury fighting for George
and the Mojave River. "I don't want to comment on the
appropriateness or inappropriateness of any city action. The
City Council has instructed me to look for, and try to fashion, a
plan for the city to go forward," he said.

SACRAMENTO FINALLY GETS OUT OF HYATT HOTEL DEAL

  The City of Sacramento has finally cut all ties to the Hyatt
Regency Hotel, a 15-story luxury hotel across the street from
the State Capitol that the Sacramento Housing and
Redevelopment Agency helped subsidize. The deal releases the
redevelopment agency from its obligations without laying out
any cash.
  In December, the city agreed to surrender title to the land
under the hotel and the adjacent parking garage (of which the
redevelopment agency owned 48%) to Mutual Life Insurance
Co. of New York, the hotel's current owner. In exchange, the
redevelopment agency has been released from its obligation to
provide a $1.5 million annual subsidy to the hotel's owners for
the next 68 years.
  The Hyatt opened in 1988 as part of a public-private
partnership between the redevelopment agency and several
prominent private developers in Sacramento including Joe
Benvenuti and Gregg Lukenbill. It was designed as a
centerpiece project for downtown Sacramento. The Hyatt is the
most luxurious hotel in downtown Sacramento by far, and its
meeting room facilities are located close to the downtown
convention center. The city invested $13 million in the project
and agreed to the annual subsidy for 75 years, retaining
ownership in the land and part ownership in the parking
garage.
  But Benvenuti and Lukenbill ran into financial trouble when
the real estate market went sour in the early '90s, and MONY P
the primary lender on the project P assumed ownership in
1992. Ever since, MONY and the city have sought to reach an
agreement that would take the city out of the project
altogether.
  In 1991, on the eve of MONY's foreclosure, the city offered
$11 million in order to be released from its obligations but
MONY rejected the offer. Earlier this year, one consultant
suggested that the city offer MONY $7.7 million and the hotel
land. But Mayor Joe Serna and some other members of the City
Council were reluctant to agree to a deal that called for the
redevelopment agency to turn cash over to MONY.
  Under the deal as agreed, the redevelopment agency will not
be required to provide any cash to MONY. In fact, MONY will
actually pay the redevelopment agency $196,000 for a small
parcel of land at the southwest corner of the hotel. And if
MONY seeks to sell the property, the city could profit. Under
the deal, the city will receive 25% of any sales price over $62
million. MONY officials said they have not decided whether to
sell the hotel.

ACCORD REACHED ON VERMONT AVENUE
  Los Angeles's leading politicians have reached an agreement
with First Interstate Bank to reduce the city subsidy on the
controversial mixed-use project proposed for the corner of
Vermont Avenue and 81st Street.
  A city loan to buy the property was approved by the City
Council in November but vetoed by Mayor Richard Riordan.
(CP&DR, December 1995.) Subsequently, however, the council
passed a unanimous override of Riordan's veto. In the ensuing
weeks, Riordan, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, and First
Interstate agreed to a new financial agreement which calls for
the bank to put more money into the project so the city's
subsidy will drop from $90,000 per housing unit to $70,000
per housing unit.
  Riordan opposed the project for two reasons: opposition from
a nearby homeowners association and the high subsidy per
unit. Riordan became interested in the project after
neighboring homeowners P U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters among
them P said they are opposed to any housing development
along the commercially zoned Vermont Avenue corridor. He
also questioned the $90,000 subsidy, which is close to double
the typical subsidy in a city-assisted housing project.
  Under the agreement with Riordan, the project still retains 35

moderate-income townhomes. Yet Riordan claimed victory for
the neighborhood, saying that he, unlike other politicians, had
listened to a group of residents who have traditionally been
disenfranchised.
  The Vermont proposal arose from a design/build competition
for affordable housing sponsored by First Interstate after the
1992 riots. The project is to be built on a mostly vacant 1.7-
acre site that served as the original location of Pepperdine
University. As currently designed, the project will include 35
townhomes (selling for between $88,000 and $130,000 each),
six small retail storefronts, and a satellite office of the USC
Business Expansion Network, to be located in an historic art-
deco building on the site. The project was strongly embraced
by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area.

MALIBU PASSES GENERAL PLAN
  Facing a deadline from the Governor's Office of Planning &
Research, the City of Malibu has finally approved a general
plan that many council members claim is not restrictive enough
even though outside critics call it too restrictive.
  Approval of the general plan came more than four years after
the city's incorporation. The city has been engaged in a highly
political dispute with OPR last year over a time extension for
approving the plan. OPR denied a time extension after claiming
the plan does not provide affordable housing choices. Property
owners are likely to challenge the city's general plan in court
on housing element grounds.
  The plan calls for one-acre lots (or lower density) on 95% of
the undeveloped residential property in the city. A few
residential properties will be permitted to build four to six
units per acre. The plan also prohibits construction in areas
previously designated by Los Angeles County as
"environmental sensitive habitat areas" (about 9% of the city
altogether) and discourages development of sidewalks, street
lights, and other typical suburban infrastructure.
  The plan calls for permitting the construction of one hotel
near Pepperdine University, which city officials hope will
produce enough revenue to keep the city solvent.
  Property owners and state officials were not the plan's only
critics. Officials in nearby Santa Monica also complained about
the plan, which says Malibu's homeless will probably have to
find shelter in Santa Monica. Mayor Paul Rosenstein told the
Los angeles Times: "There have been rumors for yers that other
cities have been sending their homeless people to Santa
Monica. This is the first time I have seen a city admit it."

FISH & GAME FEE TO BE REINSTATED

  After a new legal challenge, a Sacramento judge has ordered
the state Department of Fish & Game to resume collection of the
Fish & Game environmental review fee. But the state has not
yet begun collection of the fee and the judge has not yet
decided whether to make collection retroactive.
  However, Fish & Game may seek a legislative solution by
asking the legislature to repeal the law that instituted the fee
in the first place. Fish & Game General Counsel Craig Manson
said the agency has spoken to some legislators and legislative
staff members but no bill has been introduced yet.
  The latest set of developments are the most bizarre yet in the
controversial history of the fee. On the one hand, Sacramento
Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Gunther has ordered Fish & Game
to start collecting the fee once again even though he had
previously ruled the fee unconstitutional. And on the other
hand, Fish & Game has taken an official position against the fee,
even though the agency benefits financially from it.
  Last summer, Fish & Game agreed to stop collecting the fee as
part of a legal settlement with several plaintiffs who
challenged the fee as an illegal tax. (CP&DR Environmental
Watch, July 1995.) The legal settlement came after Gunther had
initially ruled against the fee. But the settlement was
subsequently challenged by the California Association of
Professional Scientists (CAPS), the union that represents most
of the biologists who work for Fish & Game.
  CAPS argued that a state department cannot stop enforcing a
state law unless ordered to do so by an appellate court.
Gunther agreed and ordered the state to begin collecting the
fee again. However, in early January, the Fish & Game
Department had not yet begun to collect the fee because
Gunther had not issued a final written ruling.
  The Fish & Game fees were instituted by a bill that passed the
legislature in 1990. Local development applicants subject to the
California Environmental Quality Act must pay $850 for Fish &
Game to review environmental impact reports and $1,250 for
the department to review negative declarations.
  As Fish & Game's revenue from hunting and fishing licenses
has declined, the fees have provided a new source of revenue,
bringing the agency approximately $3 million per year, or
about 2% of its total budget. The fees have always been
controversial because no other state agency has statutory
authority to collect such fees and because local governments
were required to collect the fees for Fish & Game.
  The fee was originally challenged in 1991 by Redding
property owner Albert Mills. Mills claimed that the fee was not
a fee for service and therefore constituted a tax. He further
argued that as a tax, the fee was invalid because it did not pass
the Legislature by a two-thirds vote. Mills later formed
Californians for Fair Government Fees, representing 112 other
applicants who had paid the fees. Mills's lawyer, Walter McNeill
of Redding, filed a separate suit because of a Fish & Game fee
he had paid personally.
  Last March, Gunther ruled in favor of Mills, saying that the
fees were really taxes because the state had never determined
the actual cost of reviewing environmental documents before
passing the law. Pessimistic about the chances of success on
appeal, the agency agreed to a settlement which called for
refunds to Mills, McNeill, and members of Mills's group, as well
as a ban on further collection of the fees.
  Craig Manson, Fish & Game's general counsel, said that
collection of the fees would not begin until Gunther issued his
written ruling. He also said Gunther's ruling would address the
question of whether Fish & Game should collect fees
retroactively from applicants who had not paid the fees
because of the legal settlement.

ORANGE COUNTY NCCP RELEASED
   A wildlife habitat plan calling for preservation of 39,000
acres of undeveloped property has been released in draft form
by Orange County.  About half the preserve will consist of
coastal sage scrub, the habitat of the controversial California
gnatcatcher. The Orange County Planning Commission is now in
the process of reviewing the plan and the Board of Supervisors
is expected to act on the plan in March.
  The plan is part of the "Natural Communities Conservation
Planning" program undertaken by local, state, and federal
agencies in 1991 when the gnatcatcher was first proposed for
listing under state and federal endangered species laws.
  Called the Central/Coast NCCP/HCP (habitat conservation
plan), the plan calls for preservation of almost 20% of all
property in a 325-square-mile portion of Orange County that
stretches from Cleveland National Forest south and west to the
Pacific Ocean near San Juan Capistrano. Much of the land to be
preserved is owned by The Irvine Co. The plan is designed to
protect a total of 42 species, most of which are not currently
listed under the state or federal endangered species laws. Part
of the plan's purpose is to provide property owners with
assurance that they will have met their legal obligations if any
additional species are listed in the future.
  The Central/Coast plan is the first of three "sub-regional"
plans dealing with different areas of Orange County. An NCCP
plan for south Orange County is expected to be released later
this year, and a third NCCP for north Orange County is also in
the works. Three NCCP plans are also under way in San Diego
County.

PACKARD BELL DEAL LOOKS GOOD--BUT COMES AT A PRICE

  One year after the conversion of the Sacramento Army Depot
into a regional headquarters for Packard Bell, the deal is
shaping up as one of the most successful conversions of a
military base in California. Part of that success can be credited
to extraordinarily high subsidies provided by the City of
Sacramento. Also sharing the credit is a base-conversion
method known as an "economic development conveyance,"
which allowed local authorities to acquire the base at no cost in
return for sharing the profits of base reuse with the military.
  To date, the conversion of the Army Depot has far surpassed
initial expectations of both job creation and tax revenues.
Packard Bell had projected employment for 1,000 jobs at the
end of its first year; the company currently employs 5,000
people at the former depot, which is now an assembly plant for
personal computers. In addition, the new plant has spurred the
creation of an additional 2,500 to 3,000 jobs in the community
at large. The payroll, initially projected at $60 million to $80
million, is currently about $200 million. The plant also
generates about $1 million annually in local taxes. City officials
claim that enterprise zone tax credits have encouraged a
greater level of hiring and have taken several hundred local
residents off the welfare rolls.
  The Army Depot is the first closed military base to use the
economic development conveyance. Without it, Sacramento and
the Army might still be arguing about the value of the Depot,
according to Bill Farley, the city's economic development
manager. "When we first met Army officials, it was clear in a
few hours that we would never be able to agree on the value of
this real estate," he said. Army officials based their valuations
of the Depot based on the money they had poured into the base
over the years. City officials saw a group of outmoded buildings
that had to be rehabbed and marketed in a depressed real
estate market. Although he would not disclose the Army's
asking price for the Depot, Farley acknowledged that "we were
tens of millions of dollars apart. We could not even agree on
how to approach the method of valuing the property." In
contrast, "the economic development conveyance and the
profit-sharing provisions really took that extremely
contentious issue out of the equation," Farley said. Under the
plan, the city can sell portions of the base to private businesses,
and will eventually pass along $7 million to the Army in sales
and/or lease proceeds.
  Sacramento's initial reuse plan called for confining the Army
to a single portion of the base, while finding new uses for the
2.5 million square feet of buildings on the site. The city
planned to spend $19 million to clear out or refurbish old
Army  buildings ("These buildings were built to very high
standards, and they cost a fortune to demolish," Farley said.) To
market the Depot to private businesses, the city would
subdivide the base into individual parcels of 40 to 80 acres
apiece, and eventually to sell the parcels to private businesses
for a total of $15 million.
  Sacramento's great stroke of luck was the Northridge
earthquake of January 1994, which dislodged Packard Bell
from its plant in Northridge and sent the company looking for
potential new sites in less seismically active areas. In July,
Packard Bell officials asked Sacramento officials to identify
possible locations. The strongest selling point for the depot  was
the inclusion of the Army Depot in a State Enterprise Zone
program, which allows employers to take a tax credit of $6,000
for every disadvantaged worker hired, according to Debra
Nyland, an assistant economic development director for the
city. The credits enabled the company to save between $2 and
$4 million annually, according to Nyland.
  The agreement between the city and the computer maker was
a 20-year lease for 2 million square feet of rehabbed space for
$50 million. Annual lease payments began at $5 million and
drop to $2.5 million after the fifth year. In the tenth year the
company has an option to buy the property for $7 million, or
extend the lease for 35 years at $1.25 million annually. For its
part, the city provided a $17 million loan for tenant
improvements, plus a $9 million loan as a moving allowance.
The rents are higher in the first five years, so the city can
recoup the moving loan, which "was fairly risky because it was
unsecured," Farley explained. The tenant improvement loan is
being amortized over 12 years of lease payments.
  The city also indemnified Packard Bell against any costs
relating to environmental issues. Although the military clearly
has the responsibility for any environmental clean-up issues
under CERCLA, the federal Superfund law, the company
apparently wanted additional assurance.
  (Separate from the deal, the city also paid $800,000 to
relocate Vietnam Veterans of California, which was using the
site under the McKinney Act. The city has also requested other
public agencies, which have priority to take space in former
military bases, to forego the depot.)
  The Packard Bell lease negotiation was remarkable for its
speed. The company and the city struck a deal in less than two
months, and in September 1994 the deal was approved by
state lawmakers in 18 days. Packard Bell took occupancy of the
buildings in November, almost a month before it signed the
lease in December.
  The deal is all gravy to the Army, which spends nothing and
actually saves $1 million annually in maintenance costs for the
Packard Bell facility.
  Farley describes the economic development conveyance as "a
great tool" for local governments. Cities, he said, are "in the
business of redeveloping properties through various programs
the state has created. We never had a tool to accomplish the
same tasks with military bases, so this really makes the city
into a player in the redevelopment of the base."
  Despite the national publicity on the success of the depot
conversion, Farley was quick to add that the city's work is not
done. "As you start to build new facilities, and add onto the
existing infrastructure of the base, it leads to certain problems."
One problem is a $1 million "catch up" fee that the Sacramento
County regional sewer plant is attempting to charge the base.
(When the Depot was a military base, it was exempted from
sewer fees. Now that the depot is under local control, the
sewage plant is attempting to bill the depot for all the fees it
had not paid while it was still under military control.)
  Listed for closure in 1991, the 480-acre Depot officially closed
in March. The Army remains on 80 acres of the facility.

LISTING OF SPECIES STALLED

  A Republican attempt to block new endangered species
listings by denying appropriations for the listing process has
been upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
decision is likely to hold up attempts to list more than 100
species in California alone.
  Overturning a district court judge's ruling, a three-judge panel
of the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt missed the statutory deadline for making a decision on
whether to list the California red-legged frog as endangered.
But the court found that Babbitt "is unable to comply with his
listing duty under the Act" because Congress rescinded listing
funds in last year's appropriation and has continued the ban on
new listings in the continuing resolutions during this fiscal year
as well.
  The ruling came even though the statutory deadline for listing
the frog occurred before last year's appropriation bill was
passed.
  The ruling, written by Judge Betty Fletcher, contained a stern
warning against legislation by appropriation and stated that
the Endangered Species Act is still in full force despite the
appropriation bill. Quoting TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (the so-
called "snail darter" case), Fletcher said: "Repeal of legislation
by implication is disfavored," especially when "the claimed
repeal rests solely in an Appropriations Act."
  Ultimately, however, Fletcher concluded that Babbitt was
prohibited from making a final determination by the terms of a
rider to the 1995 appropriation bill. "The use of any
government resources P whether salaries, employees, paper, or
buildings P to accomplish a final listing would entail
government expenditure," she wrote. "The government cannot
make expenditures and therefore cannot act, other than by
appropriation."
  The red-legged frog case was widely watched because the
listing process has been halted on 120 species in California and
240 nationwide.
  The 1995 appropriation bill specifically rescinded $1.5 million
allocated for listing and determination of critical habitat and
also stated that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service cannot use any
other funds for this purpose. Originally passed on April 10,
1995, this rider has been contained in the continuing
resolutions passed to keep the government operating during
the recent budget negotiations.
  At the time the rider was passed, the Fish & Wildlife Service
was already engaged in lengthy litigation with the
Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara over the listing
of the red-legged frog. Under the Endangered Species Act,
Babbitt should have made a final determination on whether to
list the frog by July 19, 1993. When Babbitt missed the
deadline, EDC sued, but the two parties eventually agreed to a
settlement agreement requiring a final decision by November
1, 1993.
  Babbitt missed that deadline also, however, and EDC sued
again. Finally, the Fish & Wildlife Service published a proposed
listing on the Federal Register on February 2, 1994. Under the
Endangered Species Act, Babbitt then had one year P until
February 2, 1995 P to make a final decision on the listing.
Babbitt missed the deadline again, and EDC sued in May of
1995. By then, however, the appropriations rider was in effect.
  U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles issued
summary judgment in favor of the EDC and ordered Babbitt to
take a final action by September 15, 1995. However, the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a stay of this order and the Ninth Circuit
heard the case on an expedited schedule.
  In Fletcher's ruling, the Ninth Circuit ordered the final listing
"delayed until a reasonable time after appropriated funds are
made available" and ordered Real to establish the time frame.

STATE SUPREME COURT LAYS DOWN CC&R RULE

  The California Supreme Court has ruled that CC&Rs
(covenants, conditions, and restrictions) in two Woodside
subdivisions should be enforceable even though they are not
mentioned in the subdivisions' property deeds. In the process,
the court majority laid down a sweeping new rule to govern
the enforceability of private property covenants: If restrictions
are recorded before the sale of property, "the later purchaser is
deemed to agree with them."
  The controversial ruling may be the first step toward clearing
up a complicated real property law issue and is likely to have
an important impact on private land-use restrictions. "It's a
good decision," said UCLA law professor Susan French, one of
the leading scholars in the area of private covenants.
  But it may also lead to further confusion, because the court
declared that the new rule should be applied retrospectively
and because it declares that all information about a piece of
property need not be included in the deed. In a strong dissent,
Justice Joyce Kennard wrote that the ruling will transform
deeds "that on their face are unrestricted conveyances of the
landowner's entire interest into deeds conveying only a portion
of the landowner's interest." (French disputed Kennard's view,
saying that the restrictions will turn up in title reports.)
  The case drew the attention of many outside groups, including
the California Association of Realtors, the California Building
Industry Association, and the Coastal Commission, all of whom
intervened on behalf of the neighbors seeking to enforce the
CC&Rs. The Coastal Commission argued that if all CC&Rs must be
included in deeds, the agency's many not be able to enforce
conditions it imposes on new development projects along the
coast.
  The role of CC&Rs in land-use planning and regulation is
growing. Especially in California, more and more planned
communities are created with a "private" municipal
government made up of homeowner associations that enforce
private deed covenants.
  However, as CC&Rs have grown in number they have also
generated a lot of complicated litigation about how, when, and
by whom they can be enforced. French has called the law
surrounding CC&Rs "the most complex and archaic body of
American property law remaining in the 20th Century." Several
recent appellate court rulings have dealt with CC&Rs. Last
September, the Court of Appeal ruled that a homeowner
association may record a notice of violation with the county
recorder even though such actions are sometimes taken
because they are cheaper than suing the homeowner.
(California Riviera Homeowners Association v. Superior Court,
CP&DR Legal Digest, October 1995.) The Supreme Court
decertified this case shortly before issuing its ruling in the
Woodside case.
  The new case involves Jared and Anne Anderson, who bought
two parcels of property in Woodside and obtained a conditional
use permit from the city to operate a winery. The two parcels
were originally part of two separate subdivisions, each of
whose subdividers had recorded CC&Rs restricting the property
to residential use. Claiming that the Andersons had violated the
CC&Rs, a group of neighbors organized as the Citizens for
Covenant Compliance and sued the Andersons. However, the
Andersons claimed they had no knowledge of the CC&Rs
because there was no reference to them in the deeds of either
parcel they had purchased.
  San Mateo Superior Court Judge Harlan K. Veal ruled that the
CC&Rs were not enforceable, and the First District Court of
Appeal affirmed. But on a 6-1 vote, the Supreme Court
overturned the lower ruling and declared the covenants
enforceable despite the defects in the deed, establishing the
new rule in the process. "The CC&Rs of this case were recorded
before any of the parcels were sold ... they state an intent to
establish a general plan for the subdivisions binding on all
purchasers and their successors; and they describe the
property they are to govern," wrote Justice Armand Arabian
for the majority. "...Therefore ... the fact that the individual
deeds do not reference them is not fatal to their enforceability."
  To arrive at the new rule, Justice Arabian's majority opinion
reached deep into the legal history of easements, covenants,
and equitable servitude (sometimes known as restrictive
covenants), all of which seek to govern the enforceability of
private land use restrictions. Traditionally, a covenant is a
restriction that "runs with the land" because it affects the use
of the land in some way.  Beginning in the 19th Century,
English and then American courts adopted the doctrine of
equitable servitude, which permits enforceability of covenants
that would not be strictly enforceable under the doctrine of
covenants. Because the Woodside covenants impose a burden
on the property P rather than simply a benefit P and because
they are agreed to between grantor and grantee P rather than
between landowners P they fall under the doctrine of equitable
servitude and not covenants.
  Legal scholars have noted that legal doctrines surrounding
covenants and equitable servitude are similar and perhaps
should be combined. California law treats them similarly, and
in the majority opinion Arabian stated that the Supreme
Court's new rule should apply equally to both doctrines.
  In reaching his conclusions on the Woodside case, Arabian
said that the basic issue was not whether the restrictions run
with the land but whether they ever took effect in the first
place given the fact that they are not mentioned in the deeds.
The Andersons argued that the CC&Rs never took effect
because they were not mentioned in the deeds. But Arabian
said that accepting this argument would lead to "byzantine"
results. What if some deeds included the CC&Rs and others did
not? According to case law, he concluded, any property sold
subsequent to the first property whose deed mentioned the
CC&Rs would be subject to the CC&Rs P even if the particular
deed in question did not mention them. Claiming that this
greatly complicates title searches, Arabian said the result
would be a "crazy-quilt pattern of uses."
  In laying down the new rule, Arabian stated: "The overall
plan, and not individual deeds, should determine what
restrictions are in effect, and between whom." He also
concluded that the rule should apply retrospectively.
  In her dissent, Justice Kennard wrote that the new rule "blasts
a gaping hole through the structure of real property law that
has been painstakingly erected by the Legislature and by the
courts over the past century." She said that the rule will allow
"for the unilateral creation of enforceable land use restrictions,
contrary to established law," and that it will deny constructive
notice to land purchasers under state law. She also stated that
retrospective application of the new rule will wreak havoc
throughout the state. Noting that land subdivision in California
dates back to the 1860s, she said: "If the subdivider of any of
these thousands of lands recorded a plan of common
restrictions for the lots but conveyed the lots by unrestricted
grant deeds, retroactive application of the majority's new rule
will now bring those restrictions to life no matter how long
they have lain dormant."

APPELLATE COURT STRIKES DOWN FRESNO-AREA ARTS TAX

  Fresno's so-called "Arts-to-Zoo" tax violates the California
constitution because the organization that administers the tax
is a private entity, the Fifth District Court of Appeal has ruled.
  The Fresno Metropolitan Projects Authority was created by
the state legislature in 1993 as a vehicle for administering a
1/10-cent sales tax in the Freno area for cultural facilities.
Fresno-area voters approved the tax by a 57% majority in
1993. Under the Government Code, half of the tax proceeds are
distributed to the local zoo, the philharmonic orchestra, and
two museums, 25% are distributed for cultural programs, and
25% are distributed for a variety of other purposes including
capital improvements for cultural facilities. The authority is
governed by a 13-member board. As specified in the law, the
city and the county each choose one board member. The other
11 members are selected by such organizations as the Parent
Teachers Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the local
taxpayers association, the Farm Bureau, the Fresno-Madera
Central Labor Council, the League of Mexican-American
Women, the West Fresno Ministerial Alliance, and the local
division of the California Retired Teachers Association.
  The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association sued and claimed
that the state law creating the authority was a violation of
Article XI, section 11 of the state constitution, which prohibits
the legislature from delegating the power to tax to a private
entity. Fresno County Superior Court Judge Stephen J. Kane
ruled in favor of the Jarvis group and the Fifth District affirmed
his ruling.
  Before the Fifth District, the Metropolitan Authority made a
series of arguments, including the argument that it is a public
body because it performs public functions. But the court
pointed out that only two of its 13 board members are
appointed by public bodies. "The electorate cannot remove
those who are chosen as director of the Authority and the
electorate cannot remove those who choose," wrote Presiding
Justice James Ardaiz for the court. "But the electorate must
bear the consequences of the decisions of those who compose
the authority. ... As we see it this is a distinction that marks the
Authority as a private body."
  The Metropolitan Authority also argued that the tax was
levied by the people and not by the Authority, but the court
rejected that argument, stating that the law specifically
authorizes the Authority to levy the tax. The court also
concluded that voter approval did not render the constitutional
provision inapplicable to this particular tax, as the Authority
claimed.
  "The voters have no say in the matter of fund distribution for
the next 20 years short of repeal of the entire tax," wrote
Ardaiz. "This appears to us to be precisely the type of situation
the framers sought to avoid by prohibiting the delegation to a
private body of the power to tax."
  Finally, Ardaiz rejected the Metropolitan Authority's
argument that its "regional" nature exempts it from the
constitutional provision in question. The court's review of case
law, he concluded, "leads us to conclude that the present article
XI, section 11 means just what it says: that the  Legislature
may not delegate to a private person or body the power to levy
taxes. The section does not contain any exception for any
particular type of tax, 'regional' or otherwise."

SUPP EIS NOT NEEDED FOR DOPPLER WEATHER STATION

  The federal government did not need to prepare a
supplemental environmental impact statement for a Doppler
weather radar tower atop Sulfur Mountain in Ventura County,
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled.
  Environmental review of the weather station was challenged
by the Environmental Coalition of Ojai and two individual Ojai
residents including actor Larry Hagman. Among other things,
the Environmental Coalition claimed that the federal
government should have prepared a supplemental EIS just for
the Ojai site and that other environmental documents should
have been updated to reflect new research about the
environmental health dangers of radiation from the weather
system. However, the Environmental Coalition has lost the case
all the way down the line and the Sulfur Mountain facility is
now in operation.
  The Sulfur Mountain station is part of the National Weather
Service's national modernization program known as NEXRAD
(for Next Generation Weather Radar). The system is being
constructed jointly by the Commerce, Transportation, and
Defense departments. Doppler radar systems must be located
away from "electronic pollution" contained in metropolitan
areas.
  The Environmental Coalition originally asked U.S. District
Court Judge Terry Hatter to enjoin construction of the project
but he refused and eventually he granted summary judgment
in favor of the government. The Court of Appeals affirmed his
ruling.
  The NEXRAD system has been the subject of a long series of
environmental documents, including a programmatic EIS and a
supplemental environmental assessment, which examined the
environmental impact generally and the radiation issue
specifically. Based on this information, the government chose
not to produce a supplemental EIS for the NEXRAD program
and instead filed a finding of no significant impact, or FONSI, in
1993. (A FONSI is the equivalent of a negative declaration
under the National Environmental Policy Act.)
  With regard to the Sulphur Mountain site, the government
produced an initial environmental assessment in 1986 and an
in-depth site survey in 1987 and as a result of those
documents issued a FONSI for the site in 1989.
  The Environmental Coalition's case contained two key
components. First, the Coalition argued that the government
should have prepared a site-specific EIS for the Sulfur
Mountain site. And second, the Environmental Coalition argued
that the government should have done a supplemental EIS for
the whole NEXRAD program after new research on the radiation
became known.
  In ruling for the government, the Ninth Circuit relied heavily
on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Marsh v. Oregon Natural
Resources Council, 490 U.S. 360 (1989). In that case, the court
concluded that the federal government need not prepare a site-
specific EIS for every federal project. In the Sulfur Mountain
case, Judge Arthur Alarcon, writing for the Ninth Circuit, said:
"In its 1986 and 1987 site-specific EAs (environmental
assessments), the Government considered the environmental
impact of the NEXRAD installation on Sulfur Mountain. Having
determined that the Sulfur Mountain NEXRAD installation
would have no significant local environmental impact, the
government reasonably issued a FONSI in 1989 instead of
preparing a site-specific EIS."
  On the question of a supplemental EIS on the radiation issues,
Alarcon listed a long set of materials reviewed by the
government in its supplemental environmental assessment. "In
each instance," Alarcon wrote, "the Government found that
although initial studies suggested an association between RFR
[radar radiation] and ... diseases, more rigorous subsequent
studies either failed to confirm the initial results or yielded
negative findings." Based on this review the government
concluded that the radiation would not be an environmental
health hazard. "Accordingly, its previous conclusion that the
weather stations would have no significant adverse
environmental impact (published in the preliminary EIS)
remained valid," Alarcon wrote. "Therefore, the Government
determined that it was not necessary to prepare a
supplemental EIS."
  The court also rejected the Environmental Coalition's
argument that the government had failed to provide adequate
notice for the environmental documentation on both the radar
system generally and the Sulfur Mountain facility. The Ninth
Circuit concluded that Ojai citizens were not required to receive
specific notice on the nationwide system issues, and that the
government had satisfied notice requirements on the local
issues by filling documents  with state and local clearinghouses.

ECONOMYUS UP, BUT CONSTRUCTION ISNUT

  After showing signs of a rebound in 1994, California's
construction industry slid back into decline in 1995, reviving a
five-year dip in building activity in California. The renewed
slump confirms the break in relationship between building and
the rest of the economy here, and draws into question a range
of community development dictums that revolve around
growth.
  Two years ago, we announced that the sector that once set the
course of economic trends had instead become a follower
(CP&DR Numbers, January 1994). Last year, we reported that
construction experienced its first growth year in the last six
(CP&DR Numbers, January 1995.) All three sectors (residential,
non-residential, and heavy) experienced increases in total
construction dollars in 1994 relative to 1993, indicating that, at
long last, the building industry had rebounded.
  As it turned out, 1995 was the year that entertainment and
bio-tech replaced a goodly portion of the jobs lost in the
aerospace/defense industry, the year that home prices actually
began to climb in some of the state's zip codes, and the year
when even aerospace/defense saw some job growth linked to a
revival of some B-2 and  McDonnell Douglas passenger jet
orders. But the building industry took a dive again. With 10
months of data in hand, the Construction Industry Research
Board is forecasting a retraction year in total construction
dollars, led by slides in residential and heavy construction.
  If there is any economic bright spot, it is that the $29.9 billion
spent last year did not drop to the 13-year record low year of
1993, when only $28.8 billion were spent. The other positive
statistic is the employment data: though total construction
dollars are down, construction jobs enjoyed a second straight
year of growth.
  This is all quite confounding for industry watchers such as
Ben Bartolotto of the CIRB. After all, a year ago he had
predicted an 11.8% increase, rather than the 1.7% drop he now
estimates. (Final numbers will be available in March. ) "All of
the dynamics were in place: job growth, drops in vacancy P the
drop is frustrating," Bartolotto said. The job growth data
apparently reflects ongoing reconstruction or renovation that
does not show up in regular construction figures.
  Bartolotto suspects that the disconnect between employment
and housing demand may be resulting from lower levels of real
personal income compared to, say, 10 years ago. And this time,
L.A. cannot be blamed for holding the state back: of the 25
markets surveyed by CIRB, Los Angeles-Long Beach, along with
San Francisco and Santa Barbara County, were the only housing
markets that increased housing construction from 1994 to
1995. Rates from other types of construction varied widely be
region, but one thing has emerged as constant: the building
industry is not a reliable indicator of economic health in
California. And a healthy economy does not necessarily
translate into a booming building industry.
  The lesson may be an important one for planners, who should
P now more than ever P think about implementing community
goals in ways that do not rely on new construction activity.
  Which brings us to the forecast for building in 1996: Does
anybody still care? Once again, the CIRB calls for a comeback
year, with an 11.9% increase in overall dollar spent. This is
expected to be paced by a strong surge in housing construction,
with a 29.8% increase in activity over 1995. Cynical as one is
tempted to become about such forecasts, it is true that the
housing industry seems to be poised for some kind of
turnaround. Analysts have been saying that the pent-up
demand for housing may find an outlet as potential buyers
come to market in order to avoid the 2.5% increase in prices
expected in 1996. But one thing we have learned: We won't
draw any conclusions about the larger economy based on the
construction industry.

REMAKING DOWNTOWN FRESNO

  The Fulton District in Downtown Fresno has much in common
with other aging city centers across the state: high vacancy
rates in older buildings, out-of-date infrastructure, inadequate
parking, a perception of crime, and a general lack of vital
pedestrian activity. The district also has a number of positive
attributes, including a number of existing cultural institutions,
most notably the Fresno Metropolitan Museum, which attracts
250,000 visitors annually.
  The "Met," as it is known locally, is in an expansion mode, and
museum directors have acknowledged that a bigger and better
Met needs to be supported by other institutions in the
immediate area. The notion of a cultural district was already
suggested in the downtown master plan created in 1993 by
developer Wayne Ratkovich, and some city officials view the
area as the cultural center not only for the city but for a 125-
mile radius of the San Joaquin Valley. A team of consultants,
made up of Keyser Marston Associates, Barry Howard Limited,
and RTKL Associates Inc., have proposed a cultural district,
with the Met serving as the nucleus, surrounded by at least six
other museum or museum expansion sites, including new
locations for the Afro-American Museum and Arte de
Americas.
  The cultural district would be buttressed by an
entertainment/retail district immediately southwest, anchored
by that tried-and-true generator of urban foot traffic: a multi-
plex cinema, which is expected to bring in 1 million people
annually. The pedestrian quality of the cultural district could
benefit from another proposal to convert one-way streets to
two-directional traffic. Neo-traditional designers favor two-
way traffic as a means to slow traffic and make streets more
comfortable for pedestrians, although few cities have had the
gumption to convert one-way streets P a favorite of traffic
planners P back to two-way traffic.
  A strength of the plan is the high number of existing and
proposed museums oriented on Van Ness Avenue. The plan
identifies at least two vacant lots on important thoroughfares
as parking sites, which could blight the experience for
pedestrians, unless the parking structures incorporate street-
level retail. The plan has been approved by the museum's
board of directors, and is awaiting a vote by the Fresno city
council.
  1. The Fresno Metropolitan Museum. This well-attended
institution is the anchor of the area, and seeks to expand into
neighboring buildings (2) and (3).
  4. A multi-plex theater is the "traffic generator" of the Fulton
District, and is hoped to attract up enough visitors to activate"
the downtown district. To handle the parking, the museums
and other buildings would make parking available to the
theater on evenings and weekends.
  5. Multi-plex parking.
  6. Proposed future site of the Asian Museum.
  7. Proposed future site of the Afro-American Museum.
  8. Proposed future site of Arte de Americas.
  9. Fulton Street. Two-way traffic is proposed for this one-way
street.
  10. Van Ness Avenue.
  11. Existing theaters: the Wilson and the Warnor.
  12. Proposed museum/museum expansion sites.
  13. Proposed surface parking.
  14. Fulton Street.
