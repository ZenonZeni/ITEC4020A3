Microorganisms have a profound impact on the composition of the Earth's

atmosphere, waters and soils, and thereby influence all life processes. Microbes

play key roles in the cycling of bioactive elements, such as C and N, in aquatic

ecosystems and in the transfer of these elements and energy into complex food

webs. Bacterial growth and activity in these systems is supported primarily by

non-living organic matter in both dissolved and particulate form. In the oceans,

dissolved organic matter (DOM) is by far the most abundant form of organic

carbon whereas in rivers and estuaries particulate organic matter (POM) is also

an important substrate supporting bacterial growth. DOM and POM are chemically

complex and are derived from a variety of sources. A primary research objective

is to characterize the compositions, sources, microbial transformations, and

fates of DOM and POM. In the open oceans, carbohydrates are major reactive

components of the DOM and ongoing studies are investigating rates of bacterial

utilization of carbohydrates and the factors controling bacterial growth and

respiration. Research on DOM and POM in the Amazon and Mississippi Rivers

indicates that it is derived from decaying vascular plant material in soils. The

DOM and POM in the rivers is rich in aromatic components, such as tannins and

lignins, and is highly resistant to bacterial oxidation. Bacterial growth in

these systems is relatively inefficient and is limited by the availability of

organic carbon.
