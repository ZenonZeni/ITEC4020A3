<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P>

<P>Detection Limit Technology (DLT) provides data acquisition services for all vehicles
under HEVDP's '93 and '94 programs. These services include: data acquisition systems,
sensors, powertrain monitors, electric vehicle local controller and battery management
systems; and data logger replacements for electric vehicles. 
</P>

<P><B>Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) </B></P>

<P>The DAS consists of an expandable 12 bit analog to digital sensor controller (SC) which
digitizes the analog signals from the sensors. The SC is also equipped with a frequency
counter to accept signals from the speedometer/odometer. The computing and logging
functions are performed by a 386SX based embedded PC (EPC). For driver interaction,
it uses a handheld keyboard with a 32 character, 8 line LCD display. The SC is
connected to the EPC via a RS232 serial port. IDLMS100 is the application software that
controls the system. It logs data, provides useful data for the driver in an easy to read
format, simple single key operation, intelligent switching from drive mode to charge mode
and back, checks for low stateofcharge and alarm levels, and real time data analysis to
keep track of stateofcharge, mileage, and min./max. values of parameters. The system
also has an automatic powerup/powerdown option. This allows the system to be a fully
automatic "turnkey" system. The sensors were designed especially for the noisy
environment of an electric vehicle, utilizing temperature compensated halleffects that
makes the sensors completely isolated from the parameters being measured . The
signals are conditioned and filtered for clean and accurate data. DH sensors measure
DC voltage, DC current, and temperature. WAV sensors measure true RMS AC voltage,
true RMS AC current, true power, and temperature. AT sensors measure altitude, tilt, and
temperature. DB sensors measure accessories' on/off. Payload Sensors for the '94
program are in the design stages. These sensors will incorporate Linear Voltage
Displacement Transducer (LVDT) technology which conveys vehicle payload to the DAS
when hooked to the coil or leaf springs. Input AC power sensors will also be installed
under the '94 program. 
</P>

<P><B>Powertrain Monitors</B></P>

<P>Powertrain Monitors for the '94 program are in the design stages. They will monitor the
true RMS AC voltage, true RMS AC current, and true power between the motor and
controller. The biggest obstacle is accessing the cables of interest. DLT has been
working with Hughes Power Control Systems to resolve this problem. </P>

<P><B>Controller and Battery Management Systems </B></P>

<P>Electric vehicle local controller and battery management systems (BMS) for the '94
program are also in the design stages. The local controller will provide range estimation,
speedometer/odometer, input and output for control, and output ports for data logging.
The BMS will level voltage of batteries, determine stateofcharge, and provide a
programmable platform for fast and regular charging methods. </P>

<B>Project Deliverables:</B>

Data Acquisition Systems 

<P>DLT has designed and built ten complete DAS. Six have been installed in electric
vehicles in the 93 program. Installation of the other four DAS await delivery of vehicles.
Auto powerup/powerdown option has been built and installed in three of ten vehicles in
the '94 program. Sensors have been installed in 27 of the 35 vehicles in the '93 program;
the remaining eight will be installed during component retrofits operations by the vehicle
manufacturer. One of 30 input AC power sensors in the '94 program have been installed.
Five vehicles will be equipped with payload sensors. One of 30 AC infest Dower sensors
has been installed.</P> 

<P><B>Powertrain Monitors</B> </P>

<P>Five vehicles will be equipped with powertrain monitors. </P>

<P><B>Controller and Battery Management Systems</B></P> 

<P>Twenty vehicles will be equipped with the BMS system for the '94 program. </P>

<B>Project Schedule: </B>

<P>Data Acquisition Systems</P> 

<P>Six of ten DAS systems have been installed. Three systems will be installed by March 31,
1996. One awaits delivery of the vehicle by the manufacturer. Six auto
powerup/powerdown options will be installed by March 31, 1996. The remaining one
awaits delivery of the vehicle; tentative date is May 1996. Sensors have been installed in
27 vehicles; the remaining eight sensor packages should be installed by July 31, 1996.
Payload Sensor fabrication should begin in August 1996. Twentynine AC input power
sensors will be installed over the next 12 months. </P>

<B>Powertrain Monitors</B>

<P>Fabrication should begin in June 1996. </P>

<P><B>Controller and Battery Management Systems</B></P> 

<P>Fabrication should begin in October 1996.</P>
