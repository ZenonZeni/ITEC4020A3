ABOLITION 2000
</title></head>
<body> <pre>
ABOLITION 2000
STATEMENT

     A secure and livable world for our children and grandchildren and al=
l
future generations requires that we achieve a world free of nuclear weapo=
ns
and redress the environmental degradation and human suffering that is the
legacy of fifty years of nuclear weapons testing and production.

     Further, the inextricable link between the "peaceful" and warlike us=
es of
nuclear technologies and the threat to future generations inherent in cre=
ation
and use of long-lived radioactive materials must be recognized.  We must
move toward reliance on clean, safe, renewable forms of energy production
that do not provide the materials for weapons of mass destruction and do =
not
poison the environment for thousands of centuries.  The true "inalienable=
"
right is not to nuclear energy, but to life, liberty and security of pers=
on in a
world free of nuclear weapons.

     We recognize that a nuclear weapons free world must be achieved
carefully and in a step by step manner.  We are convinced of its technolo=
gical
feasibility.  Lack of political will, especially on the part of the nucle=
ar
weapons states, is the only true barrier.  As chemical and biological wea=
pons
are prohibited, so must nuclear weapons be prohibited.

     We call upon all states -- particularly the nuclear weapons states, =
declared
and de facto -- to take the following steps to achieve nuclear weapons
abolition.  We further urge the states parties to the NPT to demand bindi=
ng
commitments by the declared nuclear weapons states to implement these
measures:

     1)  Initiate immediately and conclude by the year 2000 negotiations =
on a
nuclear weapons abolition convention that requires the phased elimination=
 of
all nuclear weapons within a timebound framework, with provisions for
effective verification and enforcement.*

     2)  Immediately make an unconditional pledge not to use or threaten =
to use
nuclear weapons.

     3)  Rapidly complete a truly comprehensive test ban treaty with a ze=
ro
threshold and with the stated purpose of precluding nuclear weapons
development by all states.

     4)  Cease to produce and deploy new and additional nuclear weapons
systems, and commence to withdraw and disable deployed nuclear weapons
systems.

     5)  Prohibit the military and commercial production and reprocessing=
 of all
weapons-usable radioactive materials.

     6)  Subject all weapons-usable radioactive materials and nuclear fac=
ilities
in all states to international accounting, monitoring, and safeguards, an=
d
establish a public international registry of all weapons-usable radioacti=
ve
materials.

     7)  Prohibit nuclear weapons research, design, development, and test=
ing
through laboratory experiments including but not limited to non-nuclear
hydrodynamic explosions and computer simulations, subject all nuclear
weapons laboratories to international monitoring, and close all nuclear t=
est
sites.

     8)  Create additional nuclear weapons free zones such as those estab=
lished
by the treaties of Tlatelolco and Rarotonga.

     9) Recognize and declare the illegality of threat or use of nuclear =
weapons,
publicly and before the World Court.

     10)  Establish an international energy agency to promote and support=
 the
development of sustainable and environmentally safe energy sources.

     11) Create mechanisms to ensure the participation of citizens and NG=
Os in
planning and monitoring the process of nuclear weapons abolition.

     A world free of nuclear weapons is a shared aspiration of humanity. =
 This
goal cannot be achieved in a non-proliferation regime that authorizes the
possession of nuclear weapons by a small group of states.  Our common
security requires the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Our object=
ive
is definite and unconditional abolition of nuclear weapons.

* The convention should mandate irreversible disarmament measures, includ=
ing but not
limited to the following: withdraw and disable all deployed nuclear weapo=
ns systems; disable
and dismantle warheads; place warheads and weapons-usable radioactive mat=
erials under
international safeguards; destroy ballistic missiles and other delivery s=
ystems.  The
convention could also incorporate the measures listed above which should =
be implemented
independently without delay.  When fully implemented, the convention woul=
d replace the
NPT.
