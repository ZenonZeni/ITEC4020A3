<P><IMG Align=Left SRC="golding.gif" ALT="Photo of Michael Goulding">Michael Goulding received his Ph.D. from UCLA in 1978. Goulding's research focuses on tropical ecology, conservation biology, Amazon wildlife and natural history photography. He has lived for over 16 years in the Amazon Basin, most of which was in the employ of Brazil's two principal rainforest institutes, INPA and the Goeldi Museum. His work has enabled him to explore more Amazonian rivers for wildlife than anyone in history. He has published six books and numerous articles on the Amazon and tropical ecology. For his studies on Amazon fish, he received the Alexandre Rodriguez Ferreira gold medal from the Brazilian Zoological society. In addition to research endeavers, he established a natural history filming network in the Amazon and worked as scientific director and consultant for various films made for the BBC, National Geographic, ABC and Partridge Films. He was featured in a National Geographic special for his work on Amazon Rivers. Goulding has received major funding for Amazon conservation biology from the Brazilian government, WWF-US, Conservation International, the Alton-Jones Foundation and the Tinker Foundation. He has consulted on environmental issues with the World Bank, Microsoft and eco-tourism organizations. With colleagues in Brazil, he is presently finishing a trilogy of conservation biology books sponsored by the Rainforest Alliance, the National Institute of Amazonian Research and the Goeldi Museum.<BR>
