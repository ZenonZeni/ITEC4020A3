<h2>7. Yankee Hindoos</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Orient's first substantial impact upon America
occurred in a rather indirect manner, in 1492. Or the actual date
might be placed two centuries earlier: it could well be argued
that America owes its discovery to the Great Khan Kublai, lord of
the Tartars, for the hospitality he showed Marco Polo in the
thirteenth century. Columbus of course discovered the new
continent while searching for the fabulous Cathay about which
Marco Polo had written&#151;and there is some irony in the fact
that Polo's book contains one of the earliest accounts of the
psychedelic experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Passing through Persia, the Venetian merchant
learned the history of the Old Man of the Mountain, who lived in
a castle which concealed a magnificent hidden valley. The Old Man
invited youths to the castle, drugged them with hashish, and had
them carried into the Valley of Delights, where they were wined
and dined and entertained by dainty damsels. After four or five
days the youths were carried back into the castle and told they
had been in the Moslem Paradise. The Old Man could send them
there any time he wanted, he said, if they would carry out his
wishes&#151;which usually meant killing somebody. This band of
happy cutthroats became known as &quot;hashshashins,&quot; from
which we have derived the word <i>assassin</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The barbarian invasions and the fall of Rome had
cut the old Silk Road into Hither Asia, and later the Crusades
served to divert Europe's attention still further from the
Orient. There had been virtually no contact whatever between East
and West when Marco Polo arrived in Tartary with his father and
uncle, and indeed the Polos were the first Westerners Kublai Khan
had ever seen. The promise of a restored relationship was
shattered when the Chinese overthrew the Tartars and slammed the
door on foreigners; then the Turks spread across Central Asia,
effectively padlocking the door&#151;and just incidentally
forcing Columbus to seek a sea route to Cathay. The English
penetrated India by the late seventeenth century, following the
Portuguese; but China kept all foreign devils out until the
middle of the last century, and Japan was a <i>terra incognita</i>
until Admiral Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay in 1853. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is understandable, then, that America was a long
time making its own discovery of the East. The young country's
first real introduction to Asian philosophy was provided by the
New England Transcendentalists, whose writings were often a
bewildering blend of Unitarianism and Orientalism, of Yankee
self-reliance and Hindu self-abnegation. The influence of
Romantic idealism and German philosophy also was evident. Thus
readers of <i>The Dial</i> in 1841 found themselves asking, with
Frederic Henry Hedge: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hath this world, without me wrought,<br>
    Other substance than my thought?<br>
    Lives it by my sense alone,<br>
    Or by essence of its own? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Margaret Fuller wrote of Man as a whole: &quot;As
this whole has one soul and one body, any injury or obstruction
to a part, or to the meanest member, affects the whole. Man can
never be perfectly happy or virtuous till all men are so.&quot;
Thoreau wrote of his inspiration: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I hear beyond the range of sound,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I see beyond the range of sight,<br>
    New earths and skies and seas around,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my day the sun doth pale his light.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It speaks with such authority,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; With so serene and lofty tone,<br>
    That idle Time runs gadding by,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And leaves me with Eternity alone.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Such fragrance round my couch it makes,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; More rich than are Arabian drugs,<br>
    That my soul scents its life and wakes<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The body up beneath its perfumed rugs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the last stanza suggests, Thoreau undoubtedly
would have no part of LSD were he alive today. In <i>Walden</i>
he observed, &quot;I prefer the natural sky to an opium-eater's
heaven.&quot; The point is, however, that Thoreau could turn
himself on, needing only that natural sky for a psychedelic, and
he was wholly preoccupied with the modes of inmost being. There
was no object in going around the world to count the cats in
Zanzibar, he said. &quot;Be rather the Mungo Park, the Lewis and
Clark and Frobisher, of your own streams and oceans.... Nay, be a
Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening
new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is the lord
of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but a
petty state, a hummock left by the ice.... it is easier to sail
many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals, in a
government ship, with five hundred men and boys to assist one,
than it is to explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific
Ocean of one's being alone.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the dualism of good and evil: &quot;I love
to see that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be
afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another....
The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence.
Poison is not poisonous after all, nor are any wounds
fatal.&quot; As for the verbal mind: &quot;I know not the first
letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was
not as wise as the day I was born.&quot; As for the rational
sense of time: &quot;Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I
drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect
how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity
remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is
pebbly with stars.&quot; And as for the comforts of formal
religion: &quot;I believe that men are generally still a little
afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and
Christianity and candles have been introduced.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One passage in <i>Walden</i> strikes a particularly
responsive chord for psychedelic cultists. Indeed, William James
singled out the same passage as exemplifying those moments we all
have &quot;when the universal life seems to wrap us round with
friendliness&quot; and those hours &quot;when the goodness and
beauty of existence enfold us like a dry warm climate, or chime
through us as if our inner ears were subtly ringing with the
world's security.&quot; The oft-quoted passage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have never felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a
    sense of solitude, but once, and that was a few weeks after I
    came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the near
    neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and happy
    life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the
    same time conscious of a light insanity in my mood, and
    seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain
    while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of
    such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very
    pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around
    my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at
    once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied
    advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have
    never thought of them since. Every little pine needle
    expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was
    distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to
    me, even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and
    dreary, and also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest
    was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no place
    could ever be strange to me again.... &quot;How vast and
    profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven and
    of Earth! We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them;
    we seek to hear them, and we do not hear them; identified
    with the substance of things, they cannot be separated from
    them.&quot; . . . I only know myself as a human entity; the
    scene, so to speak, of thoughts and affections; and am
    sensible of a certain doubleness by which I can stand as
    remote from myself as from another. However intense my
    experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a
    part of me, which, as it were, is not a part of me, but
    spectator, sharing no experience, but taking note of it, and
    that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it may be
    the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It
    was a kind of fiction, a work of the imagination only, so far
    as he was concerned. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One wonders whether Huxley's antagonist R. C.
Zaehner would dismiss that as natural mysticism or as monistic
mysticism, or possibly as both. Theistic it is not. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Emerson probably did more than anybody else in his
time to translate Eastern ideas, as he understood them, into the
American idiom. He informed his readers about a school of
thought, across the sea, which held that &quot;what we call
Nature, the external world, has no real existence&#151;is only
phenomenal. Youth, age, property, conditions, events,
persons&#151;self, even&#151; are successive <i>maias</i>
(deceptions) through which Vishnu mocks and instructs the
soul.&quot; He added his opinion: &quot;I think Hindoo books the
best gymnastics for the mind, as showing treatment. All European
libraries might almost be read without the swing of this gigantic
arm being suspected. But these Orientals deal with worlds and
pebbles freely.&quot; Emerson's poetry is freighted with Eastern
imagery, and his &quot;Brahma,&quot; for example, is almost a
literal rendering of a passage from the <i>Katha Upanishad</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the red slayer think he slays,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Or if the slain think he is slain,<br>
    They know not well the subtle ways<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I keep, and pass, and turn again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Yankee monists, Transcendentalism had this to
offer: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I am the owner of the sphere,<br>
    Of the seven stars and the solar year,<br>
    Of Caesar's hand and Plato's brain,<br>
    Of Lord Christ's heart and Shakespeare's strain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As with Blake, Walt Whitman's poetry as a whole
seems to reflect the viewpoint of Eastern mysticism. In his later
years Whitman gives the impression of somehow being in a
permanent state of <i>satori</i>, and James indeed suggested that
Whitman probably had &quot;a chronic mystical perception.&quot;
Rather tempting bait for speculation is offered by the fact that
Whitman for so many years was little more than a journalistic
hack. What was the source, then, of the inspiration which gave us
<i>Leaves of Grass</i>? Following Wasson, it might be asserted
that the Good Gray Poet at some period in his life was introduced
to hashish or peyote or some other psychedelic, perhaps on that
trip he made to New Orleans. The idea is farfetched, and we shall
not pursue it; the fact remains that, spontaneously or otherwise,
Whitman suddenly began to write poetry which echoes and re-echoes
with Oriental and psychedelic intuitions: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>
    And what I assume you shall assume,<br>
    For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe it wasn't hashish; maybe it was Hegel.
According to an 1882 entry in <i>Specimen Days</i>, the most
profound theme to occupy the mind of man is the relation between
the Me and the Not Me of the universe. And while Kant and
Schelling perhaps had supplied us with partial answers, &quot;G.
F. Hegel's fuller statement of the matter probably remains the
last best word that has been said upon it . . . illuminating the
thought of the universe, and satisfying the mystery thereof to
the human mind, with a more consoling scientific assurance than
any yet.&quot; Long before that entry was made, however, Whitman
had written in his journal of 1847: &quot;I cannot understand the
mystery, but I am always conscious of myself as two&#151;-as my
soul and I.&quot; He was not contained between his hat and boots,
he later wrote. There also was &quot;the unseen soul of me.&quot;
There also was the square deific, the One. There also was: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Santa Spirita, breather, life,<br>
    Beyond the light, lighter than light . . .<br>
    Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me what were all? what
    were God?)<br>
    Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent,
    positive,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; (namely the unseen.) <br>
    Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man,<br>
    I, the general soul . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And just in case anybody should have missed his
meaning: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>What do you suppose creation is?<br>
    What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk
    free<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; and own no superior?<br>
    What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred
    ways,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; but that man or woman is as good as God?<br>
    And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?<br>
    And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally
    mean? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the general soul, read Brahman or pure Being;
for Yourself, read Atman. Clearly, if Wordsworth speaks for the
mescal drinkers, Whitman deserves consideration as the poet
laureate of LSD. He also hinted at an esoteric doctrine of
reincarnation, especially in &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,&quot;
and, like Thoreau and the three monkeys, he heard, saw, and spoke
no evil. As we shall see, the innocent denial of evil in the
universe is the basis for one of the principal charges that would
later be lodged against Whitman, just as it is lodged now against
the psychedelic drug movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; America was given another injection of Eastern
metaphysics in 1875, when the Theosophical Society was founded in
New York City by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Henry Steele
Olcott. Madame Blavatsky, a Russian, said that she had studied
under an Eastern master in Tibet, and the Theosophists were
effective in promoting many Hindu and Buddhist concepts including
reincarnation, the monistic brotherhood of man, and the direct,
mystical knowledge of a Universal Self. At the turn of the
century, James's classic study of religious experience had a
profound and lasting influence on theology and psychology; it
opened the eyes of scholars and laymen to whole new realms of
consciousness, probing deeply into the mystical awareness of East
and West alike. On a lesser scale, R. M. Bucke helped to lay the
groundwork for future developments by popularizing the concept of
&quot;cosmic consciousness.&quot; Bucke, a Canadian psychiatrist
and a contemporary of James, wrote in 1901: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The prime characteristic of cosmic consciousness is a
    consciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the life and order
    of the universe. Along with the consciousness of the cosmos
    there occurs an intellectual enlightenment which alone would
    place the individual on a new plane of existence&#151; would
    make him almost a member of a new species. To this is added a
    state of moral exaltation, an indescribable feeling of
    elevation, elation, and joyousness, and a quickening of the
    moral sense, which is fully as striking, and more important
    than is the enhanced intellectual power. With these come what
    may be called a sense of immortality, a consciousness of
    eternal life, not a conviction that he shall have this, but
    the consciousness that he has it already. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bucke might easily have been describing the
deep-seated conviction of a psychedelic cultist&#151;and in fact
some of the cultists have begun now to speak of themselves as a
new species: as the forerunners of an emerging race of psychic
mutants who will transcend the world to attain the nirvana of
pure Being. Even at the time Bucke wrote, experimentation was
beginning with various psychedelic agents then available. As
mentioned, James himself was exploring the implications of
nitrous oxide intoxication. Havelock Ellis had been dabbling with
mescaline. And during the latter part of the nineteenth century,
American Indian tribes had begun to use peyote as a sacrament in
their religious ceremonies, leading finally to the establishment
of the psychedelic Native American Church, which now has an
estimated quarter-million members. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The new century saw a proliferation of cults,
sects, and societies whose teachings often were a combination of
mumbo jumbo and Eastern philosophy (for example, the I AM
movement). Some of the issues at stake were translated to the
secular and political level; the conflict between monism and
pluralism reappeared in the antagonism between democratic
individualism and the anthill conformity of fascism and
communism: even the Rotary Club orator fulminating against
creeping socialism and the Washington octopus was in a very real
sense addressing himself to one of the most basic problems of
metaphysics and East-West theology: the Many versus the One. As
far as the laying of a groundwork is concerned, significance must
also be attached to the new respectability which parapsychology
gained as a result of the studies inaugurated at Duke University
in 1930 by J. B. Rhine. The painstaking research devoted to such
phenomena as extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis would
lend its scientific aura to the astonishing statements which
would later be made by the prophets of the drug movement, making
those statements sound not quite so astonishing to an empirically
minded generation. Indeed, it is possible that the Duke research
has a direct bearing on the validity of psychedelic experience.
As the ultra-cautious Rhine explained in 1947: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The research in parapsychology even now touches other
    great issues of religion. If the mind of man is nonphysical,
    it is possible to formulate a hypothetical picture of a
    nonphysical system or world made up of all such minds
    existing in some sort of relationship to each other. This
    leads to speculative views of a kind of psychical oversoul,
    or reservoir, or continuum, or universe, having its own
    system of laws and properties and potentialities. One can
    conceive of this great total pattern as having a transcendent
    uniqueness over and above the nature of its parts that some
    might call its divinity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eastern themes were everywhere. Even the schoolgirl
was not immune as she turned the treasured pages of Kahlil
Gibran's <i>The Prophet</i>. &quot;Fare you well, people of
Orphalese,&quot; said that chosen and beloved one, Almustafa.
&quot;A little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam
for another body. A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind,
and another woman shall bear me.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The floodgates were opened by the outcome of the
Second World War, of course, and one does well to remember that
Zen was &quot;camp&quot; long before LSD. Buddhist study groups
sprang up. American pupils and housewives could be found writing
haiku poetry in grade-school classrooms and on the backs of
grocery shopping lists. Bookstore racks gave prominent display to
paperback editions of the <i>Upanishads</i>, the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i>,
the <i>Tao Te Ching.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These developments perhaps were inevitable;
nevertheless, it seems fair to say that the Eastern influx could
not have attained its present magnitude had it not been for the
conscious and dedicated efforts of five men: Carl Jung, Daisetz
T. Suzuki, Alan W. Watts, W. Y. Evans-Wentz, and Aldous Huxley.
Jung's concept of the collective unconscious has Oriental
connotations, and Jung in addition had an abiding interest in
Eastern metaphysics: he lent the authority of his name to works
on Zen and related subjects, writing forewords and commentaries
which expressed his enthusiasm, and he once affirmed that the <i>Tibetan
Book of the Dead</i> had been a &quot;constant companion&quot; to
which he owed &quot;not only many stimulating ideas and
discoveries, but also many fundamental insights.&quot; Suzuki, a
Japanese scholar who died only recently in Tokyo, wrote literally
scores of books in which he sought to interpret Zen for Western
readers, and he also lectured widely in American universities.
Watts complemented Suzuki by examining Zen through Western eyes;
a gifted interpreter and popularizer of complex ideas, he has
made Eastern wisdom comprehensible to a vast audience through
books, lectures, and television classes. Evans-Wentz introduced
the West to the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, a remarkable
book which deserves our attention if only for the fact that it
has since been adopted as the bible of the drug movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&quot;It is a book which is sealed with the
seven seals of silence,&quot;</i> we are told in a foreword by
Lama Anagarika Govinda. <i>&quot;But the time has come to break
the seals of silence . . .&quot;</i> And why? Because &quot;the
human race has come to the juncture where it must decide whether
to be content with the subjugation of the material world, or to
strive after the conquest of the spiritual world.&quot; The
origins of the book go back at least a thousand years. In the
original Tibetan the work is known as the <i>Bardo Thödol,</i>
which means &quot;Liberation by Hearing on the After-Death
Plane,&quot; and the exoteric purpose of the book was
emancipation from the reincarnational wheel of death and rebirth.
The book was read over the bodies of the recently deceased by
those Sages of the Snowy Ranges, the Buddhist lamas of Tibet, and
the idea was to talk a dead person out of seeking reincarnation
in a new body. A dead man was believed to wander in the Bardo or
After-Death Plane for forty-nine days (a symbolic number based on
seven times seven), and during this period&#151;in fact at the
moment of death&#151;he would encounter the Clear Light of the
Void. If he had the understanding which comes with good karma, he
would surrender his sense of individuality and would merge with
that Void, thus ending the matter then and there. But the Void is
terrible to behold if you lack understanding, and many
reincarnations are normally required before one earns one's
karmic passport to nirvana. And so it was that most dead men
would turn in terror from the Clear Light. They would wander in
the Bardo, their senses assaulted by visions both frightful and
beatific&#151;by the Wrathful Deities and the Peaceful
Deities&#151;and finally they would enter the womb to be born
again. In hopes of preventing this, the lamas would therefore
read aloud from the sacred book, a sort of Fielding's guide to
the Bardo region, and the dead men would thus receive detailed
instructions for every stage of their journey. They would be told
that their fear of the Clear Light resulted from their false
sense of self, whose existence the Clear Light quite correctly
appeared to threaten. They would be told that the visions they
saw, apart from the Void, were nothing more than
sangsara&#151;projections of their own minds, which were still
caught in the Net of Illusion. And finally they would be told
that the womb was simply a doorway back to the world of
appearances. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That was the exoteric teaching; but when
Evans-Wentz first presented the book to the West, in 1927, the
suggestion was made that it included or concealed an esoteric
interpretation. Jung, for example, contributed a psychological
commentary in which he asserted that &quot;it is an undeniable
fact that the whole book is created out of the archetypal
contents of the unconscious.&quot; More to the point, Lama
Govinda stated in his foreword that the book &quot;was originally
conceived to serve as a guide not only for the dying and the
dead, but for the living as well.&quot; And that in any case is
what it has since become, whatever the original intention might
have been. More than a quarter-century after its initial
publication, the Evans-Wentz edition came to prominence again in
1954, when Huxley made much of it in his very influential book, <i>The
Doors of Perception</i>. In that book Huxley wrote of his first
experience with mescaline, which he took in his home in
California in the spring of 1953. Huxley reported that at one
point he felt himself on the verge of panic, terrified by the
prospect of ego disintegration, and he compared his dread with
that of the Tibetan dead man who could not face the Clear Light,
preferring rebirth and &quot;the comforting darkness of
selfhood.&quot; Thus the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> was
inexorably linked to the psychedelic experience, and ten years
later, in 1964, there appeared a volume titled <i>The Psychedelic
Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>.
The authors were LSD enthusiasts Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner,
and Richard Alpert, and they boldly offered their own
interpretation of the ancient book: it had to do not with the
death and rebirth of the <i>body</i> but rather with the death
and rebirth of the <i>ego</i> in mystical states of mind. It was
indeed a book for the living. More than that, it provided, in
symbolic imagery, a precise account of the psychedelic
experience. Absorption in the Clear Light is nothing more than a
good trip, in which the psychedelic subject feels himself united
again with the Ground of his Being. It is the apprehension of
pure Being, beyond the sangsaric deceptions of language and
rational perception. And those Peaceful and Wrathful Deities
represent the hallucinatory period which occurs when one fails to
achieve the central experience. A bad trip results inevitably
when the subject refuses to face the Clear Light&#151;violently
resists the disintegration of his ego&#151;and rather than seek
rebirth in another body, he pleads for a shot of Thorazine which
will return him to his own body in the phenomenal world of ego
and rational symbolism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Huxley's book has a certain historical
significance; what we refer to today as the drug movement may be
said to date from that book, although, as we have attempted to
show, a substantial base for the movement had been in preparation
long before 1954. In any case, the drug movement appeared to
dovetail very neatly with what might be called the Eastern
movement, and it might well be asked if this occurred naturally
or under duress; that is, did the two really fit together, or
were they made to fit? The latter possibility has been suggested
by R. E. L. Masters and Jean Houston, who cite as evidence the
phenomenon they refer to as &quot;galloping agape.&quot; They
assert that the supposed capacity of the psychedelics to promote
feelings of brotherly love was rarely detected during early
research in the 1950's: it became manifest only with the
appearance of love-oriented drug literature. By the same token,
Huxley and other drug enthusiasts are accused of leading their
readers down the lotus path. Masters and Houston criticize the
emergence of a &quot;quasi-Eastern mystique,&quot; of a
&quot;wholesale leap to the East&quot; and a &quot;nebulous chaos
seen as Eastern 'truth.' &quot; These developments are all the
more regrettable since the psychedelic drugs &quot;may genuinely
give some inkling of the complexity of Eastern
consciousness.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Masters and Houston conclude: &quot;To at least
some extent the responsibility for this seduction of the innocent
must lie with such authors as Huxley, Alan Watts, and others who
in their various writings imposed upon the psychedelic experience
essentially Eastern ideas and terminology which a great many
persons then assumed to be the sole and accurate way of
approaching and interpreting such experience.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The charge is serious, if it holds up in court.
