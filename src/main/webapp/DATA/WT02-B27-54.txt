This Web site is concerned with the nature of <A HREF=":TFL/Teach">effective teaching</A>.  Its overall goal is to provide a source of information relevant to this topic and to encourage thinking about practical, theoretical, and research issues related to effective teaching.  The site was developed as a class project by <A HREF="http:TFL/Students">students</A> in a graduate seminar on <A HREF="http:CEP572/CEP572">Research on Teaching (CEP 572)</A> at the State University of New York at Buffalo during Fall 1996.  The students' analyses and critiques of selected topics related to the site's theme are included, as are links to other Web sites and print resources that are relevant to this theme.<BR>
