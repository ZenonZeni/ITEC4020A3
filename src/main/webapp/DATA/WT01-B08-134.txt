<H1>About Soil Amendments</H1>
<BR>
<P>Organic matter is the very heart and soul of organic gardening.  Organic matter is the waste residues and remains of living organisms.  As it undergoes the natural process of decay in the soil, it is converted gradually to a very stable form called humus.  Ultimately humus and the process by which it is formed can have a dramatic impact on your garden.  An adequate supply of humus in a garden will:</P>

<LI>Improve aeration in the soil and enhance its ability to absorb and retain water readily

<LI>Improve the soil's ability to retain and release nutrients

<LI>Provide a source of nutrients to plants

<LI>Serve as a food source for soil microbes, thereby improving the soil's biological activity

<P>There are few things as important in garden preparation as adding organic matter to the soil.  Yet, many gardeners have gotten away from adding organic matter to the soil and instead have relied on synthetic fertilizers.  While synthetic fertilizers can provide the raw elements necessary for plant growth, they can not replace organic matter lost through the mismanagement of soils.  In time, more fertilizer is needed to compensate for degeneration of organic matter in the soil.</P>

<P>At <B>Whitney Farms</B> we have worked hard to develop a line of soil amendments that provides a quality compost for the home gardener.  All of our manures and amendments are composted for a minimum of one year.  They aren't just stacked in a big pile and left to sit; they are turned regularly with compostturning machinery to ensure proper breakdown.  Throughout the process we maintain temperatures close to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for optimum breakdown.

<P>By composting, we ensure that the finished product is a material rich humus that will contribute to a garden's success.  Our amendments and composts won't rob nutrients like an unfinished compost or wood byproducts will.  <B>Whitney Farms</B> amendments add life to a garden.</P>

<P>It is important that compost or other organic matter be added to a garden every year to keep the soil alive.  We suggest that 2 inches be added and tilled in to a minimum of 6 inches before spring planting.  For stubborn soils, add organic matter again in the fall as a mulch for the first few years of a garden.</P>
