This research area is supported by the following laboratories: Engineering Mechanics and Design (Prof. S.A. Meguid), 
Applied Surface Thermodynamics (Prof. A.W. Neumann), Ultrasonic Non-destructive Evaluation (Prof. A.N. Sinclair) and 
Thermodynamics and Kinetics (Prof. C.A. Ward).<p>

Coatings for surface protection against wear, oxidation 
and corrosion as well as for the introduction of favorable 
surface properties such as thermal barrier, electrical 
insulation and improved resistance to frettage: Use of 
novel ultrasonic techniques, such as the Leaky lamb or 
Rayleigh waves, to characterize coatings nondestructively.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/neumann.html"> <b> Professor A.W. Neumann </b></a>
<br>
Generalization of the classical theory of capillarity to high 
curvature situations. Non-classical continuum approaches 
to interfacial tension problems. Development of 
techniques to determine surface tension and wettability 
of small particles. Application of Digital Image Analysis 
and Digital Image Processing to interfacial tension and 
other surface science problems. Studies of electrostatic 
and electrokinetic phenomena connected with colloidal 
structure and stability. Thermodynamic aspects of 
adhesion.  <p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/sinclair.html"> <b> Professor A.N. Sinclair </b></a>
<br>
The nondestructive characterization of interfacial 
profiles: Use of ultrasound to evaluate the extent of 
interdiffusion at the interface, and characterize any 
inhomogeneities; and, use of surface acoustic microscopy 
to determine depth profiles of interfacial layers, with 
particular application to adhesive bonds.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/spelt.html"> <b> Professor J.K. Spelt </b></a>
<br>
Study of the dynamics of adhesive wetting, as the crucial 
first step in bond formation. Also of interest are the 
environmental stability of the adhesive-substrate 
interfacial region, the role of surface roughness in bond 
performance, and the thermodynamic interpretation of 
adhesion.<p>

A new theory of kinetics is being developed to predict 
the rate of mass transfer between phases in terms of 
material properties of the system. To examine the 
theoretical developments, the theory is being applied to 
examine adsorption kinetics and temperature-
programmed-desorption of gases from single crystal 
metal surfaces. A thermodynamic analysis is being used 
to predict the configuration that two phase fluid systems 
adopt when free of gravitational influences. The 
theoretical predictions are being examined using the 
Japanese dropshaft and the Space Shuttle.  <p>
