ACCIDENTAL HYPOTHERMIA: WHEN THERMOREGULATION IS OVERWHELMED

By:
Teofilo L. Lee-Chiong Jr, MDJohn T. Stitt, PhD

Preview
   The homeless, the elderly, infants, military personnel on duty, and even
persons living in subtropical climes may fall prey to the effects of
hypothermia. Most cold-related injuries and fatalities are due to
accidental exposure, ingestion of alcohol and other intoxicants,
hypoglycemia, trauma, or chronic debilitating illness. The authors explain
the effects of heat loss on body systems and discuss how to reverse the
process and achieve rapid rewarming.

   Like other homeothermic animals, humans are able to maintain their body
temperature within narrow limits regardless of normal changes in
environmental conditions. Nonetheless, hypothermia, which is defined as
body core temperature below 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), can develop
whenever this remarkable thermoregulatory apparatus is overwhelmed by
excessive heat loss, inadequate heat production, or impairment of
function.

Epidemiology
   Over 9,300 deaths from hypothermia were reported in the United States
between 1979 and 1990.1 (Reference) Most cases occur in urban areas, and
the elderly, the indigent, and the homeless are often affected. For
example, one half of cold-related fatalities in the District of Columbia
between 1972 and 1982 occurred in persons with inadequate housing.2
(Reference) The highest number of deaths from hypothermia occurred not only
in states with severe winters, such as Illinois, New York, and
Pennsylvania, but also in states with milder weather, such as North and
South Carolina and Virginia.3 (Reference) The incidence of hypothermia is
equally alarming in other countries. In a Danish hospital from 1975 to
1989, hypothermia was documented in nearly 5% of patients admitted to the
intensive care unit.4 (Reference)
   Cold-related deaths and injuries are also often reported in combatants
during military campaigns and in participants in outdoor winter sports.
About 91,000 cases of cold injury were reported among US soldiers in Europe
during World War II.5 (Reference)
   Hypothermia may develop in persons exposed to a modestly cool climate
for prolonged periods. The condition has even been reported in tropical
climates where average daily temperatures do not fall below 16 degrees C
(60.8 degrees F).6 (Reference) However, most cases of ``tropical''
hypothermia have involved patients with severe undernutrition or
malnutrition.

Predisposing factors
   The principal predisposing factors in cases of hypothermia are
accidental cold exposure, immersion in water, extremes of age, trauma, drug
ingestion, poisoning, and chronic illness. Hypothermia due to accidental
cold exposure is encountered most commonly among neonates and the elderly,
in those immobilized by trauma or exhaustion, and in intoxicated and
unconscious persons.

   Extremes of age--In neo-nates, large surface area relative to body mass,
lack of subcutaneous fatty tissue, rudimentary adaptive behavior, and
ineffective shivering all contribute to inability to defend against extreme
environmental conditions. In the elderly, altered thermal perception,
deteriorating adaptive responses, low body-fat content, autonomic
dysfunction, maintenance on medications, impaired vasoconstrictive ability,
and low metabolic capacity are common factors that contribute to
hypothermia.
   Trauma--Exposure to cold at the scene of an accident, during lengthy
surgery, or as a result of inadvertent transfusion of large amounts of
unwarmed crystalloid solutions and chilled blood components increases the
risk for hypothermia in trauma patients. Furthermore, heat production from
shivering is inhibited by anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agents.
Abnormal peripheral vasodilatation and dermal damage produced by surface
burns may produce large, unchecked heat losses from the body surface.
   Drug ingestion and poisoning--The possibility of recreational and
therapeutic drug ingestion must be considered in any unexplained case of
hypothermia. Depending on the population surveyed, consumption of ethanol
is associated with up to 80% of hypothermia cases.7 (Reference)
Phenothiazines may produce hypothermia through a hypothalamic depressant
action and an inhibitory effect on shivering. Drug overdoses and poisonings
can disrupt normal heat production and conservation by impairing perception
of changes in ambient temperature (which may result in inappropriate and
often paradoxical behavioral responses) and depressing the mental status.
   Chronic illness--Antecedent chronic debilitating illnesses, such as
severe hypothyroidism, hypothalamic tumors, overwhelming infections, severe
strokes, and malnutrition, not only exacerbate hypothermic injuries but
also decrease the victim's capacity to counter hypothermia once it has
developed.

Manifestations
   During early, mild hypothermia, the body attempts to compensate for its
falling temperature by intensifying thermogenesis through shivering and
hypermetabolism. A generalized increase in heat production by the
musculature surrounding the torso is associated with shivering. In the
extremities, shivering is less pronounced or absent. Accompanying the
increase in metabolism are (1) elevations in respiratory rate, minute
ventilation, and oxygen consumption, (2) increases in heart rate, cardiac
output, and mean arterial pressure, and (3) elevated levels of serum
cortisol, lactate, glycerol, ketones, and glucose; all of these result in
increased heat production. Acrocyanosis and cool skin reflect the intense
peripheral vasoconstriction that helps sustain core temperature by shunting
blood away from the cold body surface.
   Thermoregulatory failure--Thermoregulation eventually fails when peak
heat production is unable to offset the rate of heat loss from the body
surface; further reductions in core temperature occur, eventually leading
to progressive multiorgan dysfunction (table 1). Because of reductions in
cerebral blood flow, patients may become uncooperative and uncoordinated
and may even manifest irrational behavior, such as undressing. Confusion
and stupor emerge at temperatures between 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C
(89.6 degrees F and 95 degrees F). Most patients are comatose at 27 degrees
C (80.6 degrees F).
   Pulmonary and renal effects--Depression of the central respiratory
center can cause both tidal volumes and respiratory rates to decline.
Cold-induced vasoconstriction increases central blood volume; this increase
promotes withdrawal of antidiuretic hormone, which leads to the familiar
cold-induced diuresis. Furthermore, in cases of hypothermia, cold-related
impairment of renal enzymatic activity can inhibit active tubular
reabsorption, resulting in marked excretion of extremely dilute urine,
which, in turn, may further compound preexisting hypovolemia and
hemoconcentration. Renal failure secondary to depressed renal blood flow
and defective tubular activity often develops in patients who have
prolonged and profound hypothermia.
   Gastrointestinal effects--Diminished intestinal motility is commonly
observed at core temperatures below 34 degrees C (93.2 degrees F), and
ileus is invariably present once body temperature falls below 30 degrees C
(86 degrees F). In addition, acute punctate erosions of the stomach and
duodenum, hepatic dysfunction, and pancreatitis may develop as a result of
hypoperfusion.
   Cardiovascular effects--Cardiac output and mean arterial pressure fall
as a result of bradycardia, hypovolemia, and decreased ejection fraction.
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias often develop as hypothermia progresses.
Atrial fibrillation becomes common below 32 degrees C, and ventricular
fibrillation and asystole may occur if core temperature falls below 28
degrees C (82.4 degrees F) and 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), respectively.
When body temperature drops below 31 degrees C (87.8 degrees F), a
characteristic electrocardiographic change called the Osborne wave (J wave)
is seen; it manifests as a deflection at the QRS and ST junction and is
best visualized in leads II and V (subscript) 6.
   Reduced metabolic demands--The widespread physiologic derangements of
hypothermia would be immediately fatal were it not for the concomitant
reduction in metabolic demands caused by body cooling. Vasoconstriction and
hemoconcentration ensure acceptable arterial pressures in spite of reduced
cardiac indexes. As a result of reduced metabolic requirements, even the
progressively falling respiratory minute ventilation remains adequate to
meet the demands of oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide elimination. Oxygen
consumption falls by 25% at a core temperature of 31 degrees C and by 75%
at a core temperature of 20 degrees C. Depression of cerebral metabolism
enables the brain to tolerate most hypothermic insults, and complete
recovery of neurologic functions has been reported despite prolonged
cardiac arrest and resuscitation.8 (Reference)

Treatment
   One of the most difficult tasks confronting physicians who treat
patients with hypothermia is accurate determination of death. Rigor mortis,
dependent lividity, and fixed, dilated pupils--all of which are commonly
associated with death in normothermic individuals--become unreliable
indicators in the presence of hypothermia. Therefore, resuscitative
measures must be terminated only when cardiac arrest persists despite
rewarming.
   Preventing further heat loss--It is imperative that further heat loss be
halted by moving patients to a warmer environment. They must be kept dry
and insulated. Hot drinks and particularly alcohol are best avoided because
they can magnify ongoing heat loss by promoting inappropriate peripheral
vasodilatation.
   Laboratory studies--Laboratory values obtained at presentation not only
serve as a useful baseline for future determinations but also may
facilitate early recognition of emerging complications. In addition to
blood counts, serum chemistry values, and coagulation parameters, it is
advisable to obtain a thyroid panel, measurements of serum cortisol and
cardiac isoenzymes, and surveillance cultures and chest radiographs. Blood
glucose levels are notoriously unpredictable and must be closely monitored,
especially in cases of hypoglycemia, which may impede rewarming if left
uncorrected. Films of the cervical spine are essential whenever coexisting
head and neck trauma is a possibility. Repeated abdominal and pelvic
radiographs and determinations of serum amylase and lipase levels may be
necessary to monitor pancreatic and intestinal injuries.
   While awaiting results of toxicologic studies, physicians may consider
empirical administration of naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) and thiamine
hydrochloride (Biamine) in patients who are known to have a history of
illicit drug and alcohol abuse. Levothyroxine sodium is indicated only for
hypothermic myxedema and methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Solu-Medrol) only
for adrenocortical insufficiency.
   Cardiac monitoring--This is essential for assessment of arrhythmias.
Faint peripheral pulses can be extremely difficult to appreciate because of
bradycardia and intense vasoconstriction. Atrial arrhythmias and heart
blocks are usually transient phenomena that convert spontaneously with
rewarming. Bretylium tosylate (Bretylol) is the drug of choice for
ventricular fibrillation and appears to be more efficacious than lidocaine
hydrochloride (Xylocaine). Bradyarrhythmias may require temporary pacing.
Aggressive rewarming is mandatory with arrest rhythms, because
pharmacologic and electrical cardioversions are invariably unsuccessful
when body temperature is below 30 degrees C. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
must be continued until the victim's core temperature has reached 32
degrees C to 35 degrees C.
   Maintenance of intravascular volume--Adequate intravascular volume needs
to be supported. Early initiation of intravenous access facilitates
parenteral administration of pharmacologic agents as well as infusion of
crystalloid solutions and various blood components. In the presence of
frostbitten extremities, central venous access may be preferable to
peripheral catheters. Furthermore, central venous lines allow large-volume
infusions, which may not be possible peripherally with cold-induced
vascular constriction; central lines also permit monitoring of central
venous pressure during fluid replenishment.
   Because the hypothermic myocardium is intensely irritable, the tip of a
central catheter must be located at a reasonable distance from the heart to
prevent induction of arrhythmias. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring using
pulmonary catheters may precipitate fatal arrhythmias.
   Preferably, 5% dextrose in normal saline solution should be heated to 40
degrees C to 42 degrees C (104 degrees F to 107.6 degrees F) before
administration. Lactated Ringer's solution is best avoided because the
liver's capacity to metabolize lactate to bicarbonate is often inhibited by
hypothermia. Low doses of dopamine hydrochloride (Dopastat, Intropin) may
be required if hypotension persists despite seemingly adequate fluid
repletion. Because of their inherent arrhythmogenic capacity, levarterenol
(Levophed), epinephrine, and isoproterenol hydrochloride (Isuprel) are
rarely, if ever, indicated. Hourly urinary output should be monitored by
using indwelling bladder catheters.
   Airway control--Satisfactory airway control must be guaranteed.
Administration of warm, humidified oxygen by face mask suffices for most
cases of mild hypothermia. Endotracheal intubation is primarily indicated
during respiratory arrest and whenever adequate protection of the airways
is questionable. Control of secretions is particularly troublesome in
persons with moderate to severe hypothermia, because profuse bronchorrhea
and ineffective mucociliary activity may contribute to airway obstruction.
   Infection--This ever-present hazard requires diagnostic vigilance and
vigorous therapy. Infection is easily missed because fever is often absent
and laboratory findings are invariably nonspecific. At times, an
unexplained fall in systemic vascular resistance is the sole clue to
evolving sepsis. Use of prophylactic antibiotics is indicated in neonates
and infants and also in diabetic adults, in whom the prognosis with sepsis
is particularly ominous.
   Thromboembolism--Hypothermic patients may be prone to thromboembolism
because of cold-related intravascular volume depletion and increased blood
viscosity. Unfortunately, traditional measures are often unsatisfactory in
preventing this complication. Cutaneous hypoperfusion renders the
absorption of subcutaneously administered heparin highly erratic.
Application of pneumatic boots may further compromise frostbitten
extremities.
   Dermal injury--Dermal injury from frostbite typically affects the
extremities, face, ears, penis, and scrotum. Initially gray and waxy, the
involved areas usually become swollen and blistered and may turn red to
black with rewarming. Frostbitten dermis may be thawed by bathing in water
that has been warmed to 38 degrees C to 40 degrees C (100.4 degrees F to
104 degrees F). Parenteral heparin has been used to salvage injured
tissues. Surgical excision and amputation must be deferred until definite
demarcation of nonviable dermis becomes apparent during the second week
after injury.

Methods of rewarming
   Rewarming should be achieved rapidly at the most hemodynamically
tolerable rate possible with use of the least invasive means (table 2). A
particular rewarming method, whether passive or active, is selected after
thorough consideration of the patient's age and overall health, the
presence of any concurrent complications, the severity and duration of the
hypothermic insult, and the effectiveness and degree of invasiveness of
available techniques.
   Passive external rewarming--This is the least invasive method of
rewarming and is generally sufficient for patients with core temperatures
above 33 degrees C (91.4 degrees F). Minimizing further heat dissipation by
removing the patient from the cold environment and providing shelter and
insulation is often all that is necessary for acute, mild hypothermia when
endogenous heat production through shivering restores body temperature to
acceptable levels. With this method, temperature can increase by 0.4 degree
C to 2 degrees C (0.7 degree F to 3.6 degrees F) each hour. Peripheral
vasoconstriction is maintained; this minimizes the risk of both hypotension
and temperature afterdrops, which often occur when cold peripheral blood is
shunted to the core during vasodilatation.
   Active rewarming--This method is indicated for patients with moderate to
severe hypothermia and core temperatures below 32 degrees C. It may also be
preferable in the elderly and in patients with hypoglycemia,
hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, or other disorders
that limit endogenous thermogenesis. Persons with diabetic ketoacidosis and
cardiovascular instability may benefit from the rapid normalization of core
body temperature that is possible only with active rewarming. Finally,
active rewarming must be considered in any patient, whatever the degree of
hypothermia, if initial passive rewarming methods fail to elevate body
temperature.
   Active external rewarming--This may be accomplished with hot water
bottles, heated blankets, external radiant sources, or warm bath
immersions.9-11 (Reference) These approaches are highly effective in
elevating body temperature but do have several drawbacks. In addition to
dangerous surface burns, which may occur if the temperature of the thermal
appliance is not closely monitored, afterdrops of core temperature may
develop because these methods tend to induce early peripheral
vasodilatation. Hemodynamic instability may ensue if the hypothermic heart
is unable to respond adequately to the rising metabolic requirements of the
rewarmed exterior tissue shell. The risk of circulatory collapse is
determined primarily by the patient's degree of cardiovascular tolerance,
the extent of exposed body surface, and the intensity of rewarming.
   Active core rewarming--This provides the most rapid return to
normothermia and is the method of choice in patients who have cardiac
arrest or ventricular fibrillation. Airway rewarming is done with warmed,
humidified gas, and rewarming rates between 1 degree C and 2.5 degrees C
(1.8 degrees F and 4.5 degrees F) an hour can be achieved. This method has
the added benefits of (1) preferential rewarming of central blood volume
and the heart and lungs and (2) stimulation of the airway mucociliary
apparatus. Inhaled gas temperatures should be maintained between 40 degrees
C and 45 degrees C (104 degrees F and 113 degrees F) by using an in-line
temperature monitor to prevent tracheobronchial injuries and parenchymal
edema, which may occur if gas temperatures exceed 46 degrees C (114.8
degrees F).
   Lavage of the gastrointestinal tract can be done with warmed solutions.
However, the effectiveness of intragastric irrigation is limited by the
small surface area of the stomach, and fluid and electrolyte shifts may
complicate intracolonic irrigation. Lavage is contraindicated in persons
with suspected intra-abdominal trauma and in those who have had recent
gastrointestinal surgery.
   Pleural irrigation is performed either through thoracostomy tubes or
with open thoracotomy. Circulating warm saline solution can also be
introduced into the mediastinum through chest tubes. Similarly, peritoneal
lavage with prewarmed dialysate can be accomplished by peritoneal dialysis
or by direct irrigation of the open peritoneal cavity if hypothermia
develops as a complication of abdominal surgery. Peritoneal dialysis is
contraindicated in patients with abdominal injuries and is preferably
avoided in those who have had previous operations, because they may be more
prone to intraperitoneal injury and infection from preexisting adhesions.
Like intracolonic lavage, peritoneal dialysis may promote detoxification of
ingested drugs and poisons by rewarming the liver and reactivating hepatic
enzymes.
   Extracorporeal rewarming of blood by cardiopulmonary bypass or
hemodialysis should be considered for severely hypothermic patients with
core temperatures below 28 degrees C. Blood circulation can be preserved by
using cardiopulmonary bypass even in the absence of effective myocardial
activity. The rate of rewarming averages 9.5 degrees C (17.1 degrees F) an
hour during cardiopulmonary bypass.12 (Reference)

Prognosis
   Survival is inversely related to the intensity and duration of
hypothermia. Outcome is better in cases resulting from simple exposure or
ingestion of ethanol. Significant antecedent illness, cardiac arrest before
hospitalization, hypotension, coma, respiratory failure, and intravascular
thrombosis indicate a worse prognosis.

Summary
   The diagnosis of hypothermia must be entertained when patients present
with unexplained mental status changes or arrhythmias. Prompt recognition
and aggressive treatment of complications should reduce cold-related
fatalities. The choice of an appropriate rewarming method must be
individualized and depends on the severity of hypothermia and the patient's
degree of hemodynamic tolerance.

   The cost of medicine. We hear about it constantly, usually in connection
with terms such as ``skyrocketing,'' ``spiraling,'' and ``out of control.''
But at a 25-year reunion of a family practice residency program I attended
recently, the discussion centered on a different type of medical cost--the
personal cost of being a primary care physician.
   A large group of current faculty and residents, as well as returning
graduates, spent a Saturday morning listening to a panel discussion and
then, in smaller groups, sharing some of their own stories. These
physicians, from rural solo practices, urban multispecialty group
practices, and everything in between, talked not only of their great
satisfaction in sharing in the personal and family events in the lives of
their patients, but also of the loneliness in dealing with medical crises
and other problems faced by patients they had come to know as friends. Most
of them spoke of a lack of emotional support from the community and,
unfortunately, a lack of overt support from colleagues when they were
dealing with a poor patient outcome, a malpractice suit, or personal
problems.

Key rewards
   I'd like to believe that physicians in primary care medicine have some
personal values that enable us to reach out to patients and that these very
connections, in turn, reward us. There is an important difference between
being a doctor and being a personal doctor, one who is willing to make a
commitment of person to the patients he or she serves. This commitment is
what allows us to turn a case into a patient and a number into a name--of a
real person in a real family in a real community. It gives our medical
encounters depth, but it also puts us at some emotional risk.
   The relationships we develop with patients are the key rewards in our
practice. They are what keeps us coming back for more. Often we have the
privilege of caring for a patient through many years or even through the
patient's life span. The flip side, though, is the emotional burden of
foreseeing the medical problems that lie ahead for a patient. The joys of
the doctor-patient relationship are tempered when a patient is dying or
when we feel we or the medical community could have done something better.

Punishing ourselves
   When a patient's outcome is poor, we punish ourselves by second-guessing
our decisions. But when a result is less than optimum, perhaps no one is to
blame. As Rabbi H. Kushner says in his well-known book, bad things do
happen to good people. We may be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Despite our competence and conscientious surveillance, some patients may
experience side effects of medications or procedures. As financial
considerations become more important in medical care, managed care
guidelines or policies may distort our particular style of medical
practice. We may pay too much attention to cost containment, thus
increasing the potential for a poor outcome.
   Instead of personalizing poor results and internalizing the discomfort,
we need to remind ourselves that the situation may have been beyond our
control. One long-time physician in my discussion group shared the pain of
not diagnosing a carcinoma until it became metastatic in a patient who had
just recently come in for an annual exam. The physician felt personally
responsible for that patient's cancer and had grieved silently for years.
Unfortunately, his family, his friends, and even his other patients also
suffered because of his unresolved grief, damaged self-esteem, and mild
depression.
   Such self-doubts can get way out of hand: According to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, physicians are No. 3 out of
230 occupations analyzed for risk of suicide, with an odds ratio of 2.88
compared with the general public. Only psychologists and pharmacists rank
higher, and lawyers hold the fifth spot.
   A poor outcome is not necessarily the same as a mistake. As Mark Twain
is quoted as saying, ``Good judgment comes from experience, and experience
comes from poor judgment.'' Reviewing events retrospectively, with all the
advantages of hindsight, can be healthy. But it is easy to focus on a
particular outcome and to forget about the confusion and complexities that
surrounded the case in context. We are accountable for what we try to do,
but not for everything that happens.

Sharing our feelings
   We also need to remember that we cannot protect ourselves or others from
the personal pain of living. Sometimes all we can do is try to ease
someone's pain. But because we feel we need to be strong, we tend not to
show our feelings. And when bad things happen, we blame ourselves too
easily. We might feel such guilt that we dread seeing a patient or won't
even call the patient's family. The point is, it's okay to say ``I'm
sorry.'' It's not an admission of guilt. And by sharing your feelings with
your patients and their families, you become a personal doctor.
   Like everyone else, physicians have to deal with personal
problems--family illnesses and deaths, financial concerns, chemical
dependency, divorce, disabilities, and the whole range of human frailty.
Physicians who are struggling with such problems need tremendous support.
The stress of silence can be almost unbearable, and not talking about our
feelings contributes to a sense of isolation and hopelessness. Doctors are
usually better at analyzing and evaluating facts, function, and form than
at dealing with their own frustrations and feelings and their need to
forgive and to be forgiven.

A listening ear
   The physicians at the reunion shared their difficulty in coping with
their personal pain within their practice setting. In one case, the least
likely colleague initiated a healing discussion, while a best-friend
physician would not or could not discuss the topic with the distressed
physician. It's almost as if some physicians cannot talk about painful
issues. Perhaps they think that the emotional feelings surrounding poor
outcomes, malpractice cases, and personal pain are contagious. But, at
least in the case of problems related to practice, support from colleagues
who not only can understand the confidential nature of a poor outcome or
the legal implications of a malpractice threat, but also can identify with
our vulnerability, is invaluable. We need our colleagues, with common
experience, to become trusted listeners.
   Support can also come from other sources. One doctor in the discussion
group said that a unique, long-time patient-friend turned out to be his
greatest source of support time and again. The important thing is to find a
nonjudgmental listener who, by hearing and reflecting on our story, can
help us understand our experience better. Sometimes all a patient needs is
for us to listen. At times, a good listener may be all that we need too.

Reaching out for help
   So who heals the healer? How do we talk, and how do we find trusted
listeners? How do we deal with our burdens?
   Look to your colleagues and friends. And perhaps consider a group, but
don't call it a support group. Instead, call it a professional development
group, or a case study seminar, or a journal club, and devote the last part
of the discussion time to patient and personal issues. The group could be a
model of the now-classic Balint seminar, where one confronts oneself by
discussing case-centered, patient-centered issues. What often happens in
such discussions is that the ``doctor'' in the doctor-patient relationship
emerges as you talk about a patient's problems, and soon you are talking
about your own place in the relationship and your own needs as a doctor.
   If discussion groups aren't your cup of tea or if you are in an isolated
rural solo practice, consider e-mail with other physicians. You might find
that the distance adds a measure of safety and comfort when sharing
personal issues. But be careful of confidentiality issues when discussing
cases on e-mail. The point is, reach out for help. If you don't know where
to turn, call a trusted faculty member at your local residency program or
contact a medical school or your state or county medical society. If you
are in severe distress, consider professional therapy.
   Finally, don't forget to celebrate the everyday joys and successes of
practicing medicine. We have all helped patients through difficult times.
Let's start reminding each other of the successes we have had. And let's be
a constructive force in helping colleagues to cope during difficult times.
The need for help is not a sign of weakness. Don't let the burdens of
caring hide the rewards of practicing medicine.

What is the Balint method of training?
   Michael Balint was a psychiatrist who, with his wife Enid, conducted a
series of training seminars for general practitioners at the Tavistock
Clinic in London during the late 1950s and 1960s. He published the
monograph The Doctor, His Patient, and the Illness after several of his
groups had been meeting for at least 3 years.
   The design of the ``training cum research'' was extremely simple: Small
groups of family physicians met weekly to discuss their interactions with
patients that were in any way puzzling, frustrating, or unsatisfying.
Presentations were informal and spontaneous, and the groups dealt with the
cases over time to understand more about the doctor-patient relationship
and how it affected the quality and outcome of care.
   After Dr Balint taught in the United States in the late 1960s, his
training techniques were widely adopted, especially in family practice
training programs around the country. Today, the International Balint
Federation continues to adapt and use his methods. Information about the

TWO BY TWO

By:
Eric G. Anderson, MD

   I often see geriatric patients as Noah saw his passengers: two by two.
Many of my older patients bring their spouses with them to the office.
   Sometimes these couples make me laugh and brighten my day. I've learned,
however, to bite my lip on occasion and not to laugh too soon, because
sometimes the humor is inadvertent.
   This was the case with Mrs Angel,* who brought her husband in on a day
when he was being particularly difficult.
   ``Do you know why I married this man?'' she finally asked me.
   I shook my head cautiously.
   ``Because there were things about him that I knew would bother other
people that didn't bother me,'' she replied.
   I sometimes learn more from the couple than I would seeing each person
separately. But just as often in my interactions with pairs, I blow it.
   That's what happened with Mrs Teitelbaum,* a new patient who
unexpectedly volunteered that she had divorced her first husband. Her
current husband shrank back uncomfortably into one of my office chairs.
   ``Well, I'm sure Mr Teitelbaum is better looking,'' I said
encouragingly, smiling at the embarrassed man.
   ``No,'' she said, brushing some lint off her skirt. ``My first husband
was better looking.''
I blundered on. ``Yes, but I bet your mother prefers Mr Teitelbaum.''
   ``No. She prefers my second husband,'' she replied. ``He's my third.''
   Silence really is golden.
   Not so funny was my relationship with Mrs Freedman.* She insisted on
giving her husband's history, even though he was an intelligent retired
schoolteacher who was very much on the ball. She corrected any symptoms he
offered. It was hard, therefore, to get the patient's perspective--not an
uncommon problem when one spouse is dominant, yet a situation experienced
physicians learn to handle.
   I must have forgotten my experience, because at one point in the office
visit I said, probably in exasperation, ``Mrs Freedman, please let your
husband explain how he's feeling. Then we can see if you agree with what
he's said.''
   I caught a strange look on her face, a look I saw again later when I
made my only appearance in court to defend myself against a charge of
medical malpractice. The charge was preposterous and I won, but it took 3
years of my life and a lot of the joy out of practicing medicine.
   The malpractice charge surely sharpened my sensitivity to any patient's
spouse, but I still smile when I think about two situations in which I was
slow to tune in.
   Mrs Schlott* brought in her oversedated husband, who sat drooling in the
corner while she told me what had happened: She'd taken him to our urgent
care department, and a doctor there had diagnosed depression and prescribed
trazodone. The doctor hadn't mentioned the drug's side effects, though. Mrs
Schlott wondered if her husband's headache, nausea, and palpitations could
be related to the medication.
   I wasn't surprised by her questions. The husband, a deaf, irascible
person who never showed his wife affection, used various doctors for
primary care. She often asked me to sort out any confusion regarding his
treatment.
   I looked at the label and noted that a heavy loading dose had been
prescribed for a man his age. I thought I should warn him about the more
important side effects.
   I leaned over and shouted in his ear, dropping my voice when I came to
priapism, a complication I'd actually seen in a couple of patients. I
didn't want to embarrass his wife.
   ``What exactly are you saying, Doctor?'' she asked.
   ``The male might have an erection that could last for hours, Mrs
Schlott. It can be a problem if it doesn't go down,'' I said hesitatingly.
   She led her husband out the door, saying, ``Well, I don't think we'll
worry about a little bit of nausea and headache, will we, Fritz? This
medicine is helping you.''
   Mrs Firenze* had the opposite situation.
   Her debonair Italian husband, aged 93, sported a silk cravat, pearl
tiepin, and a polyester leisure suit. He wanted his ``marital rights''
twice daily.
   His younger wife was exhausted.
   At a number of visits, the old man asked, ``Don't you think my wife
should consider her husband's physical needs?''
She responded with frantic semaphore signals behind his back that showed
she didn't share his sexual appetite.
   Mr Firenze had severe pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. I don't know
how he had the energy to talk about sex, much less want it so often.
   One day, he came in with arrhythmia. He was lethargic, confused,
vomiting, and dehydrated; he'd had a strangulated inguinal hernia for 2
days. I called for an ambulance, then went back to explain the poor
prognosis to his wife.
   She listened carefully until I felt obliged to say, ``He's a poor risk
for surgery. He might die on the operating table. I wish the hospital was
closer. Even the short ambulance ride could kill him.''
   Bless her heart. She fought hard, trying to compose her face, but she
finally broke out into a lopsided grin.
   ``When we take the ambulance,'' she asked, ``could we go the long
way?''

*Names have been changed.

YOUR `WINDOW' TO THE WORLD'S INFORMATION

By:
Jerry F. Potts, MD

   Consider the paramecium. The little one-celled creature we all remember
from basic biology can be compared to the computer sitting in many a
physician's office, or at least to the way it's used.
   A one-celled organism is capable of simple functions (eg, it is motile
and can feed itself). Similarly, a physician's computer often sits alone,
unconnected to others, and completes simple tasks (eg, generates letters or
tracks accounts) with use of a small-business application.
   But when grouped, both organisms and computers become more complex
entities, capable of functioning at new levels that are stunning in their
diversity and exciting in their potential.

What computers can do
   Right now, the technology is available to bring radiographs directly
from the imaging equipment to the desktop screen and to allow the
radiologist and the clinician at the screen to discuss the radiographs as
they view them simultaneously.
   Right now, the technology is available to transfer the spoken word
directly into text on a word processor. Yes, the ``talking typewriter'' of
science fiction stories is now a science fact. And the ``picture
telephone'' is becoming common in the business world as computers and
telephone equipment merge.
   Right now, the technology is available to check a drug dose as you
prescribe it, to print out a personalized set of instructions for a
patient, and to enter information on that patient into an electronic
record.
   To take advantage of the technology that is already available, not to
mention what is coming up, physicians need to take a wider view of what a
computer can do. Rather than thinking of a computer as a tool with which to
accomplish a task, these days it may be more accurate to think of it as a
``window.'' Through it, physicians can see and choose information that is
available from nearly anywhere. As technology becomes simpler and more
standardized, fear of computers, which is already fading fast, will be
replaced with the confident attitude, ``I know it's there. How can I find
it?'' The dominant role of physicians of the future may well be to find and
interpret the most current information, wherever it resides.

What computer networks can do
   One of the latest trends in the computer world is networking. Experts
call for the eventual connection of virtually all computers. The
ramifications as this concept becomes reality are amazing to consider. Even
small networks (eg, a few computers within one office or clinic that can
communicate with each other) offer more information to physicians than what
is immediately available on a single computer.
   The biggest network of all, known as the Internet, is the driving force
behind a complete transformation of computers--from pieces of individual
equipment to mechanical members of large-group cooperatives. By some
counts, as many as 20 million computers now are connected to this worldwide
network of information. Until quite recently, the Internet was the
exclusive province of universities and military institutions. But as
technology advanced, more and more people started using the Internet to
``talk'' to others all over the world. Soon commercial interests came to
appreciate the ability to reach millions of computer-literate people at
virtually no cost.
   The Internet continues to grow at a tremendous rate. The standard method
of communication among corporations, students and others members of the
academic community, and many professionals throughout the world is
electronic mail passed through the network. Today, an Internet address is
almost as common on a business card as a telephone number.

What all this means to physicians
   Among the abundance of material that is readily available on the
Internet is medical information. Disease-prevention statistics,
medical-image files, reference databases, and many other types of text and
graphics are available with a few keystrokes if you know where to look.
Educational pieces for both physicians and patients are accessible and
useful. For minimal cost, you can view an encyclopedia (including audio and
video clips), and if you really want to, you can even watch a frog
dissection.
   In the near future, computer networking is likely to directly affect
physicians by changing the reimbursement process. Electronic submission of
claims is available and is already being used by the large healthcare
institutions. Almost certainly, electronic filing will become a
requirement, so significant changes will be needed in the business offices
of even small practices.
   Many people feel that they save personal time by using the Internet.
Users can plan trips, purchase tickets and other products, and make banking
transactions. They can also dial in to read the latest news or check up and
comment on legislation that is pending in Congress.
   And there are just-plain-fun aspects of networks. Discussion groups have
been formed around virtually every interest, from the arts to gardening to
tennis. Whatever your passion may be, you can chat about it with fellow
enthusiasts across the globe.
   My aim in coming columns is to look at a number of issues related to
computers and the Internet. I'll tell you about ways I've incorporated
computers into my practice and about some of the things ``out there'' that
are on my agenda to try. What's on your computer agenda? I'll be interested
to hear your stories and opinions, and we may share some of them in future
columns (with your permission, of course).
   It becomes more and more obvious the longer I work with computers and
networks that there are no limits to their practical applications in daily
life, especially since they are becoming easier and easier to use. Already,
daughter Elizabeth (aged 20 months) is displaying a tendency to monopolize
the home computer. Can her own e-mail address be far behind?
   Your comments and discoveries about using computers in practice and for
fun are welcome and may be published in Digital Doc. Contact Jerry F.

MEET JERRY POTTS

By:
Peter A. Setness, MD, Editor-in-Chief

   Computer poker! Teletype Star Trek! Thus began Jerry's noble and
altruistic interest in computers.
   But that was only high school and college stuff. During his residency
training in the early 1980s at Hayes Army Hospital, Fort Ord, California,
he attended a patient-wellness fair where the big drawing card was a fairly
new idea at the time--a computer printout of each person's results. With
hundreds of people awaiting their printout, the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer
locked up. To the great relief of the organizers, Jerry was able to get
things going again. As is the Army's way, it rewarded Jerry the Army
Service Medal for his act of selfless heroism. He is probably one of only a
few physicians to be decorated for computer work above and beyond the call
of duty.
   And once again he has fearlessly stepped forward, this time by
volunteering to write a column on computer use by busy practicing
physicians. Jerry is certainly one of those. He has been with the Family
Practice Department at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis since
1986 and is the department's assistant chief and a faculty member of the
residency training program. He is medical director of the Family Medical
Center, sees patients nearly every day, and in his spare time is working on
a prototype electronic medical record-keeping system for the clinic.
   In the limited remainder of his time, he has agreed to give us his
perspective on becoming a ``digital doc.'' Although he has a Mac IIcx at
home, a Pentium 90 at work, and an Apple IIe that he still uses regularly
for word processing (plus a Tandy model 100 in the closet), he really is a
physician first. His interest in computers is self-generated, and he uses
this interest at work to explore ways to facilitate and improve patient
care. This column will be a travelogue of Jerry's explorations--what works
for him and what doesn't.

MODERATE PARKINSON'S DISEASE: STRATEGIES FOR MAXIMIZING TREATMENT

By:
Paul M. Silverstein, MD


Preview
   Levodopa has long been the standard pharmacologic agent for treatment of
Parkinson's disease, but after long-term use of the drug, motor
fluctuations and dyskinesia occur in many patients. In this article, Dr
Silverstein discusses dosage adjustments, combination drug regimens, and
dietary changes that help to optimize symptomatic therapy. He also explores
the neuroprotective potential of selegiline in slowing progression of
Parkinson's disease.

   Parkinson's disease is a relentlessly progressive neurologic disorder
that affects primarily the elderly. Symptoms of the disease are sometimes
initially attributed to the aging process, but one or more of the cardinal
symptoms of parkinsonism--bradykinesia, a characteristic resting tremor,
postural instability, impaired gait and mobility, and limb rigidity--are
often clinically apparent. A number of other symptoms are less common
(table 1).
   Symptoms and rate of disease progression vary greatly among patients.
Once the diagnosis is established, the degree of functional impairment
dictates whether or not drug therapy is initiated. With the help of current
therapies, some patients continue working or lead a relatively normal life
for 10 years or more. But this was not always the case. According to a
study from 1967,1 (Reference) about two thirds of patients were severely
disabled 5 years after onset of the disease; more than 80% were severely
disabled or dead 10 years after onset. The rate of expected mortality has
decreased markedly since 1967, when physicians began to use levodopa
(Dopar, Larodopa)--the precursor to dopamine hydrochloride--for treatment
of Parkinson's disease.2 (Reference)
   Today, there are many options for pharmacologic management of
Parkinson's disease (table 2). This article summarizes a number of the most
current strategies for treating patients with moderate disease and
functional impairment.

What causes Parkinson's disease?
   The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but theories abound.
Although a link has not definitely been established, excessive free radical
formation and oxidative damage to the cells of the substantia nigra
probably play a role in development of the disease.3 (Reference)
   The pathology of Parkinson's disease is well defined: Intracytoplasmic
inclusions, progressive destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal
pathway, and consequent reduction of striatal concentration of dopamine are
characteristic.4 (Reference) Postmortem studies have revealed an 80% loss
of dopamine in the striatum at the time symptoms become clinically
apparent.5 (Reference) A deficiency of dopamine, which functions as a
neurotransmitter in the striatum and in other related brain centers,
results in the vast array of physical changes, cognitive dysfunction, and
depressive symptoms that characterize Parkinson's disease.

Slowing disease progression
   Neuroprotective therapy to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease
has become an important focus of treatment strategies recently. The
monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor selegiline hydrochloride
(Eldepryl) may moderate disease progression by reducing toxic free radical
formation, thereby sparing remaining neurons in the substantia nigra.
   Studies involving newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease show that
selegiline slowed the rate of symptom development and delayed the need for
levodopa therapy.6-8 (Reference) Whether this resulted from the drug's
symptomatic effect or from its neuroprotective effect on the neurons of the
substantia nigra remains controversial.9,10 (Reference) Selegiline has the
potential to exert a symptomatic effect because it increases intracellular
dopamine through its inhibition of MAO-B, which blocks the breakdown of
dopamine. Consequently, many clinicians choose selegiline for initial
therapy because of its potential to provide both symptomatic and
neuroprotective benefits.

Symptomatic treatment
   When a patient with Parkinson's disease becomes functionally disabled,
symptomatic treatment is initiated. The choice of the appropriate
pharmacologic intervention is determined by the patient's needs, extent of
disability, symptoms, age, presence or absence of cognitive dysfunction,
and response to initial drug therapy.
   In 1994, a panel of neurologists outlined treatment guidelines for
Parkinson's disease and developed an algorithm that helps maximize response
to drug therapy (figure 1). The algorithm is designed to help physicians
tailor treatment, especially in newly diagnosed cases.
   Currently, drugs used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease include
anticholinergics, amantadine hydrochloride (Symadine, Symmetrel), dopamine
agonists, and levodopa. Each of these agents relies on a different
mechanism of action in the brain and has a well-defined role in the
management of Parkinson's disease.
   Levodopa is currently the most effective treatment, but motor
fluctuations and dyskinesia develop in most patients after long-term
administration of the drug. Current research suggests that this is because
of gradual loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum and changes in the
response of the striatal receptor cells to dopamine.11 (Reference)
   In the normal brain, striatal receptor cells receive a continuous, tonic
stimulation from dopamine via the intact striatonigral pathway. The gradual
loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum diminishes the brain's
ability to continuously produce, store, and release dopamine. In
Parkinson's disease, postsynaptic changes seem to result from the
intermittent stimulation of striatal receptor cells that occurs when
standard levodopa is administered periodically during the day. As the
disease progresses, daily fluctuations in motor capability--ranging from
``wearing-off'' phenomena to sudden, unpredictable changes in mobility,
known as ``on-off'' syndrome--produce increasing disability. Choreiform or
dystonic dyskinesias also develop and are often disabling.
   Other factors thought to influence wearing-off phenomena are the
variability of gastric emptying and factors that influence levodopa
transport. Levodopa is absorbed into the duodenum and then must compete
with large neutral amino acids in the diet for transport across the gut
wall and into the bloodstream; similar competition occurs for transport
across the blood-brain barrier.12 (Reference) Gastric emptying into the
duodenum is delayed by large meals and the use of anticholinergic and
dopaminergic drugs and is a common consequence of advancing age.13
(Reference)

Motor fluctuations
   Management of motor fluctuations is challenging and not always
successful, but a number of strategies are worth trying. Many of these
treatment options share the principal goals of therapy: to sustain
therapeutic brain concentrations of levodopa and provide continuous
stimulation of the striatal receptor cells. These strategies attempt to
control the delivery of levodopa to the brain, modify its breakdown within
the brain, or bypass the presynaptic substantia nigra neuron that is
degenerating and directly stimulate the dopamine receptor.
   Dosage adjustments--Lower and more frequent doses of immediate-release
carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) throughout the day may help maintain
therapeutic levels in the blood. Providing a dose every 3 to 4 hours during
the day is often beneficial. It is important to give a sufficient amount of
levodopa with each dose to produce an effect; insufficient doses can result
in multiple dose failures during the day.
   Sustained-release preparation--Use of the sustained-release formulation
of carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet CR) prolongs the drug's benefit and helps
avoid wearing-off effects.14 (Reference) This strategy may help to prevent
further alteration in the striatal receptor response by providing a more
physiologic tonic stimulation. When patients change to the
sustained-release preparation, however, the daily levodopa dose must be
increased by 20% to 30% because of differences in bioavailability between
the two preparations. Patients who switch to the sustained-release
formulation often comment that they miss the initial ``kick'' they used to
receive from their first morning dose of regular carbidopa/levodopa. In
such cases, a combination regimen of 1 tablet of the immediate-release form
and 1 tablet of the sustained-release form may be taken as the initial
morning dose. This provides rapid onset of action and a prolonged effect.
   Liquid preparation--For selected patients who are highly compliant and
willing to adhere to a demanding therapeutic schedule, a liquid preparation
of carbidopa/levodopa can be mixed at home to counteract wearing-off
periods.15 (Reference) The standard formula calls for 10 tablets of
carbidopa/levodopa in the 25/100-mg strength and 2 g of ascorbic acid
crystals dissolved in 1 L of tap water. The patient drinks 75 mL of the
solution first thing in the morning and then consumes 35 to 50 mL/hr
thereafter. This preparation works well for many patients who have motor
fluctuations, but a fair amount of fine-tuning is usually required to
establish the correct dose.
   Dopamine agonists--Addition of a dopamine agonist to the
carbidopa/levodopa regimen often results in substantial improvement of
motor fluctuations, because dopamine agonists directly stimulate dopamine
receptors16 (Reference) (figure 2). The two agonists that are currently
available in the United States, bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) and
pergolide mesylate (Permax), differ in the way they stimulate the striatal
receptors but have virtually the same effect. A patient who does not
respond to one of the agonists may benefit from the other.
   Daily doses of 15 to 30 mg of bromocriptine generally suffice when the
agonist is added to the carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Doses of 2 to 4 mg of
pergolide per day usually are required to avoid wearing-off effects. When a
dopamine agonist is added to this regimen, the carbidopa/levodopa schedule
is often modified so that smaller, more frequent doses are administered.
For example, a patient taking the 25/250-mg strength of carbidopa/levodopa
three times a day might be switched to the 25/100-mg strength six times per
day. Supplemental dopamine agonist therapy helps smooth out fluctuations.
   Mao-b inhibitors--Use of a selected MAO-B inhibitor, such as selegiline,
may help manage motor fluctuations.17 (Reference) MAO-B inhibitors block
the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine and extend the duration of levodopa
effect. The addition of 5 mg of selegiline twice a day generally requires a
10% to 20% reduction in carbidopa/levodopa to avoid levodopa peak-dose side
effects, such as increased dyskinesia.
   Amantadine also may help some patients. The drug appears to enhance the
release of dopamine, thereby prolonging the amount of ``on'' time that
patients experience.
   Dietary modifications--Large neutral amino acids in the diet can
significantly alter the effect of levodopa by competing with the drug for
transport, primarily across the blood-brain barrier.18 (Reference) Thus, a
meal that is high in protein may diminish the effect of a recent dose of
carbidopa/levodopa. Most patients can avoid this problem by taking their
medication about 30 to 45 minutes before eating. For patients with more
severe fluctuations, a protein-redistribution diet, in which most protein
is consumed in the evening, may be indicated.19 (Reference) Another option
is to consume a balanced carbohydrate-protein diet, for which products are
available commercially. Both of these dietary modifications enhance the
transport of levodopa across the blood-brain barrier and, consequently, at
the dopamine nerve terminals.
   Enteral infusion--In rare cases in which pronounced, disabling
fluctuations cannot be stabilized with other techniques, continuous enteral
infusion of levodopa through a percutaneous gastrojejunal tube may be
warranted.20 (Reference) The challenge is to convince patients of the
benefits of this invasive delivery method.

Dyskinesia
   After 3 years of treatment with levodopa, about half of patients have
dyskinesia.11 (Reference) Muenter and associates21 (Reference) described
dyskinesia as occurring in two patterns: dystonia-improvement-dystonia and
improvement-dystonia-improvement. Treatment is often problematic, but
several strategies may be helpful.
   Peak-dose dyskinesia--The improvement-dystonia-improvement pattern, or
peak-dose dyskinesia, is relatively common. Choreic or dystonic movements
of the head, trunk, limbs and, occasionally, respiratory muscles are
characteristic. Lowering each individual dose of carbidopa/levodopa by a
small amount may help. If motor response deteriorates, a dopamine agonist,
such as bromocriptine or pergolide, may be added. The use of
sustained-release rather than standard carbidopa/levodopa may be beneficial
for this type of dyskinesia because lower peak-dose levodopa blood levels
are achieved. Finally, for patients taking selegiline, discontinuation of
the drug may help reduce dopamine concentrations in the brain.
   Diphasic dyskinesia--The dystonia-improvement-dystonia pattern, or
diphasic dyskinesia, develops with advanced Parkinson's disease and is more
difficult to correct. Abnormal movements are often coarser, associated with
limb pain, and observed when plasma levodopa levels are increasing or
decreasing. This pattern of dyskinesia may respond to more frequent dosing
of carbidopa/levodopa, which helps to achieve a more steady ``on'' state.
Increasing each dose may help, but this approach usually fails over time.
Another strategy is to switch patients with diphasic dyskinesia to an
agonist drug for primary therapy and then supplement the regimen with
smaller doses of carbidopa/levodopa. Use of sustained-release
carbidopa/levodopa may aggravate this pattern of dyskinesia, most likely
because a slower flux of levodopa levels in the blood may contribute to
development rather than treatment of dyskinesias.
   Foot cramps--Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease may have painful
foot cramps in the morning or occasionally late in the afternoon because of
dystonic posturing of the foot. During the cramps, blood levels of levodopa
are critically low. Administration of baclofen (Lioresal),
sustained-release carbidopa/levodopa, or dopamine agonist therapy provides
relief.

Summary
   Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia often develop in patients with
Parkinson's disease after 3 to 5 years of levodopa therapy. Dosage
adjustments, addition of a second medication to the drug regimen, and
dietary modifications may help maximize response to symptomatic therapy.
Given the dramatic variability of symptoms and response to treatment, drug
regimens must be individualized according to the patient's needs.
   In newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease, administration of
selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl) may slow symptom development and delay
the need for levodopa therapy. Many physicians prescribe selegiline
initially for its symptomatic and potential neuroprotective benefits.

PNEUMONIA, A FIVE ARTICLE SYMPOSIUM
COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: WHAT'S NEEDED FOR ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS

By:
Thomas M. File Jr, MD

Preview
   Community-acquired pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and
death, particularly in the elderly and in patients with underlying disease.
Identification of a specific cause on clinical grounds often is not
possible, and even extensive studies may not reveal the responsible
pathogen. In this article, the authors concentrate on the factors that
contribute to a reliable diagnosis.

   Several important changes have made diagnosis and management of
community-acquired pneumonia a greater challenge than ever. These include
an expanding number of possible pathogens, increasing antimicrobial
resistance, the influence of HIV infection, and the rising prevalence of
tuberculosis in US communities.1-4 (Reference) There is also a stimulus to
be as cost-effective as possible, and the primary care physician must try
to balance reasonable use of diagnostic tests with empirical therapy. This
review focuses on diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in the context
of these changes.

Clinical diagnosis
   The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is based on a combination
of clinical and laboratory data. These include characteristic clinical
findings (fever, cough, and rhonchi or rales on auscultation), the presence
of a new infiltrate on chest films, and documentation of a causative
microorganism.
   Although patients with community-acquired pneumonia usually present with
cough and fever, the differential diagnosis is extensive and includes upper
and lower respiratory tract infections as well as noninfectious causes (ie,
reactive airways disease, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary malignancy).
Because most upper respiratory tract infections are of viral origin and are
self-limited, little diagnostic testing or antimicrobial therapy is
warranted, thus reducing the use of resources. Similarly, antibiotics are
not warranted for acute bronchitis.5 (Reference) In contrast, antimicrobial
therapy is usually indicated for pneumonia.
   Chest films--The definition of community-acquired pneumonia includes the
finding of new infiltrates on chest films. However, the prevalence of
pneumonia among adults with respiratory symptoms ranges from only 3% in a
general outpatient setting to 28% in emergency departments.1 (Reference)
Several factors have been found to be predictors of the presence of
pneumonic infiltrates on chest films: temperature higher than 37.7 degrees
C (100 degrees F), pulse rate more than 100 beats per minute, rales,
locally de-creased breath sounds, sputum production, and the absence of
asthma, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Although these predictors serve as
guidelines, they certainly do not replace clinical judgment.
   We recognize that it is not practical to obtain a chest film in all
situations, but it can be helpful in differentiating conditions that mimic
pneumonia, and the findings may suggest causes or conditions such as
pneumocystic disease, tuberculosis, lung abscess, and pleural fluid.
Elderly patients with pneumonia may present with nonspecific
manifestations, such as a change in mental status, and the threshold for
considering pneumonia and obtaining chest films in such patients must be
lowered. Finally, pulmonary ``infiltrates'' may be falsely interpreted as
acute pneumonia if old chest films are not available to differentiate acute
from chronic changes; this is also a risk in patients with noninflammatory
causes of infiltration (ie, congestive heart failure, atelectasis). Thus,
appropriate evaluation of the chest film relies on accurate clinical
assessment.
   Hospital admission--Once pneumonia is suggested by findings on chest
films, the primary care physician must determine who can be safely treated
as an outpatient and who should be hospitalized. Indications for hospital
admission have been defined by a modified version of the appropriateness
evaluation protocol, a validated instrument used widely by quality
assurance organizations.6 (Reference) The specific indications for hospital
admission and risk factors for death are listed in table 1. Laboratory
studies that help clarify the severity of community-acquired pneumonia
include a hemogram, electrolyte determinations, and pulse oximetry or
measurement of arterial blood gases.

Etiology
   As noted, determining a specific cause of community-acquired pneumonia
has been made more challenging by the growing number of possible pathogens.
Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the leader, but recent reports have
recognized other microorganisms, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella
species, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and, very recently, sin nombre
virus, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.1-4,7 (Reference) Other
known causes include Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, oral
anaerobes (associated with aspiration pneumonia), and viruses (influenza
virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus).
Penicillin-resistant strains of S pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing
strains of H influenzae and M catarrhalis have been isolated with
increasing frequency.
   Although secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza is most commonly
due to S pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus also needs to be considered.
Gram-negative bacilli should be suspected when the patient is from a
nursing home. Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii and other opportunistic
patho-gens has emerged in the past several years in association with HIV
infection and should be included in the differential diagnosis. In
addition, pulmonary tuberculosis has been increasingly implicated in cases
of community-acquired pneumonia over the past several years and deserves
consideration whenever the cause cannot be readily explained. Table 2 shows
the expanding list of pathogens to be aware of when evaluating
community-acquired pneumonia in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised
patients.
   Several recent studies have determined the relative proportion of
specific causes of community-acquired pneumonia; table 3 shows data from
three such studies3,4,8 (Reference) and distinguishes between pneumonia
treated on an outpatient basis and that treated in a hospital. Traditional
pathogens such as S pneumoniae and H influenzae account for 25% to 40% of
cases. Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, or Legionella species (often
referred to as ``atypical'') comprise another 15% to 30% of cases. In table
4, the most common causes are correlated with patient categories that are
based on disease severity and comorbidities.
   In most studies, a specific cause is not found for 30% to 50% of cases
of community-acquired pneumonia. A percentage of such cases may indeed not
be infectious pneumonia. It is well known that other conditions, such as
vasculitis, drug reactions, and pulmonary infarction, may present with
manifestations mimicking infectious pneumonia. Unrecognized pathogens
undoubtedly account for a certain percentage of undefined cases.
   Detailed history taking may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis.
Epidemiologic clues to possible pathogens are listed in table 5. A
controversial issue concerns whether the cause of pneumonia (eg,
pneumococcus versus mycoplasma versus legionella) can be differentiated on
the basis of clinical features. Certain findings are likely to be
associated with specific causes: Acute onset and a single shaking chill
(rigor) are cardinal features of streptococcal pneumonia; markedly elevated
temperature (higher than 39.4 degrees C [103 degrees F]) is more common
with legionella pneumonia; prodromal fever and myalgia followed by
pulmonary edema and hypotension are characteristic of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome; diarrhea is more common with atypical pneumonia; and underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is more often seen with bacterial
pneumonia.3,8 (Reference) In addition, there are reports of associated
asthma in patients who have elevated chlamydial antibody titers.9
(Reference) It is our experience, however, that asthma is unlikely to be
associated with the primary infection, and recent data from others do not
support a significant role for acute C pneumoniae infection in provoking
acute bronchospasm in adults.10,11 (Reference) Despite these clinical
clues, recent studies have shown that clinical findings overlap in cases of
pneumonia caused by different agents, rendering distinction on a clinical
basis unreliable.5,6 (Reference)

Specific diagnostic evaluation
   Once the clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia has been
made, consideration should be given to the microbiologic diagnosis. Such
information can be useful for both prognosis and therapy. Unfortunately,
rapid diagnostic tests are not available for many of the microorganisms,
and initial therapy is usually empirical. However, diagnostic procedures
that provide information on a specific cause within 48 to 72 hours can
still help define continuing therapy.
   Identification of the specific cause relies on isolating the
microorganism or on determining the presence of a specific antigen or
antibody. Table 6 lists the diagnostic tests that we recommend for
evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia. However, it must be
reemphasized that even after extensive studies are done, the pathogen
remains unidentified in 30% to 50% of cases.
   The extent of diagnostic evaluation that is undertaken depends to a
degree on the severity of illness. Patients under age 60 who do not have
underlying disease can often be safely treated without diagnostic tests;
oral antimicrobial agents directed against the pathogens that are most
commonly seen in this group (S pneumoniae, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia
species) can be given.
   Because of the greater potential for serious morbidity (and mortality),
patients who require hospitalization should have diagnostic evaluation. The
difficulty in specifying a cause on clinical grounds and the awareness of
antimicrobial resistance that reduces the predictability of response to any
given antibiotic are additional important reasons to define the pathogen in
these patients.
   Sputum evaluation--Although sputum evaluation may be helpful, often it
is not available. Studies of sputum include both staining procedures and
cultures. The significance and predictability of Gram's stain are
debatable.12 (Reference) Nevertheless, we believe that it can be useful in
diagnosis and therapy when there is a predominance of gram-positive or
gram-negative organisms from an appropriate specimen (ie, one with a large
number of neutrophils and a paucity of squamous epithelial cells). All too
often, however, sputum smears demonstrate only normal oral flora, are of
poor quality, or are unobtainable. Nonetheless, the direct results of a
sputum stain may be helpful in defining some pulmonary infections,
including those caused by mycobacteria.
   Similarly, routine sputum cultures are neither sensitive nor specific.
They often show pathogens that are only colonizing the respiratory tract,
and even in cases of bacteremic pneumonia, the causative pathogen can be
isolated from sputum culture in only 40% to 60% of cases.
   In contrast, recovery from cultures of organisms that are never part of
the respiratory flora may be meaningful; therefore, in appropriate
circumstances, sputum should be cultured for mycobacteria, legionellae, and
fungi. (The physician must be aware that special, selective media are
needed for such organisms and that the laboratory must be advised in these
situations.) Isolation of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and other
antibiotic-resistant microorganisms can also be very meaningful and helpful
in directing subsequent therapy. Culture of M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae is
possible, but it is difficult and requires specialized techniques. Because
of this, most microbiology laboratories are not set up to culture these
organisms, and diagnosis is usually based on serologic tests.
   Blood and pleural fluid cultures--Blood cultures should always be done
when a patient requires hospitalization. Although they are positive in only
about 10% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, diagnosis is specific.
Similarly, cultures of pleural fluid, if it is present, are highly specific
and should be done to rule out complicated parapneumonic fusion or empyema
as well as to establish the cause of community-acquired pneumonia.
   Invasive techniques--More invasive diagnostic techniques, such as
fiberoptic bronchoscopy, can be very sensitive in identifying the pathogen.
Although such techniques are expensive and impractical for routine use,
they should be considered for patients with a fulminant course, those who
require admission to the intensive care unit, and those who are at risk for
opportunistic pathogens or have complex pneumonias that are unresponsive to
antimicrobial therapy.
   Serologic tests--These are usually not helpful in the initial assessment
of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. They can be worthwhile for
epidemiologic purposes when they show a fourfold rise between acute and
convalescent paired specimens. Cold agglutinins may be present in cases of
mycoplasmal infection, but tests are positive in only a minority of cases
and are not specific. IgM antibodies may be present in serum within the
first week of mycoplasmal infection, but the serologic response to
chlamydia and legionella takes longer. The most reliable antibody test for
C pneumoniae is a microimmunofluorescence technique. Complement-fixation
antibody tests are available but are not as specific. In cases of primary
infection due to C pneumoniae, the IgM antibody response may take up to 4
weeks and the IgG antibody response up to 8 weeks to appear. Therefore, the
absence of detectable antibodies (even IgM) several weeks after infection
does not exclude the diagnosis. During reinfection, the IgG antibody level
rises rapidly, whereas the IgM antibody level may not change.
   Results of the acute antibody test for legionella in cases of
legionnaires' disease are usually negative or of low titer because it is
too early in the course of illness to engender a response; thus, a negative
result on an acute antibody test does not exclude this diagnosis.
Unfortunately, we have observed cases of community-acquired pneumonia in
which appropriate therapy was not administered because of misinterpretation
of the ``negative'' acute antibody test. An elevated acute antibody titer
suggests a diagnosis of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma, Legionella, or
Chlamydia species, but it is not definitive. It has been acceptable to
label a case as ``probable'' or ``presumptive'' if the acute titer is
highly elevated (see following section on diagnostic criteria); however, it
is our experience that a single elevated titer (without confirmation by
another test such as culture or antigen detection) often reflects old
rather than acute infection. In a study of legionnaires' disease in Ohio,
we found that an acute antibody titer of more than 1:256 had a positive
predictive value for acute legionnaires' disease of only 15%.13 (Reference)
The percentage of patients with elevated acute titers who had confirmed
legionnaires' disease was not significantly different from that of patients
who did not. Thus, on the basis of our own experience, we believe that
acute-phase serum specimens should be obtained for patients with
community-acquired pneumonia and saved. If the pathogen remains in
question, a convalescent-phase specimen can be obtained and paired studies
performed.
   Rapid diagnostic tests--The urinary antigen test, which has recently
become available in most reference laboratories, has been shown to be very
valuable for rapid identification of legionella. Present techniques test
only for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, but this organism accounts for
about 80% of clinical cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to
legionella. The urinary antigen test is positive in about 80% of cases
within the first days of illness and is highly specific. A negative test
does not exclude legionella pneumonia (particularly if caused by organisms
other than serogroup 1), but a positive test is diagnostic.
   Several rapid diagnostic tests, such as DNA probes or polymerase chain
amplification for evaluation of respiratory secretions or serum, are being
developed (especially for chlamydial, mycoplasmal, and legionella
pneumonia) but are not routinely available at present. Once such tests
become available, they should be extremely helpful in allowing directed
therapy at presentation.
   Diagnostic criteria--The specificity of diagnosis varies with the test
used. For example, a positive blood culture for S pneumoniae is much more
specific than a positive sputum culture without a positive blood culture.
Accordingly, the following would generally be considered as evidence of
definite infection by a specific microorganism:
   1. Blood or pleural fluid yielding a pathogen
   2. A fourfold rise in antibody titer to L pneumophila, M pneumoniae, C
pneumoniae, or other specific pathogen
   3. Isolation of L pneumophila, influenza virus, or Mycobacterium
tuberculosis from respiratory secretions
   4. Positive legionella urinary antigen test
   Isolation of a pathogen from purulent sputum with identification of a
compatible organism on Gram's stain is generally considered to be evidence
of probable cause. Similarly, presence of a single elevated antibody titer
(legionella immunofluorescent antibody titer greater than 1:250 or C
pneumoniae microimmunofluorescent antibody titer greater than 1:512 [IgG]
or 1:16 [IgM]) has been considered evidence for presumptive diagnosis by
several authorities. However, as we have stated previously, it is our
experience that these criteria are often unreliable.
   In conclusion, the physician must consider the usefulness of various
diagnostic tests when formulating an initial plan of management for a
patient with community-acquired pneumonia. While the results of certain
procedures (blood culture or legionella urinary antigen test) are specific,
the results of others (sputum culture and initial serologic tests) are only
presumptive. With the exception of the sputum Gram stain (with its
acknowledged pitfalls), there are no immediately available rapid diagnostic
tests; thus, initial therapy is usually empirical.

Summary
   Characteristic clinical findings of fever, cough, and rhonchi, together
with a new infiltrate on chest films and documentation of a pathogen,
establish a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia. Several factors have had an
impact on the approach to diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia by the
primary care physician. These include the expanding number of possible
pathogens as well as their increasing resistance to antimicrobial therapy.
   Although the clinical presentation may suggest a specific cause,
findings often overlap too much for reliable identification of the specific
agent on clinical grounds alone. Isolation of the micro-organism or
determination of the presence of a specific antigen or antibody is
necessary. However, even after extensive studies are performed, the
pathogen remains unidentified in 30% to 50% of cases. The primary care
physician therefore needs to balance reasonable use of diagnostic tests
with empirical therapy.

PNEUMONIA, A FIVE-ARTICLE SYMPOSIUM: INTRODUCTION

By:
Burke A. Cunha, MD, SYMPOSIUM COORDINATOR

   Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases encountered in
practice. The first step in evaluation should be to determine whether the
patient does, in fact, have pneumonia. Patients usually have a variety of
nonspecific respiratory symptoms, which should be sorted out as originating
in either the upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract
infections (eg, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis) cause no
pulmonary signs. The presence of pulmonary findings, with or without
symptoms of upper respiratory infection, points to pneumonia.
   Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia rests on auscultatory and chest film
findings. Laboratory findings may be absent very early in the infection and
in the presence of leukopenia or dehydration. Similarly, the lungs are
conspicuously quiet in viral or interstitial pneumonia (eg, viral
influenza).
   Sputum may originate in the bronchi or alveoli, and findings on testing
of such samples are helpful in suggesting pneumonia only if they relate to
the infiltrate or chest film. Testing of a properly collected sputum
specimen from the lower respiratory tract is useful in suggesting the
causative agent in community-acquired pneumonia but is useless in
nosocomial pneumonia. In the right clinical context, a sputum Gram stain is
helpful, but unless it is absolutely diagnostic, initial treatment should
be empirical. Characteristics of sputum may provide diagnostic clues to the
type of community-acquired pneumonia. For example, thin, mucoid sputum
suggests atypical pneumonia, compared with the frankly purulent sputum that
suggests a bacterial process.
   Chest films are key in investigation of community-acquired pneumonia.
They confirm the diagnosis, and specific findings often suggest a
particular organism. For example, pleural effusion, cavitation, and lobar
involvement are helpful findings when interpreted in the proper clinical
context. The behavior of infiltrates over time may be diagnostically
useful. Those that clear rapidly (1 or 2 days) probably are not infectious,
but rapidly progressive asymmetric infiltrates suggest legionella
infection. Infiltrates may be absent if chest films are obtained very early
in the disease process but usually appear within 24 hours after the patient
presents for medical attention.
   Even when an infiltrate is present, the diagnosis of community-acquired
pneumonia may be uncertain. Many conditions mimic pneumonia, and unless the
cause is quickly recognized as noninfectious, needless expense, potential
antibiotic resistance, and delay in proper treatment may result.
   Failure of pneumonia to resolve represents another issue. Delayed
resolution of community-acquired pneumonia is being recognized increasingly
in elderly and immunocompromised patients.
   Because virtually any antibiotic with an appropriate spectrum provides
adequate treatment of pneumonia, the challenge is to find the most
cost-efficient approach and monitor clinical effectiveness. An important
new development, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness, is the
capability to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. For
example, at Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York, the difference
between intravenous and oral therapy with one particular antibiotic is $74
versus $5.44 per day. The goal is to select an oral antibiotic that is
active against both typical and atypical pathogens, has good
bioavailability and low resistance potential, and is cost-effective.
Unfortunately, relatively few oral agents meet these criteria.
   In patients requiring hospital admission, antibiotic therapy should be
started intravenously and then, if clinically possible, switched after 3
days to an oral form for completion of therapy. Recent studies have shown
that oral therapy is effective in a variety of infectious diseases, even in
very ill patients. Although oral therapy will never be possible in all
patients, the era of oral antibiotic therapy is clearly upon us, not only
because of economic pressures but also because of new knowledge. This
symposium presents an overview of the latest research findings, as well as
practical information gained from the school of clinical experience.

ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA: EXTRAPULMONARY CLUES GUIDE THE WAY TO DIAGNOSIS

By:
Burke A. Cunha, MD
Antonio M. Ortega, MD

Preview
   As the name implies, atypical pneumonia does not follow the usual form.
However, infecting organisms do cause characteristic patterns of organ
involvement, which provide important clues to clinicians. The authors
describe clinical diagnosis of the most common causative organisms of
atypical pneumonia by means of a syndromic approach. They also discuss
which antimicrobial agents have been found to be useful against these
organisms.

   Certain pathogens are typically associated with community-acquired
pneumonia, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococci,
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and, less
often, Klebsiella species. In patients recovering from viral infection and
occasionally in diabetic patients, Staphylococcus aureus infection is
found.
Community-acquired pneumonia can also be caused by less common pathogens.
These atypical pneumonias are divided into two forms: nonzoonotic (ie, not
transmitted from animals to humans) and zoonotic (transmissible from
animals). Nonzoonotic forms are the more common and are an important
diagnostic consideration in evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia.
   This article presents an overview of the clinical approach to three
nonzoonotic atypical pneumonias: legionnaires' disease (caused by
Legionella species), mycoplasmal pneumonia (caused by Mycoplasma
pneumoniae), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (strain TWAR) pneumonia (table 1).
Although zoonotic pneumonia is not discussed in detail, characteristics of
three forms are summarized in table 2 for use in differential diagnosis:
psittacosis (caused by Chlamydia psittaci), Q fever (caused by Coxiella
burnetii), and tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis).
   Thorough reviews of both typical and atypical causes of
community-acquired pneumonia are available in the literature.1-4
(Reference)

Diagnostic approach
   Although the microorganisms in atypical pneumonia usually cause
prominent pulmonary manifestations, the illness should be viewed as a
systemic infectious disease with a pulmonary component. Indeed, it is the
extrapulmonary manifestations that are a hallmark, so if a case of
pneumonia is accompanied by otherwise unexplained extrapulmonary signs,
symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities, atypical pneumonia should be
presumed.
   Whether a patient has nonzoonotic or zoonotic atypical pneumonia should
be established if possible. A history of contact with animals or animal
products is usually available to suggest a zoonotic form. If no
epidemiologic associations or diagnostic clues point to a zoonotic atypical
pathogen, the working diagnosis is quickly narrowed to the more common,
nonzoonotic forms.5-8 (Reference)
   Carefully conducted history taking and physical examination should be
completed in an attempt to define organ involvement by the putative
pathogen. All organisms causing atypical pneumonia have a characteristic
pattern of organ involvement that provides clues to diagnosis of these
pneumonias. Key findings include relative bradycardia, upper respiratory
tract involvement, diarrhea, abnormalities in liver function tests,
elevation of cold agglutinin titer, and decreased serum phosphorus level.
Very few findings are in themselves pathognomonic of any disease process;
it is the pattern of occurrence that makes the constellation of findings
diagnostically specific.5-7 (Reference) Thus, a syndromic approach, in
which history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are combined,
is best in establishing a working diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. For
example, assume a patient with community-acquired pneumonia and
extrapulmonary findings has atypical pneumonia. If he or she also has
diarrhea, the diagnosis is clearly limited to legionnaires' disease or
mycoplasmal pneumonia. If the patient has a pulse-temperature deficit (ie,
relative bradycardia), diagnostic possibilities include legionnaires'
disease, psittacosis, or Q fever. Similarly, even a slight unexplainable
abnormality in results of liver function tests in a patient with atypical
pneumonia limits diagnostic possibilities to legionnaires' disease,
psittacosis, or Q fever. Hyponatremia is a common but nonspecific finding,
but the finding of hypophosphatemia points to legionnaires' disease.
   Since legionnaires' disease, mycoplasmal pneumonia, and C pneumoniae
pneumonia are the most often encountered atypical pneumonias, the main
diagnostic thrust should be to identify the pathogens responsible for these
forms. Mycoplasmal infection in normal hosts and C pneumoniae pneumonia in
young adults are rarely fatal, so workup should first focus on identifying
or eliminating legionnaires' disease, which can be fatal if left
untreated.
   Serologic diagnosis of all these atypical pathogens is made on the basis
of a single initial high titer or a fourfold increase between acute and
convalescent titers.

Legionnaires' disease
   Legionnaires' disease may be caused by any of the Legionella species.
The highest incidence is in late summer and early fall, but cases can occur
at any time of the year. Legionnaires' disease is transmitted by
aerosolized droplets of water. For example, outbreaks have occurred in
hospitals as a result of contaminated water sources or nearby excavation or
construction. Although legionnaires' disease is treatable with
tetracyclines and macrolide antibiotics, fatalities still occur in elderly
patients and compromised hosts. Therefore, early presumptive diagnosis is
essential so appropriate treatment can be started as soon as possible.
   Legionnaires' disease presents clinically and radiologically as atypical
pneumonia. Its onset is usually subacute but may be fulminant. Pulmonary
manifestations are not sufficiently different from those caused by other
pulmonary pathogens to permit a specific diagnosis. As noted earlier, the
clinical clues lie in extrapulmonary findings, as they do in other types of
atypical pneumonia.
   Signs and symptoms--Legionnaires' disease is characterized by relative
bradycardia, mental status changes or mild headache, abdominal discomfort
or pain, and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms do not respond to beta-lactam
antibiotics. Ear pain, sore throat, or rash argues strongly against the
diagnosis of legionnaires' disease.
   Chest films--With atypical pneumonia, a specific diagnosis cannot be
made from the appearance on chest films. However, legionnaires' disease
should be suspected in patients who have pneumonia and rapidly progressive
asymmetric infiltrates.5,6 (Reference)
   Laboratory findings--Certain laboratory tests are helpful in making a
presumptive diagnosis of some atypical pneumonias. A slight increase in
serum transaminase levels (without antecedent alcoholic cirrhosis or liver
disease) in a patient presumed to have atypical pneumonia immediately
limits diagnostic possibilities to legionnaires' disease, psittacosis, or Q
fever. Hyponatremia is more common in legionnaires' disease than in other
atypical pneumonias but is not specific for legionella infection.
Hypophosphatemia (except in patients who have other causes of a low serum
phosphorus level) strongly implicates a Legionella species as the infecting
organism in patients with atypical pneumonia.
   Moderate to high elevation of cold agglutinin titers argues strongly
against the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease. (Elevation of these titers
is useful primarily in diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia.)
   Initial serum legionella titers are diagnostically helpful only if
highly elevated (ie, greater than or equal 1:256) in a patient with illness
compatible with legionnaires' disease. The usual situation is that the
physician suspects legionnaires' disease and orders serologic workup, only
to find that initial results are normal. In most patients with
legionnaires' disease, titers are not elevated early in the disease;
therefore, normal levels should not exclude the diagnosis. About 6 to 8
weeks after the onset of disease, titers should be obtained; at this point,
a diagnostic elevation is usually present.
   If a patient with legionella pneumonia has a productive cough and has
not received prior antimicrobial therapy, a diagnosis of legionnaires'
disease may be rapidly confirmed with a direct fluorescent antibody stain
for legionella organisms in the sputum. However, legionella positivity on
this stain decreases rapidly after effective antibiotic therapy has begun.
Some patients do not have effective antibody responses, and antimicrobial
therapy itself may blunt, delay, or eliminate antibody responses so that
there is little or no elevation in legionella titers. Therefore, without a
positive sputum direct fluorescent antibody test for legionella, the
initial working diagnosis must be made on the basis of clinical findings by
using the syndromic approach mentioned.

Mycoplasmal pneumonia
   M pneumoniae infection is one of the most common causes of atypical
pneumonia. This agent and the Legionella species are capable of growth in
cell-free media, which sets them apart from all other causative agents in
atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasmal pneumonia occurs at any time of the year,
although small epidemics during the late fall or winter, coincident with
the school year, are common. This finding is not surprising, given the fact
that transmission of the disease is from person to person via respiratory
droplets.
   Patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia seen in the office probably
represent a small proportion of cases, since most infections are benign and
self-limited. Many patients do not appear to be very ill, despite
abnormalities on chest films. This observation has led to the term
``walking pneumonia'' to describe the illness. On the other hand, patients
may appear very ill yet have only small, wispy infiltrates on chest films.
   Signs and symptoms--Onset of the disease is insidious and follows a 2-
to 3-week incubation period. The most characteristic sign is a dry cough,
which is usually unproductive. Other symptoms include mild headache,
malaise, nonpleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fever (usually between 101
and 102 degrees F [38.3 and 38.8 degrees C]). Patients often report
chilliness, but frank chills are uncommon. Chest pain is uncommon but, if
present, is due to muscle strain from repeated coughing.
   Its subacute onset and the absence of severe myalgias are important
clues distinguishing mycoplasmal pneumonia from viral pneumonia. Diarrhea
is common in mycoplasmal pneumonia, legionnaires' disease, and some of the
adenoviral pneumonias.
   Chest films--Despite the severity of cough, there is usually a paucity
of chest findings and no evidence of consolidation. Chest films usually
show infiltrates in the lung interstitium.
   Physical examination--Extrapulmonary manifestations are different from
and less evident than those of legionnaires' disease. Practically all organ
systems can be involved, since mycoplasmal pneumonia is a systemic
infectious disease.
   Skin manifestations are common and range from maculopapular eruptions to
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which occurs in 5% to 10% of patients. Cardiac
involvement is the next most common extrapulmonary manifestation;
abnormalities may include arrhythmias, conduction defects, and congestive
heart failure. Neurologic complications are uncommon and include
meningoencephalitis and reversible transverse myelitis.
   Laboratory findings--Except for demonstration of elevated cold
agglutinin titers, routine laboratory tests are generally unhelpful in
diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. Cold agglutinins, which also occur in
viral infections, are not specific for mycoplasma, and they are elevated in
less than 75% of patients with the infection. However, the degree of cold
agglutinin response is greatest in mycoplasmal pneumonia; the higher the
titer is above 1:64 in a patient with pneumonia, the more likely the
diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia.
   The agglutinin-dissociation test is a quick bedside procedure for making
this determination. It consists of collecting blood in an oxalated tube and
immersing it, along with a control specimen, in wet ice for 1 to 2 minutes.
Agglutination of erythrocytes (with a negative control) on the side of the
glass tube and their disappearance on rewarming to 98.6 degrees F (37
degrees C) indicate that cold agglutinins are present in a titer of 1:64 or
more. Repeated agglutination on repeated immersion after rewarming
indicates the presence of mycoplasma, since viral cold agglutinins do not
exhibit this agglutination-dissociation behavior.
   The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG antibodies can
cause much diagnostic confusion. An elevated mycoplasma titer (otherwise
uncharacterized) is invariably an IgG determination. An elevated titer
indicates past exposure rather than active disease, and patients should not
be diagnosed or treated on the basis of this finding. In contrast, an
elevated IgM titer usually indicates active disease, especially when
accompanied by extrapulmonary signs of mycoplasmal pneumonia.6,7
(Reference)

C pneumoniae pneumonia
   C pneumoniae is a common causative agent in respiratory tract diseases;
those seen most often by physicians are pneumonia and severe upper
respiratory tract infection. C pneumoniae pneumonia occurs sporadically but
may also present as outbreaks among college students or military recruits.
Transmission is from person to person via respiratory droplets. Children
are less likely than adults to acquire pneumonia; however, seropositivity
increases after the second decade of life, reflecting subliminal childhood
illness.
   It is important to consider C pneumoniae pneumonia early in the illness,
because macrolide antibiotics are relatively ineffective. The
characteristic presentation of C pneumoniae pneumonia is a mycoplasmal
pneumonia-like illness with laryngitis and failure to improve with use of
erythromycin. Tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline [Doryx, Vibramycin]) are the
preferred therapy for chlamydial pneumonias (eg, C pneumoniae pneumonia,
psittacosis).
   Signs and symptoms--C pneumoniae pneumonia may present in a manner
similar to mycoplasmal pneumonia, except for the frequent finding of
concurrent upper respiratory tract illness (eg, laryngitis). Sinusitis and
pharyngitis sometimes precede the onset of C pneumoniae pneumonia by a few
days to a week. Although pharyngitis and otitis are common findings in
mycoplasmal pneumonia, sinusitis is not. The presence of laryngitis and
hoarseness points to C pneumoniae pneumonia; laryngitis is not a feature of
other atypical pneumonias.
   Chest films--Patchy consolidation or interstitial infiltrates may be
revealed on chest films. Infiltrates are sometimes described as
funnel-shaped and, if present, may be a clue to the diagnosis. In C
pneumoniae pneumonia, unlike in mycoplasmal pneumonia, auscultation of the
chest may reveal evidence of consolidation; however, like in mycoplasmal
pneumonia, pleural effusions are uncommon.
   Laboratory findings--Diagnosis is usually made by serologic testing,
because the organism grows poorly in cell culture media and laboratory
findings are not specific. Primary infection produces a rise in IgM titer
within 2 to 4 weeks of onset of illness and a rise in IgG titer within 6 to
8 weeks. Reinfection may not cause an IgM response, but an IgG increase
occurs earlier than in primary infection. Complement fixation testing is
sensitive but not species-specific. Antibody testing specific for C
pneumoniae, rather than general chlamydial testing, should be requested.9
(Reference)

Therapy
   The main problem for physicians has been to differentiate typical
bacterial from atypical community-acquired pneumonia. The distinction is
particularly important because of therapeutic implications.
   Beta-lactam antibiotics have been used most often for typical
community-acquired pneumonia, and doxycycline or erythromycin is used if
the probable clinical diagnosis is an atypical pneumonia. If a case could
not be established as typical or atypical pneumonia, doxycycline or
erythromycin was added to the beta-lactam regimen.3,7 (Reference)
Monotherapy is highly desirable, since adding a second antibiotic greatly
increases the cost of treatment as well as the risk of side effects and
drug resistance.
   Fluoroquinolones have been suggested as monotherapy for
community-acquired pneumonia. However, some investigators have voiced
reservations regarding coverage against activity of S pneumoniae as well as
Legionella and Mycoplasma species. Ofloxacin (Floxin) is the most active
fluoroquinolone against S pneumoniae and is also effective clinically
against Legionella and Mycoplasma species.10,11 (Reference) In addition, it
is the least expensive fluoroquinolone and is available in both intravenous
and oral forms. For these reasons, at Winthrop-University Hospital,
Mineola, New York, we use ofloxacin as the first-choice fluoroquinolone for
respiratory infection and as monotherapy for typical and atypical
community-acquired pneumonia. Further savings may be possible by switching
from intravenous therapy to oral administration after 3 days.
   Switching from intravenous to oral therapy may also be accomplished with
azithromycin (Zithromax) or doxycycline. Azithromycin has the advantage of
providing 2 weeks' worth of therapy with only 5 days' worth of medication,
because drug levels in blood and tissue are so prolonged. After the initial
loading dose of 500 mg, only a single 25-mg capsule daily for 4 days is
required. It is more expensive than erythromycin but causes fewer
gastrointestinal side effects. However, azithromycin is not yet available
in parenteral form.
   Doxycycline has excellent bioavailability, making it an ideal agent for
transfer from intravenous to oral therapy. It is relatively inexpensive and
is the most cost-effective form of monotherapy for community-acquired
pneumonia. It has a high degree of activity against both typical and
atypical pathogens. If properly diluted, doxycycline is not associated with
phlebitis, and if taken with food, it causes few if any gastrointestinal
side effects.

Summary
   In atypical pneumonia, causative organisms are difficult to isolate, so
careful clinical assessment is essential in arriving at a working
diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis through serologic testing is usually
retrospective. Either a high initial titer or a fourfold or greater rise
between the acute and convalescent titer is considered diagnostic in a
patient with compatible illness. Legionella and mycoplasma organisms may be
cultured from respiratory secretions if plated on appropriate culture
media. Using a syndromic approach, physicians can almost always
differentiate typical from atypical community-acquired pneumonia and narrow
diagnostic possibilities among the atypical pathogens, making possible
institution of early, possibly lifesaving, empirical therapy.

Preview
   Community-acquired pneumonia can now be treated by selecting a single
antibiotic that is active against both typical and atypical pulmonary
pathogens. In the past, it was necessary to use two agents if the type of
pathogen could not be determined. In this article, Dr Cunha discusses his
approach to management using cost-effective monotherapy that can be started
intravenously and then switched to the oral route.

   Community-acquired pneumonia is a frequent problem in the ambulatory and
hospital setting. The common respiratory pathogens are usually responsible
(see box on page 110).1-4 (Reference)

Factors in antibiotic selection
   The main difficulty presented by community-acquired pneumonia is
selection of a cost-effective antibiotic regimen.5-7 (Reference) Today, in
the managed care era, cost-effectiveness is second only to antibiotic
efficacy as a consideration in the selection process. A corollary implied
by the concept of cost-effective treatment is that intravenous therapy must
be switched to oral therapy as soon as possible to maximize cost savings in
hospital patients.
   The most important factor in the empirical selection of an antibiotic is
proven effectiveness in vivo. The antibiotic should readily penetrate
bronchopulmonary secretions and be pharmacologically active at the site of
infection. Virtually all antibiotics used for pulmonary infections show
good penetration of the lungs. Aminoglycosides, for example, concentrate
well in the lung but are less active at the site of infection, where there
is local hypoxia, acidosis, and white blood cell debris.
   The antibiotic chosen should have an appropriate spectrum of activity.
Optimal coverage should be provided for the usual respiratory pathogens,
but unnecessary coverage of every possible pulmonary pathogen should be
avoided. The expensive and potentially harmful practice of ``adding
coverage'' results from an underappreciation of the potential for pathogen
resistance. The wasteful custom of adding antibiotics for unneeded
``gram-negative'' coverage also has important implications in the
development of resistant organisms in an institution, particularly in
intensive care areas.
   If the proper antibiotic monotherapy has been selected, there is no need
to add anything.5-9 (Reference) For example, doxycycline may be chosen for
initial empirical monotherapy. This agent is active against all relevant
gram-negative pulmonary pathogens, such as ampicillin-sensitive and
ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis, and oral anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides
melaninogenicus). Doxycycline is also effective against
penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains of Streptococcus
pneumoniae as well as all atypical organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Mycoplasma and Legionella species).10 (Reference) The only gram-negative
organism not covered by doxycycline is klebsiella, which is uncommon as a
cause of pneumonia in the general population. If this organism is suspected
clinically, another agent, such as a fluoroquinolone or a cephalosporin,
should be selected5,7,9 (Reference) (table 1).
   When typical and atypical organisms cannot be differentiated, clinicians
often elect to protect against both by using double-drug coverage. Although
coinfection is rare, a few patients have both pulmonary and extrapulmonary
findings, and double coverage is reasonable in these cases. Fortunately,
with the advent of intravenous-to-oral ``switch'' therapy (see the later
discussion), double coverage, which is not cost-effective, is almost never
necessary if the right single agent (ie, doxycycline, ofloxacin [Floxin],
or azithromycin [Zithromax]) is selected. These three antibiotics are
effective against all of the common typical and atypical pathogens that
cause community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing a second antibiotic for
additional gram-negative coverage is expensive and unnecessary.
   Although a number of factors are very important prognostically, they
have no bearing on selection of an antibiotic for community-acquired
pneumonia.3,7 (Reference) (The author acknowledges that this is at variance
with the American Thoracic Society's approach.) These factors include age
of the patient, severity of illness, host defense status, potential for
beta-lactamase-producing organisms, and site of infection acquisition
(table 2). For example, pneumococcal infection is treated the same way in
young as in old adults, even though there are differences in prognosis.
Similarly, community-acquired pneumonia in a non-leukopenic cancer patient
is caused by the same pathogens as in a normal host and needs the same
coverage.

Choosing an oral antibiotic
   Because most beta-lactam agents are active against the usual pathogens,
there are many parenteral antibiotics for treating community-acquired
pneumonia. The choice among oral antibiotics, however, is restricted. Oral
penicillin, for example, is ineffective against ampicillin-resistant H
influenzae, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Klebsiella species, M
catarrhalis, and all of the atypical pathogens. Its other disadvantages
include poor oral absorption and only moderate bioavailability, not to
mention the inconvenience of dosing four times a day. Amoxicillin (Amoxil,
Wymox) is given three times a day and has good bioavailability, but it
lacks activity against H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and all atypical
pathogens. Newer oral cephalosporins may be given less frequently and have
enhanced activity against H influenzae, but they are more costly and miss
atypical pathogens. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (Bactrim,
Cotrim, Septra) is an ideal oral antibiotic unless the patient is allergic
to sulfa drugs, but it is suboptimal for community-acquired pneumonia
because of its lack of anti-klebsiella and antistreptococcal activity. The
commonly used erythromycin has limited activity against streptococci, H
influenzae, M catarrhalis, and Klebsiella species and is also an
unsatisfactory choice because of poor bioavailability, short half-life, and
gastrointestinal side effects. It is active against most atypical
pathogens. Penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae often is also
erythromycin-resistant.
   While many antibiotics have been used successfully to treat
community-acquired pneumonias, the three best antibiotics in terms of
spectrum, bioavailability, safety profile, and cost are ofloxacin,
doxycycline, and azithromycin (table 3). These antibiotics permit optimal
monotherapy of community-acquired pneumonias, which has tremendous
cost-saving implications.7 (Reference)
   Because community-acquired pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens has
clinically distinguishable features, specific rather than empirical therapy
is possible. For example, group A streptococcal pneumonia is characterized
by a large pleural effusion in addition to infiltrates; Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia rapidly cavitates in 1 to 2 days; and klebsiella
pneumonia, which is usually in the upper lobe, cavitates after 3 to 5 days.
In these circumstances, an antistaphylococcal cephalosporin would be
recommended as the initial antibiotic selection.4,5 (Reference)

Inpatient versus outpatient therapy
   Traditionally, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia is based
on how ill the patient is as well as on the need for intravenous therapy.
As intravenous-to-oral switch therapy and oral therapy alone become more
widely accepted, the rationale for intravenous therapy diminishes.
Critically ill patients requiring ventilatory support will always need
hospitalization. These patients are likely to be given intravenous therapy
initially and then switched to oral therapy as soon as possible.
   When it is generally realized that antibiotics with excellent
bioavailability are equally effective intravenously or orally, oral therapy
will become the standard of care. Third-party payers also need to recognize
that oral antibiotic therapy in the hospital saves money and that the cost
should be reimbursed.7,11,12 (Reference)

Intravenous-to-oral switch therapy
   Without compromising clinical effectiveness, oral antibiotics that are
well absorbed achieve essentially the same blood and tissue levels as such
intravenous drugs as fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, clindamycin (Cleocin),
and chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin). Only a few antibiotics that have an
appropriate spectrum for community-acquired pneumonias are available for
both intravenous and oral use. Ofloxacin is unique among fluoroquinolones
in being most active against Chlamydia species and, like other
fluoroquinolones, is also effective against Legionella and Mycoplasma
species.11 (Reference)
   The therapeutic approach we use at Winthrop-University Hospital,
Mineola, New York, is outlined in table 4. We begin intravenous therapy
with ofloxacin, 400 mg every 12 hours, and after 72 hours switch to oral
ofloxacin therapy, 400 mg every 12 hours. Patients who are unable to take
medications orally or who improve slowly may need intravenous therapy for
more than 3 days.
   Doxycycline and azithromycin are also ideal agents for empirical
monotherapy of community-acquired pneumonias and are most cost-effective
when given as part of an intravenous-to-oral switch program. Ofloxacin is
our preferred respiratory fluoroquinolone because of its high degree of
activity against S pneumoniae and, as was mentioned, Chlamydia, Legionella,
and Mycoplasma species. Furthermore, it is the least expensive
fluoroquinolone currently available.12 (Reference)
Theoretically, ofloxacin eliminates bacteria in a concentration-dependent
fashion and works optimally as a single 800-mg daily dose.* Recently, it
has been shown that oral administration of 400 mg of ofloxacin once daily
is as effective as and less expensive than 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
twice daily for moderate to severe infections, including community-acquired
pneumonia.12 (Reference)

Determining costs
   As noted, the most effective cost-cutting measure in managing
community-acquired pneumonia is making a change from intravenous to oral
antibiotic therapy as soon as clinically possible. For example, TMP-SMZ
costs $72 a day when given intravenously but only $0.75 a day orally.
Similarly, ciprofloxacin costs $74 a day intravenously and $5.68 a day
orally (table 5).
   Determining the true cost of antibiotic therapy to an institution is
complex, and it is not simply based on an accounting of pharmacy
acquisition costs. Hidden expenses include the administrative costs per
dose, cost of side effects, cost of monitoring antibiotic therapy, and cost
of measures to control outbreaks by resistant organisms. The total cost of
antibiotic therapy, therefore, is the sum of the charges for all these
factors.5-8 (Reference)

Summary
   At present, three antibiotics (doxycycline, ofloxacin [Floxin], and
azithromycin [Zithromax]) provide optimal therapy for both typical and
atypical community-acquired pneumonias. These agents permit a
monotherapeutic approach and are also ideal for intravenous-to-oral switch
therapy, which results in great cost savings for an institution and an
earlier discharge for the patient.
   The era of oral therapy has been ushered in because of economic
imperatives. Fortunately, bioavailability of these three antibiotics is
essentially the same when administered intravenously or orally. Moderately
to severely ill patients may be safely and effectively treated via the oral
route alone; however, most patients who require admission to the hospital
are initially given intravenous therapy, after which a change is made to an
oral antibiotic equivalent as soon as possible.13 (Reference)

Which pathogens are the culprits in community-acquired pneumonia?
   Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of
community-acquired pneumonias, but Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma and Legionella species are
important also. Community-acquired pneumonias due to Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus are seen less frequently
and are usually associated with specific population subgroups. For example,
S aureus pneumonia occurs almost entirely in diabetic patients or in those
who have had viral influenza. Similarly, community-acquired pneumonias due
to K pneumoniae are seen primarily in alcoholics and, less commonly, in
nursing home patients.

DELAYED RESOLUTION OF PNEUMONIA: WHEN IS SLOW HEALING TOO SLOW?

By:
Hugh Cassiere, MD
John C. Rodrigues, MD
Alan M. Fein, MD

Preview
   Some cases of pneumonia can be expected to respond slowly to treatment.
For example, resolution of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in an
85-year-old patient who smokes and has heart disease, diabetes, and
multilobar infiltrates is much more likely to be prolonged than is
mycoplasmal pneumonia in a 25-year-old, healthy, nonsmoking patient with a
unilobar infiltrate. The authors describe risk factors for and causes of
delayed resolution and present a workup strategy for cases that do not
respond within expected time limits.

   Community-acquired pneumonia is seen often by primary care physicians in
their daily practice, but in as many as half of cases, the causative
pathogen remains unidentified even after extensive initial diagnostic
testing. Recently published guidelines of the American Thoracic Society1
(Reference) recommend a more limited initial workup than has been used
traditionally and empirical antibiotic therapy aimed at the most common and
probable pathogens in a given patient. Although this approach is likely to
prove cost-effective, it might not work in all situations. When it is used,
clinical response must be diligently evaluated so patients who are
responding slowly or not at all are identified promptly.

When is resolution considered delayed?
   Most often, pneumonia responds to antibiotic therapy, with patients
experiencing gradual resolution of symptoms (eg, cough, sputum production,
fever, shortness of breath). However, in some cases pneumonia resolves more
slowly than expected or fails to resolve. The length of time that is
considered normal for resolution is estimated on the basis of the natural
history of the common pneumonias. In evaluating resolution, two fairly
distinct parameters are used: symptomatic improvement and radiologic
clearing of infiltrates.
   Symptom resolution--If a patient's condition is responding appropriately
to therapy, improvement in clinical findings is usually noted within 48 to
72 hours.1 (Reference)Thus, if fever or leukocytosis, for example,
persists for 48 to 96 hours, resolution of the pneumonia may be considered
delayed. Empirical therapy, chosen on the basis of symptoms, should not be
changed until 72 hours have passed unless clinical deterioration is
identified. Clinical deterioration may result from treatment failure or one
of many possible causes, discussed later.
   Radiologic resolution--In most infectious processes, radiologic
resolution lags behind symptomatic improvement. In general, patients who
have some response to therapy but persistent symptoms or radiologic
abnormalities beyond the expected limits of resolution are considered to
have slowly resolving pneumonia. For example, Kirtland and Winterbauer2
(Reference) defined slowly resolving pneumonia as symptomatic improvement
but less than 50% radiologic clearing after 4 weeks of therapy.
Nonresolving pneumonia shows little or no clinical improvement or
radiologic clearing after 4 weeks.
   Radiologic deterioration during therapy for community-acquired pneumonia
is common. However, a change in antibiotic coverage or initiation of an
extensive diagnostic workup is not necessary unless clinical deterioration
is also present.

Which coexisting conditions affect resolution of pneumonia?
   When delayed resolution of pneumonia has been established, the first
step in management is to determine whether certain medical conditions
coexist. Conditions shown in table 1 can cause myriad host- defense defects
that impair the body's response to infection.
   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and alcohol abuse are the
most common contributing factors in delayed resolution of pneumonia.
Alcohol's effects on host defenses are complex because coexisting factors,
such as malnutrition, can impair immune function on their own.

What causes delayed resolution of pneumonia?
   When pneumonia caused by a common pathogen fails to respond to therapy,
likely explanations include impaired host response, bacterial resistance
(eg, penicillinase-producing organisms), and inadequate empirical coverage
(eg, staphylococcal pneumonia). Nonresolving pneumonia may also be caused
by an uncommon or resistant pathogen, a noninfectious condition, or a
complication (table 2).
   Common pathogens--The nature of the host response plays a significant
role in resolution of pneumonia; normal resolution is often prolonged in
patients with significant coexisting conditions (eg, diabetes, COPD)
(figure 1).
   For example, in pneumococcal pneumonia (the most common type of
community-acquired pneumonia), half of patients have clear chest
radiographs at 5 weeks; most cases resolve in 8 to 12 weeks. However, the
resolution process is prolonged in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. By 9
weeks, only half of patients have clear chest radiographs, and most cases
are not resolved until 18 weeks have passed. In the study by Jay and
associates,3 (Reference) 60% of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal
pneumonia and coexisting disease still had abnormalities on chest x-ray
films more than 3 months after initiation of therapy. Resolution was even
more prolonged in patients over age 55 who had COPD and alcoholism.
   Mittl and colleagues4 (Reference) found that radiologic clearing of
community-acquired pneumonia was influenced most by age and the number of
lobes involved: Clearing decreased by 20% per decade, and multilobar
involvement cleared more slowly than unilobar involvement.
   Uncommon pathogens--Infection with an uncommon pathogen, such as a
species of Nocardia or Actinomyces, may cause nonresolving pneumonia. In
one study on nonresolving pneumonia, eight patients using long-term
corticosteroid therapy for COPD were found to have opportunistic fungal
infections.5 (Reference) Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage or
transbroncheal biopsy is useful in ruling out such pathogens.
   Noninfectious causes--Conditions that mimic pneumonia but are actually
noninfectious may produce slowly resolving or nonresolving infiltrates.
Some, such as bronchogenic carcinoma (figure 2), may be found during the
diagnostic workup, and others, such as Wegener's granulomatosis (figure 3),
may require open lung biopsy for diagnosis. Congestive heart failure can
produce signs that mimic pneumonia.
   Pulmonary complications--Such complications of pneumonia as abscess,
empyema, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary vascular congestion may delay
resolution of pneumonia. Computed tomography of the chest is helpful in
evaluating patients for these complications.

What is known about the natural history of pneumonia?
   Legionella infection has the longest resolution process of all the
community-acquired pneumonias. Its course is severe and rapidly progressive
and often ends in residual scarring and fibrosis. Its incidence is doubled
in patients who require mechanical ventilation. Macfarlane and associates6
(Reference) noted that only half of patients who have Legionella infection
have radiographic resolution at 10 weeks, and in some, 12 to 20 weeks are
required.
   Mycoplasmal infection is at the other end of the resolution spectrum.
Considered to have the shortest process, mycoplasmal pneumonia usually
resolves completely in 2 to 4 weeks. Residual scarring and fibrosis are
rare.6 (Reference)
   To a large extent, resolution processes of other pathogens that may
result in community-acquired pneumonia are unknown or poorly characterized.
Among these pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, enteric gram-negative
bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia species, Moraxella (Branhamella)
catarrhalis, and certain viruses. Extensive and detailed discussions are
available elsewhere.7,8 (Reference)

How should workup be decided?
   The unfortunate clinical reality is that the causative pathogen remains
unknown in many cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Thus, natural
history patterns are often unhelpful, and all pneumonias end up being
lumped together in the workup process. However, with use of a diagnostic
strategy such as that shown in figure 4, busy physicians can identify and
categorize patients who need further workup and consultation.
   In patients with significant coexisting disease, host-defense impairment
can delay the normal resolution process. Therefore, an early goal is to
differentiate impaired host responses from other causes of slowly resolving
and nonresolving infiltrates. Infiltrates that fail to clear at all over a
4-week period of observation or that take more than 12 weeks to resolve
require further workup. In such cases, uncommon pathogens and noninfectious
mimicking diseases must be ruled out.

Is there a typical presentation?
   At our institution (Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York),
nonresolving pneumonia accounted for 15% of all pulmonary consultations and
10% of all diagnostic bronchoscopies over a recent 2-year period. About 60%
of patients had community-acquired pneumonia that was slow to resolve
because of an impaired host response. About 20% had infection with an
uncommon pathogen (tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
actinomycosis, or cytomegalovirus) and 20% had a noninfectious cause
(Wegener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing
pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, or pulmonary infiltration
eosinophilia).9 (Reference) In our experience, a typical patient with
delayed resolution is an elderly man who has had symptoms for a month or
more before being referred for bronchoscopy.

Summary and conclusion
   Slowly resolving or nonresolving pneumonia is a clinical challenge, but
we believe it can be dealt with in a rational and decisive manner. The
following risk factors have been established for delayed radiographic
resolution of pneumonia and should be considered in patient evaluation:
Coexisting medical conditions
History of smoking
Advanced age
Multilobar involvement
Persistent fever or leukocytosis
Diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, and alcohol
abuse can impair immune function, which slows normal clearing of
infiltrates. Common and uncommon infectious agents, conditions that mimic
pneumonia (eg, a neoplasm, congestive heart failure), and pulmonary
complications (eg, abscess) can also result in delayed resolution.

RADIOGRAPHIC MIMICS OF PNEUMONIA: PULMONARY DISORDERS TO CONSIDER IN
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

By:

Preview
   Pinpointing the source of roentgenographic lung abnormalities can be
challenging because many noninfectious pulmonary disorders mimic pneumonia.
The authors of this article discuss the most common radiographic
presentations of lung disorders that may be mistaken for pneumonia,
including focal and diffuse infiltrates, nodules, cavities, and pleural
effusion. They also outline the role of thorough history taking and
examination in prompt and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary disorders.

   Many organisms can cause serious pneumonias. Early suspicion and prompt
diagnosis and management are essential to minimize morbidity and reduce
mortality. Clinicians often prescribe antibiotics empirically on the basis
of various clinical, radiographic, and laboratory signs of infection (table
1). The choice of antibiotics is influenced by the patient's age, the
presence of comorbid factors, the need for hospital admission, and the
severity of illness. In most patients whose symptoms resolve with
antibiotics, a causative organism is not identified on culture, though
clinical improvement suggests an infectious cause.
   Various noninfectious pulmonary disorders can mimic infectious
pneumonia. When such a disorder is present but is not considered at the
time antibiotics are prescribed, the true source of symptoms and
radiographic abnormalities may remain elusive. Thus, even when infectious
pneumonia is strongly suspected, the possibility of a noninfectious
disorder should always be considered at the time a chest radiograph is
obtained.
   With AIDS more than with any other disease, roentgenographic
abnormalities are thought to signify infection. Radiographic patterns
typical of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia often prompt initiation of
antiprotozoal therapy, with or without corticosteroids. Clinical and
roentgenographic evidence of improvement usually indicates successful
therapy; lack of such improvement raises suspicion of another infection,
usually one caused by an opportunistic organism. ``Drug failures'' and
autopsy findings have made it clear, however, that AIDS patients are prone
to numerous noninfectious pulmonary complications that mimic pneumonia
radiographically, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis and
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (table 2).
   Awareness of the most common radiographic presentations of noninfectious
pulmonary diseases--focal and diffuse infiltrates, nodules, cavities, and
pleural effusion--might lead to a better outcome for all patients with
pulmonary ailments.

Focal infiltrates
   Localized infiltrates are the most commonly recognized roentgenographic
pattern in infectious pneumonia, so it is not surprising that noninfectious
pulmonary disorders that cause a similar pattern are sometimes overlooked.
Clinical signs and symptoms of these noninfectious lung ailments also may
be identical to those of infectious pneumonia. In these circumstances, the
key to correct diagnosis is an accurate history. For example, a history of
smoking in a patient with fever, cough, and radiographic evidence of a
focal infiltrate should raise suspicion of bronchogenic carcinoma. Alveolar
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma may present in this way, with or
without postobstructive infection.
   Noninfectious pulmonary disorders are commonly missed in patients with
congestive heart failure and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. Consider, for example, a patient with cough, shortness of breath,
and a focal infiltrate who is hospitalized and treated with antibiotics for
presumed infection and an increase in diuretic dose. The next day, the
patient feels remarkably better and a chest radiograph demonstrates
clearing of the infiltrate. In such a case, the likely source of the
infiltrate is asymmetric pulmonary edema, not infection. With certain types
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the parenchyma of the lung is
greatly disturbed, resulting in widespread perfusion abnormalities. When
congestive heart failure occurs, edema develops principally in regions
where perfusion is maximized because of ventilation inequalities. The area
where the infiltrate occurs has the best ventilation-perfusion match. This
relationship is compromised by edema that occurs with heart failure, which
leads to cough and shortness of breath.

Diffuse infiltrates
   Many noninfectious disorders are known to cause diffuse pulmonary
infiltrates. Thorough history taking is essential to identify these
diseases early in their course. This is especially true in occupational and
drug-induced lung disease; knowledge of illicit drugs ingested,
particularly poisons, is critical to a good outcome. A misdiagnosis of
infectious pneumonia could obviously delay the benefit of appropriate
treatment, such as an antidote or even lung transplantation, which would be
required for accidental paraquat (herbicide) ingestion.
   Most noninfectious pulmonary disorders responsible for bilateral
infiltrates do not have a known cause and consequently pose a diagnostic
challenge. Diffuse parenchymal disorders are most often mistaken for
infectious disease. Many such disorders are progressive, so prompt
diagnosis and treatment are important. The collagen vascular disorders may
present with fever, productive cough, and marked shortness of breath. They
are usually suspected in patients with a history of either systemic lupus
erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. However, these diseases can present
initially with pulmonary manifestations, which can be a diagnostic
challenge.
   Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a final common pathway for many forms
of severe lung injury and is often overlooked in differential diagnosis of
bilateral diffuse infiltrates. Although its pathogenesis is unknown,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be, in part, immunologic in origin,
resulting from a complex series of cellular and biochemical events.
Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may help to control the
disease process, as is true with many noninfectious pulmonary disorders of
unknown cause that produce bilateral infiltrates. Early diagnosis (usually
by open lung biopsy) is imperative to exclude infectious and malignant
disorders.
   A noninfectious pulmonary disorder that is gaining attention in the
literature is bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). It
has been linked to connective-tissue disease, drug therapy, organ and
marrow transplantation, infection, and toxic fume inhalation. However, it
may occur without known parenchymal insults. Masses of granulation tissue
form in the lumina of small airways and in alveolar ducts, and organizing
pneumonia occurs distal to these obstructions. Figure 1 shows diffuse
infiltrates on the chest radiograph of a 36-year-old woman with BOOP and
lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which were diagnosed on open lung biopsy.
Specific chemotherapy was administered, and dramatic radiographic clearing
of the infiltrates occurred.
   Vasculitic disorders, such as Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss
syndrome, are often mistaken for infectious respiratory diseases.
Confluence of infiltrates on chest radiographs in both alveolar and
interstitial patterns may be observed. Fever, cough, and productive sputum
are often present. Open lung biopsy is required for diagnosis.

Pulmonary nodules
   Far more noninfectious than infectious pulmonary disorders cause diffuse
pulmonary nodules, which range in diameter from about 1 mm to 5 mm. Some
experts classify lesions smaller than 3 cm as nodules and those 3 cm or
larger as masses. Radiographically, nodules appear simply as patchy
consolidation, but careful analysis of the periphery of the lung--where
there is less superimposition of abnormalities--should allow assessment of
the nodular character. Table 3 lists, according to their location on chest
radiographs, noninfectious pulmonary disorders that may present with
multiple pulmonary nodules.
   Noninfectious diseases that have been known to cause nodular development
include allergic alveolitis and sarcoidosis and vasculitic processes, such
as Wegener's granulomatosis. Sarcoidosis and vasculitic disorders may be
particularly elusive early in their course. Extrapulmonary manifestations,
supported by serologic evidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme and
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, may suggest the diagnosis. Lung
biopsy is necessary for confirmation.
   Allergic alveolitis is a hypersensitivity reaction that affects the
parenchyma of the lung. Causative agents are usually organic but may be
reactive inorganic compounds. An increasing number of occupational,
avocational, and even iatrogenic environments are responsible for this
noninfectious disorder. Signs and symptoms resemble those of common
bacterial pneumonia, but a striking preponderance of complaints comes from
patients who are exposed to the offending antigen (eg, dusts, molds) in the
workplace. Flexible bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy reveal
noncaseating granulomas. Cortico-steroids are the treatment of choice.
Ideally, the source of the antigen should be identified, and the patient
should be removed from the offending environment.

Pulmonary cavities
   Parenchymal cavities may be fluid-filled or thick-walled (figure 2) or
possess an air-fluid level (figure 3). Presence of a parenchymal cavity, no
matter what the cause, implies necrosis and tissue breakdown. Cavitary
disease occurs most often with infection, but a number of noninfectious
pulmonary disorders may be overlooked in initial diagnosis.
   When an air-fluid level is not visible in a cavity, a noninfectious
cause should be considered. A history of smoking should raise suspicion of
a bronchogenic carcinoma (eg, squamous cell carcinoma), and if multiple
cavities are present, metastatic cancer from a distant primary site (eg,
head, neck, cervix) should be considered. Wegener's granulomatosis often
presents with multiple cavitary lung nodules. Also, occupational exposure
to coal (pneumoconiosis) by patients with rheumatoid lung disease may
result in Caplan's syndrome and large cavitary nodules. Finally, upper-lobe
cavitary disease in a patient with risk factors for pulmonary
thromboembolism should raise suspicion of pulmonary infarction.

Pleural effusions
   Most pleural effusions occur with a noninfectious disease process.
Nonspecific symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and pleuritic
pain, arise from inflammation of the pleura, compromise of pulmonary
mechanics, or interference with gas exchange. They should prompt
consideration of noninfectious disorders in differential diagnosis.
   Metastatic disease of the pleura is the most common noninfectious cause
of pleural effusions. Carcinoma of the lung and breast and lymphoma account
for about 75% of pleural effusions related to malignant processes. Rarely,
a neoplastic lesion causes occlusion of a large airway, prompting
development of postobstructive infectious pneumonia. Analysis of pleural
fluid obtained by thoracentesis may demonstrate a high percentage of
polymorphonuclear cells, organisms on Gram's stain, or bacterial growth on
culture. Infection may coexist and go unrecognized.
   Collagen vascular diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus
and rheumatoid arthritis, are notorious for their inflammatory nature and
ability to cause exudative pleural effusions. When there is also evidence
of a parenchymal infiltrate, an infectious cause is most often initially
considered. Thoracentesis should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of a
collagen vascular disease (eg, an extremely low glucose level and a low pH,
as found in rheumatoid arthritis) and rule out an associated infection.
   Adverse reactions to drugs produce only a small percentage of all
pleural effusions. A level of suspicion is required so that the offending
medication can be identified and discontinued. Hydralazine hydrochloride
(Apresoline), procainamide hydrochloride (Pronestyl), isoniazid (Nydrazid),
and phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) have been linked to lupuslike symptoms,
including pleuritis. Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin), methysergide maleate
(Sansert), and methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex Dose Pack) may cause
accumulation of pleural fluid and minimal nonspecific signs and symptoms.

Conclusion
   The appearance of any abnormality on a chest radiograph calls for a
complete differential diagnosis, no matter how straightforward a diagnosis
may seem. Noninfectious pulmonary disorders are the most common sources of
radiographic abnormalities. Prompt recognition and timely, appropriate
treatment are essential to minimize morbidity. Because signs and symptoms
of pulmonary disorders are usually nonspecific, a complete history and
thorough physical examination are the best tools for identifying and
managing noninfectious pulmonary disorders.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND BULIMIA NERVOSA: WHEN THE PURSUIT OF BODILY
`PERFECTION' BECOMES A KILLER

By:
Kathryn J. Zerbe, MD

Preview
   The stereotypical picture of an anorexic or bulimic patient as a driven
young woman is no longer valid, if it ever was. The diseases may be
manifest in an athlete who insists on training despite injury, or in a
painfully thin grandmother who thinks she's holding onto her youthful
figure. Most of those affected are too obsessed with their appearance, as
they see it, to realize the medical damage being done. Dr Zerbe describes
behavioral clues to eating disorders and the role of primary care
physicians in intervention.

   Anorexia nervosa and its cousin bulimia nervosa are on the rise in
Western industrial societies and now afflict about 1.2 million young women
in the United States. The morbidity and mortality associated with these
diseases are high; anorexia alone carries a mortality rate of 18% to 20%.
Although lethality in an index year may be 1%, anorexia is often a chronic
condition and the probability of death increases over time.1,2 (Reference)
The death rate for bulimia may be equally high, although, since bulimia was
first described as a syndrome in 1979, long-term studies are only now being
carried out. Both disorders are devastating medically, socially, and
psychologically.

Diagnostic considerations
   A wasted, cachectic appearance is the obvious signifier of anorexia.
Typically, female patients note the lack of menstrual periods for at least
several months. Patients usually place undue emphasis on their appearance
and body image. While others observe that patients look like victims of
starvation, patients insist that they are fat. They may exercise to the
point of exhaustion and diet incessantly to get thinner and thinner. They
talk constantly about food, being fat, and losing weight (table 1) and may
alienate loved ones and health professionals with their relentless pursuit
of bodily ``perfection.'' Their psychological obsession with weight is the
most reliable historical guideline in helping rule out other medical causes
of cachexia, such as cancer, infection (eg, AIDS), or hyperthyroidism.
   Making the diagnosis of bulimia is trickier. Patients can be
underweight, normal weight, or overweight and still engage in binge eating
and purging, and they often keep bulimic symptoms secret. To fulfill
diagnostic criteria of bulimia, patients must eat excessively with an
accompanying sense of loss of control and attempt to compensate with such
measures as vomiting, excessive exercise, and misuse of laxatives to
prevent weight gain (table 2).
   Also preoccupied with weight, appearance, and body image, bulimic
patients may seek out physicians for ``help with their diet'' or for
medications to help them lose weight. Even when physicians have a high
index of suspicion and ask patients if they are bingeing or are purging by
vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, or misuse of insulin or thyroid
medication, patients may not tell the truth. Bulimic behaviors occur on a
continuum, from a few times a month to several times a day. Studies suggest
that as many as 17% of college-aged women engage in bulimic behaviors.3,4
(Reference)
   No single cause has been found for either anorexia or bulimia. The
spectrum of symptoms is generally conceded to result from an amalgam of
emotional, physical, sociologic, and family factors, and recent analyses
support the hypothesis that in some cases they may be genetically based.5
(Reference) From a clinical perspective, it is wise to stress to patients
and their families that these disorders represent a common end point of
some type of emotional turmoil. Because eating disorders are often
accompanied by depression, anxiety disorders (especially
obsessive-compulsive traits), and personality disorders, diagnosis and
treatment may be complex. The presence of comorbid conditions significantly
impacts prognosis and must be recognized for treatment to be effective.

Special populations
   Once believed to be afflictions of female adolescents and young adults,
eating disorders are increasingly seen in both sexes over the course of the
entire life cycle. In addition, they are now being found more often than
they were in earlier decades, in special populations, and in all
socioeconomic and cultural groups.
   Infants and children--Like adults who have gotten the media message that
a thin body is desirable in women and a muscular build is desirable in men,
young children have been influenced by the sociologic shift toward
overvaluing appearance as a measure of personal worth. Eating disorders are
being seen at a growing rate in young children.6-8 (Reference)
   Sometimes failure among infants to gain weight and to thrive is called
``infantile anorexia nervosa,'' but the roots of this problem are
distinctly different from the obsessive emphasis on thinness and the
disordered body image of children, adolescents, and adults with anorexia.
Common contributors to this condition are a rift in the parents'
relationship with each other or psychological difficulties of a parent.
Occasionally, an infant or child loses weight or refuses food after an
incident of choking or a painful diagnostic procedure (eg, suctioning).
   In childhood anorexia, a common and important cause is unwitting
introduction of disturbed attitudes about food by mothers who themselves
have an eating disorder or are preoccupied with weight and appearance.
Sometimes, parents insist that children be placed on a diet or even
withhold food during the years of most rapid growth. Occasionally, parents
request diet pills for chubby youngsters, unaware that increasing activity
and establishing appropriate eating habits are the best tools to prevent
later obesity. These parents must be instructed about the potential of
inducing eating disorders in their children.
   Males--One in every ten patients with an eating disorder is male. Young
men who participate in seasonal sports that specify a particular weight
(eg, wrestling) or that stress appearance and body build (eg, running,
skating) are at special risk. In addition, physicians should be aware of
the increased incidence of eating disorders in the male homosexual
population,9 (Reference) which may be first noted by excessive exercise and
relentless attempts to maintain a slender physique.
   Some research suggests that male patients with eating disorders have a
high incidence of substance abuse. This behavior appears to be part of an
impulse-control problem, in which alcohol, drugs, and food are misused to
calm emotional storms.
   Athletes--Young women and men who participate in dance, gymnastics,
running, rowing, or other sports that emphasize thinness and appearance are
at special risk for anorexia and bulimia. Coaches or teammates may note
progressive weight loss in an athlete or may report the smell of vomitus in
the locker room. Athletes may confide that their sport is their life and
that they feel driven to achieve at any cost.10 (Reference) Primary care
physicians can help athletes, coaches, and parents see the potential for
disaster if this fixation with an athletic identity persists despite
negative consequences.
   Some people use a high level of physical activity in an almost medicinal
way to combat depression (through endorphin ``highs''). Many anorexic
patients misuse exercise; they expend enormous amounts of energy by staying
in almost constant motion (eg, fidgeting, running in place). Often they can
be stopped from doing so only by admission to the hospital for continuous
bed rest and observation. Thus, compulsive exercise may accompany a bona
fide eating disorder or be analogous to it. Such ``activity disorders'' may
account for the addiction to exercise that some patients experience; for
example, they exercise excessively despite exhaustion, multiple injuries,
and warnings from physicians and coaches to stop.10 (Reference)
   older women--Eating disorders are not uncommonly seen in women in their
fourth through eighth decades.11 (Reference) Some women have harbored a
distorted body image since youth but could bring themselves to seek out
treatment only at mid life, when daughters, nieces, or granddaughters were
recognized to also have an eating disorder. More often, women begin to
experience long-term physical side effects of the eating disorder (table 3)
and recognize the negative influence it has had on their social and work
lives. Often, they have kept their eating problems a secret for years and
confess their struggles to their physician with much guilt and shame.
   In the elderly, anorexia must be differentiated from major depression
with melancholia. Depressed patients may have the delusional belief that
food is poisonous. Somatic delusions about the body (eg, ``I cannot eat
because I do not possess a stomach'') arise when primary depression has not
been adequately diagnosed or treated. In contrast, elderly anorexic
patients may be preoccupied with losses sustained during their lifetime or
a need to maintain a youthful figure as long as possible. Treatment methods
for elderly, delusional, depressed patients range from carefully regulated
antidepressant and antipsychotic medications to electroconvulsive therapy.
The latter treatment is particularly effective in elderly patients who are
medically compromised and imminently suicidal. Response of older anorexic
patients to psychotherapeutic intervention is best after nutritional
difficulties have been corrected.

Sexual abuse
   Recent studies suggest that a significant number of patients with eating
disorders have a past or present history of physical and sexual abuse.12,13
(Reference) Eating disorders in adolescents or young adults should prompt a
suspicion that normal intergenerational boundaries in the home may have
been breached. Traditionally, fathers, grandfathers, and uncles have been
suspected as the perpetrators of violence leading to eating disorders.
However, recent studies suggest that maternal incest may be a
little-recognized factor.
   Women who have been the victims of rape may attempt to cope with the
trauma by restricting their eating or purging after a meal. These women
often feel significant shame about what has happened to them and are more
likely to turn to their primary care physician than to a mental health
provider for support and understanding.

Medical complications
   Medical complications of anorexia and bulimia can affect all of the body
systems (table 3).
   In patients with anorexia, physical examination often reveals
bradycardia, hypotension with systolic blood pressure as low as 70 mm Hg,
and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Replenishing circulatory volume in
the feeding process can precipitate congestive heart failure. Anorexic
patients have an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and mitral
valve prolapse. Death occurring after long-term anorexia is likely to have
a cardiac cause and may be sudden and unexpected.14 (Reference)
   In patients with bulimia, cardiac and electrolyte disturbances secondary
to vomiting or to laxative or enema abuse are common. Most authorities
stress that serum magnesium and potassium levels be routinely monitored in
bulimic patients12 (Reference); however, sudden death has occurred even
after cardiac status and electrolyte levels have been routinely monitored
and found to be normal.
   The most common medical complications of bulimia are parotid gland
hypertrophy, dental caries, and erosion of tooth enamel. Enamel can become
eroded from the acidic effects of gastric contents in only a few months of
vomiting. Patients who cannot refrain from purging may be urged to rinse
the mouth with a neutralizing agent, such as sodium bicarbonate or tap
water. In addition, bulimia can lead to esophageal or gastric rupture.
Excessive laxative use may damage the mesenteric plexus of the intestinal
wall and cause persistent loss of bowel activity. Chronic pancreatitis,
although rare, has also resulted from bulimia.

Treatment considerations
   Most important, patients must be educated that their eating disorder has
significant medical complications. Before underlying psychological issues
can be tackled, patients need to be stabilized medically. For a significant
minority of patients, hospitalization is necessary, and because the eating
disorder may be so entrenched, a psychiatrist or psychologist must be
consulted.3 (Reference)
No pharmacologic agent has been found to be a panacea for either anorexia
or bulimia.15-17 (Reference) Some recent studies suggest that fluoxetine
hydrochloride (Prozac) in daily doses of 60 mg lessens the number of binge
episodes and the dysphoria accompanying bulimia. Fluoxetine has had
ameliorative effects in some patients with anorexia; however, it has also
been associated with weight loss in some.
   All anorexic or bulimic patients need psychotherapy to reverse their
entrenched ideas and distorted body image and to achieve other life goals.
Cognitive behavioral interventions and interpersonal therapies have both
been found to be helpful.18 (Reference) Patients should be taught ways to
prevent relapse, such as minimizing exposure to high-risk foods and
developing appropriate additional supportive methods. Other highly
effective techniques involve helping patients challenge negative beliefs
about body size and shape, examine and restructure thoughts about food, and
acquire assertiveness and social skills. Aiding them in developing an
eating pattern that focuses on regular balanced meals, particularly in an
interpersonal or group setting, may also be beneficial.19 (Reference)
Patients learn to replace with companionship the comfort they had received
from food, and they find role models in other people who eat normally
without preoccupation over every morsel, calorie, or new diet technique.
   Studies show that with psychotherapeutic help, as many as 75% of
patients with eating disorders improve significantly over time. Thus, it is
important for physicians to assume a firm, directive approach and to help
patients see the short- and long-term consequences of their disordered
eating. Using food diaries, seeking nutritional counseling, and planning
meals at least a day in advance help counter abnormal eating
behaviors.20,21 (Reference)
   In the case of severe anorexia, enteral or parenteral nutritional
intervention may be necessary. Although such intervention may help patients
temporarily increase their weight so therapy can proceed, it is not without
medical and psychological risks. Some patients react vehemently to having
control taken away, even though they may be near death. Thus, it is
advisable to seek consultation with an eating-disorder specialist in a
tertiary setting, enlist family support whenever possible, and be prepared
to advise temporary commitment for patients in acute jeopardy. After
several weeks, when the starvation state is ameliorated and the nutritional
status normalized, patients become more receptive to psychological work.
Therapy must be paced to enlist patients' strength and motivation in
building an identity less reliant on appearance as the source of
self-esteem and competence.

Summary
   Eating disorders probably result from a combination of emotional,
physical, and sociologic factors and are encouraged by a society that
values appearance as a measure of worth. Once believed to be a problem
largely among young women, the disorders are being found increasingly among
children, young athletes, men, and elderly women.
   Often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and personality disorders,
eating disorders may be difficult to diagnose. Patients with anorexia
nervosa often deny that they have a problem, despite obvious physical
signs. Patients with bulimia nervosa may hide their bingeing and purging
and have no overt signs. Primary care physicians may be the first to
suspect potential problems, including a patient's fixation on food, weight,
dieting, physique, and exercise. Sometimes, patients who have struggled in
silence for years turn to their trusted physician for support and
understanding. The first step in treatment is to address the medical
complications caused by the unhealthy eating habits. Once nutritional
health has been restored, patients need to reverse their entrenched and
distorted body-image ideas through psychotherapy.

TREATING PRURITUS: WHAT'S NEW IN SAFE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS?

By:
Larry E. Millikan, MD

Preview
   Have you ever had poison ivy or another intensely pruritic condition? If
so, you can probably sympathize with sufferers' common cry: ``It's driving
me crazy!'' Unfortunately, few pharmacologic agents have proven to be
routinely effective for pruritus. This article provides an overview of
current therapeutic strategies, including use of a new topical agent.

   Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of pruritus are always
necessary, but prompt relief of pruritus itself is also important.
Discomfort can be considerable. Patients scratch in an effort to relieve
pruritus, but ironically, this may contribute to skin damage, inflammation,
and recurrence. Interruption of the destructive itch-scratch cycle is a
primary goal in treatment of pruritus.

Pruritic conditions
   Pruritus is a common symptom of many dermatologic disorders and several
systemic diseases.1 (Reference) Table 1 summarizes important diagnostic
considerations.
   Xerosis--By far, the most common cause of pruritus without rash is
xerosis, or winter itch. This condition is characterized by moderate to
severe itching of dry, cracked, scaly skin, most often on the lower legs.
Bathing too often, old age, and high temperatures with low humidity can be
causative factors.
   Infestations, bites, infections--Many patients experience moderate to
severe itching during such infestations as scabies or seabather's eruption
(caused by jellyfish larvae) or after insect or other bites (figure 1).
Although these conditions are self-limiting or amenable to pharmacologic
intervention, some form of antipruritic therapy is usually employed for
symptomatic relief.
   Viral exanthems (eg, varicella), superficial fungal infections, and
occasionally even cutaneous bacterial infections (eg, hot-tub folliculitus)
can cause great discomfort. Again, treatment of the underlying condition is
crucial, but from the patient's standpoint, so is relief of symptoms.
   Neurogenic disorders--Notalgia paresthetica may cause prickling,
burning, and pruritic sensations in the region supplied by the lumbar
nerves.
   Inflammatory disorders--Intense, unrelenting pruritus is the hallmark of
several chronic cutaneous inflammatory disorders, ranging from atopic
dermatitis to urticaria (figure 2). Historically, the terms ``eczema,''
``dermatitis,'' and ``eczematous dermatitis'' have been used to describe
the final common expression of various conditions, such as contact
dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, nummular eczema,
and dyshidrotic eczema.2 (Reference) Other commonly encountered pruritic
inflammatory skin diseases include lichen planus, nodular prurigo, and
dermatitis herpetiformis. Patients with psoriasis may also be troubled by
pruritus.
   From the patient's perspective, the intensity of the pruritus determines
how severe he or she considers the dermatitis to be. Often, pruritic
dermatitis elicits repetitive scratching, which leads to excoriations
followed by opportunistic infections, hyperkeratotic skin changes, and
lichenification.1-3 (Reference)
   Contact dermatitis--Accounting for up to 40% of all occupational
illnesses,3 (Reference) contact dermatitis consists of two types: irritant
and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by a direct toxic
effect on the skin. Implicated substances include cosmetics, industrial
chemicals, cleansers, and lubricants. Allergic contact dermatitis results
from a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to substances found in plants (eg,
poison ivy), rubber, wool, nickel, or topically applied drugs (eg,
``caine''-type anesthetics).
   Atopic dermatitis--Up to 5% of children under age 7 experience atopic
dermatitis (figure 3), and more than 90% outgrow the disease by
adolescence. The etiology of this condition is unknown. There is an
apparent genetic predisposition that can be exacerbated by such external
factors as food allergy, irritating clothing, dry air, and emotional
stress. Patients tend to have a personal or family history of asthma,
seasonal or perennial rhinitis, and various allergies.
   Pruritus is the most distressing and prominent symptom of atopic
dermatitis. Many physicians feel that pruritus may be the primary or
initiating event in a flare-up of atopic dermatitis and that rubbing and
scratching damage the skin and induce inflammatory lesions. Acute flare-ups
are generally followed by long quiescent periods. In infants, atopic
dermatitis manifests as intensely pruritic lesions on the head and extensor
areas. In older children and adults, the flexural folds are more often
affected4 (Reference) (figure 4).
   Lichen simplex chronicus--In this localized disorder, repeated
scratching leads to a patch of chronic dermatitis that subsequently becomes
lichenified and takes on a thickened, barklike appearance (figure 5). The
patches of lichenified skin are intensely pruritic, leading to perpetuation
of the itch-scratch cycle.
   Lichen simplex chronicus seems to be precipitated by stress, depression,
and frustration. Some patients have a history of emotional or psychiatric
problems, but most often, the condition begins simply as a nervous habit.
   Nummular eczema--The elderly are most often affected by this form of
eczematous dermatitis. Lesions appear as coin-shaped eczematous plaques,
and pruritus is the primary symptom.
   Dyshidrotic eczema--This condition can be acute or chronic and is
characterized by sudden onset of pruritic vesicles followed by scaling,
fissures, and lichenification.3 (Reference) Dyshidrotic eczema most often
affects the hands (figure 6) and feet.
   Systemic disorders--Several chronic conditions may be characterized by
localized or generalized pruritus, including renal failure, cholecystitis,
cholestasis, diabetes mellitus, mastocytosis, hyperthyroidism,
hypothyroidism, polycythemia vera, iron deficiency, and malignant tumors.
Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to pruritus in these conditions are
ill-defined.1 (Reference)
miscellaneous disorders--Anogenital pruritus (eg, pruritus ani, scroti, and
vulvae) is a relatively common condition that is difficult to treat.
Pruritic patches of lichenified skin are self-perpetuating and may be
secondary to irritant dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, or infection.5
(Reference) Senile pruritus and aquagenic pruritus are idiopathic
conditions. Drug-induced eruptions can also result in bothersome pruritus.

Treatment methods
   Treatment of pruritus is directed at interruption of the destructive
itch-scratch cycle, control of the underlying condition, and relief of
cutaneous inflammation, if present (table 2). The most often prescribed
treatments for pruritus are oral antihistamines and topical
corticosteroids.
   Nonpharmacologic--Although some patients respond to nonpharmacologic
measures (eg, trimming the nails, using cool-water compresses, avoiding
irritants, behavior therapy), pharmacologic intervention is usually
required.
   Localized--Ultraviolet B phototherapy is effective in a wide variety of
pruritic conditions, although it is not very practical for most patients
and physicians.1,6 (Reference) In some situations, intralesional injections
of corticosteroids are useful.
   Systemic--Several classes of orally administered drugs can be effective
in relieving pruritus.
   Antihistamines--Histamine1 (H (subscript) 1) antagonists, such as
diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) and hydroxyzine, are occasionally
beneficial against pruritus. However, this is an untargeted pharmacologic
approach; histamine receptors are blocked in both the central nervous
system and the periphery. As a result, somnolence is a common side effect
with antihistamines and can restrict their daytime use. To minimize these
effects, physicians routinely prescribe low-dose therapy, and whether this
provides adequate cutaneous histamine-receptor blockade to produce
localized antipruritic effects is questionable.
   Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines (terfenadine [Seldane],
astemizole [Hismanal], loratadine [Claritin]) circumvent many of the
central nervous system effects associated with traditional antihistamines,
but studies of their use for pruritus have yielded inconsistent results.7
(Reference) Additionally, terfenadine and astemizole can cause serious
toxicity when given with certain macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin)
and imidazole antifungals (eg, ketoconazole [Nizoral]). Ironically, this
finding has led some to suggest that success with the older agents may be
attributable to their sedative effects rather than to their peripheral
antihistamine properties.
   Corticosteroids--Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone, dexamethasone
[Decadron, Hexadrol]) are used only as a last resort or for temporary
control of a flare. Side effects preclude more extensive use.
   Topical--Several years ago, topical H (subscript) 1-receptor antagonists
were in widespread use. However, the discovery that the compounds were
associated with a high incidence of contact sensitization and
cross-reactivity has all but eliminated their use in dermatology.1,2
(Reference) Several of these agents (topical ``caine''-type anesthetics and
topical antihistamines) are still available, but their use should be
avoided. Several topical agents that are safer and more effective are now
available.
   Corticosteroids--Local application of low- to medium-potency
corticosteroids (eg, hydrocortisone, triamcinolone acetonide [Aristocort,
Flutex, Kenalog]) may be effective in moderately severe cases of
dermatitis. High-potency topical corticosteroids can be used for a short
period for more severe conditions. However, the antipruritic activity of
corticosteroids is secondary to their anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive properties. Even topical corticosteroid therapy can cause
undesirable local and systemic effects.
   In spite of cautions regarding skin atrophy and hypothalamic pituitary
axis suppression, some physicians continue to overuse and misuse topical
corticosteroids for many self-limiting disorders. Many physicians are
inclined, in an effort to provide rapid relief of pruritus, to prescribe
high-potency corticosteroids for conditions that normally respond to
lower-potency analogues. For treatment of pruritic dermatoses, an
antipruritic agent should be combined with the lowest-potency
corticosteroid that controls inflammation. This combination of agents often
provides quick symptomatic relief while maintaining a relatively high
margin of safety.
   Pramoxine formulations--Pramoxine hydrochloride (Itch-X, PrameGel,
Tronothane HCl) is a topical agent that seems to have an important role in
controlling mild to moderate pruritus, although frequent application is
usually required. Pramoxine is often combined with other agents (eg,
menthol, petrolatum, benzyl alcohol) to heighten effectiveness of the
formulation.
   Tricyclic compounds--These agents administered orally, in particular
doxepin hydrochloride (Adapin, Sinequan) and amitriptyline hydrochloride
(Elavil, Endep), have proven to have antipruritic properties in a variety
of conditions, notably chronic urticaria. The exact pharmacologic action
responsible for this effect is unknown but may be, in part, related to
their potent antagonistic properties at histamine-receptor sites. As with H
(subscript) 1 antihistamines, sedation may be problematic, however.
Tricyclic compounds are unique in their ability to block both histamine H
(subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2 receptors. Doxepin's affinity for H
(subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2 receptors exceeds that of other tricyclic
compounds and histamine-receptor antagonists, such as hydroxyzine and
diphenhydramine (which block H (subscript) 1 receptors) and cimetidine
(Tagamet) (which blocks H (subscript) 2 receptors).7-9 (Reference) Other
antipruritic mechanisms of doxepin may include antagonism of alpha
adrenoceptors and muscarinic and serotonin receptors (5-HT (subscript) 2
subtype), inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin neuronal reuptake, and
inhibition of the production of platelet-activating factor.7-13 (Reference)
In addition, orally administered doxepin decreases histamine-induced wheal
reactions.
   Unfortunately, orally administered tricyclic compounds are dose-limited
and poorly tolerated because of their anticholinergic and central nervous
system effects.14 (Reference) Therefore, topical application, which targets
the affected site and causes minimal side effects, is attractive. Solutions
of doxepin and amitriptyline have been shown experimentally to be effective
antipruritic agents.15 (Reference) Recently, 5% doxepin cream (Zonalon) was
introduced for treatment of pruritus. It differs from many other topical
antipruritics in that it has a low potential for sensitization reactions.
In addition, although some systemic absorption can occur, clinical
experience has shown that it is much better tolerated than the oral form of
doxepin.
   In two major clinical trials involving more than 500 patients with
moderate to severe pruritus secondary to eczematous dermatitis, those
treated with doxepin cream (as monotherapy) experienced rapid and
significant relief. Doxepin cream appeared to be equally effective for
atopic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, contact dermatitis, and
nummular eczema.16 (Reference) In a preliminary report,17 (Reference)
doxepin cream was found to be an effective adjuvant to topical
corticosteroids. The only side effects reported were mild, temporary
drowsiness (for 1 to 2 days) and transient, local irritation at the site of
application.
   The possible roles of doxepin cream in treatment algorithms for pruritus
are numerous (table 2). In acute or self-limiting conditions, the agent
could be used instead of a corticosteroid to provide rapid relief as well
as safe and targeted treatment. In chronic conditions, concomitant use of
doxepin cream and topical corticosteroids could have a steroid-sparing
effect by allowing for the use of low-potency corticosteroids or shorter
treatment courses.
   Adjunctive--Emollients are sometimes used as monotherapy in mild
pruritus or as an adjunct in more severe cases. Tar compounds (eg, carbonis
detergens solutions, coal tar emulsions) can be efficacious when used along
with topical corticosteroids but are aesthetically objectionable.

Summary
   In several cutaneous disorders, pruritus is both the primary symptom and
the cause or perpetuating factor. Therefore, one focus of therapy should be
on treating pruritus and thereby preventing or aiding in the resolution of
skin lesions. Several treatment options are available, including
nonpharmacologic methods; use of emollients, tar preparations, and other
topical agents; ultraviolet B therapy; and use of oral antihistamines or
corticosteroids. A new topical tricyclic agent is now available that adds a
promising therapeutic approach.

THE MECHANISMS OF PRURITUS

   Biopsies of eczematous lesions in patients with chronic dermatitis
reveal increased density of nerve fibers and mast cells compared with
normal skin.1,2 (Reference) Studies have also found increased density of
nerve fibers in lichenified skin.3 (Reference) These alterations indicate a
significant primary or compensatory role of mast cells together with C
fibers in the pathophysiology of pruritus caused by dermatitis.
   Pruritic sensations arise from stimulation of nerve endings in the
dermoepidermal junction. They are transmitted as electrical impulses to the
central nervous system along unmyelinated C fibers (figure 1). When C
fibers are stimulated, they release substance P and other putative
neurotransmitters (calcitonin gene-related peptide, somatostatin,
neurokinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and glutamate) into synaptic
junctions at the spinal cord and into the extracellular milieu from
peripheral collateral nerve terminals.4,5 (Reference)
   C fibers often terminate in the skin close to cutaneous mast cells,
which contain potentially pruritic mediators, including histamine. Under
basal conditions, histamine is stored in granules within mast cells; its
release can be caused by various immunologic or nonimmunologic stimuli.
After release, histamine acts on H (subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2
receptors in the skin to stimulate sensory nerve C fibers, cause cutaneous
vasodilation, and increase vascular permeability. These activities produce
pruritus accompanied by erythema and edema.4,5 (Reference)
   Other possible endogenous pruritic mediators are numerous. In general,
these substances can be considered (1) mast cell constituents, (2)
compounds causing pruritus secondary to mast cell stimulation and release
of histamine and other mediators that activate C fibers, or (3) compounds
that directly stimulate C fibers.

ACUTE BRONCHITIS

   Bronchitis is inflammation of the air passages (called the bronchial
tubes or the bronchi) that lead from the windpipe to the lungs. Acute
bronchitis comes on suddenly and lasts a short time. Another type, called
chronic bronchitis, lingers and often gets worse as years go by.

What causes acute bronchitis?
   Very often, what begins as a cold or influenza turns into bronchitis
when the virus spreads to the bronchial tubes. Sometimes the virus
responsible for a childhood disease, such as measles or whooping cough,
causes acute bronchitis at the same time or after the childhood disease has
passed. People whose lungs are already irritated, such as those who smoke,
breathe in a lot of pollution or dust, or have lung disease, are especially
susceptible to bronchitis.

What are the symptoms?
   Persistent coughing that brings up plentiful amounts of phlegm is
probably the most typical symptom. Inflammation makes the bronchial tubes
secrete sticky mucus, which your body tries to get rid of through coughing.
Since this sticky substance blocks the normal flow of air, you may have
trouble getting your breath or you may wheeze (make a whistling sound) when
you breathe. Pain behind your breastbone or in your back, especially when
you cough, is common. So is congestion in your chest and a mild fever.

Do I need to visit a doctor?
   Most times, acute bronchitis takes care of itself in a week or so.
Though it may get tiresome, coughing is nature's way of clearing the
secretions from your lungs, so try not to use cough medicine. If you feel
that you must (for example, to get some sleep), choose an expectorant,
which is a type of medicine that helps loosen the mucus from the bronchial
walls. Drinking lots of fluids thins the mucus and makes it less sticky so
it is easier to cough up.
Keeping the bronchial tubes moist by running a humidifier or taking steamy
showers may help you breathe more easily, and acetaminophen or aspirin
reduces fever.
   Most people start feeling better after following these measures for 3 or
4 days. If you do not improve or if you have a temperature of more than 101
degrees F, blood in the phlegm, or serious trouble breathing, see your
doctor.
If you have repeated attacks of acute bronchitis, mention them to your
doctor. They may lead to chronic bronchitis if not treated.

THE NEED FOR URGENT MANAGEMENT

By:
Joseph Varon, MD Robert E. Fromm Jr, MD, MPH

Preview
   Because hypertension is a common disorder in the United States, primary
care physicians may well see cases of hypertensive crisis. Patients may
present to the office or clinic as well as to the emergency department. In
this article, the authors emphasize the necessity of prompt recognition and
management of severe acute hypertension to limit end-organ damage.

   An estimated 60 million people in the United States have hypertension,
which is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disability and death.1
(Reference) The high prevalence of the condition makes it of great concern
to primary care physicians, who on occasion can expect to see cases of
hypertensive crisis.
   Fortunately, the incidence of hypertensive crises has decreased since
the 1940s, when hypertension was not considered a disease of major clinical
consequence. Indeed, it was viewed by many as an ``essential element'' to
force blood through sclerotic arteries to end-organs. The introduction of
effective pharmacologic treatment in the late 1940s decreased morbidity and
mortality associated with hypertension, and as a result it is currently
estimated that less than 1% of Americans with the condition are likely to
have hypertensive crises.2 (Reference)
   Recognition and management of hypertensive crises may be a challenge to
even the most astute clinician. Unlike the chronic risks conferred by
hypertension, these crises have the potential to be acutely
life-threatening,3,4 (Reference) and inadequate treatment increases both
morbidity and mortality.5 (Reference)

Definitions
   A myriad of terms have been applied to acute elevations in blood
pressure. Unfortunately, definitions have not always been uniform, and the
same clinical presentation may be included under more than one descriptive
heading. The following common definitions are provided to clarify our
subsequent discussions on recognition and management of patients with acute
elevations of blood pressure.
   Hypertensive crises. Situations resulting from elevated blood pressure
that are potentially life-threatening or organ-threatening
   Hypertensive emergencies. Clinical situations in which blood pressure
should be lowered within 1 hour to avoid serious end-organ damage
   Hypertensive urgencies. Elevations of blood pressure that can usually be
treated with antihypertensive agents to reduce pressure within 24 hours of
presentation
   Malignant hypertension. A syndrome characterized by elevated blood
pressure accompanied by encephalopathy or nephropathy or by papilledema
and/or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.4 (Reference) The term
``accelerated hypertension'' has been used to describe acute elevations of
blood pressure with hemorrhages or exudates on funduscopy. These syndromes
do not connote different clinical features or prognoses, and thus the term
``malignant-accelerated hypertension'' has been used.

Causes
   Common causes of hypertensive crises are shown in table 1. Most patients
who present with hypertensive crises have essential hypertension. In these
patients, the most common cause for acute elevation of blood pressure is
withdrawal from an antihypertensive drug (eg, clonidine).1-3 (Reference)

Diagnosis
   Hypertensive crisis is not defined by a specific blood pressure reading;
rather it is a clinical syndrome of end-organ disease that is associated
with acute elevations of blood pressure.5,6 (Reference) As is the case with
many other conditions in clinical practice, the diagnosis depends on the
results of history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing.
After these initial evaluations, patients can be categorized into those
with hypertensive emergencies, those with hypertensive urgencies, and those
without evidence of end-organ damage.
   History taking--The primary focus of history taking in patients with
hypertensive crises is assessment of end-organ dysfunction (table 2). The
physician should obtain historical information on neurologic,
cardiovascular, and renal symptoms. Specific manifestations, such as
headaches, seizures, chest pain, dyspnea, and edema, should be ascertained.
In addition, a history of antihypertensive drug use and withdrawal should
be elicited, because as previously mentioned, abrupt discontinuation of
antihypertensive medications is one of the most common causes of
hypertensive crises.1,6 (Reference)
   Other medication use should also be examined. Prescription and
nonprescription drugs, including sympathomimetic or anticholinergic agents
(eg, decongestants, antidepressants) may produce acute elevations of blood
pressure. Previous and current drug abuse should also be noted; agents such
as amphetamines and cocaine may precipitate hypertensive crises. Some
herbal preparations may also elevate blood pressure.
   Physical examination--As in patients with any other critical illness,
physical examination starts with evaluation of the airway, breathing, and
circulation (ABCs) and is followed by assessment of mental status and level
of consciousness.6 (Reference) Blood pressure is measured in both arms with
a cuff of appropriate size. A standard sphygmomanometer should be used to
verify blood pressure levels in patients with readings outside normal
range. Automatic blood pressure recording devices may be inaccurate and
should not be routinely used when hypertensive crises are suspected.6
   All patients with elevated blood pressure should have a funduscopic
examination to detect papilledema, hemorrhages, or exudates. A careful
cardiovascular examination should be followed by complete neurologic
assessment to identify focal symptoms and signs.
   Laboratory studies--These are guided by the results of history taking
and physical examination. A complete blood cell count, measurement of
electrolytes and blood urea nitrogen, and urinalysis should be considered.
In addition, an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and computed
tomographic scan of the head are obtained in selected patients with
evidence of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurologic changes. It must
be emphasized that in many instances these tests are performed
simultaneously with the initiation of antihypertensive therapy.

Principles of management
   In the successful management of patients with hypertensive crises,
primum non nocere should be the rule. The initial goal of antihypertensive
therapy is not to achieve a normal blood pressure, but rather to gradually
decrease the mean arterial pressure to minimize the risk of hypoperfusion,
particularly in cerebral, coronary, and renal vascular beds.7 (Reference)
   Patients who present with hypertensive emergencies should be considered
critically ill and treated in an intensive care environment.6,8 (Reference)
They are placed at bed rest, and intravenous access is established for
administration of medication and fluid. Continuous blood pressure
monitoring, electrocardiographic readings, and frequent assessments of
neurologic status are routine. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is
achieved by placing intra-arterial lines. When properly applied, this
technique provides the most accurate and most frequently updated blood
pressure information.6,9 (Reference) We recommend intra-arterial line
placement in all patients who receive fast-acting, potent vasodilators (eg,
sodium nitroprusside).
   A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is
to lower the mean arterial pressure by 25% over the initial 2 to 4 hours.1
(Reference) Some investigators recommend decreasing the diastolic blood
pressure to no less than 100 to 110 mm Hg because of the potential for
cerebral and coronary hypoperfusion.2,6 (Reference)

Specific agents
   A number of pharmacologic agents are available in the United States for
the management of hypertensive crises. As mentioned before, the appropriate
therapeutic approach depends on the form and clinical presentation. We
generally recommend short-acting parenteral agents for patients with
hypertensive crises (table 3).
   Sodium nitroprusside--Still one of the most commonly used agents for
hypertensive crises, especially in patients with documented severe,
long-standing chronic hypertension,10 (Reference) sodium nitroprusside
(Nitropress) stimulates the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and
relaxes vascular smooth muscle. The drug is very potent, and cerebral blood
flow may decrease in a dose-dependent manner. Onset of action is within
seconds, with a duration of 1 to 2 minutes and a plasma half-life of 3 to 4
minutes.11 (Reference) Blood pressure may rise abruptly when the drug is
stopped. Sodium nitroprusside is light-sensitive, and the infusion
reservoir should be covered.
   One of the main concerns in using sodium nitroprusside in clinical
practice is that it metabolizes into cyanogen and thiocyanate. Therefore,
in patients with acute or chronic renal failure, cyanide poisoning may
occur after prolonged administration. In most cases, toxic effects occur
after several days of infusion but may be seen within the first 24 hours of
high-dose administration (infusion rates higher than 2 mcg/kg per minute).
   Calcium-channel blockers--These agents have been used worldwide in the
treatment of acute hypertension.12 (Reference)
Nifedipine--Administration of 10 mg of nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) every
5 minutes has been suggested by some investigators as an adequate form of
therapy in patients with hypertensive crises.1,3,4 (Reference) It is
important to mention that nifedipine is not absorbed through the buccal
mucosa and that patients should bite and swallow the medication rather than
use it sublingually.13 (Reference) Nifedipine causes arteriolar
vasodilatation and rapidly reduces systemic vascular resistance. Onset of
action is within 15 minutes of oral administration, and maximum effect
occurs at 30 minutes. A major word of caution: Administration of nifedipine
may precipitate ischemic events by sudden reduction in blood pressure.14
(Reference) In our experience, particular caution should be exercised in
patients with preexisting coronary artery disease.
   Nicardipine hydrochloride--An intravenous form of nicardipine (Cardene
I.V.) has been approved for treatment of acute severe hypertension in the
United States. This agent is a dihydropyridine derivative that differs from
nifedipine by addition of a tertiary amine structure in the ester side
chain. Because this makes nicardipine 100 times more water-soluble than
nifedipine, it can be administered intravenously.15 (Reference) In a recent
paper, Halpern and associates16 (Reference) reported on a multicenter,
prospective, randomized trial comparing the effect of this agent with that
of sodium nitroprusside in patients with severe postoperative hypertension.
They found nicardipine to be as effective as sodium nitroprusside.
   Nicardipine offers some unique advantages in the emergency treatment of
hypertensive crises. For example, it has been shown to reduce both cardiac
and cerebral ischemia.17 (Reference) In addition, its dose is not dependent
on the patient's weight. The manufacturer's recommendation for rapid
control of blood pressure is to give a continuous infusion that starts at 5
mg/hr and increases by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes (maximum, 15 mg/hr) until
the desired reduction in blood pressure is achieved. Oral nicardipine
(Cardene), 20 mg, can also be given for hypertensive urgencies, and its
efficacy is similar to that of nifedipine.18 (Reference)
   Adrenergic-blocking agents--Three adrenergic-blocking agents may be
considered for hypertensive crises: esmolol hydrochloride (Brevibloc),
labetalol hydrochloride (Normodyne, Trandate), and phentolamine
(Regitine).
   Esmolol--This agent is a pure beta-adrenergic blocking agent that has an
extremely short half-life of less than 10 minutes. Esmolol can be
administered both as an intravenous bolus and as an infusion. The
recommended initial dose is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, followed by infusion at 50 to
300 mcg/kg per minute.
   Labetalol--When given intravenously, this blocker of both alpha- and
beta-adrenergic receptors produces a prompt and controlled reduction of
blood pressure in patients with hypertensive crises.2,19 (Reference)
Antihypertensive effects start within 5 minutes of administration and may
last at least 4 to 6 hours. The fall in blood pressure results from a
combined decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a slight fall in
cardiac output. Initial parenteral treatment can be followed by oral
administration. A reasonable intravenous protocol is an initial bolus of
0.25 mg/kg, followed by larger boluses (0.5 mg/kg) every 15 minutes until
either blood pressure is controlled or a total dose of 3.25 mg/kg has been
given.
   Phentolamine--This adrenergic-blocking agent is used for management of
catecholamine-induced hypertensive crises. Intravenous administration of 5-
to 10-mg boluses is recommended.6,20 (Reference) The effect is immediate
and may last up to 15 minutes. Unfortunately, phentolamine may cause
tachyarrhythmias or angina, and its use is contraindicated in patients with
preexisting coronary artery disease. Once blood pressure is under control
with phentolamine, oral phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline), a long-acting
alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, may be given.
   Trimethaphan camsylate--A non-depolarizing ganglionic blocking drug,
trimethaphan (Arfonad) blocks transmission of impulses at the sympathetic
and parasympathetic ganglia.11 (Reference) The initial dose is 0.5 to 1
mg/min by continuous infusion, titrated to therapeutic effect. The agent is
potent and has numerous side effects. Tachyphylaxis is a common occurrence
and usually is seen within the first 2 days of administration.
   Diazoxide--Chemically related to the thiazide diuretics, diazoxide
(Hyperstat IV) directly relaxes the arteriolar smooth muscle and thus
reduces peripheral vascular resistance.21 (Reference) When urgent treatment
is required, diazoxide is given intravenously. The onset of action is
immediate, with peak action at 5 to 10 minutes and total duration of action
ranging from 3 to 18 hours.11 (Reference) The current recommended dose is a
minibolus of 1 to 3 mg/kg (to a maximum 150-mg single dose) injected over
10 to 15 seconds. It was previously believed that larger doses (ie, 300 mg)
were needed for therapeutic effect because this agent is 90% protein-bound.
However, larger doses were associated with severe hypotension in up to 10%
of patients. Diazoxide has other significant side effects that additionally
limit its use; salt and water retention is commonly seen, and hyperglycemia
and hyperuricemia may be significant.
   Clonidine--Oral clonidine (Catapres), 0.1 mg every 20 minutes (to a
maximum of 0.8 mg), has been used for the treatment of hypertensive crises,
particularly hypertensive urgencies.22 (Reference) Oral ``loading'' allows
a smooth, rapid, predictable reduction of blood pressure.23 Sedation is a
common side effect and may be a useful adjunct in some patients. In our
experience, this medication is an excellent choice when blood pressure
control within a few hours is desired.6 (Reference)
   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors--Captopril (Capoten) is the
prototype of these agents and has been compared with several other agents
for treatment of hypertensive crises. In a study by Angeli and
associates,24 (Reference) the effects of sublingual captopril were compared
with those of nifedipine, and it was found that sublingual captopril could
be effectively used as an alternative to nifedipine. The effects of
sublingual captopril occur within 5 minutes of its administration and
persist for about 4 hours.
   Intravenous enalapril maleate (Vasotec I.V.) is now gaining popularity
for use in hypertensive crises.25,26 (Reference) In our experience, initial
intravenous treatment followed by oral administration is a safe means of
management.
   Other agents--A number of other agents are used for hypertensive crises,
including nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid IV, Nitrostat) and hydralazine
hydrochloride (Apresoline). Reserpine (Serpasil), methyldopa (Aldomet), and
guanethidine monosulfate (Ismelin) have largely been replaced by newer
agents and in our experience have no role in current treatment of
hypertensive crises.
   Nitroglycerin--Although nitroglycerin has disadvantages, including
unpredictable antihypertensive effects, it may have a significant role in
patients with coronary artery disease.6 (Reference) It is still widely used
because it is inexpensive when compared with other agents.
   Hydralazine--This agent is an arteriolar vasodilator that is commonly
used in pregnancy-related hypertensive crises. It may cause marked reflex
tachycardia and increase myocardial oxygen demand, which can lead to
anginal symptoms in patients who have preexisting coronary artery disease.

Special diagnostic and treatment situations
   Hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, and myocardial ischemia
present special management considerations in patients with hypertensive
crises.
   Hypertensive encephalopathy--The central nervous system is one target
organ that is damaged by acute elevations in blood pressure. The cerebral
vasculature constricts and dilates as necessary to maintain a relatively
constant level of cerebral blood flow. This process, also known as
autoregulation, protects the brain from changing levels of systemic blood
pressure.27 (Reference) However, significant elevations of blood pressure
overcome the homeostatic process and lead to cerebral hyperperfusion and
the development of cerebral edema. Chronic elevations of blood pressure
shift the entire regulatory curve to the right.
   The manifestations of hypertensive encephalopathy may be those of focal
or diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In the management of this hypertensive
emergency, attention must be paid to the rate of decrease in blood pressure
in order to avoid cerebral ischemic complications. Although drugs such as
clonidine have been used in these patients, we prefer intravenous
titratable agents.6,28 (Reference)
   Aortic dissection--About 80% of patients who develop aortic dissection
have a history of hypertension. The mechanism of aortic dissection involves
not only elevations of blood pressure per se but also pressure waves
associated with the pulsatile waveform of systemic blood pressure.29
(Reference) The rate at which the pressure wave rises is important to the
propagation of aortic dissection and an important factor to consider in its
treatment. Physicians who treat aortic dissection should administer agents
that not only reduce the mean arterial pressure but also reduce the rate at
which pressure rises. Classically, vasodilators have been used with the
addition of beta blockers; more recently, beta blockers with vasodilatory
properties have been advised. Some investigators still advocate the use of
ganglionic-blocking agents for this disorder.
   Myocardial ischemia--Acute elevations of blood pressure may result in an
imbalance between oxygen demand and supply in the coronary circulation and
in the development of ischemia. Thus, in patients with acute myocardial
infarction or unstable angina, acute blood pressure elevations may be
deleterious and should be managed promptly. Nitrates, which have been a
mainstay of therapy for myocardial ischemia for a number of reasons,
including their ability to dilate vessels of the coronary bed, are also
efficacious for the management of hypertension and may have a special place
in the treatment of this syndrome.6 (Reference)

Summary
   Although hypertensive crises are now relatively uncommon, they often are
life-threatening when they do occur and demand early recognition and
management to minimize morbidity and mortality. Most patients have
essential hypertension, and withdrawal from an antihypertensive drug is the
most common cause of acute elevation of blood pressure.
   Short-acting parenteral agents are generally recommended for management
of hypertensive crises. In most patients with hypertensive emergencies, the
mean arterial pressure is lowered 25% over 2 to 4 hours. Both cerebral and
coronary hypoperfusion must be avoided.

FOUL-SMELLING TODDLERS

By:
Rashmi R. Abhyankar, MD, Terre Haute, Indiana

   Toddlers have a tendency to push objects up their nose. When a small
child is brought in for investigation of a foul odor of recent onset,
inspect both of his or her nostrils well and ask if any foreign bodies have
been noted before you make a referral or prescribe antibiotics.
   I have retrieved toilet paper and pieces of foam and sponge from these
patients.

IS IT ULCERATIVE COLITIS?

By:
Monjur Ahmed, MD, Kew Gardens, New York

   Amebic colitis may mimic or precipitate an attack of ulcerative colitis.
Therefore, the stool should be examined for Entamoeba histolytica in any
patient with an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis before prescribing
corticosteroids, which disseminate this organism. The presence of E
histolytica trophozoites in a fresh stool specimen justifies treatment with
metronidazole.

APICAL EXAMINATION FOR LEFT VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT

By:
Arup Achari, MD, Houston

   Precordial examination is often considered less important than an
electrocardiogram (ECG) or a chest film in the evaluation of left
ventricular size and volume. However, an impulse of more than 3 cm in
diameter during palpation of the apex with the patient in the left lateral
decubitus position is 92% as sensitive and 91% as specific as an
echocardiogram in indicating left ventricular enlargement* and is far
superior to the ECG and chest film for this purpose.
   The normal apical impulse covers an area of about 1 cm (the size of a
penny). If the area is more than that of your stethoscope (about 3 cm), you
can be fairly sure that the patient has an enlarged left ventricle.

BURNS FROM DEFIBRILLATION

By:
I. K. Parikh, MD, Cincinnati

   At an advanced cardiac life support meeting I attended at a local
hospital, it was mentioned that a patient was burned during a
defibrillation procedure. This happened because the patient had been
sponged with tepid alcohol to lower his temperature before cardiac arrest
occurred.
