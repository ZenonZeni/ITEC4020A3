<h4>June 1994<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="au">AUSTRALIA</a></h2>
<h4>Tax on benefits extended</h4>

<p>Employers should review their compensation arrangements in the light of the new Fringe Benefits Tax (see <i>Headlines</i> of November 1993). From 1 April 1994, a number of benefits not previously taxable were brought into the FBT net, and all benefits subject to FBT became taxable at a higher rate ---- the top marginal personal rate of 48.4%.  Items now subject to FBT include company cars (at varying rates), parking, travel, club memberships, entertainment, school fees and subsidised loans.

<p>Since FBT is imposed on the provider, not the recipient of the benefit, companies continuing to provide a range of taxable benefits to their employees have become liable to an increase in FBT payments. How this will affect companies will vary, depending on whether companies have introduced flexible compensation arrangements or not. 

<p>Those that have adopted flexible compensation will not be greatly affected because they will automatically pass on the additional FBT to their employees. They may, however, withdraw benefits such as school fees and club memberships since these will no longer provide the employee with a tax saving. The only benefits which will remain attractive to the employee as part of a package are superannuation and company cars, both of which attract substantial tax concessions.

<p>Companies maintaining a traditional compensation approach of salary plus prescribed benefits will, after 1 April 1994, have incurred an increase in their FBT expense. They are likely to respond in a variety of ways. Some will seek to reduce the impact by making major changes to their benefits, either by reducing the range or quality. Others will absorb the additional FBT costs. However, in so doing, they will continue to lose control over their overall compensation costs; as a result, the additional FBT may hasten a move towards total compensation arrangements.

<h4><a name="au2">Budget encourages employee share schemes</a></h4>

<p>Under changes introduced by the May 1994 Federal Budget, employee share acquisition schemes that are available to all employees have become more attractive to employers. Companies may therefore wish to consider providing such schemes. They are now more attractive because the Budget has introduced:

<ul>
<li> an exemption from FBT on the discount (subject to a maximum) offered on the purchase of shares in the employing company
<li>the addition of the discount to the cost base of the shares for tax purposes, so that the discount itself is not counted as a capital gain, and
<li>a tax deduction to the employer for the value of the discount provided.
</ul>

<p>The Budget has also effectively killed off the so-called 'new generation' share schemes being marketed by some financial institutions in Australia. Under the new arrangements, where shares or rights are offered to employees at less than their market value, the discount will be subject to Fringe Benefits Tax, irrespective of any disposal restrictions. This will eliminate the tax deferral advantages previously enjoyed by these plans.

<h4>Global plan completed</h4>

<p>The global plan (see <i>Headlines</i> of February and <a href="9404.html#be">April 1994</a>) has now been confirmed by the Social Law of 30 March 1994. The most important measures are:

<ul>
<li>A wage freeze will be in force from 1994 until 1997; no agreements that would introduce increases in salary or other benefits can be concluded throughout that period (apart from the exceptions described in <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9404.html#be">April 1994</a>).
<li>A special social security contribution has been introduced with effect from 1 January 1994. This replaces the previously announced reduction in family allowances. The level of contribution is related to net taxable income, with a maximum of BF2,000 per month.
<li>With effect from 1 April 1994, all pensions from conventional early retirement programmes will be subject to a social security contribution of 1%. In addition, the Social Law introduces a legal framework for such pensions to apply to part timers as of age 50.
<li>As from 1 January 1995, State and company provided pensions in excess of BF40,000 (for those without dependents) or BF50,000 (for those with dependants) per month or benefits in lieu of such pensions will become subject to a new social security contribution. This will be based on progressive rates, depending on the gross level of the pension and the beneficiary's family charges, up to a maximum rate of 2%.
<li>With effect from 1 April 1994, successive employment contracts of limited duration can be agreed, provided certain conditions are met.
<li>The notice period, in the case of termination by the employer, for certain employees can now be determined by mutual consent and specified in employment contracts. This applies to employees hired after 1 April 1994 with salaries in excess of BF1,782,000 pa. The agreed period cannot, however, be less than the minimum legal notice period. This measure should reduce the financial impact on employers of the generous Belgian termination rules.
</ul>

<h4>Retirement benefit plans gain in popularity</h4>

<p>More companies are sponsoring retirement benefit plans for their employees(48% compared with 42% a year ago), according to Towers Perrin's latest survey of corporate benefit trends. The main reason for this is employers' desire to be competitive with other companies and to limit their exposure to open-ended benefit obligations. This has resulted in both national and multinational companies establishing defined contribution and hybrid type plans.

<p>The survey, which covers 339 companies representing all sectors of the economy, also revealed that 67% of the companies with pension plans provide benefits with a target level of up to 70% of final salary, including social security benefits. In those plans, a defined benefit approach prevails. However, the trend when establishing new plans is to provide defined contribution benefits with a target of 51% to 60% of final salary (including social security benefits).

<p>The other benefits most commonly provided are medical care, meal allowance and group life insurance, with more than 90% of participating companies providing at least one of these benefits. The full pattern of corporate benefit provision is:
<hr>
<pre>Medical care	                97%
Meal allowance	                92
Group life insurance	        91
Short-term disability coverage	79
Employee loans	                68
Prescription medicines	        67
Dental care	                60
Health screening	        59
Pension provision	        48
Retiree programmes	        10</pre>

<h4>Ontario health insurance coverage limited</h4>

<p>After 30 June 1994, employers will need to make arrangements for private health insurance for their foreign employees working in Ontario, as they are no longer eligible for provincially funded health care coverage. The only exception is employees going to Ontario to work temporarily who are issued in advance with an employment authorisation. This will only be given if the employee will be working:

<ul>
<li>for a named Ontario employer
<li>in a specific job, and
<li>for a limited time.
</ul>

<p>However, accompanying family members will not be covered.

<H2><a name="cz">CZECH REPUBLIC</a> </h2>
<h4>Republic follows Hungary's lead on pensions</h4>

<p>As of February 1994, employers can establish supplementary retirement benefit arrangements for their employees in the Czech Republic. This follows from a new law passed by the Czech Parliament, in the wake of Hungary's move in November last year (see <i>Headlines</i> of February 1994). Although there are no tax incentives for these funds, the State will make additional payments to top up an individual's own contributions.
Funds must be established in the form of joint stock companies, with a minimum capital of Kc20m. It is therefore likely that they will be established by banks and insurance companies and will be open to participants on a general basis, rather than by individual employers for their own employees.

<p>Features of these new funds are:

<ul>
<li>They are defined contribution arrangements.
<li>They are open only to permanent residents of the Czech republic overage 18.
<li>Contributions can be paid by any individual (and/or his or her employer on his or her behalf). 
<li>The State will contribute to an individual's account at a rate that depends on the contributions paid by (or for) the individual. The maximum State contribution is Kc120 per month if an individual's contributions are Kc500 per month. The State contribution is increased by 25% after two years' membership.
<li>Benefits can be in the form of pensions or lump sums, payable no earlier than age 50. Withdrawal from the fund 	is allowed (after at least 12 months' participation), but in that case only an individual's own contributions (plus investment return) can be refunded.
<li>Funds can be invested in a fairly wide range of investments including overseas investments, subject to certain requirements on concentration of investments in particular assets.
<li>Funds will be managed by a board of directors of at least five members and will be regulated by the Government, which has power to impose penalties for violation of the requirements.

<h4>Company car tax changes </h4>

<p>New rules concerning the taxation of the benefit of company cars came into force on 1 January 1994. This will ultimately lead to a reduction in the number of company car users. The new tax charges are based on a car's purchase price. For 1994, the charge is 20% of the price, with minimum and maximum prices of DKK150,000 and DKK400,000, respectively.

<p>The taxable charge will increase as follows:

<hr>
<pre>1995	21%
1996	22
1997	23</pre>
<hr>

<p>Different rules apply to company cars that are more than three years old.  Under the previous system, employees had to keep a record of business and private use since taxation was based on the amount of private mileage.  As the new system does not take this into account, company car owners with limited private mileage are likely to pay more tax.

<h4>Sex equalisation policies should be reviewed</h4>

<p>Employers and trustees of retirement benefit plans may need to review their sex equalisation policy, in the light of the Advocate General's Opinion, given on 4 May 1994, in two cases brought before the European Court of Justice (ECJ).

<p>The cases concerned are:

<ul>
<li>Smith v Avdel Systems in the UK, and
<li>van den Akker v Stichting Shell Pensioen fonds in the Netherlands.
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the pension plan had previously had a higher normal pension age for men than for women. To comply with Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, following the Barber judgment of 17 May 1990, both employers had raised the normal pension age for women to that of men. The new pension age applied to benefits for past and future service resulting in reduced benefits for women.

<p>The Advocate General's Opinion is that:

<ul>
<li>Article 119 does not prevent employers raising women's normal pension age to that of men for:
<br>----	future service, and
<br>----	service prior to 17 May 1990, but
<li>for the period of service between 17 May 1990 and the date equalisation is implemented, equalisation requires benefits for both men and women to be based on the lower women's normal pension age.
</ul>

<p>This Opinion relates only to EU law. Any equalisation changes must also take account of any restrictions under domestic contract laws or the legal documents of individual plans.

<H2><a name="jp">JAPAN</a></h2>
<h4>Employee research comes into its own</h4>

<p>A recent Japanese research study showed that only 30% of major foreign affiliates conduct climate surveys, but 80% of those who do believe they are an effective catalyst for change.

<p>The number of employers using such surveys is expected to increase dramatically as companies realise how they can use them strategically to help unblock barriers to change and revitalise their employees in the current recessionary environment.  Conducted independently and confidentially, they can meet a variety of needs:

<ul>
<li>building a case for organisational redesign and 	restructuring
<li>assessing supervisory effectiveness
<li>improving performance appraisal methods and 	techniques
<li>enhancing teamwork
<li>determining training and development needs, and
<li>identifying communications gaps.
</ul>

<p>Successful change in Japan is always consensus-based and surveys can provide hard evidence for Japanese management that action is essential and can help kick-start the process. In a recent Towers Perrin survey of employment practices of 229 US companies in Japan, work force skills/competencies, fair evaluation and performance differentiation were three of the top four HR concerns.

<p>It is essential that employees are given unequivocal feedback and management must be prepared to act on the survey results, even if the resulting actions are spread over a period of time.

<h4>Earnings cap to be imposed</h4>


<p>The Government has announced that, with effect from 1 January 1995,  earnings for calculating social security contributions will be capped. The cap will be set at 12 times the national minimum wage. Relevant legislation is expected to be drafted within 	the next two to three months.

<h4>Labour legislation amended</h4>

<p>As a result of changes concerning redundancy, probationary periods and written employment contracts that came into effect on 1 January 1994, employers now need to review their practices.

<p><b>Redundancy:</b> The previous legislation stipulated that, when employees were made redundant for business reasons (rather than individual performance reasons), they should be selected according to the last-in-first-out principle (LIFO), unless the unions agreed otherwise. The new law allows companies to exempt two 'highly valued' employees from the LIFO list,  thereby enabling them to retain potentially high-flying new recruits, even in difficult economic times.

<p><b>Probationary period:</b> Under the new legislation, employers have the right to insist that employment contracts include an initial probationary period which can be for a maximum of one year. Previously, such periods could only last for a maximum of six months.

<p><b>Employment contracts:</b> Employers now have to inform new employees (ie those hired after 1 January 1994) of their employment terms and conditions within one month of the employment agreement being concluded. The information must be in writing and cover a number of specific terms. 

<p>In addition, employees hired before 1 January 1994 have the right to request a written contract. All relevant information must be forwarded to employees within two months of them having requested it. Previously, there was no obligation on the part of employers to provide a written employment contract, although most employees did receive some kind of written confirmation of their employment terms. However, these may not meet the new statutory requirements.

<h4>Maternity benefits improved</h4>

<p>Under the requirements of the EU's Maternity Rights Directive, employers have extended obligations to provide improved maternity benefits. The new arrangements will apply to women expecting a baby on or after 16 October 1994. The main changes are:

<ul>
<li>the higher rate of statutory maternity pay (SMP) (90% of average earnings for six weeks and £52.50 for a further 12 weeks) will, in future, have to be paid to women who have at least 26 weeks' continuous service in the same job. Previously, this rate applied only after two years' service. 
<li>women on sick leave for a reason unrelated to their pregnancy will be entitled to statutory sick pay until they begin their maternity leave.
<li>State maternity allowance will be increased (from £44.55 to £52.50 per week) for eligible women who do not qualify for SMP.
</ul>

<p>The Government plans to claw back the estimated £55m cost of the new arrangements by reducing, from 100% to 92%, the amount of SMP reimbursed to employers, with effect from 4 September 1994. Employers who pay £20,000 or less a year in national insurance contributions will continue to be fully reimbursed for SMP.

<h4><a name="uk2">Expatriates to be taxed on share options</a></h4>

<p>The Inland Revenue has announced that employees who work abroad and who exercise share options granted by their UK employers are no longer exempt from tax on the benefit. They are liable for tax at their marginal rate on the value of the gain. Similarly, foreign nationals who are granted share options while tax-resident in the UK are also liable for tax, even if they have ceased to reside in the UK when the option is exercised. 	The new rules apply to options exercised after 6 April 1994.

<p>The change in practice has come about because the Revenue has changed its definition of 'emoluments' which qualify for a foreign earnings deduction. Previously, this term was deemed to include the gain from share options, granted by an employer, outside an approved employee share scheme.  The Revenue has now decided that this interpretation goes 'beyond the strict terms of the law'.

<h4>Retirement benefit plan solvency standards proposed</h4>

<p>Following proposals for minimum solvency requirements for retirement benefit plans in the UK, there is much debate about how rigorous the requirements should be. The Government is currently seeking comments on proposals that will mean:

<ul>
<li>a company retirement benefit plan can promise final salary benefits, but
<li>in the event of termination, may provide benefits that fall short of the promise.
</ul>

<p>While there are many reasons for adopting this approach, the proposals will be viewed as unacceptable by those whose first concern is that the plan can deliver what is promised — under all circumstances.

<p>However, when the new legislation is drawn up it will only set minimum standards, and individual plans may choose to operate above the minimum.  The legislation will not remove responsibility from employers and trustees and they should review solvency according to their particular needs and concerns

<H2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>CEO pay rose 7% in 1993</h4>

<p>Median total annual compensation (salary plus bonus) for chief executive officers (CEOs) of large US companies rose about 7% last year to US$1,282,800, according to early results of Towers Perrin's latest annual study of executive compensation. These preliminary findings ---- drawn from the most current proxy statements of 107 Fortune 1000 companies ---- show that CEOs saw bigger gains in the long-term portion of their pay packages. Median total direct compensation, which factors in the expected value of 1993 long-term plan grants (including stock options), was just over US$2.4 million.

<p>Thus, the study suggests that the largest single segment of the total CEO pay package ---- the long-term incentive portion ---- now makes up about half of the total mix. These findings confirm that executive compensation in the US is becoming more closely tied to the executive's ability to contribute tangibly to the creation of shareholder value.

<p>Overall, the CEOs studied saw some what modest increases in their cash compensation last year. Median base salary, at US$711,500, increased 6%, which is in line with 1993 salary increases for employees at other levels.  In addition, CEOs of just over 25% of the 107 companies studied thus far either took a salary cut or received no increase in base salary last year,  while more than a fifth (21%) saw a decrease in their total annual compensation. At the same time, however, 1993 was apparently a good year to exercise stock options, with 44% of the group choosing to do so ---- for a median gain of US$593,400.

<h4><a name="us2">Companies adjust FAS 87 rates</a></h4>

<p>Another recent Towers Perrin study shows that most companies have taken 1993 capital market trends to heart in choosing key economic assumptions for use in valuing pension benefit obligations in their 1993 year-end financial disclosures. With long-term bond yields approaching 30-year lows last year, all but two of the 40 Fortune 500 	companies studied reduced the discount rates they use in accounting for pensions under Financial Accounting Statement (FAS) 87 ---- most by a full percentage point or more. The discount rate is an assumed interest used in calculating the present value of future benefit payments.

<p>For the group as a whole, the average FAS 87 discount rate declined to 7.26% at the end of 1993 from 8.08% a year earlier. Discount rate reductions of this magnitude (more than 80 basis points on average) can trigger significant increases in the size of the pension obligation. For example, a 1% reduction can cause a company's pension obligation to grow by as much as 15%.

<p>Downward adjustments in the FAS 87 salary-scale assumption can soften the impact on earnings for companies with salary-based pension plans. Almost three-quarters of the companies in the survey that have salary-based plans reduced these assumptions as well, although not by enough to fully off set the earnings impact of the discount rate reductions.
