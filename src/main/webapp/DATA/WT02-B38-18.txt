Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization

   Hoping to resuscitate its real estate lending business, Bank of Boston
Corp. is radically altering its operations: From now on, it will only
originate commercial mortgages that can be securitized.
   In an exclusive arrangement, the nation's 16th-largest bank has engaged
Goldman, Sachs & Co. to structure and distribute mortgage-backed notes that
can be sold to several classes of investors.
   Bank of Boston's move is a departure from the traditional real estate
operations of banks, which have always been long-term holders of commercial
mortgages. It's performance is sure to be tracked by regional banks
nationwide, many of which are weighing similar plans.
   The strategic shift results from months of discussions between senior
officials at Bank of Boston and outside securitization experts, including
advisers from Kenneth Leventhal & Co. and the New York law firm of Weil,
Gotshal & Manges.
   In talks earlier this month with borrowers and other outsiders, Bank of
Boston management expressed a sense of urgency about shifting its approach
from "book and hold" to "originate and sell." According to a bank position
paper, failure to adopt a securitization strategy would jeopardize its
commercial mortgage franchise. Under such a scenario, the bank said it
would:
   * "Lose a large portion of our asset base in one to three years."
   * "Have no competitive term credit to attract new relationships."
   * "[See its] revenues decline due to the loss of higher spread credit."
   * "Not be in control of our balance sheet as we continue to acquire
banks."
   Like many other institutions, Bank of Boston has been a reluctant real
estate lender during the early part of this decade - in contrast to its
aggressive style in the 1980s. For the most part, it has been booking mini-
perms (three- to five-year loans) that carry strict covenants and recourse
provisions. With such onerous terms, the bank has been losing prospective
borrowers to its competitors, and the outlook has worsened with the
proliferation of Wall Street's commercial mortgage conduits.
   Now that real estate values are rebounding, the bank wants to offer
friendlier terms on loans that can be regularly packaged into commercial
MBS and rolled off its balance sheet.
   In July, Bank of Boston's 90 commercial mortgage originators will start
hawking the new product line. It features long-term (five- to 20-year)
loans without covenants or recourse provisions. The bank will write
$750,000 to $10 million loans. The credits will carry fixed and adjustable
rates, amortizing over 20 or 25 years.
   The goal: To re-establish Bank of Boston as a one-stop resource for
developers and other real estate owners in need of construction, mini-perm
or long-term financing. The new program is designed to finance shopping
centers (anchored and unanchored), apartment buildings,
industrial/warehouse facilities, office buildings and hotels.
   By securitizing these loans, Bank of Boston can continue to build real
estate relationships and generate fee income, while meeting management
concerns about its asset-liability mix, risk exposure and capital
requirements.
   How does the bank plan to profit from its securitization program? The
bulk of its earnings will come from the "positive arbitrage" that is left
over from a loan's interest rate after paying issuance expenses and the
required yield to MBS holders.
   The bank estimates it will charge borrowers 275 to 350 basis points over
the Treasury curve and be left with 50 to 70 bp of profit. That projection
is considered somewhat optimistic, given that lenders are being forced to
lower their loan prices in order to cope with mounting competition.
   On top of the loan spread, the bank will also collect an origination fee
equal to 1.5% to 2.25% of the total loan amount, plus a $16,500 application
charge.
   MBS investors can expect Goldman, Sachs to provide a fairly regular flow
of multi-class issues, each backed by at least 30 mortgages. A typical
issue will be made up of a triple-A rated senior tranche yielding 100 to
125 bp over Treasuries, a smaller single- or double-A tranche yielding 140
to 175 bp over, a double- or triple-B class yielding 300 to 600 bp over and
an unrated piece with spreads in the mid- to high-teens.
   Spokesman for Bank of Boston and Goldman, Sachs did not return calls for
comment.
   Bank of Boston is counting on the securitization program to
substantially boost its origination capacity from its current annual
commercial mortgage output of about $250 million. It's not known whether
the bank also plans to securitize part of its $3.5 billion in existing real
estate loans, which were not underwritten with MBS investors in mind.
Nearly half of its current portfolio is secured by New England properties,
with the rest scattered throughout the U.S.

S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume

   Standard & Poor's Corp. was the most active rating agency in the
commercial MBS market in 1993, working on more than half of the year's
dollar volume, according to data compiled by Commercial Mortgage Alert.
   Of the $14.7 billion in transactions for which rating information was
gathered, S&P rated offerings valued at $7.6 billion.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc. and Duff & Phelps Corp. were neck-and-neck
for second place. Fitch rated issues valued at $6.75 billion, while D&P's
total was $6.70 billion. Moody's Investors Service Inc. came in last, with
$6.2 billion of rated deals.
   S&P also ranked first based on the number of deals rated, with 46,
followed by D&P (42), Fitch (36) and Moody's (28).
   The survey - the first ever to track rating-agency activity in the CMBS
market - also showed that Fitch's business grew by a whopping 63% last
year, from $4.1 billion in 1992. The number of deals it rated more than
tripled.
   Moody's was the only agency to see its volume fall, logging a 12%
decline, from $7.1 billion.
   Still, several executives at Wall Street firms expressed surprise that
the agency ended up so close to the pack. Moody's suffered several key
staff defections last year, which limited its ability to process
transactions. The firm estimates that it turned away a couple of billion
dollars of offerings that it otherwise would have rated.
   What's more, Moody's has taken a strict view on certain types of
commercial MBS. That strategy has rankled underwriters, opened up
opportunities for rival agencies and, ultimately, cost Moody's some market
share. But because of its stellar reputation among bondholders, Moody's
ended up rating most of the year's biggest deals.
   Investment bankers weigh a number of factors when selecting a rating
agency, but the requirements of investors tend to be the dominant factor.
MBS buyers often insist that transactions be rated by either S&P or Moody's
- the two most-established agencies. And for most deals, they want the
comfort of two ratings. This opens the door for the market upstarts, D&P
and Fitch.
   Another key factor is service: How quickly and smoothly a deal will be
rated, as well as the accessibility of analysts to investors. At the end of
last year, when deal volume picked up sharply, the agencies were swamped
with business. Moody's temporarily stopped accepting additional business in
September. S&P, which has a much bigger staff dedicated to commercial MBS,
was forced to do the same the following month.
   Things have calmed down somewhat since the beginning of the year, with
deals usually taking six to eight weeks to go through the rating process.
One Wall Street executive commented that all of the agencies still have
bottlenecks, but he - and several others - singled out Fitch for providing
particularly good service.
   Because the issuer's cost of funds is generally the overriding concern
in every deal, underwriters are known to shop for agencies that will
require the least subordination in order to attain the desired rating. An
increase in the level of subordination, or other credit enhancement
features, can lead to dramatically higher borrowing costs.
   The individual bias of each agency is also well known in the market.
Moody's, for example, is comfortable with multi-family and retail deals,
but is wary of offerings backed by debt on office buildings and hotels.
Fitch has led the way on deals collateralized by nonperforming assets, but
is especially strict on offerings with single borrowers.
   D&P has been regarded as the most lenient and least influential of the
agencies. But underwriters said that D&P has become tougher under the
direction of Joseph C. Franzetti, a respected analyst who was recruited
last September from S&P, where he ran the mortgage-backed securities group.
    At the other end of the scale is Moody's, which seems to pride itself
on being the toughest rater. Last fall, for example, it issued a widely
publicized warning to investors about a "marked deterioration in the credit
quality" of commercial mortgage issues.
   "We're much less concerned with market share than with assigning high-
quality ratings," said Tad Philipp, associate director of the agency's
structured finance group. "We're never going to have the market share of
some of the other rating agencies."
   Despite their frustrations with the agency, investment bankers would
love to see Moody's play a bigger role in the CMBS arena, because of its
powerful reputation in other segments of the bond market.
   For this reason, some are perplexed by the fact that Moody's has devoted
fewer resources to this market than its rivals. After losing some staffers
to Wall Street houses last year, Moody's at times found itself with as few
as four or five professionals in its commercial MBS area, down from its
full complement of seven. The agency is on the verge of filling two new
positions, but it is still out-manned by its rivals: S&P employs about 20
professionals, while D&P has 14 and Fitch has 13.
   Philipp said that Moody's is committed to the market and expects it to
grow. "But we don't feel the need to staff up to handle peak volumes."

How the Rankings Were Compiled

   Commercial Mortgage Alert used its new CMBS Database to calculate the
volume of business handled by each of the four rating agencies over the
last two years.
   The Database, which includes every transaction completed since the
market's inception, carries rating information for the vast majority of
deals in recent years. All told, there were 123 deals valued at $17.7
billion that closed in 1993. But of those, issues with a face amount of at
least $1.7 billion were not rated - $638.4 million in Fannie Mae deals and
$1.1 billion in private placements used to finance acquisitions by Goldman,
Sachs & Co.'s Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund.
   Of the remaining $16 billion in deals, rating information from at least
one agency was gathered for offerings totaling $14.7 billion.
   Because of confidentiality agreements, the rating agencies declined to
provide information about private placements, and in some cases this
information could not be learned independently. The agencies did provide
aggregate data. S&P, for example, said it rated 62 commercial MBS deals
last year totalling $8.2 billion. And Moody's said it rated a total of $7.2
billion in deals. However, the survey counted only ratings that could be
tied to specific transactions.
   Agencies were given full credit for the total principal amount of an MBS
issue, even if they rated only some classes in a deal.

What They Charge

   Commercial MBS underwriters say fees don't play much of a role in their
selection of a rating agency.
   The four agencies each charge about the same - and their compensation
pales in comparison to other issuance costs, such as legal fees. The rating
agencies are usually paid six to 10 basis points of the value of the rated
classes, or $60,000 to $100,000 for a $100 million transaction.
   However, the complexity of a deal is also factored in, as well as the
geographic diversity of the collateral. Those factors can push the fee to
20 basis points or more.
   Underwriters say that Fitch tends to charge more than its rivals, but
not materially so.

Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling

   If Freddie Mac heeds the advice of Lehman Brothers Inc., it will soon be
canceling its plans to securitize a $1 billion portfolio of performing
multi-family mortgages.
   Last week, Lehman, as financial adviser to Freddie, recommended against
the transaction - saying the issue did not make economic sense for the
agency. The purpose of the offering was to free up capital that Freddie
could recycle back into the mortgage market.
   Bear Stearns Cos., which would underwriting the offering, continues to
lobby hard in favor of the transaction.
   Considerable dissension has developed among senior executives at the
mortgage agency about whether to go forward with the offering. The
principals involved will air their differences at a pivotal meeting that is
scheduled for this Wednesday.
   Michael May, a Freddie vice president for structured transactions,
predicted a final decision would be made within two weeks.
   As envisioned, the transaction would have involved  Freddie selling
subordinate tranches and retaining the senior notes.

Multi-Family Paper Blows Out

   Strong investor demand enabled Natwest Markets to rapidly sell $50
million in fixed-rate securities backed by debt on apartment complexes
owned by Southwest Property Trust Inc., a Dallas REIT.
   The two-class offering, priced June 3, was oversubscribed, forcing
Natwest to scale back individual allotments in order to give all investors
a piece of the pie.
   The senior $50 million class, rated double-A, was priced at par to yield
7.824%, or 110 basis points over the seven-year Treasury. The offering also
included an interest-only strip, which was sold to an unnamed investor.
   The spread on the senior notes was 20 basis points tighter than the
spread on Southwest Property's similar $50 million transaction last
December - a time when many more deals were competing for investors'
attention. But for the REIT, which initiated the transactions to finance
the acquisition of multi-family properties, tighter spreads were small
consolation for the higher yield it must pay: 7.82% versus 6.54% in
December.
   Both transactions grew out of a $100 million line of credit that Natwest
Markets provided to Southwest Property last year.
   The REIT tapped half of the credit line in November to finance the
acquisition of six properties. The REIT paid back the bridge loan with the
proceeds of the first securitization, which was backed by new mortgages on
13 apartment complexes in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona.
   Southwest Property drew down the rest of the credit line over the past
few months to finance other acquisitions. That bridge financing was paid
off with proceeds of the latest securitization, which was backed by new
mortgages on 12 garden-style properties in Texas, one in New Mexico and one
in Arizona.
   The offering carried attractive prepayment protections for bondholders.
If the REIT prepays the mortgages, it will have to pay bondholders the
difference between the coupon on the securities and the prevailing Treasury
rate. The yield-maintenance agreement is designed to protect investors
against declining interest rates by compensating them for having to re-
invest their funds at lower yields. Under these provisions, bondholders
usually receive the difference between the coupon and a rate equal to the
Treasury yield plus an additional spread. In the Southwest Property deal,
however, investors will receive the difference between their coupon and the
flat Treasury rate, making the potential compensation greater than normal.
   The class A notes mature in February 2001, but are extendable for two
years. If the notes are extended, their coupon rate, currently 7.72%, will
be increased to either 9.43% or 375 basis points over the seven-year
Treasury, whichever is higher at the time.
   The two Southwest Property transactions were the first commercial MBS
deals handled by Natwest Markets, the New York investment banking arm of
London-based National Westminster Bank PLC.

DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels

   The conduit operated by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and Equitable
Real Estate Investment Management Inc. is expanding into the hotel sector.
   The team, which already originates and securitizes multi-family and
retail credits, plans to extend up to $1 billion of hotel loans nationwide.
   Equitable believes that the time is right to get back into the
rebounding hotel sector, which it pulled out of five years ago. This time
around the company will employ more conservative underwriting standards.
For instance, it will base lending decisions on the properties' historic,
rather than projected, income.
   Under the program, Equitable will identify borrowers through its
national network of investment offices. The loans will be originated by
Column Financial Inc., an Atlanta-based joint venture between the conduit
partners. DLJ will then securitize the mortgages. Equitable Real Estate and
DLJ are subsidiaries of Equitable Companies Inc.
   The conduit will originate non-recourse loans with 10- to 20-year terms
for all types of lodging properties. Loans will range from $2 million to
about $25 million, with interest rates that are 325 to 450 basis points
over Treasuries, depending on the debt-service coverage. A 1.75 DSC ratio
would merit a 325 bp spread. But a 1.40 ratio - considered more likely for
hotel properties - would result in a 350 to 400 bp spread.

Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros

   Greystone & Co., an investment banking boutique, has started a
commercial MBS unit, staffing it with three veterans from the disbanded
mortgage operation of Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   The unit will originate and buy commercial and multi-family mortgages,
and may also form an alliance with another mortgage originator. Greystone
has applied to become a broker/dealer so it can underwrite securitizations.
   The former Daiwa officials, who were hired in the past few weeks, are
David Goodwin, Mark Jarrell and Thomas Lally. Goodwin will review the
underwriting of mortgages, while Jarrell will structure deals and get them
rated. Lally will trade commercial MBS. The three executives had similar
jobs at Daiwa, which shut down its 35-member mortgage unit at the end of
March.
   Greystone also hired two other former Daiwa pros, who will concentrate
on residential mortgage securities. Wayne King will trade complex single-
family derivatives, such as interest-only strips, while Michael Gough will
trade both residential and commercial MBS.
   Until now, Greystone has focused mostly on advising on the restructuring
of tax-exempt issues that have defaulted. It has also invested in FHA-
insured multi-family mortgages and Ginnie Mae MBS backed by multi-family
properties.
   In February, the seven-year-old company, which is solely owned by
Stephen Rosenberg, moved its headquarters to New York from Atlanta to take
better advantage of the capital markets. The hirings boosted Greystone's
staffing to 15.

Nomura Places Warehouse Paper

   Surprising its skeptics, Nomura Securities International Inc. last week
fetched the price it wanted for $122.5 million in securities backed by
mini-warehouses.
   When Nomura started shopping the double-A notes for Shurgard Storage
Centers Inc., a Seattle REIT, it discussed pricing them at a spread of 120
basis points over seven-year Treasuries. Some investors said the
transaction, backed by a collateral type still relatively new to
securitization, would never get done at spreads of less than 130 bp.
   But in the end, Nomura was able to slightly better its initial target,
pricing the single-class offering at 102% of par value for a 115 bp spread.
The offering was helped by its strong bondholder protections and the
scarcity of new issues in the market. Still, it took Nomura several weeks
to privately place the notes.
   The deal will allow Shurgard to refinance debt on 86 properties.

THE GRAPEVINE

   Andrew Stone's two former lieutenants at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
are working on freelance deals. Gregory Jacobs and Paul Nidenberg are
advising mobile-home park owners, who are former Daiwa clients, on how to
raise $100 million through a collateralized offering. The duo hooked up the
borrowers with Merrill Lynch & Co., which could float the issue next month.
Three other ex-customers of Daiwa are also talking to the securitization
specialists about a similar mobile-home park financing. Jacobs and
Nidenberg left Daiwa in March, when the mortgage unit was shut down.
                               *   *   *
   Ocwen Financial Corp. and Eichler Fayne & Associates have parted ways on
their multi-family conduit arrangement. Unspecified differences of opinion
led to the split, although sources described the parting as amicable.
Eichler originated some $400 million in mortgages in the past year for the
conduit. The San Francisco firm will continue to originate loans for Fannie
Mae as one of the agency's delegated underwriters/servicers. It may also
team up in a conduit with another funding source. For its part, Ocwen,
which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., will now rely entirely on its
thrift subsidiary, Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, to originate
mortgages on apartment complexes.
                               *   *   *
   CS First Boston Group is on track to securitize about $1 billion of
FDIC's performing commercial mortgages within six weeks. The deal will be
the agency's first - and probably only - attempt at securitizing commercial
loans. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. are co-managing the
offering. To maximize returns from the issue, the agency will provide a
partial guarantee on the issue's underlying collateral. The offering is
expected to involve $800 million to $1.25 billion of securities.
                               *   *   *
   Goldman, Sachs & Co. is arranging to swap $265 million in multi-family
mortgages for Fannie Mae securities. The deal is likely to be similar to
the transaction the Wall Street firm handled last December for the owner of
the Lincoln Towers co-op complex on Manhattan's West Side. In that deal,
GMAC Mortgage Corp. of Elkins, Pa., originated mortgages on eight buildings
in the complex. The mortgages were funded by Goldman and exchanged for
Fannie MBS. Goldman then packaged the securities in a $112.5 million
offering. The transaction fell under Fannie Mae's old swap program, in
which subordination was not required to protect the agency against defaults
on the underlying mortgages.
                               *   *   *
   Meanwhile, Fannie Mae is about two weeks away from finalizing its
guidelines for swap transactions by conduits. Look for the agency to be
tougher than expected on requirements for debt-service coverage. Agency
officials have decided to charge higher guarantee fees and demand more
subordination than originally planned for deals that are judged to have
border-line debt-service coverage.
                               *   *   *
   Smith Barney Inc.'s pending $130 million nursing-home deal will be
backed by debt on 44 properties owned by Integrated Health Services of Hunt
Valley, Md. The fixed-rate securities, rated by S&P and D&P, are expected
to come to market in four classes. The offering was originally planned for
this month, but Smith Barney pushed it back to July. Integrated's deal is
one of several that the investment bank has been working on for some time.
