<H2>Transportation Coordination Group (TCG)</H2>

<HR>
OCRWM established the Transportation Coordination Group in 1986 to facilitate information exchange with its stakeholders on transportation activities and planning, and to support the discussion and resolution of specific technical and institutional issues.  Meetings of the Transportation Coordination Group were suspended due to fiscal year 1996 funding reductions of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project. </P>
