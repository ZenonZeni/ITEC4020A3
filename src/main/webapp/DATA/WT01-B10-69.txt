<H1 ALIGN=center>ENDOMETRIOSIS 
</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=left>Mark Perloe, M.D. </H2>

<H3 ALIGN=left>WHAT IS IT?  </H3>
<a href="galendo.html">Endometriosis</a> is described as the presence of endometrial tissue in locations outside the endometrial (uterine) cavity. Endometriosis is commonly found in the cul-de-sac (behind the uterus), the rectovaginal septum (the tissue between the rectum and vagina), on the surface of the rectum, the fallopian tubes and ovaries, the uterosacral ligaments, the bladder, and the pelvic side wall. Generally endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum is more likely to deeply the underlying structures.<p>

<H3 ALIGN=left>IS ENDOMETRIOSIS A GENETIC DISEASE?</H3>  
Studies have shown that sisters have a six times increased risk compared to their husband's sisters.  Other studies show up to an eight times increased risk when compared to other women. Affected sisters are more likely to have severe disease than other. Although these studies suggest a genetic basis, presently, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The OXEGENE Study is enrolling family members with endometriosis to try and identify the genetic basis of this disease. <p>

<H3 ALIGN=left>WHAT ARE THE CAUSES? </H3> 
Commonly during the menstrual period, cells can be found in the fluid behind the uterus. The most widely held theory, retrograde menstruation, states that endometriosis occurs when endometrial fragments attach to nearby pelvic structures and grow.  Other theories include tissue transplantation, induction of changes in peritoneal lining cells, spread through uterine veins, and direct extension through the lymphatic system.  No one theory seems to explain all cases.<p>

As endometrial cells are frequently seen in peritoneal fluid in all women at the time of menses, one would expect endometriosis to develop in everyone. Obviously this is not appear the case.  Unfortunately, we don't really know why. Is the immune system the cause? Immunological changes have been demonstrated in women with endometriosis, however, it is uncertain whether these immunologic findings are responsible for the endometriosis or are a result of the inflammation caused by endometriosis.  <p>

<H3 ALIGN=left>HOW COMMON IS IT?</H3>  
At the time of tubal ligation 2-5% of women will have endometriosis, while between 25-50% of infertile women have been reported to have endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 5 million U.S. women, approximately 6-7% of all females, 30-40% of whom are infertile.  <p>

<H3 ALIGN=left>STAGING SYSTEM</H3> 
The American Social of Reproductive Medicine has established a grading system to document the degree of severity of the disease.  Unfortunately, this is not been particularly helpful in predicting response to therapy.  <p>

<H3 ALIGN=left>SYMPTOMS</H3> 
The most common symptoms associated with endometriosis are pain and infertility, however, premenstrual spotting, urinary urgency, rectal bleeding, painful urination, bloody cough, and skin nodules may also be noted.  Endometriosis may frequently mimic other disorders such as pelvic adhesions, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, and ulcer disease. Careful evaluation is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis.  Diarrhea or rectal bleeding and tenesmus (sense of rectal fullness) at the time of menses are particularly telling symptoms.<p> 

<H3 ALIGN=left>ENDOMETRIOSIS IS A PROGRESSIVE DISORDER</H3>  
Dr. Redwine described the progressive nature of endometriosis lesions. They are first seen as clear vesicles, then become red, and then progress to black lesions over a period of 7-10 years.  Dr. Karnaky described water blister lesions becoming blue dome cysts over a period of 4-10 years.  The clear lesions are seen are at an average age of 21.5 while black scarred lesions are seen at a mean age of 31.9.  This progression from clear to red to black lesions with age confirms the progressive nature of this disease if left untreated.  Disease will progress in 47-64% of women without therapy and approximately 20% of women with therapy.<p>  

There is poor correlation between the degree of pain or infertility and the severity of disease.  Early lesions which are clear or red are metabolically more active than older, dark, fibrotic lesions. This metabolic activity may be responsible for the associated infertility, immune abnormalities, urinary urgency, pelvic pain or diarrhea.<p>

<H3 ALIGN=left>DOES ENDOMETRIOSIS AFFECT FERTILITY?</H3>  
In cases where there is obvious disruption of the normal anatomy, endometriosis is a known cause of infertility.  In fact 30-40% of patients with endometriosis are infertile.  This is two to three times the rate of infertility in the general population.<p> 

In patients with endometriosis, the monthly fecundity (chance of getting pregnant) decreases by 12-36%.  However, the long term cumulative pregnancy rates are normal in patients with minimal endometriosis and normal anatomy.  Studies provide contradicting information, but the bulk of research at this time indicates that pregnancy rates are not improved by treating minimal endometriosis. <p> 

Let's evaluate the specific factors that may contribute to infertility in patients with endometriosis. <p> 
<B>Hormonal parameters:</B>  Compared to a normal cycle, the follicular phase may be shorter in patients with endometriosis, the estradiol may be lower, and a blunted LH surge may be seen.  Progesterone levels and luteal phase endometrial biopsies, however, are normal.  There is a tendency towards greater number of follicles which are smaller at the time of the LH surge in patients with endometriosis.  However, this data does not prove that endometriosis is the cause of infertility.  Women with subtle ovulatory dysfunction are more likely to have infertility and it may be that infertility or an abnormal hormone profile increases the likelihood of endometriosis.<p>  

<H3 ALIGN=left>LUTEINIZED UNRUPTURED FOLLICLE</H3> 
In women with severe pelvic adhesions where the ovary is encased, luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) may be noted.  This is believed to occur when, despite normal hormonal parameters (LH surge), the egg is not released from the ovary.  Endometriosis is found in 63% of those patients reported to have LUF.  LUF is seen in 35% of patients with endometriosis versus 11% of patients without endometriosis.  However, the detection of follicular rupture by ultrasound and laparoscopy is very subjective and the diagnosis of this condition is complicated. Therefore, studies that look at endometriosis and LUF must be held suspect. <p> 

<B>IVF and Experimental models:</B> Studies in rabbits have shown that surgical induction of endometriosis leads to a decrease in fertility from 75% to 25%.  This may be due to anovulation associated with endometrial implants.  Studies have evaluated immune modification in the rabbit model to attempt to restore fertility. <p>

We know that during in vitro fertilization endometriosis patients have normal hormonal profiles. There is a tendency towards fewer oocytes and it appears that oocytes derived from ovaries with endometriomas may have a lower fertilization rate and implantation rate. <p> 

In order to understand whether this effect is due to the embryo or the uterine environment we can look at donor embryo studies. Dr. Simon found decreased donor oocyte implantation rates when the oocytes were from women with endometriosis.  In his study, endometriosis in the recipient had no effect on implantation while other studies have found conflicting results.<p>  

On the other hand, Dr. Lessey performed endometrial biopsy surface at the time of implantation and found lower levels of vitronectin (an adhesion molecule on the endometrial surface) in women with unexplained and endometriosis related infertility.  Treatment with Lupron and ovulation induction appeared to restore this implantation marker and fertility. <p> 

<B>Peritoneal Effects:</B> The effect of endometriosis on the peritoneal environment may adversely affect fertility.  There is an increased volume of peritoneal fluid, and peritoneal macrophages (scavenger white blood cells), are increased both in number and activity.  Cytokines (white blood cell chemical messengers) such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Interferon, C3, C4 are all increased.  These  may adversely affect sperm oocyte interaction, sperm mobility and survival, and oocye pick up.  In addition, serum samples obtained from women with endometriosis were found to be embryotoxic in mouse embryo cultures 78% of the time versus 20% in women without endometriosis.<p> 
<B>Immune System:</B> The immune system is affected by endometriosis and may adversely affect fertility.  Patients with endometriosis may show decreased nature killer cell function, and decreased reactivity to transplanted endometrial tissue.  In addition, complement, an immune component that breaks apart abnormal cells, is elevated in patients with endometriosis. <p> 

<H3 ALIGN=left>TREATMENT OF ENDOMETRIOSIS RELATED INFERTILITY</H3> 
Danazol, birth control pills, Lupron, Synarel, Zoladex, depot-Provera and Norplant have not been proven effective as either primary or adjunctive therapy (combined with surgery) for endometriosis related infertility. While the use of medical treatment may decrease inflammatory reactions making surgical correction easier and reduce endometriosis-related pain, use of these medications in patients with minimal disease is of no proven benefit in treating infertility. <p> 

Multiple studies have reported a 4-5 times improvement in fecundity (monthly chance of conception) with empirical treatment, super-ovulation with either clomiphene or injectable gonadotropins (Humegon, Metrodin, Pergonal) combined with intrauterine insemination.<p>  

While complete excision of all disease and restoration of normal anatomy should be the goal of any surgical treatment, aggressive surgery may result post-operative adhesion formation. The endoscopic surgeon may need to strike a balance between excising all visible disease and limiting the risk of adhesion formation. If surgical excision is incomplete or attempts at pregnancy are to be delayed, it is advisable to plan continuous hormonal suppression following surgery.<p>  

In women with distorted tubal-ovarian anatomy due to endometriosis, the first surgery is the most effective. Repeat surgical interventions are less effective at restoring fertility, than the initial attempt, which is best performed by a skilled endoscopist. <p>

Although most studies have found no proven benefit of  surgical treatment for minimal endometriosis, more recent studies by Dr. Olive, Dr. Nowroozi, and Dr. Sulewski have shown increased pregnancy rates with treatment of this disease.  Therefore, as endometriosis is generally considered a progressive disorder, aggressive management at the time of its discovery is appropriate. <p> 

Surgical treatment of endometriosis consists of cautery, coagulation, excision or vaporization.  As most cul-de-sac endometriosis is generally deeper than it may at first appear, excision should be the treatment of choice. Vaporization of adhesions on the ovarian surface, bladder flap, and uterine peritoneum may be beneficial. <p> 

Treatment of ovarian endometriomas has included removal of the ovary, simple drainage, destruction of the cyst-lining with laser, bipolar electrosurgery, monopolar electrosurgery, and excision of the ovarian cyst. Although in many cases the cyst-lining can be stripped from inside the ovary during laparoscopy, in approximately 30% of the cases, this cannot be performed.  In these cases, unless destruction of the lining is carried out, the endometrioma will likely recur.  Use of an Argon beam coagulator, C02 laser or bipolar electrocautery are the methods of choice in this situation.  Monopolar cautery must be used with caution as deeper penetration with this method may destroy normal ovarian tissue and cause premature ovarian failure. <p> 

Pregnancy rates following surgery generally range between 35-40% for severe endometriosis to 55-65% with milder disease.  There appears to be no difference in pregnancy rates with laparoscopy or laparotomy with laser or electrosurgical techniques.  While long term pregnancy rates may approach 65%, surgical studies that look at fecundity show monthly pregnancy rates as low as 3-6% per month following surgical treatment of this disease. Usually normal fecundity can be achieved with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination. Dr. Martin found that post-operative pregnancy rates appeared best for those with infertility of short duration of one to two years of 68%. Those who had been trying between three and seven years had a 43% pregnancy rate, while those with eight or more years of infertility showed a pregnancy rate of less than 10%. <p> 

In patients with normal anatomy, a reasonable trial of injectable gonadotropins and intrauterine insemination is three to four cycles.  If normal anatomy cannot be restored or the patient has not been successful with ovulation and intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization should be considered. In women with large endometriomas, removal of the ovarian cyst may be necessary prior to proceeding with in vitro fertilization.  Many physicians are now recommending immune screening prior to proceeding with in vitro fertilization for patients with endometriosis. While initial data look promising, further studies will ascertain the appropriateness of this approach.<p> 

<H3 ALIGN=left>DEVELOPING A PLAN</H3>
When determining appropriate course of treatment for this disease, it is necessary to challenge fertility concerns with correction of pain and other symptoms.  Surgical treatment is best performed by skilled endoscopists who can balance your desired fertility with the need to aggressively excise abnormal endometrial tissue, restore normal anatomy, and treat pain and other symptoms.  As endometriosis is a progressive, ongoing, long term disorder, patients should plan to establish an ongoing relationship with a physician who is a skilled endoscopic surgeon, is comfortable with all medical aspects of treatment, is experienced in managing infertility and most important, one who is available and willing to listen when you have a concern. <p>
