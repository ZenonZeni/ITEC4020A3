<CENTER><H3><B>SUBSTITUTE BILL WOULD INCLUDE MAJORITY OF COALITION'S RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B><P>

Following is a letter which CEC delivered to Senate and House Committee Members to inform
them of the issues in reauthorization which with we still have major concern, and which
constitute our "bottom-line issues."<P>

<b>CEC Letter To Senate and House Committee Members<br>
July 11, 1996</b><P>

This letter, from the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC),  is on behalf of 52,000 educators,
researchers, parents, and others who advocate on behalf of children with disabilities and gifted
children.  As we approach the long-awaited conference on the reauthorization of IDEA, CEC is
compelled to remind you once again about the remaining issues about which we have major
concerns.  We ask your assistance in working with us as we support your efforts in the
completion of this reauthorization.  <P>
  
As you well know, CEC has worked in good faith with you throughout the last several years on
this very difficult reauthorization process.   We appreciate all the effort that you and your staff
have invested in this important legislation.  It certainly has not been easy, and while we have
sometimes disagreed, we have all been united in our belief in the value and importance of IDEA
to America's children and families.  <P>

CEC is well aware that this process has been one of compromise on everyones' part, including
ours.  Be assured that, at this point, we remain committed to the process.  In fact, CEC is pleased
about a number of IDEA changes included in the current Senate and House bills.  We must say,
however, that commitment to the process is becoming increasingly difficult as we proceed and
issues of paramount importance to our membership remain unresolved.  These major issues
include:<P>

<ul><li><b>Discretionary Programs</b>.   The discretionary programs included under Parts C-G of the act are the foundation and support of efforts to ensure the availability of services for all
children with disabilities.  These efforts include research, demonstration, training, technical
assistance and other support activities which assist in ensuring that the goals of IDEA are met. 
Widespread support exists for maintaining current law in this area. This is clearly CEC's
preference.  However, working with existing bills, the Senate language provides a thoughtful
organizational structure that could be strengthened if language is added to ensure support for all
existing authorities across all age ranges of children. <P> 

<li><b>FAPE</b>.   The most important principle of the IDEA is the guarantee of a free
appropriate public education to ALL children with disabilities.  Over the last 20 years, the
courts, up through the Supreme Court, have supported the concept of "all children" without
exception.  CEC is strongly opposed to any exception to this guarantee and therefore opposes
provisions in both bills that allow the cessation of services for some children.  While CEC is
firmly committed to strong disciplinary provisions to keep our schools safe, our members do not
believe it is ever good public policy to deny children an education.<P>

<li><b>Qualified Personnel</b>.   Special education, related services and early intervention
always should be provided by qualified personnel.  To accomplish this, CEC believes in the
state's responsibility to set and ensure professionally recognized standards for individuals
providing such services.  These standards may include paraprofessionals, or other career ladders
within specific disciplines, as long as staff in these positions have the necessary training, perform
tasks for which they are qualified, and have the appropriate level of supervision.  CEC does not
support the use of waivers to address personnel shortages.  In addition, CEC is committed to
retaining current IDEA language that allows only those institutions that have professionally
recognized standards to receive discretionary funds under IDEA.<P>

<li><b>Paperwork Burden</b>.   CEC is deeply disturbed that both bills, if implemented as now
drafted, will require greater paperwork for all participants in the educational process.  Many, if
not most, of these changes to IDEA are clearly "good practice" particularly those that further the
parent-professional partnership.  However, current law allows these practices which represent
effective implementation strategies that many school districts have already adopted.  The balance
required here is to encourage good practice and address difficulties in implementation with the
overwhelming desire not to increase paperwork and administrative burden.  To encourage the
practices addressed in these changes, CEC recommends that appropriate language be included in
the conference report and that targeted technical assistance be made available to states and local
school districts.<P>

<li><B>Disruptive Behavior</b>.   CEC is strongly opposed to any proposals to amend IDEA
that would allow unilateral placement changes for children with disabilities as a consequence of
"disruptive behavior".  Provisions as contained in both the House and the Senate bills go
significantly beyond any reasonable considerations of safety. Behavior is an instructional issue
which can be appropriately resolved through the IEP process by the parents, student and school
personnel within the provisions of the current statute.  No change is necessary.     Further, terms
such as "disruptive behavior"as specified in the Senate bill or as descibed  in the House bill are
vague and subject to multiple individual interpretations.  This would lead to significant increase
in litigation that would be necessary to define this subjective term. <P>

Further, CEC is most concerned that changes under consideration in the Senate could result in
students being placed in an alternative education placement based upon a subjective
determination of "disruptive behavior".  In many cases, we fear this would be an inappropriate
home placement.  We must insist that protections of the child's right to the availability of FAPE
in the least restrictive environment be maintained.   Placement options must include the full
continuum and decisions about placement must be based upon the student's needs in accordance
with the IEP.<P>

Maintaining behavior conducive to learning is necessary to meet the goal of an effective
instructional program for all children.  The question becomes, given the undefinable nature of
"disruptive behavior", how could this new provision be applied to children with disabilities
without establishing a double standard, raising civil rights concerns.  While disruptive behavior
is a problem for schools across the country, there is no evidence that this problem can be
attributed disproportionately to children with disabilities.</ul><P>

In conclusion, CEC asks for your continued support as a member of the authorizing committee to
work with us in ensuring that the final IDEA bill protects and enhances this important legislation.
Be assured, we are continuing to offer assistance to staff to help resolve these major problems
with the current bills and to address other smaller but important issues still unresolved.  Please
contact us at your convenience for any information or assistance we can provide.  CEC's
members are committed to protecting IDEA and appreciate your support for programs for
children with disabilities and their families.  <P>


Sincerely,<P>


Nancy Safer<br>
CEC Executive Director<p>
