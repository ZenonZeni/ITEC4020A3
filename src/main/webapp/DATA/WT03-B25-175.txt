This new measuring system from Brown &amp; Sharpe is based on the premise <BR>
that machinists are making money when they are making parts. <BR>

<P>&quot;We are a group of engineers,&quot; says Michele P. Vidmar, product manager, Measuring Systems, Brown &amp; Sharpe Manufacturing Co. (North Kingstown, RI). &quot;When we come at a project, we tend to do so as engineers.&quot; Which means, of course, that the outcome of that project is likely to have a highly technical solution base. Whether one is needed or not. &quot;For this project, we&quot;--she means a team consisting of representatives of R&amp;D, software, mechanical engineering, electronics, and even marketing--&quot;came at it as machinists.&quot; Starting about four years ago, these people started visiting shops, both large and small. &quot;We wanted to learn about measurement--the opposition to it, and what's needed.&quot;

<P>In other words, they discovered that some measuring machines seem to be made more to the liking of engineers 
than machinists.

<P>So Vidmar and her colleagues started with the proverbial blank sheet and created what is now being launched as 
the RefleX, which Brown &amp; Sharpe is describing as an &quot;intelligent coordinate measuring system.&quot; It can be used as a measuring machine, a height gage, and even operated as a dial indicator (to emulate a surface plate tool). It can take point-to-point measurements. It can be used to scan for reverse engineering. And all of this can be done in a remarkably straight-forward manner.

<P>The yellow and black manual coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is based on the aluminum-construction MicroVal CMM that Brown &amp; Sharpe launched in the late 1980s. If you ever had any doubts about the importance of controls 
to modern manufacturing methodologies, then the RefleX can put them to rest. What Vidmar and the team determined 
is that what really makes or breaks a machine in terms of its usability on the shop floor is the user interface. While there will probably be more elements coming out of the RefleX research, including different types of probes and even a whole new machine, the key thing about the product available now is the electronic control unit. Given that this is a manual machine, it is not a controller in the conventional sense of something that moves the elements. But there is a 32-bit RISC processor. A VGA screen. And software that not only has the measuring and processing capabilities needed to meet comparatively demanding measuring requirements, but is simple enough so that its use is straight-forward. Something that someone 
is actually likely to use.
