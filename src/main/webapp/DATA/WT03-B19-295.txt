<P>
Research into cellular growth factors, from basic biological discovery through to production, clinical trials and full commercialisation, is the main goal of the CRC for Cellular Growth Factors.
The CRC was established in July 1991 as a joint venture between four leading medical research organisations and a commercial partner. Its major research effort is directed towards the discovery of novel growth factors active on white blood cells and nerve cells. The centre aims to use such information to design new drugs with improved biological specificity or efficiency.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Research programs are structured into seven different projects involving scientists from each of the venturers. These projects focus on different aspects of the way cell growth is regulated by the action of growth factors and how this knowledge can be used to devise strategies for treating human disease.
To ensure that flexibility is built into the research activities, the centre has established a group of central laboratories to provide expertise in antibody production, molecular biology, protein chemistry and protein expression.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The CRC has developed two research re-agents currently on sale worldwide. The potential clinical and commercial use of the agent leukaemia inhibitory factor is currently being evaluated. New screening methods have also been developed to identify and purify novel growth factors based on the receptors they utilise.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Blood growth factors (some of which were originally discovered by scientists now in the CRC) are among the top selling biopharmaceuticals in the world, generating sales in excess of $2 billion per year. The CRC aims to generate new biopharmaceuticals of this type and to improve on the existing ones.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria remains at the forefront of medical research in Australia with a high concentration of the most prestigious medical research institutes and research hospitals. In particular, the field of blood growth factors originated in Melbourne medical research institutes.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Postgraduate students enrolled at the University of Melbourne may undertake their research studies at the centre. Students are required to obtain support through competitive scholarships. The educational programs of the centre are designed to supplement and expand those already existing in the partner institutes and include various seminar programs and lecture series.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The centre has only one commercial partner (AMRAD), who acts on its behalf in commercialising projects or in negotiations with other companies. As sole commercial partner it can actively participate in all research programs at all levels without being hindered by commercial confidentiality issues.
AMRAD supports individual projects it identifies as commercially valuable by providing research funding and picking up all patent and commercialisation costs. To date 11 patent applications arising from CRC research have been filed. The development of possible pharmaceuticals from these discoveries is a long term objective.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
In addition to the funding of $14.4 million provided by the Australian Government over seven years, the centre receives funding from AMRAD Corporation for individual research projects. Each of the remaining partners make in-kind contributions to a total value of $4.8 million per annum.
