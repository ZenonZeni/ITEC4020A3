Improvements in Engine Combustion<BR>
</H2>


Argonne has been working with Compact Membrane Systems to develop a low-cost, permeable membrane that would separate ambient air into oxygen-rich and nitrogen-rich streams for use in engines. The membrane (about the size of an air filter) would provide an oxygen stream for the engine to improve combustion, while thenitrogen stream would be fed  into the exhaust as a plasma to reduce NOX emissions.<BR>
<P>

<H3>
For Diesel Engines:
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Need to meet particulate and smoke emissions standards
<LI>Solution : Increasing the in-cylinder concentration of oxygen from the ambient 21% to 25% results in a reduction of almost 60% in particulate emissions at rated load conditions, while engine power output is increased by 50% with only a nominal (15%) increase in peak cylinder pressure.
</UL>

<H3>
For Alternative Fuels:
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Air toxic emissions for alcohol fuels and low power density for natural gas engines
<LI>Solution : With 25% oxygen concentration in the cold phase, experiments show that M85 vehicles can meet CO, NMOG, NOX, and formaldehyde emission standards for TLEV and Tier II. Research also indicates that oxygen enrichment will increase the power density of vehicles powered by natural gas.
</UL>

<H3>
For Gasoline Engines:
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : High hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions during engine cold-start
<LI>Solution : Tests show that the proposed California TLEV and Tier II emission standards can be met by using 25% oxygen during the cold phase of the Federal Test Procedure.
</UL>

<H2>
Advanced Sensors for Combustion Control
</H2>

Argonne has developed an innovative electrocatalytic gas microsensor that is sturdy and inexpensive, operates at several hundred degrees Celsius, and identifies a wide variety of gases and vapors at concentrations approaching 1 ppm. The microsensor's versatility comes from an innovative use of cyclic voltammetry, neural-network signal processing, and ceramic-metallic, or cermet, materials. In principle, the microsensor can measure the concentration of any gas species that reacts with oxygen in its sensing element. The sensor system could provide real-time emission sensing and feedback for advanced combustion control.

Control of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions
</H2>

<H3>
Using Catalysts to Control Nitrogen Oxide Emissions from Lean-Burn Engines
</H3>

In the presence of the excess oxygen found in the exhaust gas from lean-burn engines, the current generation of catalysts is unable to control NOX emissions. In partnership with the Low Emissions Partnership of the United States Council on Automotive Research, a consortium of the three major automobile manufacturers, Argonne is one of five national laboratories conducting cooperative research on catalysts for NOX control in the exhaust gas from lean-burn gasoline engines. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOX to nitrogen, in the presence of excess oxygen, by unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas appears to be an ideal emission control scheme. The ZSM-5 zeolite charged with copper ions accomplishes this conversion with good efficiency, but it is very susceptible to long-term deactivation under engine exhaust conditions. Argonne is working to understand the factors that promote the effectiveness of this catalyst and to ascertain how they might be replicated in a more durable catalyst material. 

<H3>
Using Monatomic Nitrogen to Reduce Nitrogen Oxide in Engine Exhaust
</H3>

Historically, engine designers have had to live with the trade-offs between control of particulates and NOX in diesel engines and between NOX and fuel economy in all engines. This situation is becoming more difficult as the NOX emissions standard becomes even more stringent. Argonne’s success in using monatomic nitrogen plasma to reduce NOX emissions from gasoline-fueled automotive engines (50-90% reductions of NOX have been achieved) led Caterpillar, Inc., to fund an evaluation of the concept for heavy-duty diesel engines. It is expected that data from the laboratory evaluation will guide Caterpillar’s decision to move this technology to the commercialization phase. A one-of-a-kind facility, the monatomic-nitrogen-generating test bench, is being used in the evaluation.

Automotive Two-Stroke Engines
</H2>
Argonne is pursuing advanced engine concepts research with Mercury Marine Division of Brunswick  Corporation (Fond du Lac, Wisconsin), a major manufacturer of two-stroke engines. The current CRADA with Mercury Marine is to conduct applied research in materials for automotive two-stroke engines. The components that have been shown to have problems in automotive applications are pistons, rings, bearings, and exhaust ports. The main engine-component stress comes from thermal loads 
caused by high temperatures encountered in the two-stroke combustion cycle. The ceramic materials development program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has identified a few advanced low-wear, heat-resistant materials that could be used in the form of coatings, composites, or monolithic components to handle high thermal stress.

Advanced Materials and Lubricants
</H2>

<IMG SRC="../jpegs/student.jpeg" ALIGN=LEFT>

Advanced engines, such as gas turbines and those fueled by diesel, will operate at elevated temperatures and pressures. These harsh conditions require improved lubricants and coatings for engine durability and reliability.

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Wear and corrosion of fuel injectors using alternative fuels, or injectors under high pressure
<LI>Solution : Argonne is working with diesel engines and gas turbines to develop processes for depositing diamond-like coatings on metallic and ceramic components.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Wear in gears, bearings, drives, and other automotive parts
<LI>Solution : A self-replenishing lubricant, boric acid, reduces friction and wear and is environmentally safe.

"Clean Diesel" Bus Technologies
</H2>
The use of alternative fuels in city buses could help transit operators meet mandated air quality regulations. However, a large
capital investment would be needed to convert the fueling infrastructure and buses. If oxygen-enrichment technology could be applied to meet air quality standards, or if a diesel-electric hybrid system were implemented, the use of these "clean diesel" buses could delay that investment for many years. The Regional Transit Authority in northern Illinois initiated a project with Argonne to evaluate the possibility of applying these technologies to Chicago Transit Authority buses. Following a limited number of engine tests and computer analyses, Argonne concluded that both concepts are practical and could result in a "clean diesel" bus that meets the mandated limits of the Clean Air Act Amendments. <Br>
<P>
Argonne staff used dedicated models to analyze the performance and emissions of a typical urban bus powered by conventional diesel fuel and an optimized diesel-electric hybrid system. The results compared favorably with published bus data.
