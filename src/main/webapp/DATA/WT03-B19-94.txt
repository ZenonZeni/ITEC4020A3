<h2>
Being Thankful</h2>
<p>

<i>By Cyndi Jones, Publisher</i>
<p>
This last week MAINSTREAM was honored by the Los Angeles County
Committee on Disabilities. It was a wonderful event at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. But the occasion caused me to think about 
people who work day in and out for the movement and never get
thanked.  It caused me to pause and think about what I had to be
thankful for.  
<p>
Bill.
<p>
For my parents and family.
<p>
For a quality education. Not every child with a disability 
received this.
<p>
For Edie and her commitment to the cause. (And the Alan Glou gang
in Needham who created a positive working environment for her.)
<p>
Susie and Carol, who have worked with me for over five  years.
<p>
For Mike Jablonski, our computer doctor, mentor and friend.
<p>
Good health.
<p>
Two crazy cats.
<p>
A van that keeps on running.
<p>
Great weather.
<p>
Readers who respond with wonderful notes of appreciation.  And
readers who say that they love the magazine - but can't afford  to
subscribe. They keep me focused on the real issues of disability.
<p>
A new generation of great kids with disabilities.
<p>
A home that shelters body and soul.
<p>
Love and laughter.
<p>
Wonderful colleagues and collaborative efforts that delight  us.
<p>
For Johnson Press of America, our printer of 14 years,  and their
staff who help us - Glenn, Linda, Betty, Judy, Nancy  and Gene.
<p>

For our writers, photographers and artists - Art Brackley,  Robin
Olimb, Mike Brown, Kathi Wolfe, Doug Lathrop and Bill Bolt.
For Ben Runkle, the Voice of MAINSTREAM (on tape).
<p>
For Jerry Marino, consultant extraordinaire.
<p>
For our advertisers, they are the best!
<p>
For our super travel agent, Mary Muller, who finds the  BEST deals
and puts up with all our crazy travel plans.
<p>
Competition that helps us to do better and be better.
<p>
Ideas that turn into action.
<p>
For all the help on GO VOTE - Shawn Casey O'Brien,  Jenifer
Simpson, Chris Button, Justin and Yoshiko Dart, Becky Ogle,  Fred
Fay, Jim Dickson and Dave Williams.
<p>
I'm thankful for individuals who keep up the struggle  and those
who keep pushing the agenda forward.
<p>
For those who have been bold enough to file an ADA complaint  or
initiate a lawsuit, putting America on notice that this law will 
be enforced.
<p>
I'm thankful for companies that have voluntarily complied  with the
ADA. It gives me hope that justice will prevail.
<p>
I'm thankful for the leaders, who began working for  our rights
when no one believed people with disabilities had any rights.
<p>
I'm thankful for this community - its perseverance  and commitment
to justice.
<p>

Happy Thanksgiving!
