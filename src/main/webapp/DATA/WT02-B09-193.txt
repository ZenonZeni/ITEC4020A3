<h2>EDITORIAL -- Marijuana as Medicine </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>WHAT A SENSE of justice and relief many AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma and multiple sclerosis patients felt last year when both houses
of the state Legislature passed a bill allowing them to use marijuana to
ease their pain and nausea. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Some otherwise law-abiding citizens already had been using
the illegal weed to combat the ravages of their diseases. Others were aware
of the helpful effects of pot and wanted to try it but could not bring
themselves to defy laws against marijuana use and possession. When both
the state Senate and Assembly approved the medicinal marijuana measure
by Senator Milton Marks, D-S.F., both groups expressed gratitude. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>But their victory was short-lived. Despite its legislative
approval after substantive hearings, Governor Wilson vetoed the bill. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Let us hope that in this non-election year, compassion
and good sense rule and that an identical measure, by Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos, D-San Jose, passes and, this time, is signed by Wilson. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The Assembly did the right thing last week by approving
the measure. Now it is up to the Senate and the governor to provide the
opportunity for relief from suffering for many patients for whom marijuana
controls nausea caused by anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs, lowers eye pressure
caused by glaucoma and reduces muscle spasms and pain related to multiple
sclerosis. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The measure is narrowly drawn and would not change laws
against marijuana possession and use for the general public. It simply
would allow suffering patients -- with doctor approval -- to possess or
cultivate marijuana for personal use. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Several medical studies have shown marijuana does ease
pain and nausea for many patients. Recognizing this, a number of communities
have chosen to look the other way when known cancer -- and other -- patients
grow pot. But neither the patients nor law enforcement should be forced
to disobey the law to provide medical relief. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The patients' hopes were raised, then dashed, last year.
A repeat of that cruel outcome is not acceptable. </font></p>
