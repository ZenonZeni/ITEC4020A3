<P><A NAME="train"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Gerson Therapy Physician
Training Program</FONT></P>

<P>For many physicians, managing the care of patients with chronic
debilitating illness can be a time-consuming and unfulfilling task.
Conventional protocols in treatment of degenerative diesases can
often offer limited benefit to the patient and can severely
compromise the quality of life during and after the treatment
period.</P> 

<P>The Gerson <FONT SIZE=-2>(tm)</FONT> Therapy provides
an answer to the physician who seeks a holistic, scientifically
proven treatment for life-threatening illness. Originally developed
in the 1930s by <A HREF="maxbio.html">Max Gerson, M.D.</A>, the
therapy offers the health care professional a safe, viable and
practical method of treating many degenerative diseases.</P> 

<P><A HREF="treatmnt.html">The Gerson Therapy</A> is an integrated
holistic protocol developed by Max Gerson, M.D. for standalone and
adjunctive use in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Over <A
HREF="biblio.html">200 articles</A> in the peer reviewed medical
literature document its effectiveness, and provide further
understanding of the tissue damage syndrome (intracellular edema),
supplementing nutritional deficiencies through the use of fresh,
organic fruit and vegetable juices. Providing an intensive, nutrition
based, high-fluid, micronutrient, salt and water management, the
Gerson Therapy is rich in phytochemicals, supplements potassium, and
restricts dietary fat, protien, and sodium. Extensive mechanical
detoxification through enemas combined with stimulation of
glutathione production systems dramatically improve elimination of
cell wastes.</P> 

<P>Because of the non-specific nature of the protocol, it is often
effective in treatment of a wide range of cancers, autoimmune,
collagen, and degenerative diesases. The Gerson Therapy has been
shown in the medical literature to be extraordinarily effective in
achieving long-term remission in Stage I-IV melanomas, exceeding
survival rates achieved with conventional managements by as much as
40%. [This study is available for viewing <A
HREF="melanoma.html">here</A>.] Dramatic long-term recoveries have
been observed with lymphoma, Duke's-C colorectal cancer, ovarian
cancer, and oat cell and adenocarcinomas of the lung. Biopsy-verified
full remissions have been observed in astrocytoma and cancers of the
breast, liver, pancreas and prostate, including some cases with
extensive metastases. Full remission of symptoms has been documented
in a number of cases of systematic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. </P> 

<P>Relatively unique about the Gerson management is that it does not
use any proprietary medications. All medications and supplements are
classed as biologicals, and are supplied in therapeutic amounts. All
are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. All of the
procedures, medications, and techniques used in the protocol have
been fully tested and effectively used for many years, and are
completely safe when used according to the protocol.</P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why The Gerson Therapy is a Sensible Choice for your
Practice</FONT></P>

<P>There are many paths to wellness, and many different philosophies
about appropriate treatment of life-threatening degenerative
diseases. <I>Why choose the Gerson Therapy over the many other
treatments available?</I></P> 

<P>We believe the answer lies in the combination of results, patient
satisfaction, scientific approach, and our philosophy of coordination
and partnership with practitioners and treatment centers.</P> 

<P>We believe the Gerson protocol itself to be the most complete,
all-encompassing approach to wellness available anyhwere. The Gerson
Therapy incorporates dietary and lifestyle modification,
sophisticated biochemical managements, intensive, multi-faceted
detoxification, psychological and mind/body approaches, and attention
to symptomatic relief through non-toxic means. When appropriate, the
Gerson protocol is combined with other proven managements to provide
the most complete, powerful approach to cancer and other degenerative
diseases available anywhere. We constantly review the medical
literature, seeking new ways of reaching even the most advanced cases
of cancer and disease. The Gerson Institute approaches modifications
and additions carefully, with great consideration, and sound testing
before inclusion in the Gerson protocol, ensuring both the
practitioner and patient of the safest, most efficacious treatment
available.</P>

<P>Adding the Gerson protocol to your practice will give you the
satisfaction of seeing rapid improvement in health and outlook in
otherwise &quot;terminal&quot; patients. Since patients are actively
involved in restoring and maintaining their own health, they tend to
develop self-reliance, decreasing &quot;emergency&quot; and panic
calls, and increasing satisfaction with their medical treatment. As a
certified Gerson practitioner, you will participate in case review
with the Gerson Institute, providing us with valuable statistical
data, and ensuring that you have appropriate expertise available for
the treatment of difficult or unusual cases.</P>

<P>Financially, working with Gerson patients is rewarding, as
patients will require consultations and follow-up care on a regular
basis for twenty-four months or longer. Also, since they become very
dedicated to their treatment, patients often discuss their treatment
with friends, co-workers, family, and others, resulting in
word-of-mouth referrals, the most effective form of advertising.</P>

<P>As a certified Gerson practitioner participating in our referral
program, you will benefit from our national advertising, outreach, and
education efforts. Patients seeking outpatient treatment in your area
will be referred to your practice. The Gerson Institute will also
coordinate with you and endeavor to schedule educational seminars and
lectures with Gerson Institute staff in your area, further helping to
build your clientele of Gerson Therapy patients.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Training Patients in the Gerson
Protocol</FONT></B></P>

<P>The responsibilities of the physician managing a patient on the
Gerson Therapy will vary with the condition of the patient and
diagnosis, but typically includes the regular monitoring of patient
status and disease staging through interpretation of pathology and
other appropriate means.</P> 

<P>Modifications in diet, medications, and other protocols must be
prescribed based on both traditional and non-traditional indications.
The physician must also be prepared to assist the patient in managing
acute healing reactions with dietary and/or medication modifications,
and emotional support. We have found that the psychological aspect of
treatment is important, particularly during this reaction period.
Access to the treating physician is vital, as many of the healing
responses are unfamiliar, and can therefore be frightening to the
patient and his or her family members or care providers.</P>

<P>In addition to the medical interventions required, it should be
understood that the Gerson protocol is a complex combination of
dietary restrictions, medication and enema administration, and
lifestyle and environmental changes. We recommend that practitioners
provide patients with complete instruction and followup in the
specifics of the treatment, either through the distribution of Gerson
Institute publications and videos, or through individualized patient
training and ongoing consultation.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gerson Therapy Certification: A Partnership for
Success</FONT></B></P>

<P>The new era of managed care, limited resources, and tight cost
controls in medical treatment have opened the door for broad
acceptance of treatment such as the Gerson protocol. Gerson care
costs are significantly lower than conventional cancer managements,
benefiting insurance providers. Practitioners benefit by establishing
a health partnership with their patients, improving the
doctor/patient relationship, and reducing the likelihood of
dissatisfaction that can lead to costly legal actions.  Patients
benefit by developing self-confidence, improving their outlook, and
taking responsibility for their well-being.</P>

<P>Public demand for the scientifically proven Gerson Therapy
treatment is skyrocketing. In 1995, in response to the increasing
demand for Gerson Therapy treatment, the Gerson Institute began to
develop medical education and certification programs to increase
access to the Gerson Therapy, and to protect the reputation for
excellence and high quality care that the Gerson name has come to
represent.</P>

<P>Practitioners seeking to use the Gerson Therapy in
their practices achieve certification through a four-phase process.
Completion of the Level I training described below is the first phase.
The second phase is completion of a two-week internship at a Gerson
inpatient treatment center. Intern practitioners will work directly
with patients and experienced Gerson physicians. In phase three,
practitioners will treat patients in their own practice,
with assistance and supervision from Gerson Institute staff and
Gerson-trained physicians. The last phase is a three-day training,
review, and skill-assessment program. To maintain certification,
practitioners must maintain a high standard of patient care and
appropriate treatment, follow Gerson Institute guidelines regarding
patient management and treatment, provide data tothe Gerson Institute
for research, case management, and statistical purposes, and complete
approved continuing education units. We anticipate that
practitioners who work diligently will be able to complete the
certification process in twelve to eighteen months. A complete,
detailed description of the certification program will be available in
early 1997.</P>

<P>The certified practitioner will be eligible for a
number of benefits, including the following:</P><UL><LI>Ongoing
consultation and support from Gerson Institute staff and
Gerson-trained physicians</LI> <LI>Access to a network of other Gerson
practitioners</LI><LI>Gerson Institute patient referrals seeking
treatment and long-term follow-up</LI> <LI>Permission to use the
Gerson name in connection with treatment of patients and marketing for
new patients</LI> <LI>Support with local publicity and outreach to
develop your practice</LI> </UL> 

<P><B>We invite you to work with us. Through the efforts of our
organization and a group of talented, dedicated medical
practitioners, we can achieve our vision of making this safe,
effective treatment available to patients worldwide.</B></P><P> <HR

<P><A NAME="phase1"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Treating Degenerative Diseases
with the Gerson Therapy: Phase I Training Program</FONT></P> <P>This
program is designed to introduce the health care practitioner to the
practice of the Gerson protocol as originally described in Gerson's
Monograph, &quot;<I><A HREF="booklist.html#acancertherapy">A Cancer
Therapy</A></I>&quot; (Historic Edition, Gerson Institute, 1996), with
current enhancements and additions. The six day intensive training
will offer direct instruction from Charlotte Gerson, experienced
Gerson-trained physicians, and other senior Gerson Institute
staff.</P> <P>Practitioners attending the program will gain a
fundamental understanding of the Gerson Therapy treatment,
assessment, follow-up and monitoring protocols, and will have access
to resources for ongoing training, support, and consultation from the
Gerson Institute.</P><P>The nature of interactions between various
elements of the Gerson protocol require serious study and
considerable clinical experience before full understanding of the
protocol will be gained.  For this reason, the training program is
intended as a starting point for practitioners seeking to incorporate
Gerson protocols into their practice.</P><P><B>Presentations Included
