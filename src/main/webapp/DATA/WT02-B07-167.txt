ETHANOL-- AMERICA'S FUEL FOR THE 21st CENTURY</B>
<P>
By Leland Swenson, President, National Farmers Union</CENTER>
<P>
Skyrocketing prices for propane and other oil-based heating fuels have gotten the attention of the American public.  As a nation we spend millions, if not billions, of federal tax dollars each year assuring access to imported oil for a handful of multi-national corporations.  Nonetheless, as the 105th Congress reconvenes, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the powerful House Ways & Means Committee, is  calling for the elimination of the federal excise tax exemption and the blenders tax incentive on reformulated fuels, such as ethanol blended fuels.  In addition, many state legislatures are talking about the elimination or reduction of state excise tax exemptions on reformulated fuels.
<P>
National Farmers Union supports expansion of current national energy programs that have improved air quality in U.S. cities, provided economic opportunities and reduced U.S. dependence on foreign oil.  American consumers also recognize the social, environmental and economic value of renewable fuels and are committed to encouraging the development and use of renewable fuels with tax dollars.  
<P>
In a poll conducted following the November 1996 elections by the Republican polling firm, Research/Strategy/Management, Inc., 82 percent of Americans said they prefer directing current federal tax policies to encourage the use of domestically produced renewable fuels. 
<P>
In fact, 71 percent said they support continuing the federal 5.4 cent-per-gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol-blended fuels.  The overwhelming support of U.S. renewable fuels policy varied little among Republicans, Democrats and Independents.    
<P>
<B>Ethanol has played a major part in reducing pollution in the nation's major cities.</B><BR>
The 1996 fiscal year annual report of the Environmental Protection Agency recognized the Reformulated Gasoline Program as a major element in improving the nation's air quality.  The EPA report showed significant reductions in concentrations of toxic air pollutants.  Benzene was reduced approximately 38 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Carbon monoxide fell by 15 percent, and volatile organic compounds were reduced by 15 percent. With results like these, it is clear why three in four Americans say they are willing to continue tax incentives to ethanol blenders. 
<P>
<B>Ethanol production creates American jobs.</B><BR>
The ethanol industry is currently responsible for over 40,000 direct and indirect American jobs, contributing more than $5.6 billion annually to the U.S. economy.  Ethanol production utilizes more than 5 percent of the nation's corn crop.  The corn demand for ethanol production increased corn producers' incomes by more than $1.2 billion--or about 11 percent--in 1994.

<P>
<B>Ethanol industry development reduces our dependence on foreign oil. </B> <br>
Simmons & Co., a Houston-based oil consulting firm, predicts that world oil demand will grow by 11 billion barrels per day over the next five years, while currently producing fields reduce production by 8 billion barrels per day.  
<P>
Meeting this additional 19 billion barrel-per-day demand won't come cheaply.  Already, refiners in the U.S., Europe and Japan that a decade ago produced at 75 percent of maximum capacity,  are being worked at nearly 95 percent capacity.  Wouldn't it be wise for the U.S. to secure its energy needs before a worldwide shortage occurs?  We as citizens need to let our elected representatives know of our commitment to renewable sources for America's energy needs in the 21st century.

<CENTER><B>MEMBERS OF CONGRESS EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO ELIMINATING ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</B></CENTER>
<P>
Rep. Bill Archer's (R-TX) stated intention to eliminate the ethanol tax incentive in the 105th Congress has evoked a strong negative reaction on Capitol Hill.  Last week, Rep. Lane Evans (D-IL) circulated a letter signed by 12 key Members of Congress representing 8 different states expressing opposition to Archer's "intention to propose cuts to the federal tax incentive for ethanol."  
<P>
The letter, which was also sent to members of the Transportation Tax Task Force established by Archer, states, "Ethanol has proven to be an important economic investment in domestic renewable energy. It has reduced our nation's dependence on imported energy, created thousands of jobs throughout rural America, reduced air pollution, and increased energy security."
<P>
"At a time when rural America is in need of our help, we believe that cutting the tax incentive would be untimely and detrimental to the U.S. economy. The ethanol tax incentive enjoys strong, bi-partisan support in Congress and is considered essential by American agricultural and financial leaders."

<CENTER><B>REP. ENGLISH INTRODUCES BILL TO ELIMINATE ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</B></CENTER>
<P>
As he did during the last Congress, Representative Phil English (R-PA) has again introduced legislation to eliminate the federal ethanol program.  The legislation, H.R. 161, would eliminate all the applicable tax incentives for ethanol-blends, E-85, and ETBE in 1998, two years earlier than currently slated to expire. To date, Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) are co-sponsors of H.R. 161.
<P>
Rep. English has characterized his legislation as eliminating the tax incentive for large ethanol producers only.  In fact, the bill eliminates the tax incentives for all gasoline marketers, regardless of size.  While Rep. English has left in place a small producer tax credit (an income tax credit of 10 cents per gallon), the fact is this tax credit cannot be widely used by any ethanol producer.  
<P>
In order to take advantage of the income tax credit, a producer must have significant income to offset liabilities.  In the highly competitive ethanol production industry, no producer can generate enough tax liability to take advantage of the credit. Moreover, because many of the small producers are owned by farmer cooperatives, they cannot pass the benefit along to their members.  Rep. David Minge (D-MN) sponsored legislation in the 104th Congress to correct the anomalies in the small producer tax credit that prevent it from being utilized by ethanol producers.

<HR>
<I>Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, has stated his intention to eliminate the ethanol tax incentive in the 105th Congress.  The following article is the first in a series that will address some of the questions he has raised in his effort to undermine political support for the federal ethanol program:</I>
<P>
<B>Who do the tax incentives for ethanol benefit and disadvantage economically?</B>
<P>
The direct beneficiaries of the tax incentives for ethanol use are the oil companies that blend and market ethanol fuels.  In fact, only oil companies are allowed to claim the excise and income tax benefits provided by law.  Specifically, I.R.C. §4081 provides gasoline refiners and marketers selling ethanol-blended gasolines a 5.4¢ per gallon excise tax benefit (assuming a 10% blend is used, a lesser excise tax exemption is available for lower level blends of ethanol) from the 18.1¢ excise tax on gasoline.  As an alternative, I.R.C. §40 allows oil companies using ethanol to claim a 54¢ per gallon income tax credit.  
<P>
The existence of the tax incentive allows refiners and marketers to purchase ethanol for octane or oxygen content at competitive prices.  The tax incentive has been a pro-competitive influence on the nation's transportation fuel markets.  This point is reinforced by the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America in a recent letter to the Senate Finance Committee:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"the federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have been an important, pro-competitive influence on the nation's gasoline markets.  By enhancing the ability of independent marketers to price-compete with their integrated oil company competitors, this program has increased independent marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of gasoline."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The indirect beneficiaries of the federal ethanol program are numerous, and include consumers, farmers and, of course, ethanol producers.  
<P>
As noted above, the ethanol incentive benefits  <B>consumers</B> by helping reduce the consumer price of gasoline by providing independent gasoline marketers with octane and oxygenate choices that enable them to price-compete with their major oil company competitors.  As a result, the nation's largest consumer organization in the country, Citizen Action, strongly supports the increased use of ethanol.  According to Ed Rothschild, Energy Director for Citizen Action, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The use of ethanol, a domestically-produced, cleaner-burning renewable fuel helps American consumers use less polluting oil and reduces dependence on costly oil imports, which are in part subsidized by huge foreign tax credits."     						
</BLOCKQUOTE>
By creating important additional value-added markets for grain, the ethanol tax incentive also helps farmers.  According to one recent report, the ethanol industry supports 55,000 jobs, creates $7 billion in economic activity including $2.2 billion in increased farm income annually, and generates more than $555 million in net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury each year.  It is for this reason that farm organizations across the country enthusiastically support the federal ethanol program.  
<P>
<CENTER><img src="011697a.gif"></CENTER>	
<P>
As noted in one recent letter to the Congress from national agricultural groups:
<P>
"Perhaps more than anyone, farmers recognize the need for and are committed to balancing the budget and eliminating unnecessary federal spending.  The 1996 Farm Bill clearly reflects that commitment.  But the federal ethanol program is not an example of unnecessary spending.  The tax incentives for ethanol production have helped build this important value-added industry, just as federal incentives have helped support the domestic oil and gas industry.  The ethanol program is sound public policy that deserves to be maintained."
<P>	
Finally, because the ethanol tax incentive allows <B>ethanol producers</B> to successfully market their product, they also benefit from the tax incentive.  The federal ethanol program has built a domestic ethanol industry that today has a capacity of more than 1.5 billion gallons at 52 plants across the country, utilizes more than 600 million bushels of grain, and supports more than <B>55,000 jobs</B>.

<CENTER><B>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCREASES E-85 PURCHASES</B></CENTER>
<P>
The General Services Administration (GSA) has agreed to increase its total purchases of E-85 Ford Tauruses to 1,029, up from 702, according to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition.  
<P>
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), a percentage of the federal government's new vehicle purchases must be alternative fueled vehicles (AFV).  The percentages are 33% in 1997, 50% in 1998, and 75% thereafter.  President Clinton signed an Executive Order in December recommitting the federal government to these purchase requirements.
<P>
In order to meet the 1997 requirement, the federal government would need to purchase 11,000 AFVs.  "The 1,029 E-85 vehicles still fall short of the mark.  This is disappointing since state governments are meeting or exceeding the new standards established by the federal government," said LaMoine Smith, Nebraska Corn Board.

<CENTER><B>CHRYSLER UNVEILS ETHANOL-BASED 
FUEL CELL VEHICLE</B></CENTER>
<P>
Chrysler Corporation introduced a fuel-cell vehicle that is capable of reforming ethanol into hydrogen on board the vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 11-20.   The technology to reform ethanol was developed in cooperation with Arthur D. Little, the Illinois Corn Marketing Board, and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.
<P>
The fuel-cell vehicles use reformer technology to store fuel-such as ethanol-as a liquid, converting it to hydrogen on an as-needed basis.  It is not feasible to store hydrogen on-board a vehicle as the gas takes up 3,000 times more space than liquid fuel.
<P>
"Fuel cells are twice as efficient as conventional internal combustion engines, cutting fuel costs to consumers in half and decreasing the U.S. reliance on imported energy sources," said Bill Mitchell, Program Manager for the Arthur D. Little hydrogen technology unit.  
<P>
"The fuel cell story is generating excitement nationwide, but people are missing an important part of the story.  This technology was designed to run on ethanol, which means it will run best on a domestically produced fuel," said Illinois Corn Marketing Board Research Committee Chairman John Phipps.
