<H3>Sociocultural Factors in Public Acceptance: Comparative risk studies involving France, the USA and
 the UK. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/poumbio.html">Marc Poumadere</A> and Claire Mays.</H3>



<P>
Nuclear energy production is a technology which concentrates public fears and concerns, and therefore
 the industry has originated several innovative approaches to risk analysis and management, and also to
 risk perception and communication.

<P>
Risk perception by members of the public relies upon intuitive judgements, which are influenced by the life
 experience and values of the person, and by media representations of hazards. More than 24 criteria affect
 the intuitive estimation of risk, and these are grouped into broad classes. Different social groupings give
 typically different risk ratings, eg., civilians give a higher risk rating than experts to civilian nuclear energy.
 People generally perceive there to be more risk  now than in the past, and believe that future risks will be
 even greater. Risk communication to the public should be pragmatic, consisting of real problem solving in
 context, not ready-made approaches.

<P>
A discussion follows of a comparative study of perceptions of risk associated with nuclear energy in France,
 a country noted for its apparently passive acceptance of the dominance of nuclear, and in the US. Topics
 such as knowledge and acceptance of nuclear development, perception of health risks, confidence in nuclear
 organisation, energy options, and world-views, were explored through telephone questionnaires in each country.
 Results are tabulated and discussed. The most striking contrast between the two countries was that although
 more of the French gave a high risk score to the top ranked public health risk, nuclear waste, than did the
 Americans, more of the French were happy to leave nuclear energy operation and its health risks to the
 experts. This is explained by the two countries' differing systems of democracy.

<P>
A similar study of attitudes to nuclear waste repositories at Sellafield and in France revealed the French
 to be more preoccupied with perceived risks. There appears to be a connection in both countries between
 waste management and social conflict, while at Sellafield, the data suggested that people had negative
 feelings about the repository but were unlikely to take action about them; they felt also that they possessed
 insufficient information and that their views would be disregarded. An information programme response to
 this situation is suggested, which would reassure residents, allow them to air their views in acceptable ways,
 and give them a tangible role in decision-making. 

<P>
Interviews with waste management communicators in this study pointed up the difficult transition between a
 traditional, authoritarian model of nuclear management and a new, socially responsive one. The UK's new 
model takes its authority from science, the French one from the people, through Parliament. These models
 are not universally applicable however. Research into risk perception must be continuous, and relationships 
built between public acceptance specialists, managers of risky technologies, and decision makers in government 
and industry.
