<p><strong>HAVANA</strong> - After five years of belt-tightening and self-
sacrifice to save their revolution, the Cuban people 
finally see signs of a dawn.</p>

<p>The economy is once again growing after the collapse of the 
Soviet Union destroyed 85 percent of Cuba's export market, a 
blow that struck the island with the force of ten 
hurricanes. Washington saw it as their chance, finally, to 
finish off Cuban socialism.</p>

<p>They enacted the Torricelli bill and the Helms-Burton bill 
to tighten the 34-year economic blockade, an act of war that 
still inflicts pain and suffering on the Cuban people. Jorge 
Mas Canosa and his Miami mafia were already packing their 
bags for a triumphant return to Havana.</p>

<p>Their plans haven't panned out.</p>

<p>Juan Triana Cordovi, director of the Center for the Study of 
the Cuban Economy, told me Cuba's 450,000 sugar cane workers 
are expected to harvest five million tons of sugar this year 
- double the tonnage during the depths of the "special 
period." The nickel miners have already produced 50,000 tons 
of refined nickel and cobalt in a joint venture with 
Sherritt International, the Canadian corporation that 
refuses to bow to Sen. Jesse Helms. Joint ventures in 
tourism and other industries are bringing in development 
capital.</p>

<p>It is all the result of the determined hard work by millions 
of Cuban workers and campesinos. They possess the 
indomitable spirit of the "Old Man and the Sea." Everywhere 
I visited during a one-week tour of Havana and nearby 
cities, this month, I saw signs of the material shortages 
inflicted by the blockade. And everywhere I witnessed the 
quiet determination not to "say uncle" to Washington's 
pressure tactics. Two slogans can be seen on walls and 
buildings everywhere: "Si se puede!" (Yes we can do it!) and 
"Patria o Muerte" (Fatherland or death).</p>

<p>Crowds wait with the patience of Job at bus stops. Every 
imaginable conveyance has been pressed into service, even ox 
carts. Hundreds of 1950s era Chevies trundle along, most of 
them running on hand-made spare parts. Soviet motorcycles 
with sidecars carry as many as five passengers.</p>

<p>The Cubans have invented the "camel" a semi trailer with two 
humps pulled by a truck. Passengers are packed in like 
sardines. Thousands ride Chinese-manufactured bicycles, 
hitchhike or walk. There are similar chronic problems with 
fitful elevators, water, electricity, and telephone service.</p>

<p>The "si se puede" spirit may be part of the Cuban character - 
but it is also organized by grassroots leaders like Maria 
Ducas Megret. In March 1993, Cuba held its first elections 
for municipal and national "Assemblies of People's Power." 
Maria Ducas Megret was elected to both the Municipal 
Assembly in Havana and the National Assembly representing 
the Marianao municipality, a neighborhood in west Havana 
where she lives.</p>

<p>"Our aim was to create a structure that would be closer to 
the population so that we could be more effective in helping 
solve the problems faced by the people," she said as she led 
my interpreter and me on a walking tour of her district.</p>

<p>Judging by the reception Ducas received from her 
constituents, Cuba's brand of grassroots democracy is 
working well. Everyone seemed to know her and rushed to 
embrace her.</p>

<p>Dominating Marianao is a sprawling former military base, the 
Columbia Fortress, built by the U.S. after the defeat of 
Spain in 1898. When Cuba's Revolutionary Army liberated 
Havana in January 1959, this was dictator Fulgencio 
Batista's last stronghold.</p>

<p>After it fell, the fort was renamed Ciudad Libertad (Freedom 
City). The barracks were converted into schools, a newly-
constructed pediatric hospital, day care centers and a 
senior citizen center. Also located here is a teacher's 
college and Cuba's School of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>The afternoon we visited, it was teeming with children 
enjoying after-school programs - sports, art, music and 
dance. Some children were demonstrating their skills with 
watercolors and pastels. Others were working with clay 
fashioning plates and bowls. A chorus of Young Pioneers sang 
patriotic songs and performed group dances.</p>

<p>Gretel Gil, 12, showed me the plate she had made with an 
excellent likeness of Jose Marti glazed into its surface. 
"Jose Marti made speeches in Tampa and New York City calling 
for Cuba's independence," she told me. "He died fighting for 
freedom because we were ruled first by Spain and then the 
U.S."</p>

<p>Maria Ducas took us to a residential neighborhood in 
Marianao where a group of volunteers, with the assistance of 
an architect and journeyman construction workers, built 
their own cinderblock apartment building, the Pilar House. 
Materials to construct the house were provided by the 
government.</p>

<p>The housing shortage is so acute that every one of the eight 
apartments is already furnished, decorated and occupied. The 
roof is a spacious patio that commands a panorama of the 
entire neighborhood. People from throughout Havana are now 
coming to learn the Marianao brigade's building methods.</p>

<p>We walked two blocks to the home of Rita Rios, another 
neighborhood activist. It was after dark by now but the 
house was packed with community residents who had gathered 
to welcome me. It included artists who use the Rios home as 
an art gallery and children who are studying dance at a 
neighborhood ballet school.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Rios learned that the celebrated Cuban 
artist Wifredo Lam had lived in her home from 1941 to 1945 
and had painted some of his greatest masterpieces there. 
Rios launched a campaign to restore the house. </p>

<p>Residents have joined in the campaign - typical of the type 
of grassroots initiative the "Assemblies of People's Power" 
seeks to stimulate. "The revolution gave me this house and I 
decided that I must give something back," Rios told me. "I 
am a revolutionary."</p>

<p>Havana's Spanish-style mansions date as early as the 16th 
century. They are decorated with fluted marble columns, 
ornate lintels and arches, wrought iron, stained glass and 
graceful porticos. The beauty is compounded by the lush 
semi-tropical vegetation-palm trees, blooming hibiscus and 
bougainvillea.</p>

<p>The climate is so balmy that few houses have glass windows. 
Most are fitted with louvered shutters. Open them and soft 
breezes warmed by the Gulf stream flow through the houses on 
a November afternoon. Yet many of Havana's lovely dwellings 
are crumbling because of shortages of building materials. </p>

<p>Here, too, I found a determined fightback. I went to the 
Maqueta de la Capital (Model of the Capital) in the Miramar 
municipality of Havana. This is a vast room-sized model of 
the city which enables the people to get a bird's-eye view 
of their city. Miguel Coyula, an architect who works with 
the Group for the Reconstruction of the Capital, a designer 
of the model, told me they are drawing up a plan for the 
restoration of the city, in part to make Havana a premier 
destination for tourism.</p>

<p>"Havana is a living museum," he told me. "The elite did not 
destroy their homes to build new ones. They simply abandoned 
them and moved further west. Now they live in Florida. So 
all the architectural monuments of the past are still 
standing, ready to be restored."</p>

Already, reconstruction has begun in Old Havana. "Part of my 
job is liaison with neighborhoods, to encourage the people 
who live there to join in the effort to restore their 
communities."</p>

<p>I told him we had just visited Wifredo Lam's house in 
Marianao. "Oh," he exclaimed, his eyes brightening. "Did you 
meet Maria Ducas? She is wonderful! The Wifredo Lam house is 
the kind of restoration project we are trying to encourage."</p>

<p>I traveled to the Antero Regalado cooperative farm near San 
Antonio de los Banos where Israeli-designed cultivation 
houses are used to produce big succulent tomatoes - part of 
the drive to dramatically increase the supply of vegetables 
for the Cuban people. Here, too, the "Si se puede" principal 
was in force.</p>

<p>There are no spare parts for the cooperative's fleet of 
aging Soviet tractors. Nivalbo Ortega, president of the co-
op, showed me the machine shop with an aging turret lathe, 
drill press, and other machine tools where they manufacture 
spare parts. "Before the revolution, we had millions of 
hectares of land that served only the needs of the wealthy," 
he told me. "Now our task is to guarantee a balanced diet 
for the Cuban people."</p>

<p>The 283-hectare co-op with 140 members produces vegetables 
that are sold to Acopio, the state agricultural marketing 
monopoly for distribution. Some of the tomatoes are 
earmarked for the restaurants in Cuba's spanking new hotels 
- part of the integrated economic complex to serve Cuba's 
new tourist industry.</p>

<p>The Saturday before my departure, I was driven 100 miles 
east to Varadero Beach, its white sandy peninsula curving 
for miles into the Florida Gulf. Warmed by the Gulf stream, 
the water's are a brilliant turquoise blue.</p>

<p>The DuPont family once owned much of Varadero and their 
mansion is still standing. But the commanding presence in 
Varadero today is the Cuban Communist Party. A big sign on 
the facade of the modern party headquarters proclaims 
"Patria o Muerte."</p>

<p>Armando Castaneda and Osmany Almeida, two regional Party 
leaders, are assigned to oversee this bold foray into joint 
ventures with foreign corporations. Spanish, Italian, 
German, French, Canadian and Mexican corporations have 
flocked to Varadero. Jointly with Cuba they have built a 
necklace of five-star luxury hotels along Varadero Beach 
that are now filling up with thousands of tourists from 
Canada, Latin America and Europe.</p>

<p>So far, 8,000 hotel room have been completed by 10,000 Cuban 
construction workers. Another 20,000 workers are employed in 
other parts of the tourist industry in Varadero. Profits are 
split 50-50 and Cuba retains ultimate ownership of the 
properties.</p>

<p>"DuPont owned much of this and now the DuPonts are claiming 
it under the Helms-Burton law," said Castaneda with a 
chuckle. "The U.S. is losing, of course. The longer the 
blockade exists, the more behind they get. When they awake 
from their dreams, there won't be any space left for joint 
ventures with U.S. companies."</p>

<p>It is not possible to take the measure of a nation and its 
people in one brief week. Yet there were so many poignant 
impressions I took home with me. I did not hear a single 
angry exchange between Cubans in the streets despite all the 
obvious hardships they face.</p>

<p>Cuba is a remarkably multiracial society with Black, white 
and brown peoples living and working side-by-side. There is 
none of the racist segregation that divides our 
neighborhoods and schools.</p>

<p>Pedro Ross Leal, a Cuban of African descent, is the 
president of the Cuban Labor Federation, a member of the 
ruling Council of State (equivalent to a cabinet minister). 
He granted me an interview and then took me to a celebration 
of the 35th anniversary of the founding of Cuba's Public 
Employees Union.</p>

<p>As we entered the meeting hall, he handed me a lapel button. 
It read, "Yo creo en la solidaridad" (I believe in 
solidarity). The buttons had been sent by a sister union in 
Puerto Rico. Solidarity seems to be a way of life in Cuba 
and a big rock in the way of those who would destroy the 
Cuban people's power.</p>
