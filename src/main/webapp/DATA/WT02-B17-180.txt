<h2>New WATERGY Program Estimates Savings From Water Conservation Measures</h2>

The WATERGY program is a spreadsheet model that uses water-energy
relationship assumptions to analyze the potential of water savings
and associated energy savings.  The spreadsheet allows input of
utility data (energy and water cost and consumption data for the
most recent twelve months) and facility data (the number and kind
of water consuming/moving devices and their water consumption
and/or flow rates).  It then calculates annual direct water, direct
energy, and indirect energy savings, as well as total cost and
payback periods for a number of conservation methods, including:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>1.6 gal/flush toilets and water conserving urinals;
<LI>Automatic faucets;
<LI>Faucet aerators;
<LI>Low flow showerheads;
<LI>Efficient dishwashers;
<LI>Efficient washing machines;
<LI>Boiler blowdown optimization; and
<LI>Landscape irrigation optimization.
</UL>
Most of the assumptions that WATERGY uses for energy/water calculations
can be grouped into the following categories: 
<UL>
<LI>the heating values of fuels; 
<LI>the efficiencies of energy and water consuming devices
or processes (e.g., number of kilowatt hours consumed per gallon
for electric hot water heaters, or number of kilowatt hours consumed
per 1,000 gallons of treated waste water);
<LI>time-of-use for fixtures (e.g.,  number of minutes per
use of infra-red sensor faucets); and percentage of hot water
use in machines or fixtures (e.g., percentage of water usage that
is hot water for a typical faucet).
</UL>
WATERGY also makes simple assumptions about capital and labor
costs of equipment and fixture replacements.  All assumptions
WATERGY applies can be modified by the user.
