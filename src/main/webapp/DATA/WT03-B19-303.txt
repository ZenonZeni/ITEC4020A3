<P>
The Centre for Alloy and Solidification Technology (CAST) was established in 1992 to develop casting technology for aluminium and magnesium alloys, particularly those aimed at the automotive industry.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The core research program of CAST is concerned with solidification, process technology for casting, tooling and prototyping technology, and alloy performance. The research is undertaken at three laboratories in Melbourne and Brisbane and involves about 80 CSIRO, Comalco and University personnel.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Australia has significant high-quality magnesium and aluminium resources. The country is already a net exporter of cast aluminium auto parts and its automotive casting industry is world competitive.
The world market for aluminium components is expected to double during the decade because of the need to decrease the weight of cars in order to meet legislative requirements for reduced fuel consumption and lower exhaust emissions. The currently small market for magnesium components is expected to grow at an even greater rate.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
A major participant is in Melbourne - CSIRO's Division of Manufacturing Technology. The Division has pilot plant facilities for both high pressure and low pressure die casting and offers a comprehensive design and prototyping service.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The Centre aims to provide the light alloy casting industry with skilled personnel at levels ranging from technicians and operators to engineers, researchers and managers. About 25 University of Queensland postgraduate students are supported by the centre. Several short courses are conducted annually.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
CAST is a joint venture between The University of Queensland, CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology, Comalco Research Centre, Comalco Foundry Products, the Australian Automotive Technology Centre and the Australian Magnesium Research and Development Project.
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
CAST's Design and Prototyping Service helps business optimise designs for aluminium and magnesium castings and to make functional prototypes. The methods and technologies aim to provide the lightest weight castings consistent with strength and cost requirements. The latest computer-aided design and prototyping technology is used.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The net annual worth of CAST's research is approximately $8 million. This amount is made up of in-kind inputs from the University and CSIRO, the Australian Government's CRC grant of $2 million per year, other grants and industry funds.
