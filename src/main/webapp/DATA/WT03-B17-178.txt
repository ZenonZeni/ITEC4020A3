<P>
<B>1. The taxonomic analysis of Calanus.</B>
<P>
Initially gelatinous zooplankton are removed from the samples
and their displacement volume measured. The larger animals (euphausiids,
amphipods, caridea and fish larvae) are then removed and counted
from whole samples. <I>Calanus</I> should be the target species.
However, in certain areas there is a mixture of two <I>Calanus</I>
species which may be difficult to discriminate <I>(C. finmarchicus/C.
helgolandicus </I>or<I> C. finmarchicus/C. glacialis</I>). Before
starting the stageing, the following check should be done:<BR>
<P>
1) In areas where it is likely that there is a mixture of <I>C.
finmarchicus</I> and <I>C. helgolandicus</I>: Before starting
the sub-sampling and stageing, 20 adult females and 20 C5 Calanus
should be identified to species level, or all of either stage
present in the sample if &lt;20 are available. <BR>
<P>
If the 40 specimens are either all <I>C. finmarchicus</I> or all
C<I>. helgolandicus</I>, the 40 identified specimens are then
replaced in the sample before sub-sampling. However, if the species
determination of the 40 specimens show more than one <I>Calanus</I>
species to be present in the sample, then 20 male <I>Calanus</I>
should also be identified to species level
<P>
Then after replacing the specimens in the sample, sub-sampling,
counts and stage identification should be made. If there are &lt;2-300
<I>Calanus</I> in a sample then all specimens should be examined.
If there are &gt;2-300 <I>Calanus</I> then a sub-sample containing
at least 100 <I>Calanus</I> should be examined. Counts should
be made for each of adult females, males and copepodite stages
C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5.<BR>
<P>
2) In areas where it is likely that there is an admixture of <I>C.
finmarchicus, C. glacialis</I> and/or <I>C. hyperboreus</I>: Before
starting the sub-sampling and stageing, 100 individuals should
be identified to stage and measured for cephalothorax lengths.
Species identification is made according to length criteria (see
Hirche et al. 1994, Unstad &amp; Tande 1991).The 100 specimens
are replaced in the sample, and subsampling and counts should
be made exactly as above. If <I>C. glacialis</I> or <I>C. hyperboreus</I>
are found in the samples, the first three stages should be recorded
as belonging to <I>Calanus</I> spp. (i.e. <I>Calanus</I> spp.
CI, <I>Calanus</I> spp. CII, <I>Calanus</I> spp. CIII), while
the remaining instars should be assigned to species.<BR>
<P>
3) True <I>C. finmarchicus</I> samples should be separately flagged
in the archive lists.<BR>
<P>
Analysis results for archiving should show for each sample:
<P>
1. Sample Identifier (to relate to a separate record of sampling),
calculated Volume of sea sampled (m<SUP>3</SUP>) and Analyst Name.
<P>
2. Species Separation data by stage and species as counts totalling
20 each for females, C5 and males where more than a single species
is found, or actual numbers where &lt;20 specimens are available.
<P>
3. Volumes proportions of Sub-sample and Sample (eg. 10/250 ml
or 1 if total sample).
<P>
4. The species and stages and associated counts, calculated to
numbers per sample
<P>
5. Number measured, followed by Lengths and Stage data.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>2. CTD</B>
<P>
Data on temperature and salinity from CTD should be calibrated
regularly with water sampling bottles. The salinity should be
analysed according to ICES standards. For those who currently
do not meet the ICES standards, please consult &quot;Processing
of oceanographic station data, Unesco, 1991&quot;, or contact
Dr. Garry Hopwood, ICES (garry@server.ices.dk).<BR>
<P>
<B>3. Measurements of egg production.</B>
<P>
Where possible, live tows should be slow vertical tows from a
standard depth (ca. 60 m) not taking more than 15 minutes. Longer
tows result in more dead animals. The catch is gently diluted
and transferred into c. 10-20 l plastic bucket. This water must
be in situ surface water, at least at ambient temperature and
preferably slightly chilled. Any warming of copepods results in
premature release of eggs per females. We recommend &quot;Cool-packs&quot;
easily available plastic ice blocks which can be used to chill
the water and keep it cool. Seawater frozen in strong polythene
bags also works. Plastic materials such as Cool-packs and any
new plastic bucket etc., should be soaked in seawater for 24 hours
prior to use to leach out any chemicals.<BR>
<P>
Samples are immediately taken from the plastic bucket and transferred
to Petri dishes. Females in good condition are sorted out using
a stereomicroscope with cold stage and a pipette. The females
are then placed into egg production chambers pre-filled with sieved
(90 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m) surface water. One female is
added to each chamber and if possible 30 replicates should be
done per station. The egg production chambers should be equipped
with mesh (300-500 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m) false bottoms
to separate eggs from females. Containers are then suspended in
at least 250 ml beakers or other containers with a closed top
for running water incubation. <BR>
<P>
The chambers are incubated a) on deck in water bath with flowing
surface water or b) in a constant temperature room at the ambient
surface water temperature. The light should be dim, not exceeding
the ambient illumination at 5 m depth at the sampling station.
<BR>
<P>
The incubation time should be 24 hours, or up to 48 h at low temperatures
(&lt;5<SUP>o</SUP> C). Incubations are terminated by filtering
onto a 20 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m screen, which is immediately
preserved in 4% formaline. The number of eggs on the screen may
be counted immediately or later on land, under a stereomicroscope.
The incubated female is measured (cephalothorax length) and preserved
in 4% formaldehyde. Fecundity is expressed as the number of eggs
produced per day.<BR>
<P>
<B>4. Measurements of gut fluorescence</B>
<P>
<U>Gut content:</U> The cod-end content from a live tow is diluted
and gently rinsed onto 200 um sieve with chilled and fine-filtered
(&lt;1 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m) seawater to remove debris
and any cells that may adhere to the animals. The sieve is kept
submerged at all times. A portion of the sample is placed in a
cryotube, wrapped in aluminium foil, and frozen immediately (-20<SUP>o</SUP>
C or lower), preferably in liquid nitrogen.<BR>
<P>
Further analysis is made in the laboratory within one month after
collection: A portion of the contents of the Petri dish is allowed
to thaw for 5-10 minutes in the dark. 10 individuals of <I>Calanus
finmarchicus</I> are picked out under dim light and placed in
small tubes with 5 ml of 90% acetone (at least 5 replicates).
The tubes are capped and kept chilled in the dark for at least
1.5 hours for extraction (Huntley et al. 1987). Homogenization
or crushing of the sample is not necessary according to Simrad
et al (1985), Kleppel et al. (1988) and Morales et al (1990).
<P>
The fluorescence of the extract is measured before and after acidification
with 10% HCl in a Turner Designs Model 10 Fluorometer (calibrated
with pure chlorophyll a). Gut pigment content is calculated using
the modified formulas of Strickland &amp; Parsons (1968). The
results are expressed as total gut pigment content (chlorophyll
a equivalent). Ingestion rates are calculated according to the
formula I = S * R, where S is the mean gut pigment (ng chlorophyll
a equivalents ind<SUP>-1</SUP>) and R is the gut evacuation rate
constant (time<SUP>-1</SUP>) as estimated from the gut evacuation
experiments.<BR>
<P>
<U>Gut evacuation experiment:</U> The cod-end content from a live
tow is diluted and gently rinsed onto 200 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m
sieve with chilled and fine-filtered (&lt;1 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m)
seawater. The sample is transferred to a 50 l container filled
with filtered seawater. The container is placed in the dark in
a water bath with ambient temperature from which the animals were
collected. Where many animals are present some gentle aeration
or mixing may be reqired. Dead and decaying animals are excluded
by careful siphoning. Subsequent subsampling from the container
takes place at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 240 minutes
after collection, and frozen immediately as described above. A
final sample is taken after 24 hours as a value on background
fluorescence. Further analysis is made in the laboratory as described
above, within one month after collection.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>5. Egg hatching success</B>
<P>
In connection with the egg production measurements, an additional
5-10 females are incubated solely for viability experiments. Incubations
are carried out at ambient temperature in standard 6 well (15
ml) tissue culture plates. Females are individually incubated
in the wells for 24 hours. Then females are removed. Eggs are
counted and kept in the chambers for further incubation. The incubated
female is measured (cephalothorax length) and preserved in 4%
formaldehyde. Incubation of eggs is terminated after 72 hours
by pipetting the eggs onto a 20 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m
screen which is immediately preserved in 4% formaline. The number
of unhatched eggs and hatched nauplii on the screen may be counted
immediately or later on land, under a stereomicroscope. Alternatively,
the use of neutral red as a vital stain, will stain live and dead
eggs differently, and allows the normally transparent eggs and
nauplii to be counted more easily. Use of video or silhouette
photgraphy may allow recording for later analysis of such experiments.

<B>6. Mesh size in nets for quantitative sampling</B>
<P>
The specific mesh size used by different partners, depends on
the equipment available at the different institutions. However,
standard mesh size for quantitative sampling should be in the
range of 180 - 200 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m.<BR>
