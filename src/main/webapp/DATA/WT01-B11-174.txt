<B>WORKING AROUND WATER?<BR>
What you should know about Fish Habitat and Dredging

<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Shoreline waters are home to hundreds of aquatic species including fish.  The nearshore area is where fish lay their eggs, feed, and seek protection from predators.  Changes to these areas can threaten their survival. <P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources' goal is to maintain and improve the quality of fish habitat so that fish will continue to have healthy places to live.  If you own or lease waterfront property, you can help protect the fish in your lake or river by protecting fish habitat along your waterfront.<P>
	
Dredging is the removal or displacement of any material from the bottom of a lake or stream.  It can destroy the areas that fish need to live, breed and feed.  If you want to dredge a large area, there is a good chance you will harm fish habitat.  In addition your dredging project can stir up the material on the bottom of your lake or river, and this may affect water quality for you and your neighbours.<P> 

If you decide to dredge, you will need to take special care to preserve fish habitat.  This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to dredge.  It outlines when a work permit under the Public Lands Act is required.  For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for dredging.  If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases.<P><BR>

<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land.  Historically, any project which involved dredging on this land or on shorelands (defined as the area below the high water mark) required a work permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recent legislative changes remove the requirement for a work permit for some dredging projects.  Listed below are the projects that do, and do not require a permit under this legislation.<P>

Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau Canal or Trent-Severn Waterway, these areas are under <B>Federal</B> jurisdiction.  Approval for in-water and shoreline works in these areas will be granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.<P>

<LI><B>Dredging projects which will not require a work permit:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>installing a water line, cable, or heat loop for private use<BR> (i.e. a single cottage or residence);

<LI>log salvage; and

<LI>submarine cables where laid on lake or river bottom.  
</UL><P>
<LI><B>Dredging projects that WILL require a work permit:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>boat channels or swimming areas;

<LI>installing a water line, heat loop or cable for commercial use (i.e. a waterline or heat loop for a lodge, marina, resort or large scale development); and

<LI>Removing rocks/boulders, from shorelands or the bottom of the lakes or stream, to fill a crib or to create a beach.
</UL>
</OL><P>
Projects that require a work permit can pose a significant risk to fish habitat.  To assess the impact of your project on the environment, MNR may visit the site.  This takes time, so submit your application early.   You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. <P>  

You may also need other additional approvals (e.g. Conservation Authorities).    Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency. <P><BR> 

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water containing fish.  Violations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and a requirement to cover the costs of returning the site to its original state.<P>

Dredging can effect water quality and destroy those areas that fish and wildlife live. Before deciding to dredge, consider the cost of the project and the cost of maintenance.  Also consider if there are alternatives.  For example, could you drive your boat around that shoal, stump or rock, or use an offshore mooring or swimming raft?<P><BR>

<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following best management practices will help to ensure that your dredging project will minimize harm to fish habitat and ensure that the federal Fisheries Act is not violated. <P> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Dredging methods:</B>  Many methods are available for dredging.  These include removing material by hand or shovel, and mechanical methods such as a backhoe or other heavy equipment.  The preferred methods from a fish habitat perspective are hand removal and shoveling.<P>  

<LI><B>How much to remove:</B> The size of the area you may dredge depends on your project type and the conditions in your waterfront site.  Factors include the fish species present, the habitat at the site, the type of substrate, and the reasons why you are dredging.<P>

	For those dredging projects that do not require a permit (e.g. dredging to install a private water line, or heat loop) minimize the size and depth of the area to be dredged.<P> 
	
	Generally, those types of activities that require a permit (dredging for a boat channel or swimming/beach area) pose a high risk to fish habitat.  The size of the area to be dredged should be kept to a minimum.  For example, dredging for a single boat channel should be no wider than six metres.<P>  

	A boat channel can be shared among adjacent property owners.  For safety reasons, shared or community boat channels need to be wider than single channels.  In most cases, community channels should not exceed eight metres in width.<P>  

	If you need a work permit, the permit will specify the area that can be dredged.<P>    

<LI><B>Disposal of the dredge material:</B>  If the dredged material is made up of material that will not be transported by wave action, (e.g. gravel, rocks, boulders), it is a good idea to redistribute this material in the area immediately adjacent to the site on the lake/stream bottom.  These materials provide excellent places for fish to lay their eggs, hide, and feed.  Therefore by placing this material back into the lake (near the original site) you are moving that excellent fish habitat to another spot.  Just be sure that you are not creating a navigational hazard.<P>  

If however the materials are fine (silt, sand, clay),  then all dredged material must be disposed of on land, and it must be suitably contained to prevent it from washing back into the water.   Fine dredged material such as silt and sand can cover the areas that fish need to feed and reproduce.  In addition these fine materials can affect water quality so you must ensure that the dredged material does not enter your neighbour's property. It is a good idea to cover the trench or dredged area with gravel or cobble material.  Gravel/ cobble is stable and will not be transported by wave action.  It is also very good fish habitat.<P>  

If you require a work permit you should outline, in your work permit application form, specifically where the dredged material will be placed.<P>  

You cannot dispose of dredged material in open waters unless you have special authorization from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.  In some cases you may also require approval from the Canadian Coast Guard.  If you get approval, a series of rigorous chemical tests must be done to ensure the dredged material will not harm the water quality.  You will be required to pay for these tests.<P>  

<LI><B>Timing is critical:</B> In-water dredging activity should not occur during the fish spawning and nursery period since it could kill eggs and young fish.  If you are planning, in-water construction activities, contact your local district office for details on timing your project to minimize impacts on the aquatic environment. <P>  

If your project requires a permit, the permit will specify the exact time of dredging.<P>  

<LI><B>Maintain or preserve bankside or shoreline vegetation.</B>  Shrubs and trees growing adjacent to lakes and streams are important.  This vegetation provides overhead cover for fish, shade to minimize warming of the water, and a source of food for fish as insects fall off the vegetation into the water.  Near-shore vegetation also provides benefits to wildlife in the form of nesting sites, cover from predators, etc.  In addition, the vegetation can help stabilize the soils in the area thereby minimizing erosion.<P>  

The removal of some vegetation adjacent to the waterbody may be necessary to allow access of equipment.  All areas should be stabilized to prevent erosion and replanted as soon as possible.<P> 

<LI><B>Avoid areas with aquatic plants.</B>  Aquatic plants play an important role in the ecology of shoreline areas.  Where possible, avoid dredging in these areas.  If you must dredge in these areas contact your local office of the Ministry of Natural Resources.  You may need authorization through the work permit process to remove aquatic vegetation.<P> 

<LI><B>Avoid spawning and nursery areas.</B> If you suspect your property is adjacent to a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike or muskellunge, we advise you to either talk to staff at your local MNR office, or have your project approved by an environmental consultant before you dredge.  These fish species often have only one spawning/nursery site in the waterbody.  Any in-water construction activity near these sites could affect fish habitat and result in fewer fish.<P>  
 
<LI><B>Protect water quality:</B> A sediment or silt screen should be installed around the work area prior to starting.  After the work is completed, the screen should be carefully removed after all of the sediment has settled on the lake bottom.<P>  

Work in the water on calm days.  This will help prevent the suspension of fine sediment particles into the water column by wave action and will ensure the silt screen is not disturbed by wave action.<P><BR>
