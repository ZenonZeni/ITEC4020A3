<p align="center"><b>Drug Watch International And The DEA Combine
Forces To Kill<br>
Colorado Hemp Bill With Two Powerful Weapons: Lies And Threats</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Denver, CO, Colorado's Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Energy voted down Senate Bill
132, the Colorado Hemp Production Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by state senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
sought to 1.) establish a commission to study hemp as a cash crop
and the federal laws governing hemp cultivation [Similar to the
commission recently established by Kentucky's governor. -ed.],
and 2.) create a 'vehicle' for the establishment of a legal hemp
industry in Colorado.&nbsp; The measures were voted down 4-3 and 6-1
respectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While it is unfortunate that the citizens of Colorado are
temporarily unable to enjoy the economic benefits of a legal hemp
industry, the most disturbing aspect of these hearings was the apparent
impact of testimony provided by The Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) and Drug Watch International (DWI)
[prohibitionist organization -ed.]. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, DWI representative Beverly Kinard gave bizarre testimony
that included wild misrepresentations about hemp production, the
health effects associated with marijuana use and the groups and
individuals who advocate changing the laws governing marijuana.
Some of Mrs. Kinard's more notable direct quotes follow: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Dutch National Board of Drug Prevention is extremely
    concerned because even with low THC marijuana, high
    concentrations of THC may be produced in some organs.&nbsp;
    [There is no such office entitled the &quot;Dutch National Board
    of Drug Prevention&quot;. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Legalizing drugs in the Netherlands brought the crime rate
    up 400%.&nbsp; [&quot;Drugs&quot; are not legal in Holland
    and the violent crime rate has declined over The last 12 years.
    -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Hemp oil [derived from marijuana seeds -ed.] causes skin
    cancer overnight on laboratory rats.&nbsp; [Hemp seed oil is
    sold in health food stores. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Marijuana affects every cell, every system and every organ
    in the body. The mental disorders include acute toxic
    psychosis, panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions,
    depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia, depression and UNCONTROLLABLE
    HOSTILITY.&nbsp; [Emphasis not added!&nbsp; If so, why has violent
    crime declined in Holland? -ed.] 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While NORML contends that nearly all of Mrs. Kinard's testimony
was nonsensical, the DEA proved DWI one better.&nbsp; Special
Agent in Charge of the DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division, Philip
W. Perry, testified that the DEA strongly opposes any
democratically-inspired challenges to their supreme control of
marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; In his written testimony, Agent
Perry asserts that &quot;In cases where federal and state law are
in opposition, the question of which law would control is well
settled.&quot;&nbsp; Agent Perry felt it necessary to reiterate
for the committee: &quot;Let us be clear that what we are talking
about in this Bill is marijuana.&nbsp; Calling it
&quot;hemp&quot; on the basis of an artificial threshold level of
psychoactive ingredient does not erase the fact that it is
botanically and legally the same plant.&quot;&nbsp; [Yes, that is
exactly the point! -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Agent Perry concluded by forcefully reasserting the federal
government's recalcitrant position regarding hemp and even more
bizarre, his interpretation of the parental-like role of federal
law enforcement: &quot;Although I am not an expert in the
economics of crop production [question: why then are you
testifying in an agriculture committee hearing? -ed.]...With 31
years of service in law enforcement...I can tell you, in my
professional opinion, this legislation is no more than a shallow ruse
being advanced by those who seek to legalize marijuana.&nbsp; The
people of Colorado deserve to be protected from this sort of
subterfuge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such
protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's
command.&quot; [Emphasis added. -ed.] 

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on this legislative debacle, including
copies of the DWI and DEA's tendentious written testimonies,
please contact Allen St. Pierre, NORML, 202-483-5500.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>DEA's Next Target: Hawaii</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 13, Kailua-Kona, In a letter from the mayor of Hawaii
County to the DEA, Mayor Stephen K. Yamashiro's executive
assistant asserted that the Mayor is totally supportive of hemp activist
Roger Christie's efforts to establish a legal hemp industry on
Hawaii. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Executive Assistant R.B. Legaspi writes, in part, that Mr.
Christie has secured the Mayor's endorsement and that &quot;The
Mayor [has] offered the use of county lands for an experimental
project growing low grade hemp for commercial purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his letter, Mr. Legaspi pointed out to the DEA that this past
June 7, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919, which
amongst other things, recognizes hemp as a &quot;Food
Resource&quot;. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter concludes with a reiteration, &quot;Mayor Yamashiro
does endorse...the cultivation of hemp and its conversion to
products useful to mankind.&quot;&nbsp; [Editor's note: Despite
the Mayor's pragmatism and support, the County of Hawaii is not
going to be able to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The DEA will
likely employ the same heavy-handed tactics that it successfully
used in the above cited case in Colorado and deny Mr. Christie
his permit needed to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The disproportional
level of influence and power the DEA asserts over
democratically-elected local and state officials is a clear
violation of the 9th and 10th Amendments.] </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For further information on Hawaii's efforts to legalize hemp
production, please contact either activist Roger Christie,
808-961-0488 or Mayor Stephen K. Yamashiro, 808-961-8211.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Top U.S. General Says The U.S.'s
Multibillion - Dollar 'Drug War'<br>
Has Accomplished Little</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, The Associated Press (AP) reported that Gen.
Barry R. McCafferey recently told law makers that despite a well
organized and costly-counter-drug operation, &quot;these current
efforts are not achieving their purpose. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;A multiyear effort involving substantial resources and
enormous energy and creativity,&quot; McCafferey said, &quot;has
not had the effects we desired.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">AP reports that McCafferey portrayed an insatiable drug market
able to adapt to law enforcement agencies by quickly changing
drug routes and methods of production. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gen. McCafferey acknowledged the difficulty of tackling the drug
problem, but like any true believer he concluded: &quot;I Think
part of the problem has been our decision to call it a war...I
prefer to think of it as a cancer.&nbsp; I don't think about
achieving victory but about dealing with the problem.&quot;&nbsp;
[NORML's National Director Richard Cowan's comment: &quot;With
this kind of mentality, America will always be engaged in a
&quot;drug war&quot; until we die of the cancer of prohibition
-ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>The New York Times Magazine Runs A Very High
Times-Type Article</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 19, The <i>New York Times Magazine</i> ran a lengthy
cover article entitled &quot;Marijuana in the 90's&quot;.&nbsp;
The article examined indoor marijuana cultivation from the point
of view of an avid gardener [Writer Michael Pollan is Harper
Magazine's gardening editor. -ed.].&nbsp; The article examines
and rightly lays blame for the phenomenal explosion of indoor
marijuana cultivation at the U.S. government's feet.&nbsp; The
article extensively examines the economics of contraband both in
the U.S. and The Netherlands.&nbsp; The pictures alone are
amazing.&nbsp; This is a must read article! </p>
