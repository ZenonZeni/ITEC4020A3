This course is currently available as three options: Microbiology, Quality Assurance and Process Engineering. <i> However, the Microbiology option is no longer being offered to new applicants.</i><P>

The first option is suitable for honours graduates in microbiology, bacteriology or another appropriate science; the second option is suitable for honours graduates in pure or applied science; the third option is suitable for honours graduates in engineering, technology or an appropriate science. A candidate who does not possess such qualifications may be required to complete a one year, ad hoc course before admission to the MSc course. The common syllabus includes selected aspects of food chemistry, statistics, computing and management.<P>

All students carry out a project or dissertation.<P>


<EM>Microbiology option</EM><P>

This option deals with bacteriology and mycology, and involves studies of microbial spoilage of food, the microbiology of food preservation, the utilisation of micro-organisms in food and allied processing, food hygiene and the detection of pathogens in food.<P>

<EM>Quality Assurance option</EM><P>

This option includes studies of the principles of quality assurance and quality management, statistical aspects of quality assurance, food legislation, methods of examination of raw materials and processed foods, chemical analysis of nutrients, additives and contaminants.<P>

<EM>Process Engineering option</EM><P>

This option comprises of studies of the principles of process engineering, such as fluid flow, heat transfer, thermodynamics and control, and their application to industrial food processing operations including canning, freezing and drying. Relevant unit operations, including centrifugation, filtration etc are also studied.<P>

<EM>Assessment</EM><P>

Assessment consists of reports of practical and assignments undertaken during the year, a written examination and a project report or dissertation.<P>
