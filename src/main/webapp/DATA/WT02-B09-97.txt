<h2>Sick Building Syndrome</h2>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>The term &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; (SBS) is used to describe
situations in which building occupants experience acute health and comfort
effects that appear to be linked to time spent in a building, but no specific
illness or cause can be identified. The complaints may be localized in
a particular room or zone, or may be widespread throughout the building.In
contrast, the term &quot;building related illness&quot; (BRI) is used when
symptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributed directly
to airborne building contaminants.</p>

<p>A 1984 World Health Organization Committee report suggested that up
to 30 percent of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be the subject
of excessive complaints related to indoor air quality (IAQ). Often this
condition is temporary, but some buildings have long-term problems.Frequently,
problems result when a building is operated or maintained in a manner that
is inconsistent with its original design or prescribed operating procedures.
Sometimes indoor air problems are a result of poor building design or occupant
activities. </p>

<p>Indicators of SBS include: </p>

<ol>
<li>Building occupants complain of symptoms associated with acute discomfort,
e.g., headache; eye, nose, or throat irritation; dry cough; dry or itchy
skin; dizziness and nausea; difficulty in concentrating; fatigue; and sensitivity
to odors.</li>

<li>The cause of the symptoms is not known.</li>

<li>Most of the complainants report relief soon after leaving the building.</li>
</ol>

<p>Indicators of BRI include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building occupants complain of symptoms such as cough; chest tightness;
fever, chills; and muscle aches.</li>

<li>The symptoms can be clinically defined and have clearly identifiable
causes.</li>

<li>Complainants may require prolonged recovery times after leaving the
building. </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that complaints may result from other causes.
These may include an illness contracted outside the building, acute sensitivity
(e.g., allergies), job related stress or dissatisfaction, and other psychosocial
factors. Nevertheless, studies show that symptoms may be caused or exacerbated
by indoor air quality problems.</p>

<p><b>Causes of Sick Building Syndrome</b></p>

<p>The following have been cited causes of or contributing factors to sick
building syndrome:</p>

<p><b>Inadequate ventilation</b>: In the early and mid 1900's, building
ventilation standards called for approximately 15 cubic feet per minute
(cfm) of outside air for each building occupant, primarily to dilute and
remove body odors. As a result of the 1973 oil embargo, however, national
energy conservation measures called for a reduction in the amount of outdoor
air provided for ventilation to 5 cfm per occupant. In many cases these
reduced outdoor air ventilation rates were found to be inadequate to maintain
the health and comfort of building occupants. Inadequate ventilation, which
may also occur if heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
do not effectively distribute air to people in the building, is thought
to be an important factor in SBS. In an effort to achieve acceptable IAQ
while minimizing energy consumption, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recently revised its ventilation
standard to provide a minimum of 15 cfm of outdoor air per person (20 cfm/person
in office spaces). Up to 60 cfm/person may be required in some spaces (such
as smoking lounges) depending on the activities that normally occur in
that space (see ASHRAE Standard 62-1989).</p>

<p><b>Chemical contaminants from indoor sources</b>: Most indoor air pollution
comes from sources inside the building. For example, adhesives, carpeting,
upholstery, manufactured wood products, copy machines, pesticides, and
cleaning agents may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including formaldehyde.
Environmental tobacco smoke contributes high levels of VOCs, other toxic
compounds, and respirable particulate matter. Research shows that some
VOCs can cause chronic and acute health effects at high concentrations,
and some are known carcinogens. Low to moderate levels of multiple VOCs
may also produce acute reactions. Combustion products such as carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide, as well as respirable particles, can come from unvented
kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces and gas stoves.
</p>

<p><b>Chemical contaminants from outdoor sources</b>: The outdoor air that
enters a building can be a source of indoor air pollution. For example,
pollutants from motor vehicle exhausts; plumbing vents, and building exhausts
(e.g., bathrooms and kitchens) can enter the building through poorly located
air intake vents, windows, and other openings. In addition, combustion
products can enter a building from a nearby garage.</p>

<p><b>Biological contaminants</b>: Bacteria, molds, pollen, and viruses
are types of biological contaminants. These contaminants may breed in stagnant
water that has accumulated in ducts, humidifiers and drain pans, or where
water has collected on ceiling tiles, carpeting, or insulation. Sometimes
insects or bird droppings can be a source of biological contaminants. Physical
symptoms related to biological contamination include cough, chest tightness,
fever, chills, muscle aches, and allergic responses such as mucous membrane
irritation and upper respiratory congestion. One indoor bacterium, Legionella,
has caused both Legionnaire's Disease and Pontiac Fever.</p>

<p>These elements may act in combination, and may supplement other complaints
such as inadequate temperature, humidity, or lighting. Even after a building
investigation, however, the specific causes of the complaints may remain
unknown. </p>

<p><b>A Word About Radon and Asbestos... </b></p>

<p>SBS and BRI are associated with acute or immediate health problems;
radon and asbestos cause long-term diseases which occur years after exposure,
and are therefore not considered to be among the causes of sick buildings.
This is not to say that the latter are not serious health risks; both should
be included in any comprehensive evaluation of a building's IAQ.</p>

<p><b>Building Investigation Procedures </b></p>

<p>The goal of a building investigation is to identify and solve indoor
air quality complaints in a way that prevents them from recurring and which
avoids the creation of other problems. To achieve this goal, it is necessary
for the investigator(s) to discover whether a complaint is actually related
to indoor air quality, identify the cause of the complaint, and determine
the most appropriate corrective actions.</p>

<p>An indoor air quality investigation procedure is best characterized
as a cycle of information gathering, hypothesis formation, and hypothesis
testing. It generally begins with a walkthrough inspection of the problem
area to provide information about the four basic factors that influence
indoor air quality: 1) the occupants, 2) the HVAC system, 3) possible pollutant
pathways, 4) possible contaminant sources.</p>

<p>Preparation for a walkthrough should include documenting easily obtainable
information about the history of the building and of the complaints; identifying
known HVAC zones and complaint areas; notifying occupants of the upcoming
investigation; and, identifying key individuals needed for information
and access. The walkthrough itself entails visual inspection of critical
building areas and consultation with occupants and staff.</p>

<p>The initial walkthrough should allow the investigator to develop some
possible explanations for the complaint. At this point, the investigator
may have sufficient information to formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis,
and see if the problem is solved. If it is, steps should be taken to ensure
that it does not recur. However, if insufficient information is obtained
from the walk through to construct a hypothesis, or if initial tests fail
to reveal the problem, the investigator should move on to collect additional
information to allow formulation of additional hypoth- eses. The process
of formulating hypotheses, testing them, and evaluating them continues
until the problem is solved. </p>

<p>Although air sampling for contaminants might seem to be the logical
response to occupant complaints, it seldom provides information about possible
causes. While certain basic measurements, e.g., temperature, relative humidity,
CO2, and air movement, can provide a useful &quot;snapshot&quot; of current
building conditions, sampling for specific pollutant concentrations is
often not required to solve the problem and can even be misleading. Contaminant
concentration levels rarely exceed existing standards and guidelines even
when occupants continue to report health complaints. Air sampling should
not be undertaken until considerable information on the factors listed
above has been collected, and any sampling strategy should be based on
a comprehensive understanding of how the build- ing operates and the nature
of the complaints. </p>

<p><b>Solutions to Sick Building Syndrome</b></p>

<p>Solutions to sick building syndrome usually include combinations of
the following:</p>

<p>1) Pollutant source removal or modification is an effective approach
to resolving an IAQ problem when sources are known and control is feasible.
Examples include routine maintenance of HVAC systems, e.g., periodic cleaning
or replacement of filters; replacement of water-stained ceiling tile and
carpeting; institution of smoking restrictions; venting contaminant source
emissions to the outdoors; storage and use of paints, adhesives, solvents,
and pesticides in well ventilated areas, and use of these pollutant sources
during periods of non-occupancy; and allowing time for building materials
in new or remodeled areas to off-gas pollutants before occupancy. Several
of these options may be exercised at one time. </p>

<p>2) Increasing ventilation rates and air distribution often can be a
cost effective means of reducing indoor pollutant levels. HVAC systems
should be designed, at a minimum, to meet ventilation standards in local
building codes; however, many systems are not operated or maintained to
ensure that these design ventilation rates are provided. In many buildings,
IAQ can be improved by operating the HVAC system to at least its design
standard, and to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 if possible. When there are strong
pollutant sources, local exhaust ventilation may be appropriate to exhaust
contaminated air directly from the building. Local exhaust ventilation
is particularly recommended to remove pollutants that accumulate in specific
areas such as rest rooms, copy rooms, and printing facilities. (For a more
detailed discussion of ventilation, read Indoor Air Facts No. 3R, Ventilation
and Air Quality in Office Buildings.) </p>

<p>3) Air cleaning can be a useful adjunct to source control and ventilation
but has certain limitations. Particle control devices such as the typical
furnace filter are inexpensive but do not effectively capture small particles;
high performance air filters capture the smaller, respirable particles
but are relatively expensive to install and operate. Mechanical filters
do not remove gaseous pollutants. Some specific gaseous pollutants may
be removed by adsorbent beds, but these devices can be expensive and require
frequent replacement of the adsorbent material. In sum, air cleaners can
be useful, but have limited application.</p>

<p>Education and communication are important elements in both remedial
and preventive indoor air quality management programs. When building occupants,
management, and maintenance personnel fully communicate and understand
the causes and consequences of IAQ problems, they can work more effectively
together to prevent problems from occurring, or to solve them if they do.
