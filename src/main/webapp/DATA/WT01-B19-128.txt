OFFICIAL POLICY STATEMENT</H4></CENTER>
     The organization known as Patients Out of Time is a nonprofit licensee of the Commonwealth of Virginia that shall lobby and educate all disciplines of health care professionals; their specialty and professional organizations; and the public at large about medical cannabis (marijuana).<P>
     Prior to the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, marijuana was widely used by medical doctors in the United States for a variety of physical and emotional ailments.  The U.S. government began a litany of "reefer madness" propaganda and police actions that are with us today.  Coupled with the bureaucratic demands of the tax act, the practice of physicians prescribing cannabis for therapeutic purposes in such an environment became subject to great scrutiny and therefore unwise.  Cannabis' therapeutic value was no longer taught in medical schools, it vanished from the pharmacopeia of the U.S., it became outlawed.<P>
     Patients Out of Time shall focus it's power to reinstitute cannabis as a legitimate medicine for use within the United States.  Thirty-six states have recognized the therapeutic potential of cannabis and have passed legislation supporting it's medical use.  Cannabis, under modern research protocol, has been found to be effective in reducing intraocular pressure in 
glaucoma, reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, stimulating the appetite for persons living with AIDS and suffering from wasting syndrome, controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, reduction in the intensity of chronic pain, and controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders.<P>
     Patients Out of Time has no other interest, nor does the organization have any opinion, stated or unstated, about any issue other than therapeutic cannabis.  All lobbying, educating, communication, or any other endeavor of Patients Out of Time shall be limited to the sole subject - Marijuana as Medicine!<P><P>
