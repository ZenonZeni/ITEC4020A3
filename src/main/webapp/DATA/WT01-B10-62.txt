<b>Objectives: </b>To summarize the outcome of ART procedures at the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Centre for Advanced Reproductive Technology at Georgia Baptist Medical Center and Paces Cryobankand Infertility Services and compare these results to SARTdatabase (Society of Assited Reproductive Technology). <p>

<b>Design: </b>Data were collected from all the procedures performed (5/92-12/94). Comparisons of ART data was performed between SART data collected from the annual (1992, the latest report available) summary report. <p>

<b>Main Outcome Measures:</b> The outcomes include the results of all ART procedures. A comparison of these outcomes was performed between IVF procedures only, due to the higher number of these procedures.  <p>

<b>Results: </b>The Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre  program initiated 100 cycles (as of 12/31/94) of ART treatment, including FET and donor oocyte. Of these, 2 cycles initiated (1-canceled) were IVF-natural cycles, no pregnancy achieved; 77 cycles initiated (13 - canceled) were IVFstimulated cycles, with 30.6% deliveries per retrieval (SART=16.8%); 5 cycles initiated (2 canceled) of GIFT with 33.3% deliveries per retrieval, 16 cycles initiated (4 canceled) were FET, No pregnancy achieved. In 31.2% or our cases, the women were greater than or  equal to 40 years old (SART=12.6%). Male factor was present in 64% of the cases (SART=23.5%). <p>

<b>Conclusions: </b>The patient age and percentage of male factors were significantly higher at Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre  then those reported by SART. However, the outcome as reported by deliveries or pregnancies per retrieval or transfer were significantly higher than those reported by SART. As reported by SART only 8.7% of the ART programs reported success rate of >30% deliveries per retrieval. This indicates that the success rate of this ART program  is equivalent to the results of the top 10% ART programs in the nation.<hr>
