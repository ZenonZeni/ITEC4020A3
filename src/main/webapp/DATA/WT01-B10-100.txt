From small beginnings great things happen.  Larisa Kochorva and Anne Atkinson had a dream that Russian women would have access to the same quality of women’s healthcare as American women. They shared that vision with Dr.Perloe, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Georgia Baptist Medical Center, during a Norplant conference in July of 1992 in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Perloe met with Russians specialists in gynecology, urology and general surgery in an effort to assess their needs, desires and capabilities.<p>  
Dr. Michael Herndon, director of comparative medicineat Georgia Baptist Medical Center, joined the team to help plan a multiyear strategy.  Initially, our efforts would focus on the introduction of the latest endoscopic surgical techniques.  To meet our goals required an assessment of their healthcare infrastructure and resources, as well as a comprehensive medical education program and supply effort.<p>  
The American and Russian partners jointly developed a program that included lectures, laboratory sessions as well as surgical training.  One of our goals was to introduce these new surgical concepts to the largest possible audience. Intensive training would be reserved for a smaller group.  By limiting the endoscopic training to a smaller group, we were able to insure that the Russian physicians could safely continue developing their skills after the two week program was completed. <p>
The first symposium involved eleven American participants and 250 Russian participants.  $200,000 of equipment and supplies were provided.  During the two week exchange,  separate lecture programs were held in gynecology, urology and general surgery.  Laboratory training sessions covered equipment operation, endoscopic suturing, hysteroscopy, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and pelvic lymph node dissection.  Russian physicians performed twenty-two operations with their American partners.  Meetings were held late into St. Petersburg’s “White Nights” to plan the June 94 symposium which would provide greater focus on women’s healthcare. Expanded sessions were planned to address menopause, hysterosocpy, endoscopy, endometriosis, ultrasonography, contraception, highrisk obstetrics and perioperative nursing issues.<p>
The Second International Women’s Health and Endoscopy Symposium took over a year to coordinate.  This was greatly facilitated by the signing of the A.I.H.A. partnership agreement between Georgia Baptist Medical Center and  First Medical Institute-Pavlov as well as the personal support of David Harrell, CEO of Georgia Baptist Medical Center.  Our partnership enabled Russian specialists to actively participate in the planning and implementation of our project.<p>
Our second symposium involved 17 American participants, hundreds of Russian participants, and over $250,000 of donated supplies, time and shipping costs.  Although the general format for this years’ symposium was similar to last year, lectures, laboratories and surgical procedures, there were some notable differences.  This years’ symposium included case presentations by Russian physicians as well as lectures highlighting specific areas of expertise.  These presentations pointed out many differing beliefs and resulted in a lively exchange of views.<p>
In America, the current therapy for  endometriosis relies on surgery and hormonal manipulation.  American gynecologists are just now beginning to explore the immunologic basis for this disease.  Our Russian colleagues have vast experience using immunotherapy for endometriosis and frequently rely on immunotherapy as first line treatment.<p>    
Management of the menopause is another area where differences were noted.  Many Russian physicians expressed the belief that the debility associated with estrogen deprivation, menopause, is natural and should be endured, not treated.  When a woman’s symptoms are severe enough, galvanic treatments and antipsychotic drugs may be employed.  Other Russian physicians share the view of their American counterparts that while estrogen deprivation is part of the natural aging process,  its sequalae are not.  These women should be treated with estrogen replacement therapy.  <p>
A major goal of this years’ effort was to provide slides and handouts in Russian.  Our contraceptive slide presentations were entirely in Russian and an extensive Russian handout was made available.  On the topic of contraceptive beliefs, our views also differed widely.  Despite the fact that birth control pills are held to be safe and effective by American physicians, Russian physicians are leery of hormonal contraception.  It is noteworthy that while one Russian physician presented exciting research that has led to improved hormonal contraceptive options, many Russian physicians and the population at large ignore this contraceptive option. <p>
In order to better understand the status of women’s healthcare in Russia, we held focus groups and discussed issues in family planning and menopause.  A session was held with Russian women physicians to assess their views.  <p>
The nursing program was especially well received.   Issues of patient care, sterilization, centralization of OR facilities and resources was addressed.  The Russian nurses were enthusiastic about the potential development of an expanded role and looked forward to future efforts to revise and expand the Russian nursing curricula.<p>
Throughout the symposium, discussions were held with the university president, Nikolai Yaitsky and Larisa Kochorova, director of Delor, on how to improve efficiency and thereby achieve the maximum utilization of resources.  As a direct result of these discussions, a new position has been created at the university to coordinate endoscopy equipment, training and supplies.  The university has committed to develop a centralized endosurgery facility thereby enabling all physicians access to this technology.<p>
Over the past few years, we have worked closely developing relationships with our colleagues.  We stayed with their families, communicated openly and immersed ourselves in the Russian culture.  We strongly believe  that our successes would not have been possible without the level of trust which has developed over the past three years.  Our personal goals are: to hold a third symposium on endoscopy and women’s health;  to provide further assistance in the centralization of endoscopy services; to foster an ongoing exchange of physicians, nurses and information;  and to establish an economically sustainable women’s health clinic.  We look forward to sharing our experience and resources with other A.I.H.A. programs with similar interests. <p><hr>
