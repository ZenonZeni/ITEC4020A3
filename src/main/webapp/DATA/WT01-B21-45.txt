<p> TI - Treatment of human spasticity with delta
9-tetrahydrocannabinol. </p>

<p> AB - Spasticity is a common neurologic condition in patients
with multiple sclerosis, stroke, cerebral palsy or an injured
spinal cord. Animal studies suggest that THC has an inhibitory
effect on polysynaptic reflexes. Some spastic patients claim
improvement after inhaling cannabis. We tested muscle tone,
reflexes, strength and performed EMGs before and after
double-blinded oral administration of either 10 or 5 mg THC or
placebo. The blinded examiner correctly identified the trials in
which the patients received THC in seven of nine cases. For the
group, 10 mg THC significantly reduced spasticity by clinical
measurement (P less than 0.01). Quadriceps EMG interference
pattern was reduced in those four patients with primarily
extensor spasticity. THC was administered to eight other patients
with spasticity and other CNS lesions. Responses varied, but
benefit was seen in three of three patients with &quot;tonic
spasms.&quot; No benefit was noted in patients with cerebellar
disease. </p>

<p> TI - Delta-9-THC in the treatment of spasticity associated
with multiple sclerosis. </p>

<p> AB - Marijuana is reported to decrease spasticity in patients
with multiple sclerosis. This is a double blind, placebo
controlled, crossover clinical trial of delta-9-THC in 13
subjects with clinical multiple sclerosis and spasticity.
Subjects received escalating doses of THC in the range of 2.5-15
mg., five days of THC and five days of placebo in randomized
order, divided by a two-day washout period. </p>

<p> Subjective ratings of spasticity and side effects were
completed and semiquantitative neurological examinations were
performed. At doses greater than 7.5 mg there was significant
improvement in patient ratings of spasticity compared to placebo.
These positive findings in a treatment failure population suggest
a role for THC in the treatment of spasticity in multiple
sclerosis. </p>
