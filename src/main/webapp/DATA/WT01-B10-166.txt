<h2>Primecare Coverage</h2>



<h3>Specialist Consultation Cover</h3>

Diagnostic tests and consultations can be very expensive if your policy only pays for those which are linked to a hospital stay, or imposes financial limits. Primecare provides full cover for out-patient consultations and tests whether or not they are linked to in-patient care.



<H3>Provision for Alternative Medicine</H3>

These days alternative medicine is widely acknowledged to be a proven, effective way of treating a range of conditions. Unlike some other private medical plans, Primecare includes specific benefits for acupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathy and homoeopathy fees up to &#163;1000 per year.



<H3>Guaranteed Acceptance</H3>

Our aim is to smooth the way for you from the start. So we guarantee you will be accepted as a Prime Health customer if you are under the age of 75 and resident in the UK. And you won't even have to take a medical.

<p>

Basically, we apply a straightforward initial exclusion to any pre-existing medical condition for which you have received treatment, had symptoms of, sought advice on or were aware existed during the 5 years before commencement of your Plan. Any such pre-existing medical condition may become eligible for cover. Provided that you remain free of any treatment, advice, medication or check-ups for that condition or any related condition for a continuous period of two years following the start of the policy.



<H3>Is There Anything We Don't Cover?</H3>

Like all other insurers, there are certain things Primecare will not cover. For example: chronic long-term illness, wilful self-inflicted injuries, AIDS, normal pregnancy, cosmetic treatment, regular renal dialysis, routine examinations and GP and dental visits. Full exclusion details appear in the policy document.
