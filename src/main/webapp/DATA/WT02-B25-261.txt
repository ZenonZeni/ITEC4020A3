<H2>HOMELESS AND MISSING SERVICE</H2>

<hr>
People who are mentally ill cannot always communicate their thoughts
clearly or understand what others are saying to them.  In confusion,
some will retreat.  Others have grandiose ideas and cannot make
sound judgments.  Sometimes they leave home or other secure surroundings,
and they become homeless or missing.  They can be gone for days,
weeks, months, or years.  Often they leave behind distraught families
who are desperate to return their loved ones home or to a safe
place.
<P>
What is the Homeless and Missing Service for Persons with Mental
Illness?
<P>
The Homeless and Missing Service for Persons with Mental Illness
is a program of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI),
a national, grassroots, self-help advocacy organization for families
and friends of those suffering from severe mental illnesses and
those persons themselves.  The purpose of the service is to try
to locate persons with mental illnesses who are reported missing
by families, loved ones, or friends.  It was created to provide
assistance and support to families and people who are mentally
ill and missing or homeless and to reunite them when possible.
<P>
How do I report a missing person with mental illness?
<P>
The Homeless and Missing Service operates an emergency hotline
to assist all families and friends who have a missing relative
or friend.  The number is 912-328-3555 (fax number is the same),
and it is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
<P>
When you contact the Homeless and Missing Service, you will be
asked to complete and have notarized an application and send it
with a clear photograph of the missing person to the national
chairman or to a state coordinator.  The national office keeps
a complete file of all missing persons' cases, and all files are
confidential.
<P>
What does the service do once it receives my application and photo?
<P>
When the service receives a request for assistance, it verifies
the name, address, and telephone number of the person making the
request and verifies the name, sex, and general description of
the missing person.  It then determines where the person disappeared
from and for how long he or she has been missing.  Both the national
and state offices work with this information.
<P>
You will be asked to send copies of guardianship papers, court
orders, or doctors' letters (if you have them) attesting to the
mental and physical condition of your missing loved one.  The
service will ask for your permission to obtain information about
your loved one, prepare and distribute missing person flyers,
and provide information for radio and television broadcast.  The
national or state office will keep you informed about its progress.
<P>
The service does not just work for the families and friends of
the missing person.  In most cases, it is also working directly
with and for a missing person with a mental illness.  The service
is concerned with the missing person's interests and welfare,
including his or her individual rights.  Most missing or homeless
persons who are mentally ill are unable to help themselves and
need the service's assistance.
<P>
What is it the service cannot do?
<P>
The service works to help you locate a missing person with mental
illness; however, it does not have the responsibility of returning
that person home or referring him or her to a hospital for observation
or treatment.  When your loved one is located--and when he or
she does not object--the service will immediately notify you of
his or her location and general physical and mental condition.
 If the person is 21 years old or older and objects to your being
informed of his or her location, the service cannot tell you where
he or she is--but it will tell you about the person's general
condition.  If, however, your loved one is a danger to him- or
herself or to others, the service will
<P>
--notify you immediately of the person's location and condition;
<P>
--notify the local law enforcement office, police, or sheriff
in the county where the person is; and
<P>
--notify the mental health state agency in the county where the
person is.
<P>
The service does not have the authority to commit a person to
a medical facility or decide any legal transaction, but it will
give you advice and assistance when possible.
<P>
Is there a charge for the services of the Missing and Homeless
Service?
<P>
This NAMI program does not charge anything for its services because
those working the cases are families and friends of individuals
who are mentally ill and homeless and missing.  The service does
not solicit donations, but it accepts them to help with expenses.
 All donations are tax-deductible.
<P>
How can I find out more about NAMI?
<P>

the NAMI Helpline at 1-800/950-NAMI.
