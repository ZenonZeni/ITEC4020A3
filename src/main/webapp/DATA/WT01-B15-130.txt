<h2>REMARKS BY DANIEL A. DREYFUS, DIRECTOR</h2><br>
<h3>OFFICE OF CIVILIAN RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT<br>
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</h3><br>
<h5>AT THE<br>
<b>UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</b><br>
OCTOBER 10, 1995</h5>
<p>

<body><b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee.  I am Daniel A. Dreyfus,
Director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management.  At your request, I am pleased to address today the "Integrated Spent Nuclear
Fuel Management Act" (H.R. 1020).
<p>
The Administration has not yet developed a formal position on H.R. 1020.  My testimony will
be limited, therefore, to the history and status of the existing program and the practical
considerations of the proposed legislation.
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The U.S. has an inventory of spent nuclear fuel produced by some 118 operating and
shutdown nuclear reactors in 34 states.  Existing storage facilities at commercial utility reactor
sites are reaching their full capacities.  Today, seven utilities are providing additional dry
storage for some 600 metric tons of uranium (MTU).  By 2010, the earliest time in which we
could expect to begin to emplace waste in a geologic repository, the figures will rise to 55
utility reactor sites in 30 states needing dry storage for about 11,000 MTU.
<p>
Without a centralized storage or disposal facility, extended at-reactor storage for many decades
could become necessary.  This is a scenario that was never envisioned by the communities
near existing nuclear power plants, the state public utility commissions that authorized
investments in those power plants, the utilities who constructed them, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission that licensed them, or the Congress, which established Federal responsibility for
accepting the waste.  Consequently, as reactor sites require more storage on-site, technical
constraints or local opposition could threaten the ability of some utilities to continue the
operation of otherwise efficient and economic generating units.  It is worth noting, however,
that the Commission has determined that extended storage at existing commercial reactor sites,
if properly undertaken in accordance with Commission requirements, does not threaten public
health and safety.
<p>
Without a storage or disposal facility, there will be no path forward for the high-level
radioactive waste resulting from the clean-up of many of our nuclear weapons production sites,
the receipt of foreign research reactor spent fuel of U.S. origin, and other high-level
radioactive wastes owned by the federal government.
<p>
<b>The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</b>
<p>
In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), confirming the Federal
responsibility to manage the disposal of commercial spent fuel and adopting the strategy of
geologic disposal as the long-term solution.  Later, in 1985, the President determined that
defense-related high-level wastes would also be disposed of in a geologic repository. 
Additional materials for disposal include spent nuclear fuel of U.S. origin from foreign
research reactors and spent nuclear fuel owned by our government, including spent fuel from
nuclear powered naval vessels.
<p>
The NWPA included provisions to finance the nuclear waste program through a fee on
consumers of nuclear energy.  This financing approach preserves intergenerational equity by
providing resources for the management of nuclear waste in a manner that does not impose
undue burdens and risks on future generations.
<p>
The commercial or civilian portion of the program is funded through appropriations from the
Nuclear Waste Fund, which is collected from  the ratepayers of nuclear-generated electricity. 
Contributions to the fund are approximately $600 million per year.  To date, the fund has
received over $8 billion (including interest) and the program has spent about $4 billion.  About
$1.7 billion of this amount has financed the on-going site suitability evaluation of the Yucca
Mountain candidate repository site in Nevada.  The portion of the programs cost estimated to
be
associated with the disposal of defense-related waste is covered by other appropriations of
general funds.
<p>
In 1987, the Congress amended the NWPA.  Among its other provisions, the amendment
directed the Department to limit the repository program to the evaluation of the Yucca
Mountain sites suitability for geologic disposal.  The amendment restricted the Departments
authority to site and develop an interim storage facility.
<p>
With regard to the status of our activities at the Yucca Mountain site, our 25-foot-diameter,
720-ton tunnel boring machine (TBM) was delivered, assembled, and tested for start-up on
September 19, 1994.  As of October 2, 1995, our TBM was 6,569 feet into Yucca Mountain,
more than 2,350 feet ahead of schedule.  We have completed more than one-fifth of the tunnel
that we proposed in our program plan.  Our progress into the mountain has permitted our
scientists to begin direct observation and testing of the sites geologic features.  Three
underground test alcoves have been completed with another one currently under construction. 
With appropriations that meet planned funding levels, the current program approach calls for
the completion in 1997 of the remaining portions of the tunnel and associated test alcoves and
drifts.
<p>
In our surface-based testing program, we have also met all of our goals for fiscal year 1995. 
We have implemented a systematic drilling program that is providing us with data to create a
3-dimensional geophysical model of the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
Our Program Plan, which assumes the budgeted fiscal year 1996 appropriation of $630 million, includes a
target date for a Departmental conclusion about the technical suitability of the Yucca Mountain
site in 1998.  This will accommodate a target date for a license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in 2001, receipt of a construction authorization from the Commission
in 2004, and the initial emplacement of spent nuclear fuel in 2010.
<p>
There is no current authority under the NWPA to initiate action on interim storage at a specific
site.  Our program, however, includes a set of activities that are relevant to the acceptance of
spent fuel.  They include on-going relations with the utilities and other federal organizations,
preliminary planning for the nationwide transportation system that will be required, and the
development of the next generation of transportation and storage technology, the multi-purpose
canister system.
<p>
<b>Summary of H.R. 1020 Provisions</b>
<p>
H.R. 1020 directs the Departments Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program to
expedite the development of an interim storage facility near the Yucca Mountain site to
facilitate the Departments acceptance of commercial spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  It directs the
Department to continue site characterization for a permanent repository, and designates the
construction of a rail spur from the mainline rail line at Caliente, Nevada, to the interim
storage facility site.  It also specifically eliminates funding for the multipurpose canister
system.
<p>
H.R. 1020 does not require the Department to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for
the interim storage facility.  The bill does, however, direct the Department to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement for construction and operation of the rail spur.  It also directs
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to
accompany its licensing action associated with the interim storage facility.  It authorizes
acceptance of defense waste, foreign research reactor spent fuel, and spent fuel from shut-down reactors when the acceptance rate pursuant to the existing disposal contracts between the
Department and the utilities has been achieved.
<p>
With regard to program funding, the bill states that annual fees shall match the annual level of
appropriations less prior year carryover and defense appropriations, and that waste fees
received after its enactment go directly to the Treasury rather than the Nuclear Waste Fund.
<p>
<b>Federal Land Withdrawal</b>
<p>
<b>Land Withdrawal Within the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</b>
<p>
The NWPA, as amended, does not address the withdrawal of federal land.  There has been no
land withdrawal for the scientific and technical investigation of the Yucca Mountain site. 
Administrative land withdrawal, as provided for under the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act, has a maximum 40-year withdrawal period; therefore the construction of a
geologic
repository at the Yucca Mountain site would require legislative action for the permanent withdrawal of land
for this purpose.
<p>
The Yucca Mountain site comprises a mix of federal lands under the jurisdiction of the
Department of the Interior.  Some of these lands have already been withdrawn for use by other
federal agencies, including the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Energy.  The ongoing
characterization of the Yucca Mountain site is taking place through agreements with these
agencies.
<p>
Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  The Department has a right-of-way reservation (N-47748) from the BLM that includes lands west of the Nevada Test Site and south of the Nellis
Air Force Range.  The Department has assigned this reservation to its Nevada Operations
Office.  The reservation will expire in 2001.
<p>
In September of 1990, the BLM withdrew mineral rights within the area of Right of Way
Reservation N-47748 from operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws.  This action was
taken to prevent mining claims from being staked over the repository block and does not
provide any additional land use rights.
<p>
U.S. Air Force.  The Nellis Range was withdrawn for the Air Force by the Military Land
Withdrawal Act of 1986.  This withdrawal expires in 2001.  The Department has a right-of-way reservation (N-48602) for a portion of the Nellis Range, located north of the land
reserved under N-47748 and west of the test site.  This reservation has also been assigned to
the Departments Nevada Operations Office.  It too will expire in 2001; however,  the Air
Force has already started the process to renew it.
<p>
The Department of Energy.    The BLM withdrew land from the public domain for the
Departments Nevada Test Site in four parcels beginning in 1952.  The Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Office has established a Memorandum of Agreement with the Departments
Nevada Operations Office for use of the western part of Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site.
<p>
<b>Land Withdrawal Under H.R. 1020</b>
<p>
The land withdrawals proposed in H.R. 1020 generally follow the provisions of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act.  They are, however, not subject to its limitations and
restrictions.
<p>
Section 201 of H.R. 1020 addresses land withdrawal and the acquisition of rights-of-way for
the railroad spur and the intermodal transfer facility.  It directs the Secretary to acquire rights-of-way and withdraw public lands as necessary within the Caliente route for the construction
and operation of transportation facilities and associated activities.  It also directs the Secretary
to provide for the replacement of land and city wastewater disposal activities necessary to
commence intermodal transfer activities no later than January 31, 1998.  Section 206 addresses
land withdrawal for the repository and interim storage facility.
<p>
Sections 201 and 206 direct the Secretary to publish, within six months of the bills enactment, 
Federal Register Notices containing legal descriptions of the Caliente route, the sites and
rights-of-way to be acquired for the intermodal transfer facility, and the land to be withdrawn
for the interim storage facility.  With regard to the geologic repository, Section 206 further
requires the Secretary to publish, concurrent with the application to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for authority to construct a repository, a Federal Register Notice containing a
legal description of the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
Sections 201 and 206 also direct the Secretary to file copies of the aforementioned legal
descriptions and maps depicting transportation routes, sites and rights-of-way to be acquired,
and lands to be withdrawn with all or some of the following groups:  the Congress, the
Secretary of the Interior, the Archivist of the United States, the Governor of Nevada, the
Board of Lincoln County Commissioners, the Board of Nye County Commissioners, and the
Caliente City Council.
<p>
<b>Concluding Remarks</b>
<p>
The program would need to seek Congressional land withdrawal authority for the geologic
repository site and the necessary transportation access routes sometime in the future, should
the site be found suitable for repository development.  In view of the complexities of the
Federal land ownership patterns in and around the Yucca Mountain site, if additional authority
for the program is enacted to provide for interim storage, a related rail access spur, and an
intermodal transfer facility, that legislation should also provide for the necessary withdrawal of
public land.  Failure to provide these lands could lead to protracted delays in realizing the
intent of the legislation.
<p>
In closing, again, I would note that my remarks should not be construed as an official
endorsement of the overall legislation.  The Administration has not taken a position on H.R.
1020 at this time.</body>
