POLAND'S BANK CONSOLIDATION PROGRAMME CRITICISED BY S&P

BANK RATING agency Standard & Poor's has criticised Poland's bank
consolidation programme, saying it will not affect the creditworthiness
of the banks.

The Polish government has changed its bank strategy in the past year to
accelerate the privatisation of the remaining banks. Rather than
selling them off as it has done with four of the nine banks to date, it
now plans to merge the banks into two of the leading specialised banks -
 Polska Kasa Opieki (Pekao) and Bank Handlowy w Warsawie.

Under the plan, Bank Handlowy w Warsawie will absorb Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy (PBKS) and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH), while Pekao will
merge with Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy and
Polski Bank Rozwoju (PBR).

According to Standard & Poor's, "the consolidation would not
significantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,
or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range for
zloty-denominated obligations".

It added that certain risks would increase in the near term, as the
mergers would bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio, and
the integration process could be difficult. S&P said that objections
from shareholders of the already semi- privatised banks BPH and PBR, as
well as from regional bank managements "could still scuttle the deal".

Recent reports from Poland said the president of BPH claimed she would
fight the merger with Bank Handlowy w Warsawie if it meant BPH would
lose its separate identity. And the president of Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy is reported to have said that a takeover of PBKS and BPH
would cause chaos and delay the privatisation process.

S&P said that"a more jaundiced view" held by some market players is
that the consolidation strategy is merely a ploy by the government for
reasserting control over the banking system, a theory which will be
borne out, it said, if Bank Handlowy w Warsawie and Pekao are not
privatised.

On the plus side, S&P said the consolidation plan could give the two
banks greater diversity and market share, which could be positive
factors. Bank Handlowy w Warsawie would gain more retail deposits and
commercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution network
and possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertise
of Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokerage
strength.

CZECH REPUBLIC:  CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCES PLAN TO EASE BANK CRISIS

THE CZECH National Bank (CNB) has announced a consolidation programme
for small Czech banks to improve confidence in the sector, following
the near-collapse of a fourth bank in January. The programme affects
about 8 percent of the banking sector and will require small banks to
recapitalise and reduce their bad debt exposures by the end of 1996.

Ekoagrobanka, a small agricultural bank based in Usti nad Labem, north
Bohemia, was forced into administration by the CNB's Banking
Supervision Committee in mid-January and remained closed for more than
a week after rumours flared that it was having difficulties, creating
queues outside its 79 branches.

The CNB advanced the bank CK1 billion ($37.4 million) to help cover the
rush on its demand deposits, and the CNB issued a statement in support
of Ekoagrobanka and its likely recovery. Shareholders agreed
reluctantly to a capital reduction by nearly CK600 million to only
CK1.2 million plus the injection of CK500 million of fresh capital from
Konsolidacni Banka, which becomes the largest shareholder.

The CNB stated that Ekoagrobanka depositors should face no limits on
their withdrawals once the bank opens again for business. Although
depositors are insured for 80 percent of deposits up to CK130,000 under
a new national scheme, many are nervous following the collapse of three
other Czech banks in the past two years - Kreditni a Prumyslova Banka,
AB Banka and Ceska Banka.

The CNB had Ekoagrobanka under close scrutiny due to its large level of
overdue loans, but CNB spokesman Martin Svehla said unlike the three
banks which collapsed, Ekoagrobanka had a realistic plan for
strengthening its capital adequacy and was implementing that plan
within the agreed time.

The 1994 annual accounts of Ekoagrobanka received a heavily qualified
audit from local firm BDO. The auditors noted that reserves for
doubtful debts of CK266 million should, in fact, be CK1,291 million and
provisions against losses on securities should be raised from CK25
million to CK494 million. Total assets in the qualified accounts
amounted to CK12,005 million.

Short-term deposits amounted to 66 percent. The stated profit was CK63
million on CK1,286 million of revenue. The bank had planned to double
its share capital by issuing CK600 million of shares on the Prague
Stock Exchange, but there were few interested buyers.

The National Bank of Slovakia followed the example of their Czech
counterparts and placed the ten Slovak branches of Ekoagrobanka in
forced administration in mid-January.

The CNB has not revealed the names of the banks which it has forced
into its new consolidation scheme, partly for fear of creating further
pressures at a sensitive time. But it is known that many small Czech
banks are struggling from high levels of bad and doubtful debts and low
margins compared to the larger banks.

Banking analysts consider the Czech Republic to be over-banked,
especially with many smaller banks failing to offer a differentiated
service and thus suffering from a lack of access to low-interest loans
and poor quality borrowers.

CZECH REPUBLIC:  CREDITANSTALT TO SELL FUND MANAGEMENT BUSINESS

AUSTRIAN BANK Creditanstalt has agreed to sell its Czech fund
management business Creditanstalt Investment Company to Czech bank
Agrobanka.

The Creditanstalt Investment Company (CAIC), which was established to
participate in the Czech Republic's privatisation programme, manages
the investment portfolios of two coupon privatisation funds,
Creditanstalt Czech Investment Fund (CCIF) and the Creditanstalt Czech
Infrastructure and Utilities Investment Fund (CCIUIF).

Creditanstalt owns 80 percent of CAIC with the rest held by local
investors who are also selling their stake. The sale should be
finalised in the next three months, according to Creditanstalt.
However, the Austrian bank will retain the money market, share funds
and pension funds business of CAIC which will be managed by
Creditanstalt Securities in Prague.

CCIF is listed on the London Stock Exchange where foreign investors
hold over 10 percent of the fund. Agrobanka has offered to buy over
these shares. When complete, Agrobanka will then own all of the shares
of the fund manager and will control the management and investments of
CCIF and CCIUIF.

Agrobanka is the fifth largest bank in the Czech Republic with 350
offices and a sizeable funds management business. Despite the sale,
Creditanstalt still maintains a considerable presence in the Czech
Republic where it has eight offices and a share in Komercni Banka.

RUSSIA REVOKED OVER 300 BANK LICENCES IN 1995

RUSSIA'S CENTRAL Bank revoked the licences of 315 banks in 1995. This
represents over 12 percent of the total number of banks operating in
the country last year.

More than 80 percent of the 2,500 commercial banks examined by the
Central Bank had also broken the law during the year. The Central Bank
also restricted the operations of 423 banks and introduced temporary
management at five banks.

The majority of suspensions happened in August when a liquidity crisis
hit the Russian banking system, crippled the domestic credit market and
brought the system to a standstill. Many banks were unable to meet
obligations on the interbank market (see EEB56). The crisis left few
banks untouched with many smaller banks in particular being badly hit.

The crisis led to a shift in the balance of forces that has affected
even top banks. It led to a serious shake-up in the banking system with
many of the top banks forging close alliances with each other.

Many of the top ten banks reacted to the crippling demise of the
interbank market by forming their own alliance, offering to resume
lending to each other in return for mutual access to financial records.

In response to the crisis, the Central Bank is planning to introduce in
March new laws which will determine how banks will be run and funded.
It has also set up a programme to identify troubled banks.

CZECH AND RUSSIAN BANKS IN JOINT VENTURE

INVESTICNI A Postivni Banka (IPB), the third largest Czech bank, has
entered into a joint venture to establish an investment bank in Russia.
The First Czech-Russian Bank was established in Moscow in a deal
between IPB and local firm Vozrozdenije Bank. IPB will hold a majority
of the $6 million of initial capital.

IPB officials said they had considered buying an established operation,
but settled instead for a joint venture with a local bank which had
complementary operations. The new bank is IPB's first joint venture
outside of the Czech Republic.

UNISYS LOSES A SECOND CONTRACT IN PRAGUE

WESTERN COMPUTER heavyweight Unisys is licking its wounds in the Czech
Republic after losing a major defence contract as its rivals raked over
the embers of its failed contract with savings bank Ceska Sporitelna.

In December Unisys won a tender to supply the Czech Army with an
integrated computer system as the country prepares for entry to NATO.
But the announcement created such a furore among competing firms that
the authorities cancelled the deal a week later.

Although the main reason was said to be the lack of compatibility of
the Unisys system with NATO systems, the army also appeared surprised
to hear about Ceska Sporitelna's experience with the computer firm.

Unisys sealed its first contract with Sporitelna in 1992 to automate
the bank's back office functions, including bookkeeping and inter-bank
transfers, and later to develop a fully integrated banking system
throughout 650 branches. But the projects were dogged by delays,
constantly changing requirements and ongoing disputes.

Sporitelna claims Unisys was using the Czech Republic as a retirement
home for low-quality staff. Unisys claims Sporitelna lacked consistent
policies and made unreasonable demands outside the terms of its
contracts. Either way, in 1995 the bank cancelled the deals and took
over training and project management, leaving Unisys with a hardware
service contract. Both claim they are owed millions of crowns by the
other.

Whatever the truth of the matter, the issue has given Unisys rivals a
major competitive weapon and left the firm scrambling to convince
locals of its capabilities.

CZECHS SIGN AGREEMENT WITH KUWAIT

THE CZECH Republic signed an investment treaty with Kuwait in early
January and is poised for a substantial boost to its search for $100
million of debt to help finance a transnational railway reconstruction
linking Poland and Austria through the Czech Republic.

Czech prime minister Vaclav Klaus toured Kuwait with 25 bankers and
businessmen as part of a general diplomatic and trade mission
throughout the Gulf. The new Czech-Kuwaiti investment treaty aims to
protect investment in the respective countries.

Elsewhere, Czech banks are preparing for an increase in business with
the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Croatia, now that a peace pact
appears likely to hold. The Czech Export Bank (CEB) and the Export
Guarantee and Insurance Company (EGAP) are both working on funding to
help support merchants and others targeting the battle-scarred zone.

Czech and Slovak businesses once had strong ties to the region, and
many expect to renew them now that the embargo on Serbia has been
lifted. Some firms are also keen to capitalise on the extensive
reconstruction and infrastructural work which will be required, with
the CEB and the EGAP hoping to help with finance and insurance.

HUNGARY SEEKS TO DELAY CROSS-BORDER BANKING

HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES want a two-year postponement of an OECD
membership requirement allowing foreign banks to open branches in the
country, according to the finance ministry.

Hungary is expected to join the OECD later this year but wants the two
year grace period to overhaul its banking sector and prepare for cross-
border banking. Hungary has already spent nearly $3 billion
restructuring and privatising banks and helping them deal with bad
loans.

RUSSIA'S MOST-BANK OPENS IN AZERBAIJAN

RUSSIA'S MOST-BANK opened a branch in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan,
at the end of December. It is the first major foreign bank to open a
branch in Azerbaijan following the Azerbaijani parliament's decision
last year to lift the restriction on foreign capital not exceeding 49
percent of the charter capital of any bank in the republic.

Most-Bank Azerbaijan will serve local and Russian exporters and finance
the construction of housing and industrial enterprises in the city. The
new branch is Most-Bank's first foreign subsidiary.

IPARBANKHAZ OF HUNGARY TO CLOSE

IPARBANKHAZ, THE state-controlled Hungarian commercial bank is to close
in February. At an extraordinary general meeting on December 29, the
bank's shareholders decided to cease banking activities by the end of
February as no buyer had been found for the bank. The state controls
over 80 percent of the bank.

EEB reported last month that the troubled commercial bank was to be
closed down after a gradual liquidation reimbursed depositors.

Iparbankhaz stopped accepting new current accounts at the end of last
November and it will cease to handle these accounts from the end of
January. The bank has asked deposit account holders to withdraw their
funds and said it will pay no interest on deposits after January 15.

Banks have been invited to submit offers for the bank's branches, and
offers will be evaluated by the end of January.

BUDAPEST BANK DEAL GOES THROUGH

GE CAPITAL, the banking and insurance arm of the US General Electric
corporation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) purchased a combined 60 percent stake in Budapest Bank in
Hungary in late December.

The transaction has been the first bank privatisation in Hungary in
which the state sold off a majority stake to strategic investors in one
round.

The privatisation allows control of the bank's board and management to
pass from the state to the institutions's new owners. GE Capital will
have operational control of the bank, and will provide the Bank with
new financial products, technology and training.

The deal cost $87 million with GE Capital taking a 27.5 percent stake
and the EBRD acquiring 32.5 percent. In October GE Capital signed a
memorandum of agreement with the Hungarian government to carry out due
diligence of Budapest Bank as a prelude to purchasing a stake in the
bank (see EEB57).

Budapest Bank, Hungary's second bank by capital, with a comparatively
large retail network of over 74 branches, was under pressure to secure
a buyer by the end of 1995 in order to hold on to a controversial state
capital injection made prior to a failed buy-out deal earlier in the
year.

Swiss Bank Credit Suisse pulled out of a purchase deal following its
own due diligence. It is believed to have been mainly dissuaded by key
discrepancies in strategy between the two banks.

Budapest Bank declared a net profit in 1994 of HUF1.6 billion ($12.2
million), mostly due to a capital injection of HUF12 billion secretly
made by the government to shore up losses after the compulsory creation
of a HUF21 billion fund to cover bad loans. It has assets of HUF210
billion and has an image as one of the most innovative banks with
western-style management and product launches.

BANK CRISIS HITS LITHUANIA

THE LITHUANIAN banking system was plunged into crisis in the New Year
sparked by the suspension of the two of the country's commercial banks
at the end of December. The Bank of Lithuania suspended the operations
of the banks and froze their assets, accusing them of insolvency.

The two banks which had been set to merge - Litimpeks and the
Lithuanian Incorporated Innovation Bank (LAIB) - are now at the centre
of an insolvency and fraud investigation.

The reasons for the insolvency of the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation
Bank and Litimpeks banks are being investigated. International audit
company Ernst & Young is performing an audit in these two banks," said
a Bank of Lithuania statement.

The suspensions and investigation have had a serious knock-on effect on
the rest of the banking sector with fears of a run on bank deposits.

On January 9, the government and the Central Bank issued a statement
saying most of the commercial banks were operating normally and
advising people to ignore rumours about the instability of certain
banks. It also urged them not to withdraw deposits from commercial
banks and said that banks were not experiencing difficulties with
payments to customers.

Reports in early January suggested that many Lithuanian commercial
banks had started to run out of hard currency as depositors rushed to
withdraw funds following the suspension of the two banks. Depositors,
fearing a devaluation of the national currency, the litas, queued at
major banks to withdraw hard currency from their accounts.

One report said the demand for US dollars increased tenfold since the
crisis broke, while another said hard currency deposits had dropped by
22 percent and individual deposits by 16 percent. But the government
and the central bank ruled out a devaluation.

However, both the Prime Minister and the President promised state aid
for personal and corporate account holders of the two suspended banks
and said the government will assume liability for their deposits.

The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, passed a law on December 21
bringing in a mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors
against lost bank deposits.

Lithuanian politics were also thrown into chaos by the crisis when the
foreign minister and defence minister resigned in protest against Prime
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius's move to withdraw deposits from his
accounts in the LAIB just days before its operations were suspended.

President Algirdas Brazaukas, however, refused to accept the ministers'
resignations. Slezevicius maintained he did nothing wrong and said he
would stay in office despite some calls for his resignation.

There were also calls for the resignation of Central Bank Governor
Kazys Ratkevicius. His resignation on January 9 was not accepted by the
government which felt it could cause more instability in the banking
sector. Ratkevicius rejected charges that the Central Bank had not
exercised sufficient control over the activities of commercial banks.

On January 12, a joint mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank met with the Prime Minister, the finance minister
and the chairman of the Bank of Lithuania.

Originally, the aim of the mission had been to evaluate the economic
state of the country. But following the crisis, it is now investigating
the reasons behind the problems of the two banks. Together with
officials from the Bank of Lithuania, it will prepare a programme to
overcome the difficulties in the banking system.

LITHUANIAN BANK ISSUES NEW SHARES

VILNIAUS BANKAS, Lithuania's largest private sector bank, recently
completed an international private placement of 34,000 new shares,
raising Lit17 million ($4.25 million) for the bank. The shares were
priced at Lit500 each. The funds raised are aimed at helping the bank
expand its general lending activities.

Vilniaus Bankas, which had total assets of around Lit450 million at the
end of 1995, was established in March 1990 with its head office in the
capital of Lithuania, Vilnius. It has a network of 13 branches,
primarily located in the country's urban, commercial and industrial
centres.

It was the first Lithuanian bank to introduce ATMs and banking cards
and is the sole issuer of Visa cards in Lithuania. Vilniaus Bankas is
twinned with Dutch bank ABN AMRO, which advises it in major operational
areas.

AMENDMENT TO BENEFIT INVESTMENT BANKS

THE CZECH investment market got a shot in the arm in the early New Year
with an amendment to the law on investment funds. The amendment enables
the creation of "managerial funds", which may hold majority stakes in
companies. The law, and related investment activity, is spelling a boom
for local investment banks.

Voucher privatisation funds can now be converted into more aggressive
and predatory managerial funds, but only if they buy out dissenting
privatisation fund shareholders at a price equal to or above net asset
value. That may help to reduce the massive discounts of up to 50
percent at which most privatisation funds are trading.

The amendment, approved by the Czech government in early January, is
partly in response to a sudden rise in mergers and acquisitions in the
market, which CS First Boston head of equity sales Peter Mayer called
"a feeding frenzy".

Recent corporate raids have included a $200 million shopping spree by
Bahamas-based US businessman Michael Dingman, with help from leading
Czech fund manager Viktor Kozeny, targeting a handful of blue chip
companies in late 1995 (see EEB 58). The pair were closely followed by
a flurry of stockmarket deals involving Motoinvest, a private firm
operating through Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, both of which
Motoinvest now controls.

Motoinvest snapped up millions of discounted shares in the
privatisation funds run by the leading Czech banks, and later sold them
back at a substantial profit. Komercni Banka's fund has now swallowed a
poison pill to help prevent a similar raid in future. Motoinvest rose
to fame by buying up heavily discounted small privatisation funds and
selling their assets at a large profit.

In December, Motoinvest bought the Czech privatisation fund management
operations of Creditanstalt, one of the most popular fund managers in
the first wave of voucher privatisation. Other merger and acquisition
activity in December included a deal by leading privatisation fund
manager Ceska Sporitelna to sell 40 percent of its two voucher funds to
Bankers Trust for CK6.7 billion ($252 million) - a discount of more
than 40 percent on their net asset value.

Tomas Fiala, investment funds analyst at Czech stockbroker Wood & Co,
said the level and scope of such financial activity may eventually be
curbed by securities legislation which was proposed alongside the new
investment funds law. The government rejected details of some of the
proposals, including provisions to protect small shareholders by
setting ownership limits beyond which corporate raiders would be forced
to make a takeover bid for an entire company. Fiala said the proposals
have gone back to the drawing board but are likely to be approved by
parliament after the general election in October.

Fiala said the approved changes to the law on investment funds may
improve the impact of the post-communist privatisation process upon
Czech industry, since portfolio investors may now officially take
effective control of their investments for the first time.

Privatisation funds are prohibited from owning 20 percent of any single
company and therefore are forced to work together to achieve managerial
control of companies and effect operational changes. The concept of
active management is not universally accepted and stirred controversy
when some fund managers endeavoured to"tamper" with their investments.

Even so, privatisation investment funds own the bulk of shares in Czech
industry, and the result has been a slow start to economic reform in
the private sector. Some analysts claim the privatisation funds run by
banks, which are among the largest in the country, are especially to
blame for the lack of commercial reform, since many own shares in
companies which are major clients of the banks, and the banks exert
pressure to prevent major changes in their clients' activities.

The new draft law allows the investment fund managers to manage pension
funds for the first time. Its most likely impact is to help fund
managers reduce costs by merging their separate management teams. After
one year of pensions legislation, the major banks and insurance
companies and the leading employers have already established 35 pension
funds. Government authorities expect the total to reach a maximum of 45
before shrinking as market forces dictate rationalisation and mergers.

All funds will also face more stringent reporting requirements.
Penalties for non-compliance are also much stiffer, at a maximum of
CK10 million plus the possibility of suspension, forced administration
and the replacement of management by finance ministry regulators.

GROWTH BUT NO PROFIT FOR PENSION FUNDS

THE NUMBER of Czech pension funds topped 40 by the end of 1995 but few
are yet in profit, according to the Czech Statistical Office.

Total losses in the nine months to the end of September 1995 were CK244
million ($9.17 million), the statistics office revealed recently.
Pension revenues in the first half of 1995 were CK1.02, billion on
which the funds were reported to have lost a total of CK569 million. A
poll in June by the Factum agency found 20 percent of Czechs were
participating in pension funds and a further 21 percent were thinking
about it. A Social Affairs Ministry spokesman said the number of
participants was at the higher end of estimates. The Ministry expects
the total number of funds to reach at least 45 this year, but due to
competition and the lack of immediate profitability, the number is
expected to consolidate.

Some pension schemes have fewer than 5,000 participants, and the figure
of 100,000 participants is exceeded in only three cases: Penzijni Fond
Komercni Banky, Podnikatelsky PF and Vojensky Otvreny Fond. Komercni
Banka's fund has the largest capital base, at CK120 million, followed
by Prumyslovy PF (a subsidiary of Investicni a Postovni Banka) and
Allianz-Hypo.

HUNGARY:  THOMSON BANKWATCH ISSUES BANK RATINGS

US-BASED BANK rating and consulting agency Thomson BankWatch has
assigned intra-country issuer and local currency short-term debt
ratings to a number of banks in Hungary.

The Cental-European International Bank, the Hungarian Foreign Trade
Bank (Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank) and Unicbank are the top-ranked
banks in the country, according to the agency's ratings. Worst
performers are the Commercial and Credit Bank (Kereskedelmi Bank and
the Hungarian Credit Bank (Magyar Hitel Bank).

Last July Thomson BankWatch acquired Bank Research Eastern Europe
(BREE), a bank rating agency specialising in providing research on east
and central European financial institutions. The Hungarian ratings are
the first BREE ratings to be converted to the BankWatch scale. Intra-
country (IC) issuer ratings reflect a combination of pure credit risk
and performance risk, and offer a relative indication of the likelihood
of receiving timely repayment of principal and interest as well as an
opinion regarding the company's vulnerability to negative events that
may alter the market's perception of the bank.

The ratings use a nine-point scale ranging from IC-A for banks with
exceptionally strong fundamentals, representing low-risk, to IC-E for
banks whose viability is in doubt. The nine-point scale is IC-A, IC-
A/B, IC-B, IC-B/C, IC-C, IC-C/C, IC-D, IC-D/E, EC-E.

Short-term debt ratings apply specifically to local currency
obligations. The ratings range from LC-1, indicating a very high
likelihood that interest and principal will be paid on a timely basis,
to LC-4, which is considered speculative. The four-point scale is LC-1,
LC-2, LC-3 and LC-4.

BankWatch uses a rating methodology which involves a thorough analysis
of both financial as well as qualitative factors. Emphasis is placed on
management, market position, ownership, the local environment and
strategic initiatives. Extensive on-site due diligence is conducted on
an annual basis.

"For Hungarian banks, the environment has been extremely challenging
over the last several years. Delayed bad debt work- outs, under-
investment in modern systems and few sophisticated services in an
ineffective regulatory environment have all hampered the restructuring
process in the banking sector," explained Ramin Habibi, president of
Thomson BankWatch-BREE.

As in other eastern European countries, Hungarian state-owned banks
inherited a huge volume of bad loans from the old economic system.
Major reforms were initiated in 1987 with the introduction of a two-
tier system. However, Hungary's massive foreign debt burden held back
the state from cleaning its banks' portfolios as quickly as in
neighbouring countries. Since then, state-owned banks have been
recapitalised along BIS norms, and bad loans have been swapped for long-
term state bonds under the Loan and Consolidation schemes initiated in
1992 and completed at the end of 1994.

"While much improved, asset quality remains an issue," said Habibi.
"The fragmentation of supervisory responsibilities has impeded
effective regulations. Hungary's unique situation has given foreign and
joint-venture bonds an unprecedented opportunity to penetrate the
domestic market. Such intensified competition has fostered a new
rapidly evolving environment, with local management becoming much more
client- oriented and responsive to market needs.

"Overall, much progress has been made to establish a well- functioning
financial system - one that can operate without the support of the
government, but there still is a difficult road ahead."

THE PROSPECTS ARE GOOD

Eastern Europe, though still a drop in the ocean in terms of world
insurance premiums, is a rapidly growing market. In the first part of a
major survey, EEB reports on the state of the industry in countries of
eastern central Europe.

AFTER YEARS of reforms the turnaround in the insurance industry in
eastern Europe appears to have begun. Despite the fact that the world
market share of the region amounts to less than 1 percent and the
insurance industry is still extremely under- developed, the prospects
are good.

Clearly-defined rights of ownership and privatisation of the economy
are of the utmost importance for the insurance industry, according to a
1995 report by Economic Studies Unit of Swiss Reinsurance Company
(Swiss Re). An important indicator for progress in this area, it said,
is the private sector's share in total production which, in most
countries, rose to over 50 percent by the middle of 1994.

But, it added, insurance penetration - the proportion of income spent
on insurance policies - is still quite low throughout the region,
ranging from 3.4 percent in Slovenia to just 0.3 percent in Romania.

In Slovenia, incomes and insurance penetration stand at around half the
EU average, and in the other eastern central European countries at
about one-third. The low penetration could be attributed to the fact
that in the first few years of the changeover to a market economy,
premium income fell in most countries.

The year 1993 appears to have been a watershed for insurers in eastern
Europe. The falling rates of inflation, the economic upturn and the
turnaround to sustained real growth in premium have been having a
positive effect on the insurance industry since 1993. The volume of
premiums in the region increased by an average of 8 percent compared
with the previous year. Worldwide, growth stood at 6 percent. Premium
volume continues to grow at a faster rate than on the world market as a
whole.

The countries of eastern central Europe accounted for 62 percent of
total premium volume in 1993, with Poland the most important single
market. However, in 1994, Russia replaced Poland as eastern and central
Europe's biggest single market. But Swiss Re noted that, apart from in
Poland and Slovenia, it has not yet been possible for eastern European
countries to make up for the sharp downturn in insurance activity which
occurred in the first few years of the transition to a market economy.

Life insurance has shown the highest growth in most countries. However,
it is also exceptionally underdeveloped, accounting for just 25 percent
of premium volume in 1993 against the European Union average of 50
percent. The decline in economic activity resulting from the changeover
to a market economy affected life insurance more than it did non-life
insurance, according to Swiss Re. Only in Poland and Slovenia was there
any increase in the initially very low level of life insurance, it
said.

In 1993, the life insurance sector in eastern central Europe began to
experience strong growth. Provided inflation rates continue to fall and
there are improved investment opportunities on the developing capital
markets and tax incentives for private provision for old age, the life
insurance sector should also see above-average growth in the years
ahead as levels of prosperity rise, according to Swiss Re.

In the non-life sector, motor insurance is expected to dominate. Marine
insurance has also helped to push up growth in non-life business. But
motor insurance is expected to continue to account for 40 percent-50
percent of this sector, in line with traditional developing market
growth patterns, until rising prosperity levels make for more diverse
demand.

General third-party liability insurance is also projected to grow
significantly. Indeed, in contrast to western Europe, it could
initially outstrip personal accident and health cover, a segment
traditionally more than twice as large as liability. Agricultural
insurances, which were very prevalent when reforms began have fallen
off considerably and their importance looks set to decline even
further, especially in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

But reinsurance rather than insurance is likely to grab much of the
limelight until eastern European countries are in a position to raise
minimum capital requirements. These are still being kept precariously
low due to the structural weakness of the insurance sector and the lack
of capital.

Under these conditions, reinsurance is of the utmost importance for
safeguarding solvency, said Swiss Re, both by providing support to new
private companies during the process of growth and by helping with the
restructuring of the former monopoly companies, which often do not have
an adequate capital base.

That leaves reinsurers, especially foreign ones, in a strong position
to tap a regional market which hands over 5 percent more than the
European Union's average of 17 percent of non-life insurance to
reinsurance. Most countries are eager for foreign reinsurers to take on
the secondary insurance market that no local players are willing or
prepared to supply adequately.

The progress of the past five years has also been helped by the reforms
in the regulatory framework of the various countries and the enactment
and enforcement of supervisory laws. Different approaches have been
taken by different countries - Poland's market is highly deregulated
with emphasis on financial control and Hungary has substantive control
for all products.

It should be noted that regulations in various countries are still in a
state of flux with regulations to be passed or laws completed. The
legislators in the countries of eastern central Europe have been
strongly influenced by European Union Directives when drafting
regulatory legislation.

POLAND

Although replaced by Russia as the region's biggest single insurance
market in 1994, Poland's insurance sector continues to grow quickly.
Economic development, a decreasing level of inflation and the
progressive adjustment of legal regulations to EU directives create
good opportunities for the insurance sector, according to corporate
finance and advisory services firm Ernst & Young in Warsaw.

Among the 41 insurance companies licensed to run insurance businesses
in Poland, 13 are conducting life business with the remainder running
non-life business.

In 1993, the Polish market represented 27 percent of the total premium
collected in eastern Europe. In 1994 all insurance companies jointly
collected a gross premium equal to ZL4.15 billion ($1.75 billion) - 33
percent more than in 1993.

In the first half of 1995 the gross premium collected in the life
business increased by 40 percent more in comparison with the first half
of 1994, while the gross premium of the non-life business was 21
percent more.

In 1994, almost 70 percent of premiums were accounted for by general
business with the remainder accounted for by life business.

At the beginning of the 1990s, the development of the life products
market was rather slow due to high inflation, low average real wages
and the marginal size of the middle classes.

The majority of the Polish population had one cheap group life
insurance with a very limited level of protection. However, Poland's
life insurance industry enjoyed dramatic growth in 1993 and 1994. Life
insurance premiums collected in 1994 were approximately 45 percent
higher than in 1993 and amounted to around $0.6 billion.

Taking into account that inflation was at 32 percent in 1994, this
represents a real increase of about 13 percent. In 1994 the main areas
of growth were in group life policies. PZU, the state- owned insurance
company which still dominates the Polish market, collected premiums
amounting to $500 million, although its market share decreased to 95
percent.

In the first half of 1995, PZU's market share reduced further to 90.3
percent, losing out to foreign insurers Commercial Union (5.2 percent),
Amplico (3.9 percent), AGF (0.4 percent) and Nationale-Nederlanden (0.1
percent).

The continuing development of the life insurance market will depend on
the level of economic growth, inflation trends and changes in the
social security system and income tax policy, according to Ernst &
Young. The following factors will determine the development of the life
insurance market in the coming years.

1. Unfavourable personal tax treatment of life products. However, the
regulation introduced this year allowed the companies to consider life
insurance premiums for the first time (paid on behalf of employees) as
company costs. Life insurance premiums will not be tax deductible in
the short and medium term unless an aggressive lobbying campaign is
conducted.

2. Further postponement of the social security reform since 1990. In
April 1995, the Council of Ministries presented the draft of the Social
Security Act with a new pension system (consisting of a state pension,
a social insurance pension and a voluntary pension plan).
Realistically, a programme for social security reform could be prepared
and approved in 1996. This programme will definitely not be "a shock
therapy", but rather a step-by- step approach, explained Ernst & Young.
Regulation concerning close-end funds and pension funds have also been
drafted and will be passed and implemented in 1996. This may start
benefiting the life insurance market by 1997 or 1998.

3. VAT on insurance agents' services was implemented in 1995 and had a
big impact on agents' incomes. Under pressure from the insurance lobby,
tax decreased to 7 percent until the end of 1995. The tax rate for 1996
is still unknown.

4. The monopoly of PZU and state protectionism. In June 1994, the
Ministry of Finance accepted a plan presented by the management of PZU
for its privatisation without turning to the EBRD for a $200 million
loan designated to boost the company's reserves. Under the plan, the
Ministry opted to split the PZU into two separate companies. But
following the change in government at the end of 1995, it was decided
not to split the PZU, but to leave the company intact and privatise it
in 1996 through the sale of shares to employees, individual investors
and carefully selected institutional investors.

5. Low confidence in the financial institutions among the Polish
population. Such an attitude was the result of Polish private banks and
private insurance companies going bankrupt.

Ernst & Young said that the economic growth of 1994 points to the
resilience of the recovery which was initiated in mid-1992. The
economic mechanisms launched a guarantee that the rate of economic
growth will be kept at 4.5 percent in the 1990s and long-term inflation
is showing a gradual downward trend.

The annual inflation rate which was 32 percent in 1994 is expected to
fall to 10 percent in 1999. Therefore, it can be expected that the
development of the life insurance market will accelerate in the coming
years, said Ernst & Young.

Foreign insurers may not open branches in Poland until 1999. However,
they may set up separate companies, in full accordance with Polish law,
and/or enter into joint ventures with Polish partners. Despite local
companies facing technical problems, a lack of qualified personnel and
limited solvency, a number of foreign companies are approaching the
market.

The most popular distribution channel is the own distribution network,
a regional level structure, with branches and sub- branches or
representative offices. The number of independent brokers and agents is
growing, with around 600 brokers now licensed in the country.

According to Ernst & Young, co-operation between different insurance
companies and Polish banks is expected to grow with the increasing
acceptance of the idea of bancassurance and the fact that most of the
foreign companies created joint-ventures with Polish banks when they
entered the Polish market.

A law on insurance activities was passed in July 1990. However, due to
the rapid development of the market, much-needed changes were
implemented with the Insurance Act in October 1995. Ernst & Young said
that these changes had the following objectives:

* Increase the compatibility to EU directives;

* Better protection of the insured by increasing the financial
requirements of companies applying for an insurance licence as well
existing insurers. In particular, the share capital for insurers
entering the market, should equal the minimum guarantee capital
(Ecu800,000 for life business or Ecu200,000-Ecu400,000)

* Increasing and clearly defining the power of insurance supervision
which will control insurers, brokers and agents. An independent Office
of Insurance Supervision (OIS) will be established. At present,
insurance supervision is part of the Ministry of Finance.

* Re-drafting all the provisions unclear in the former insurance law -
in particular, the licensing rules for new insurers and requirements
with respect to actuaries will be described in more detail.

* Clearly defining the rights and obligations of insurance brokers.
These provisions are based on recent EU directives.

The Ministry of Finance must issue a licence for a company to set up an
insurance business. A company may not issue both life and non-life
policies. Neither can they engage in other non-insurance business. They
can only operate as joint-stock or mutual companies.

There are strict guidelines regulating reserve capital, contingency
funds compensation in the case of a lack of compulsory insurance (like
motor vehicle third party liability, fire insurance for farmers' real
estate, farmers' civil liability). The assets may be invested only in
approved instruments, with some limitation to the portfolio's
composition.

According to Ernst & Young, the Polish Finance Ministry which, for the
moment, supervises the insurance sector, is to press for a
strengthening of the capital base of Polish insurance companies. In
order to prepare domestic companies for direct foreign competition in
the domestic market after 1999, foreign companies who want to enter the
Polish market are strongly encouraged to merge with small Polish
insurance companies.

HUNGARY

The Hungarian parliament passed a new insurance law in 1995 which came
into effect on January 1 this year. All newcomers to the insurance
market must set up separate life and non-life companies. The 14
existing insurance companies will not be forced to establish new
companies but will be obliged to clearly separate accounting and
management structures for each sector.

Insurance companies will also face new minimum capital requirements
with the introduction of the distinction between organisational and
security capital, distinguishing between operational and business
commitments.

The new legislation also modifies the supervisory environment,
eliminating the need for permits for non-life products. The existing
State Insurance Supervision (ABIF) agency's remit will cover ensuring
compliance with legislation, rights protection for insurance company
clients, monitoring of applications by insurers and supervision of
companies' financial status and investment procedures.

Life insurance start-ups must continue to obtain permits for their
products and have initial security capital of at least HUF250 million
($1.8 million). New non-life operations will be required to have
security capital of at least HUF150 million and up to HUF70 million
more for certain categories of product.

Although foreign insurers are admitted only by the establishment of
subsidiary companies or through participation, the market is dominated
by outsiders.

Allianz is reportedly in negotiations with state privatisation agency
APV to sell the German group the remaining 9.2 percent public stake in
local non-life leader Hungaria. Allianz has already built up a 90
percent holding in Hungaria, which own 0.8 percent of its own stock.

CZECH REPUBLIC

The implementation of a new insurance law has been in the pipeline for
some time as the current law dates back to May 1991. In any new law,
solvency regulations are intended to be in accordance with European
Union directives.

Insurance penetration in the Czech Republic is around 2.5 percent and
like other eastern central European countries is growing. Motor
liability and occupational accident insurance is compulsory.

There are no limits on the establishment of foreign insurers but cross-
border services are not permitted. Germany's Allianz and Italy's
Generali both denied speculation recently that they were interested in
becoming strategic investors in the Czech insurance giant Ceska
Pojistovna in which private fund manager PPF (Privni Privatizacni Fond)
recently bought a 12 percent stake.

Both already have domestic Czech insurance operations which although
much smaller are more flexible and able to target the most profitable
sectors of the market.

PPF bought its 12 percent stake from Ceska Sporitelna, the former
monopoly state savings bank at the end of 1995 and is negotiating with
Interbanka, the Hungarian-owned Czech merchant bank, over its 7 percent
stake in the insurer.

PPF claimed it was a long-term investor and denied it was acting for a
third party. But analysts of the insurance industry say PPF is unlikely
to hold its stake for long, but may want to build a sizeable position
and find a strategic investor.

Although Ceska Pojistovna is losing market share as the number of
competitors swells, it still claims more than 70 percent of the main
sectors such as life and motor insurance, and its revenues are growing.
It has raised motor premiums substantially and is lobbying hard for an
overhaul of the compulsory third party sector, in which it is the sole,
reluctant provider.

Analysts also point to substantial reserves of more than CK64 billion
($2.4 billion) and numerous other activities such as fund management as
likely magnets for an investor or strategic partner, either local or
foreign.

Elsewhere, Czech health insurers were forced to reassess their budgets
in December after most had their business plans for 1996 rejected by
the government.

Only five of 27 insurers got a clean bill of health under a tough new
government fitness regime. In an effort to spruce up the industry, the
government has demanded that health insurers make more realistic income
forecasts and keep administration costs under 7 percent of revenues.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus estimated that seven of the rejected
insurers should have no trouble getting in shape by their second
attempt in January, but that still leaves 15 insurers on the critical
list.

As a result, a rash of mergers is likely to break out among the smaller
funds. But such mergers will not be easy, due to a list of problems
including long-standing debts to hospitals and doctors and difficulties
winning projected volumes of clientele.

"The system has many childhood diseases," said Frantisek Beranek,
general director of insurer Vojenska Pojistovna, referring to the fact
that the first health fund was established only in 1993. Vojenska had
its own plans rejected, but Beranek was confident of winning on appeal
after its accountants gave it a more thorough check-up.

The insurers' woes reflect the dismal state of the Czech health
industry, beset by increasingly volatile labour relations and blatant
over-billing by under-paid doctors. Insurers owe more than CK5 billion
to health providers. But even if they can pay their bills, they are
often too busy investigating claims of unnecessary treatment by doctors
who are paid per consultation.

Challenging claims is the insurers' responsibility and their only
chance to improve profitability in an industry where both premiums and
the cost of services are set by the government.

Czech health sector costs have risen from 5 percent of GDP in 1992 to
the current level of 8 percent and the government is struggling to find
a solution. It is considering a range of plans including mandating a
single agency to collect all revenues and limiting the scope of all
other insurers to offering only supplementary medical services.

If the government does choose radical surgery, the quickest recovery
may be made by the General Health Insurance Company. It was the first
to start business and it now insures 6.7 million people - well over
than half of the country.

SLOVAKIA

Insurance operations in Slovakia are governed by the insurance law of
December 1990 which was implemented in March 1991. Changes to the law
are expected to bring solvency regulations in line with EU directives.
Branch separation is planned for life and non-life businesses.

The minimum capital required to set up a non-life insurer is SK20
million-SK30 million ($672,429 - $1,008,640) and SK50 million for life
insurers. There have been no limitations on the participation or
establishment of foreign insurers since the beginning of 1992. However,
higher deposits are required for foreign establishments. Cross-border
services are not permitted. Supervision is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance.

SLOVENIA

A new insurance law, based on earlier German and Austrian legislation,
was passed in October 1995. This succeeded a law which had been in
operation since mid November 1994. However, further changes will be
needed to bring Slovenian law in line with European Union regulations.

"This law should last for about two or three years, but it must change
to open the market and align it with the EU. But Slovenian insurers are
still not prepared for competition," explained Dr Miro Koncina of ITEO
management consultants in Ljubljana.

Under the law, a guarantee fund has been established for insurance
companies consisting of DM1.5 million ($1.04 million) for life insurers
and the same for property casualty insurers. Supervision is carried out
by the Ministry of Finance. There is no branch separation between life
and non-life business, although separate accounting is required.

Majority participation by foreign insurers is possible, although this
is not the case in reinsurance companies. Foreign insurers must be
registered in Slovenia to operate there and cannot sell products from
abroad into the country.

Insurance penetration, while quite low by European Union standards, is
the highest in eastern central Europe at around 3 percent-4 percent or
DM800 million-DM900 million in premium volume. The market is continuing
to grow strongly, according to Koncina, but needs to reach a premium
volume of DM1.5 billion.

He concedes that the process of changing people's attitudes is
difficult. "The difficulty is that people are still waiting for state
social insurance," he said."We are in transition. We have a middle
class with money. We must spread this capital and this involves
changing tradition and culture. It is a process and it is changing."

The proximity of Slovenia to EU countries like Italy, Germany and
Austria is making this process of education easier, he said.

Former state monopolies still hold around 60 percent of the total
insurance market with the rest held by small independent companies and
joint ventures between Western and local firms.

In the second part of the insurance survey EEB will report on the
markets of Bulgaria and Romania, and Russia, Ukraine and Estonia.

FEELING AT HOME

It has been a hard five years, but western accounting firms are
starting to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reports

IT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, and
only now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients to
western fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with the
local Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.

Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to do
business. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keeping
control of that growth and turning it into profits is a different
matter.

Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,
the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, with
fiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking even
currently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according to
managing partner Duleep Aluwihare.

"We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some of
our more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage to
continue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,
we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run out
of investment opportunities."

Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one of
the few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although it
plans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice or
Cracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In order
to set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going to
maintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve in
this marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.

This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,
but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticket
items," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basic
work, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.

Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,
Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clients
include Poland's finance ministry.

Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.
Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrand
and Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived in
Poland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess when
the firm should start making a profit.

Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking last July before returning
to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're not just
here for a financial return on investment, we're here to make sure that
Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."

C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking at
opening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.

Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of the
market, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,
Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firm
has acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bank
and of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successes
include the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which
raised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing group
Okocim.

PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgeted
to start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,
the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After five
years in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-national
company investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growth
is running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.

PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where the
firm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clients
include Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.
One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatised
Bank Gdanski.

Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some time
are KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.

"We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner Bill
Drysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where we
are largely self-sufficient."

Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at Barents
Group, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of new
clients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firm
recently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run its
German practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have a
fully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said.
"Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."

KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics group
Siemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polish
clients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,
Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurance
companies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices in
Cracow and Poznan during the last year.

At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits gets
short shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm has
always been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financial
support from outside, other than very small amounts. All the other
firms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they have
X amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.
They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."

In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440
employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of its
rivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw and
Szczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is a
headache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line.

"Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It's
difficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated into
a corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standards
right way."

E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as much
business as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when it
hired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &
Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.

Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T.
"These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speak
only with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Often
you'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,
all the rest will follow."

The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in the
Polish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is the
smallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strong
position in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firm
took action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz as
head of the Polish business. Leslaw Paga was head of the Polish
Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.

Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is sure
that Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitely
enhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said.
"There have been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."

Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its position
in Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industries
and service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong position
in financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say we
were latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"
he explained.

Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bank
and of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's 64-
percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in the
banking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3
million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.

D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk and
Cracow during 1995.

Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.
Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four other
mid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co- ordinating
partner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "the
sort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging with
another firm.

He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name the
prospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to another
network. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we are
looking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with a
heavy UK or English language capability," he said.

Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switched
international affiliations from CKL International to Alliott Peirson
International during 1995. Baltic Accountants continues to also
represent RSM International and GMN International.

The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issue
for many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firms
like to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to local
clients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing in
Polish equity partners than others.

Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firm
holding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and US
affiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has been
given the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, while
KPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or
"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.

According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managed
firm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly-owned by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent from
the start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the local
practices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."

Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agree
that fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gap
between what western firms are charging and what local clients are
willing to pay is narrowing.

One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment must
pay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet the
market half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper local
firms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it first
arrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.
Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in
"strategic situations".

Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of a
western-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came into
effect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accounting
procedures more into line with International Accounting Standards and
to move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on tax
compliance.

Another area where western accountants are making more encouraging
noises is in relations between the international firms and the local
Chamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when the
chamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.
Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted to
the chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners that
Poland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shutting
new blood out of the profession.

Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences being
mended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciak
said. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of course
there will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.
Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bit
frightening to them."

While the situation regarding audit training and exams remains
unacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamber
will rethink its approach.

Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous in
admitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems to
have gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably be
reviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said.
"And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."

After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all part
of the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make sure
the chamber is a strong and active body."

Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and that
the growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feels
that this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We all
experience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."
