<B><I> Have there been any longitudinal studies on gifted students and the effect of 
special services such as gifted programs?

</B></I><P> There are very few longitudinal studies, but some effects can be gleaned from them.  Differentiated curriculum does have a positive effect on achievement outcomes, but other factors, such as individual persistence and sense of mission, are very important.  Programs that are entirely within a heterogeneous class are less likely to result in increased learning than other program types, perhaps because it is harder to offer the necessary consistent challenge.  Well thought out programs allowing grade or subject acceleration produce positive learning effects and do not appear to hamper social or emotional development.<P>

This report describes an extension of the Learning Outcomes Study (a 
nationwide longitudinal investigation of 1,010 students just entering programs 
for gifted learners in grades 2 and 3) to investigate excellence within each of 
the four program types considered: within-class programs, pull-out programs, 
separate classes, and special schools.  The qualitative extension focused on an 
"exemplary" model from each of the program types.  Two program evaluation 
tools, the Program Profile Form and Program Satisfaction Survey (with versions 
for students, parents, teachers, and administrators), were created to document 
key program components.  Program profiles included a description of each 
program's setting and general procedures (identification process, curricular 
options, staff selection, school demographics) and five criteria: leadership, 
atmosphere and environment, communication, curriculum and instruction, and 
attention to student needs.  In addition, ways that all selected programs 
addressed the needs of diverse populations of students were addressed.  
Appendices provide additional information on program demographic information, 
program profiles, the interview questions used, the program satisfaction 
surveys, and other research aspects of the study.  Executive Summary is also 
published separately.  (Contains approximately 95 references.) (DB)<BR>

A multivariate approach reexamined Lewis Terman's longitudinal study data 
comparing the 100 most successful and 100 least successful men identified in 
the 1920s as having very high intelligence.  Results reaffirmed the importance 
of educational attainment in vocational achievement, though intelligence and 
amount of early acceleration also predicted group membership.  (DB)<BR>

The summary report describes a 5-year longitudinal study in Calgary (Alberta, 
Canada) of gifted and talented students from grade 9 through the post-high 
school year.  Students had previously attended either a special school setting 
or were integrated with regular students in their home schools.  The study 
examined: students' achievement; their progress and well-being in academic, 
social, and personal domains; course work; transition from junior high to 
senior high school; high school graduation; and preparedness for post-high 
school life.  Subjective data obtained included the views of students, parents, 
and teachers over the 5 years.  Objective data included student scores on tests 
and academic grades.  Additional data included students' areas of strengths and 
weaknesses, choices made by students, activities engaged in, and recognitions 
they received.  General findings included: students on the whole were 
successful, well-adjusted individuals; special school and mainstreamed students 
were comparable with respect to skills, abilities, and progress in academic, 
personal, and social domains; achievement of the two groups of students was 
generally comparable; students who had attended the special school were more 
likely to report satisfaction than mainstreamed students; and fewer special 
school than mainstreamed students reported social adjustment problems at the 
postsecondary level.  (DB)<BR>

The purpose was to investigate the long-term impact of the California State 
University (Sacramento) Academic Talent Search Summer School (ATSSS) by means 
of a longitudinal follow-up of students at an interval of 4 years.  A group of 
100 academically talented middle school students (grades 7 through 9) were 
selected from the 350 participants in the ATSSS at California State University 
in 1984.  Qualifications for the program were based on scores on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test or equivalent test scores.  During the summer, students studied 
fast-paced mathematics, writing, and/or Latin.  Four years later, in 1988, a 
questionnaire was mailed to the selected students to determine their high 
school experiences.  A response rate of 80% of the 100 locatable students gave 
a sample that compared favorably with the 1984 summer school group.  Responses 
were analyzed descriptively using frequency distribution and cross-tabulation 
tables.  Results indicate that: (1) program participants viewed the experience 
as highly positive; (2) academic acceleration through the program was 
associated with positive changes in school grades as indicated by grade point 
averages, interest in school and learning, and in students' abilities to get 
along with intellectual peers, age peers, and adults; (3) the program 
contributed to self-esteem and feelings of self-control; and (4) participants 
performed well in sports as well as academics.  No pattern of social 
maladjustments or harmful results from the acceleration was found.  (TJH)<BR>

The intellectual and social abilities of young precocious children and the 
effects of educational interventions on these children are examined in this 
third year report of a longitudinal study of the developmental patterns of 
unusually precocious children.  The report focuses on several studies conducted 
with preschool and elementary school age children during the 1977-78 granting 
year.  Included are a brief overview of the project structure; test performance 
results for the 1977-78 year, (including cognitive, social, and personality 
factor data); descriptions of 3 educational intervention programs studied, and 
a report on the current status of the longitudinal study's focal group of 
"extraordinarily precocious" children.  The appendices which comprise 
approximately half the documents contain program information and related 
letters and brochures as well as 3 papers describing the identification of 
intellectual precocity in young children, social development in intellectually 
advanced children, and the tenets of the Early Entrance/Optimal Match Program.
