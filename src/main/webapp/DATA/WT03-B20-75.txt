<B>LESSONS LEARNED</B>
</center>
<P>
The accident did not affect each country in the same way and a
different emphasis was placed on various aspects of the accident
with particular reference to the circumstances of that country.
Thus, countries remote from the accident, with no domestic nuclear
power programmes or neighbouring reactors, tended to emphasise
food control and information exchange as their major thrust for
improvement. Whereas those countries which were contaminated by
the accident, and had their own nuclear power programmes and/or
reactors in neighbouring countries, drew extensive lessons from
the way the accident developed and was treated. For these reasons,
not all the lessons learned were applied universally with the
same emphasis. 
<P>
<B>Operational aspects </B>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident was one of a kind, and, although it highlighted
deficiencies in emergency preparedness and radiation protection,
it should not be seen as the reference accident for future emergency
planning purposes (<I>Bu91</I>).
<P>
It was very clear from the initial reactions of the competent
national authorities that they were unprepared for an accident
of such magnitude and they had to make decisions, as the accident
evolved, on criteria that could have been established beforehand.
This also meant that too many organisations were involved in the
decision-making, as no clear-cut demarcations had been agreed
and established. Areas of overlapping responsibility and jurisdiction
needed to be clearly established prior to any accident. A permanent
infrastructure needed also to be in place and maintained for any
efficient implementation of protective measures. Such an infrastructure
had to include rapid communications systems, intervention teams
and monitoring networks. Mobile ground monitoring teams were required,
as was aerial monitoring and tracking of the plume. Many countries
responded to this need by establishing such monitoring networks
and reorganising their emergency response.
<P>
Logistic problems associated with intervention plans, such as
stable iodine distribution (<I>Sc94</I>, <I>NE95a</I>) and evacuation
obviously needed to be in place and rehearsed long before the
accident, as they are too complex and time-consuming to be implemented
during the short time available during the evolution of the accident.
Intervention actions and the levels at which they should be introduced
needed to be agreed, preferably internationally, and incorporated
into the emergency plans so that they could be immediately and
efficiently implemented. 
<P>
The accident also demonstrated the need to include the possibility
of transboundary implications in the emergency plans, as it had
been shown that the radionuclide release would be elevated and
the dispersion of contamination more widespread. The concern,
raised by the experience of Chernobyl, that any country could
be affected not only by nuclear accidents occurring on its territory
but also by the consequences of accidents happening abroad, stimulated
the establishment of national emergency plans in several countries.
<P>
The transboundary nature of the contamination prompted the international
organisations to promote international cooperation and communication,
to harmonise actions (<I>NE88, IA94, IC90, IC92, NE93, NE89, NE90,
NE89b, WH88, WH87, IA89b, IA92, IA91a, IA89c, IA87a, IA94a, EC89a,
EC89b) </I>and to develop international emergency exercises such
as those organised by the OECD/NEA in its INEX Programme (NE95).
A major accomplishment of the international community were the
agreements reached on early notification in the event of a radiological
accident and on assistance in radiological emergencies through
international Conventions in the frame of the IAEA and the EC
(<I>EC87, IA86b, IA86c</I>).
<P>
Furthermore, in order to facilitate communication with the public
on the severity of nuclear accidents, the International Nuclear
Event Scale INES was developed by the IAEA and the NEA and is
currently adopted by a large number of countries.
<P>
The accident provided the stimulus for international agreement
on food contamination moving in trade, promoted by the WHO/FAO,
as there is a need to import at least some food in most countries,
and governments recognised the need to assure their citizens that
the food that they eat is safe. Monitoring imported food was one
of the first control measures instituted and continues to be performed
(<I>FA91, EC89c, EC93a</I>).
<P>
This event also clearly showed that all national governments,
even those without nuclear power programmes, needed to develop
emergency plans to address the problem of transboundary dispersion
of radionuclides. Of necessity these plans had to be international
in nature, involving the free and rapid exchange of information
between countries.
<P>
It is essential that emergency plans are flexible. It would be
foolish to plan for another accident similar to Chernobyl without
any flexibility, as the only fact that one can be sure of is that
the next severe accident will be different. Emergency planners
need to distil the general principles applicable to various accidents
and incorporate these into a generic plan.   
<P>
The accident emphasised the need for public information and public
pressure at the time clearly demonstrated this need. A large number
of persons who are knowledgeable about the technique of providing
information, are needed to establish a credible source of information
to the public before an accident, so that clear and simple reports
can be disseminated continuously in a timely and accurate form
(<I>EC89</I>).
<P>
Emergency plans also need to include a process by which large
numbers of people could have their exposure assessed, and those
with high exposures differentiated.  The accident also highlighted
the need for the prior identification of central specialised medical
facilities with adequate transportation to treat the more highly
exposed individuals.            
<P>
Refinement and clarification of international advice was needed
(<I>Pa88</I>). The recommendations for intervention in an accident
contained in ICRP Publication 40 were not clearly understood when
they came to be applied, and the Commission reviewed this advice
in Publication 63 (<I>IC92</I>). This guide placed emphasis on
the averted dose as the parameter against which an intervention
measure should be assessed. It was also made clear that an intervention
had to be &quot;justified&quot; in as far as it produced more
good than harm, and that where a choice existed between different
protection options, &quot;optimisation&quot; was the mechanism
to determine the choice. Emphasis was also placed on the need
to integrate all protective actions in an emergency plan, and
not to assess each one in isolation, as one may well influence
the efficacy of another.
<P>
<B>Scientific and technical aspects  </B>
<P>
Prior to the accident, it was felt that the flora and fauna of
the environment were relatively radioresistant and this was supported
by the fact that no lethal radioecological injuries were noted
after the accident except in pine forests (600 ha) and small areas
of birch close to the reactor. A cumulative dose of less than
5 Gy has no gross effect even in the most sensitive flora of ecological
systems, but there are still ecological lessons to be learned
especially on the siting of nuclear power reactors (<I>Al93</I>).

<P>
Plant foliar and root uptake is being studied, as are resuspension
and weathering.  The transfer coefficients at all stages of the
pathways to human exposure are being refined. Following the accident,
an assessment of the models used at thirteen sites to predict
the movement of iodine-131 and caesium-137 from the atmosphere
to food chains (<I>Ho91</I>) indicated that models commonly used
tended to overpredict by anything up to a factor of ten. The extensive
whole-body monitoring of radioactivity in persons undertaken in
conjunction with the measurement of ground and food contamination
allowed refinement of the accuracy of the models for human dose
assessment from the exposure through different pathways. The methods
and techniques to handle contamination of food, equipment and
soil have been improved. 
<P>
Meteorological aspects, such as the relationship between deposition
and precipitation and greater deposition over high ground and
mountains, have been shown to be important especially in the development
of more realistic models (<I>NE96a</I>). The importance of synoptic
scale weather patterns used in predictions was established, and
different models have been developed to predict deposition patterns
under a wide variety of weather conditions. The chemico-physical
changes in the radioactive gases and aerosols transported through
the atmosphere are being studied to improve the accuracy of transport
models.
<P>
Other impacts of the accident on model refinement include the
improvement in understanding the movement of radionuclides in
soil and biota, pathways and transfer factors; the effect of rainstorms
and the influence of mountains and the alignment of valleys on
deposition patterns; particulate re-suspension; long range pollution
transport mechanisms; and the factors which influence deposition
velocities (<I>NE89a</I>, <I>NE96</I>).
<P>
Uniform methods and standards were developed for the measurement
of contaminating radionuclides in environmental samples.
<P>
In the case of high exposures the importance of symptomatic and
prophylactic medical and nursing procedures, such as antibiotics,
anti-fungal and anti-viral agents, parenteral feeding, air sterilisation
and barrier nursing was demonstrated, as were the disappointing
results of bone-marrow transplantation.   
<P>
In addition, the accident led to an expansion of research in nuclear
safety and the management of severe nuclear accidents.
<P>
On the other hand, there is a need to set up sound epidemiological
studies to investigate potential health effects, both acute and
chronic. In the Chernobyl case, the lack of routinely collected
data, such as cancer registry data that are reliable enough, led
to difficulty in organising appropriate epidemiological investigations
in timely manner. There appears to be a need for developing and
maintaining a routine health surveillance system within and around
nuclear facilities.
<P>
<B>In summary, besides providing new impetus to nuclear safety
research, especially on the management of severe nuclear accidents,
the Chernobyl accident stimulated national authorities and experts
to a radical review of their understanding of, and attitude to
radiation protection and nuclear emergency issues.</B>
<P>
<B>This led to expand knowledge on radiation effects and their
treatment and to revitalise radioecological research and monitoring
programmes. emergency procedures, and criteria and methods for
the information of the public.</B>
<P>
<B>Moreover, a substantial role in these improvements was played
by multiple international co-operation initiatives, including
revision and rationalisation of radiation protection criteria
for the management of accident consequences, as well as reinforcement
or creation of international communication and assistance mechanisms
to cope with the transboundary implications of potential nuclear
accidents.</B>
