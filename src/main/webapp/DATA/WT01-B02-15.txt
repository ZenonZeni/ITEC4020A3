<P>By Christopher J. Klicka, Esq.<BR>

<P>Many education officials publicly claim that teachers need special &quot;qualifications&quot; in order to be effective.  As a result, public education organizations sometimes target home schoolers with legislation or an interpretation of the law which would require parents to have one of three qualifications: (1) teacher certification, (2) a college degree, or (3) passage of a &quot;teacher's exam.&quot; <BR>

<P>Although this seems reasonable on the surface, such requirements not only violate the right of parents to teach their children as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but virtually all academic research documents that there is no positive correlation between teacher qualifications and student performance.<BR>

<P><B>Academic Research on Teacher Qualifications</B><BR>

<P>The following summary includes several research projects and opinions of professional educators, confirming the absence of a positive correlation between teacher qualifications and student performance:<BR>
<ol><li>One of the most significant studies was performed by Dr. Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester, who surveyed the results of 113 studies on teacher education and qualifications.  Eighty-five percent of the studies found no positive correlation between the educational performance of the students and the teacher's educational background.  Although 7% of the studies did find a positive correlation, 5% found a negative impact.</li><BR>
<li>Dr. Sam Peavey, Professor Emeritus of the School of Education at the University of Louisville, earned advance education degrees from Harvard (Master of Arts) and Columbia (Doctor of Education) and was involved in the preparation of thousands of prospective teachers for state certification.  He has served on numerous committees and commissions dealing with the accreditation of schools and colleges.  On September 30, 1988, Dr. Peavey testified before the Compulsory Education Study Committee of the Iowa Legislature on the subject of teacher qualifications, citing numerous studies.  He stated:<BR>
<blockquote>May I say that I have spent a long career in developing and administering programs for teacher certification.  I wish I could tell you that those thousands of certificates contributed significantly to the quality of children's learning, but I cannot. .  .  .  After fifty years of research, we have found no significant correlation between the requirements for teacher certification and the quality of student achievement.</blockquote><BR>
Later in his testimony, Dr. Peavey explains that he has found one valid way of identifying a good teacher:<BR>
<blockquote>However, in spite of years of frustration, I am pleased to report to you there has been discovered one valid, legal, honest, professional, common-sense way to identify a good teacher.  As far as I know there is only one way, and it is about time for legislators to recognize it and write it into school law.  It involves a simple process.  Step one is to stop looking at the teachers and start looking at the students.  Step two is to determine how well students are learning what they are supposed to be learning.  The quality of learning provides the only valid measure of the quality of teaching we have yet discovered.</blockquote><BR>
Dr. Peavey concluded his testimony with practical examples of excellent student achievement by students who were being taught by their parents, most without degrees or certificates.  He explained that many studies demonstrate that home-schooled children &quot;commonly score a year or more above their peers in regular schools on standard measures of achievement.&quot;</li><BR>
<li>Dr. Donald Ericksen, professor of education for the University of California at Los<BR>
Angeles, stated in a recent interview:<BR>
<blockquote>Some of the worst teachers I've ever seen are highly certified.  Look at our public schools.  They're full of certified teachers.  What kind of magic is that accomplishing?  But I can take you to the best teachers I've ever seen, and most of them are uncertified . . . .  We don't have evidence at all that what we do in schools of education makes much difference in teacher competence.</blockquote><BR>
In a well-known case before the Michigan Supreme Court, concerning a Christian school's challenge to the state's teacher certification requirement, Dr. Ericksen testified as an expert witness on teacher certification.  There he explained that extensive research has established that no significant correlation exists between certification (or teacher qualifications) and student learning and that student testing is a far superior method of determining teacher effectiveness.  Dr. Lanier, an expert who testified on the side of the state in favor of teacher certification, admitted under oath that she was unaware of any empirical evidence establishing any correlation between teacher certification requirements and student learning or teacher competence.</li><BR>
<li>Two education researchers, R.W. Heath and M.A. Nielson surveyed 42 studies of<BR>
&quot;competency-based&quot; teacher education.  Their findings were that no empirical evidence exists to establish a positive relation between those programs and student achievement. </li><BR>
<li>L.D. Freeman, R.E. Flodan, R. Howsan, and D.C. Corrigan did separate studies in<BR>
the effectiveness of teacher certification requirements.  They all concluded that there is no<BR>
significant relation between teacher certification and teacher performance in the classroom. </li><BR>
 <li>C. Emily Feistritzer, Director of the private National Center for Education Information, claimed in a recent interview that she does not know &quot;of a single study that says because a teacher has gone through this or that program, he or she is a better teacher.&quot;  Supporters of teacher training programs &quot;argue eloquently that teachers need to be grounded in all of these things, but there has yet to be a study that shows that in fact this is the case.&quot; </li><BR>
<li>John Chubb, a fellow at the Brookings Institute (a liberal think tank), extensively studied various popular reforms including the push to professionalize teaching, the toughening of teacher certification standards, and the implementation of more extensive teacher evaluation systems.  As a result, he authored a book with Terry Moe, Politics, Markets, and America's Schools, on the subject of educational reform.  Mr. Chubb found &quot;no correlation between student achievement and any of the variables on which school reformers have been concentrating so much time, effort, and money.&quot;  He continues, &quot;There is little reason to believe&quot; that these actions will improve student achievement and &quot;there is considerable reason to believe they will fail.&quot; </li>  <BR>
<li>Dr. Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute released a report entitled, A Nationwide Study of Home Education: Family Characteristics, Legal Matters, and Student Achievement.  This was a study of over 2000 home school families in all 50 states.  The research revealed that there was no positive correlation between state regulation of home schools and the performance of home-schooled students.  The study compared home schoolers in three groups of states representing various levels of regulation.  Group 1 represented the most restrictive states such as Michigan; Group 2 represented slightly less restrictive states including North Dakota; and Group 3 represented unregulated states such as Texas and California.  Dr. Ray concluded:<BR>
<blockquote>. . . no difference was found in the achievement scores of students between the<BR>
three groups which represent various degrees of state regulation of home education . . . .  It was found that students in all three regulation groups scored on the average at or above the 76th percentile in the three areas examined: total reading, total math, and total language.  These findings in conjunction with others described in this section, do not support the idea that state regulation and compliance on the part of home education families assures successful student achievement.</blockquote><BR>
Furthermore, this same study demonstrated that only 13.9 percent of the mothers (who are the primary teachers), had ever been certified teachers.  The study found that there was no difference in students' total reading, total math, and total language scores based on the teacher certification status of their parents: <BR>
<blockquote>The findings of this study do not support the idea that parents need to be trained and certified teachers to assure successful academic achievement of their children.</blockquote><BR>
This study has been confirmed by two other studies.  <BR>
<ul><li>Dr. J.F. Jakestraw surveyed the student performance of home schoolers in Alabama and reported:<BR>
<blockquote>This finding suggests that those children in Alabama whose parent-teachers are not certified to teach perform on standardized achievement tests as well as those whose parent-teachers are certified to teach.  Therefore, it is concluded that there is no relationship between the certification status of the parent-teacher and the home-schooled children's performance on standardized achievement tests.</blockquote></li><BR>
<li>Jon Wartes also performed a similar study on home schoolers over three years in the state of Washington and reached the same conclusion.</li></ul><BR>
<li>On the whole, home schoolers' achievements are ranked above average on standardized achievement tests as demonstrated by Dr. Ray's findings in the study cited above (see #8) and in The Right Choice: Home Schooling, which summarizes approximately 35 more studies documenting the success of home schooling.  Dr. Ray and others have found that only 35% of teaching mothers have a college degree or higher and yet their children score no higher on standardized achievement tests than those being taught by mothers without a college degree.</ol><BR>
<B>Conclusion of Academic Research</B><BR>

<P>In conclusion, nearly all existing research on teacher qualifications or state regulations demonstrates that they have no significant relation to student performance.  In fact, teacher qualification requirements have no positive correlation with even teacher performance.  In the end, as the Coleman Report (U.S. Office of Education, 1964) pointed out, families are the most important factors in determining a student's academic performance.<BR>

<P><B>Statutory Trend Lessening Teacher Qualification Requirements</B><BR>

<P>The trend across the United States is not to apply any teacher qualifications standards to home schoolers.  The emphasis seems to be on protecting parental rights and in several states, focusing on student performance through an annual test or portfolio evaluation.<BR>

<P>As of April 1994, forty states do not require home school parents to have any specific qualifications.  Home schoolers in these states can home school without proof of any particular educational qualifications.  In fact, of the ten states that do have qualification requirements, eight of them require only a GED or high school diploma. The states in this category are North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, and New Mexico.  Of the remaining two states, only North Dakota requires the passage of a &quot;teacher's test,&quot; and West Virginia requires the parent's education to be at least four years higher than his child's.  New Mexico required a bachelor's degree, but this requirement was repealed in 1992, leaving a high school diploma or GED as the standard.  South Carolina also previously required a college degree or a teacher's examination, but this was struck down by the South Carolina Supreme Court in Home School Legal Defense Association's (HSLDA) case Lawrence v. South Carolina Board of Education, 412 S.E.2d 394 (1991).  South Carolina now only requires a GED or high school diploma.  Tennessee used to require that parents who were teaching children in high school have a college degree.  In 1994, this was amended to allow parents to teach their high school-aged children with only a high school diploma or a GED as long as they were under the supervision of a &quot;church-related school.&quot;  Michigan was the last state to require home school parents to have teaching certificates.  Many states formerly had a law like Michigan's, but such teacher qualifications requirements were abandoned.  On May 25, 1993, the Michigan Supreme Court struck down the teacher certification requirement as unconstitutional in HSLDA's case, People v. DeJonge, 501 N.W.2d 127 (1993).  Under DeJonge, religious home schoolers have no qualification requirements.<BR>

<P><B>Major Cases on Teacher Qualifications for Home Schools and Private Schools</B><BR>

<P>The list below contains several cases in various states which dealt with the issue of teacher qualifications and found teacher certification requirements or college degree requirements to be excessive or unconstitutional.<BR>
<ol><li><B>New York:</B>  In New York, instruction &quot;elsewhere&quot; must be given by a &quot;competent&quot; teacher.  3204. The court has interpreted competent not to mean certified. In re Franz, 55 A 2d 424, 427 (1977).  Furthermore, home school regulations adopted in June 1988 do not require home school parents to have any qualifications.  Home school parents are &quot;competent&quot; as long as they file a notice of intent, quarterly reports of progress, and test results every other year beginning in third grade.</li><BR>
<li><B>New Jersey:</B>  New Jersey allows &quot;equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school.&quot; <BR>
18A:38-25. Regarding the interpretation of the word &quot;equivalent,&quot; the New Jersey Supreme Court stated: &quot;. . . perhaps the New Jersey Legislature intended the word equivalent to mean taught by a certified teacher elsewhere than at school.  However, I believe there are teachers today teaching in various schools in New Jersey who are not certified . . . .  Had the legislature intended such a requirement, it would have said so.&quot;  New Jersey v. Massa, 231 A.2d 252, 256 (1967).</li><BR>
<li><B>Ohio:  </B>Ohio law [Ohio Rev. Code Ann.  3321.04(A)(2)] requires home school<BR>
teachers to be &quot;qualified.&quot;   State Board of Education regulations define &quot;qualified&quot; as a GED or high school diploma.  (See Ohio State Board of Education Administrative Code Chapter 3301-34.)  Prior to these regulations, in Ohio v. Whisner, 47 Ohio St.2d 181, 214 (1976), the Ohio Supreme Court struck down Ohio's Minimum Standards which required teacher certification, stating &quot;And equally difficult to imagine, is a state interest sufficiently substantial to sanction abrogation of appellants' [parents'] liberty to direct the education of their children.&quot;  The Court also pointed out that the state &quot;did not attempt to justify (prove) its interest in enforcing the minimum standards (which included teacher certification requirements) as applied to non-public religious schools.&quot; Id. at 217.</li><BR>
<li><B>Michigan:</B>  On May 25, 1993, Michigan's teacher certification requirement for home school parents was struck down by the highest court in the state.  The Michigan Supreme Court declared:<BR>
<blockquote>In summary, we conclude that the historical underpinnings of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the case law in support of it compels the conclusion that the imposition of the certification requirement upon the DeJonges violates the Free Exercise Clause.  We so conclude because we find that the certification requirement is not essential to nor is it the least restrictive means of achieving the State's claimed interest.  Thus, we reaffirm that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people.  We hold that the teacher certification requirement is an unconstitutional violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as applied to families whose religious convictions prohibit the use of certified teachers.  Such families, therefore, are exempt from the dictates of the teacher certification requirements.</blockquote><BR>
This decision vindicates the dissent in a three to three split of the Michigan Supreme Court in 1986 in a private school case involving the requirement of teacher certification.  In this case, Sheridan Road Baptist Church, three justices found:<BR>
<blockquote>...enforcement of the teacher certification requirement, as applied, is not essential to achieve the objective.  Unless and until the state can show otherwise, the enforcement of the statutory teacher certification requirement, as applied, would be violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote></li><BR>
<li><B>Indiana: </B> Indiana allows home schools under their law which exempts children from compulsory attendance if they are &quot;provided with instruction equivalent to that given in public schools.&quot;  20-8.1-3-34.  A federal court when trying to interpret the word &quot;equivalent&quot; stated &quot;. . . it is now doubtful that the requirements of a formally licensed or certified teacher . . . would pass constitutional muster.&quot;  Mazenac v. North Judson-San Pierre School Corporation, 614 F.Supp. 1152, 1160 (1985).  The Court would not interpret &quot;equivalent instruction&quot; as requiring certified teachers because of the constitutional problems involved.</li><BR>
<li><B>Massachusetts:</B>  In this state, &quot;a child who is otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent . . .&quot; is exempted. ch. 76, 1.  When establishing guidelines for approving home schools, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated that the superintendents or school committees could not require the parents to be certified or have college degrees.  The Court said: &quot;While we recognize that teachers in public schools must be certified, certification would not be appropriately required for parents under a home school proposal. . . .  Nor must parents have college or advanced academic degrees.&quot;  Care and Protection of Charles, 504 N.E.2d 592, 602 (Mass. 1987).  In fact, the home school mother in this case, in whose favor the Court ruled, did not even have a high school diploma. 504 N.E.2d at 594, fn. 2.</li><B> </B><BR>
<li><B>Kentucky: </B> In Kentucky, home schools operate as private schools.  When private<BR>
schools were required to use certified teachers even though the statute was unclear, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that teacher certification did not apply to private schools and could not be mandated.  See Kentucky State Board v. Rudasill, 589 S.W.2d 877, 884 (1977). </li><B> </B><BR>
<li><B>Hawaii:  </B>In Hawaii, &quot;parents teaching their children at home shall be deemed qualified instructors.&quot;  Dept. of Ed. Regs. 4140.2(D)(2).  In other words, parents are qualified because they are parents. </li><B> </B>  <BR>
<li><B>South Dakota:  </B>In South Dakota, a child formerly was allowed to be &quot;otherwise provided with competent instruction.&quot;  However, in 1993, that statute was amended specifically to delete the term &quot;competent&quot; thereby removing all qualification requirements on parents who teach their own children.  Nonetheless, a safeguard remains in the statute which states &quot;the individuals [who give instruction] are not required to be certified.&quot;</li><B> </B>  <BR>
<li><B>North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa: </B> In all three of these states, teacher certification<BR>
requirements were upheld by the courts.  See North Dakota v. Shaver 294 N.W. 2d 883 (1980), Nebraska v. Faith Baptist Church, 301 N.W. 2d 571 (1981), and Fellowship Baptist Church v. Benton, 815 F.2d 485 (1987).  In each of these cases no expert testimony or evidence was given to prove teacher certification was necessary or essential for children to be educated.  In fact, the state could also not prove, with evidence, that teacher certification was the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; for children to be educated.<BR>
<p>Furthermore, the legislatures in all three of these states have mooted these cases and vindicated home schooling parents by repealing the teacher certification requirements.  Nebraska and Iowa have created an option in their compulsory attendance statutes to allow parents to home school without any qualifications.  North Dakota allows parents to pass a &quot;teacher' test&quot; in order to opt out of teacher certification.  [See Revised Stat. of Nebraska  79-1701(3); N.D. Century Code 15-34.1-03; and Iowa H.F. 455(1991)]</li><B> </B></ol><B> </B>    <BR>
<B>Conclusion</B><BR>

<P>Educational research does not indicate any positive correlation between teacher qualifications and student performance.  Many courts have found teacher qualification requirements on home schoolers to be too excessive or not appropriate.  The trend in state legislatures across the country indicates an abandonment of teacher qualification requirements for home school teachers.
