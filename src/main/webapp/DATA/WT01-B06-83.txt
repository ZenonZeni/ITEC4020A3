Mutual Fund Services: Investing and Redeeming Shares </H2><P>
<HR>

Mutual funds services can often help you manage your investments in a simpler, more efficient manner. That includes the buying and selling of fund shares. Whether you are making a single transaction or setting up a systematic plan, a variety of options exist for investing and redeeming mutual fund shares.<p>


What are your options and how can they best be utilized?<p>


The traditional way of investing in a fund is simply to place a check in the mail. But it could take up to a week--or longer--for your money to arrive and be put to work. By letting a few days elapse you risk paying more per share for a volatile fund than you had expected. Of course, if you're lucky you might pay less.<p>


It frequently makes sense to have a better idea about the price you will pay, especially if you're going to invest a fairly large sum in a more volatile fund. By taking action prior to 4 p.m. Eastern time, it's possible to buy at the price prevailing on the day you place your order. Of course, the price you'll pay is not the only consideration--putting the money to work sooner is beneficial to fixed-income investors who are placing a large amount--say $50,000 or more--into an account and don't want to wait to begin accruing dividends.<p>


There are several ways to accomplish the purchase of shares at that day's net asset value:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transfer from a money fund.</strong> You can park your investment in the family's money market fund, wait until you're ready to invest, call the company before 4 p.m. Eastern time and request that the funds be transferred to the portfolio of your choice. Of course, you can usually also transfer from other bond and equity funds in the group.<p>


<li><strong>Wire transfer from your bank.</strong> This is the quickest way to move money and is especially recommended for large sums. You will buy in at the day's net asset value if the wire arrives at your account prior to 4 p.m. Eastern time. Your fund company will provide the instructions that you need to convey to your bank. Banks generally charge for this service but mutual funds usually do not. <p>


<li><strong>Telephone purchase.</strong> Some companies allow you to place a purchase order by phone, locking in that day's price if your order is entered before 4 p.m. Eastern time. You give your instructions to the telephone representative, then send a check or wire for the cost. The payment must reach the account in five or seven business days (depending on the requirements of the company), otherwise the order will be canceled with the investor assuming any resultant losses. Some funds will only accept wires for telephone purchases.<p>


There are special conditions that need to be satisfied when you place a telephone purchase order. These requirements, which vary by company, typically include investment minimums and maximums. Minimums may or may not be higher than the fund's usual investment minimum and could be $5,000 or $10,000. The maximum may be based on the total value of your existing accounts with the family. The details should be spelled out in the prospectus. It's best to verify the information with a shareholder representative before entering your order.<p>


<li><strong>Opening a new account by wire.</strong> A number of mutual funds allow you to establish an account by wire, provided you promptly send in a completed application and wire in the cost of your shares. If your wire arrives at your new account before 4 p.m. Eastern time you will buy at the current day's price. Again, there are minimum investment requirements and other details that vary by fund. The first step is to phone the fund for instructions.<p>
</ul>

The best way to build up your mutual fund assets is simply to put money to work on a regular basis. Systematic investment plans offer an ideal way to do this. With fixed, periodic investments, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when they're high. This results in a lower average cost per share than a simple average of prices on your purchase dates. Dollar-cost averaging works especially well with more volatile portfolios.<p>


There are several ways periodic investments can be made automatically, without sending in a check.<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct, systematic transfers.</strong> The systematic investment program, where money is taken either from your bank account or paycheck, transfers a predetermined, fixed amount at approximately the same date each month. In order for the payments to be routed directly from your bank account, your financial institution must be an Automated Clearing House (ACH) member, which most are. If you want the investment deducted directly from your paycheck, you need your employer's consent.<p>


<li><strong>Dividend transfers.</strong> By investing periodic distributions received from one mutual fund into shares of another in the same family, you can build a position in the latter. For example, the monthly dividends from a fixed-income fund could be moved into an aggressive growth portfolio.  Another example might be the transfer of quarterly income dividends and annual capital gains distributions from an equity-income fund into shares of a money market fund or shares of a short-term bond fund.<p>
</ul>

A variety of useful approaches are also available when you need to withdraw money from your mutual fund.<p>


Mailing in a redemption letter is the old-fashioned way to withdraw money from a fund account. The letter must contain the necessary information--including name(s) of registered owner(s), fund name, account number and redemption amount--and be properly signed by the account owner(s). You may need a signature guarantee for your request to be processed.<p>


There are several faster, simpler ways to redeem shares. Be sure to sign up for these additional services, if necessary.<p>

<ul>
<li>Requesting a check by phone. You may telephone your shareholder representative and request that a check be mailed to you or your bank. Of course, you lose interest during the mail transit time, an important consideration with larger redemptions.<p>


<li>Drawing a check on a fixed-income fund. You can write a check on a money market or other fixed-income fund, perhaps on money just transferred in from another portfolio in the family. Funds generally place a minimum, commonly $100 or $500, on individual checks. If you draw your check on a fund with a fluctuating share price, it would give rise to a taxable event. Money market funds ordinarily maintain a stable $1 price, so you need not be concerned about taxable events when drawing checks on these funds.<p>


<li>Wiring money from your fund. You can request your company to wire the proceeds to your bank account. This is the quickest way to make a direct transfer of money, and it is recommended for large sums. Your bank and fund will tell you about their fee policies.<p>


<li>Making an ACH redemption. If you have established an Automated Clearing House linkage between your fund and bank, you can simply phone your company and request that the balance be transferred to your bank. However, it could take a few days for the money to reach your account.<p>
</ul>

Systematic withdrawal plans are useful for retirees and others who want to receive regular monthly or quarterly checks. The payments could be sent to someone besides the account holder, such as a student in college or another dependent. A certain minimum account balance, such as $10,000, is required to establish the program. You can change your withdrawals or discontinue them at will. Most funds offer systematic withdrawal programs.<p>


While withdrawal plans are a useful service they can lead to certain problems.  For instance, recordkeeping for tax purposes can be a headache, especially with more frequent redemptions. Each time you make a withdrawal you're selling shares, which results in a taxable event. You need to adopt a systematic procedure for calculating gains and losses on each withdrawal. In addition, volatile, aggressive growth and sector equity funds (like gold portfolios) are generally poor candidates for withdrawal plans. These funds can plunge as fast as they can surge. Withdrawing money when the value of your account has taken a steep decline can lead to problems if it doesn't rebound quickly.<p>


Also, it's a good idea to reevaluate your situation every year or so if you are using the systematic withdrawal option. Do some revised number-crunching to see if you need to make any adjustments in your withdrawals.<p>


Shareholder services can help make your dealings with a fund simpler, more efficient and more pleasant--and possibly a bit more profitable. Keep in mind that there are differences in the services offered by different funds, and differences on restrictions or conditions they may place on their use. There may also be charges for some services such as wire transfers and telephone exchanges. Fund companies will provide you with details.<p>
