VIETNAM: MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Thu Hanh

There were few domestic toys for sale for the Mid-Autumn Festival
this year. This is a common comment of shoppers during their buying
sprees for children prior to their festival that fell on the 15th
of August of the lunar calendar (Sept.27,1996).

Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival is a tradition in Vietnam.
Although it is a children's festival, it is a common concern of
society, because on this day children in almost every family must
have a tray full of "banh nuong" (pies) and "banh deo" (sticky rice
cakes), a grapefruit, a bunch of bananas, persimmons, "com"
(steamed young rice dyed green), and toys such as paper lion heads,
small drums, star-shaped lanterns, or turning lanterns with a shade
decorated with paper cut figures.,to celebrate the Mid-Autumn
Festival.

A couple of weeks before the festival, the toys shops along Luong
Van Can, Hang Ma and Cha Ca streets and in front of Lenin, Thu Le
and Bach Thao parks were already stocked different kinds of paper
masks, lanterns, dolls and electronic toys. In general, the toys
were attractive looking and selling at cheaper prices than last
year. For instance, a small lantern made in China cost 9,000-12,000
VND, and a bigger battery-operated musical lantern cost
17,000-30,000 VND. A turning lantern sold for 20,000-30,000 VND.
During the pre-festival days, even the poorest parents tried to buy
some toys they could afford for their children. A mask, a
star-shaped lantern, or a small drum cost only 1,500-5,000 VND.
Well-to-do families preferred modern toys, each of which might cost
from several hundred thousand to even several million VND.

Hanoi's wholesalers sold toys to traders from the outlying
districts of Dong Anh, Soc Son and Thanh Tri, Ha Dong town in Ha
Tay province, and Ha Bac, Hai Hung and Nam Ha provinces. However,
except for paper masks, lanterns and drums, not many toys were made
in Vietnam. Currently, there are only a few toy-making enterprises
in Hanoi such as the Phuc Hung Plastics Company and the Dai Kim
enterprise. But these enterprises only produce toys for the
education programs of kindergartens, and they cannot compete with
Chinese and Thai toy-makers in terms of quality, designs and
prices. Furthermore, these Chinese and Thai products have often
been smuggled without tariffs and, naturally, are sold at cheaper
prices. So far, stuffed animals made by the Hung Sang and Binh Tien
companies have won the trust of customers for their high quality
and diversified designs, but their prices are still high for most
customers. For instance, a little Mickey bear costs 7,000 VND, and
a bigger one costs as much as 250,000 VND.

On the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the confectioneries,
state-owned or private, produced about 200 tons of pies and sticky
rice cakes with different fillings: green beans, salted eggs,
Chinese sausage, roast chicken and vegetarian. A box of 4 pies or
sticky rice cakes costs between 20,000 and 80,000 VND. The prices
this year were higher than last year because of a 10-20% increase
in prices of ingredients. The Thuy Ta restaurant by the side of
Hoan Kiem Lake and the Bodega Foods and Drinks Company were the
main suppliers of pies and cakes; each produced about 50 tons. In
addition, Xuan Dinh village in Tay Ho district with 60 years of
experience supplied 80 tons of pies and cakes. Among the most well
known non-state confectioneries supplying pies and cakes for the
Mid-Autumn Festival are the Bao Ngoc, Huong Nam and Duy Tan shops.
However, some unlicensed private shops produced poor quality pies
and cakes causing a feeling of uncertainty among customers.

VIETNAM: NGUYEN TU NGHIEM, THE CULMINATION OF AN ARTISTIC CAREER

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Pham Thi Tuyet

Nguyen Tu Nghiem, one of the seven prominent painters in the
generation trained during the war against the French colonialists,
received the Ho Chi Minh Award on his 75th birthday. He is one of
the three living painters in his generation to receive this prize
instituted by the Vietnamese Government in 1985 to  honour the
writers, artists and scientific workers who have best contributed
to national liberation and construction.

The old artist was sitting in his small garden  absorbed in
memories as we arrived in  his small flat at the government-leased
TrungTu apartment building.His young wife was preparing dinner.

"It's a real pity, a real pity, " he repeated as he took us around
the small room hung  with recent paintings which serves as his
exhibition room. He said that almost all his paintings made during
the  anti-French war have been lost. He estimated it was
approximately one hundred paintings.He recalled with a deep sigh of
regret and a lowered head the loss of hundreds of paintings done by
himself and Bui Xuan Phai,  his alter ego and another winner of
this Ho Chi Minh Award. The two were preparing an art exhibit when
French troops parachuted on the resistance base  in the northern
jungle and destroyed or took away all the sketches and canvasses
they had completed during the first years of the war.

One thing that intrigued me right after scanning  the scores of
paintings in his room is the predominance of paintings about
"Kieu",  the main character in a novel the same name. Each painting
was executed differently on a different material. Explained the old
artist:"It is like the haunting of all my life. I made a clay
figurine of Kieu when I was only a six-year-old  kid in my native
village in Nghe An province and started to paint its face as best
as I could imagine from the story related by my father. Although
the story of Kieu originated in China, the Kieu created by Nguyen
Tu Nghiem's brush, is always every inch a Vietnamese girl, a
Vietnamese beauty. Another favourite theme of his is the mythical
Giong, the child hero who defeated the aggressors and saved the
kingdom after being transformed into a giant with a fire breathing
horse from a heavenly messenger. Nguyen Tu Nghiem also has done
painstaking research into the regional folk dances which he
reconstructed so well that some critics called them the most
perfect collection of folk dances of Vietnam. He distinguishes
himself by the original way he executes his lacquer paintings. A
famous case depicts the " Guard of the Temple of Literature" (in
Hanoi). The whole picture is painted in white lacquer but with
varying thicknesses of paint which create different nuances and
shades. The same can be found in his painting titled "The  Gate of
Mong PhuVillage during Harvest Time". This work is so evocative
that one admirer exclaimed:" It makes me feel as if I could hear
the croaking of the frogs in the painting."

Nguyen Tu Nghiem is one of eight painters and sculptors receiving
the Ho Chi Minh award this time. Five received the award
posthumously.

VIETNAM: THE HANOI FINE ARTS SCHOOL, ONE OF THE OLDEST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Nguyen Luong Tieu Bach
Associate Professor, Director of the Hanoi Fine Arts School

The Hanoi Fine Arts School is rightly described as the"cradle of
Vietnam's modern arts." Founded in 1925 by the French as the "
Ecole des Beaux Arts de l'Indochine," it was the first formal art
school in  Vietnam. Prior to this, Vietnam as well as Laos and
Cambodia had no institutions for formally training painters and
sculptors. There were only small groups of artisans who learnt
their techniques from their parents and grandparents and perfected
them through extensive work in handicraft workshops. In this sense,
the modern arts taught at the Fine Arts School of Indochina were
divorced from the artistic traditions of the nation. Art students
were given classes chiefly in the European, more particularly the
French classic arts. But this deviation was soon discovered by the
first crop of Vietnamese students who, coincidentally, were to
become also the most prominent artists of modern times. Such names
as To Ngoc Van, Nguyen Phan Chanh, Tran Van Can and Nguyen Gia Tri
are icons in the pantheon of Vietnamese modern painting.
Increasingly, this first generation of graduates and their
successors realized the crucial need of using their art in the
service of the people; this tendency was displayed through the
resistance against the French war of reconquest (1946-1954).
Teachers and students, sometimes without even an easel, packed
their minimum indispensable working tools in a rucksack and went to
the front to record scenes of battles or the combatants in the
hours between battles, or the seemingly endless throngs of men and
women transporting supplies to the front. In the twenty-year fight
to liberate South Vietnam, the Hanoi Arts School had more
opportunity to concentrate on large scale training. After the
reunification of the country in 1975, training was no longer
limited to Hanoi. Now there are also art schools in Hue (Central
Vietnam) and Ho Chi Minh City. This has enabled the Hanoi school to
raise its  standard and  concentrate on university-level tranining
and, eventually, post-graduates training in painting and sculpture.

The opening up to the world has also opened broad vistas for the
Hanoi Arts College to increase its exchanges with artists in
countries in the region and across the world. More and more
painting exhibitions have opened in the country and abroad. Higher
sales of paintings are not only bringing higher material benefit to
the artists but also have raised the profile of Vietnamese arts in
the eyes of local and foreign art lovers.

The improved living standards in the country have also expanded the
market for art and motivated artists to make consistent efforts to
improve themselves. Outdated models, styles and genres can no
longer capture the vast horizon of present day life. Artists,
mostly  from the younger generation, venture out  into their
changing environments in search of new modes,  materials, and
styles of expression.

Many graduates of the school have won prizes abroad. For example,
Nguyen Thu now at the exhibition of realist painting in Bulgaria,
and Dinh Trong Khang in the international art expo in the former
Czechoslovakia. 95% of the  awards  at  annual art exhibitions
inside the country are won by artists trained by the Hanoi school.

VIETNAM: MARIJUANA ADDICTION SPREADS TO ALARMING PROPORTIONS AMONG SCHOOL
CHILDREN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By  Lan Huong

Recently the press has sounded the alarm about the spread of
marijuana addiction among schoolchildren, and educators have raised
their voice about the need to stop this social vice.

In HCMC marijuana has found its way through the school gates in
hand-rolled cigarettes while in Hanoi schoolchildren buy heroin,
burn it on a piece of tin foil, and inhale it as a way of
relaxation. According to a report by the Interior Ministry,
students began to smoke opium in 1993 and the addiction has been
spreading ever since. In Hanoi over the past year, nearly 80 school
children and college students were caught in the act of using
marijuana. This figure, of course, reflects only a small percentage
of the actual users, but it reveals an alarming social phenomenon.
Many schoolchildren lacking the money to buy marijuana have joined
gangs riding high-powered motorbikes to rob people. A report from
the Hoan Kiem police precinct (Hanoi) said police had captured a
gang of 8 young robbers who admitted to having committed 50
robberies in a period of one and a half months.

Who then are the suppliers of marijuana to schoolchildren and
college students? Tracking down marijuana rings has revealed the
availability of these toxic drugs at tea shops located near
university and college campuses. These tea shop owners eager for
profits have sold marijuana to students, even though they are well
aware that selling marijuana may bring them from 5 years to life
imprisonment and even the death penalty. In one case, an entire
family consisting of 11 members from grandparents to grandchildren
was engaged in drug trafficking. Since the Government issued a
decree on strengthening the fight against smuggling and drug
trafficking, smugglers and drug traffickers have adopted more
cunning methods of operation to evade the police.

Speaking of drug addiction among schoolchildren, Ms. Nguyen Thi
Hung Cuong, Vice-Chairwoman of the People's Committee of Quang Ninh
province, said the province has sounded the alarm about drug
addiction among schoolchildren. Quang Ninh province has taken
measures to prevent addiction by making the commitment between the
schools and families to strengthen the management of
schoolchildren, build walls around schools, increase school
patrols, and remove tea shops located near schools.

Mr. Nguyen Minh Chanh, Vice-Director of the HCMC Labour, War
Invalids and Social Affairs Service, said cigarette peddlers have
sold marijuana to schoolchildren and students in hand-rolled
cigarettes. When they get addicted, they have turned to
pickpocketing to get money for drugs.

Mr. Tran Xuan Nhi, Vice-Minister of Education and Training, said
the education service should do all it can to prevent the spread of
drug addiction among schoolchildren and students. The service has
introduced anti-marijuana lessons in the school curriculum at all
levels. It has given special attention to such lessons at the
schools in mountain eous areas to help prevent the cultivation of
the opium poppy there.

The coordination of anti-marijuana efforts among the police and
customs services, the schools, and the families is essential to
help curb the spread of a social vice that is affecting
schoolchildren and students now.

VIETNAM: REFORM OF STATE ENTERPRISES CONTINUES

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Doan Huong Lan

The reform in the organisation and operation of the State economic
enterprises has resulted in a dramatic reduction of State-owned
enterprises from 6,300 entities in 1990 to 516.

Meanwhile, the combined liquidity of the State-run enterprises rose
3.5 times or an annual increase of 30.1% and output value rose
11.3% on a yearly average. Its gross profit almost quadrupled to
7,100 billion VND between 1990 and 1994. Meanwhile losses dropped
from 503 billion VND to 300 billion VND.

State-run enterprises are still predominant in key industries such
as energy generation, chemistry, iron casting and food processing,
which over the past 5 years have recorded an annual growth of 20%,
20,1%, 16.1%, and 13.6% respectively. However, small and
medium-scaled business with old and obsolete equipment still
account for a large proportion in the State economic sector. Thirty
five per cent of all State-owned enterprises are employing less
than 100 workers each and 50% have a legal capital of less than 3
billion VND (270,000 USD).

Shortage of capital remains as acute as ever. Liquidity can meet
only 60% of the demand, which is estimated at 20 billion VND,
excluding the cost of capital construction and upgrading of
equipment.

Only 20% of the value of the industrial products of the State-owned
enterprises have been exported.

VIETNAM: ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN A VICE

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Ha Linh

The more than 100 Vietnamese enterprises in electronics are finding
themselves in a vice: If they want to survive the harsh competition
from such world giants as Sony, Matsushita, Philips, Samsung and
Technics, they have to accept working as subcontractors for them in
joint ventures in which their share is always very far from giving
them a significant say. But if they choose to stay on their own,
chances are high that they will meet their foretold death earlier
than they think.

In both cases, chances for Vietnamese to develop an electronics
industry of their own are very slim, if any at all.

The quick fix backfires

To be fair, it is the foreign electronic companies which have
helped the local electronics industry to get to where it is today.
In the late 70s and early 80s, Vietnamese enterprises were allowed
to import semi-knocked-down parts to assemble TVs and radio
cassettes and many of them indeed made a fortune out of it.

The policy proved to be an important quick fix, for the country was
then faced with a dire shortage of consumer electronics goods.
Consumers had to import TV and radio cassettes on their own,
further straining the country's scarce reserve of hard currencies.

The arrival of foreign electronics manufacturers on the market and
the emergence of joint ventures provided a strong stimulation for
local manufacturers to strive more. But problems soon cropped up,
one after another. The foreign companies which used to sell
components to Vietnamese assemblers no longer do so if the latter
are not their joint-venture partners. But once the Vietnamese are
in the joint ventures just to keep their production alive, they
lose their autonomy in production because they never have the
necessary capital to hold a controlling share in the ventures. And
all this happened on the same market that the Vietnamese used to
have the last say. Moreover, most joint ventures only sell their
products in Vietnam, just as Vietnamese assemblers did in the past.

One of the pioneer assemblers of electronics goods in Vietnam,
Viettronics Tan Binh, is finding itself at a loss in this dilemma.
For years, it had been making a good buck assembling and selling
Sony and JVC TVs. But as soon as Sony officially entered the
Vietnamese market, it had no choice but joining the Sony-controlled
venture if it wants to retain the privilege of assembling Sony
TV's. Tan Binh was harder pressed for there were many other smaller
Vietnamese assemblers were waiting on the sideline for a chance to
take its place. Experts predicted that when JVC comes in, it is
likely that Tan Binh will have to set up a similar joint venture
with it as well.

Problems

It would be no problem if the joint venture brings more benefits to
the local company and promises it a stronger future development. In
reality, benefits from the joint venture have come to only those
sections of the local company which work for the joint venture. The
rest suffer real losses because their market is already taken away
by the joint venture's products. Viettronics Thu Duc, an assembler
of the same calibre as Viettronics Tan Binh, is an example. Its
joint venture with Matsushita to assemble Panasonic TV has
benefited only the sections which work for the venture. The rest of
the enterprises now has enough work for only four days a week.

Economists see more problems than that. They said that in joining
ventures with world electronics giants, Vietnamese manufacturers
are losing at least two opportunities for their own development.

First, they said, as foreign companies come, many Vietnamese
assemblers have already set up modern assembly lines which are not
any inferior to those brought in by the foreigners. Now, that they
are already part of the joint ventures, Vietnamese tend not to make
sizable reinvestments in keeping their technological edge. Further,
the Government's slowness in taking action to protect local
industries has discouraged them from attempting to keep this edge.
The result is a virtual hand-over of the playground to the foreign
companies.

The second lost opportunity is their miss in grabbing the market of
telecommunications products as this industry is fast expanding in
the past couple of years. Experts said that if Vietnamese had been
quick enough, they could have easily taken control of this market
which has now become almost a open ground for foreign suppliers.

The sole solution

Recently, as the Hanoi Electronics Company (Hanel) announced that
next year, it will market the first Hanel TV sets with at least 60%
local content, the news was received with mixed feelings. Many
other Vietnamese electronics companies may have also thought of
producing something of their own, but doubts about the
competitiveness of their products against those made by
foreign-invested joint ventures discouraged them from going any
farther. There are also doubts that any local banks would be
willing to finance such local ventures.

"As for now," commented an industry expert, "the only choice for
Vietnamese electronics manufacturers seems to join a
foreign-invested venture. But this virtually amounts to an
on-the-spot export of labour in which they will sell their skilled
labour for a living and a marginal benefit."

This expert also said that the only solution to the problem rests
with the local manufacturers themselves. "They need to fend for
themselves, and in the process, they need the Government to provide
them with the necessary protection through appropriate policies and
financial support.

THE LABOUR MARKET IN VIETNAM: MR TRAN DINH HOAN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Thanh Tai

Labour and the labour market are both an urgent, permanent question
in Vietnam. Vuong Thanh Tai, a VNC correspondent, has just
interviewed Mr Tran Dinh Hoan, associate professor,Ph.D candidate,
Minister of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, on this issue.

VNC: What do you have to say, Minister, about labour and the labour
market in Vietnam?

TDH: Vietnam has a population of 75 million of whom population of
37 million of working age. Each year, 1.15-1.2 million more people
come of working age.

The rural areas make up 76% of the total workforce and the urban
areas, 24%. The urban areas have a 6.1% unemployment while 30%, and
in some places even 40-50%, of the rural workforce is partially
unemployed. The state-owned sector employs about 3 million workers
who account for 8.5% of the total work force.

Since Vietnam began the renewal process, the labour force in the
state-owned sector has been reduced considerably as a result of the
re-organisation of production. Simultaneously the labour force in
the foreign-invested and private sectors has rapidly increased
thanks to the encouragement of foreign investment in the developing
multi-sector economy. The demand for labour has fluctuated greatly
as the supply-demand process, in each sector of the economy affects
the wages offered as well as the number and skills of needed
workers.

VNC: Is there any contradiction between the availability of labour
and the demand for labour as required by the industrialisation and
modernisation processes?

TDH: The most noticeable contradiction can be seen in the supply
and demand of skilled workers. Currently, Vietnam has more than 4
million trained workers, just 10.7% of the total workforce,
distributed primarily in urban centres, in the state-owned sector.
As the cause of industrialisation and modernisation demands a large
contingent of skilled workers, the Party and the State have
encouraged diverse forms of job-training. The 8th National Party
Congress in its Resolution called for increasing the skilled
workforce to 22-25% of the total labour force by the year 2000. It
is also necessary to adjust the current training structure which
has a ratio of 1-1.6-3.6 for university graduates, high school
graduates and skilled workers, respectively. The ratio in developed
countries is 1-4-10 respectively.

As the foreign-invested sector is developing vigorously, the demand
for skilled high-tech workers will also grow rapidly. Therefore,
the system of training centres must  combine formal class room
training with on-the-job training and access to the latest in
high-tech equipment meet this specific demand.

VNC: What is the solution to unemployment and a more efficient use
of intellectual workers?

TDH: With a  market economy, unemployment is common in developed or
developing countries. Since Vietnam began to shift over to the
market mechanism, there have been signs of unemployment. For
instance, a population census conducted in 1989 showed an
unemployment rate of 4%. This rate grew to 9% in the first years of
the 1991-1995 plan. A labour and employment survey in urban areas
in 1994 pointed to an unemployment rate of 6.1% in urban areas and
7% in major towns. Currently, the jobless in Vietnam are estimated
at 2.5-3 million people.

Over recent years, the State has issued policies encouraging job
creation. The best results were obtained in 1995 when jobs were
created for more than 1 million persons, equal to the number of
persons  coming of working age each year. The Ministry of Labour,
War Invalids and Social Affairs has, together with the other
ministries and branches concerned, built a national job generation
program and is elaborating an insurance system for the unemployed
to submit for Government approval.

On the other hand, the solution to a more efficient use of
intellectual workers focuses on 5 causes of the irrational use of
intellectual workers. First, there must be a plan to adapt training
to the demand of employment. Second, a labour market must be
created to help intellectual workers find suitable employment in
their profession. Third, a policy must be issued encouraging
intellectual workers to work in those areas which have a great
demand for them. Fourth, a suitable wage scale must be developed
for those intellectual workers working in a field outside their
profession. And fifth, those intellectual workers in the
state-owned sector who have been made redundant by the
administrative reforms and the re-organisation of production must
be re-employed in other branches.

VNC: What comment do you have on the labour market in
foreign-invested enterprises? on the strikes by workers and the
maltreatment of workers by foreign employers?

TDH: Foreign investment is a strategic factor helping to accelerate
the renewal of the economic structure, the industrialisation of the
economy, and the generation of employment. That's why, over recent
years  the labour market in this sector has developed vigorously
and now employs more than 85,000 workers. This sector is demanding
more and more skilled workers in industrial production. The demand
for labour by foreign-invested projects in agriculture, forestry
and fisheries is growing continually because  the cost of
generating employment  in these branches is lower than in
industrial production.

During the 1991-1995 period, the demand for labour by
foreign-invested enterprises gradually shifted from the South to
the North and the Centre. Because this sector pays higher wages for
qualified skilled labour. About 70-80% of the workers in this
sector are skilled labour,About 90% of the labour force employed by
this sector are urban workers.

Of the 214 strikes since 1989, 79 have been in state-owned
enterprises, 93 in foreign invested enterprises, and 42 in private
enterprises. During the same period, there have been 32 cases of
maltreatment of workers, including 18 cases in enterprises invested
by ROK employers. These cases have all been settled by the agencies
concerned by means of warnings, imposing fines, forcing
compensation for the economic damage, deportation, and even legal
prosecution.

To ensure a good relationship between workers and employers, to
prevent strikes and to stop maltreatment of workers, it is
necessary to set reconciliation councils, arbitration councils, and
labour courts. For the time being, each province and city must set
up a working group composed of representatives of the branches
relating to labour employment, help to form trade union
organisations, improve the efficiency of labour inspection
organisations, and control implementation of the Labour Law.

VIETNAM: FIRST ALL-WOMEN ART EXHIBITION

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Hoang Yen

They are three women who share the same ambition to make powerful
representations of their artist visions on the canvasses. Thus, a
group exhibition of 70 of their favourite paintings was opened at
a Giang Vo Street gallery in Hanoi.

In fact, none of them is a professional artist. Le Minh Ha works at
Vietnam Airlines, Vo Thanh Huong at the Archaeology Institute, and
Nguyen Hong Hanh at the Oil and Gas Corporation. Something that
stands out as one enters the gallery is the variety of subjects
that have come under the optical as well as visionary perceptions
of the three artists whose well-travelled records are beyond
dispute.Another common denominator is their training at the same
Hanoi College of Industrial Arts. But the similarities end there.
Vo Thanh Huong tends toward a forceful realism which catches her
subjects in their most natural, deepest   self-expression: "
Farewell", "Streets", Still Life," and "Palm Trees" are  some of
the best  illustrations.

Nguyen Hong Hanh is more pensive and romantic in her paintings
"Young Women Returning from the Market", "Boats on the Red River,"
Dusk on Tam Bac River" and "Peacock Displays Its Plumage". On the
other hand, Le Minh Ha  prefers stronger colours in her paintings
of "Sundown on the Suburban Village", "Street on the Seashore",
"Bluebell Flowers".

A tentative attempt to venture into the strange waters of
surrealism can be detected in the "The Mark of Time" by Le Minh Ha
who seems to arrange things and feelings according to her
perceptions of time and space. For Nguyen Hong Hanh, space becomes
more unreal, more introspective in  Spring Comes over Dien
Bien".Occasionally, Vo Thanh Huong departed from her mainstream
style and  reverted  to tradition by making black the dominant hue
on her canvasses.

VIETNAM: ORIGINALITY AMONG PAINTERS OF THE YOUNG GENERATION

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Hoang Yen

As the market economy has opened new outlets for all kinds of arts,
originality has become a distinctive mark for which all painters,
especially those of the young generation, are aspiring and striving
for. How these young painters are trying to establish their
hallmarks, in other words, to carve a name among the multitude of
artistic displays, is approached by VIETNAM COURIER'S HOANG YEN, in
her recent interviews with a cross section of painters.

Doan Van Nguyen, 49,  lecturer at the Hanoi Arts College whose
specialization is lacquer painting. Nguyen has had several of his
works displayed at the Vietnam Arts Museum and the Oriental Arts
Museum in Russia:

"Originality and popularity must go side by side and in most cases
must mingle. Lacquer painting is not unique for Vietnam but its
materials and mode of expression must be an original art of
Vietnam. In this sense, while preserving the national tradition,
lacquer painting has to absorb elements of modernity of the world.
I would stress that in any case, quality must come first and this
is what differentiates one artistic work from another.

An ever larger proportion of the newly enrolled students wish to
learn lacquer painting, perhaps because this remains a genre of art
which still opens many windows for innovation. There is, however,
the risk of confounding the lacquer painting art with the
traditional craft of making lacquer ware for votive or decorative
purposes."

Pham Anh Thuy, 40, a graduate of the oil painting section of the
Hanoi Arts School:

"My first training was architecture and I got my civil engineering
diploma from the Hanoi Building College in 1980. Frankly speaking,
the economic reforms which are going on have offered me a vast
opportunity to make a fortune by using my capacity as a
construction engineer. But I later enrolled inthe Arts Collge
because I felt that painting, especially oil painting, is my
vocation.  I could not live without it even though I know that not
all artists are economically secured to devote themselves entirely
to art. In any case, the business world is not my stuff and I feel
much freer in the world of artistic creation."

Van Thuyet, 42, free-lance painter, who lives a spartan life with
his small vendor wife in a 20m2 room in Tran Nhat Duat street,
Hanoi:

"As you can picture for yourself, the life of a free lance artist
is anything but easy.People call me a surrealist, abstractionist or
something like that. I like to paint things which exist in my own
imaginary world, a world that no living human might have
visualized. Perhaps for this same reason  very few are those who
share my visions and still fewer are those who bought my paintings.
Once I got 1,000 USD for a painting and on another occasion I sold
a bronze statue for 3,000 USD. But these are my chance once in a
life time, so to speak."

Ta Hai, Head of the Youth and Children Program of the Voice of
Vietnam Radio:

"My main job is a radio reporter but I can't do without painting.
I take a special liking for painting on dead leaves. I consider
this to be the best method of achieving self - perfection. I
treasure all I have created after weeks, months and even years of
persistent and laborious work and was always caught between a sense
of regret and self - satisfaction when someone asked to buy a work
of mine. I do not want to part with my own creations but at the
same time it  comforts me to know that my work has been justly
appreciated. The only material of my paintings are the dead leaves,
pressed flower petals, a sheath of an areca leaf, in a word
everything that comes from the plants and trees. I want to preserve
nature and make the best of its beauty.

Young artists of today are more and more inclined to paint
abstractions. Not a few have succeeded but many others have failed
because they have cut themselves off from the practice of life,
that is, from the own source of their creation."

Phan Thi Lan Huong, 40,born in Hue city and teaching arts in Qui
Nhon town,Binh Dinh province, Central Vietnam. She is holding an
exhibition at 29, Hang Bai Street,Hanoi:

"I paint mainly on silk but I also make paper cuts and also try my
hand at lacquer. My favourite colour is black, not because I took
a dim view of life but  only to give greater relief to the bright
spots such as red, yellow and white.A  viewer of my paintings said:
"Your pictures give me a sense of true relief."That may be too
flattering a word but the fact remains that I want to impart the
sense of beauty and relaxation to people around me. This is also
perhaps why I like to paint women and nature.

At this exhibition alone I have sold ten paintings, the highest
priced is 1,000 USD. I consider myself much luckier than my
colleagues in Qui Nhon and other small towns. I'm looking forward
to some practical aid from the Vietnam Arts Association to help
painters in small towns like Qui Nhon also to have access to the
large public including foreign art lovers and researchers."

Quach Dong Phuong, teacher at the Hanoi Arts College:

"I have painted all these twenty years and my subjects are nothing
but scenes of daily life: going to the market, replanting rice,
family visits.... Some people rightly noted that the conical palm
leaf hat is nearly omnipresent in my pictures. I want in fact to
"personalize" my works by the conical hat, but not that alone. I
think that the conical hat is a traditional trait of the nation
which must be preserved in any form, including painting and
sculpture.

I am listed among the "richest" among Vietnamese painters. That may
be true or not, but the fact remains that I have sold many
paintings to several countries in Asia such as Singapore, Japan and
South Korea. Some European countries have also displayed my works.
I am told that they like my paintings because they combine very
successfully modernity and traditionality."

Nguyen Quoc Huy, 25, graduating from the Hanoi Arts College in
1994:

"Freedom of creation is my guiding principle and my greatest source
of self satisfaction. It might have been different if I had been
born in earlier times when everything depended on the government.
Now we have opened all the windows to the world, including the
artistic window. This enables us young painters and sculptors to
broaden our perspectives through increasing exchanges with the
outside artistic world. Lacquer paintings is my preference and is
a relatively safe way of making a living. If you are lucky enough
to sell two, or even one, lacquer paintings, it might sustain you
and your family for a whole year. When things go awry, I take up
other genres such as designing book covers, or painting posters and
advertisements".

VIETNAM: GROWING PRESENCE OF YOUNG PAINTERS, A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Duong Tuong

Painters 23 to 40 years of age account for 60% of the membership of
the Vietnam Fine Arts Association, according to Ms. Vu Giang Huong,
General Secretary of the Association.

The common and easily discredible trait of all the galleries and
exhibition is the growing presence of the young generation of
artists. It is that the older generation of artists has died or
silently withdrawn from the art market. Exhibitions by such
luminaries like Nguyen Tu Nghiem and Diep Minh Chau still attract
a large number of visitors, but they are greatly outnumbered by the
exhibitions of young painters who accounted for 400 of the 650
exhibits in 1995. "That is a welcome development," said Dzu Thanh,
a senior member of the Arts Association because they have been, and
will be, the vanguard to integrating Vietnamese art onto the world
scene. They are also the most dynamic force to vitalize and
diversify painting and sculpture in our country. All styles, genres
and perspectives are being accepted provided they do not run
counter to Vietnamese traditions. The young artists are eager to
test their worth through galleries and exhibitions which open
almost weekly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the two largest art
centres of the country. Their presence might also be the best
influence to eliminate all that is extravagant and eccentric.
Censorship in the truest sense of the word belong to the public,
not to any vested power. Some tendencies toward eccentricity and
eroticism have been quickly dismissed by the public even though the
press rarely interferes in these so-called "experimentation".Ta
Hai, an art lecturer commented: "I am a painter myself but I must
confide that some  enigmatic and eccentric paintings are past
comprehension or unstandable only to their author. In my view, the
search for the new must not allow us to disregard the public".

VIETNAM: YOUTH UNION RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT HIV/AIDS

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

A two-day conference on HIV/AIDS was held in Hanoi on Sept. 23-24
to raise public awareness about the HIV/AIDS disease and its
dangerous effect on youth.

Reports made at the conference said over 50% of HIV infected people
are between 15-24 years of age and in some places the rate of
HIV-infected girls is double that of HIV-infected boys in the 15-19
age group.

The conference aimed to raise public awareness about the epidemic
and seek solutions to prevent it from spreading. Participants in
the conference called for innovative partnerships and efficient
assistance among government agencies, communities, non-governmental
organisations, families of infected people and the private business
sector to help promote efforts against HIV infection.

Speaking at the conference Dr. Roy Morey, UN Resident Co-ordinator
and UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, said: "As elsewhere,
recognition and acceptance that everyone is at risk, and therefore
has a part to play in overcoming the AIDS epidemic, are key in
reversing the trend of rising infection rates".

Mr. Steve Kraus, Country Programme Advisor for UNAIDS, called for
special efforts "To provide this education to all children and
youth, especially those who are harder to reach such as children of
minorities, indigenous people, and street children."

A two-year UNDP project launched in early 1996 has selected Vietnam
as a priority for its assistance. The one-million USD project is
aimed at enhancing Vietnam's capacity to plan and coordinate the
implementation of policies and programme for the prevention of HIV
infection and care of HIV-infected people.

Funding for the conference has come from Vietnam's National AIDS
Committee, America Online, John Snow Inc., Health Ed and UNDP.

VIETNAM: COAL INDUSTRY NEEDS OVER 9 TRILLION VND UP TO 2010

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Quynh Trang

Sources at the Vietnam Coal Corporation (VINACOAL) said that the
coal industry will need about 9.4 trillion VND between now and 2010
to boost its production.

This sum, the sources said, is included in a development plan for
the industry for the period.

Under this plan, the development of the coal industry is to be made
in two stages. The first stage now to 2000 requires capital of
3,400 billion VND. The second stage  from 2000 to 2010, requires
capital of 5,900 billion VND.

Mr. Doan Van Kien, general director of VINACOAL, told VNC that in
1996, the industry's output may reach 9 million tons. In 2000, it
may increase to 12 million tons/year, instead of 10 million tons as
so far projected.

A problem for the industry, said Mr. Kien, is how to expand its
market outlets. VINACOAL has set in exports an annual target of
between 3 and 4 million tons/year in the upcoming years. In the
first 9 months of this year, its exports have reached 2.3 million
tons. Mr. Kien also said that VINACOAL has signed long-term
contracts to export coal to Japan and a number of northern European
countries.

VIETNAM: LEATHERWARE INDUSTRY LOOKS FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

Sources at the Vietnam Leatherware Association said that the
leatherware industry is looking for some 465 million USD in
investment to improve its technologies, boost its output by 2.5
times and triple its export value to 1 billion USD by 2000.

The industry plans to acquire this investment capital through
selling stocks, attracting foreign direct investment, and taking
bank loans.

Of late, the industry has shown good signs of improvement, with its
turnover up by 462% compared with the same period last year. In the
first eight months of this year, it is expected to achieve an
output of 250 million pairs of shoes and 5,500 tons of products
made of genuine or imitation leather, and gross 685 billion VND,
17% higher than the whole  of 1995.

The leatherware industry has been rather attractive to foreign
investment. Of the more than 100 leatherware businesses in the
country at present, 12 are joint ventures and 22 are fully
foreign-owned.

VIETNAM: NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLASTICS INDUSTRY

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Le Thanh Huyen

It is not by chance that the recent Asian Plastics Forum in Ho Chi
Minh City attracted more than 200 delegates from various regional
manufacturers, including 51 from Japan. Vietnam has in recent years
become a potentially lucrative market for plastic products. Not
only has its need for materials for plastics production increased
steadily, from 100,000 tons/year in 1992 to 300,000 tons in 1995
and a projected 370,000 tons in 1997, but its fast-growing oil
industry is also making it a potentially important supplier of
materials for the plastics industry.

Growing need

Industry experts are unanimous that Vietnam's need for materials
for plastics production will increase much faster in the next three
to five years. Auto plants, telecommunications equipment factories,
cement plants, and many other industrial projects under
construction will be requiring quality plastic products.

Cement officials, for instance, said that their industry alone
will, by the year 2000, need about 300 million plastic bags.
However, all they have now is a small mill in Can Tho which
produces only 14 million plastic bags/year.

For the time being, the country's need for materials for plastics
production is being met mostly by imports from Southeast Asian
countries. Only 4% of those materiatls, however, are used in
high-quality products. But this situation is expected to change in
a few years when the country's petro-chemical industry is ready to
begin production.

Already, Petronas, the Malaysian oil producer, has invested 4
million USD in helping the Vietnamese Government design the
blueprint for its petro-chemical industry. Meanwhile, Mitsui of
Japan is applying for a license to invest in building an
82-million-USD mill attached to the oil refinery to be built at
Dzung Quat in central Vietnam.

According to a plan being designed by the Ministry of Industry,
Vietnam will be producing each year starting in 2010, about 500,000
tons of PVC, 330,000 tons of PP, 200,000 tons of PS, and 75,000
tons of DOP.

Industry experts predict that given its good resources, Vietnam can
then focus more on producing materials for plastics production
rather than manufacturing plastic consumer goods as it has been so
far. The plastic products it produces then should be mostly for
high-end markets.

The needed investment

According to the Vietnam Plastics Corporation, Vinaplast, in order
to reach the above targets, the Vietnamese plastics industry should
invest at least 1 billion USD between now and the year 2005, mostly
in high-tech plastics. Thus they could reduce the volume of plastic
consumer goods from the present 60% of total output to only 20%.
About half of this investment is planned to come from foreign
sources through joint ventures or loans schemes.

Officials of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) said
that they have so far licensed 30 investment projects in the
plastics industry, with a total capital of 330 million USD. Twelve
of these projects are wholly foreign-owned.

However, the officials also said that most of these projects are
small and focused only on producing consumer goods. There have been
so far only two projects for producing PVC compound, two others
producing PVC resin, and a 15-million-USD project in plastic
insulation for electronic parts, they said.

One of the projects to produce materials for the plastics industry
is the Oxy-Vina, a 109.4-million-USD joint venture among  Tramasuco
and VietGas of Vietnam, Oxychem of the US, and Marubeni of Japan to
produce PVC compound. It is located in Ba Ria-Vung Tau and is
scheduled to start operation in 1999. As this article goes to
press, it is reported that Petronas of Malaysia is negotiating a
deal to take over Oxychem's share in this joint venture.

The other on-going materials  projects include the 92-million-USD
joint venture between Vinaplast and Mitsui of Japan which is to
start producing 80,000 tons of PVC resin/year in 1997 and the
12-million-USD joint venture between Vinaplast and Lucky GoldStar
of South Korea which is to produce 30,000 tons of DOP/year.

VIETNAM: ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN DILEMMA: OUTGROWING THE TIGHT
SHIRT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Quynh Trang

The electricity industry is caught in a dilemma. On the one hand,
it is being told to produce, between now and the year 2000, about
30 billion kWh/year to meet the needs of the economy. On the other
hand, it has not yet acquired the capital to develop both its
generating capacity and its electric grid to match the economy's
growth, let alone double the 1995 output of 14.6 billion kWh in
only four years.

In a recent interview with VNC, Mr. Truong Bao Ngoc, deputy general
director of the Vietnam Electricity Corporation (VEC), said that
for the electric industry to fulfil its plan, it needs an
investment of about 6 billion USD in the 1996-2000 period. But, he
said, our biggest problem now is finance. We are not in any
position to balance our budget and make significant investments in
developing power resources and a distribution network. Demand has
been increasing faster than the supply and this may result in a
power shortage in the 1996-98 dry seasons. The power grid is either
overloaded or inefficient in many places".

In search of a solution

To help the electricity industry overcome its financial problems,
the Government has allowed it to retain all its capital
depreciation fund for the period from now until 2000 for
reinvestment. It is also allowed to increase electricity prices by
about 70% during this period (the maximum expected to be 800 VND or
about 0.70 USD for a kWh) and mobilise funding from other domestic
sources. However, experts said, all these new funds will, at best,
meet only 30% of the industry's financial needs. The rest will be
made up by loans from foreign banks and financial institutions such
as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

An important form of investment is coming through
Build-Operate-Transfer projects  or joint ventures. By now, the
industry has had three BOT projects which are expected to be
completed before 2000. They include the 300-MW thermo-electric
power plant (phase I) in Quang Ninh province, the 600-MW
gas-operated power plant II (phase II) in Phu My, Ba Ria-Vung Tau
province and the 620-MW gas-operated power plant III, also in Phu
My, Ba Ria-Vung Tau. They will be followed by a number of other
power projects, in both northern and southern provinces. It is
projected that the BOT plants will generate about 30% of the total
output of all domestic power plants.

A problem with the BOT plants which is being addressed is the
timing of their transfer. Because of the low price of electricity
in Vietnam, which is meant to keep it within the reach of most
low-income customers, an early transfer will make BOT electricity
too expensive. Meanwhile, a prolonged transfer which would keep the
price low, would result in a relatively higher depreciation 1 on
equipment.

Whatever the solution may be, it will be carefully balanced to make
the output price reasonable for both the project owners and
customers, industry sources said.

For the immediate future, the industry is taking measures to ensure
a stable power supply. These measures include upgrading existing
coal- and diesel-fuelled power plants and accelerating the
construction of on-going power projects. There are also measures
planned to reduce the electricty loss in transmission to 0.5% each
year from now to 2000.

Experts at the FPT, a leading Vietnamese computer dealer, said that
Compaq products are accounting for almost 20% of the local computer
market.

Compaq's market share in many other countries has been only 10% or
less, the experts said.

first six months of this year, Compaq fulfilled 66% of its sale
plan for the year.

Still, according to Mr. R.Sivadas, Compaq owes its market share in
Vietnam to its high quality products and good maintenance services.

Compaq is selling its products in Vietnam through a dealer network
which includes 3C, Dong Nam Associates, Quang Minh and Thakaral

Sources at the Daewoo group of South Korea said that they are still
determined to continue their joint venture with the Hanoi Bus
Service Company to build an integrated bus service in the
Vietnamese Capital City.

The project is still under consideration by the government even
though it was signed two years ago.

A reason for this delay is that many people have been skeptical
about its profitability since it would cost a rather huge amount.

The project has a total investment capital of 136 million USD to
which Vietnamese side is to contribute 30%.

A ground for hope for the investors is the recent government
approval of the allocation of 26 ha of land area for the operation
of a public bus system in Hanoi.

The government has encouraged both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to
develop their public transport systems. Recently, it has effected
a temporary halt on the licensing of new taxi companies and now
only licenses bus companies.

VIETNAM BEGINS MAKING DIARRHEA MEDICINE FOR CHILDREN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Pham Thanh Thuy

An oresol production factory has just been put into operation in
the central coastal province of Khanh Hoa to help fight against
diarrhea among children under 5.

For the first time Vietnam can produce this medicine, which
according to a World Health Organisation study, is quite effective
in the treatment of diarrhea, one of the six child killers.

The factory, capacity 10 million packs/year, can meet the national
demand, which is estimated at 4 million packs/year for diarrhea and
about 6 million packs for other diseases such as malaria and Dengue
fever.

In the first year of operation, the factory is expected to turn out
2 million packs and will increase the production in the following
years until it runs at full blast.

More than half of the project cost of 750,000 USD is funded by the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as part of its package aid
for the National Programme for Control of Diarrhea Disease (CDD).
Since 1984 UNICEF has granted CDD about 400,000 USD/year in medical
personnel training and supply of oresol. The programme is covering
95% of villages and communes throughout the country.

VIETNAM: THE LU PEOPLE

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

The Lu have about 3,700 inhabitants settling in two districts of
Phong Tho and Sin Ho of Lai Chau province.

The Lu are also called Lu, Nhuon and Duon. Many ancient vestiges
are found in Dien Bien, but there are a few Lu people living there.
Lu language belongs to the Tay-Thai group.

The Lu have practised farming from time immemorial. They plough and
harrow the fields, dig canals for irrigation, sow rice seeds and
transplant rice, but do not weed or use fertilizers. The Lu also
use burnt-over land to grow corn, cassava, groundnut, indigo and
cotton. Every family has its private garden around their house. The
Lu's staple food is sticky rice. They like to drink tea and men
like to smoke tobacco with bubble pipes.

Weaving is the most widespread sideline occupation. Each family has
several looms. The Lu are very skilful in weaving, sewing and
embroidery. Their garments are decorated with colourful motifs on
dark indigo cloth.

The Lu live in houses on stilts. The back - side of the roof is
shorter than the front one which reaches down to cover the corridor
and stairs. The entrance door faces northwest. Each house has two
kitchens, one used to cook daily meals and the other to boil water.

Young men and women are free to choose their partners. The
fortuneteller plays an important role in the matching of a couple.
The husband must live with the wife's family for two or three years
before building their own home. The children take the father's
family name. All Lu boys have the common mid-name Ba and the girls,
the mid-name.Y. The Lu are friendly and faithful. Divorce is rare.
As is the custom, he or she who asks for a divorce will be fined.

Buddhism is the predominant religion. After the dead person is
