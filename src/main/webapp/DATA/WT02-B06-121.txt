<h2>Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</h2>

<font size = +1>
<p>31.  The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. 
It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smaller
groups of linked computer networks:  a network of networks.  This
is best understood if one considers what a linked group of
computers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what it
does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called
"local area networks").  For example, in many United States
Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purpose
of exchanging files and messages (and to share equipment such as
printers).  These are networks.  In the language of the Act,
these networks would each be termed an "interactive computer
service."

<p>32.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to
other computers or networks (although the Act still directly
applies to such closed local area networks).  Many networks,
however, are connected to other networks, which are in turn
connected to other networks in a manner which permits each
computer in any network to communicate with computers on any
other network in the system.  This global web of linked networks
and computers is the Internet.

<p>33.  This amalgam of computers and computer networks --
some owned by governmental and public institutions, some owned by
non-profit organizations, and some privately owned -- lacks any
central control or supervision.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, unrestricted global medium of communications -- or
"cyberspace" -- that links individuals, institutions,
corporations, and governments around the world.  This
communications medium allows any of the literally tens of
millions of people with access to the Internet to exchange ideas,
research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound, or simple
electronic mail with others on the Internet.  These
communications can occur virtually instantaneously, and can be
directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of
individuals interested in a particular subject, or to the world
as a whole.

<p>34.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an
experimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency
("ARPA").  First called ARPANET, the network linked computers and
computer networks owned by the military, defense contractors, and
university laboratories conducting defense-related research.  The
network later allowed researchers across the country to access
directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at
a few key universities and laboratories.  As it evolved far
beyond its research origins in the United States to encompass
universities, corporations, and individuals around the world, the
ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally just
the "Internet."

<p>35.  From its inception, the network was designed to be
a decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant links
between computers and computer networks, capable of rapidly
transmitting communications without direct human involvement or
control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or
otherwise unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant, self-
healing system of linked computers was designed to allow vital
research and communications to continue even if portions of the
network were damaged.

<p>36.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and
ultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged
the creation of multiple links to and from each computer (or
computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located in
Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated
telephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on
the Eastern seaboard.  Each of those computers would in turn be
linked to numerous other computers, which themselves would be
linked to other computers.

<p>37.  A communication sent over this redundant series of
linked computers could travel any of dozens of routes to its
destination.  Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,
D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sent
to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a
computer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt
Lake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the message
could not travel along that path (because of military attack,
simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message would
automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be
re-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then
to Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and
finally to Palo Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing,
would likely occur in a matter of seconds.

<p>38.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it
subsequently ceased to exist), similar decentralized networks
developed to link universities, research facilities, businesses,
and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. 
Eventually, each of these networks (many of which were
overlapping) were themselves linked together, allowing users of
any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is
this series of linked networks (themselves linking computers and
computer networks) that is commonly known today as the Internet.

<p>39.  No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or
non-profit -- controls, governs, or runs the Internet.  It exists
and functions solely as a result of the fact that hundreds of
thousands of separate operators of computers and computer
networks independently decided to use a common data transfer
protocol to exchange communications and information with other
computers (which in turn exchange communications and information
with still other computers).  There is no centralized storage
location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would be impossible for any single entity to
regulate the information conveyed on the Internet.

<p>40.  The nature of the Internet is such that it is
impossible to determine its size.  However, it is indisputable
that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in the
past few years.  In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to
the Internet, and by 1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000
computers.  By 1993, however, over 1,000,000 computers were
linked.  Today, it is estimated that over 9,400,000 host
computers worldwide are linked to the Internet, and this count
does not include the tens of millions of personal computers used
by individuals to access the Internet using modems (as detailed
below).  In all, reasonable estimates are that over 40 million
individuals around the world can and do access the enormously
flexible communication medium of the Internet.  That figure is
expected to grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.
