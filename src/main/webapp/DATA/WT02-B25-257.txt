<H2>POLICY ON INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT</H2>

<HR>
POLICY ON INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT AND COURT ORDERED TREATMENT
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) believes that
all people should have the right to make their own decisions about
medical treatment. However, NAMI is aware that there are certain
individuals with biological brain disorders (also known as severe
mental illnesses) such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness
who, at times, due to their illness, lack insight or judgement
about their need for medical treatment.  NAMI is also aware that,
in many states, laws and policies governing involuntary commitment
and/or court ordered treatment are inadequate. 
<P>
NAMI, therefore, adopts the following policy:
<P>
1. The availability of effective, comprehensive community-based
systems of care for persons suffering from biological brain disorders
will diminish the need for involuntary commitment and/or court
ordered treatment. 
<P>
2. Methods for facilitating communications about treatment preferences
between individuals with biological brain disorders, family members
and treatment providers should be adopted and promoted in all
states.
<P>
3. Involuntary commitment and court ordered treatment decisions
must be made expeditiously and simultaneously in a single hearing
so that individuals can receive treatment in a timely manner.
 The role of courts should be limited to review to ensure that
procedures used in making these determinations comply with individual
rights and due process requirements, and not to make medical decisions.

<P>
4. Involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and court ordered
treatment should be used as a last resort and only when it is
believed to be in the best interests of the individual in need.
  
<P>
5. States should adopt broader, more flexible standards which
would provide for involuntary commitment and/or court ordered
treatment when an individual: 
<P>
(A). Is gravely disabled, which means that the person is substantially
unable, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for any of
his or her basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health
or safety, or
<P>
(B).Is likely to substantially deteriorate if not provided with
timely treatment, or
<P>
(C).Lacks capacity, which means that as a result of the brain
disorder the person is unable to fully understand or lacks judgment
to make an informed decision regarding his or her need for treatment,
care or supervision.
<P>
6. Current interpretations of laws which require proof of dangerousness
often produce unsatisfactory outcomes because individuals are
allowed to deteriorate needlessly before involuntary commitment
and/or court ordered treatment can be instituted.  When the &quot;dangerousness
standard&quot; is used, it must be interpreted more broadly than
&quot;imminently&quot; and/or &quot;provably&quot; dangerous.
<P>
7.State laws should also allow for consideration of past history
in making determinations about involuntary commitment and/or court
ordered treatment, since past history is often a reliable way
to anticipate the future course of illness.
<P>
8. An independent administrative and/or judicial review must be
guaranteed in all involuntary commitment and/or court ordered
treatment determinations.  Individuals must be afforded access
to appropriate representation knowledgeable about biological brain
disorders and provided opportunities to submit evidence in opposition
to involuntary commitment and/or court ordered treatment.
<P>
9.Responsibility for determining court ordered treatment should
always be vested with medical professionals, who, in conjunction
with the individual, family and other interested parties, must
develop a plan for treatment.    
<P>
10 The legal standard for states to meet in order to justify emergency
commitments for initial 24 to 72 hours should be &quot;information
and belief&quot;.  For involuntary commitments beyond the initial
period, the standard should be &quot;clear and convincing evidence.&quot;
 Involuntary commitments and/or court ordered treatment must be
periodically subject to administrative or judicial review to ascertain
whether circumstances justify the continuation of these orders.
<P>
11. Court ordered outpatient treatment should be considered as
a less restrictive, more beneficial, and less costly treatment
alternative to involuntary inpatient treatment.
<P>
12. Efforts must be undertaken to better educate justice systems
and law enforcement professionals about the relationship between
severe biological brain disorders and the application of involuntary
inpatient and outpatient commitment and court ordered treatment.
<P>
13. Private and public health insurance plans must cover the costs
of involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and/or court
ordered treatment.
