                <td>The healthcare delivery system's single
                constant seems to be change. Drastic changes are
                being observed in financial reimbursement
                patterns, process improvement strategies,
                information systems, and regulations. Nursing
                care remains an essential focus, and improving
                patient satisfaction, loyalty, and the level of
                &quot;repeat business,&quot; is becoming
                increasingly critical to each healthcare
                organization's mission. <p>Patient-focused care
                (PFC) is one of the newer approaches to
                healthcare delivery which has arisen out of the
                realm of re-engineering. Several of its basic
                tenets include defining the patient as the center
                of all activity, and providing care as
                conveniently as possible for the patient (e.g.,
                at the bedside). As part of PFC, careful
                examination is conducted of all functional
                aspects of the care delivery system. This
                examination is intended to maximize each team
                member's contributions, and concurrently improve
                the continuity and quality of care. Standardized
                &quot;care paths&quot; are also used to assist in
                workload planning and as clinical treatment
                guidelines. </p>
                <p>During the transition from a more traditional
                delivery system to a PFC model, modification of
                an organization's administrative structure is
                often indicated. For instance, by reducing the
                number of levels of command, more timely
                decision-making and expanded scope of
                responsibility at each level is promoted. Within
                each functional department, specific clinical and
                non-clinical functions are examined, with a focus
                on determining the level of staff most
                appropriate to perform each task. Technical tasks
                are closely analyzed: &quot;Can an unlicensed
                person safely perform task X, or is a licensed or
                professional's skill required?&quot; Basic
                personal care and other support functions are
                also reviewed, with the goal of reducing
                professionals' time spent on basic tasks, to free
                up time for more complex or high-risk tasks. </p>
                <p>As administrators and nursing executives study
                the PFC concept or initiate transition to this
                care model, it is important to consider and
                address the potential risks associated with this
                type of change. Outlined below are several key
                risk management issues for consideration. </p>

                Central to PFC is task analysis. As each specific
                function or task is examined, with the question
                of which level of employee is appropriate to do
                this task, these questions should be addressed:
                What technical skills are required and how does
                one gain proficiency in those skills? Is
                on-the-job training sufficient, or is a formal
                program needed? What level of clinical judgment
                is required? Based on the potential adverse
                outcomes of the task, is a high level of clinical
                judgment needed in order to recognize and/or to
                respond to such outcomes? For example, feeding a
                person with dysphagia poses a risk of aspiration;
                would a patient tech or a nurse be better
                prepared to handle such a task, or does it depend
                on the type of patient? Do any applicable local,
                state, or federal regulations address the subject
                at hand? Each jurisdiction has various
                regulations pertaining to the practice of
                healthcare professionals, such as the Nurse
                Practice Act. These outline the scope of practice
                permitted for qualified professionals in each
                professional category (M.D., P.A., N.P., R.N.,
                LPN, P.T., O.T., CRNA, CNM, etc.). The regulatory
                boards also respond to specific questions from
                facilities: inquiries regarding whether a
                function is restricted to a specific professional
                category are often addressed by the pertinent
                regulatory authority(s). What positions do the
                professional associations hold regarding the
                issue under review? Many professional
                organizations are assembling data and/or offering
                guidance to their affiliate members regarding
                establishing the respective boundaries for
                licensed versus unlicensed assistive personnel
                (example: The Association of Operating Room
                Nurses has published a book on the role of
                assistive personnel). Knowledge of and reference
                to any pertinent position statements is
                essential. If an aspect of PFC is implemented
                which is at odds with a specific professional
                association's stance, this could become a
                significant focus of attention in the event of a
                malpractice claim. </td>

                In a malpractice case, one of the four elements a
                plaintiff must prove is that the defendant
                deviated from the recognized professional
                standard of care. Expert testimony,
                policies/procedures, and national guidelines are
                elements which are used to establish the standard
                of care in a particular case. If a facility
                allows a technical staff member to do a specific
                patient task, and a majority of other hospitals
                requires that function to be performed by an
                R.N., a dispute could arise as to the recognized
                standard of care. </td>

                participation in the training should be obtained
                from the recognized experts. A formal written

                objective competency assessment component
                (written post-test, with a demonstration of
                proficiency). Depending on the function, and its

                formalized occurrence monitoring system. A

                From a proactive risk prevention point of view,
                it will be in an organization's best interest to
                carefully address the above issues during a
                transition to PFC. Abruptly transitioning a task
                from one staff category to another simply to
                reduce salary expenses could result in major
                malpractice exposure, if not handled effectively.
                <p>This article has outlined several important
                issues which warrant consideration when a
                facility is planning a transition from a
                traditional model to PFC, a new mode for care
                delivery which involves task reassignment. The
                cost advantages of expanding the role of
                assistive personnel, versus the use of more
                expensive professional staff, could quite easily
                be lost if the change results in disgruntled
                staff and an increase in malpractice claims. </p>
