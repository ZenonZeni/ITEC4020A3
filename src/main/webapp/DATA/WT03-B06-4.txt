All-out collaboration: Australia and Malaysia edge towards a more
integrated partnership

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 59

MALAYSIA AND Australia are strengthening their ties in the fields of
business, education, science, the arts and sports. That was the message
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer delivered in his
recent visit to Malaysia.
  The minister also said that the tide of economic, technological and
social change which is transforming Australia has created further
opportunities for cooperation and partnership between the two countries.
  In a written reply to questions from Malaysian Business, Downer spells
out the framework for trade and economic relations between the two
countries, and what possibly lies in the future.  
How do you see future growth in trade between Australia and Malaysia?
  Clearly, we would like our trade with Malaysia to increase strongly
every year. Over the past five years, total two-way trade has grown at
just on 19 per cent - a trend I would like to see continue.
  However, as we form more integrated partnerships with Malaysia and
Malaysians, it is likely that we will invest and establish more commercial
operations in each other's markets. This may mean that there will be a
shift in the way business is undertaken in future. There might be a
stronger growth in the bilateral investment statistics at first, hopefully
leading to a steady and balanced growth in trade statistics. Greater
investment should in turn engender healthier trade flows too.  
Would you be able to specify the amount of foreign direct investment
flowing from Australia into Malaysia?
  It is very difficult to specify the exact amount of Australian
investment going into Malaysia. Official figures do not take into account
funds sourced outside the investing country, re-investment of profits,
appreciation of assets and a number of other factors. So the figures are
generally underestimates - sometimes by a long shot. Nevertheless,
Australian official data puts the level of Australian direct investment in
Malaysia at around A$2.1 billion (RM4.24 billion), as at June 1994.
  However, I think this is an underestimate of the true stock of
Australian investment in Malaysia. Malaysia and Australia are both long
standing investors in each other's economies, and the total stock of
investment in each direction probably amounts to several billion dollars.
  Over the last few years, the pace of Malaysian investment in Australia
has also accelerated significantly. Some of your bigger and more
successful groups are here. Apart from the earlier, and successful,
Malaysian investors such as IGB Bhd and Malaysia Mining Corporation, we
are now seeing newer players like the Berjaya Group entering the market in
fields such as medical services and technology.  
What are the major Malaysian sectors in which Australian companies are
involved?
  Australian companies are involved in commercial operations and projects
right across the Malaysian economy. Australian investment has largely been
concentrated in the textile and textile products, non-metallic mineral
products, rubber, electrical and electronic and fabricated products
industries. Already some 200 Australian companies have offices in
Malaysia.
  Significant new Australian investments are expected to be approved in
the food processing, building products and paper manufacturing industries.
The information technology, computing and multimedia fields are also very
exciting.  
Given Malaysia's current push for technology intensive industries, there
must be plenty of opportunities for Australians. Please comment.
  This is one of the most exciting areas. We really want to help build
partnerships in technology, and Malaysia's focus on `Smart Partnerships'
in the technology sector will put the onus on businesses to be creative,
innovative and highly cooperative in their approach, and to include a
practical focus on training and human resource development.  
How does Malaysia compare with other countries in the Asia Pacific
region in terms of investment incentives?
  I am really no expert on the comparative investment incentive schemes
around the East Asian region. It is obviously a very competitive
environment. But my overall assessment is that more important than
specific incentives schemes for this or that industry or specific tax
breaks, is the need to get the overall economic and investment environment
right.
  That means setting a long term strategic vision and sticking with it,
getting the long term macro economic settings right and of course,
underlying all of this, stable and clear sighted political leadership. In
this environment, businesses can invest long term, build their assets and
expand their markets. I think that Malaysia has achieved its standing as a
very attractive investment destination because it has got these
fundamentals right. Vision 2020 sets a clear goal. Macro economic settings
have been carefully set and prudently managed and the country is
politically stable.
  So I think it is the fundamentals which are the source of success. Of
course, there are a number of other East and Southeast Asian countries
which have also advanced by attending carefully to these fundamentals -
but I think Malaysia stands out in the first rank of these.  
What investment opportunities are there in Australia for Malaysian
businesses?
  As I said before, we would like to encourage more Malaysian businesses
to invest in the productive, export and job-generating sectors of the
Australian economy - and I think we see good signs that this is already
starting to happen.
  Traditionally, we have had a good flow of investment into property
development and into mining. But now we are seeing interest in investment
in shipbuilding, medical services and technology, solar heating, building
products and aircraft engineering and technology.
  We want to see more of this kind of investment. Australian firms are
very innovative - having developed or adapted technologies to make them
suitable for Australian conditions. Now many of them are looking to go off
shore. They want to expand their markets. Foreign equity participation can
provide the finance and market openings to make this happen. And in
return, there will be technology transfer benefits for the foreign partner
and its affiliates.  
Are there going to be any changes in Government policy which will either
make it easier or more difficult for Malaysians to invest in Australia?
  My view is that government works best when it supports people and
business rather than tying them down in regulation and bureaucracy. The
best contribution the government can make is to lay down sound macro and
micro economic policies which create conditions for business to thrive. In
that context, the government's agenda is to free up the Australian economy
and create a strong climate, conducive to investor confidence.
  We want to make it easier for both local and foreign companies to invest
in this country's future. On the macroeconomic front, our first priority
has been to get the budget in order. We have cut A$3.9 billion (RM7.87
billion) from the underlying public sector deficit in this financial year
and we will cut A$7.2 billion (RM14.54 billion) by 1997-1998, bringing the
budget into underlying surplus in 1998-1999. This will reduce pressure on
the markets, reduce the cost of finance and encourage private investment.  
How would you describe Malaysia-Australia relations, particularly
economic ties?
  The bilateral relationship is very good and getting better -
particularly in the economic and commercial field and at the political
level which is very important. The priority this government has put into
the relationship is attested to by the energy with which we have sought to
establish relationships with our Malaysian counterparts. The bilateral
relationship is underpinned by very strong people-to-people links -
alumni, business people - and it is my job to ensure we do not take these
linkages for granted, that we build on them pro-actively to advance our
shared interests.
  The Australian government greatly appreciated Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad's first meeting with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
This was a tremendous basis upon which to establish relations between the
two governments.
  We have had an impressive flow of ministerial visits in both directions.
I have been to Malaysia myself twice since this government came to office
and many of my colleagues have also visited Malaysia. Deputy Prime
Minister and Trade Minister, Tim Fischer has met with  Datuk Seri Rafidah
Aziz on five occasions since March this year. So we are achieving a good
close working relationship in areas of central importance. We want to
build friendship and trust.  
Are there any areas in which you hope to expand further?
  Definitely. We would clearly like to see more expansion of people-to-
people ties at all levels from science and technology collaboration to
sport, in small business development and in new areas of existing
cooperation such as in education and training.
  My perception is that business and commercial opportunities in this
region usually follow the informal paths, the networks of friendship
established directly between people. So we need to build on those.
  Now, more than ever before, the growth of cheaper international
telecommunications, the Internet, expanded frequency and lower cost of air
travel are making the formation and maintenance of these kinds of networks
all the more easy.  
There have been reports that Australia's new government is rather cool
on the issue of integration with Asia as compared with the previous
government. Please comment.
  The government is strongly committed to building relations with Asia as
our highest foreign priority. For that reason, I and my ministerial
colleague the Minister of Trade, Tim Fischer, have travelled extensively
and frequently in Asia since we took office. The Prime Minister, Howard,
made his first major bilateral visits to Indonesia and Japan. The focus of
our diplomatic activity, our commitment and our travel continues to be
within our region. To put it simply, Australia's commitment to the region
is unshakeable. There can be no questioning of our commitment or interest
in building our Asian relationships. Our relationships with Asia embody
our key national interests as a country both now and in the future. We are
committed to the active pursuit of those interests.

No basis to rumours: Executive director Khaw Chay Tee sets the record
straight

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 10

DATUK LIM Thian Kiat, or better known as T K Lim, has a reputation for
being reclusive and press-shy. Thus, it came as no surprise when the
taipan of Multi-Purpose Holdings, Kamunting, Magnum and a host of other
listed companies turned down a request for a Malaysian Business interview.
  However, he directed his lieutenant, MPHB executive director and lawyer
Khaw Chay Tee, to reply to a set of questions on his behalf. Below, we
reprint the replies:
  It was reported some time back that you will be teaming up with Hong
Leong in a Philippine lottery venture. What is the status of this venture?
Have you mended fences with Quek Leng Chan of Hong Leong?
  There is no proposal for the Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group to team up
with the  Hong Leong Group in any Philippine lottery venture. As for our
relationship with the Hong Leong Group, it has always been and is a
cordial and friendly one.
  It was rumoured that Multi-Purpose Capital (M Capital) will be making a
reverse takeover of a second board company. Or is this an attempt to list
Multi-Purpose Bank?
  There is no proposal for M Capital to undertake a reverse takeover of
any listed company.
  There are also currently no firm plans to list Multi-Purpose Bank as the
management is concentrating its efforts on achieving Tier-1 status for the
bank under the two-tier regulatory system as soon as possible.
  Are you planning any more gaming ventures in China?
  The Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group has no plans for any more gaming
ventures in China.
  It is felt that Bandar Raya Development's prospects are bleak as its
landbank is being depleted. Will you be buying up more land?
  Bandar Raya Developments has over the last few years recorded average
profit growth exceeding 25 per cent per annum and the management of Bandar
Raya is confident of being in the position to maintain this trend. It
currently has an existing landbank exceeding 1,100 acres, the bulk of
which is located strategically in the Klang Valley and Johor, which is
more than sufficient to sustain Bandar Raya's requirements for the next
few years. Bandar Raya has, of course, identified existing as well as what
it believes will be new growth areas for property development and shall be
replenishing its landbank when the opportunity arises.
  There is speculation that MPHB will divest its stake in Sarawak
Enterprise Corporation Bhd. Is this true?
  MPHB has no intention of doing so as we believe Sarawak Enterprise as
well as the state of Sarawak hold tremendous potential.
  Four years ago, you told Malaysian Business you would be concentrating
on property and gaming, leisure and finance. Now, with the addition of
Sarawak Enterprise, you are also into power generation and various other
Sarawak-linked activities. What are the divisions that you will be
concentrating on from now on?
  Since 1991, the MPHB Group has had three core businesses, namely
financial services, property and gaming. The group has over the last four
years developed and grown this into the profitable and stable businesses
which you see today. The MPHB Group was therefore in the position, at the
end of 1995, to take on the challenge of an additional core business in
the form of electricity generation, transmission and distribution through
Sarawak Enterprise. The group intends to devote a similar amount of time
and effort to its new core business as it does to its existing core
businesses.
  Kamunting Corporation Bhd's (KCB) Kepong toll concession has been the
subject of controversy. How stable would earnings be if the concession is
withdrawn?
  Kamunting does not view its toll concession as controversial. The Kepong
toll concession was legally extended by the government for an additional
seven years, that is, from 8 Jan 1996 to 7 Jan 2003. The legality of the
extension has been publicly reconfirmed on a number of occasions by both
the Minister for Works as well as by the Deputy Minister for Works. As
Kamunting has at all times complied with and fulfilled its obligations
under the Kepong toll concession, there are really no grounds for any
controversy.

Bug-busting its way to the top: Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd isn't content with
being just the market leader i

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 24

IT MAY SOUND odd, but Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd is one company which is happy
about what is a bane of most households - blood-thirsty mosquitoes and
bothersome insects. And little wonder, for the revenue of this soon-to-be-
listed company is derived from our strong aversion to the buzz and bites,
disease and destruction of these pesky winged creatures.
  Fumakilla manufactures mosquito coils, insecticide vapourising mats and
insecticide aerosol sprays. But the manufacture and sale of mosquito
coils, which make up 80 per cent of Fumakilla's sales turnover is clearly
its speciality. The remaining 20 per cent of sales comes from Fumakilla's
vape mats (10 per cent) and aerosol sprays (10 per cent).
  The company's mosquito coils enjoy a market share of 65 per cent in
Malaysia, and its total sales have grown from RM28 million in 1990 to RM78
million in 1995. The Fumakilla plant at the Prai Industrial Park, Penang,
churns out over 800,000 cartons of 1,000 coils and 100,000 cartons of
1,000 units of vape mats and aerosol sprays a year.
  Fumakilla's president and executive chairman, Datuk Fumihiko Konishi,
says Fumakilla intends to increase the Prai plant's production capacity to
1.6 million cartons a year in five years' time.
  Konishi elaborates, `It does not involve expanding the premises of the
plant or establishing a new one. It is an attempt to reduce the workforce
by using technology.' This automation programme, says Konishi, is a
gradual one which is going to take five years and a significant amount of
investment. Upon completion, it will reduce Fumakilla's staff by half.
  Currently, 25 per cent of Fumakilla's workforce are Bangladeshis. The
company aims to reduce their numbers by not renewing their permits. The
reason? `To reduce cost - we seem to spend more because we have to provide
them with accommodation and transportation plus an annual paid trip back
home as well as uniforms and recreational facilities,' says Konishi.
`Also, if for some reason Bangladeshis have to return to their country,
then our company will be paralysed.
  `Besides, the acute labour shortage in Malaysia will persist. Population
growth cannot catch up with the growth of the industries of this country.
The only way is to introduce automation.' Automation will utilise the same
space as the existing premises. Says Konishi, `Our 7.2 acres will not be
increased. And if we fully automate, then we should be able to double our
capacity.'
  Konishi isn't content with Fumakilla being the market leader in
Malaysia. He has set his eyes on making the company one of Southeast
Asia's insecticide giants. `In 10 years time, I will be talking not about
Fumakilla's Malaysian market share but about its Asean market share. The
total population of the Asean market will reach 500 million by the year
2000. It represents an enormous market,' says a confident Kohishi.
  According to the Fumakilla president, the stage has been set for the
penetration of this regional market. Over 20 per cent of the 800 million
mosquito coils churned out by Fumakilla's Prai plant is exported, mostly
to Asean-member countries. He explains,' `The exports go to Thailand,
where we have captured a 15 per cent market share. I forecast this to
increase to 20 per cent by 1997. Other export destinations are South Korea
where Fumakilla has a 20 per cent market share, and Hong Kong and
Singapore, with smaller market shares.'
  Outside Malaysia, Vietnam is Fumakilla's biggest market, having captured
30 per cent of its market. So much so that Fumakilla set up a
manufacturing facility in the Dong Nai province of Vietnam at a cost of
RM8 million. Production began in December 1995 with a capacity of 200,000
cartons of mosquito coils per year. The capacity is to be doubled by the
end of the year, and this will involve an investment of about RM2.1
million.
  The next step, says Konishi, is to set up a manufacturing facility in
Myanmar next year. `Although we have begun to supply our mosquito coils to
Myanmar from our Penang plant this year, there has been a serious
logistical problem - their ports are congested. Hence, a better way to
penetrate the Myanmar market is to manufacture the coils in the country.
Furthermore, there is an abundant and cheap supply of labour there,' says
Konishi.
  Konishi says Fumakilla's mosquito coils, marketed under the brand names
Fumakilla, Goldfish and Jumbo, have an edge over competitors because they
have a higher content of an active ingredient called d-allethrin. Both
insecticide mats and coils when heated release the d-allethrin chemical
which destroys insects such as mosquitoes. Claims Konishi, `Our product is
50 per cent more effective than the other brands.' He explains why. `We
use 0.3 per cent of this ingredient in every coil while the common
practice among players in the industry is to use only 0.2 per cent.'
  Since d-allethrin costs RM500 per kilogramme, a higher concentration of
the ingredient drives costs up. As a result, Fumakilla's mosquito coils
are priced 20 per cent higher than other brands in the market. But this
does not worry the company. `We reckon our customers will be loyal, and
this is also why we project our sales to grow,' says Konishi. He expects
Fumakilla's market for mosquito coils in Malaysia to increase annually by
four per cent or less in the future.
  Konishi also says Fumakilla takes its research and development
seriously. Its analytical and biological laboratory which focuses on
research into insecticide is the only one of its kind in Asia outside
Japan.
  `In terms of product development, our laboratory comes up with products
that are more effective than our competitors. We have so far invested RM5
million in our R&D facility. In 10 years, we hope to invest at least five
per cent of our sales turnover into R&D,' says Konishi.
  Surprisingly, Fumakilla in Malaysia was not set up to manufacture
mosquito coils, but to import insecticide mats. Established in 1976, the
company started by supplying vape mats made by Fumakilla Japan Ltd - the
inventors of the electronic insecticide device.
  Konishi, a trained chemist from Japan, did not begin his career with
Fumakilla. He spent four years with a Singaporean trading company, leaving
his post as head of its chemical department in 1973 to venture into Penang
to establish Texchem (M) Trading Sdn Bhd (now known as Texchem Resources
Bhd). Among other things, Texchem trades in chemical products. Konishi
also set up a manufacturing company, Texchem (M) Sdn Bhd, which began
production of industrial chemicals in 1976.
  That same year, Konishi decided to get into the insecticide business
with Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Fumakilla Ltd whose majority
shareholders, the Oshimo family, were family friends. With the assistance
of the Oshimos, Fumihiko incorporated Fumakilla (M) Sdn Bhd in Malaysia on
Dec 29, 1976 to manufacture vape mats. It was converted into a public
company on April 1983.
  However, Konishi says he had a hard time convincing the public to buy an
insecticide which did not produce smoke. `It takes a long time before
people will be comfortable using vape mats which do not produce any smoke
but which are just as effective as mosquito coils. Even in Japan, where
mosquito coils and insecticide mats originated, it took 30 years for the
sale of the mats to rival that of coils,' he says.
  Konishi feels the mosquito coil market is not about to shrink. `Even in
the year 2005, which will be 30 years after the introduction of vape mats
here, I don't think the usage of vape mats would be equivalent to the use
of mosquito coils. This is because of factors such as our lifestyle and
the structure of houses and rooms,' says Konishi.
  Fumakilla's listing exercise on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange involves an offer for sale of six million shares at RM3.20
each. Fumakilla has a paid-up capital of RM39.99 million and is
forecasting a pre-tax profit of RM10.943 million on a turnover of RM87.38
million for the year ending Dec 31, 1996. This will give Fumakilla a gross
earnings per share of around 27 sen.
  Thus, at its offer price of RM3.20, its shares are being offered at a
prospective gross price earnings (PE) multiple of 11.8 times. According to
analysts, the consumer products sectoral PE multiple is 21.6 times. Based
on this PE, Fumakilla would probably trade at above RM5.80.

Choices in education: The stage is being set for greater interaction with
Australian edu

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 62

IN THE FIELD of higher education, Australia rates among one of the premier
destinations for Malaysian students wanting to study overseas. Last year,
of the 60,980 local students who went abroad for their tertiary education,
21 per cent chose Australia.
  Australian ties to Malaysia in the field of education date back to the
1950s when `The Lucky Country' was a key participant in the Colombo Plan
which provided education to developing nations of the British
Commonwealth.
  More than half of the average 12,000 Malaysian students admitted into
Australian institutions annually study business-and-economics-related
subjects, while almost a quarter study science and technology-related
subjects, including engineering.
  They study at the more than 300 schools, Technical and Further Education
(Tafe) colleges, specialist colleges and universities spread over
Australia's vast continent.
  But things may change in the near future, and the number of Malaysian
students abroad may fall.
  The reason? About RM2.5 billion leaves Malaysia annually as a result of
Malaysians studying abroad, contributing to the country's large services
deficit. Government authorities are keen to see Malaysia becoming a
regional centre of excellence in education by the year 2020. To help the
Malaysian higher education sector expand, legislation has been tabled to
allow private universities to be established, including the setting up of
branch campuses of foreign universities.
  Interviewed by Malaysian Business, Senator Amanda Vanstone, Australia's
Minister for Employment, Education Training and Youth Affairs, says such a
move is welcomed by Australia as it is in line with Australia's plans for
its education sector.
  Malaysia and Australia, she says, are at the start of a new phase of a
three-stage relationship in education. Says Vanstone, `The first phase
started with the Colombo Plan which saw a small but growing number of
Malaysian and other Commonwealth students going to Australia for their
studies. The second phase was one where there was a big push, with
industry and other private sector interests driving large numbers of
Malaysian students to come to Australia. We think both these phases have
been beneficial to us and, we hope, for Malaysia as well.
  `We are now starting on the third phase, where rather than a one way
flow of students from Malaysia to us, we want to step up the interaction
quite dramatically with things like twinning arrangements, where the
institutions, the academics and researchers will work much more closely
together. This two-way flow of students is a much more dynamic and
exciting relationship than the other two and we wish to emphasise that we
are very keen on building this third phase and pushing it as far as we
can.'
  Vanstone says it won't be long before the number of Australians coming
to Malaysia to study increases, but `perhaps not for full degrees in the
beginning ... just doing semesters up here with twinned institutions'.
  In all likelihood, there will be a drop in the number of Malaysians
wanting to study in Australia. `Things change,' says Vanstone. `I was here
about eight years ago but now, I hardly recognise Kuala Lumpur. The world
is never going to stop changing and we have to learn to move with it. We
are grateful for the opportunities we have had in having a lot of
Malaysian students. Now, we want to work with you on the next phase of
what you want and what we want.'
  In a related development, the Australian government recently announced
its intention of making some substantial savings from the higher education
sector. Vanstone says that as a result of this, Australian universities
will face only a very small reduction in their operating grant. The
reduction is against a growth estimate, adding that the universities will
have more operating grants next year than they had this year, but it will
be a little less than expected. `The big savings we are making does not
come from cutting grants to universities but from increasing the
contributions from Australian university students,' she says.
  Australia has a system of contribution called the Higher Education
Contribution scheme (HECS), introduced by the previous Labour government.
Under this scheme, students can go to university irrespective of the
wealth of their family but the moment they begin to earn wages, they have
to make contributions. However, Vanstone says the present government
intends to make this system of contribution more equitable.
  She explains, `The previous HECS system was one where irrespective of
whether you were a teacher, a doctor or a veterinary science student, the
contribution you were required to make was the same. We think that is
unfair and we are shifting to three levels of contribution where doctors,
veterinary science graduates and lawyers will be in the highest level;
engineering, general science and commerce students in the middle level and
nursing and art students as well as teachers in the lowest level.'
  In relation to the cut in operating grants for universities, Vanstone
says that universities will be allowed to `drop load', that is, to drop
student numbers in the post-graduate course work area. `We want to
increase the numbers in the undergraduate area. We plan to fund 5,000 more
students nationally for undergraduate courses but they are at universities
that will be allowed to drop post-graduate course work-loads such as MBAs.
This means that the total government funding per student will remain
pretty much the same,' Vanstone says.
  Recently however, Australia's reputation as a welcoming country took a
hard knock, no thanks to Australian independent Member of Parliament,
Pauline Hanson. In her maiden speech in Parliament, Hanson blamed Asians
and Aborigines for economic and social problems in the country and linked
Asian citizens to crime and drug problems. As a result, prospective
students are uneasy over their future in Australia. Vanstone took the
opportunity to address the issue, describing Hanson as a renegade and
`maverick' member of parliament and also describing as unfortunate, the
attention given Hanson by the media.
  She says, `It is important to note that when the (Australian) Prime
Minister first heard Hanson's remarks, his instructions were that she
could not stand for Parliament as a Liberal, that those remarks were
inconsistent with Liberal philosophy and hence it was simply not possible
for her to stand under the Liberal banner. She, therefore, stood for
parliament as an Independent and has expressed views which are repugnant
to the government, that are not the government's views.
  `They are certainly not my views. Australia has been a very welcoming
country and it still is. Our door is always open. We feel we have got
enormous benefits from the international students who have come. We look
forward to that continuing and increasing and at the same time, working on
a two-way development with Malaysia and increasing the strength of our
relationship,' she says.

Contractual benefits: Students gain in several ways from the twinning of
the Sepang Institute

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 68

THERE IS ONE simple reason why the Sepang Institute Of Technology (SIT)
chooses to have a twinning programme with the University Of Adelaide (UOA)
- the high standard and reputation of Australia's third oldest university
which ranks among that country's top six.
  SIT chief executive officer Dr Paul Chan says UOA became the obvious
choice as a twinning partner because it is considered as the Oxbridge of
Australia and is highly regarded internationally. `This university has
Noble prize winners (3) and very brilliant staff, Rhodes Scholars among
them. It is not a very huge university but it definitely has won many
awards - recently, Professor Allen Kerr was the winner of the inaugural
Australia Prize and Professor Paul Davis was awarded the Templeton Prize,
previously won by Alexander Solzhenistsyn and Mother Teresa.
  `Students there are well rounded and the entrance requirement is
befitting that of a good university. It is also very proud of its
tradition. The alumni of UOA comprise some of the top people in Singapore
and Malaysia,' says Chan.
  UOA first came to Malaysia in 1994 when SIT was run by the Hong Leong
Group. Director of the SIT-UOA twinning programme and visiting professor
Dr Thomas Kurucsev says, `When the Lion Group bought over the Institute,
we became their twinning partner. Our first intake was early this year,
and 250 students are enrolled in the twinning programme. We hope to
increase the number of students to between 400 and 450 for the second
year. In three to four years, we want to have at least 650 to 700 students
in the twinning pro-gramme.'
  Kurucsev adds, `SIT's scholastic year for the Australian programme is
synchronised with UOA and students sit for the examinations at the same
time as undergraduates in Adelaide.'
  UOA offers SIT students various engineering courses leading to a honours
degree. The other courses offered at SIT are Bachelor of Economics,
Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Science
(Maths and Computer Science). The engineering courses run for four years,
which means students will have to be at SIT for two years before going to
UOA for another two years. The same applies for the other four-year
courses. For the three year courses, students are required to be at SIT
for one year and another two at UOA.
  SIT is the only college in Malaysia with the largest number of
academicians holding PhDs (20) and masters degrees (20), many from
prestigious universities like Harvard, Oxford, London, Toronto, Illinois,
Australian National and Adelaide.
  Kurucsev says SIT-UOA has a strict quality control on courses and this
is achieved several ways, including having a full-time academic director
for the project. SIT has provided a considerable budget which allows
Australian lecturers to come at regular intervals for each subject. The
duration for each subject is between a week and 10 days.
  Apparently, by coming over to Malaysia, the Australians get an
opportunity to give tutorials where they can meet and talk to students
about their courses. `For each semester, there should be two visits per
subject. There should be 20 visits per semester from lecturers from UOA
and that is an absolute minimum,' says Kurucsev.
  According to him, under the agreement, SIT is not allowed to have
another twinning programme with any other Australian university and the
same applies to UOA which cannot have a similar programme with another
local institute.
  Established in 1874, UOA has over 13,000 students, including more than
1,000 international students. The first official ranking of Australian
Universities by the Australian government's Committee for Quality
Assurance in Higher Education in 1995 has confirmed again that UOA is one
of the universities in the top band of institutions in Australia.

Crest and trenergy to tie up?

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

SOMETHING seems to be brewing between second boarders Crest Petroleum Sdn
Bhd and Trenergy (M) Bhd.
  Earwitness understands that Crest (formerly T H Loy) is negotiating to
acquire a stake in Trenergy for an undisclosed sum. It is, however, not
likely to be a controlling stake.
  Industry sources say a tie-up between both companies will not come as a
surprise as both are involved in the oil and gas industry.
  Recently, Trenergy director Chee Peck Kiat was reported to have disposed
of his 20 per cent stake in the company. It was not known who the buyer
was.
  Crest, which has a paid-up capital of RM75.78 million, is a member of
the Renong Group. It jointly owns substantial oil reserves, estimated at
110 million barrels, in Sumatra, Indonesia with Petramina and Petronusa.
  Trenergy is headed by Salehuddin Hashim, believed to be a close friend
of Renong chieftain Tan Sri Halim Saad.
  The sources also do not discount the possibility of Crest and Trenergy
collaborating in a technical tie-up.

Crystal clear directions: Construction company Crystal Realty is quite sure
it is ready to take on

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 30

KUCHING-BASED construction firm Crystal Realty Group Bhd may be
comparatively young but within seven years it has garnered enough jobs to
put it well within the top league in its field in rapidly growing Sarawak.
  Formed by two Foochow brothers, Ting Kie Hung, 36, and Ting Bing Cheong,
34, `CR', as the company is known, started in 1989. Among its first jobs
was the RM2.4 million sub-contract to build the Sarawak United People's
Party (SUPP) headquarters in Jalan Tan Sri Ong Kee Hui, Kuching.
  The project was completed well on schedule. Recalls Bing Cheong, a civil
and structural engineer by training, `I literally worked and lived at the
work-site for the duration of the contract period.' He says that for a
year, the oversized container office was his office and living quarters.
  That project was perhaps the most important break the brothers received
after branching off on their own - they had previously worked for their
father Ting Ong Hua who owned Sibu-based Soon Hup Construction Company -
to enter the Kuching market. `We've been kept very busy ever since,' says
Bing Cheong, the group's managing director.
  CR's executive director Huon Chek Khing, 29, shows a list of completed
projects todate valued at about RM133 million and another list of projects
in progress valued at about RM360 million. `We specialise in building
construction, more so now in high-rise buildings,' he says. `The high-rise
buildings under construction include the Tun Jugah Centre, Wisma Bersatul,
Wisma Crystal and Rumah Dayak - all in Kuching.'
  Huon adds that while general and building construction remains the
group's core business, CR has diversified into property development,
property management, mechanical and engineering services, building-related
materials manufacturing, trading and specialised foundation jobs.
  `We're the first Sarawak-based construction group to venture into bore
foundation works. Examples are the Custodev's Twin Tower Block in Rock
Road, the Tun Jugah Centre in Padungan and the MBf building in Jalan
Satok. But that's not all CR is into. It is also the first Kuching-based
company to manufacture non-baked bricks, besides reinforced pre-cast
concrete or ready-mix concrete, under Crystal Concrete Sdn Bhd.
  `Our aim is to be a self-sufficient construction firm by becoming
involved in manufacturing, trading and marketing. All of them complement
our core business. In other words, we want to grow and expand.'
  This interview took place at what Bing Cheong describes as CR's
temporary office on the third floor of Crystal Cineplex Complex in Taman
Satria Jaya, Kuching, pending the completion next year of CR's RM20
million 13-storey corporate headquarters at Jalan Rambutan/Jalan Nanas.
  The group's logo `CR' is in two colours - `C' which is red is usually
associated with prosperity in the Chinese culture, while `R' is blue,
symbolising the sky that is unlimited, like its slogan `Together, We
Build'. A corporate image is strictly maintained - everyone from boss down
to the office boy wears a blue uniform at work. The group also allocates
funds for staff training.
  Not only is the company young but the people managing and working in it
are mostly in their early thirties. With so many projects on hand, the
workforce has increased as well. `Our total staff today is 280, including
50  engineers and managers,' says Bing Cheong.
  CR feels it has marshalled enough experience, expertise and know-how to
attempt bigger things, especially major infra-structural works. It is
undaunted by the competition from the `big boys'.
  With a growing turnover (refer to chart), CR will definitely play a big
role in Sarawak's construction sector in the years to come. According to
Bing Cheong, turnover for 1996 is estimated at about RM75 million, nearly
double that of 1995, which itself is twice that of the previous year.
  `We've got a lot of opportunities here with the Bakun HEP, foreign
investments, mega projects, etc, that will entail a total development
expenditure of some RM75 billion within the next 10 years. There is a
provision of RM1.8 billion alone for infra-structural development for
Sarawak under the Seventh Malaysia Plan. So I think we can share a bit of
the cake,' says Bing Cheong.
  The managing director believes that CR has been in the market
sufficiently long enough to prove its capacity and capability. Its edge
over many others, he claims, lies in having the latest technology in
construction `like the bore piling' and RM25 million worth of construction
equipment ranging from excavators to  cranes and bore piling machines.
  In a competitive environment, every company has to have some kind of an
edge. And the way to achieve that is to synergise people and resources and
keep costs down. Diversifying from its present core business into the
various related activities is part of the long-term strategy.
  Bing Cheong says CR is studying the possibility of getting listed on the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's second board. Like many other Sarawak
contractors, CR sees listing as perhaps the best way to raise the
necessary capital and take advantage of opportunities from the billion-
ringgit projects in Sarawak in the next 10 years.

Detecting deceit: Some of the ways employees can cheat a company

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 77

MUCH OF OUR work derives from negative events such as stock differences,
indications of fraud or theft, or the leaking of business information. The
tip-off usually comes from someone inside or outside the company, but
often the management hesitates to act on it.
  Denying the problem is no solution. No matter how unpleasant, the
question as to whether something is wrong or not must be answered as the
uncertainty in the long run can be extremely undermining. An investigation
brings clarity, certainty and an end to anxiety and problems.
  Outlined below are some cases where the management has heeded the
signals that demanded action.THE HARD WORKER
  Doubts and suspicions are difficult to work with. That is why a client
wanted us to carry out an investigation into rumours that an employee was
changing car tyres free of charge.
  The rumours did not seem plausible because the employee had been with
the firm for 10 years and, moreover, was a hard worker. But still,
certainty is always better, especially if an innocent person is being
falsely accused.
  The employee was a one-man business inside the firm. He was responsible
for the guarantee work. If there were problems with the tyres delivered,
he assessed the complaint, wrote out the guarantee ticket, fetched new
tyres from the stores and fitted them. No one checked his work. He was a
hard worker who would even work during break times to help a client.
  In reality, he made good use of the fact that everyone else was in the
canteen so that he could arrange his little deals with the clients, who
did not arrive at break time by chance. Our investigation revealed that he
had a number of other little deals which had nothing to do with the firm
but which he conducted during working hours.
  The firm is now an employee the poorer but financially the richer.
  A proper separation of functions plus extra attention to clients who
always ask for the same employee, especially at the beginning or end of
the working day or at break times, is a good step towards fraud
prevention.A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT WITH BITE
  A client had strong suspicions that an employee of his dental laboratory
was carrying out work for a competitor on his own account.
  Our investigation confirmed that he had indeed a lot of contact with the
competition and was carrying out work for the other laboratory, and that
he also carried out work for his employer's customers which he did not put
through the books.
  We also discovered that a second employee was involved with him. The two
of them had built up a strong private working relationship with each
other.
  Both employees had been with the laboratory for about 20 years, but they
had never signed a contract of employment so there were no written rules
about contact with competitors nor anything else. However, we were able to
prove that in carrying out work on their own account for the competitor
and others the two had used the materials, time and apparatus belonging to
their employer.
  Our client has now introduced a contract of employment which makes clear
what is required and what is not allowed and the consequences of breaching
that contract.AGGRESSIVE ADVERTISEMENT CANVASSING
  This `tip' is published at the request of a lawyer in the Dutch city of
Maastricht. Not only this Maastricht lawyer but also various colleagues
inside and outside the Maastricht County Court District are frequently
approached by telephone canvassers who, in an extremely cheeky, cunning
and aggressive manner, try to obtain orders for the placing of
advertisements.
  Often it goes like this.
  The subject is telephoned by a canvasser with the claim that some time
ago an agreement was made by telephone that an advertisement would be
placed, that the proof is ready and will be faxed to the subject, and that
this must be signed as approved and returned.
  Subsequently, a discussion ensues when the subject disputes the supposed
telephone agreement and the canvasser persists with his stand and says
that costs have already accrued for the proof which must be paid for in
any case.
  Cases are known where the telephone argument ends with the canvasser
saying, `We will talk to each other again in front of the judge,' after
which nothing more is heard. It has also happened that in the absence of
the lawyer, the secretary or office manager is approached (in the
foregoing manner) and that under pressure or through misunderstanding,
advertisements have been placed for which an order was never given.
  Our comment: Businesses too are approached in this way. It happens
especially during holiday periods when it is hoped that whoever is filling
in will think that a colleague has ordered the advertisement. Some
canvassers use a well known courier service to deliver the confirmation
and return with the signature. And if their account is not paid, then some
will even call in collection agencies.
  We would advise our readers that those of you who do business in the
Netherlands, if subjected to this kind of approach, could contact the
Stichting Eerlijk Zakendoen (Honest Business Foundation) who, in co-
operation with the Chambers of Commerce, are undertaking action against
these canvassers. The address of the foundation is Werkhovenstraat 94,
9546 VJ The Hague. Tel: 070 3299591, Fax: 070 3299751.DONE DIFFERENTLY
  It was strange that the head of the administration department had needed
to speak to the same driver twice about his failure to hand over the money
for paid invoices. Each time he had a different excuse: his house was
being rebuilt and in the chaos he had lost the money; he thought that he
had paid the money over and wondered if someone in the administration
department had made a mistake.
  Because the driver still enjoyed the management's full confidence it was
thought that he had not done anything dishonest, and when spoken to he had
eventually paid the money over.
  When he failed for the third time to hand over a sum of money, the
directors decided that they had had enough. Perhaps external investigators
would tackle it differently.
  When our investigators were interviewing the driver they quickly
realised that he was not very particular about telling the truth. He told
them that on the morning in question he had not been at work because he
had had to do a vocational test at the labour office. He told our
investigators the room number where he had done the test and gave them the
name and description of the examiner.
  What he did not expect was that they would check what he had told them.
The room number he had given did not exist and the examiner he had named
was on holiday. When confronted with this he admitted that he had not been
to the labour office, he simply wanted a free morning. And what about the
money that he had kept back? If no one had asked about it he would have
kept it.
  At the end of the interview he said, `You go about things differently
than they do here!'TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
  Two employees left a client company at the same time. Both of them were
experts in their speciality. Although both of them said that they were not
about to undertake competitive employment, the directors had their doubts.
We were asked to carry out an investigation as to whether or not the two
were in breach of the conditions of their former contract of employment.
  During preliminary inquiries, it became apparent that the two were
indeed employed in the same sector as their previous employer. It was
decided to contact them to ascertain how far their activities had
advanced. The first man contacted suggested a meeting in a motel.
  As usual, our investigators arrived long before the appointed time. They
saw the man they had come to meet enter accompanied by a second man. They
took their places at a table close to where our investigators were sitting
and conversed in voices which were easy to overhear. From what they were
saying, one of the men appeared to trust no one.
  When the appointed interview time arrived, our investigators introduced
themselves. The second man who had arrived introduced himself as the other
departed employee. Our investigators had intended to arrange interviews
with the men one at a time but a second interview was now unnecessary. The
conversation provided sufficient information for our investigators to be
satisfied that both men were in breach of their former contract of
employment.  OWN BOSS? YES, BUT ON OWN ACCOUNT TOO!
  A client was tired of the frequent absences of one of his employees. She
claimed to be sick but he was told that she had advertised in a local
newspaper that she gave beauty treatments at home.
  Our investigation revealed that during her periods of absence she had
undertaken various training courses in beauty care. In fact, she had
passed examinations with flying colours. Subsequently, our female
investigators made appointments with her and had facial treatments.
  She is now free to devote all her time and energy to making a success of
her beauty salon - but on her own account and not at her employer's
expense and not at the inconvenience of her colleagues who so frequently
had to do her work.A LITTLE HUMOUR GOES A LONG WAY
  In an previous article, we wrote about a managing director who, in order
to prevent further misuse of the alcoholic contents of the directors'
refrigerator, had stuck a note on the door that said: `God sees
everything'.
  One of our readers thought it a good idea and did the same. Some days
later he found a note stuck underneath his that read: `But He doesn't go
on about it'.
  The message had got across. As one of the directors said to us, `If they
know that I know, it makes a difference. A little bit of prevention.'

Fast and comfortable: Nissan's competitively priced Cefiro offers power
and safety

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 86

AS GIMMICKS GO, not many would venture so far as the engineers at Nissan.
They fitted their latest 24-valve DOHC V6 engine to power the jet
propellor of a two-seater light aircraft to prove a point.
  The point of the exercise - to prove that should anyone be so inclined,
the new Nissan Cefiro 3-litre, for which the engine was developed, can
fly. In a test drive conducted by Malaysian Business, fly it literally did
- the car, as did the E-Racer light aircraft whose successful flight one
might assume will give Nissan ideas far above their `station.'
  That may be for the future. For now, all that `fit-to-fly' technical
excellence is neatly packaged under the hood of Nissan's first foray into
the 3000cc class, which up till now has been the sole preserve of well-
established European makes in this country. The first Cefiro which was
introduced in 1988 was a hit in its home shores. But while sales were
brisk enough, it received rather lukewarm response elsewhere. Almost a
decade on, changes were made, designed to make various dimensions of the
new hybrid higher, wider and longer. In the words of Tan Hoe Pin, deputy
managing director of Edaran Tan Chong Motor Sdn Bhd, Nissan's goal was to
improve on the basic concept of the car particularly in terms of its
performance, styling, technology as well as active and passive safety
standards. The result is the creation of a sports sedan that is wide-
bodied with a high degree of luxury and comfort.
  The heartbeat of the new Cefiro V6 is its 3.0 Litre 24-Valve Double
Overhead Camshaft (DOHC) Engine Concentrated Control System (ECCS) engine
which is a proven high performance power plant that generates plenty of
power and brisk responsiveness. Despite that, it is subjected to less
vibration and, Nissan claims, is therefore less noisy. Engine roar was
detectable but not to the point of distraction. Ride comfort is extremely
smooth and fuel consumption is miserly for a 3-litre. (On a full tank, MB
clocked up 254km on the odometer before the fuel indicator began to nudge
the `fuel warning' level).
  Its extremely compact engine given the code VQ30DE with its all-
aluminium block is packed with performance enhancing technologies. For
this Nissan redesigned its original V6 engine that is 20 per cent lighter,
uses 10 per cent fewer parts and takes 40 per cent less time to put
together. The twin intake/exhaust valve configuration and narrow valve
angle combine to produce more powerful combustion, resulting in higher
output.
  Extensive friction-reducing technologies (molybdenum-coated pistons and
a microfinished crankshaft) and the use of lightweight engine components
contribute to excellent throttle response and fuel economy. The new engine
is in fact 29kg lighter, yet has 1000 cc more displacement. There is also
improved cooling with each engine block and cylinder head having separate
cooling, allowing for the use of small sized water pumps.
  Where the previous 2-litre Cefiro engine was a twin-cam six cylinder
producing 130 brake horsepower (bhp), this new engine winds up to 193bhp
peaking at 6,400 rpm with 26kg metres of torque at 4,000 rpm. Its power
and reliability was put to the test on the E-Racer aircraft. Shod with the
Cefiro engine, it took off and flew at a speed of 299 mph with a payload
of 800lbs.
  Translated to actual driving performance, what does it all mean? Sheer
power one must say. During the test drive down the Kuala Lumpur-Seremban
Highway towards the Kajang exit, it was a chore keeping the frisky beast
from bolting in defiance of the road traffic ordinance. Power appeared
readily on tap, an ever so gentle tap on the accelerator and the engine
purrs along uncomplainingly pushing the speedometer dial round the dial
face. It was only when the coast was clear (we shall not reveal the time
and place in deference of the law) that we dared push the new Cefiro to
its limits and tasted the engine's true potential.
  All the time one was on the road, there was a great feeling of comfort
and safety. With good reason too as the new Cefiro has been designed with
a comprehensive range of active and passive safety features, the most
distinctive of which are the four-channel Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) and
the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) for the driver. To enhance
structural integrity and help create a safer vehicle, the new Cefiro
features extra door padding, additional ribs in the front side member,
reinforced front and side pillars and extra bracing in the door sill.
  Additionally, front side structural members are designed to crush
progressively to help minimise intrusion into the passenger cabin. All
door panels are also reinforced with internal side door beams for added
resistance to side impact. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) seatbelts
with vertically adjustable anchors for the front seats help maximise
safety for passengers.
  The cabin interior gives the Cefiro an air of efficient functionality.
Indeed smoothly unfussy. All the key controls are within easy reach. The
central dividing panel housing the controls of the sound system and air-
conditioning is well laid out. The air-conditioning level is digitally
controlled with the occupants needing simply to key in the required
temperature level and adjusting the position of the air vents at the push
of a button.
  A twin sprung cup holder rests on the central divider forward of a deep
cushion-covered tray to stash away an assortment of knick knacks away from
prying eyes. The passenger side sun flap has a thoughtful touch - - when
pulled towards the occupant, a rectangular flap can be flicked open to
reveal a decent-sized vanity mirror with two tiny light bulbs on either
side.
  Nissan calls the new Cefiro a luxury sedan. In the ride comfort
department, this tag is well-deserved. Its rear multi-link beam suspension
takes care of all the bumps and ruts any neglected road long overdue for a
VIP visitor can offer. The rear wheels are mounted on a torsion beam to
maximise tyre grip, eliminating scuff changes and variation in vehicle
attitude when taking corners which tends to induce fatigue all round.
  In straight-line driving, the suspension minimises body sway and
maintains a steady stance for directional stability. The ride is quiet and
comfortable with little vibration and noise. When negotiating corners, the
load is optimally distributed over the four tyres to increase stability.
  There is a little idiosyncratic touch too - all the car doors lock
automatically within a few seconds of the driver side door being closed
without it being locked itself! The sound system takes some getting used
to as a number of stations appear to be transmitting programmes from some
huge cavern, complete with echo.
  One surprisingly contentious issue which surfaced when the car was first
introduced to the motoring journalism fraternity was Edaran TCM's pricing
strategy. A few seasoned campaigners who found that at RM138,000, (on-the-
road with metallic paint) they could now afford 3-litre luxury on their
pay package, insisted something was amiss. `Where's the luxury and
exclusivity if humble `ol me can afford one?' opined a highly distressed
and venerable editor of a equally venerable automobile monthly. His
colleague chipped in to support albeit with self-deprecating candour,
`It's too affordable. I'll buy it and that is sure to kill any designs of
turning the car into a really serious status symbol.'
  The last word must go to Tan. He says, `The new Cefiro is not cheap.
Just competitively priced. We received 100 bookings even before the
launch.'Specifications: Nissan Cefiro V6 3.0L Automatic

Fired by hypermarkets: Metrojaya brings style and ambience to its Cosmart
hypermarkets

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 49

LATER THIS MONTH, leading retailer Metrojaya Bhd will open the doors of
its newest venture, a 85,000 sq ft hypermarket in the Pandan Capitol
shopping mall in Pandan Indah, Kuala Lumpur. It hopes to draw not only
hordes of the 100,000 residents of the township but also shoppers from
further afield such as Ampang and Cheras.
  Metrojaya reckons that purchases at this hypermarket would add another
RM65 million annually to company coffers - a boost which the public-listed
company could do with. For the past three financial years (1994 to 1996)
group turnover has grown only marginally from RM221 million to RM238
million. The main reason, according to Lee Cheng Toh, general manager of
Metrojaya Departmental Stores, is that Metrojaya has not set up any major
departmental store (except for the smaller specialty stores) since its
last one at Menara Bakti in Petaling Jaya's Section 14 back in 1992. `In
an over-retail market, much incremental growth cannot be expected from
existing stores. It has to be fired by new big stores,' she says.
  However, with its hypermarket venture, turnover is set to perk up. After
all early birds Carrefour and Giant have demonstrated that hypermarkets -
a vast, no frills, self-service, warehouse kind of shopping environment
where the draw is cheaper prices - are making a big hit with shoppers
looking for bargains all year round.
  Now other retailers want to get into the act. Take Metrojaya, which has
traditionally positioned its departmental stores and specialty shops (with
the exception of Reject Shop) in the higher end of the market, now opting
to sprinkle its `Metro Magic' nearer the other end too. As Lee admits,
`The main core of the market is still the mass market, the below middle
income group. While Metrojaya has done exceedingly well in its mid-to-
upper market niche, we are missing out on this large segment.'
  To carve out a share of the mass market, Cosmart Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Metrojaya, was incorporated to start a chain of Cosmart
hypermarkets offering general merchandise and supermarket goods (from
foodstuffs to electrical to clothing) at very competitive rates. Besides
its maiden outlet at Pandan Indah, Cosmart will operate a second
hypermarket in the Bukit Jambul Complex up north in Penang by April 1997.
Down south, in Seremban, another Cosmart hypermarket is slated to be the
anchor tenant of a new shopping complex to be jointly developed by
subsidiaries of Metrojaya and PhileoLand Bhd. It should be operational by
the end of 1998.
  But even before this Seremban outlet, Cosmart is scouting hard for
another site within the Klang Valley or in Johor Bahru, unperturbed that
the sites might become a hot bed of competition. Says Chai Chin Cheok,
assistant general manager of Cosmart, `As a retailer, we cannot be afraid
of competition.'
  However, competition is dogging its heels. One of the country's biggest
retailers, Parkson Corporation Sdn Bhd, which reportedly raked in over RM1
billion in sales this year, will launch its first hypermarket (the Xtra
Supercentre chain) at the UE Shopping Mall in Cheras in December, right
after Metrojaya's Pandan Indah's opening. On a straight-line projection,
the two hypermarkets will be about 5 km apart. Furthermore, Parkson is
also expected to have five hypermarkets in major towns such as Johor Bahru
and Ipoh, and in Penang by the end of next year.
  Giant TMC Bhd, one of the early birds in the hypermarket scene with its
very successful Giant Cash & Carry in Subang Jaya, has announced that it
will sink in at least RM50 million to set up three more hypermarkets in
Cheras (again), Ipoh and Johor Bahru within the next three years and has
bought, or is in the process of buying, the land for the marts. Last
month, it opened its second Giant hypermarket in Ulu Klang. It is also
eyeing Penang and Kota Bahru as possible hypermarket locations in its
future expansion plans.
  Being neither the first nor the last to set up hypermarkets, what edge
has Metrojaya got over the rest of the pack?
  Ambience, for one, says Lee. `In terms of design and physical setup, we
have  tried to be more interesting, more organised, more colourful, to
have more signages so that customers will be able to locate their
purchases easily from day one, and to essentially turn the normally drab
look of hypermarkets into a more pleasing shopping ambience. For instance,
in our clothing section, we don't just have rows of blouses and rows of
skirts, but we also have coordinated displays of tops and bottoms.'
  Another is merchandising. Cosmart hypermarkets do not follow the rule of
thumb about stocking the shelves with whatever is cheap. `Metrojaya's
buying culture that quality is better than price is also being adopted in
Cosmart. Our buyers are trained not to compromise too much on quality just
for price's sake,' says Lee. `Hence, we are not out to declare that we are
the cheapest, but that we are competitively priced and we give value for
money.'
  Chai is quick to assert that this does not mean Cosmart is not striving
for low prices. `In sourcing for our goods, we cut out a lot of the
middlemen. For instance, with vegetables we go direct to the farmers.'
  Cosmart will have to cough up RM15 million in terms of set-up and
inventory costs for the Pandan Indah outlet and RM20 million each for the
Penang and Seremban hypermarkets. With an authorised and paid-up capital
of only RM3 million and RM1 million respectively (though these will be
increased to RM10 million and RM5 million), the funding will come from
parent Metrojaya. Metrojaya recently got the greenlight for a one-for-two
bonus issue and a three-for-one rights issue at RM3 a share. The rights
exercise will raise RM252 million next year, part of which will go to
finance the Cosmart operations.
  Metrojaya plans to have six Cosmart hypermarkets in the country by the
year 2000. By then Cosmart should be contributing as much as 30 per cent
to group turnover, same as Metrojaya's specialty stores, with the
remainder coming from the departmental store operations.

A new way to fly: Heli Asia is a platform for helicopter manufacturing
sub-contracting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 53

HELICOPTER manufacturers sub-contracting parts of the aircraft in
Malaysia.
  Alexander Shephard, managing director of a UK-based aviation magazine
publisher, the Shephard Press, says this trend is already apparent in
several Asian countries such as China, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
  Shephard, who is also chairman of Shephard Conference, says for example,
there was a joint venture with a 39 per cent work share package between
China and Singapore companies in the manufacturing of the European Union's
Eurocopter 120. Besides this, the South Korean Daewoo Group is
collaborating with a Russian  company in the production of the MK-30
helicopter, while an Australian company, Hawk Pacific, is venturing into
the manufacturing of components for the McDonnell Douglas Corp's Explorer.
  Shephard says, `Of late, the American helicopter manufacturers have
become more aware that they will not be able to sell their aircrafts
without an offset programme such as in the manufacturing of components.'
He believes there is a growing demand for helicopter services among the
local companies and organisations such as in oil and gas exploration, the
police force and even an air ambulance service.
  `Just think of the hassles of going through a traffic jam. With the
availability of helicopter landing platforms in most of the high-rise
buildings in Kuala Lumpur, I do not think it impossible that more
companies will resort to using such aircrafts as a means of
transportation,' he adds. Shephard was in Kuala Lumpur for the inaugural
Heli Asia Conference and Exhibition held from Nov 5-7 at the Shangri-La
Hotel. The event, organised by Shephard Conference, was held to provide an
insight into the helicopter industry as well as business opportunities in
producing the aircraft components, and to address the civil and defence
helicopter operations within the expanding Asian market.
  Among the topics discussed at the conference were the areas of support
helicopters, naval helicopters, tactical doctrine, battlefield survival,
training, attack helicopters and operational experience. `Heli Asia is the
region's first event devoted entirely to the helicopter industry,'
Shephard says.
  The three-day conference and exhibition, covering both civil and
military rotary-wing aviation, attracted some 4,000 trade visitors. A
total of 120 exhibitors from over 26 countries participated. The United
States had the biggest representation with well-known helicopter
manufacturers like Boeing Helicopters, Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter Asia.
Other exhibitors included Eurocopter SA, Westland Helicopter, Teledyne Inc
and Turbomeca of France.
  Franco-German helicopter manufacturer, Eurocopter, a subsidiary of Aero-
spatiale of France, announced that they had sealed a deal for the purchase
of their newest lightweight helicopter, the EC135, to the Tengku Mahkota
of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah. Tengku Abdullah will be the
first Asian to take delivery of the EC135 when it arrives here early next
year. Launched in 1994, the EC135, the lightest in the light-twin engine
class, is a seven/eight-seater which can be utilised as an emergency
evacuation vehicle.
  Asked why the organiser chose Kuala Lumpur as the first venue for the
event, Shephard explains it is mainly due to the growing number of
helicopter users among Malaysian companies and organisations. Malaysia is
an ideal location for bringing people in. `It is a big opportunity for the
Western world to influence decision makers in Asia,' Stephenson says,
adding that it will serve as the key venue for these regions as well as
open the door to this huge and largely untapped market. Promotions on Heli
Asia were held during the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace
(Lima) '95 exhibition.
  Shephard says Heli Asia has presented opportunities for new partnerships
and joint ventures in these areas as Asia is now a source of financing for
new technology projects. `We believe Heli Asia is a success,' he says.
  Shephard confirms that Kuala Lumpur will re-host the second Heli Asia in
1998 in light of the favourable response to the inaugural event and
because of its strategic location. He adds that there is the possibility
of more static and flying demonstrations in 1998 at the Sultan Abdul Aziz
Shah International Airport in Subang when it is turned into an aviation
exhibition centre after the KL  International Airport in Sepang becomes
operational.
  `We will eventually turn the event into the largest rotary-wing
exhibition in the region in years to come,' Shephard adds.
  Malaysia Airlines chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli feels that helicopters,
commonly used for military and security operations, are making their
presence felt in commercial aviation. He says helicopters are known to be
the most effective form of transport and workhorse for the offshore oil
industry, transporting medical supplies to the remote interior, search and
rescue, and in recent years, extracting timber from remote jungles.
  `Tourism will especially be boosted with more helicopter charter
operations to the many resort islands and tourist spots. That's why we
need more heliports in cities,' Tajudin says.
  During the exhibition, US helicopter giant Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
concluded two Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Malaysian Helicopter
Services Bhd (MHS) and Airod Sdn Bhd to pave the way for the setting up of
Asia's second service centre for the S-76C helicopters after Tokyo. The
MOUs were part of the offset programme following Malaysia's order for two
US-made Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk helicopters for VIP transport.
  Sikorsky's managing director (Malaysia) John J Carson says his company
has signed a service centre agreement to allow both parties to evaluate it
before a final decision on the matter can be reached. MHS operates six S-
76Cs and four Eurocopter Super Pumas for offshore operations. Of the Black
Hawks, Carson says both are expected to be delivered by March 1998. One
helicopter will fly with four additional fuel tanks giving it extended
range.
  The Black Hawks boast high-tech avionics, including the Honeywell
Electronic Flight Information System, and is based on the basic UH-60A
Black Hawk airframe.
  Another US giant, Boeing Helicopters, is negotiating with the Malaysian
government to sell six CH-47 Chinooks, heavy-lift helicopters, to the
RMAF. Boeing representative Jack Satterfield says the talks are in the
preliminary stages. The CH-47 Chinook is currently in service with most
air forces in the world, including Singapore and Thailand. Kawasaki Heavy
Industries assembles the Chinook under licence locally where Japan is the
largest operator of the helicopter outside the United States.

Shopping in a green world: Britain's first environmentally friendly
supermarket opens its doors

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 51

IT HAD TO come: a chain of supermarkets with an environmental conscience.
Out of This World is heralded by its originators as `a one-stop shopping
ethical experience that enables people to shop in the high street and
invest in a better world at the same time'.
  `Rather than the customer having to go to several outlets in search of
environmentally friendly products, we provide everything under the same
roof,' says Andy Houghton, manager of the branch in Bristol, west of
England.
  `It has been estimated that around five per cent of the population are
ethically aware but only one per cent actually do anything about it,' he
adds. Houghton's branch is the second to open out of a chain of 200 shops
planned.
  Described by a leading newspaper as `the most radical experiment in
British retailing for 1ystem centuries', Out of This World is the brainchild
of Richard Adams, someone with impeccable credentials for starting such a
venture.
  In 1972, Adams set up an agricultural imports company, working with
horticultural groups in developing countries that lead to the founding of
Teacraft, the craft-marketing arm of the major UK relief and development
charity, the TEAR fund.
  Furthermore, in 1979, Adams established the independent company,
Traidcraft, that become a public company in 1984 offering the first
`alternative' public share issue in the United Kingdom. Todate, Traidcraft
has marketed over STG30 million of craft, food and clothing products from
the Third World, and its linked charity, Traidcraft Exchange, has engaged
in large-scale community business development projects in several
developing countries.
  `For 25 years I've been involved in many organisations which help people
to shop or invest for a better world. Out of This World is doing just
that, right on the local high street,' says Adams.
  Out of This World is the official trading name for the Creative Consumer
Cooperative. Anyone can join. Membership costs STG5 for life,
automatically making customers into shareholders who, consequently, can be
extremely influential on all aspects of the shops.
  Shareholders become eligible for in-store promotions and they receive
regular updates on the progress of the society and eventually a dividend
on purchases. As Adams says, `This is a business with a difference - owned
and run by a community of people seeking to increase their commitment to a
more sustainable lifestyle and a safer world.'
  It would be hard to imagine a more environmentally correct chain of
shops than Out of This World. The whole nature of the shops is as `green'
as could be: the coolants in the freezer cabinets have been replaced by
the non-hazardous refrigerant, CARE 50, that neither depletes the ozone
layer nor contributes to global warming.
  The counter tops are made out of recycled plastic bottles and the
shelving is processed from pine thinnings from managed plantations. It
almost goes without saying that the paints, finishes and stains are all
solvent-free and that the labelling and promotions use recycled card and
board.
  Bristol manager Houghton adds, `We cover the globe. We have about 80
suppliers who source hundreds of products from Asia, Africa, South America
and countries across the developing world.'
  A long-term aim is to have computer data instantly available on every
product, specifying its `green' credentials and its provenance. At the
moment, only 10 per cent of the stock is on the system. But as Houghton
declares, `We're got to be transparent. It is crucial we justify
everything we do and stock.'
  There is a strong emphasis on organic produce including vegetables,
dairy products, herbs, spices, cereals, wines, beer, bread, fruit and
meat. The choice of products is extremely wide, and apart from the
predictable pulses, there are Indian, Mexican, Japanese and kosher
foodstuffs as well as numerous types of oils, including walnut, almond,
grapeseed, sesame, olive and hazelnut.
  The honey section is equally extensive, including clear types from Chile
and delicious Tabora honey from Tanzania produced by a bee-keepers'
cooperative. Everything on sale has been screened for additives - even the
tomato ketchup.
  An attractive aspect of the stores is that in addition to the main
stock, each shop will also have a selection of products and crafts sourced
locally. For instance, the Bristol branch sells handicraft baskets made
from willows grown in the Somerset levels. `We buy locally whenever we
can,' says Houghton.
  This admirable policy saves Out of This World from being another chain
of identical-looking shops and gives each store a regional character all
of its own. Also available are books, including cookery, yoga and
children's titles, cosmetics and aromatherapy items and clothes made of
cotton.
  New customers are often cautious. `Yes, it can look a bit exotic,'
admits Houghton. `But there are plenty of satisfied customers who say
things like, "I haven't tasted bacon like this since I was a child".' -

Getting a grip: The proposed listing of Multi-Purpose Capital Holdings may
just give the

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 6

MYRIAD AND multifarious. That perhaps best describes the sprawling
Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group today - the growing empire of tycoon Datuk
Lim Thian Kiat.
  At age 36, the reclusive tycoon controls at least six listed companies -
Kamunting Corporation Bhd, Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd (MPHB), Magnum
Corporation Bhd, Bandar Raya Developments Bhd, Leisure Management Bhd and
Malaysian Plantations Bhd. Most of them seem to be interlinked via
complicated crossholdings. Lim also holds the second largest stake in
Sarawak Enterprise Corporation Bhd (formerly Dunlop Estates Bhd).
  The sheer number of listed companies in his stable means that Lim has
his fingers in a great many pies. For example, gaming is carried out via
Magnum and Leisure Management, finance and banking via Multi-Purpose
Holdings, property development via Bandar Raya Developments, stockbroking
via Malaysian Plantations which owns JB Securities, and toll collection
via Kamunting Corporation Bhd which holds the Jalan Kuching toll
concession. He is also involved in electricity via Sarawak Enterprise
Corporation.
  Although the last couple of years may have been relatively quiet for the
Kamunting-MPHB Group, the board has nevertheless kept busy. Significant
events include the acquisition of stockbroker JB Securities, relinguishing
control of Dunlop Estates (now Sarawak Enterprise Corporation), the
completion of its multi-million ringgit headquarters in Kuala Lumpur and
the controversy which erupted over its Kepong toll concession. There has
also been the much talked about proposed listing of Multi-Purpose Capital
Holdings Bhd (M Capital). MPHB minority shareholders are hoping for a
windfall in the form of a restricted offer for sale.
  Unfortunately, with MPHB being involved in such a complex and diverse
web of activities, it causes difficulties for analysts and investors alike
to get a grip on the Lim colossus.
  Says an analyst, `We don't follow MPHB because it's too complex. And we
don't know his direction. Investors and shareholders like to know what is
in store.' The tycoon's low profile is of no help either.
  This is particularly true of Lim's flagship company, MPHB. Currently,
very few analysts track the counter, citing complexity and opacity.
However, an analyst from a major retail stockbroking house says it's
probably about time to start studying the counter, `Maybe in a month's
time.' The relatively stagnant share price is also a deterrent. MPHB has
been drifting in the region of between RM3.30 and RM4.30 the past year.
Says a stockbroker tongue-in-cheek, `That's because it's a main board
company.'
  But it cannot be denied that MPHB is one of the heavyweights of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). As at Nov 2, its market capitalisation
was RM3.214 billion, ranking it at number 41. Even heavier was Magnum at
RM6.555 billion, placing it at 16th place.
  The torpor in the trading of MPHB shares can also be attributed to the
lack of fresh major corporate developments. Says an analyst, `There's only
one million-dollar question at MPHB - when will M Capital be listed?' M
Capital is the holding company for the group's commercial banking arm,
Multi-Purpose Bank Bhd (formerly known as Malaysian-French Bank Bhd).
  M Capital holds 70 per cent in the bank while the remainder is held by
Banque Indosuez of Paris. The group's finance company, Multi-Purpose
Finance Bhd, its general insurance company Multi-Purpose Insurance Bhd,
and Multi-Purpose Credit Holdings Sdn Bhd all also come under the umbrella
of M Capital.
  But there has been some speculation that Multi-Purpose Bank itself may
be listed separately. However, MPHB executive director Khaw Chay Tee
dismisses such talk. `There are currently no firm plans to list Multi-
Purpose Bank. The management is concentrating its efforts on achieving
Tier-1 Status for the bank under the two-tier regulatory system, as soon
as possible.'
  Even so, some analysts speculate that Lim is still desirous of floating
his financial arm. If this is so, then he is probably undaunted by the
fact that the proposed listing of M Capital had already been turned down
once before. In 1994, the proposed flotation of M Capital was thrown out
by the Securities Commission.
  The reason? Non-compliance with the chain-listing requirements. The
rules state that the subsidiary to be listed must not contribute to more
than 35 per cent of its parent's pre-tax profit. Also, the proposed
listing could have hit another snag - Magnum Corp and Leisure Management,
both of whom are gaming-based, hold shares in Multi-Purpose Finance.
  Now, though, it's a different story. The group undertook a restructuring
exercise which delineated its activities into clear-cut areas like finance
and gaming. With the restructuring, analysts estimate that M Capital
contributes about 25 per cent to MPHB's group profits. Thus, the chain-
listing issue does not arise anymore.
  The gaming-finance conflict has also been resolved by putting Magnum and
M Capital at arms' length. Recently, MPHB made a voluntary general offer
for all the shares in subsidiary M Capital that it does not own. This will
relieve Magnum of its stake in M Capital and enable the former to comply
with a Bank Negara directive to divest its entire interests in Multi-
Purpose Finance.
  MPHB currently holds 168 million shares, or 76.36 per cent, in M
Capital. The rest belongs to Magnum, Leisure Management and Kamunting. The
offer price for the shares would be RM2.60 per share, thus involving a
total cash payout of RM135.2 million.
  Whether this price consideration for the minority shareholders of
Magnum, Leisure Management and Kamunting truly reflects the fair value of
M Capital cannot be ascertained. Says a research head, `With the recent
reorganisation of the group, M Capital's likelihood of getting listed is
bright.'
  Indeed, market rumours continue to be rife as to which second board
counter will be the target of a reverse takeover by M Capital. Even Red-
Box was at one time the hot favourite. But Khaw dispels the reverse
takeover talk (see sidebar).
  But the fact remains that Multi-Purpose Bank is the jewel in M Capital.
The bank had shareholders' funds of RM315.5 million in 1995. It needs to
increase this to RM500 million to make it to Tier-1. At end-1995, its
total assets stood at RM8.5 billion, total deposits at RM3.9 billion and
total loans at RM3.2 billion.
  With the reengineering, there was also a clearer direction for the MPHB
Group. However, most analysts are still vague about what that is. Asks
one, `Do they have a focus?'
  Explains Khaw, `Since 1991, the MPHB Group has had three core
businesses, namely financial services, property and gaming. The group was
therefore in a position, at the end of 1995, to take on the challenge of
an additional core business in the form of electricity generation,
transmission and distribution through Sarawak Enterprise.'
  For the year ended Dec 31, 1995, MPHB achieved a pre-tax profit of
RM525.85 million, a 17 per cent increase over the previous year's profit
of RM449.87 million. Turnover increased from RM2.6 billion to RM2.87
billion. Of this amount, the banking and financial services division
chalked up profits of RM116.7 million. The property division recorded
profits of RM150.31 million while the gaming division proved to be the
cash cow with profits of RM384.04 million.
  However, profits and turnover are expected to take a drastic dive in
FY1996 because of the transformation of former subsidiaries, Sarawak
Enterprise Corporation and Magnum Corporation, into associate companies
via the restructuring exercise.
  At end-1994, MPHB had three listed subsidiaries - 51.04 per cent of
Magnum, 51 per cent of Sarawak Enterprise and 36.9 per cent of Bandar
Raya. But the stakes in Sarawak Enterprise and Magnum have since been
trimmed to less than 30 per cent.
  For the half-year ended June 30, 1996, MPHB's profit dropped by 31 per
cent to RM157.84 million from RM227.43 million the previous corresponding
period. The lower profit was recorded on the back of a much-reduced group
turnover of RM415.882 million against RM1.305 billion in the first half of
1995.
  Apart from lower contributions from Magnum and Sarawak Enterprise,
analysts expect MPHB to suffer a massive hit of about RM47 million in
interest charges on its RM600 million revolving credit facility. Announced
in January 1996, this loan is to finance its purchase of 262.86 million
Magnum shares on the basis of nine Magnum shares for every 10 Dunlop (now
Sarawak Enterprise) shares held as at Dec 27, 1995. It is believed this
exercise will demarcate Magnum and Sarawak Enterprise into wholly separate
entities with MPHB as the holding company.
  However, analysts say the high interest charges will be dissipated with
the proposed rights issue of a five-year, three per cent irredeemable
convertible unsecured loan stocks (ICULs) on the basis of one ICUL for one
share. There will also be a special Bumiputera issue of 15.022 million
shares at RM3.80 each.
  Taking into account the new Bumiputera issue and the full conversion of
warrants and employee share options, MPHB's paid-up capital would balloon
from an estimated RM751.1 million to over RM1 billion. However, the
dilution in earnings per share, given the inflated share capital, should
be neutralised by contributions from new associate Sarawak Enterprise.
  Reckons an analyst, `The diversification into electricity generation
will power earnings in the medium term. Its investment in Sarawak
Enterprise will enable the group to become a power generator and
distributor in Sarawak.'
  For the year ending Dec 31, 1996, analysts forecast a pre-tax profit of
RM350 million on a turnover of RM943.3 million, a sharp drop compared with
1995's profits of RM525.85 million and turnover of RM2.87 billion.
  This would put FY1996 net earnings per share (EPS) at 21.1 sen. Given a
current market price of around RM4.40, the shares are trading at
prospective price earnings (PE) multiple of 21 times.
  For FY1997, analysts estimate improved pre-tax profits of RM420 million
on a turnover base of RM1.132 billion. Based on a net EPS of 25.4 sen, the
shares will trade at a prospective PE multiple of 17.3 times.

Editorial: Heed Auditor-General's report

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 1

IF THE Auditor-General feels frustrated at times, he has good reason to.
Every year, he highlights irregular accounting practices, mismanagement of
funds and dereliction of duty in state agencies. And every year these
agencies continue to ignore his advice and recommendations.
  But each time the Auditor-General's report is released, there is the
usual excitement and publicity in the media followed by comments from
various quarters. Initially, there will a chorus call to rectify the
situation. But after sometime, the excitement fizzles out.
  Take the example of Penang's state secretariat which failed to submit
records on revenue for 18 out of 42 housing schemes. `This failure has
been highlighted several times in the past, but to date, it has not been
rectified,' laments Datuk Mohd Khalil Mohd Noor in his 1994 report.
  We can understand his frustration. But the nagging question remains -
why are some government servants, politicians included, so defiant?
  Is it a case of a shortage of staff, plain ignorance or simply, a
lackadaisical attitude?
  Widespread discrepancies in the accounts of government agencies are not
something to be taken lightly. It can give rise to all kinds of
allegations, including corrupt practices. Menteri besars and chief
ministers should ensure that all government agencies attempt to put things
right as soon as possible.
  Earlier this month, it was announced that a government committee will be
established to see if action needs to be taken against two states for
irregular accounting practices. It is a laudable move.
  But more needs to be done. For a start, every state should set up a
special panel to address shortcomings highlighted in the Auditor-General's
report.
  Each of these panels should be compelled to give a detailed report to
the finance minister as to what course of action has been taken to address
the discrepancies. Disciplinary action should be taken against states
which remain defiant.
  Civil servants are entrusted with public funds. That trust must not be
betrayed. It boils down to a question of accountability to the rakyat.
After all, is it not the taxpayers who pay their salaries and bonuses?

Expanding horizons: With Samsung Malaysia's expansion programme in its
Seremban complex in i

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 18

WHEN making glass, pure sand is a prerequisite. Says Samsung Malaysia
president and managing director Kim Jin Ki, `We used to use Australian
sand to make glass (monitors and funnels at Samsung Corning Malaysia Sdn
Bhd). Now we use Johor sand, which is cheaper to transport.'
  Of course, using Johor sand as a core ingredient is not merely a means
to trim costs. The gesture can also be interpreted as a measure of Samsung
Malaysia's commitment towards localising operations. Says Kim, `Our local
component ratio, including the sand, is 81 per cent. Some components are
still made in Korea.'
  Nevertheless, Samsung Malaysia's search for local component
manufacturers is still going strong. Says Kim, `Our target next year is to
have between 81-85 per cent local content.'
  Samsung Malaysia's desire for local content is not confined to
production alone. The workforce is also being Malaysianised. Currently,
this Korean chaebol employs more than 7,500 staff in its ten Malaysian
companies (refer to table and pie chart). Departments are now mostly
headed by Malaysians with the aim of employing locals for top positions.
There are about a hundred Korean expatriates, including Kim himself.
  Says Kim, `Our target is to bring this down to 50 or 60 Koreans in two
or three years, or fewer than one per cent Korean.' Technicians and
engineers are continually sent to Samsung facilities in Korea for
training. From 1991 to 1996, 782 employees were sent to Korea for six
months' training, says Kim.
  Despite Samsung Malaysia's attempts to promote localisation, a wholly-
Malaysian workforce is not an attainable goal if locals simply don't want
to join them. Given the country's zero unemployment situation, it's very
hard to find workers, says Kim. To fill vacancies, Samsung Malaysia has
resorted to hiring foreigners. Says Kim, `They get the same pay as locals.
Actually, we pay them more because we cover their transportation and
lodging costs.' (Refer to boxed story.) Right now, there are 900
Indonesians working at Samsung, `with the permission of the state
government'.
  If localisation is a priority in Samsung Malaysia's manufacturing
activities, the reverse is true of the company's sales. Like other
multinationals, Samsung Malaysia's markets span the globe. Says Kim, `Of
the manufacturing activities, 99.5 per cent of the products manufactured
in the four factories are exported.'
  Penetrating international markets is necessary for Samsung Malaysia,
since it is impossible for the local market to provide much depth. For
instance, Samsung Malaysia expects 1996 total sales from three of its four
factories - Samsung Electron Devices (M) Sdn Bhd, Samsung Corning (M) Sdn
Bhd and Samsung Electronics Display (M) Sdn Bhd, which are housed at the
Samsung Electronics Seremban Complex - to touch RM2.3 billion. The very
next year, sales are projected at RM3.3 billion, or a walloping 50 per
cent jump. Currently, picture tubes make up 50 per cent of sales while
monitors contribute another 30-35 per cent.
  Such massive growth is due to Samsung Malaysia's expansion programme at
the Seremban Complex. Says Kim, `We are now in the final stage of the
expansion programme, so we will have more capacity next year. This year,
we produced seven million picture tubes. Next year, it will be 11
million.' Likewise, Samsung Malaysia is increasing the production of its
14-inch and 15-inch monitors. Currently, it produces 20 million electron
guns, of which 99 per cent are exported.
  A substantial percentage of Samsung Malaysia's output ends up in other
companies' products. For example, a Samsung Malaysia electron gun might be
incorporated in rival brands' TV sets.
  Says Kim, `We have around 20 per cent of the picture tube market. In
most TVs, one out of five picture tubes are supplied by Samsung. Many
Japanese companies in Malaysia and Singapore are using our picture tubes.'
The story is similar in the personal computer industry where PC makers are
likely to use Samsung monitors.
  Says Kim, `Our main clients for monitors are American buyers. Legally we
cannot reveal who is buying our products but they're private brands. The
top PC makers are using Samsung monitors; all the top, from number one to
number 10. Almost all PC makers take our monitors and we have more than 25
per cent of the market share.'
  Since monitors make up a huge chunk of Samsung Malaysia's sales, will
the American inventory overhang in personal computers and the projected
slowdown in the American demand for PCs affect the 1997 sales projection
of RM3.3 billion? No, says Kim, adding, `There won't be much impact.
Samsung monitors are rated the highest in the world. Quality-wise, cost-
wise, we are very competitive, and we have a very good location.'
  The `location' is the Seremban Complex, which encompasses 52 hectares on
the outskirts of Seremban, in the burgeoning township of Taman Tuanku
Jaafar. Says Kim, `So far, Samsung Malaysia has invested almost RM2
billion in this complex.
  But Samsung's investment won't halt here. More money will be pumped into
the Seremban Complex in future, says Kim. For instance, an internal
broadcasting system is being set up at the complex. `This is the first of
its kind in Malaysia and the first system to be implemented in Samsung
outside of Korea,' says Kim.
  Costing US$ 2 million (RM5 million), the broadcasting system will serve
as an inhouse communications tool as well as an avenue for entertainment.
Broadcasts will cover company policies, education and training, safety
procedures, production status reports, notices and documentary programmes
like National Geographic. About 175 TV monitors will be set up around the
Seremban Complex. Again, there's a localisation factor. Says Kim, `The
broadcasting system will be run by local Samsung employees currently
undergoing training in Korea.'SAMSUNG COMPANIES IN MALAYSIA: ESTIMATED TURNOVER (1996)

The uptrend remains intact: The Composite Index gets a boost from Tenaga

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 73

THE KUALA LUMPUR Stock Exchange's Composite Index peaked at 1,180.79
points on Budget day on Oct 25. There was nothing negative about the
Budget except that there was no reduction in corporate tax. The longer
term impact is positive as it liberalises the market by widening the scope
of financial services that stockbroking firms can offer. So the sell-off
after the Budget was due to the usual market phenomenon of `sell on fact'
as profit taking quickly moved in, causing the KLSE CI to drift to a low
1,156.92.
  But the KLSE CI refused to dip any lower than 1,156.92. Suddenly it
rebounded vibrantly upwards, retesting the 1,180 resistance. It was Tenaga
Nasional Bhd that came to the rescue. There was a re-rating on Tenaga. Its
share price took a sharp upturn from a low RM8.55 to close at RM11 on Nov
6. As Tenaga constitutes some nine per cent of the market, the KLSE CI
could be said to have been driven by the counter.
  It appears that the near term performance of the Malaysian stockmarket
is not affected by the US presidential election on Nov 5. There were some
market talks that our market might drift downwards after the US election.
As at Nov 6 the KLSE CI just ignored the US election as it continued to
nudge higher, retesting 1,180. The underlying strength of the KLSE CI is
due to Tenaga. Technically, Tenaga could go as high as RM11.70. Roughly, a
10 sen move in Tenaga translates to one index point on the KLSE CI. Tenaga
at RM11 will contribute another seven index points if the upside target of
RM11.70 materialises.
  Technically, the longer term uptrend remains intact as long as the
support at 1,158 is not breached. But the near-term outlook points to a
possible technical pullback to around the 1,160 area before resuming its
upward push to 1,194. The KLSE CI should maintain its current uptrend for
the rest of 1996. The first quarter of 1997 may be technically negative
for the market.
  On the weekly equivolume chart the CI is exhibiting signs of profit
taking. The equivolume chart combines volume with price to create an
equivolume box. The height of the box is the price range and the width,
the volume. The theory holds that the price  range should expand as volume
increases, whilst failure to expand on high volume is a sign of profit
taking.
  A squarish box appeared on the Budget week high of 1,180.79. One would
expect the price range to expand as the market drifted higher. Instead the
price range narrowed, suggesting some selling pressure. The following
week, the market drifted lower to 1,156.92 but closed at a high. The price
range was longer suggesting that buyers were willing to chase the market
upwards or, simply stated, the market was facilitating trades with the
buyers. This longer price range from the low of 1,156.92 also suggests
strong buying support, and technically the support at 1,158 makes some
sense as it is within this area.
  In summary the CI is expected to be riding on the current uptrend
towards the end of 1996 as long as the 1,158 support remains intact. If it
breaks the 1,194 resistance, then the next target will be 1,213. An upkick
above 1,213 will move the market to 1,248.

Landbank edge: With a landbank worth RM1 billion, Johor Land Bhd will be
busy in south

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 29

NEXT TIME a new township sprouts up in south Johor, chances are that Johor
Land Berhad (JLB) has had a hand in building it. Besides developing low-
and medium-cost housing (RM80,000 to RM100,000 range) in south Johor's
satellite towns such as Tampoi, Tebrau, Larkin and Senai, the property
development arm of Johor Corporation (JCorp) is snapping up more land
outside Johor Baru and building fast.
  The nation-wide demand for houses will certainly keep JLB busy for a
long time. Says JLB managing director A F M (Abul Fareed Mohd) Shafiqul
Hafiz, `Malaysia has not met 50 to 60 per cent of its housing needs,
compared to almost 95 per cent in Singapore. There is a huge gap. Even in
bad times, you need to eat, you need a roof to live under'.
  JLB, Shafiqul says, builds and sells houses at what he terms `efficient
price' (lower price achieved through savings in labour and material
costs). Having completed 17,000 residential and commercial units worth
RM629 million, JLB has plans for more. They include bungalows and terrace
houses, properties that are not really cheap but demand for which is
outstripping supply. Shafiqul says `JLB isn't building only luxury homes,
but quality ones.'
  Over the next five years, the JLB Group (comprising three wholly-owned
subsidiaries and an associate company) will build over 7,000 units worth
RM600 million. The units range from commercial property, low/medium cost
flats to terrace houses and bungalows.
  JLB's strength is its almost unlimited access to land in south Johor,
one of the most economically vibrant regions in the country. Being part of
the Singapore-Johor-Riau-Indonesia growth triangle, the region draws a lot
of foreign investments.
  Considering JCorp's large holdings - about 80,000 hectares in south
Johor and Pahang - none of the developers in Johor can match JLB's
landbank. Bandaraya Developments Bhd, United Malayan Land Bhd and Kuok
Brothers Sdn Bhd come close but they are still not in the same league as
JLB.
  With a landbank worth over RM1 billion, excluding the recently acquired
Ulu Tiram land, JLB has plenty to work on. Prime among its recent
acquisitions is Ulu Tiram's 1,323 acres of oil palm land purchased from
Kulim Bhd.
  Despite such massive building activity in south Johor, analysts see
little possibility of a glut. Though rental rates and condominium prices
are on the downside, Johor Baru's real estate agents say that landed
property, particularly those stretching from Senai airport to the Pasir
Gudang industrial area commands a strong market. For example, a one-acre
bungalow in Advanced Development Sdn Bhd's Green Plains project in Ulu
Tiram which was selling at about RM400,000 each is now worth RM1 million,
says a broker.
  According to an analyst based in Kuala Lumpur, prices are picking up in
Johor Baru. `The recent credit restriction in Singapore which put a
squeeze on property speculation in the island may have attributed to some
of that. And there is improved accessibility - even before the second link
(in Gelang Patah) is completed they are proposing a third link at Pasir
Gudang,' he says.
  JLB has also planned several residential projects in Muar, Batu Pahat
and Malacca. Its target are new home owners, those upgrading their homes
(for example, from single-storey terrace to double-storey or bungalow) and
investors.
  Singaporean investors are keen to buy property in Malaysia despite the
RM100,000 levy for foreigners. According to news reports, a terrace house
costs as much as S$1.7 million (RM3.1 million) in Singapore, about 10
times more expensive than a terrace house in Petaling Jaya's Bandar Utama.
In addition, the recent capital gains revision in Singapore in May makes
Johor's property market much more attractive.
  Local demand for land is not lacking either as Johor is Malaysia's
fastest growing area outside the Klang Valley and Penang. The analyst
predicts more local demand because the income level in Johor is four to
five times higher than the national average. Johor Baru's population is
also forecast to grow from the present 500,000 to 700,000 by the year
2010. Johor's neighbour Malacca is also in need of more houses.
  JLB will get a further boost with its proposed listing on the main board
of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange by the end of this year. Proceeds will
be used to finance the purchase of property developer Advanced Development
Sdn Bhd from JCorp member Kulim Bhd, thus bringing the property companies
under one roof. Plantation-based Kulim Bhd owns 6,000 acres in Ulu Tiram
and now holds a 68 per cent stake in JLB. After the proposed listing,
Kulim Bhd's stake in JLB will be reduced to 51 per cent.
  Shafiqul sees scope for improvement in the property sector. He says,
`The local industry is nowhere near those you see overseas. I would like
to see more labour saved, for one.'
  In its efforts to reduce labour cost, JLB uses pre-cast concrete
supplied by its plants in Tampoi and Pasir Gudang. It also uses pre-cast
wall panelling in its buildings instead of bricks. The lighter concrete
blocks require only one worker to handle them instead of several men
needed in the conventional method.
  JLB's wholly-owned subsidiary Johor Land Manufacturing Sdn Bhd makes
about 30,000 pieces of metal door frames a year. Compared with
conventional wooden ones, metal door frames are handier and cheaper by
about 20 to 25 per cent. `They save costs and conserve timber,' says
Shafiqul.
  Another subsidiary, Pembinaan Prefabricated Sdn Bhd (PPSB), makes clay
tiles which are more durable than concrete tiles and are developers'
preferred roofing material.
  All these are a far cry from the early 70s when JCorp built wooden
quarters for army personnel in Johor Baru. The wooden houses are still in
pretty good shape today. The secret of the company's success? Shafiqul
says, `We have more buffer compared to other developers.' That buffer may
well see Johor Land beyond another 20 years.

In the corporate lane: Datuk Lee Kim Sai says he now lives a healthier and
more peaceful

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 34

SHOULD ANYONE marvel at the ease with which former Health Minister Datuk
Lee Kim Sai made the transition from politics to that of corporate
citizen, just turn the clock back to pre-independence Malaya of the 1950s.
  It's still early dawn and Kuala Lumpur's main market (now an upmarket
bazaar called Central Market) is a hive of activity. Amongst brazen
butchers and fiesty fishmongers trading  curses, a bleary-eyed 10-year-old
schoolboy carefully picks up the day's fresh produce for the family's
wholesale business. That done, he heads for the yeow char koey (deep fried
crullers - a popular breakfast staple among the Chinese) stand. He takes
on a whole basketfull which he will sell off to foodstall operators all
over Jinjang - the neighbourhood where he grew up - but this time for
personal profit.
  This pre-pubescent dabbling in business, while taking much effort and
energy, did not interfere with the boy's education. The young Lee
performed well at school and contributed towards the family finances with
his earnings. A teaching career in adulthood, followed by 30 years
dedicated to politics resulted in the business world being put on the
backburner. So when he decided not to defend his position as MCA deputy
president (a post he held since 1985) in the party's 1996 elections and
therefore gave up the cut and thrust of political life, where would he
head for next but business?
  Lee did not leave things to providence when he said goodbye to
politics.`I planned to retire when I did. I am not one to overstay my
welcome,' he says. So within two weeks of leaving politics, Lee began
corporate life when he walked into the chairman's lair of Uniwide
Corporation Sdn Bhd. Easy enough, as the company was set up by his eldest
son, Ronnie. `He had this office done up in time so that the moment I left
politics, I could walk in to my new job,' says Lee.
  Ronnie's Uniwide Corporation has interests in tower cranes and heavy
machinery. Lee also sits on the board of what he jokingly calls two-
ringgit companies. But one which certainly does not come under this
category is KLSE-listed Metro Kajang Holdings Bhd (Metro Kajang). `They
have been good to me' says Lee.
  A source of great satisfaction for Lee was that he became Metro Kajang's
chairman prior to its listing. He is especially pleased that the listing
was carried out successfully. The offer was natural as the company had
extensive property development projects in Kajang in the Hulu Langat
constituency of which he was once its member of parliament. He religiously
follows the stock price movement of this main board counter on the
Beriteks screen of the 18-inch colour television placed strategically in
his office.
  His position as chairman means he now owns equity in the company. On the
morning of the interview, Metro Kajang shares were trading at RM6.40 each.
Within the next 48 hours they rocketed past RM7.00. When asked what his
shares of Metro Kajang was worth now, Lee flashes a brilliant smile and
says, `They have been good to me.'
  Indeed, by giving up politics, Lee's personal fortunes have changed for
the better. He remembers how as minister, he was offered a bungalow lot in
one property development project near the city but he had to turn it down
because he could not afford its then prevailing market price. He says,
`Menteri tak ada duit (a minister has no money). His role is to serve the
rakyat. It's a sacrifice.'
  Does he feel being used at all, that his services are as much needed now
as they were when he was a member of parliament and a minister, with
handsome financial rewards to boot? Lee says his worth to the companies he
is involved in is based on his intimate knowledge of the ways of the
government. `The experience gained in the various ministries is invaluable
in that I know intimately the procedures involved in property development,
for instance. The knowledge, when applied properly, is a potent advantage
in business,' he says.
  What is it about the business world that he likes? `It's the certainty,
the delivery of something tangible and the subsequent quantifiable reward
for a job well done,' Lee says. Not that he did not enjoy his long sojourn
in politics. `If one enters politics wholly for altruistic reasons, then
one must accept all that political rough and tumble, the ups and downs.
For me, I enjoyed my time in politics. The work was hard but I derived a
great deal of satisfaction from being able to do a service to the nation,'
he says.
  There is an air of peace of mind and tranquility about Lee that is
translated into an excellent state of health. Standing at 5ft 9in tall and
weighing in at a healthy 150lbs, Lee cuts a dashing figure in a dark blue
suit and smooth silk tie. The secret of his health? `I am now able to
sleep right. I dream pleasant dreams. It's all so very relaxing,' he says.
Back in those political days, Lee's sleeping habits were dictated by party
meetings. Some dragged on interminably and there was many a night when he
would crawl into bed only in the wee hours of the morning.
  Then there were other people's problems for him to attend to. When he
was MP for Hulu Langat, he would be on edge every time it rained as his
consituency was flood prone. `There was a constant stream of people
knocking on my door with all manner of complaints. As their MP, I was the
obvious conduit. MPs of course should not complain as that is part of our
job specifications,' he says with the obvious clarity of one who is no
longer encumbered with such burden.
  Lee also believes in eating right. He takes heed of the advice of an old
Chinese sage who said one should eat but only up to the point of becoming
almost sated. `I only eat up to 70 per cent of capacity. I have also cut
down on sugar and salt in my diet. As a result, I feel better. I think I
look better too,' he says with an impish grin.
  If there is one thing that can drive Lee to the greatest heights of
passion,  it has to be golf. The merest mention of the `g' word during the
interview was all the cue needed to set the 16-handicapper off. `My
handicap suffered when I was in politics. One could not be seen spending
too much time on the links when there are other important party and
constituency matters to be addressed. As minister, the workload only
increased,' he says.
  Of his own prowess at the game, Lee believes he is improving. His drive
off the tee may not fly as powerfully as it used to but what he lacks for
brute strength is more than made up by accuracy. A golfing colleague
admires Lee's ability to split the fairway consistently, setting himself
up for a relatively easy second shot to reach the green with his trusty
six iron. His short game has improved and two putts into the pin for par
are often a mere formality.
  Being in business allows Lee to spend even more time on the golf course.
He sits on the board of Rawang Lakes Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Asia Pacific
Land Bhd (AP Land), as chairman. This was at the invitation of AP Land
chairman Tan Sri Low Yow Chuan, also an avid golfer. The pair would often
team up in a four-ball round of golf at the drop of a hat. `On the course
we never talk business. We are serious golfers. But back at the 19th, we
relax, gossip, talk shop and discuss aspects of our work.'
  Lim, above all, is an educationist at heart. With a Chinese education,
he felt he would be handicapped in politics without a facility for English
and Bahasa Malaysia. So he took on extra classes to equip himself in these
two languages. He was highly regarded in the Chinese community for this
fluency in what was then regarded as `foreign' tongues. A former pupil, Dr
Law Heng Neng, now the general manager of Nanyang Siang Pau, remembers an
incident at school.
  `Our female Bahasa Malaysia teacher was having a tough time trying to
explain a particularly abstract concept to our class one day. She tried to
explain what mesyuwarah (consensus) meant to us 15-year-olds without much
success.
  `Nearing the end of her tether, she marched out of the class and headed
for the staffroom. She returned with Lee in tow. Without much effort, Lee
came up with a one-word translation in Mandarin and everyone broke into an
applause,' he says. To this day, Lee firmly believes in the power of
education as a tool for anyone to rise above their station.
  Lee has indeed had an illustrious political career. In government he has
held three Cabinet posts. He became labour minister in 1986, housing and
local government minster three years later and health minister in 1990.
  He has never lost in  general elections stretching back to the first
time he contested the Rawang state seat in 1974. In 1993, Lee made the
announcement that he would not defend his Hulu Langat parliamentary seat
in the 1995 elections. His political fate was earlier sealed when he led
the group which mounted a challenge against Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik
for the party presidency in 1990. Lee pulled out at the 11th hour but
continued to be at loggerheads with Ling.
  Lee's place in the annals of MCA politics is assured. That even those
who once crossed swords with him refuse to condemn him in public at least
is a measure of how much Lee's contribution towards building the party
means to them and the community at large. He may have made the inevitable
enemy or two throughout his political career and the grudge they harbour
may well remain festering.
  `But I don't let that worry me. I can look back at my career with a
clear conscience. I am happy,' says Lee with sanguine finality.
 

Pix: Lee: I can look back at my career with a clear conscience.

Pix: Lee: I planned to retire when I did. I am not one to overstay my
welcome.

A marriage of convenience: A rattan furniture company successfully marries
form and function to giv

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 33

POH MAY Holdings Bhd first exported rattan furniture in the midst of a
recession. `Collection and sales were poor. I hadn't reached a critical
stage yet but I was looking for markets,' recalls managing director
Geoffrey Lee. `But exports was a different game. We knocked on doors, went
from embassy to embassy, taking product shots and filling out formal
applications for our products. It was very hard.'
  As it turned out, the pay-offs were handsome. Today, 80 per cent of the
Penang-based group's furniture are exported to England, Ireland, the
United States and Europe. In these markets, rattan is upmarket, trendy and
very popular. Nearly 60 per cent of Poh May's furniture is rattan-based.
  While small in comparison with the likes of Federal Furniture, Land and
General and other listed timber-based furniture makers, business for Poh
May has snowballed in recent times. From five workers during the mid-80s,
Poh May's six subsidiary companies today employ a total of 800 in two main
factories and six showrooms.
  The two factories are at Parit Buntar, Perak and Klang. More showrooms
are in the pipeline. Lee says, `We emphasize innovation and design rather
than the traditional furniture. It's more interesting.'
  To expand and compete internationally, Poh May is seeking a listing on
the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Poh May's
listing involves a new issue of 4.51 million shares at RM2.90 each. Of
this, 3.27 million shares will be for the Malaysian public. The remaining
1.24 million shares will be reserved for subscription by approved
Bumiputera investors. Says Lee,`If everything goes well, we should list by
early next year.'
  Poh May forecasts a group pre-tax profit of RM7.48 million for its
FY1996 on a group turnover of RM58 million. For FY1997 it forecasts a
profit and turnover of RM13.47 million and RM84.9 million, respectively.
(Refer to Table 1.)
  Poh May is the first local furniture company to apply wood-bending, a
technique by which straight pieces of hardwood are curved in a mechanised
steamer process. The result - elegant and aesthetically pleasing pieces of
furniture. In fact, the Bendwood furniture is the only one of its kind in
Malaysia, although some makers in Taiwan and Europe have the know-how.
  Says Lee,`You can bend cane and metal, but you can't bend wood, least of
all hardwood. But we came out with the technology and the skills. No one
in Southeast Asia has been able to copy that yet,' he smiles.
  The company is adept at combining rattan with wrought iron and metal in
producing new furniture products. Any combination is possible, so long as
the end-product looks good enough. He says, `One new range of furniture is
launched every year to keep up with market demand.'
  Lee, a winner of entrepreneurial awards here and abroad, keeps a close
eye on local talent. Among Poh May's newer products to use indigenous
technology is the Igloo, a refrigeration unit which uses a locally
patented microchip cooling system instead of a generator or compressor,
thus saving energy and reducing noise level. This is incorporated into
furniture for use in the office or bedside. (Refer Table 2 for Poh May
subsidiaries and their main activities.)
  `For a feel of the market, we travel all over to see what other parts of
the world have to offer. We go to Europe and to the United States where
the biggest furniture market is. There we learn something, come back and
try it out. But we don't copy. We get an idea and develop it further,'
says Lee.
  The search for cheaper materials is also important. Poh May plans to set
up a timber-based factory in Cao Danang, an economic processing zone in
southern Vietnam, to take advantage of cheap timber and wood sources.
  The overall demand for rattan and wood furniture remains buoyant.
Malaysia's exports of rattan and wood furniture are expected to increase
to RM3 billion by the year 2000. It is expected to rise to RM2 billion by
next year.
  Lee explains, `Everyone knows the housing industry is booming, people's
incomes are rising... the furniture market is still good. It's a case of
how good you are. I emphasize design and innovation, so rather than talk
about a chair, we talk about a piece of furniture.'
  Lee explains his early move into furniture. `When I was in Form 3, my
father retired from trucking and ventured into cane furniture in a very
small way. He set up a joint venture, a small shop to do cane furniture.
We were poor so I helped out after school. After finishing Form 5, I
studied  one more year in Penang at a private institute for my higher
accounting. Then I worked for a year as an accounts clerk. I was about 21
when I went into this business.
  `At that time I called it Lee Trading. We started in a small way with
little capital. I did very basic cane furniture to supply the Penang
market. Slowly we grew. Our furniture was sent down to Kuala Lumpur and
the East Coast.'
  Then came tough times during the 1985-1986 recession. Lee decided to
look outside Malaysia. It made sense as Lee felt that the local market was
not big enough for his company to expand and enjoy economies of scale in
production.
  But this does not mean he will concentrate on exports alone. `I would
say that the local market has very good potential for growth. I am very
optimistic about the local furniture market. Of course, I cannot deny that
our costs in Malaysia have increased compared to a couple of years back,
but in Europe they are having bigger problems. The margins for us here are
higher.'

A milestone for reinsurer: MNRB plans to go into underwriting risks for
aircraft and satellites

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 14

AS THE COUNTRY'S sole reinsurer, Malaysian National Reinsurance Bhd (MNRB)
enjoys a certain degree of monopoly.
  But unlike other monopolies such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd or Telekom
Malaysia, MNRB has had to strive hard to carve this monopoly into a
meaningful revenue earner. This is because basically, the profits of
reinsurance companies depend on the performance of the insurance companies
ceding part of their premiums to the former. In MNRB's case, its
bottomline is therefore affected by the fate of local insurance companies.
  Until 1984, the local insurance industry was far from orderly and
considered a demerit market by foreign reinsurance companies. `Many
insurance companies indulged in unhealthy competition with each other for
business. There was no control ... of course we had the insurance laws and
a lot of people just looked at the law and got away or tried to get away
with it. As a result, the Malaysian market was severely affected by
underwritng losses and uncontrollable cost,' says MNRB's managing director
Anuar Mohd Hassan.
  Following the disorder that reigned in the industry, market players
through the General Insurance Association of Malaysia (GIAM) came out with
a series of inter-company agreements. MNRB, which was closely linked to
GIAM, also played a key role in ensuring the agreement was adhered to for
the viability of the industry.
  Says Anuar, `With all the efforts by parties concerned, including
insurance companies themselves who wanted to be regulated, the market
improved. Malaysia was no longer considered a demerit market but instead
one where many reinsurers worldwide wanted to be involved with. The
companies started producing underwriting profits and this had a direct
impact on profits of MNRB.'
  In a way therefore, the listing of MNRB on the main board of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) heralds another step in the long road to
recovery of the Malaysian insurance industry. Incorporated in 1972, MNRB
is offering 19.06 million shares to the public at RM4.30 per share. After
listing, its share capital will increase to RM189.7 million. Thanks to
Malaysia not being subjected to catastrophic perils, the company has
chalked up handsome pre-tax profits the past few years. (See table)
  For the financial year ended March 31, 1996, MNRB recorded a pre-tax
profit of RM61.52 million while the forecast for 1997 is RM77.92 million.
The net tangible asset backing per share is RM1.69 while the earnings per
share based on its forecast net profit of RM54.5 million for 1997 is 29
sen. Given the initial public offer price of RM4.30 per share, MNRB shares
are being offered at a prospective price earnings multiple of 14.8 times
FY97 earnings. Given the average sectoral price earnings multiple of 24
times, MNRB's shares should trade at around RM7.
  MNRB's revenue comprises premium income and investment income. For the
past five years, premiums contributed about 90 per cent of income with the
remaining 10 per cent coming from investment income. Over 80 per cent of
the premium income of MNRB is derived from the voluntary cessions of the
entire Malaysian general insurance market while the balance comes from
facultative and treaty reinsurance.
  The voluntary cessions, structured and implemented on Jan 1, 1973, is a
form of proportional treaty reinsurance between MNRB and local insurance
companies. The agreement entered with local insurance companies require a
share of their business to be ceded to MNRB. In return, MNRB covers
damages in proportion to the premium ceded. Part of the voluntary cessions
is retroceded to the ceding companies with the objective of helping
prevent premium outflow and to help local insurance companies build up
premium volume from a well spread portfolio of risks.
  The amount of business ceded to MNRB ranges from 10 per cent to 15 per
cent. The voluntary cessions agreement provides MNRB with a steady stream
of income, causing several analysts to be optimistic of the steady
earnings the company will get in the future.
  However, an analyst ponders on what is to become of the voluntary
cessions agreement with the liberalisation of world trade and services
through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World Trade
Organisation (WTO) in the next few years.
  To this, MNRB senior general manager Mustaffa Ahmad explains that he
does not expect MNRB or the agreements with the local insurance companies
to be a subject of contention under GATT and WTO. `As long as it is not a
compulsory arrangement, there should not be any questions. The agreement
was agreed by all parties,' he says.
  Anuar explains that the voluntary cessions agreement was last reviewed
last year and the percentage ceded was supposed to be further reduced in
January this year. `However, with the declining trend of the national
retention ratio, the board of MNRB together with the industry agreed that
there should be no change in the level of voluntary cessions for this
year, he says.
  According to the 1994 Director-General of Insurance Report, the national
retention ratio was 72.3 per cent while the government wants to see the
retention ratio move up to 85 per cent. Anuar says no date has been fixed
for the next review of the voluntary cessions agreement.
  `There is no specific date for the agreement. It has to be agreed upon
by all parties which are the industry, MNRB and Bank Negara. I do not
expect it to be done every year,' he says.
  Another concern among analysts is the rather flat net profits showed by
the company since 1995. This, according to a company official, is because
MNRB has been very prudent in forecasting its claims ratio. `In addition,
the more risk we write, the more we have to set aside as unexpired premium
reserve,' he says.
  With a guaranteed stream of steady income, what is the future of MNRB
with more foreign reinsurance companies given the nod to set up operations
here? At present there are seven other reinsurance companies in Malaysia.
Six of them are incorporated outside Malaysia. The other is the Malaysian
Re International Insurance (MIIL) which is incorporated in Labuan. MNRB
has a 20 per cent equity interest in MIIL. Anuar says MNRB is looking at
writing more offshore business with foreign companies. `We not happy to
sit here and wait for offers to come here through intermediaries,'
stresses Anuar. `We want to be involved in Asean countries where many
reinsurers are interested due to the phenomenal economic boom. We are also
looking at North Africa and the Middle-East countries.
  `There is a great desire from some countries in that region to have
business dealings in Malaysia, not only because our country is on the
world map but because they have heard of MNRB's reputation of assisting
and improving local insurance companies. It is also due to the financial
strength of MNRB and its desire to work with another Muslim company.
Besides that, we are also looking at India,' he says.
  On the local front, Anuar says MNRB will take over the management of the
aviation pool which will have the capacity to underwrite a certain portion
of risks involving aircraft. `We cannot underwrite 100 per cent of MAS
planes but the pool will at least be able to underwrite the smaller
aircraft. A substantial amount of premiums involving such large risks is
going out of the country at the moment,' he says.
  From planes, MNRB plans to move into underwriting risks for satellites.
Anuar says MNRB is discussing with an experienced foreign reinsurance firm
on the matter.

Pix: Mustafa: It's not a compulsory arrangement.

Pricier than the norm: But given its profitability, analysts think that's
a fair IPO price for

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 12

EVERMASTER GROUP Bhd's flotation exercise has drawn keen interest amongst
market players. Reason: the shares are being offered at RM7, the second
highest ever for a second board listing after Penas Corporation Bhd.
  Clearly, the company has taken the cue from the Securities Commission
(SC) urging companies to move from a merit-based environment to one of
full disclosure. This means it is the company and not the authorities who
determine the initial public offer (IPO) price.
  Comments an analyst,`Beginning 1996, the SC left it up to the merchant
bankers to decide on the IPO of a company. In this case, Commerce
International Merchant Bankers Bhd has set the scale based on the market
sentiments. At present, second board sentiments are generally positive so
the pricing of Evermaster shares probably reflects this scenario.
Sometimes, we see shares hitting a opening price of more than RM7 upon
listing.'
  Is the RM7 justified?
  According to estimates, Evermaster's net earnings per share (EPS) pre-
listing is 76.3 sen which will rise to a post-listing 80.2 sen FY1996
earnings. The forecast figures for 1997 include a RM102 million turnover
and a RM14.5 million pre-tax profit.
  Based on the 1996 post-listing EPS, the shares are being offered at a
historical price earnings (PE) multiple of 8.8 times. This is around the
average net PE most IPOs are priced at.
  Managing director Tsai Ching Chi maintains the RM7 is based on the
company's historical and forecast earnings. Is it expected to fetch a huge
premium on opening day like other second board counters? `We do not know
what the premium will be, but we hope it will be similar to others in the
industry,' he says.
  Says one analyst, `It would  seem that given the company's
profitability, the RM7 IPO price is not high at all. In fact, the
shareholders could have opted for a higher paid-up capital of say RM30
million, instead of its RM20 million, which would have given a lower EPS
and thus lower IPO price. After all, you can still go for a listing on the
second board on a paid-up capital of up to RM40 million.'
  Tsai says the prospectus will be issued by mid- November and the listing
is scheduled by the end of the year. Pursuant to the listing, the main
shareholders of Sabah-based Evermaster are making an offer for sale of
five million shares at RM7 each. Of these, two million are for bumiputera
investors, 851,000 shares for Evermaster eligible employees and the
remaining 2.149 million for the public.
  Although Evermaster is in the timber business, it does not own any
timber concessions. But the company maintains this is not a reason for
concern. Its log supplies are sourced under various agreements with
concessionaires and direct purchases from suppliers in the open market. It
even has long term supply agreements with third parties with concession
periods ranging from eight to 10 years.
  Evermaster was set up in 1986 as a company trading primarily in timber
logs by three founder members - managing director Tsai and executive
directors Lim Piak How and Yek Lik Hua. Following the listing, Tsai, Lim
and Yek will each hold a 15.3 per cent stake while chairman Hamzah
Zainudin will own 20 per cent.
  Prior to 1986, Tsai, who is a Taiwanese with permanant residence status
in Sabah, was involved in timber and forestry for more than 30 years. In
the course of work, he met up with his current partners, both Sabahans.
Lim was a surveyor with vast experience in timber extraction, while Yek's
forte is in marketing and shipping timber. `Each of us has vast experience
in specialised areas and it was only logical that we teamed up and used
our expertise in our own operations,' says Tsai.
  Evermaster Wood Products Sdn Bhd was established two years later in 1988
to take advantage of the government's incentives. Evermaster Wood produces
sawn timber and veneer as value added products and has 780 employees.
  Through its two subsidiaries, Evermaster Wood and Evermaster Sdn Bhd
(trading in timber logs), Evermaster derives 95 per cent of its turnover
from overseas markets, mainly Japan, South Korea and China. Major
customers for plywood include the China National Trading Corporation Ltd,
Momura Trading Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corporation Co Ltd and Northeast
Materials Ltd. Sawn timber is exported to Nisho Iwai International (S)
Ltd, Takahide Corporation and Anrobis Trading Pte Ltd.
  The remaining five per cent of the group's turnover comes from supplying
its products in Sabah itself. Evermaster products are marketed under the
brand label `Green Frog'. Why this name? Tsai explains, `Most of our
products are exported to the Asia-Pacific region, particularly to China
and Taiwan where people prefer the names of animals as brand names.
  `Although Evermaster deals with timber we want people to know that we
are not destroying the environment. So we came up with the Green Frog,
which signifies life and preservation,' he smiles.
  The Evermaster Group operates from its timber complex covering 53 acres
in Keningau, Sabah. The facility has four production lines each for veneer
and plywood, operating on two 10-hour shifts a day. There is one
production line for sawn timber operating on one shift of 10 hours a day.
  According to Tsai, the total investment in fixed assets for the two
subsidiaries to date stands at RM50 million. The total production capacity
for plywood is 78,000 cubic metres per year and 18,000 cubic metres per
year for sawn timber.
  Tsai is emphatic that the demand for timber products will continue to
grow, particularly in Asia-Pacific countries with high growth rates. `The
dominant players in the Asia-Pacific region are China and Japan. If these
economies continue to grow, we believe Evermaster's prospects will be very
good,' he says.
  Evermaster is pegged as one of the top 10 exporters in terms of export
earnings from Sabah, Tsai claims. He does say, however, that no
comparative studies have been conducted.
  What plans does Evermaster have? `We plan to expand into downstream
activities such as finger-jointed wood, laminated boards, profiles and
blackboards as well as kiln drying,' says Tsai. The group is set to invest
RM16 million to construct a new plant adjacent to its existing plant in
Keningau to manufacture new downstream products. Work on the new factory
will begin in January next year.
  Other areas being considered for expansion include manufacturing of
furniture to add value to existing products. Evermaster will also venture
into other markets in Europe and United States.
  The group has been registering a steady increase in turnover and profits
over the last five years (see table).

The profits of peace: Malaysian investors get a head start in southern
Philippines

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 71

THE PHILIPPINE economy is heading for better times. Exports have grown,
domestic consumption is rising and inflation is down to nine per cent. An
added bonus is the signing of the peace treaty on Sept 2 that ended 24
years of war in southern Philippines.
  Though the Philippines is still far from catching up with the economies
of the Asian `dragons', analysts say with political stability and skilled
manpower, the country could outpace its present six to seven per cent
growth in the next few years.
  In keeping with global trend, the Philippines is shifting away from
traditional family-dominated monopolies to a free market system,
emphasising the development of basic infrastructure.
  Last year, private sector investments amounted to 335.3 billion pesos.
Priority is given to build, operate, transfer (BOT) projects.
  The free market shift is also aiding the tourism industry, traditionally
the Philippines' major foreign exchange earner. Intense competition among
four airlines - Air Philippines, Grand Pacific, Cebu Pacific Airlines and
the national flag carrier Philippines Airlines - is bringing down air
fares.
  Services contributed to 43 per cent of the gross domestic product last
year and the government is opening the banking sector to foreign
competition. Under the foreign bank liberalisation law, foreign investors
can buy a controlling stake of up to 60 per cent in a local bank. The
Central Bank's previous ceiling on foreign ownership was 40 per cent.
  A recent report by the Central Bank governor shows that foreign banks'
share of the total resources of the Philippine commercial banking system
increased from 6.95 per cent last year to 8.17 per cent as of March 1996.
With the Central Bank issuing new licences, there are now 42 banks
compared to 24 in 1991.
  Malaysian corporations are among those to take advantage of the
investment opportunities in the Philippines. Four Malaysian joint ventures
are involved in the BOT projects planned for 1996-2000. Renong Bhd is
developing the Manila Cavite Expressway worth 6.5 billion pesos (RM650
million); Philippine Malaysia Water Consortium is undertaking the South
Metro Manila Water Supply project worth 312 million pesos; Malaysian
Philippines Utilities Sdn Bhd is building the Balara Water Treatment
Plant; and Johan Holdings Bhd is involved in a BOT project valued at 4.16
billion pesos.
  According to the Board of Investments, Malaysian-led projects rank
fourth among all BOI-approved investments in the Philippines. Regionally,
they form the biggest investor group. Last year the BOI-regulated
investments from Malaysia was 1.59 billion pesos. The Malaysian companies
went into manufacturing, construction, property development and the
services sectors in the early 90s and are now expanding, mostly into
resource-rich but underdeveloped Mindanao island in southern Philippines.
  Even before the peace pact between the Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front last September, Malaysian, Indonesian and
Hong Kong investors have ventured to Mindanao. They invested in the
banking, telecommunications, steel, tourism, liquified petroleum gas
(LPG), water supply, property, palm oil/rubber, coconut processing,
banking and property sectors.
  Most of these companies gained a foothold in the Philippines during the
1992-1993 period when President Fidel Ramos' government sped up market
reforms initiated by his predecessor Corazon Aquino. The early birds
include Westmont Group's Westmont Bank, Berjaya Group, Hong Leong Group,
Waterfront International, Kuok Group, Johan Holdings, Petronas, Hume
Industries, Rashid Hussein Bhd, TA Securities Bhd, Auto Industries Sdn Bhd
and the Lion Group.
  Proton recently completed a plant in Pengasinan in Luzon which will
start producing cars after the Apec (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)
meeting in Subic this month. Metroplex Bhd and Genting Bhd are developing
hotels and a casino in Subic. Westmont Bank, reputed to be among the top
10 commercial banks, is the result of a takeover and rescue bid by
Westmont group in 1994. Arab-Malaysian Banking Corp, Bank Bumiputra,
Malayan Banking and Bank Islam are among the latest investors in Mindanao.
  Undoubtedly, the inflow of foreign investments is fuelling the
Philippines' economic recovery. But the real challenge now is to ensure
that the benefits of the recovery trickle down to ordinary Filipinos. An
Asian diplomat based in Manila says, `Normally with economic growth there
is decline in unemployment, but you don't see that so clearly. The
implication is that economic recovery is benefiting only certain sectors.'
  The jobless rate is nine per cent and between 30 and 35 per cent of
Filipinos are underemployed, notes the diplomat. (The underemployed are
those holding part-time jobs). In addition an estimated four million
Filipinos are working overseas, 90 per cent of whom are classified as
`vulnerable'. The vulnerable groups include domestic servants and
unskilled workers who are the hardest to monitor and encounter the most
problems. In recent years, the robust economy has helped to reduce
unemployment but more needs to be done.
  Says Philippines' ambassdor to Malaysia Jose S Brilliantes, `Even if
they are not coming home in droves, there is a perceptible improvement
now'. Undersecretary of the Board of Investment Melito Sison Salazar Jr
notes, `In general job migration is an outward rather than an inward flow.
Though employment opportunities have improved somewhat, this is offset by
the rising cost of living that still drives many Filipinos to seek better
paying jobs overseas.'
  The immigration laws have been tightened and the government is now
sponsoring re-orientation programmes and investment schemes to assist
workers returning to the Philippines.
  As capital-hungry Filipino businesses look to tie up with foreign
partners, there is great potential for technology transfer and the
development of human resources. Wages have increased but they are still
lower than other countries in the region. Wages in the manufacturing
sector increase by about 9.5 per cent annually. However, income at the top
is among the most respectable. A study by Hong Kong's Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd shows that the salaries of professionals in
managerial and production positions in the Philippines are among the top
in the region.
  Brilliantes says labour is no longer cheap in the Philippines. `One of
the comparative advantages in investing in the Philippines is not in low
wages but in its human resources, the availability of a large pool of
highly trainable, skilled, English-speaking manpower,' he says.

The perks of the trade: Samsung workers enjoy living standards better than
most

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 23

LIKE their brethren across the nation, Seremban factory workers have been
infected by the malady of quitting their employers for higher-paying
offers elsewhere.
  Lately, a number of engineers and technicians from certain Seremban-
based plants have been lured to Samsung Seremban, drawn by higher pay and
better perks. Although the brain-drain has not reached a critical level
yet, the outflow of talent from a particular electronics company has its
management so worried, that a top executive requested Samsung Malaysia
president and managing director Kim Jin Ki not to pay such high salaries.
  Does Samsung pay the most among Seremban industrial facilities? `We are
among the highest,' says Kim. `But whether we are the highest I do not
know.'
  `They pay the best rates. Not that much more, about four to five hundred
more per month,' affirms a senior engineer with the rival electronics
manufacturer. `But they also work you the hardest.'
  At the Samsung Electronics Seremban Complex, 12-hour shifts are the
norm. Where executive engineers are concerned, overtime can only be
claimed after working 20 hours. And, adds the senior engineer, `They like
you to take overtime.'
  However, the long hours are cushioned by a cornucopia of employee
benefits. Workers are entitled to 26 free meals a month, and can choose
from five to seven different menus at the company cafeterias. Reflecting
Samsung's heritage, Korean food - albeit tailored to Malaysian tastebuds -
is available. Judging by the long line at the counter, the Korean dishes
go down well with Samsung workers.
  Free meals are complemented by lodging - gratis also - at the company's
custom-built dormitories. Costing RM17.5 million, the dormitories consist
of four blocks, with another two to be completed in May 1997. Also on the
cards are a swimming pool, gymnasium (offering free recreational classes)
and football field.
  Says K K Lee, self-styled resort director at Samsung Dormitory, `As far
as I know, this is the first (dormitory) of its kind. A test case where
residences are within the industrial area.'
  The concept seems to have found favour with Samsung employees.
Currently, the occupancy rate is 90 per cent, which works out to some
2,000 residents, including 500 Indonesians. Expectedly, males and females
are segregated in their own blocks. Each block has 96 rooms, with four
occupants per room. Facilities are basic, with each room featuring spartan
double-decker bunk beds and wardrobes. Just like a college dormitory,
there are common areas - TV rooms, reading rooms, prayer rooms and laundry
rooms - as well as communal shower areas. The pantry features moulded
plastic seats and tables, just like in fast-food restaurants.
  Thanks to his military background, K K Lee runs the place `barracks-
style', assisted by his wardens. There are strict rules - a curfew of 12
midnight is strictly enforced for employees `who are not out of station'
and smoking is prohibited.
  Despite the regimentation, says K K Lee, `There's a waiting list to get
in.' This is hardly surprising, since staying in the dormitory would
enable a worker to shave his monthly living expenses considerably. Rentals
in Seremban and surrounding areas have been escalating steadily, with a
single-storey terrace house going for RM250 on the average.
  The question is - has Samsung's employee benefits programme actually
boosted its ability to retain staff? Employee turnover is pretty low, says
Kim, about three per cent monthly compared to the national monthly average
of six per cent.  But staff retention comes at a hefty cost. On a micro
level, says Lee, Samsung spends RM100-odd per month on each dormitory
resident. Multiply that figure by 2,000 residents and Samsung's monthly
dormitory bill is a steep RM200,000. But that's not all. Each month, says
Kim, the expense of maintaining the employee benefit programme is `at a
one-to-one ratio' with Samsung's wage bill.

Roads to roam: The Western Australian Education Centre shows you several
ways of gettin

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 64

AUSTRALIA has plenty to offer - excellent weather, a cost of living which
most consider reasonable, is culturally diverse and has an education
system considered among the best Down Under.
  And Perth is the Australian city most students, Malaysians or others,
head for in furtherance of their education. Over 10,000 international
students are currently enrolled in Perth's various educational
institutions, many of whom are from Malaysia.
  A substantial number of them have sought the services of the Western
Australian Education Centre in Kuala Lumpur for assistance in getting
places at the many Perth institutions of higher learning. There are four
universities in the Perth region - Curtin University of Technology, Edith
Cowan University, Murdoch University and the University of Western
Australia.
  All are large government-funded universities which provide a wide range
of degree courses from bachelor to doctorate level. And all are of
international standing and repute, with their degrees enjoying
international recognition.
  Overseas students have the option of pursuing their secondary education
by enrolling in a number of government- or private-sector colleges. They
offer courses from Year 7 to Year 12 (final year). Entry to university is
based on the results of the Tertiary Entrance Examination which are the
Year 12 examinations under the Western Australian Education system.
  But for those who find the method of entry to university rigid, there is
an alternative secondary system provided by Canning College, Tuart
College, Beaufort College, Edwards College and St Marks International
College. These colleges offer the Western Australian Universities
Foundation Programme in association with the four government universities.
This programme has been designed for international students and is an
alternative to Year 12. All universities accept the results of the
Foundation Programme for University entrance.
  In the vocational area there are a number of government and private
colleges which offer courses for international students. The government
provider is Tafe (Technical and Further Education) which is the largest
educational provider in Western Australia with over 100,000 students. Tafe
offers a wide range of courses at vocational and technical level in most
areas of study. Students who complete a Tafe diploma in some of these
areas (notably business and engineering) are eligible for entry to most
Western Australian universities with advanced standing.
  The private providers in the vocational field include Alexander College,
Edwards College, Australian Institute of University Studies (AIUS), Perth
Institute of Business and Technology (PIBT), and Perth Commercial College.
These colleges tend to focus on courses in business, computing, mass
communications, travel and tourism, hospitality studies and secretarial
studies.
  Admission requirements are flexible and some also have a three semester
calender year which means there are three intakes a year for the various
programmes. The system also allows students to complete a programme of
study in a shorter period of time.
  Alexander College, Edwards College, AIUS and PIBT also have arrangements
with the Western Australian universities whereby the former offer courses
equivalent to the first (and in some courses second and third) year of the
degree programmes in business/commerce, computing and mass communications.
  Upon successful completion of these programmes, students are able to
enrol directly into the second year (and where applicable later years) of
the relevant degree programmes of the universities. These courses provide
an excellent alternative for students who are marginally unable to gain
direct entry to the university course of their choice.
  For students and parents keen to learn more about the programmes offered
by the various Perth institutions of higher learning, they can visit the
Western Australian Education Centre in Kuala Lumpur.
  The centre is located at 4th floor, UBN Tower, 10, Jalan P Ramlee, 50250
Kuala Lumpur. They can make an appointment or even seek information from
centre officials by telephone at 03-2321248/9.

Seeking only the best: High calibre multiple partners help IMC maintain
high standards

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 66

WHEN THE International Medical College (IMC) chose the University of
Melbourne Medical School as its 20th partner medical school, it knew it
had made the right decision.
  The reason is simple - the University Of Melbourne Medical School is the
oldest medical school in Australia. It is also widely dubbed as the
Oxbridge of Down Under for its high standard. The Dean of IMC, Professor
John S Beck says, `This is a very good choice and we are immensely proud
to have this university as our partner medical school.'
  The University of Melbourne Medical School only became IMC's partner
medical school last year, three years after it started.
  The reason behind the slight delay in getting an Australian university
as one of its medical partners was because IMC was not familiar with the
standard of Australian universities as well as their curriculum.
  Beck says, `Once we had examined the curriculum and spoken to their
students, we concluded that their standard was high and just as good as
ours. So we went into a partnership with them. The University of Melbourne
has offered six places to students of IMC.'
  The IMC is looking for more Australian partners. `The IMC is also
building ties with other universities in Australia We are very careful in
selecting partner medical schools as we only want the best because here at
IMC, our standards are equally high,' adds Beck.
  Beck says one of the reasons why IMC is looking favourably at
universities Down Under is because Australia has become a natural focus
for sudents in this region. `People here always perceive Australia as
being nearer to home than any other country. Europe and North America are
considered as being too far away.'
  The University of Melbourne Medical School was the first medical school
established in Australia - that was in 1862, 11 years after the university
formally opened.
  The school attracts many of the best students in Australia and overseas.
  Over the last 10 years it has attracted more research funding than any
other medical school in Australia. Its ability to attract a leading share
of Australia's largest pool of government and privately-funded health and
medical research opportunities continues to draw research talent of the
highest calibre.
  The teaching hospital network offers outstanding experience for students
in their clinical years. Associated with the medical school are five major
general teaching hospitals: the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Western
Hospital, St Vincent's Hospital, Geelong Hospital, Austin and Repatriation
Medical Centre.
  Major specialist teaching hospitals are the Royal Children's Hospital,
Royal Women's Hospital, Mercy Hospital for Women, the Royal Victorian Eye
and Ear Hospital, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, North-West
Hospital and Fairfeild Hospital for Infectious disease.
  Students who join the IMC can complete their MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine
and Bachelor of Surgery) in six years - 2ystem at the college and 3ystem years 
in Melbourne. The tuition fee in Melbourne is A$24,000 per annum.
  The IMC curriculum consists of two parts - Part 1 comprises 2ystem years of
training supervised by the Faculty of the International Medical College in
basic biomedical science and an integrated clinical systems-centred
course.
  The Advanced Diploma in Medical Sciences will be awarded by the college
to students who have successfully completed their programme of study at
the IMC.
  The IMC approach introduces clinical experience from the start of the
curriculum and this helps the student to appreciate the real importance of
the basic science since its application is clearly presented. First year
students will receive clinical exposure at the Seremban General Hospital,
Port Dickson Hospital and various community health clinics in Seremban.
  The college accepts Malaysian and international students who have
completed their Australian Matriculation examinations.
  Todate, the college has some 100 students who have completed various
Australian matriculation programmes such as the South Australian
Matriculation, Victoria Certificate Of Education, the New South Wales
Foundation and Queensland Matriculation. IMC also accepts students with
Monash University Foundation Year qualifications.
  The other 19 partner medical schools of the IMC are University of
Auckland in New Zealand, University College Cork, University College
Dublin, University Galway, the Royal College of Surgeons and Trinity
College in Ireland, University Of Alberta, University Of Calgary,
Daihousie University, McGill University, Memorial University Of
Newfoundland, University Of Western Ontario, and Thomas Jefferson Medical
College In North America, University Of Aberdeen, University Of Dundee,
University Of Glasgow, University Of Liverpool, University Of Newcastle
Upon-Tyne and Queen's University In the United Kingdom.

Stage set for the next century: The 1997 Budget lays a foundation for a
technologically sophisticated

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 40

IN A 90 MINUTE speech at the Dewan Rakyat on Oct 25, Finance Minister
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim described his Budget as laying the foundation to
establish a `firm bridge' to take Malaysia into the 21st century. What is
in store for 1997?
  Notwithstanding a drop in the electronics industry, the Malaysian
economy is expected to surge ahead at an estimated GDP growth rate of 8.2
per cent for this year. This represents the ninth consecutive year of
robust growth of more than eight per cent per annum for the country.
Consequently, the per capita income has correspondingly increased from
RM10,058 in 1995 to RM11,118 for this year.
  What has confounded sceptics is the fact that the strong economic growth
has been accompanied by low inflation, a proud achievement for the country
indeed. For 1996, for instance, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected
to rise a mere 0.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent last year,
helping to allay fears of an economy overheating.
  Besides stable prices, the other commendable feature of the economic
growth this year is the healthy rise in national savings from 36.5 per
cent in 1995 to 38.8 per cent for 1996. This places the savings rate in
Malaysia higher than Japan and all the other newly industrialising
economies (NIEs), with the exception of Singapore.
  At the same time, the capital market is further boosted by a record
listing of 61 companies from January to September this year, turning the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange into the third largest bourse in the Asia
Pacific region.
  In the manufacturing sector, domestic-oriented industries grew at a
healthy rate of 15.2 per cent for the first seven months this year as
compared to 12.8 per cent over the same period a year ago. Except for the
electronics sector, all other export-oriented industries, especially
textiles, wood and rubber products, posted significant growth.
  In its rush to catch up with the other NIEs, Malaysia has recently been
facing a current account deficit compounded by a persistent and
deteriorating service account. With a breakneck pace of growth in recent
years, the country is also experiencing full employment and capacity
utilisation with a resultant increase in inflationary pressures both in
terms of wages and costs.
  Recognising the need to further strengthen the structure of the economy
as well as address the weaknesses associated with a long period of growth,
the 1997 Budget, with a total expenditure of RM59.98 billion, has been
drawn up to ensure sustained growth in the medium and long term by:
  * Achieving sustainable growth through enhanced productivity;
  * Strengthening the balance of payments position with improvements in
the services sector and higher domestic production; and
  * Strengthening the agenda for social development.
  Presently, more than half (55 per cent) of the growth in output derives
from capital investment making the ratio of investment to GNP a high of
45.1 per cent. While this is laudable, the whole approach to development
would have to undergo a major shift from being capital driven to
productivity driven if Malaysia were to enjoy a higher level of
sustainable growth. The emphasis on productivity growth is clearly
emboldened in the Seventh Malaysia Plan as shown in the table.
  In this regard, appropriate measures have been announced in the Budget
to steer the economy in the right direction. To encourage manufacturing
and agricultural firms to modernise operations, expand capacity and
diversify output, a reinvestment allowance of 100 per cent of statutory
income is granted for productivity boosting investments.
  Underscoring its commitment to upgrade the high level of technology, the
Budget has allocated RM721 million for the Technology Development Plan and
research programmes like the IRPA (Intensification of Research in Priority
Areas). To encourage more research and development work, private
companies, especially the small and medium industries (SMIs), are allowed
to use the IRPA's allocation. Firms are also allowed double deduction for
R&D expenditures. Tax deduction for the acquisition of intangible assets
like patents, designs and trade marks would help the country in scaling up
the technology ladder rapidly.
  Besides enhancing the value chain of the manufacturing process, the new
Industry Inter-Linkage Programme (ILP) also helps to promote cooperation
and transfer of skills and technology from multinational corporations to
local industries. In addition, SMIs participating in the ILP and producing
quality intermediate goods, are given tax exemption for up to 10 years.
  The Budget also has generous incentives to help promote a strategic
shift to knowledge-based and technology intensitive industries. This move
will undoubtedly help to improve efficiency and productivity in all areas.
Of particular mention is the slew of incentives to give the Multi-Media
Super Corridor (MSC) a further boost. Among such incentives are:
  * Pioneer status for 10 years for Investment Tax Allowance of 100 per
cent for a new company;
  * Exemption of taxes on all multi-media equipment;
  * Allowing the recruitment of expatriates according to needs; and
  * Special guidelines for transactions and loans in foreign currency.
  The Budget has also not forgotten the human resource development
necessary to make the upgrading of technology a success. A whopping
allocation of RM13.2 billion or more than 20 per cent of the Budget has
been provided to upgrade and expand local educational and training
institutions and to promote a large pool of technicians and engineers.
  A 50 per cent income tax exemption is also allowed for foreign lecturers
and foreign educational institutions set up in Malaysia, a much needed
boost to the country's effort to establish itself as a regional centre for
education. Besides earning foreign exchange, this move can also help to
save the RM2.5 billion spent annually by Malaysian students overseas.
  Underlying the commitment to upgrade its industries and human resources,
the Finance Minister has also announced that no more new foreign workers
will be allowed into the country. In this regard, a Guideline on Wage
Reform has also been introduced. The guideline proposes a productivity-
linked wage system to increase competitiveness, productivity and
industrial harmony. This is especially pertinent given that the wage
growth of eight per cent for the first seven months of this year has far
outstripped productivity growth of just 3.9 per cent.
  To ensure sustainable growth, the Budget also recognises the need to
maintain a low level of inflation. To this end, RM1.7 billion has been
provided to develop agriculture, fisheries and livestock as well as
increase the effectiveness of the marketing and distribution systems. More
import duties will be abolished or reduced on several items including
paper products, printed paper and cosmetics.
  In tandem with the government's efforts to check inflation, a cabinet
committee has been formed to promote the savings habit among Malaysians
with a long term target for savings rate at 40 per cent. This would
substantially reduce the present savings-investment gap as Malaysia needs
more funds to finance its many development plans.
  The recent implementation of major infrastructural projects has
contributed to a current account deficit, given the substantial imports of
both capital and intermediate goods. This is compounded by a chronic
service account deficit as illustrated in the charts.
  The service deficit seems to be the main culprit in the current account
problem. While the merchandise account can be improved relatively sooner,
the service account will take a little while longer as Malaysia
restructures its economy. Hence, to ensure a smooth transition of the
economy, a string of measures have been announced to give a strong boost
to its financial and other service sectors.
  To develop a dynamic banking and financial sector, some of the measures
announced in the Budget include:
  * Allowing foreign share-holding of local brokerages to be raised from
30 to 49 per cent;
  * More fund management companies will be approved with a concessionary
tax rate of 10 per cent, down from 30 per cent, to be allowed for both
foreign as well as local fund managers;
  * The government will issue zero coupon bonds to provide benchmark yield
curve to boost the private debt securities market. Major institutions like
the EPF, Bank Simpanan Nasional and the Social Security Organisation will
be allowed to invest in such instruments;
  * The banking sector will be further liberalised with Tier-1 commercial
banks allowed to undertake securities and lending business and engage in
equity derivatives.
  Besides the financial sector, the budget also grants incentives to
promote other service sectors. For instance, the export of professional
services has also been encouraged by its exemption from the services tax
and the shipping sector is granted an additional Shipping Fund of RM200
million.
  To attract more international companies to use Malaysia as an
International Procurement Centre (IPC) and thus add more value to the
economy, both the import duties and limits on foreign equity holdings in
IPCs are to be lifted.
  To promote Labuan as an international offshore financial centre, a
generous tax exemption is granted on 65 per cent of income from
professional services by Labuan-based firms. Expatriates in Labuan have to
pay tax only on 50 per cent of income.
  Recognising the tourism sector as a substantial foreign exchange earner,
the Budget allocated RM294.5 million for the construction and upgrading of
hotels, convention centres and other recreational projects to attract 9.5
million foreign visitors in 1997. A five year Pioneer Status for tourism
related infrastructure projects is also granted.
  Besides earning foreign exchange, the tourism sector could also help
prevent the outflow of the ringgit as more Malaysians start visiting the
newly built and upgraded tourist attractions in the country.
  One of the main causes of the current account deficit was the
substantial imports of capital and intermediate goods which resulted in a
high import content of domestic manufacturing activities. Hence, the
import duty on spare parts and consumables used in manufacturing as well
as on components used in the assembly industry will help to curb imports
and increase domestic production of intermediate goods. To boost
entreneurship, RM1 billion is allocated for such programmes as on vendor
development and the Incubator Premises and Factory Nurturing Schemes.
  Unprecendentedly, the Budget also gives a strong emphasis on the social
sector, reinforcing the government's determination to balance economic and
social development.
  The strategy to narrow the gap between the urban and the rural community
is high on Anwar's social agenda. His budget made a generous allocation of
RM7.05 billion for the development of rural areas. A sum of RM2.4 billion
is also set aside to further reduce poverty.
  Anwar also announced the setting up to a RM1 billion National Housing
Company to solve the housing problem of the low-income earners amid rising
property prices.
  As part of the government's effort to promote the social agenda, welfare
institutions are given assistance to the tune of RM280.7 million. Others
like the non-governmental organisations, AIDS Foundation and the Cancer
Society are also not forgotten.
  A sum of RM3.4 billion is budgeted for more hospitals and to enhance the
quality of health services. With the hospital services tax substantially
reduced, it will not only translate into savings for patients but also
help promote Malaysia as a regional medical centre.
  Given that the economy has already reached full employment and capacity
utilisation, Malaysia simply has no choice but to effect a clear shift to
higher technology and productivity to optimise the use of the nation's
capital and human resources. All these bold efforts must at the same time
be delicately balanced with a need to maintain price stability to prevent
inflation from rearing its ugly head.
  Hence, the generous incentives in the Budget for the information and
industrial technology sectors would certainly help to lay a proper
foundation for a knowledge-based and technologically sophisticated
economy.
  The Multimedia Supercorridor would, in time to come, help spin off and
spawn a whole network of IT related companies which would lift Malaysia
confidently into the information age. Together with incentives given to
programmes like the Inter-Industry Linkage Programme, the Vendor
Development and the Incubator Scheme, the day is not far off when Malaysia
will reach a critical mass in its R&D, thus helping it to become a
manufacturing power house.
  By focusing on the services sector, the Budget attacks the root cause of
the current account deficit problem. The host of incentives given to
develop the service sectors, such as the financial and tourism sectors,
would help the country to earn foreign exchange while steming the outflow
of the local currency, thus alleviating the service account deficit in the
long term. Through its offensive to develop its capital markets and
liberalise its banking industry further, Malaysia would one day pose a
challenge to the financial centres in the region.
balance the material progress of the nation with the well being of
society, as reflected by the generous allocation for social development.
In doing so, it gives full recognition to the important role of the family
and the individual in the development of the nation.
  Describing the balance of payments deficit as `birth pangs' of a new
economic era, Anwar said that this is to be expected for a country
undergoing transformation as it enters the 21st century. The Budget will
help to lay a strong foundation for sustaining long term growth.

Shifting prices: Multinationals and tax authorities face off on the issue
of transfer

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 47

MALAYSIA IS IN need of more transparent tax legislation on transfer
pricing as more Malaysian companies globalise their business activities,
states Price Waterhouse executive director SM Thanneermalai.
  He defines a transfer price as the price charged by a multinational
company (MNC) in a cross-border transaction for the supply or acquisition
of goods, services or intangibles and the provision of finance. Prices
charged in associated company transactions are not normally subjected to
full market forces and may otherwise diverge from prices that would be
charged in similar but independent transactions.
  Transfer pricing is possible through three methods. One way is for the
parent company to impose high prices for goods shipped to its subsidiary
in Malaysia. Alternatively, the parent company can direct its Malaysian
subsidiary to sell goods at lower prices to subsidiaries in third
countries. A third method would be for the parent company to charge
exorbitant royalties where the joint venture involves technical
assistance, technology transfer or management expertise, he elaborates.
  Transfer pricing has been identified as a major problem for tax
authorities because of its effect on profit-shifting between countries as
the level set bears directly on the amount of tax that may be raised in
each country. Malaysian companies expanding abroad thus have to understand
the transfer pricing laws of the foreign countries they are investing in
to avoid being hit by transfer pricing adjustments by foreign tax
authorities.
  Thanneermalai cites for example the case of a foreign tax authority
taking the view that excessive royalties have been repatriated back to
Malaysia. In such a circumstance, the Malaysian company would certainly
approach local tax authorities for a corresponding reduction of the taxes
overpaid earlier. `In such a scenario, you can see that even if Malaysia
wants to keep away from the arena of transfer pricing, the actions of the
other foreign tax authorities will not allow this to happen,' he stresses.
  Generally, other countries such as the United States have attacked
transfer pricing to raise tax revenues when faced with large deficits. The
US Internal Revenue Services implemented stiffer statutory transfer
pricing rules in 1986. Japan's National Tax Agency amended its 1986 rules
on transfer pricing in 1991, he adds.
  Malaysia's international trade has increased significantly in recent
years, with exports for 1995 worth RM185 billion compared with RM45
billion in 1987. Last year's imports amounted to RM194 billion compared
with only RM31 billion in 1987. With the increase in trade levels, there
is a greater likelihood of transfer pricing abuses.
  On a macro level, Malaysia's growing current account deficit under
`other services' hit RM4 billion in 1995. According to Thanneermalai, this
could be a factor prompting the government to examine whether transfer
pricing has contributed to this deficit. However, to date, no published
study has been made on the matter.
  At present, Malaysian tax authorities do not carry out specific transfer
pricing audits. Nevertheless, in tax investigations involving companies
with substantial cross border transactions, the issues around transfer
pricing become the main points of contention between the Malaysian tax
authorities and taxpayers, he points out. `By implication therefore,
Malaysian tax authorities are looking at transfer pricing issues such as
the payment for royalties, services, technical fee and merchandise
involving inter-company transactions across Malaysia's borders,' says
Thanneermalai.
  Although currently there are no specific statutory rules on transfer
pricing, two sections of the Malaysian Income Tax Act 1965 (the Act) can
be invoked when there are transfer pricing abuses: Section 141, which
deals with transactions with non-resident connected persons and Section
140, which is the general anti-avoidance provision.
  Section 141(1) of the Act applies to a transaction which produces to a
resident  `either no income or a smaller income than that which might be
expected to arise owing to the close connection between the resident and
non-resident and to the substantial control exercised by the non-resident
over the resident person.' In such a case, the Director-General of Income
Tax (DG) has the power to tax the non-resident in the name of the resident
on `the income which might be expected to arise from the business of the
resident as if the resident was an agent of the non-resident'.
  Section 141(2) of the Act states that if the profits cannot be readily
ascertained, the DG may assess the non-resident `on a fair and reasonable
percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non-resident
through or with the resident'.
  The second section of the Act provides the DG with wider powers. Section
140(1)(a) of the Act empowers the DG to `disregard or vary the transaction
and make such adjustments as he thinks fit where he has reason to believe
that any transaction has the direct or indirect effect of altering the
incidence of tax which is payable'.
  Section 140(6) of the Act allows the DG to deem certain transactions to
fall within Section 140(1) of the Act. These are transactions between
affiliated companies which `have not been made on terms which might fairly
be expected to have been made by an independent person engaged in the same
or similar activities dealing with one another at arm's length'. However,
there are no statutory rules, case laws or administrative rules in
Malaysia on the definition of the term `arm's length'. The lack of
definitions and guidelines of the above term has occasionally created
problems for taxpayers, states Panneermalai.
  Neighbouring countries which include Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan and
the Philippines have already implemented rules and regulations on transfer
pricing. In fact, Singapore is in the midst of collecting data, a step
before introducing rules on transfer pricing, he indicates. Most of the
countries that have adopted transfer pricing rules acknowledge the
guidelines provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). Malaysian tax authorities are agreeable to most OECD
guidelines although Malaysia is not an OECD member. `Generally, OECD
transaction-based methods such as the comparable uncontrolled price
method, the resale price method and the cost-plus method are acceptable to
Malaysian tax authorities. However, the tax authorities are not in favour
of the profit method unless there is no alternative,' he elaborates.
  Another major setback faced by MNCs in Malaysia is a provision in the
Income Tax statute which gives income tax authorities the right to collect
tax dating back to 12 years. In case of fraud, there are no time
limitations. This is where companies face major problems as they are
unable to retrieve documentation over that length of time due to improper
documentation and storage of the information,' he says.
  `Since we have sufficient legislation to combat any transfer pricing
abuses, Malaysian tax authorities should issue guidelines to determine
whether related party transactions are of arm's-length nature,' he
stresses. Having reasonable and transparent guidelines would definitely
increase the flow of foreign investments into Malaysia. MNCs will know
what the rules are and be able to avoid any future transfer pricing
fiascos.
  Two senior partners of Price Waterhouse, Terry Symons and Michael J
Happell recently gave a talk on global issues of transfer pricing.
Transfer pricing is the current `hot topic' for revenue authorities world-
wide as they get more aggressive in the fight for a share of the MNCs'
world tax revenues, according to Symons. He cites the example of Glaxo
Wellcome where the United Kingdom revenue authorities imposed a whopping
STG200 million (RM804 million) in transfer pricing adjustments.
  Recent tax authority transfer pricing adjustments have had a serious
impact on MNCs world-wide, leaving them open to extra taxation (see
table). In fact, Japan's National Tax Agency (NTA) statistics for the year
ended June 1996 indicate 44 cases with an income adjustment of US$ 450
million earned US$ 275 million in tax and penalties for NTA. NTA
statistics for the nine years since the introduction of transfer pricing
legislation recorded 130 cases involving income adjustments of US$ 1.8
billion, earning NTA a whopping US$ 1.1 billion in tax and penalties.

Stocks to watch: Tenaga Nasional Bhd

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 75

TNB recovered strongly from the recent low of RM8.55 to the current level
of RM10.90. As it constitutes some nine per cent of the KLSE CI, Tenaga
has set the pace for a run-up of the overall market. Technically, it has
formed a double bottom at RM8.55 and the first upside target is at RM11.70
which is close to the current level. Tenaga is expected to consolidate
between RM11.70 and RM10 for the near term.

New shareholders for Tenco?

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

TENCO BHD may see new faces on its board soon. Earwitness learns that  a
substantial block of Tenco shares could have changed hands recently at
around RM12 to RM13 apiece. This could probably account for the recent
sharp surge in Tenco's share price from RM12 to RM16 as at press time.
  The new shareholder is believed to be a property developer with strong
connections in northern Peninsular Malaysia. If all goes well, the
property developer may be looking into the possibility of pumping some
sizeable property projects into Tenco.
  Tenco, which was listed on the KLSE second board in Nov 1993, has a
paid-up capital of RM18 million. It is an investment holding company with
four wholly-owned subsidiaries mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale
of industrial adhesives, industrial chemicals, consumer and aerosol
products. It also sells industrial gases, industrial equipment and
building products.
  The range of building products marketed by Tenco includes floormats,
fibreglass wool and boards, polyethylene sheets and tubes.
  The major shareholders of Tenco as at Aug 16, 1996 comprise Wilken Sdn
Bhd (29%), Tan Yik Chin (6.4%), Tan Aik Teck (4.7%) and Tan Lee Ling
(4.4%). Tan Yik Chin is deemed interested in Wilken by virtue of his
shareholding in the company.
  In  May 1995, Tenco announced that the Securities Commission has given
the greenlight to lift the moratorium  of 6.89 million shares held by Tan
Yik Chin, Tan Aik Teck, Tan Lay Lee, Tan Lee Leng @ Tan Lee Fee and
Wilken. With the lifting of the moratorium, the major shareholders were to
have collectively provided a pretax profit guarantee of RM3.42 million for
both the financial years ended Mar 31, 1995 and 1996.
  Since Tenco's pretax profit for the two financial years amounted to
about RM4.45 million each, it looks like the major shareholders have met
the profit forecast.

Theory in practice: As Malaysian and Australian ministers speak of high
tides and pebbles

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 57

THERE IS NO doubt trade ties between Malaysia and Australia mean a lot to
both countries. Barring the occasional hiccup, the relationship between
both countries has generally been warm and cordial.
  Earlier this month, two Malaysian ministers flew to Sydney for a
Malaysia-Australia business dialogue organised by the Asian Strategy and
Leadership Institute. The event, themed `A New Era In Australia-Malaysia
Partnership', drew leading businessmen from both Malaysia (about 40) and
Australia (50).
  In his keynote address, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa
Mohamed drew attention to some Malaysian industries to be considered by
Australian companies about to venture abroad. Among them were the
production of intermediate and capital goods, construction and building
materials, information technology and computer software.
  In closing the dialogue, Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak
urged Australian business leaders to help develop Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC), telling them that they `should not miss this high
tide in our relations'.
  Such high-level salesmanship does not come from Malaysia alone.
  When Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was in Kuala Lumpur
last month to address the Malaysia-Australia University Alumni convention,
themed `Malaysia-Australia Relations Beyond 2000', he sent a similar
message. `We have moved beyond the time when governments alone were
responsible for promoting national achievements. The building of links at
the people-to-people level is, after all, the lifeblood of any
relationship,' he said.
  Downer said that the tide of economic, technological and social change
that was sweeping and transforming Australia has created opportunities for
co-operation and partnership between Malaysians and Australians,
particularly in the fields of finance, information technology, marketing,
medicine and education. `Further liberalisation of Malaysia's services
sector should, over time, create even more opportunities in these fields,'
he added.
  The day before Downer gave his speech, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad said Australia could play a major role in helping
Malaysia become an international centre of excellence in higher education.
`It is our hope that Australia, which has several established universities
and institutions, will encourage them to open branches in Malaysia or twin
with local institutions,' he said.
  These speeches highlight the opportunities available in Malaysia and
Australia which will bolster already healthy trade relations, as suggested
by the statistics. According to Malaysia's Economic Report 1996/97, total
trade with Australia expanded by 9.4 per cent to RM4.8 billion in the
first seven months of this year, with Malaysia continuing to record a
deficit.
  Exports to Australia increased by 3.9 per cent to RM1.7 billion while
imports expanded by 12.6 per cent to RM3.1 billion. In the corresponding
period in 1995, Malaysia's trade deficit with Australia was RM1.2 billion.
  Malaysia's investments in Australia stood at A$1 billion last year,
making it the second largest Asean investor after Singapore. About 60 per
cent of Malaysian money in Australia was in the property sector, followed
by mineral exploration and development.
  Downer tells Malaysian Business, `Based on our figures, over 61 per cent
of Australia's trade is with countries of East Asia, while 2.6 per cent of
our total world trade was with Malaysia in 1995-1996. This is up from 2.4
per cent the previous financial year. Malaysia is now our 11th largest
trading partner overall.' (Also see next story)
  Elaborating, he says, `Trade has grown strongly particularly in the more
elaborately transformed manufactures, in both directions. They now make up
26 per cent of Australia's exports to Malaysia.
  `We anticipate further growth in our trade with Malaysia and we would
like that percentage share to grow. Nevertheless, we recognize that
Malaysia is a very competitive market place. Australian products and
services have to be both high  in quality and competitively priced. As the
Prime Minister John Howard says, we are well aware that merely living in
the Asian region does not ensure us an easy road. He noted there are many
pebbles washing up on the economic shores of Asia. We must work hard to
make ours the most attractive pebbles. We cannot be complacent.
  In an interview published in May, the Australian High Commissioner to
Malaysia, William Farmer, was quoted as saying Malaysia was Australia's
second largest market in Asean for services, especially in education and
tourism. Australian investments as at June 30, 1994 stood at A$2.5
billion.
  Farmer said new Australian investments focused more on capital and
technology-intensive activities. Australian investors were also moving
into the transport and distribution sectors, as well as software and
management systems.

Ahead of the times: Singapore Airlines upgrades fleet and service to stay
ahead of the pack

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 80

IF ONE HAD TO name the world's most successful airline marketing campaign,
chances are Singapore Airlines (SIA) would constantly come to mind. The
clever imagery of the Singapore Girl - attractive and unflappable, smiling
at every situation in every corner of the world - has been a winner for
the airline. So has the reputation for excellence that SIA has created for
itself over the years.
  But it takes more than just advertising and a good reputation to keep an
airline right up front these days. The modern fleet of the last decade may
today translate into planes that are behind the times in seating,
electronics and passenger gadgetry.
  Today's airline management not only has to look ahead at who they have
to beat, but constantly look over their shoulders to see who is catching
up fast. It's a juggling act, but one at which SIA's management is
masterful, doubly to be admired because the small island state really does
not have an overload of tourist attractions.
  And for a population as small as that of Singapore's to have an airline
that is one of the world's leaders is an achievement indeed. It
illustrates the value of lateral thinking and bold, forward planning with
which the name Singapore Airlines has become synonymous.
  Right from the outset, the management has set out to be an industry
pacesetter. In those days this airline had Asia's youngest fleet, and
concentrated on being the first in Asia to bring their passengers such
amenities as inflight faxes and telephones.
  And when it came to designing an airport that was just as innovative,
only the best was good enough for Singapore also. Changi was the world
leader, making headlines everywhere when it opened. The second stage of
Changi has been completed, and this is just as good as the first, with the
only justifiable complaint being that there are just not enough moving
walkways to cover the vast distances involved.
  Nevertheless, when it comes to style and efficiency, I would back Changi
against any large airport in the world. Although SIA does not actually own
Changi airport, the smart, modern facilities there are closely associated
with the airline in the passenger's mindset. The bottom line is that, over
the years, SIA has built an enviable reputation, made bumper profits, has
had the cashflow (and where this was not enough, the confidence of bankers
and the investment public) to purchase the latest new aircraft, resulting
in a very large number of brand-loyal SIA frequent flyers.
  Safety and service are other very important aspects when choosing an
airline, and it is a comfort to any air traveller to know that the airline
they choose has a reliable record. In this regard it's hard to find
another Asian airline as decorated as SIA when nominations come from both
airline industry magazines and passenger and travel organisations. Flight
operations and pilot training have been recognised by the US-based
Professional Pilot magazine with its 1994 Airline of the Year award. The
UK travel trade newspaper, Travel Weekly, gave SIA the Best Airline in
Asia award in its 1994 Travel Industry Globe Awards.
  Not only that, in the last eight years, SIA has been nominated seven
times by the prestigious Conde Nast Traveller Magazine Readers' Choice
award for Best Airline - the last award being in 1995.
  Last year proved to be a good year for SIA when, for the sixth year
running, it was awarded the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Travel
Award for Best Airline. It also won the top airline of business travellers
award for the second successive year in an Asia Money 1995 Business Travel
Poll.
  Continued efforts to maintain SIA's service excellence both on the
ground and inflight has consistently earned it international travel and
passenger awards. One of the most telling awards of its diligence in this
regard is the `20 Years of Excellence in International Service' award from
Air Transport World in 1994.
  Not content to rest on its laurels, SIA is presently upgrading its
fleet. The Airbus A340-300E, launched worldwide this April, was made
possible when SIA took delivery of two A340's, acknowledged as having the
quietest cabin in the sky. Another 15 A340's are on order as part of the
airline's commitment to operate one of the youngest and most modern fleets
of any major international airline.
  SIA's managing director Dr Cheon Choon Kong explains, `We rate the
aircraft highly in terms of economy, modernity and comfort. It is a star
performer in all categories. Inspired by this, we have decided to name our
A340-300E the "Celestar." We believe this aircraft will truly be a "star
of the skies."'
  The Celestar A340 will offer passengers more non-stop services and
point-to-point connections. Its long range and medium-density routes
include Jakarta, Bangkok, Melbourne and Sydney. Non-stop services to Paris
that began this month will demonstrate the long-range capability of this
new Airbus Industrie star.
  SIA has made the Celestar its own with some custom additions. Its state-
of-the-art inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is found in every
class. Passenger response has been enthusiastic, and it's easy to
understand why. There is a choice of 22 video channels in the KrisWorld
system, along with 12 audio channels, 10 Nintendo games and real-time text
news which is updated on an hourly basis, bringing general news, financial
and sports headlines.
  There is also destination information on 176 cities on SIA's route
network together with a personal in-seat telephone and fax service that
allow passengers to place calls or transmit faxes from anywhere in the sky
to virtually anywhere on the ground.
  Reading in an upright or reclined position is easy with the individual
multi-positioning reading lights. Seat pitch for First Class passengers
has been extended to a generous 74in, offering a real sense of space.
  Raffles Class and Economy Class passengers also have adjustable
headrests with foldable `ears' for further support. Electric leg-rests and
deflatable lumbar supports are offered in Raffles Class, while footrests
give Economy Class passengers improved comfort.
  The airline's Megatop 747s have been refitted, refining the already
luxurious `sleeper' seats in First Class and allowing them to attain a
greater recline and increased height of the leg-rest to almost horizontal.
  Raffles Class passengers enjoy an improved seat pitch of 47in in the
Megatop; the backrest drops back an extra 2in, while the forward-mounted
legrest can be operated by remote control.
  Keeping in touch with passengers' requirements is part of the secret
behind SIA's success. The Silver Kris lounge at Changi is renowned as the
largest and most luxuriously appointed airport lounge on the globe. Here,
the seating capacity for 550 offers an unbeatable range of business and
personal amenities for SIA's First and Raffles Class passengers. Other
Silver Kris lounges are gradually being upgraded worldwide to match the
one at Changi.
  Apart from the inflight KrisWorld advantages of phone calls from the
seat, there are many little touches that keep SIA customers coming back.
Ground staff are always on hand to bid farewell to First Class passengers
either at the boarding gate or in the cabin, and on journeys longer than
four hours, local newspapers are offered on arrival at their destinations.
  For SIA's frequent flyers, a Priority Passenger Service (PPS) guarantees
members access to at least an Economy seat on any flight, provided a
minimum of 24 hours' notice is given. Recently, enhancements to PPS
include extra benefits and a second tier of membership - PPS Solitaire -
for loyal members.
  Cuisine has also been a strong point on SIA which offers Asian dishes
and European cuisine, halal on Middle Eastern routes and by request on
others. It's a formula that works well. Wine lists give the passengers a
choice of excellent German, French and Australian wines. Cocktails,
aperitifs, spirits, liqueurs and beers are supplemented by tea, herbal
teas, decaffeinated tea or coffee, and a choice of liqueur coffees such as
Highland Coffee (with Scotch whisky and whipped cream), Cafe Royale (with
XO brandy) and Cafe Mandarin (with Cointreau, essence of squeezed orange
peel and a topping of whipped cream).
  Other SIA initiatives to take the hassle out of travelling include a
return check-in. This allows passengers travelling to regional
destinations and returning within 48 hours to be issued with boarding
passes for both the outbound and inbound sectors.
  Other check-in improvements include a fax check-in, and for passengers
travelling out of Singapore, there is a check-in facility at SIA's
downtown ticket offices. An automated combined ticket and boarding pass
used on the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur shuttle service has further reduced
check-in time.
  Another key to a good airline is to have a schedule that takes the
passenger, especially the business traveller, to the destination he wants,
with a frequency that will suit his itinerary. For this, SIA has built a
very impressive network covering 73 cities in 41 countries. In addition,
SIA's regional subsidiary, SilkAir, serves 20 Asian destinations in eight
countries.
  SIA acknowledges that until the end of this century, the Asia-Pacific
region will be the fastest expanding area for civil aviation. China is
emerging as a big-growth potential market and SIA currently flies to
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, and will progressively add more
cities as the need arises.
  Indo-China is also ripe for both tourist and business travel expansion,
and SilkAir and SIA service Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi daily, with
Vietianne and Pnomh Phenh covered by three services weekly.
  Japan, however, remains SIA's most important market with Tokyo, Osaka,
Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sendai and Hiroshima accounting for a total of 58 flights
weekly.
  The problem that SIA has is that the other regional carriers all seem to
make a fetish of aiming to overtake SIA in quality. The naming of Malaysia
Airlines as the region's best First Class service last year sent shock
waves through SIA's corridors. Hasty conferences explored how such a thing
could happen, and efforts were redoubled to win back this position.
  If SIA has a fault, it may be that some passengers feel that they are
being taken a little for granted. Automated telephone answering that makes
passengers talk to machines rather than to human operators irritate many,
and the cutting out of inflight amenity packs in Business Class has also
drawn criticism from passengers I have spoken to.
  But these are minor problems, and it's my bet that they will be quickly
and effectively addressed. SIA has always been a quick learner and is
unlikely to let any glitches arise that will lose it passengers. The
airline has always believed in increasing services rather than
discounting, and has consequently enjoyed the loyalty of the premium
frequent flyer clientele. We cannot imagine any situation which will cause
this to change.

More tools of investment: New measures to turn Malaysia into a complete
capital market

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 45

ONE SIGNIFICANT feature of the 1997 Budget is the government's bid to
further broaden and deepen the financial services sector in the country.
  Like never before, measures have been spelt out to make Malaysia a
sophisticated and complete financial market. At present, investors have
limited options. Most will put their money in the equities or futures
market, while the risk averse investor will probably leave it in fixed
deposits to earn interest.
  But thanks to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim, his latest Budget has paved the way for the setting up of a
string of investments tools. For starters, Anwar proposed the introduction
of the over-the-counter (OTC) market and a series of bonds to provide a
benchmark yield curve.
  The OTC market which is similar to the NASDAQ in the United States, is
generally for the quotation of shares of high-profile technology companies
which do not meet the requirements for listing on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange's main or second board.
  To further promote the financial services sector, the minister also
allowed foreign broking firms to take equity of up to 49 per cent in
domestic brokerages.
  Local brokers can also undertake fund management and underwriting
activities, issue call warrants, manage listing of companies and undertake
electronic share transactions.
  Several economists interviewed by Malaysian Business feel that besides
adding more investment tools, these measures will set the basis for
Malaysia to be a complete capital market. MBf Securities economist Dr
Ghazali Atan says the measures will bring about more flexibility to the
capital market and more options for fund managers to spread the risk of
their portfolios.
  `The OTC market will basically be the KLSE's third board while the
benchmark for bonds enhances the creation of a liquid bond market. At the
same time it will also provide an index for bonds. At present, we have the
equities and derivatives markets. With the bond and OTC markets, there
will be more tools for investors and those who need to raise finance,' he
adds.
  Subsequent to the Budget announcement, the government announced that
Khazanah Holding, its investment arm, will issue a series of bonds to
serve as a benchmark.
  Arab-Malaysian Securities economist Mustafa Mohd Nor echoes the views of
Ghazali and says the measures will induce the creation of more
sophisticated tools of investment. `Without the proposed instruments,
Malaysia is not complete as a regional financial services centre. We have
to start somewhere to build up more capital market instruments,' he says.
  The importance the government places in expanding the capital market
does not come as a surprise considering that there was a significant
increase in funds raised by both the public and private sector from the
market during the first eight months of the year. According to the 1996/97
Economic Report, total funds raised by the public and private sectors
through the capital market increased significantly by 64.2 per cent to
RM20.4 billion compared to RM12.4 billion mobilised the corresponding
period last year.
  Net funds mobilised through the private debt securities market during
the period was RM10.1 billion, a significant increase compared to RM4.9
billion recorded in the corresponding period of 1995. (See table.)
  With the Budget paving the way for the development of a complete capital
market, the question which lingers on our minds is how and when will these
new instruments take off?
  Consider the fact that the Kuala Lumpur Options & Financal Futures
Exchange (KLOFFE) has yet to significantly take off since commencing
operations on Dec 15, last year. Mustafa feels time will tell whether or
not the new instruments for investments and raising capital will take off.
  `Even the present equities market took off only in the early 1990s.
KLOFFE may be slow but given time, it should take off. The main thing is
that we have a base to create more capital market instruments. The opening
up of local broking firms to foreign brokerages is a supporting factor to
develop the local capital market,' Mustafa says.
  Ghazali says the new tools will also likely to see private investors
depending less on banks as a mean for raising funds. `Companies will be
less bound towards banks. The OTC market will enable companies which need
funds to issue shares. These companies need not depend on banks solely for
finance,' he adds.
  Besides banks and financial institutions, merchant banks and fund
management companies also feel another competition coming their way
following measures introduced in the Budget. Anwar had announced the
expansion of the scope of the local brokerages.
  Currently, brokerages are only involved in the trading of shares. But
the Budget has proposed to allow them to manage the listing of companies,
undertake fund management and underwriting activities. The listings of new
companies and underwriting activities are now carried out by merchant
banks.
  Ghazali says the proposed measures are good as they would provide
merchant banks with competition. However, he dismissed any notion that
merchant banks will be adversely hit. He says with the OTC and private
companies allowed to issue bonds, the scope of the capital market will be
enlarged. `Basically the cake will be bigger and there are more players to
share it' he says.
  Moreover, an investment analyst feels merchant banks will not be
threatened as they (merchant banks) are established and provide supporting
services for companies seeking a listing like financing and underwriting.
`In the short-term, there is not much the brokerages can do. Firstly, it
is difficult to set up a corporate finance department while many of the
merchant banks have their steady base of clients. Also, many of the big
local brokerages come under banks or already have an interest in a
merchant bank,' he says.
  Citing the examples of Arab-Malaysian Securities or Rashid Hussain
Securities, the analyst points out that these brokerages already have an
interest in merchant banking activities.
  `Thus it serves no purpose for them to create unnecessary competition.
It merely provides an opportunity for the smaller brokerages without any
interest in merchant banks. But this will take time,' he says.

Way out of Ampang snarl: Prolintas starts work on twin-deck highway above
Klang River

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 38

`THERE ARE just too many people in Kuala Lumpur. New offices, new cars.
Who knows how many more in two or three years' time,' the cabbie muses.
`More buildings will add more cars to the roads. If only more people used
the bus and taxi ...'
  Public transportation may be one way around Kuala Lumpur's traffic woes.
But the latest attempt to ease the city of traffic congestion comes in the
form of an elevated highway. Called the Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway
(KLEH) project, it does not come cheap at about RM100 million per km!
  When completed in 1999, the KLEH will give city motorists extra motoring
space over the Klang River. It will be the main artery linking Kuala
Lumpur's eastern corridor (Jalan Jelatek, Jalan Datuk Keramat, Jalan
Ampang, Jalan Ampang Hilir) to the city centre (Jalan Sultan Ismail).
  Project Lintasan Kota Sdn Bhd (Prolintas) is the KLEH concessionaire.
Its general manager Abdullah Hassan says that among the plus points,
state-of-the-art KLEH is an environmentally sound option, emphasising the
importance of aesthetics. `I can't say whether or not the pillars will be
grey, but basically it will take into account its surroundings,' he says
with a chuckle.
  Part of the reason why the KLEH will be the most expensive highway is
the land factor. Construction is atop prime land in the city, most of
which (except for some private land), belongs to the Drainage and
Irrigation Department.
  The interchanges, as well as the beginning and end of the highway, will
be built over main land mass, not river banks. It is understood that not
all the required land has been acquired. Public relations officer Norhanim
Zakaria says, `We're still in the process of acquiring land for the
project.'
  Another costly factor, according to KLEH project manager Mohd Mazlan
Mohd Yusof, is technology. He says, `The bottom of the pillars are
designed in cut-edged shape so that when the water level rises during high
tide or flood, there is minimum resistance against the pillars, minimising
the back water effect. Their width at 14m is almost double the width of
pillars used for the Light Rail Transit (LRT).' Other costs include
relocating squatters and the diversion of water pipes and power cables
lining the length of the river.
  But in the end, the investment could be well worth it. Abdullah says,
`It will absorb traffic from Jalan Ampang, reduce bumper to bumper
bottlenecks and cut down travelling time to the central business district
by more than half.' Work on the KLEH is also said to be less damaging to
the environment.
  At present, 40,000 vehicles use Jalan Ampang daily. Studies show that it
takes 45 minutes to drive to or out of the city centre and even longer
during peak hours. Abdullah says,`If you build a flyover or expand the
road, two lanes have to be closed. The disruption to traffic and
businesses would be enormous.'
  One estimate by Percon, Permodalan Nasional Berhad's construction
subsidiary, is that the traffic volume in Jalan Ampang alone will increase
to 55,000 vehicles by the year 2005. In less than five years, the city's
population will increase from 1.6 million to 2.2 million. The rush is on
to complete the elevated highway.
  Abdullah says piling work has already begun on the RM700 million build,
operate and transfer (BOT) project starting at the 14-lane toll plaza in
Jalan Datuk Keramat. Phase 1 comprises twin decks with seven interchanges
beginning near Wisma Denmark, rising to Jalan Jelatek, then down to Jalan
Ampang. After Jalan Jelatek, the twin decks merge into one single wider
deck on a two-lane dual carriageway. Seven interchanges connect with
existing roads, the latter serving as secondary roads once the KLEH is
ready. The interchanges are at Jalan Sultan Ismail, KLCC, Jalan Tun Razak,
Jalan Jelatek, Jalan Ulu Kelang, Jalan Kerja Air Lama and Jalan Ampang.
  Phase 2 of KLEH comprises a single deck extension from Phase 1 in Jalan
Jelatek to Jalan Ampang, completing the whole twin-deck highway. Abdullah
says, `Work on Phase 2 will commence when traffic reaches 93,600 vehicles
a day or by the year 2013, even if traffic has not reached that volume by
then.'
  Six kilometres of the 7.4 km KLEH will be elevated - at its highest
point reaching up to 12 metres. Noise barriers will be erected near
schools, hospitals and other sensitive areas. Mazlan says the company is
considering see-through perspex buffers instead of using conventional
concrete panelling. The speed limit? Up to 80km/h on the twin deck and
65km/h where the decks merge into one.
  A consortium of three companies comprising main contractor Percon, sub-
contractors MMC Engineering Bhd and Leighton Holdings Bhd will construct
the elevated portion of KLEH.
  Prolintas, the KLEH concession holder, has a paid-up capital of RM10
million. It is 60 per cent owned by Permodalan Nasional Berhad with the
remaining shares held by Percon (formerly known as Pernas Construction).
  The maintenance job and toll concession has been awarded to Prolintas
for 33 years, starting from the time work commences. Abdullah expects the
company to break even in about 10 years after KLEH opens. `By then, we
should be able to repay our commercial creditors,' he adds.
  Another project source says that if about RM3 million in toll was
collected a month, the potential revenue could be RM36 million a year.
  The first highway to be built above a river boasts a few advantages over
conventional highways. Abdullah says, `It minimises disruption to traffic,
businesses and activities at the main road. As it will be built mostly on
government property, it minimises social problems related to land
acquisitions, especially in a heavily populated area as this.'
  Some squatter settlements will be relocated for the highway but the
numbers are small compared with other projects. Norhanim says about 95
affected squatter families in Federal Territory and another 56 in Selangor
will be relocated to longhouses in Kampung Air Lanjut, Setapak and Kampung
Wira Damai and Gombak.
  Says Abdullah, `The Klang river now flows along the central channel in
the middle. The highway's concrete pillars on both sides of the river
banks only affect water flow during flood or high tide. After the pillars
are built, work concentrates on the top, hence disruption to life below is
minimised. `The pillars' foundation will be layed by bored piling, a
screw-in technique which eliminates the hammering thunders of the
conventional method.
  Fears have been raised over the river's eco-system. Experts say that
without ultra violet rays, bacteria in the river would fester and
ultimately destroy its eco-system. But Mazlan assures that it is not a
problem. `The elevated twin decks will be separated 12m edge to edge to
allow direct sunlight to the river below.'
  Mazlan says, `I believe the end result will be pleasant. It is
environmentally sound and we are building an alternative access out of KL.
The project will straighten out meandering parts of the Klang River and
incorporate a masterplan to beautify it.
  `At present, there are bends in the river which are collection points
for rubbish and debris. Once these are straightened out, water flow will
become smoother.' Below KLEH, the Drainage and Irrigation Department will
build walkways with handrails for pedestrians and joggers.
  After 25 years of building roads, bridges and highways, Percon has
established its name as an infrastructure builder. It has completed RM1
billion worth of projects including the Istana Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, the
Seremban-Kuala Lumpur highway improvement project, two packages of the
North-South highway project, drainage and earthworks for Package 5 of the
KLIA at Sepang, the KL-PJ highway and the Gambang-Kuala Lepar Highway
(Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan). Its current projects include the Shah Alam-
Petaling Jaya expressway and the Malaysian Embassy building in Bangkok.
  The KLEH is a substantial investment for the future, for Percon and
motorists who use the highway. Abdullah says, `If this project proves to
be suitable, it will be a launching pad for us to export our expertise
overseas.'

Satellite parts from Zasna

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

ZASNA Technology Sdn Bhd, a company linked to Nepline Bhd executive
chairman Dr Nik Mohd Zain Omar, will become the first Bumiputera company
to manufacture hardware and components for satellite receiver systems.
  Industry sources tell Earwitness, Zasna will be teaming up with a German
company, Ge-tronic Seislinger Electronic. They also say that the joint-
venture will initially export the products to Ge-tronic in Germany, which
will in turn market the products worldwide.
  Ge-tronic is a well-known company which supplies satellite receiver
multiswitches and cable TV (CATV) amplifiers to original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) customers such as Philips and Nokia.
  The sources say the multi-million ringgit factory will be located in
Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. Nik has plans to eventually list Zasna on the
main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
  This is not Nik's first venture in Kelantan in his personal capacity. He
is also teaming up with several entrepreneurs to set up Kelantan's first
private hospital in Kota Bharu.
