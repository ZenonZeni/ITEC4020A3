photoexcitation, which in these types of materials is rich in information concerning defects at the electronic 
level of usefulness to the electronics industry. Another feature will be novel gas sensors based on photothermal 
effects and a thermal-wave resonant cavity: The thermal equivalent to a laser cavity!<p>

Laboratory of Applied Surface Thermodynamics (MB 56)<p>
<I>Description for Tour</I><p>
Surface thermodynamics is the study of the interface between adjoining fluids or fluids 
and solids.  In our laboratory, we use digital image analysis to measure surface tension, 
line tension, and  contact angles.  The quantities are important in a wide variety of     
areas including detergents, coating and painting, lubrication, multiphase flow, and heat 
transfer.  In addition, we are applying our techniques to problmes in biomedical 
engineering such the measurement of lung surfactant surface tension, protein 
adsorption, and protein interactions.<p>

Ultrasonic Nondestructive Testing (Main Corridor in  MC)<p>
<I>Description for Tour</I><p>
In the same way that ultrasound can be used by doctors to see the fetus in a pregnant 
woman, engineers use ultrasound to search for flaws and cracks inside engineering 
structures.  Ultrasound pulses are sent into the structure and bounce off defects; the 
echoes are then picked up by a device similar to a microphone.  This technology is in  
widespread use in the transportation, aerospace, nuclear power, and petrochemical 
industries. <p>

<I>Description for Tour</I> <p>
<dir>
<li>  The emission free power supply is constructed of an alkaline fuel cell and a hydrogen storage system.  
The water produced by the power supply is circulated to the hydrogen storage system where it reacts with a
 material to produce hydrogen.  The hydrogen is circulated to the fuel cell where it produces electrical power 
and the water required to sustain the reaction.  The reaction products are retained in the hydrogen storage 
system.<p>
<li> When the gravitational intensity on fluids is reduced to near-zero, surface tension forces control the 
configuration that a fluid adopts.  As a result, fluids held 
in a container adopt some unearthly configurations and some of these can be observed when the fluid is in free fall.
