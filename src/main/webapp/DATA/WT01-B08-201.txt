<H3>APPLYING FOR AN <I>ENCRYPTION LICENSING ARRANGEMENT</I></H3>
</center>
&#167 742.15(b)(4)(i) of the encryption regulation published in the Federal Register on December 30, 1996  addresses licensing policy for <i>Encryption licensing arrangements</i>.  The Federal Register Notice says:
<blockquote><font size=2>Applicants may submit license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan.  Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods specified in block #24 on Form BXA-748P.  In addition, the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users.  Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.</font></blockquote>

In addition to following this, and all other instructions in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and on form BXA-748P, there are several other things you can do to ensure that your application for an <i>encryption licensing arrangement</i> is reviewed as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The following is guidance on how to fill out certain portions of Form BXA-748P for <i>encryption licensing arrangements</i>:<p>

<br>
<H3>BLOCK 9</H3>
Put the words "Encryption Licensing Arrangement" in this block, as shown below.<p>

<br>
<H3>BLOCK 22</H3>

<H3>BLOCK 23</H3>

You may leave this block blank.<p>

<br>
<H3>BLOCK 24</H3>

As stated in the regulation, specify the sales territory in this block.  List specific countries, not regions.  Also, specify if you would like an extended validity period.  The normal validity period of a BXA-issued export license is two years.  If you are selling to certain classes of end users, list them in this block, as stated in the regulation.<p>
