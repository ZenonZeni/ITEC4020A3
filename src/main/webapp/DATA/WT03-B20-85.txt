<h1>Renewable Energy: Photovoltaics</h1><p>
<p>
Photovoltaics (PV), the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, has 
made
remarkable strides since its invention in the 1950s. Most locations in 
this
country are good for photovoltaics. PV systems are assembled by grouping 
cells
into modules and, in turn, connecting modules into arrays.  As the cost 
of PV
modules continues to decrease, the size and value of PV systems that are 
cost
effective increase steadily. PV systems have no moving parts to wear out 
or
break down, make no noise, and cause no pollution while generating
electricity.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Land use for PV is reasonable; PV modules covering 0.3% of the land of 
this
country, one-fourth of the area occupied by roadways, could provide all 
of its
electricity.  <p>

PV electrical output correlates well with the daily load pattern of many
utilities, which generally increases during daylight hours when people 
are more
active and decreases again at night. This means that PV systems can help
alleviate peak loads and reduce the need for new power plants. <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use, Cost, and Market Growth</h2>
The combined efforts of industry and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
have
reduced PV system costs by more than 300% since 1982.  The PV market is
estimated to be growing at 20% per year today.  The number of U.S. 
companies
producing PV panels has doubled since the late 1970s to about 20 
today.<p>

The most frequently seen application of PV is in consumer products, using 
tiny
amounts of direct current (dc) power, less than 1 watt (W).  More than 1
billion hand-held calculators, several million watches, and a couple of 
million
portable lights and battery chargers are all powered by PV cells. <p>

PV is rapidly becoming the power supply of choice for all remote and
small-power, dc applications of 100 W or less.    <p>

More than 200,000 homes worldwide depend on PV to supply all of their
electricity.  Most of these systems are rated about 1 kW and often supply

alternating current (ac) power. <p>

PV module production for terrestrial use has increased 500-fold in the 
past
20 years. Worldwide PV module shipments in 1993 were 60 megawatts (MW).
The U.S. share of this market is now one-third.  Worldwide production of 
PV
modules includes 48% single-crystal silicon, 30% polycrystalline silicon, 
and
20% amorphous silicon, mostly used in consumer products.  <p>

The cost of larger PV systems (greater than 1 kW) is measured in 
"levelized"
costs per kWh--the costs are spread out over the system lifetime and 
divided by
kWh output.  The levelized cost is now about $0.25 to $0.50/kWh.  At this

price, PV is cost effective for residential customers located farther 
than a
quarter of a mile from the utility line.  Reliability and lifetime are 
steadily
improving; PV manufacturers guarantee their products for up to 20 years. 
<p>

The worldwide manufacturing capacity of PV modules will almost double by 
1996
from 60 MW to 100 MW.  The increase will take place in all of the major 
PV
technologies.  Most of this increase in capacity is taking place in the 
United
States; however, new manufacturing plants are also under construction in
Brazil, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, and the United Kingdom.  
<p>

The worldwide PV industry has grown from sales of less than $2 million in 
1975
to greater than $750 million in 1993. The companies with the largest 
increase
in sales in the 1990s have been U.S. companies, reflecting their strong,
competitive position. The U.S. just regained the lead over Japan in gross

annual sales of PV.<p>
<p>
<h2>Technology Development</h2>
All types of PV technologies are improving their performance.  The 
efficiency
of existing commercial PV modules is 5% to 13%.  Manufacturers are using
automation and taking advantage of economies of scale in production and
purchasing to further lower costs.  These costs are expected to be cut in 
half
within a decade.  The United States is leading the world in developing 
and
commercializing high-performance and low-cost PV technology.<p>
