<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These automated powder coating systems can coat products as small as a tiny screw to as large as a 10-foot long wall panel. The 
heart of the system is the gun-control unit that controls all the pneumatic and electrical functions of each gun. Modules are 
ergonomically positioned for ease of operation and can be added or removed quickly.<P>  

The master system control modules provide electrical and pneumatic supplies for up to nine gun units and incorporate the 
controls for fluidized beds and gun manipulators if needed.<P> 

Manual systems include a powder feed cup, fluidized bed or direct feed from the powder container. The fluidized bed is used 
with a 25 kg hopper or 1.25 kg hopper for short runs.<P>  

The automatic powder gun incorporates a forward air line, permitting variable velocity powder emissions for additional spray 
pattern control without altering powder output.<P>  

Powder is contained in a number of fluidized beds, fed to the gun by the V55 venturi, which uses two air lines to ensure 
controllable, surge-free powder delivery from low flows to 500 grams per min. The system provides smooth, uniform coverage even at 
powder outputs of 200 grams per min and a charge of 20 uA at 60kV, even on complex-shaped parts.<P>  

Two manipulators are available with the powder system. One is a conventional type and the other is the &quot;Swinger.&quot;  This is an electrically driven manipulator designed to carry multiple spray guns performing the same or different motions. The guns may 
either reciprocate vertically over a short arc or swing through an arc up to a maximum angle of 90 deg. Alternate guns may be mounted 
in a fixed position or any combination to obtain optimum product coating performance.<P>
