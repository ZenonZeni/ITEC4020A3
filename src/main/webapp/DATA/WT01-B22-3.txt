<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. WRIGHT</h1>

<p><b>Professor of Agronomy University of Wisconsin<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. WRIGHT: Gentlemen, let me say to you in the first place
that <br>
while I am connected with the University of Wisconsin, so far as
the hemp <br>
work is concerned, the hemp being Marihuana, I am working as an
agent and <br>
in cooperation with the Bureau of Plant Industry here in
Washington. <br>
I had better assume that you are about the agricultural side like
I am <br>
about chemistry, that you do not know very much about it.
Therefore, <br>
suppose I sketch briefly the practical every day procedure by
which hemp <br>
is handled in the United States and Canada, not mentioning
anything about <br>
the European situation, and as Dr. Robinson is going to review
something <br>
about the history of hemp, I will leave that out entirely.<br>
In the United States hemp is an annual crop produced from seed <br>
planted each year, planted in the Spring the same as small grains
are <br>
planted, the same as corn is planted.<br>
It has been grown during recent years almost exclusively in very
few <br>
sections; Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.<br>
It is planted en masse thickly as small grain, in other words, it
is <br>
drilled in.<br>
It is planted on very good soil in order to be a profitable
production. <br>
It is a crop limited to good soil<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
for profitable production most every where in the world, and it
is seeded <br>
about a bushel to the acre on soil, prepared as for small grain. <br>
After it is planted, there is nothing left to be done except to
wait <br>
for it to be harvested, and it is harvested in the latter part of
August, <br>
throughout September, and sometimes extending into October
depending on <br>
the section of the United States or Canada.<br>
The seed is usually produced in Kentucky, and in the North
American <br>
Continent, very rarely any other place. In the sections where it
is grown <br>
for fibre or industrial uses, seed is not produced.<br>
The usual, or arbitrary way of determining when to harvest a crop
is <br>
when it is well in blossom, we will say rather late blossom when
the <br>
pollen is being fairly cleared, depending from that time on how <br>
circumstances work out, but that is when it is begun.<br>
It is generally harvested now by special machinery which has been
<br>
developed during the last few years. It is cut and spread in
swaths of even <br>
length. It is left in the stuble, spread out for retting.<br>
Now, the exact procedure varies in different sections of the
country. <br>
This retting period, that is the period when the so-called fibre
portion of <br>
the stem is released<br>
<br>
19<br>
<br>
from the woody portion, varies from two weeks to, in certain
cases, two <br>
months.<br>
After it has reached that stage where the fibre can be removed
from <br>
the straw by being dressed, it is gathered and bound in bundles
and <br>
shocked. Then it is put in stacks, usually in hemp mills or
processing <br>
plants.<br>
From these stacks it is sent to the dryer, and dried to what is <br>
commonly called in the trade bone-dry condition and which would
mean 8 <br>
or 9 or 10% moisture.<br>
Then it is crushed by the breaking process, that is the fiber is <br>
separated by the usual process called scutching, and it is
divided into two <br>
kinds of fibre, one the long stretch, and the other tangled, and
then it is <br>
inserted in bales.<br>
That, I believe, is the agricultural procedure of the handling of
the <br>
hemp.<br>
There is a little variation in Kentucky because of the weather <br>
conditions. It is not retted immediately, but shocked until later
in the <br>
season when the retting conditioning can be done.<br>
In the northern part of the country, it is spread on the ground
and the <br>
retting is done immediately.<br>
Now, I want to avoid going into the acreage and that phase of the
<br>
work for Dr. Robinson is going to cover that.<br>
<br>
20<br>
<br>
I would like to inject this thought here for I am sure it will do
no <br>
harm, and that is that hemp has been an American industry ever
since <br>
Colonial times It is not a large industry. It has had its ups and
downs, but <br>
it has been an American industry since Colonial times, and it is
one of the <br>
oldest crops that we have in the United States.<br>
It is used, as you know, from an industrial stand-point for
textile <br>
purposes, and to a minor extent for other purposes and Dr.
Robinson will <br>
develop that.<br>
Now, there might be perhaps some questions right now. One or two <br>
other items I want to take up before I am through.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Go right ahead.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: You know I might not have another chance to say <br>
anything<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You will be given a chance. Go right <br>
ahead, Dr. Wright.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I was just wanted to throw this into the pot, and
that <br>
is, of course, that we who work with the commercial producers,
and the <br>
industry naturally collectively, and I suppose we are justifiable
in that, <br>
our prejudices are on that side. I do not think we would be human
if we <br>
were not, and I do not claim to be other than human. We have a
small <br>
industry in the United States that<br>
<br>
21<br>
<br>
has had its ups and downs over a long period of time. We still
produce <br>
commercial hemp and fibre. Those in the industry are naturally
concerned. <br>
They have a stake in that they have what little they have
invested in the <br>
business. <br>
They are not concerned about this last law because I believe they
<br>
were given a very square deal in the national legislation on the
matter. <br>
What they are concerned about is the public position, that
indefinite <br>
intangible thing, public feeling about growing hemp at all. <br>
They have already been subjected to some rather embarrassing <br>
situations. <br>
Now, just suppose that as a result of the agitation, warranted or
<br>
not, and there are probably two views on that, and I am open to
both <br>
views, the extensive publicity that has been given in the hemp
states, <br>
particularly Wisconsin where there is much agitation, that some
kind of a <br>
legislation will come up to put out or eradicate the production
of hemp <br>
under the Weed Control Department or the Legislature
appropriating money <br>
to do it. <br>
I will not bother you long on that, but I just want to mention
that <br>
and show what problem we will be called on to face. Those men
have <br>
managed to keep their mouths<br>
<br>
22<br>
shut and have expressed no views concerning Marihuana in public,
for we <br>
feel we are not in a position to do so, and we would like to be
sure of our <br>
ground before doing it.<br>
Of course, having worked with eradication procedures and <br>
eradication programs, unless you would convince us otherwise we
would <br>
oppose the eradication program in Wisconsin as we see it now with
the <br>
immense cost and the things of that sort.<br>
Now comes the other phase of it. We have been trying, in
cooperation <br>
with the Bureau of Plant Industry, and Dr. Robinson and the
Division of <br>
Pharmacy of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Link who is head
of the <br>
Bio-Chemistry Department of the University of Wisconsin to begin
a study <br>
of Cannabis in relation to hemp as a crop. <br>
Without going into details, I think I have told you my story for
the <br>
present.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We thank you very much, Doctor. Before <br>
we go on to Dr. Robinson, I think there were various points
brought up that <br>
our conferees would like to discuss.<br>
There is one point about commercial hemp. We did not make a
survey <br>
in your State, but we did make a survey in the State of
Minnesota, and <br>
some of the hemp that was harvested in 1934 is still on the
ground. <br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: That is right.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is giving us a great deal of
difficulty. <br>
The farmers up in Minnesota in some of the sections have been
subjected <br>
to various promotion schemes. Due to the existence of stacks of
the old <br>
1934 and 1935 crop of harvested hemp in Southern Minnesota, which
is a <br>
menace to society in that it has been used by traffickers, we
have <br>
arrested a gang who took a truck load of this Marihuana into New
York.<br>
I will say that the farmers up there have been cooperating with
us <br>
100%. If they see anybody around that section who looks like a
trafficker, <br>
they bring out their old shot guns, and he is soon disposed of.
We have very <br>
little trouble from the farmers up there.<br>
It is said that every stack contains a plentiful supply for
smoking <br>
purposes.<br>
Allegations have been made that if it was on the ground three
years <br>
there would not be any resin left. Mr. Wollner can tell you how
much resin <br>
some of the experts reported after Marihuana had been lying on
the ground <br>
three years. It seems that the traffickers can find it. Our own
chemists <br>
have found it.<br>
We feel that the farmer is entitled to a reasonable return for
these <br>
old crops. He planted the crop in goodfaith; he has no desire to
violate the <br>
law, and we have<br>
<br>
24<br>
<br>
been assured that the removal of the harvested crops is very
desirable. It <br>
is a very difficult situation.<br>
Have you any observations to make, or any discussion on the <br>
question?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: As to thw commercial procedure, tha plant is spread
<br>
out on the land, and left there until the stalks are retted, and
some of the <br>
leaves are gone. It is shocked and taken into the hemp mill. The
grower is <br>
uncertain as to where he stands, and whether the leaves that are <br>
associated with the straw are in the legal sense Marihuana,
referring, of <br>
course, to that particular clause in the law which refers to dry
stalks.<br>
Now this is done as follows: the straw is left on the land in the
<br>
stubble for varying times, as I say, from two weeks or longer
during this <br>
retting process. It is subject to the action of rains and
bleaching and <br>
decomposition with the various effects of bacteria and fungi, but
when it <br>
is taken in, it still retains a trace of the leaves. That is what
affects the <br>
folks up there in Minnesota.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I notice the term &quot;hurds&quot;
referred to.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: That is the non-fibrous material crushed and taken
away <br>
from the fibrous. It is the residue. It<br>
<br>
25<br>
<br>
would be the same as shives in flax.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I am afraid to say that the experiment with
Minnesota <br>
hemp is rather inconclusive. As I understand it the hemp was
bundled <br>
before it had been permitted to ret for an extended period of
time.<br>
It may be we will find that if the hemp is permitted to ret
before it <br>
is stacked, a further decomposition of the drug will ensue.
However, we do <br>
know that the Minnesota hemp of 1934 is active.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It would be active.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER. It is active but whether the activity was retained
by <br>
improper handling of the hemp, I don't know. As I understand it
they were <br>
advised to bunch their hemp before it was retted.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It was never rotted or retted. The plan of handling
in <br>
Minnesota was unauthorized. In other words, it was contrary to
the usual <br>
procedure. They put the green hemp or the semi-green hemp in a
bundle, <br>
and at a later stage it would be known in the trade as green
hemp. That <br>
was never used for textile purposes. It was not suitable for
textile <br>
purposes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then, Dr. Wright, your opinion is that if
<br>
harvested properly most of the leaves avould remain on the ground
and not <br>
adhere to the stalks?<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I will be perfectly frank in telling you that will
vary in <br>
seasonal conditions, and so we are much concerned about that.
There are <br>
leaves left. As to the condition of those leaves, we don't know.
They are <br>
left, and there is no use in denying that. There are considerable
left on the <br>
straw. There are not a great deal, but there are leaves left. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then prompt harvesting would reduce this <br>
danger we are now confronted with? <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It would.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: What about the hemp stacked green in Kentucky; <br>
doesn't that mold more than that left on the ground?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Hemp is left in the shock in Kentucky. You will
correct <br>
me Dr. Robinson, if I'm wrong, because it has been fifteen years
since I <br>
was down there, but it is my impression that it is shocked. It is
first <br>
spread and allowed to wilt on the ground.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Then there is no molding?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: If properly handled there will be no molding. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: From our point of view that would be improper <br>
handling; there would be no decomposition of the resin.<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: The general weathering we would get would be during <br>
the curing stage.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: How long, about, does that take?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Now, after it is shocked, cured and stacked, later it
is <br>
spread on the land again and retted.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: But, during this period, of course, it would be in <br>
excellent condition for smoking, - that is, relatively dry in the
stack.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: From the time it is cut until it is rotted, whatever <br>
leaves there are should be suitable for Marihuana.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: While we have not found in New York State a large <br>
agricultural growth, we do find that the largest part of our
growth, <br>
instead of being on good soil, is on poor soil.<br>
For the past two years when I have been looking for wild growth,
I <br>
have found it in dumps or soil that has a high content of ashes
or cinders, <br>
and I have found it trying to grow it in my own garden but the
growth does <br>
not begin to compare with that of the cinder growth, and as a
matter of <br>
fact we have found that most recently the wild growth seeks that
kind of <br>
soil.<br>
That does not prove anything, of course, except we have probably <br>
most of our wild growth coming from ashes<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
and cinders and public dumps. This did strike me very forcibly,
and what <br>
struck me more forcibly was that we had some of the biggest
growths in <br>
Brooklyn where it was almost a clear cinder dump.<br>
Our experience in New York State so far has not produced anyone
who <br>
desired to be licensed as a cultivator.<br>
I think some of that might be offset if the public was assured
that <br>
the cultivator would have to be licensed, after proper
investigation, and <br>
that definite qualifications exist to establish control.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: As to your first statement about hemp growing on <br>
cinder beds, wild hemp, - it is not a fibrous hemp. As all of you
who are <br>
familMWith the middle west know, you will find blocks that were <br>
formerly even cinder beds, but fibrous hemp will not grow there. <br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: The point I was chiefly interested in was the public <br>
interest, where it was grown, whether being produced by chance or
design.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: We are hopeful we can clarify this situation. Since <br>
legislation may be introduced to eradicate or to bring pressure
upon the <br>
legitimate producer, I appreciate your suggestion. I think it is
a good one.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We have also in New York State given some
consideration <br>
to definite measures for removal, but so far we have operated
under <br>
difficulties acting under nuisance laws. Under the Public Health
laws in <br>
New York, we can fix a penalty for maintaining a public nuisance.
We have <br>
in a few instances removed Marihuana from private property where
the <br>
owner wouldn't undertake it himself, and then assessed a lien
against the <br>
property within the Public Health law on the ground that we have
removed <br>
a public nuisance.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It might be construed to apply to Marihuana under our
<br>
Public Health regulations in Wisconsin. I do not know whether it
has been <br>
discussed or not.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Robinson, we would like to hear from <br>
you.<br>
