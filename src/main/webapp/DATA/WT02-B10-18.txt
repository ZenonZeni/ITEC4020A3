Canada Cuts DAHI Second-Quarter Loss</b></font></h1>
<h1 align="center"><font size="4"><i>First Complete Quarter of
Veterinary Pharmaceutical Sales</i></font></h1>
<p><b>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, August 15, 1996</b> -- Deprenyl
Animal Health, Inc. (NASD OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI; Toronto Stock
Exchange: DAH) today reported total revenue of $75,114, including
$48,132 from the sale of its veterinary pharmaceutical
Anipryl&#174; for the three months ended June 30, 1996. DAHI had
total revenue of $22,077, all from investment income, for the
comparable three months of 1995. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. continues to fund research for
additional indications of Anipryl&#174; in geriatric dogs. It
reported a net loss of $659,748, or 9 cents per share, for the
1996 second quarter, compared with a net loss of $758,639, or 12
cents per share, for the 1995 second quarter. </p>
<p>Six months' revenues for 1996 were $890,326, which included
one-time revenues from the sale of distribution rights for
Anipryl&#174; in Canada to Draxis Health Inc. (NASDAQ: DRAXF;
TSE: DAX) and a milestone payment from Hoechst Veterinar GmbH.
The net loss for the six months ended June 30, 1996 was $443,318,
or 6 cents per share, versus $1.4 million, or 21 cents per share,
for the six months ended June 30, 1995. </p>
<p>Anipryl&#174; is approved in Canada for treatment of canine
Cushing's disease. The company is awaiting action from the U.S.
Food &amp; Drug Administration on its canine Cushing's disease
application, which was submitted in September 1995. Approximately
165,000 cases of canine Cushing's disease are diagnosed each year
in Canada and the U.S. </p>
<p>DAHI is also awaiting action from the Canadian Health
Protection Branch, Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, on its application
to market Anipryl&#174; for cognitive dysfunction. Approximately
150,000 cases of cognitive dysfunction occur in Canada each year.
The company continues its U.S. Phase III-equivalent clinical
trial for Anipryl&#174; as a treatment for cognitive dysfunction,
which occurs in approximately 1.5 million older dogs each year. </p>
<p>During July 1996, the board of directors of Deprenyl Animal
Health, Inc. recommended the acceptance of an offer by Draxis to
acquire the shares of DAHI not already owned by Draxis through a
friendly tender offer. Draxis currently owns 44 percent of the
outstanding common shares of DAHI, as well as DAHI convertible
debt that, if converted, would result in an increase of Draxis'
holdings in DAHI to 52 percent. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the transaction, Draxis would exchange 1.35
shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of DAHI not
already owned by Draxis. Special meetings of the shareholders of
the two companies will be held in the fall to vote on the
transaction. </p>
<p>Draxis Health Inc., based in suburban Toronto, Ontario, is a
leading Canadian pharmaceutical company focused on neurology,
dermatology and veterinary markets in Canada and the United
States. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health was established in 1990 to develop
animal health applications for Anipryl&#174;. The Company is also
identifying other animal health product opportunities to become a
multi-product animal health pharmaceutical company. </p>
