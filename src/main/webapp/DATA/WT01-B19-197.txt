<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Qualifies For
November Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California's Medical Marijuana Initiative has qualified for the November
general election.&nbsp; The Secretary of State's office in
Sacramento certified the initiative measure which will allow
California voters the opportunity to legalize marijuana for
medical use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative, which gathered 775,000 signatures to qualify for
ballot access, provides that &quot;patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from general
provisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession or
cultivation of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It also provides that
&quot;physicians shall not be punished or denied any right or
privilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This measure will not legalize or otherwise change existing law
against use, sale, or possession of marijuana for recreational
use, proponents note.&nbsp; It will prevent the criminal
prosecution of those patients who have a legitimate medical need
to use marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although more research is needed, it is clear from both available
studies and rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that
marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patients
with a number of serious ailments including cancer, spastic
disorders, glaucoma, and the appetite loss associated with the
wasting syndrome of AIDS. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This proposition would not have been necessary if Gov.
[Pete] Wilson had not vetoed S.B. 1364 in 1994 and A.B. 1529 in
1995,&quot; said longtime marijuana activist Dennis Peron,
referring to two prior medical marijuana bills that were passed
by the California legislature.&nbsp; &quot;This whole issue is
more about compassion than marijuana.&nbsp; I think it's time to
let doctor's decide, not politicians.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Victorian Politicians Reject Marijuana
Decriminalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, Victoria, Australia:</b>&nbsp;
Victorian politicians failed to endorse one of the chief recommendations
of Professor David Pennington -- head of Premiere Jeff Kennett's
advisory council on drug reform -- who concluded that the
decriminalization of marijuana for cultivation and personal use
would be an effective step in steering individuals away from hard
drugs.&nbsp; Just prior to the Kennett Government's decision,
Pennington had warned Parliament that the implementation of the
council's findings without marijuana decriminalization would be
&quot;very much a second-best answer.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The government firmly believes that before the
decriminalization of marijuana is considered further, a better
coordinated, better resources, more innovative and carefully
focused education, treatment, and law enforcement strategy should
be given a chance to work,&quot; stated a press release from the
Victorian Cabinet. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The Premier's 'firm belief' ... is laughable,&quot;
responded Jamnes Danenberg of HEMP SA, spokesman for a leading
Australian cannabis law reform lobby group.&nbsp; &quot;Just how
many more people need to be convicted [under prohibition] before
the right signal is sent?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For months Victorian politicians had been debating over whether
to implement many of the 72 major drug reforms suggested by the
Drug Advisory Council report, the most controversial being marijuana
decriminalization.&nbsp; In all, the Kennett government approved
a majority of the report's policies, including shifting the state
anti-drug focus to education rather than enforcement, but rejected
taking any steps toward decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The
government did conclude, however, that it &quot;will review
penalties applying to the use and possession of drugs of
dependence to ensure that users are treated as having a health
problem first and as criminal offenders second and that
treatment, rather than punishment, is the priority.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the subject of marijuana decriminalization is
a serious topic of debate among Australian politicians is a
positive note for drug-reform advocates everywhere,&quot; noted
NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;On the other
hand, it indicates just how far behind the United States is
lagging compared to other western nations when it comes to
addressing the issue of alternative drug policies.&nbsp;
Certainly, our own politicians would be well advised to heed the recommendations
the Pennington Report.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Environmentalists Voice Concern Over State's
Decision<br>
To Spray Marijuana With Pesticides</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 11, 1996, Tulsa, OK:</b>&nbsp; Oklahoma
narcotics officers and area environmentalists are clashing over
the state's decision to begin spraying pesticides on wild
marijuana plants in five counties.&nbsp; Authorities argue that
the spraying will deter people from cultivating, selling, and
smoking marijuana, but environmentalists are concerned that the
chemicals could pose potential heath hazards to both the
environment and the population. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Approximately 15 to 30 narcotics agents will begin spraying
uncultivated marijuana plants with glyphosate, a chemical weed
killer commonly marketed under the brand name
&quot;Round-Up.&quot;&nbsp; State officials claim that spraying
is the most effective way to eradicate uncultivated marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The herbicide has been tested, found to be safe and has a
very low toxicity to wildlife,&quot; said Oklahoma Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs spokesman Mark Woodward to the
Tulsa World News.&nbsp; To enforce his position, Woodward noted a
1986 U.S. Department of Justice study that showed an individual
could smoke 139 marijuana cigarettes treated with glyphosate a
day and still be under the safe level in regard to the
chemical.&nbsp; However, some area environmental activists are
not convinced. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our bio-diversity;
this can wreak damage on our wildflower population,&quot;
contested Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw Institute Inc., a
state organization that works to strengthen environmental
laws.&nbsp; Berry also cited a Journal of Pesticide Reform report
from last year that claimed glyphosate exposure was the third
most commonly reported of pesticide illness among agricultural
workers in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Maybe the state should get into the dandelion eradication
business, if it's busy work they want,&quot; Berry suggested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This will mark the third year the bureau has sprayed uncultivated
marijuana crops. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana User, Activist To Be
Arraigned On Felony Marijuana Charge</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, St. Paul, MN:</b>&nbsp;
Longtime medical marijuana user and activist Darrel Paulsen will
be arraigned on June 24 in connection with a September 1995 raid
on his residence by agents from the East Metro Drug Task
Force.&nbsp; Paulsen has been charged with felony possession of marijuana
in the fifth degree. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An outspoken advocate for medical marijuana, Paulsen has
acknowledged to using marijuana as a means to control his
cerebral palsy.&nbsp; He has been featured on local news
telecasts, spoken at national gatherings, and is currently
running for city council.&nbsp; Paulsen tells <b>NORML</b> that
he intends to request a postponement at his arraignment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Paulsen has publicly said that he uses marijuana daily for
medical purposes.&nbsp; Approximately two ounces of marijuana
were confiscated during the fall raid. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Paulsen encourages other activists to contact Assistant District
Attorney Stuart Shapiro and voice their disapproval over the
city's decision to file charges in this matter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this case, please contact Allen St.
Pierre of NORML @ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp; To contact the assistant
district attorney's office, please call (612) 438-4438. Paulsen's

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Rules On Traffic Stops</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 11, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Minor traffic stops can be used as justification for detaining
motorists and searching their vehicles for drugs, ruled the
Supreme Court in an unanimous decision.&nbsp; Critics argue that
the ruling will encourage police to use phony pretexts to invade
the privacy of motorists -- particularly minorities -- while
proponents maintain that it provides law enforcement with an
additional weapon to combat illicit drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is an opinion that essentially allows police to do an
end run around the Fourth Amendment,&quot; said Steven R. Shapiro
of the American Civil Liberties Union.&nbsp; He warned that the judgment
will most likely subject motorists to arbitrary stops. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The Supreme Court has announced to the world, 'We don't
care what the method is, so long as the search can be justified
in hindsight,'&quot; agreed Natman Schaye, a Tucson Arizona
lawyer who filed an amicus brief for the defendants on behalf of
the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Officers are still bound by the same rules that they were
bound by yesterday,&quot; countered Jim Pasco, executive director
of the Fraternal Order of Police, who applauded the
decision.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's an affirmation of the manner
in which good and innovative police officers are already
conducting themselves.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Anton Scalia affirmed
that ulterior motives do not strip officers of their
justification for a stop as long as a traffic violation has
occurred.&nbsp; &quot;For the run of the mine case, ... [the
Court] think[s] there is no alternative to the traditional common
law rule that probable cause justifies a search and
seizure.&quot;&nbsp; The case is <i>Whren v. United States</i>.</p>
