Terms of Service Agreement</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>1. Terms of Service Agreement and Rules of the Road.</STRONG> The
America Online service (&quot;AOL&quot;) is provided by America Online Inc.
(&quot;America Online,&quot; &quot;AOL Inc.&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) to
you (&quot;Member&quot; or &quot;you&quot;), subject to the terms of this
Agreement and AOL Inc.s operating policy, which is incorporated herein and
referred to as the &quot;Rules of the Road&quot; or &quot;ROR&quot; and
shall be collectively referred to as &quot;TOS.&quot; (The TOS may be accessed
using KEYWORD TOS.) The TOS comprises the entire agreement between AOL Inc.
and you, and supersedes any prior agreements between you and AOL Inc. with
respect to the subject matter of the TOS; provided, however, that you shall
be subject to any additional terms and conditions which you are notified
of and which may apply when using third party content, software or services.
AOL Inc. may revise the TOS at any time, and such revision shall be effective
thirty (30) days upon posting the revised TOS in the Terms of Service section
of the Member Services Area (KEYWORD TOS), which will include notice of
the date of the last TOS modification (&quot;Notice&quot;). You agree to
review the TOS periodically to be aware of such revisions. If any such revision
is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your membership as provided in
Section 9 below. Your continued use of AOL following notice of any such
revision to the TOS shall be conclusively deemed acceptance of all such
revisions. <A NAME="tos2"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>2. Account Info. </STRONG>YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN
YEARS OLD. By registering as a Member, you will receive a password and a
master account (&quot;Master Account&quot;). You are entirely liable for
all activities conducted through your Master Account and any sub-accounts
or screen-names under your Master Account (&quot;Sub-Accounts&quot;). (A
Member may permit another individual, including a minor, to use the Members
Account or Sub-Accounts subject to Member supervision and with assumption
of all resulting liabilities.) You agree to provide AOL Inc. with accurate,
complete, and updated registration information, and failure to do so shall
constitute a breach of this Agreement and unauthorized access to AOL, and
may result in immediate termination of your account and subject you to civil
and/or criminal liability. You may not select or use a screen name of another
person (unless its also your name), or a name in violation of the intellectual
property rights of any person other than you, or a screen name that AOL
Inc. deems offensive.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>3. Charges.</STRONG> Current rates and surcharges for using AOL
may be obtained by calling AOL Inc.s Customer Service at 800-827-6364 or
by selecting &quot;Billing&quot; under &quot;Member Services&quot; (KEYWORD:
BILLING). AOL Inc.s billing practices are explained under &quot;Explain
Billing Terms.&quot; AOL Inc. reserves the right to change its fees and
billing methods at any time effective thirty (30) days after Notice. If
any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your Membership
as provided in Section 9 below. Your continued use of AOL following any
such change shall be deemed acceptance of such change. Your monthly membership
fee is payable in advance and is not refundable in whole or part. You are
responsible for all charges associated with connecting to AOL. Depending
on your particular location, the nearest access number may or may not be
a local phone call. You should confirm that such access number is a local
call with your phone company. Members accessing AOL from outside the 48
contiguous United States may be assessed communication surcharges on your
AOL bill, which apply even if you are using your trial hours. You are responsible
for all activities and charges under your Master Account and Sub-account(s),
including any unauthorized charges to your account. Each time you use AOL
you agree and reaffirm that AOL Inc. is authorized, as applicable, to charge
your designated card or withdraw funds via electronic funds transfer from
your checking account. You agree that if you want to see the detailed components
of accumulated charges you may do so by using KEYWORD: BILLING. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>4. Rights and Responsibilities. <BR>
<BR>
(a) Content </STRONG>You acknowledge that (i) AOL contains information,
communications, software, photos, video, graphics, music, sounds and other
material and services (collectively, &quot;Content&quot;), and (ii) such
Content is generally provided under license by independent content providers
(&quot;ICPs&quot;) and other AOL subscribers. Each Member and any user of
Members Master Account must evaluate, and bear the risk associated with,
the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any Content. AOL Inc. does not
pre-screen Content as a matter of policy, but AOL Inc. and ICPs shall have
the right, but not the responsibility, to remove Content which is deemed
in their discretion harmful, offensive, or otherwise in violation of the
TOS. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>(b) Rights. </STRONG>You acknowledge that (i) AOL permits access
to Content that is protected by copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary
(including intellectual property) rights (&quot;Rights&quot;), and (ii)
that these Rights are valid and protected in all media existing now or later
developed and (iii) except as is explicitly provided otherwise, your use
of Content shall be governed by applicable copyright and other intellectual
property laws. (See ROR for details.) You agree that you may upload to the
software files, message boards or otherwise transmit on or through AOL only
Content that is not subject to any Rights, or Content in which any holder
of Rights has given express authorization for distribution on AOL. Unless
specified otherwise in your upload, , by submitting Content to any &quot;Public
Area&quot; (e.g. public chat rooms, message boards, software libraries see
ROR for more details) you automatically grant -- or warrant that the owner
of such Content has expressly granted -- AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual,
irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify,
adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform
and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate
it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed
for the full term of any Rights that may exist in such Content.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>(c) Conduct and Communication. </STRONG>AOL Inc. may elect at its
sole discretion to monitor some, all or none of the Public Areas of AOL
for adherence to the TOS. You agree to use AOL only for lawful purposes.
Any conduct by a Member that in AOL Inc.s sole discretion restricts or inhibits
any other Member, person or entity from using or enjoying AOL or another
service will not be permitted and shall entitle AOL Inc. to immediately
terminate membership without notice. (See the ROR for examples of prohibited
conduct). For AOL Inc.'s policy on Member privacy, refer to Section 7 of
the ROR.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>5. International C&amp;S/Internet. <BR>
<BR>
(a) International Areas. </STRONG>You acknowledge that your use of AOL allows
access to Content originating from subscribers, ICPs and other third parties
located in countries other than the United States (&quot;International C&amp;S&quot;).
Your access to and use of the International C&amp;S will be governed (in
addition to this Agreement) by separate terms and operating policies which
conform to appropriate national laws and customs. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>(b) Internet. </STRONG>AOL offers Members access to the Internet.
The Internet is not owned, operated, managed by, or in any way affiliated
with, AOL Inc. or any of its affiliates. Your use of the Internet is solely
at your own risk and is subject to all applicable local, state, national
and international laws and regulations. AOL Inc. retains the right, but
not the obligation, in its sole discretion and without prior notice or liability,
to restrict or terminate a Members access to the Internet via AOL or to
AOL (See Sections C &amp; D of ROR for details). <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>6. AOL Software.</STRONG> AOL Inc. grants you a non-exclusive, limited
license to use the software through which you access AOL (&quot;AOL Software&quot;)
only for use in connecting to AOL from authorized locations in accordance
with this Agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>7. NO WARRANTY. </STRONG>MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF AOL,
AOL SOFTWARE, AOLS EMAIL SERVICES AND THE INTERNET ARE AT MEMBERS SOLE RISK.
AOL, AOLS EMAIL SERVICES AND AOL SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS,&quot;
&quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION. AOL
INC.s ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO USE OF
AOL AND AOL SOFTWARE SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF ANY DISKETTE FOUND TO BE
DEFECTIVE. AOL INC.s LIABILITY TO YOU FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED
SOLELY TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO ACCESS AND USE AOL. BECAUSE SOME STATES
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES AOL INC.s LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>8. Indemnification. </STRONG>Upon request of AOL Inc., Member agrees
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AOL Inc., its affiliated companies,
licensees and ICPs from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including
attorneys fees, arising from breach of the TOS by use of, or in connection
with, the transmission by or through Members Master Account or Sub-Accounts
of any Content on AOL. AOL Inc. reserves the right, at its own expense,
to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject
to indemnification by Member hereunder, and in such event, Member shall
have no further obligation to provide indemnification for such matter.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>9. Termination.</STRONG> Either Member or AOL Inc. may terminate
membership at any time. Members only right with respect to any dissatisfaction
with any (i) TOS term, or policy or practice of AOL Inc. in operating AOL,
(ii) Content available through AOL or change therein, or (iii) amount or
type of fees or billing methods, or change therein, is to terminate Membership
by delivering notice to AOL Inc. (KEYWORD: Cancel). Members notice of termination
will be effective upon receipt by AOL Inc. In the event that a Members account
is terminated or canceled, no refund of any fees, including monthly membership
fee, will be granted and any online time credited to Members account(s)
or Sub-Accounts is not convertible to cash or other form of credit.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>10. Law. </STRONG>To the extent of any conflict between this agreement
and the ROR, this agreement shall take precedence. Should any part of the
TOS be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent
with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions
of the parties and the remaining portions remain in full force and effect.
The TOS shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding
its conflicts of law rules, and Member and AOL Inc. each submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>America Online's<BR>
&quot;Rules of the Road&quot;</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>1. General</H3>
<BR>
A. These Rules of the Road (&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; or &quot;ROR&quot;)
set forth how America Online, Inc. will operate the America Online brand
interactive service and how authorized subscribers may use AOL. These ROR
also explain many practical aspects of using AOL. Please read this document
carefully and refer to it as often as necessary. You should also read and
refer to the Terms of Service Agreement (the &quot;TOS). This document,
and the TOS (which were available when you first signed on), are all of
the applicable AOL rules (&quot;AOL Rules&quot;), and, as stated in Section
1 of the TOS, comprise the entire agreement between you and AOL Inc. with
respect to AOL. You can view the TOS or this ROR on AOL at any time without
hourly usage charges in the &quot;Member Services&quot; area. Unless the
context requires otherwise, terms used in the ROR have the meanings given
in the TOS. <BR>
<BR>
B. We believe that our AOL Rules will enhance AOL Inc.s efforts to make
AOL informative, entertaining and, above all, FUN!! for all our Members.
We have tried to explain clearly our AOL Rules, but if any aspect of the
AOL Rules are unclear, we welcome your comments. We hope that our AOL Rules
will foster an online community where there is both free exchange of ideas
and information, and respect for individual and community rights. 
<H3>2. Accessing and Using AOL</H3>
<STRONG>A. Access. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) Equipment. Most Members will access AOL through a standard residential
telephone line, a modem, and a personal computer that you are responsible
for providing. (Please remember that when you are connected to AOL, your
telephone or other communications equipment, e.g., fax, cannot be operated
on the same line at the same time.) There are a variety of personal computers
that are capable of accessing and using AOL. For specific technical questions,
use the keyword &quot;TechLive.&quot; TechLive is currently open from 8
a.m. to 4 a.m. (Eastern time) seven days a week. Access numbers used to
connect to AOL may be owned or operated by independent network service providers
other than AOL Inc. If you are accessing AOL from outside the Continental
United States you may be assessed communications surcharges, the amount
of which is available by accessing keyword &quot;Billing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
(ii) Telephone Charges. You are responsible for all telephone charges incurred
in connecting to AOL through an available access number. Depending on your
particular location, the nearest access number is usually, but not always,
a local telephone call. To find additional or closer access numbers use
keyword &quot;Access.&quot; If you have any questions about which telephone
number is best or whether an access number is a local call, please check
with your telephone service provider. Any disputes or problems regarding
phone service are strictly between Member and the applicable telephone and/or
long distance service provider. <BR>
<BR>
If you cannot currently find an access number that is a local call, check
the &quot;New Access Number Updates,&quot; which is updated monthly and
available in the Member Services area. (We are continuously expanding the
list of local numbers.) You can also call your long-distance telephone company
to see if a calling plan is available to allow you to call a long-distance
access number for a flat rate, or to purchase blocks of calling time in
advance at a discount. Members who do not have access to a local number
can also use &quot;AOLnet 800 Number Access,&quot; an 800 number operated
by AOL Inc., for a small surcharge rather than pay expensive long distance
phone bills. <BR>
<BR>
(iii) AOL Software. Under Section 6 of TOS, AOL Inc. grants to you a limited
license to use the AOL Software to connect to AOL from authorized locations.
This license is subject to the restriction, that except to the extent expressly
permitted by law, you may not translate, reverse engineer or reverse compile
or decompile, disassemble or make derivative works from AOL Software. You
may not modify AOL Software in any manner or form, or use it in any way
which is not expressly authorized in the AOL Rules, including without limitation
for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to AOL (e.g., hacking).
You agree to abide by the U.S. and other applicable export control laws
and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content
which is subject to restrictions under such laws to a national or destination
restricted under such laws without first obtaining and then complying with
any requisite government authorization.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Your AOL Account. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE TO REGISTER FOR AOL
AND OBTAIN A MEMBERS MASTER ACCOUNT; HOWEVER, A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN
MAY AUTHORIZE A MINOR TO USE HIS/HER MASTER ACCOUNT(S) UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION.
In cases where you have authorized another individual, including a minor,
to use your account, you recognize that you are fully responsible for the
online conduct of such user, and for controlling the users access to and
use of AOL, and for the consequences of any misuse, and that the holder
of the Members Master Account(s) is entirely responsible for activities
conducted through those accounts (see Section 4c of the TOS). You acknowledge
that some areas of AOL may contain material that is inappropriate for minors.
AOL offers a &quot;Parental Control&quot; feature that enables the Master
Account holder to restrict access to certain areas and features on AOL,
but makes no warranties with respect to such feature. Please refer to the
Parental Control area in the Member Services area for an explanation of
this feature.<A NAME="ror2bii"></A><BR>
<BR>
(ii) Upon your enrollment as a Member, you will select a unique password.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password
and are liable for any harm resulting from disclosing or allowing disclosure
of any password or from use by any person of your password to gain access
to the Members Master Account(s) or any Sub-Accounts. Therefore, for security
purposes, we recommend that you change your password often. (You can do
this by entering the &quot;Change Your Personal Password&quot; area in the
Member Services area.) At no time should a Member ever respond to an online
request for a password. Employees from AOL Inc. will never ask for a Members
password online. Although AOL offers a feature that allows you to bypass
the password protection, please remember that this feature permits anyone
who has access to your computer to easily access your Master Account and
or Sub-Accounts. Use of this password bypass feature is at Members own risk.
YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR MASTER ACCOUNT AND/OR SUB-ACCOUNTS,
INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES TO THOSE ACCOUNTS.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Current rates for using AOL may be obtained by calling AOL Inc.s Customer
Service at 800-827-6364 or by selecting &quot;Billing&quot; under &quot;Member
Services.&quot; (Members can also access this area directly by using the
keyword &quot;Billing.&quot;) An explanation of AOL Inc.s billing practices
is provided under the category &quot;Explain Billing Terms.&quot; Such rates
are expressed net of and Member shall pay in addition to them, all sales,
use, value-added, personal property or other governmental tax or levy imposed
on the goods or services billed to his/her Master Account(s), other than
taxes based on net income or profits of AOL Inc. If the payment method for
your Membership is by credit card and payment is not received by AOL Inc.
from the card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon
demand by AOL Inc. Each time you use AOL you agree and reaffirm that AOL
Inc. is authorized to charge your designated card or withdraw funds via
electronic funds transfer (&quot;EFT&quot;) from your checking account,
if applicable. Your card issuers agreement governs your use of your designated
card in connection with AOL, and you must refer to such agreement and not
this Agreement with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
You agree that AOL Inc. may, at its option, accumulate charges incurred
during your billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges
during or at the end of each cycle for EFT from your checking account or
credit card as applicable, meaning that accumulated charges may appear on
the statement you receive from your bank or card issuer. Further, you agree
that AOL Inc. may delay obtaining authorization from your card issuer until
submission of the accumulated charges. You agree that if you want to see
the components of accumulated charges you may do so by using Keyword &quot;Billing.&quot;
If AOL Inc. does not receive the full amount of your AOL account balance
within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, an additional 1.5% (or the
highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month late charge
will be added to your bill and shall immediately become due and payable.
Member shall also be liable for all attorney and collection fees arising
from AOL Inc.s efforts to collect any unpaid balance of your Master Account(s).
AOL Inc. will provide you with an online statement of charges if requested
by using Keyword &quot;Billing.&quot; Unless you notify AOL Inc. of any
discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your account statement,
they will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes, including resolution
of inquiries made by your card issuer. You release AOL Inc. from all liabilities
and claim of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy that is not reported
to AOL Inc. within 90 days of its publication.<A NAME="ror2biv"></A><BR>
<BR>
(iv) Upon your registration with AOL, you must choose one or more screen
names to identify yourself on AOL. AOL Inc. encourages you to be creative
and have fun with the screen names you choose, but you are also expected
to be reasonable and responsible; vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names
can offend the sensibilities of many Members, and it is only common courtesy
to remember this when you are selecting screen names. You may not select
or use a screen name of another person (unless its also your name), or a
name which violates a trademark right, copyright, or any other proprietary
right, or which AOL Inc. deems in its discretion to be vulgar or otherwise
offensive. If you are unsure about a screen name, send us an email using
the &quot;Write to Community Action Staff&quot; button under keyword &quot;TOS,&quot;
and select the &quot;Names/Profiles Violations&quot; button. Unfortunately,
some Members occasionally select vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names
as a joke, or just a momentary lapse of good judgment. AOL Inc. reserves
the right to delete any such screen name, or to request deletion.<BR>
<BR>
(v) Unless you have written authorization from AOL Inc., you may not register
for additional Master Accounts. Any delinquent or unpaid accounts or accounts
with unresolved issues with the Community Action Department or other AOL
departments must be concluded before you may re-register with AOL Inc. Members
using multiple accounts without express permission from AOL Inc. shall be
terminated.<BR>
<BR>
(vi) Members whose accounts have been terminated by AOL Inc. may not access
AOL in any manner or for any reason without the express written permission
of AOL Inc. Active AOL Members may not knowingly allow former Members who
have been terminated to use their accounts.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. Online Conduct. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(a) Any conduct by you that in AOL Inc.s discretion restricts or inhibits
any other Member from using or enjoying AOL will not be permitted and may
result in termination of Membership. You agree to use AOL only for lawful
purposes. You may not post or use AOL to: <BR>
<BR>
(1) harass, threaten, embarrass or cause distress, unwanted attention or
discomfort upon another Member or user of AOL or other person or entity,
<BR>
(2) post or transmit sexually explicit images or other content which is
deemed by AOL Inc. to be offensive, <BR>
(3) transmit any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory,
vulgar, obscene, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable
Content,<BR>
(4) cause the screen to &quot;scroll&quot; faster than other Members or
users are able to type to it or any action to a similar disruptive effect,
<BR>
(5) impersonate any person, including but not limited to, an AOL Inc. official
or an information provider, forum leader, guide or host, or communicate
under a false name or a name that you are not entitled or authorized to
use, <BR>
(6) disrupt the normal flow of dialogue in a chat room or otherwise act
in a manner that negatively affects other Members, users, individuals or
entities, <BR>
(7) post or transmit chain letters or pyramid schemes, <BR>
(8) post or transmit any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials,
or other forms of solicitation to other Members, individuals or entities,
except in those areas (e.g., the classified areas) that are designated for
such a purpose,<BR>
(9) violate any operating rule, policy or guideline of any other interactive
service, including but not limited to the operating policies of the International
Areas, or <BR>
(10) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state,
national or international law, including but not limited to any regulations
having the force of law. <BR>
<BR>
(i) Offensive Communication. AOL is a community-oriented service composed
of many different communities of people. Our goal is to provide an interesting,
stimulating and fun place for all Members. Using vulgar, abusive or hateful
language undermines this goal and is not allowed. Please use your best judgment
and be respectful of other Members. Remember, there may be children online.
If you use vulgar, or abusive language online, even if masked by symbols
or other characters, you may either receive an &quot;on-screen-warning&quot;
by a Guide or Room Host, or in some cases be terminated immediately. A warning
indicates that your language is not in compliance with the TOS or ROR. Should
you receive such a warning, take the time to read the AOL Rules again, comprising
the TOS and these ROR which you will find posted in the Member Services
area.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Harassment. When a Member targets another individual or entity to cause
distress, embarrassment, unwanted attention, or other discomfort, this is
harassment. AOL Inc. does not condone harassment in any form and may suspend
or terminate the accounts of any Member who harasses others. You may have
a disagreement with someone's point of view -- we encourage lively discussion
in our chat rooms and message boards -- but personal attacks, or attacks
based on a persons race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, disablement or other such affiliation, are prohibited. If you
have a disagreement with someone's point of view, address the subject, not
the person.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Graphic Files. AOL Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on AOL of
sexually explicit images or other content deemed offensive by AOL Inc.<BR>
<BR>
(iv) Scrolling. &quot;Scrolling&quot; means repeatedly causing the screen
to roll faster than Members are able to type to it. It is caused by a user
entering a set of random characters or by repeatedly entering a carriage
return or any such action to a similar disruptive effect. Scrolling is an
expressly prohibited form of disruption.<BR>
<BR>
(v) Impersonation. This can involve the portrayal of another person or entity,
such as the impersonation of AOL Inc. staff or an information provider,
authorized Guide or Host, or communication under a false name or a name
that you are not authorized to use. Members must avoid the portrayal of
AOL Inc. personnel or others persons in all forms of online communication,
including, but not limited to, screen names, member profiles, chat dialogue
and message postings.<BR>
<BR>
(vi) Room Disruption. This includes purposefully interfering with the normal
flow of dialogue in a chat room. Room disruption may occur by repeatedly
interrupting conversation between Members, or by acting in such a way as
to antagonize, harass or create hostility in a chat room.<BR>
<BR>
(vii) Chain Letters and Pyramid Schemes. Transmission of chain letters and
pyramid schemes of any kind is not allowed on AOL. This material places
an unnecessary load on our electronic mail (&quot;email&quot;) system and
is considered a nuisance by many Members. Certain chain letters and pyramid
schemes are illegal. Letters or messages that offer a product or service
based on the structure of a chain letter are also of questionable legality.
At minimum, they are a waste of resources and are not permitted on AOL.<BR>
<BR>
(viii) Advertising, Solicitation and Name Harvesting. You may not use AOL
to send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms of
solicitation to other Members except in those specified areas that are designated
for such a purpose (e.g., the classified area) unless you receive the express
permission of the Member. You may not use AOL to collect or &quot;harvest&quot;
screen names of other Members without the express prior permission of the
Member. AOL Inc. reserves the right to block or filter mass email solicitations
on or through AOL.<BR>
<BR>
If you witness chat in a public chat room that violates the AOL Rules, you
may contact an AOL Service Guide by using the keyword &quot;Guide Pager.&quot;
You may also contact AOL Inc.s Community Action Staff about any violation
by using the &quot;Write to Community Action Staff&quot; icon located in
the TOS area of the Members Services area. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>D. Content. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You recognize that communication over AOL often occurs in real-time, or
is posted on one of AOLs thousands of message boards or libraries, and AOL
Inc. cannot, and does not intend to, screen communication in advance. Moreover,
because AOL Inc. encourages open and candid communication, it cannot determine
in advance the accuracy, or conformance to the AOL Rules, of Content transmitted
on AOL. AOL Inc. is not responsible for screening, policing, editing, or
monitoring such Content. If notified of Content which is alleged not to
conform to the AOL Rules, AOL Inc. may investigate the allegation and determine
in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the
removal of such Content from AOL. AOL Inc. shall have no liability or responsibility
to you in respect of its performance or non-performance by AOL Inc. of such
activities, as long as it has acted in good faith.<BR>
<BR>
Please use your best judgment in evaluating all information contained or
opinions expressed on AOL. You should be no less careful in your evaluation
of such information and opinions on AOL as you are in everyday life. It
is AOL Inc.s policy not to endorse, oppose, or edit any opinion expressed
by a Member or information or material provided by an ICP or other independent
party.<BR>
<BR>
All Content is protected by copyright pursuant to U.S., international conventions,
and other copyright laws as a collective work and/or compilation, and AOL
Inc. owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement and enhancement
of such Content. You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the
transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided below), create derivative
works from, distribute, perform, display or in any way exploit, any of the
Content, in whole or in part; provided that if no specific restrictions
are applied directly or indirectly in relation to a particular item of Content,
you may make a reasonable number of copies of such item, including copyright
material, provided that the copies are made and used only for your personal
use and that you ensure that any notices contained in the Content such as
all copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights notices are reproduced
in an unmodified form in all such copies. <BR>
<BR>
You may upload to AOLs software files and message boards or otherwise transmit
on or through AOL only Content that is not subject to any copyright or other
proprietary rights protection (collectively, &quot;Public Domain Content&quot;),
or Content in respect of which the holder of any copyright, trademark or
other proprietary rights (&quot;Rights&quot;) has given express authorization
for distribution on AOL without any restriction whatsoever, and in respect
of which any moral rights of any person or entity have been completely and
irrevocably waived. Any copyright Content submitted with the consent of
a copyright owner other than you should contain a phrase such as &quot;Copyright
owned by [name of the owner]; Used by Permission.&quot; The unauthorized
submission of copyright or Content which is otherwise subject of any third
party Rights constitutes a breach of the AOL Rules and may also render you
liable to the holder of such rights. Remember you, not AOL Inc. or its affiliates
or independent contractors (such as Independent Content Providers or &quot;ICPs&quot;),
are exclusively responsible for any liability resulting from infringement
of Rights arising from such submission or transmission.<BR>
<BR>
By posting shareware or other software to AOLs file libraries, you authorize
AOL to distribute the software through its worldwide network. You may provide
for additional license terms and restrictions in your upload, but AOL shall
have no obligation whatsoever with respect to enforcing such terms and conditions
and reserves the right to remove any software from its network, at its sole
discretion.<BR>
<BR>
By submitting Content to any &quot;Public Area&quot; (Public Area(s) are
those areas of AOL that are generally accessible to other Members, such
as public chat rooms, message boards, and file uploads) you are deemed automatically
to grant -- and/or warrant that the holder of any Rights or Moral Rights
in such Content has completely and effectively waived all such Moral Rights
and expressly, validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant
-- AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right
(including any moral rights) and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt,
publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and
display the Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it
in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter
developed for the full term of any Rights that may exist in such Content.
You also permit any Member to access, view, store and reproduce the Content
for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the owner of Content placed
on AOL retains any and all rights which may exist in such Content.<BR>
<BR>
The export control laws of the United States and other jurisdictions regulate
the export and re-export of certain technology. This includes the electronic
transmission of certain information and software to particular foreign countries
and foreign nationals. You agree to abide by these laws -- including but
not limited to the United States Export Administration Act, Arms Export
Control Act and their implementing regulations -- and not to transfer, by
electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from AOL which
is governed by or regulated under such laws to a national or a destination
prohibited or restricted under such laws without first obtaining any required
governmental authorization. You further agree not to upload to AOL any data
or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization,
including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software. This
assurance and commitment shall survive termination of the Agreement. In
addition, because U.S. export control laws currently prohibit nationals
of Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria from gaining access to certain
Content on AOL, nationals of these countries currently may not legally access
AOL.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>E. Internet Access and Conduct.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
AOL provides you with access to the Internet. Generally, the Internet consists
of the following areas available through AOL: Email, News Groups, Gopher
and WAIS, FTP, and the World Wide Web (See the &quot;Internet Connection&quot;
area on AOL). You are connected to the Internet via the World Wide Web (&quot;Web&quot;)
whenever there appears, on the right hand corner of the screen display,
the spinning AOL triangular logo. The Internet is not owned, or operated
by, or in any way affiliated with, AOL Inc. or any of its affiliates; it
is a separate, independent network of computers and is not part of AOL.
You use of the Internet is solely at your own risk. When using the Internet
and all of its components, Members must conduct themselves responsibly according
to the Internets own particular code of conduct. Participating successfully
on the Internet is really a matter of common sense. Although AOL Inc. does
not control the Internet, your conduct on the Internet when using your AOL
account is subject to the AOL Rules. Because AOL Inc. wants to be a good
Internet citizen, it prohibits Members from engaging in certain conduct
on the Internet through or by means of AOL including the following:<BR>
<BR>
(i) Chain Letters. Chain letters are prohibited on AOL and are inappropriate
on the Internet. Posting a chain letter to an Internet newsgroup (or via
email on the Internet) may result in your AOL account being terminated.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Commercial Communication. The vast majority of newsgroups and mailing
lists on the Internet are not commercial in nature and participants in such
groups may object strongly to commercial postings, solicitations, or advertisements.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Other Inappropriate Posts. Each newsgroup and mailing list on the
Internet focuses on a particular set of topics and posts not related to
these topics are not welcomed by the participants. We suggest that all Members
become familiar with the guidelines, themes, and culture of the specific
newsgroups and mailing list in which they wish to participate. Posting or
distributing patently inappropriate material on the Internet (i.e. spamming
or mail bombing) may result in suspension or termination of your AOL Master
Account and Sub-Accounts.<BR>
<BR>
(iv) Copyright and Proprietary Materials. Transmitting to the Internet copyright
or other material of any kind which is subject to the Rights of any person
or entity without the express permission of the Rights holder is prohibited
and will result in termination of your Membership and possible civil and/or
criminal liability.<BR>
<BR>
(v) Use of Personal Publishing Tools. AOL Inc. provides Members with personal
publishing tools to enable Members to create personal homepages (Keyword:
Personal Publisher) and use of such publishing tools will be subject to
these ROR and TOS. AOL Inc. reserves the right to suspend or terminate at
its discretion Members AOL Master Accounts and Sub-Accounts or to require
the removal of links or other content on or through Members homepages or
personal Internet sites if providing such content or links causes undue
strain on any AOL server either through excessive hits or by excessive bandwidth.
<BR>
<BR>
You understand that except for Content, products or services expressly available
at AOL Inc.s Web site, neither AOL Inc. nor any of its affiliates controls,
provides, operates or is responsible for any Content, goods or services
available on the Internet. All such Content, goods and services are made
accessible on the Internet by independent third parties and are not part
of AOL or controlled by AOL Inc. AOL Inc. neither endorses nor is responsible
for the accuracy or reliability of such Content, goods or services. AOL
Inc. does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, usefulness, quality
or availability of any Content, goods or services available on the Internet,
which are the sole responsibility of such independent third parties, and
your use thereof is solely at your own risk. Neither AOL Inc. nor its affiliates
shall be held responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss
or damage caused or alleged to have been caused by your use of or reliance
on any Content, goods or services available on the Internet or a your inability
to access the Internet or any site on the Internet. The foregoing provisions
of this paragraph shall apply with equal force even where AOL features or
displays a link with any particular Web site.<BR>
<BR>
You should be aware that the Internet contains Content, goods and services
that you may find obscene, improper, hurtful or otherwise offensive and
that may not be suitable for certain Members or for minors who are accessing
the Internet through a Sub-Account or Master Account of yours. AOL Inc.
does not have the capability or right to monitor, or review, or restrict
any Content, goods or services made available by third parties on the Internet,
nor to edit or remove any such questionable Content after posting on the
Internet. In addition, you should be aware that the Internet provides access
to users who are not part of AOL and whose conduct and communication may
also be found to be harmful or offensive to Members or which would otherwise
breach the AOL Rules if they were subject to it. Since such users are not
Members of AOL, AOL Inc. does not have the right or capability to restrict
or review their conduct or communication. Accordingly, AOL Inc. and its
affiliates specifically disclaim any responsibility for (and under no circumstances
be liable for) any conduct, Content, goods and services available on or
through the Internet (including without limitation any part of the Web).
Although, AOL Inc. permits parents to restrict access through AOL to certain
material on the Internet (See KEYWORD and hereinafter &quot;PARENTAL CONTROL&quot;),
you acknowledge that Parental Control features are imperfect and you use
Parental Control features at your sole risk. AOL Inc. does not give any
warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any Parental
Control feature or service. <BR>
<BR>
You should be aware that much of the Content available on the Internet is
protected by copyright, trademarks, trade secrets and other Rights of the
independent third parties or their licensors who make such Content available
on the Internet. Members use of such Content will be subject to the specific
restrictions placed on such Content by the owners or licensors of the Rights
in such Content and all applicable laws and regulations.<BR>
<BR>
Your use of the Internet is subject to all applicable local, state, national
and international laws and regulations. Without limiting the other rights
available to AOL Inc. under the AOL Rules, AOL Inc. retains the right, but
not the obligation, in its sole discretion and without prior notice or liability,
to restrict and/or terminate your access to the Internet and AOL if your
use of the Internet violates any such laws or regulations, any prohibitions
upon your conduct in connection with the Internet raised in this Section
E or otherwise restricts or inhibits any other user from enjoying the Internet
or AOL.
<H3>3. Purchasing Products and Services through AOL</H3>
Please remember that AOL Inc. does not endorse, warrant or guarantee any
product or service offered through AOL and will not be a party to or in
any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of
products or services. As with the purchase of a product or service through
any medium or in any environment, you should use your best judgment and
exercise caution where appropriate. Blind opportunity ads and &quot;get
rich quick&quot; schemes should be approached with ample skepticism. AOL
Inc. cannot mediate disputes and cannot assume responsibility for any outcome.
Be careful, be smart, have fun!
<H3>4. Third Party Software and Services</H3>
In addition to content and services provided by Information Providers and
AOL Inc., other third parties may offer additional content, software or
other services to Members. Members may be subject to any additional terms
and conditions relating to the use of such third party content, software
or services and failure to abide by these terms and conditions may result
in termination of Membership. Furthermore, use of other networks, including
areas of the Internet, may be subject to any usage policies of such networks.
<H3>5. Public Communication </H3>
AOL offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally
accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member.
Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members,
such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards.
AOL Inc. will maintain AOL Public Areas as an open forum for discussion
of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc.
will administer standards of online conduct according to the AOL Rules for
the enjoyment of all its Members. While AOL Inc. will endeavor to monitor
the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL
Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in
the role of &quot;Big Brother&quot; by screening public communication in
advance.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content
on AOL which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to any Member, the
communities which comprise AOL, AOL Inc.s and third-parties rights, or to
violate applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc.
nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct,
communication or Content which might violate the AOL Rules prior to transmission
on AOL, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of actually or potentially
violating Content after online posting. Accordingly, you acknowledge that
neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume or have any liability
for any action or inaction by AOL Inc. or any ICP with respect to conduct,
communication or Content on AOL.
<H3>6. Customer Service Communication. </H3>
Please refer to Section 2B(iv) for AOL Inc.s policy on monitoring or disclosing
private communication. In order to ensure quality customer service, AOL
Inc. may monitor Member communication with AOL Inc. customer service employees,
including AOL Sales and Service, Tech Live and Community Action personnel.
<A NAME="ror7"></A>
<H3>7. Privacy Policy</H3>
<STRONG>A. General. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Because protecting your privacy is very important to America Online, we
have adopted the following policies to safeguard your personal information
and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection
and use of personal information or &quot;Individual Information&quot; (as
defined below) to what is necessary to administer our business, provide
you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think
will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information except
in limited circumstances as specifically provided below.<BR>
<BR>
Individual Information means any information, data or records which relate
to your AOL membership or use of AOL and identifies you or your individual
Member account. There are three types of Individual Information: (1) &quot;Member
Identity and Billing Information,&quot; such as your name, street address,
telephone number and billing information, and any screen names associated
with your account; (2) &quot;Navigational and Transactional Information,&quot;
such as information about where you go or what you buy through AOL; and
(3) &quot;Private Communications Content,&quot; such as the contents of
email, or private chat room or instant message communications. <BR>
<BR>
Please be aware that AOL is a private online service which allows access
to the Internet, but is not the Internet. AOL Inc. does not control the
content or services available through the Internet (except for the AOL and
GNN homepages), and providers of Internet sites or services have separate
data and privacy practices which are independent of AOL Inc. Internet areas
may appear to be seamlessly incorporated into AOL; however, currently, you
can tell youre on the Internet whenever there appears a spinning AOL logo,
or when you click on icons labeled as &quot;Newsgroups,&quot; &quot;Web,&quot;
&quot;Link,&quot; &quot;FTP,&quot; &quot;Gopher&quot; or other items relating
to the &quot;Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many of the online areas that you visit on AOL are operated by companies
that are independent from AOL Inc. While AOL Inc. will seek to require these
independent companies (e.g. information providers, advertisers, and merchants)
to adhere to our strong privacy principles, AOL Inc. does not bear responsibility
for their policies or actions. You should be aware that when you voluntarily
disclose personal information (such as your screen name) in public areas
(e.g., the Member Directory, chat rooms, message boards, Internet Newsgroups),
your information can be collected and used by others. (When you visit Internet
sites, your AOL screen name or other Member Identity Information is generally
not identifiable.) Also, ordering products through AOL often requires you
to provide an independent company with limited Individual Information to
enable them to fulfill and ship your order. <BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. actively participates in industry associations and community groups
to support strong and effective privacy guidelines and practices.<A NAME=
"ror7b"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Collection and Storage.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. We maintain the following types
of Member Identity and Billing Information: your name, street address, telephone
numbers, length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep
information on your communications with our Customer Service or Community
Action departments, and general account history, such as accumulated usage
credits, or written complaints relating to your account.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. We may collect and store
certain Navigational and Transactional Information, such as data on the
choices you make among the range of available services or merchandise and
the times and ways you use AOL.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. The AOL computer system does not record
or retain any chat room communications, instant message communications,
or records of with whom you communicate in chat rooms or instant messages.
<BR>
<BR>
The AOL email system retains the contents of private email communications
for a limited period only. Once read, email is permanently deleted from
the system after about five days. Email that is sent, but not read, is permanently
deleted from the system after about thirty days. (Consequently, if you wish
to keep copies of any communications, you should store such communications
on your personal computer hard drive or in print form.)<A NAME="ror7c"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. Use. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. safeguards its Members Individual Information from unauthorized
access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate
business functions are permitted access to Members Individual Information.
Employees who violate AOL Inc.s privacy policies are subject to disciplinary
actions, including termination where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
You acknowledge that private communications directed at a person or entity,
including AOL Inc., may be used or disclosed by the intended recipient(s)
without restrictions relating to privacy or confidentiality.<A NAME="ror7ci"></A><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing. AOL Inc. uses Member Identity and Billing
Information to administer our business, ensure that you are properly billed
and offer you opportunities that may be of interest.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. uses Navigational
and Transactional Information to personalize AOL and for programming and
editorial research. For example, we use Navigational and Transactional Information
to understand our members reactions to menu items, content, services and
merchandise offered through AOL and to customize AOL based on the interests
of our Members.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. treats private communications
on or through AOL as strictly confidential and does not access, use or disclose
the contents of private communications, except in limited circumstances
as specifically provided in Section 7D below. <A NAME="ror7d"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>D. Disclosure.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Because AOL Inc. considers the Individual Information we maintain to be
confidential, our policy is to not disclose Individual Information to third
parties without prior consent (which may be oral or electronic), or unless
specifically provided below. AOL Inc. reserves the right to use agents,
who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and
processing functions. <BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. From time to time, we make
our mailing list available to select companies that offer products and information
we think may be of interest to you. AOL Inc. carefully screens all requests
to use its mailing list to ensure that they are appropriate. AOL does not
release members telephone numbers, credit card numbers or checking account
numbers (or other Individual Information, such as Navigational or Transactional
Information or Private Communications Content). If you do not want your
name released to these companies, simply indicate this on the Member Mailing
Preferences Form. (To access this form, go to Keyword &quot;Member Preferences&quot;
-- then double-click on the heading &quot;Tell Us What Your Preferences
Are&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
It is our policy not to disclose to third parties Member Identity information
that links a Members screen name(s) with a Members actual name, unless required
to do so by law or legal process served on AOL Inc. (e.g., subpoena). AOL
Inc. reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional
circumstances (such as a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected
illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis and at AOL Inc.s sole discretion.
<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. intends to abide by applicable laws governing the disclosure to
governmental entities of Members Individual Information and other records.
When responding to legal process served on AOL Inc. by non-government entities,
unless otherwise ordered, AOL Inc.s current policy is to make reasonable
efforts to notify affected Member(s) in advance of releasing the information
in order to provide Member(s) an opportunity to pursue any available legal
protection.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. will not disclose
to third parties Navigational or Transactional Information (e.g. where you
go or what you buy on or through AOL), except to comply with applicable
law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant or court order). <A NAME=
"ror7diii"></A><BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. does not access or disclose
the contents of private communications (e.g., email, instant messages, member-created
private rooms), unless it in good faith believes that such action is necessary
(a) to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant
or court order), (b) to protect the rights or property of AOL Inc., or (c)
in emergencies when AOL Inc. believes that physical safety is at risk. AOL
Inc. reserves the right to treat as public, any private chat room whose
directory or room name is published or becomes generally known or available.
