<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Compassionate Use Club Founder
Arrested On Route To Rhode Island</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Longtime
activist and medical marijuana user Todd McCormick was arrested
and charged with two felony drug counts when Ohio State Highway
Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in
his van.&nbsp; McCormick's passenger, Natalie Byrd, was also
taken into custody and faces similar felony drug charges.&nbsp;
Both activists are currently being held at the Correction Center
of Northwest Ohio where bail has been set, without bond, at
$150,000 each. McCormick's preliminary hearing is scheduled to
take place today.&nbsp; Byrd's scheduled hearing has been
postponed to take place at a later date.&nbsp; McCormick, age 25, is
the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use Club.&nbsp; The
San Diego Club is one of approximately thirty Cannabis Buyers
Clubs located across the country.&nbsp; The purpose of the Clubs,
many of which have recently received favorable media coverage and
have been grudgingly tolerated by local law enforcement, is to
supply cannabis to seriously ill patients based upon a doctor's
recommendation.&nbsp; Typically, these patients are suffering
from the effects of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS),
glaucoma, and spinal disorders.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the marijuana found in his van was intended to be used to
establish a Compassionate Use Club in his home state of Rhode
Island.&nbsp; He told police that it was not for sale.&nbsp; All
of the cannabis dispensed at McCormick's San Diego Club was
donated and was available to patients on a &quot;no charge&quot;
basis.&nbsp; The 30+ pounds of cannabis was visibly labeled
&quot;for medical use.&quot;&nbsp; Based on the evidence seized during
McCormick's arrest in Ohio on the 18th, DEA agents subsequently
raided his Rolando, California house three days later.&nbsp; None
of the four residents staying at the house at the time of the raid
were arrested; however, a small quantity of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; Also confiscated by federal agents were videotapes,
books on the subject of legalizing marijuana, various computer
disks, film, and smoking paraphernalia.&nbsp; In addition,
numerous petition signatures calling for a California marijuana
legalization initiative were also seized, but have since been
returned.&nbsp; All four residents have said that they are
committed to making marijuana medically available to chronically
ill patients.&nbsp; Although the significant amount of marijuana
present and the rural venue do not make McCormick's case ideal
for a medical necessity defense, he feels that a number of Fourth Amendment
violations make his case winnable.&nbsp; Most importantly,
McCormick contends that law enforcement officials searched his
vehicle without his consent or a warrant.&nbsp; McCormick
maintains that one officer claimed to &quot;smell pot,&quot; at
which time McCormick voluntarily showed the trooper his
prescription for medical cannabis.&nbsp; At this point, his van
was searched and the bundles of marijuana were found.&nbsp;
McCormick acquired his prescription from a doctor in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Aside from being an activist on the front lines of the medical
marijuana issue, McCormick is also a medical marijuana
user.&nbsp; McCormick has battled cancer on ten different
occasions and first started smoking cannabis to alleviate the
significant side effects of radiation and chemotherapy.&nbsp; He now
uses the therapeutic effects of the drug to combat acute nerve
damage in his neck.&nbsp; This damage came about when the first
five vertebrae in his neck fused together as a result of the
cancer and greatly limits McCormick's lateral head
movement.&nbsp; McCormick attributes the regular smoking of
cannabis as the prime reason for the improvement in his condition
and lateral head mobility.&nbsp; He further maintains that the
prescription he acquired in the Netherlands makes it legal for
him to transport cannabis in all United Nations.&nbsp; Recently,
his prescription had enabled him to enter America through U.S.
Customs in Colorado while carrying cannabis.&nbsp; Those wishing

<p align="center"><b>Public Outage Inspires Oklahoma Governor To
Free Jimmy Montgomery</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the same time one medical marijuana user is
arrested, another is set free.&nbsp; Jimmy Montgomery, who was
re-sentenced on April 4 to serve ten years in prison for the
possession of less than two ounces of pot was released today
thanks to the hundreds of phone calls and letters from both
concerned <b>NORML</b> members and the press.&nbsp; Oklahoma
Governor Frank Keating signed his release citing Montgomery's
deteriorating health while in prison.</p>
