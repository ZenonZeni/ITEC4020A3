<P>
Spanning portions of nine South American nations, the Amazon is the largest remaining tropical rain forest on earth.  Its forests are home to the greatest variety of life on earth, including countless species that have yet to be discovered.  With 16 million inhabitants already living in the region, the Amazon remains Brazil's "last frontier".

Although more than 400,000
square kilometers of this tropical forest have fallen to logging,
mining, and other development schemes, the forest is so vast that
huge expanses of it remain comparatively untouched.  Support for
the region's indigenous people, who have conserved the area for
thousands of years, is key to preventing further destruction.

<P>CI has been working with the indigenous Kayap&oacute;
community on the 800,000 hectare Aukre Reservation for more than
five years, helping the people identify environmentally healthy
alternatives to goldmining and clear-cutting.  The diversified
economy that CI is helping to cultivate is already yielding benefits
for this forest society. In 1995 CI continued work that will establish
the community-managed Kayap&oacute; Center for Ecological Research
as a permanent base for programs in both scientific research and
ecotourism.  The community-owned &quot;air taxi&quot; became a
self-supporting enterprise, bringing scientists and officials
to the Kayap&oacute; Center.  CI's first ecotourism expedition
to the community is planned for 1996.     


<P>
The Kayap&oacute; team
organized and trained by CI is now preparing a zoning proposal
for the reservation.  Kayap&oacute; leaders are also trying to
convince nearby tribes to cooperate with Aukre in a joint plan
for sustainable management of Indian lands in the region.   

<P>
A
dramatic victory for conservation was achieved when 15 Kayap&oacute;
leaders outside Aukre made a collective decision to ban logging
and mining on their 10,000,000 hectare reservation.  This decision
was partly a reaction to the negative effects of miners and loggers
on Kayap&oacute; communities, where alcoholism and disease have
taken their toll.  But it was also inspired by CI's program in
Aukre. The enterprise of the Aukre Kayap&oacute; is becoming a
model for regionwide conservation strategy.
