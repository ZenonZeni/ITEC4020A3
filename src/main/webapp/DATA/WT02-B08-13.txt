CITIZEN ACTION EXPOSES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE 
IN ENCOURAGING OIL IMPORTS
</b>
<p>
</center>
Washington, D.C.-- Following Citizen Action's release of a new report, "Subsidizing Big Oil's Foreign Investments: Importing Oil, Exporting Jobs, and Making War," Renewable Fuels Association President Eric Vaughn applauded Citizen Action for shedding new light on government policies that exacerbate our growing dependence on imported energy.  "The important message from this report is that current federal policies are encouraging energy investments offshore at the expense of the domestic industry, effectively feeding our oil import habit.  It is analogous to the federal Drug Enforcement Agency buying the needles for a heroin addict," said Vaughn.
<p>
	The report examines three major federal subsidy programs, the foreign tax credit and other provisions of the U.S. tax code, the operation of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the military costs of protecting our access to Middle Eastern oil. The study finds that:
<p>
	"with oil company foreign tax credits totaling over $5 billion a year, with U.S. taxpayers on the line for nearly $8 billion worth of OPIC underwriting for the high-risk foreign ventures of U.S. oil companies and other multinationals, and with military expenditures of roughly $50 billion a year, the U.S. government is providing an expensive welfare program to encourage major U.S. international oil companies to find and develop foreign oil."
<p>
	"The U.S. should be encouraging domestic alternatives to imported oil, like ethanol, a clean-burning, renewable energy resource.  Instead, tax subsidies and provisions of the U.S. tax code provide incentives to turn abroad to satisfy our energy needs," said Vaughn.  "According to the Citizen Action report, the U.S. spends over $63 billion dollars a year on oil imports.  Factor that in together with foregone U.S. jobs and a stagnated domestic energy industry, and you have a recipe for disaster," continued Vaughn.
<p>
	The Energy Information Administration's latest energy outlook projects total U.S. net oil imports in 1997 to exceed 1977's record high, the pinnacle of the nation's energy crisis, and a continued decline in U.S. domestic crude oil production.  "These projections provide further evidence that the U.S. must alter its current energy policy.  We need to promote domestic energy sources in an effort to increase our nation's energy independence, or face another energy crisis," said Vaughn.<br>
