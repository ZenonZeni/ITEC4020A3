     This directory is a repository of primary and secondary source
     documents on the executive branch's wiretap chips.  If you have a copy
     of something I don't, please send it along. <P>

     A primary source is the words of people and organizations themselves:
     press releases, answers to questions, testimony.  Secondary sources
     are people talking about primary sources; most of it here is
     journalism, but historical writings are always secondary sources as
     well.  Secondary sources are ofter easier to read at the cost of
     distortion and bias.  Primary sources are where the action is, it's
     where the facts are. <P>

     Both are included.  You may want to start with some of the secondary
     documents for orientation and then move on the primary ones for
     detail. <P>
