<h2>THE FRIENDS OF THE POLAR INSTITUTE</h2>

<h4>Who are the Friends?</h4>

An association for those who are interested in the Scott Polar Research Institute and who 
wish to help its work.<p>

This association was established in March 1946 with two objectives: first, to provide a 
means whereby those interested in the promotion of polar exploration and research might 
assist the Scott Polar Research Institute, itself founded in 1920; second, to keep members 
in touch both with the Institute and with present polar activities.<p>

<h4>What do the Friends do?</h4>

The objectives of the Friends are to assist in the development of the Scott Polar Research 
Institute as:<p>

<ul> 
<li>a centre for the stimulation of interest in the Polar Regions; in their peoples and 
environments, and in the relationship of those environments to the world as a whole;<p>

<li>a centre of excellence in polar scholarship and research;<p>

<li>an international information centre dedicated to the collection, organisation, and 
dissemination of knowledge about the Arctic and Antarctic;<p>

<li>a centre for the collection, maintenance and display of materials relating to the history 
of the polar regions.<p>
</ul>

The Friends have provided valuable funding to help various aspects of the Institute’s work.  
Subscriptions are mainly used to help with the acquisition and preservation of material for 
the Institute’s archives.  They also provide help for the Library and Museum in other ways, 
particularly the cases of special need that cannot be met from other sources.  You are 
encouraged to join the Friends and help support this pre-eminent research institute.<p>

<h4>How do I join?</h4>
