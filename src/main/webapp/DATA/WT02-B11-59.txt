<hr><b>There are two courses at vocational upper secondary level: one leading to the higher commercial examination (the “HHX”) and the other leading to the higher technical examination (the “HTX”). A few colleges offer both courses, but normally they are offered at business colleges and technical colleges, respectively. Both are of three years’ duration. Both examinations qualify for admission to higher education, and they also qualify for occupational employment. Suited pupils, who have completed the 9th form of the Folkeskole, have access to both courses.<hr><br></b>
<br>
<b>The Higher Commercial Examination Course<br></b>
The course commenced in 1888 on a private initiative at Niels Brock Business College. Like today, the subject range comprised both commercial and general subjects.<br>
At the beginning of the 1970s, the course had spread to half of the business colleges, and from 1982 it was offered at all business colleges.<br>

Within the past 20 years, the number of students has almost quintupled.<br>

There used to be restricted admission to the course, but today alle qualified applicants are admitted.<br>
<br>
<b>Structure<br></b>
Around 2/3 of the teaching time is spent on obligatory subjects and 1/3 on optional subjects. By means of the optional subjects, the student has a chance to give the course a profile which suits his or her personal interests and future plans. The student may for instance strengthen the language side of the course by choosing an extra foreign language. And through the subjects chosen at high level, special emphasis can be laid on the economic side or the language side of the course or on a combination of the two.<br>

All subjects are placed in a joint upper secondary system of levels with the levels A, B and C, where A is the highest level.<br>

Most of the obligatory subjects comprise at least 2 years’ teaching in the subject. The optional subjects which may both be extensions to the obligatory subjects or totally new subjects, are on the contrary of one year’s duration. One two-year optional subject must however be chosen: either mathematics or an additional foreign language.<br>

In the first year, about half of the subjects are common with the subjects in the vocational education and training courses in the area of commerce, clerical trades and public administration. This applies to subject-areas within information technology, commerce and social sciences. The other obligatory subjects are Danish, business economics, English and a second foreign language (German, French or Spanish). To this should be added an optional subject.<br>

After the first year, the student may change to a vocational education and training course in the area of commerce, clerical trades and public administration.<br>
In the second year, the instruction continues in Danish, business economics, English, the second foreign language and the optional subject. To this should be added instruction in sales, information technology and contemporary history.<br>

In the third year, the instruction continues in Danish and contemporary history, and to this should be added international economics and commercial law. The student must furthermore choose 3 or 4 optional subjects, of which at least 2 must be at level A. The optional subjects may be extensions to the obligatory subjects, e.g. business economics (A), English (A) and sales (A). Or they may be entirely new subjects, such as environmental studies, history of ideas, media knowledge and psychology.<br>
<br>
<b>Major Written Assignment<br></b>
In the last year of the course, all students must in the course of a week elaborate a major written assignment. The students do not receive instruction during this week.<br>

It is the students themselves who choose the subject in which the assignment is to be written, and in co-operation with the subject-teacher they decide on the area to be dealt with in the assignment. The concrete formulation of the asignment is made by the teacher. The assignment is corrected and assessed by the teacher and one external examiner.<br>
<br>
<b>The 1-Year Higher Commercial Examination Course<br></b>
For students who have already acquired one general upper secondary qualification, there is a specially organised higher commercial examination course of one year’s duration. The obligatory subjects in this course are: business economics (B), sales (B), information technology (B), international economics (B) and commercial law (C). In addition to this, the student must choose two optional subjects. The examination in the subjects mentioned is common with that of the 3-year course.<br>
<br>
<b>The Higher Technical Examination Course<br></b>
The higher technical examination course (the “HTX”) was introduced in 1982. It is primarily directed at young people who are interested in science and technology. The course comprises both technical subjects and general subjects.<br>
The course is offered at the technical colleges. Although it is a fairly new course, it is offered at most (i.e. 40) technical colleges.<br>
<br>
<b>Structure<br></b>
Around 2/3 of the teaching time is spent on obligatory subjects and 1/3 on optional subjects. The optional subjects are either extensions of existing subjects, choice of technical area or entirely new subjects.<br>

All subjects are placed in a joint upper secondary system of levels with the levels A, B and C, where A is the highest level. The course comprises a minimum of three subjects at level A.<br>

The introductory part of the course is of 6 months’ duration and comprises the subjects: vocational subjects, science (physics, chemistry, biology), mathematics, Danish, English and German/French. The individual colleges may offer different vocational subjects with different vocational content. The vocational subjects will have the same aim as a corresponding subject in a technical vocational education and training course. After the introductory part, the student can change to a technical vocational education and training course.<br>

The following 1 1/2 years comprise the subjects: technology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, Danish, English, German/French, social studies and optional subjects. Danish is studied for the obligatory A-level, whereas the student is free to choose the level in the other subjects. A number of subjects at low or intermediate level C or B are completed as obligatory subjects after the 2nd year of the course.<br>

In the last year, Danish is obligatory, and the student must choose one of the technical subjects. In addition, at least one subject must be chosen at the highest level. At the end of the course, the student must carry out a major technical project complete with a report.<br>

The other optional subjects among other things include design, history of technology, quality control and business economics.<br>
<br>
<b>Management<br></b>
Each college has a principal, who is accountable to the board of governors of the college and to the Ministry of Education. Otherwise, colleges are run on a non-hierarchical basis with only a few assistants to the principal and no other middle management.<br>

Teachers’ councils are statutory, and teachers as well as students take active part in the decision-making at most levels.<br>
<br>
<b>Board of Governors<br></b>
Each business and technical college has a board of governors which is responsible for the running of the college.<br>

The board consists of representatives of the local business sector (both employers and employees),  the county council and the municipal councils. The teachers, the administrative staff of the college and the students are also represented on the board - but in a non-voting capacity.<br>

The board appoints and dismisses the principal and - on the recommendation of the principal - approves the appointment and dismissal of the other staff of the college.<br>
<br>
<b>Student Participation<br></b>
Students’ councils are statutory, and decisions regarding the form and content of the teaching are taken jointly by teachers and students.<br>
<br>
<b>Cost of Teaching and Tuition<br></b>
The teaching costs are covered by the State, and tuition is free for the students.<br>
<br>
<b>The School Year<br></b>
The duration of the school year is 35-36 weeks, excluding the examination period.<br>
<br>
<b>National Supervision of Examinations<br></b>
All material presented for the examination must be approved by the Ministry of Education. The ministry draws up the written examination papers and appoints the external examiners for the oral and written examinations. Each year, the ministry decides on the subjects which the students are to be examined in.<br>
<br>
<b>Examinations<br></b>
In order to pass the HHX or the HTX, the student must have a combination of common core and optional subjects corresponding to the total number of lessons. At least two of them must be taken at level A. The rest may be taken either at basic level or at intermediate level.<br>
<br>
The student must pass an examination in all subjects studied. This examination can either be in the form of a written, an oral, or a project examination, or it can be combination of the three.<br>
<br>
<b>Examination Average<br></b>
Marks are awarded on a scale from 0 to 13. The final result includes the marks obtained in the examination as well as the marks awarded by the teacher on completion of the course. In order to pass, the student must obtain a minimum average of 6.0 both in the year’s work and at the examination.<br>
<br>
The student’s work is subject to continuous assessment, and term marks are given twice a year.<br>

The student’s examination average is important for his or her future possibilities in the education system, as admission is restricted at most higher education institutions.<br>
<br>
<b>Student Counselling<br></b>
All upper secondary institutions have a number of counsellors. They are appointed locally from among the teachers of the institution and have received special training to function as counsellors. About 1/3 of their working time is devoted to counselling: career guidance as well as general pastoral advice.<br>
<br>
<b>Grants and Loans<br></b>
Students are eligible for financial assistance in the form of a State education grant and/or loan. The kind and extent of the assistance are based on the applicant’s age and his or her own or - in some cases the parents’ - financial circumstances. In order to obtain a grant and/or loan, the applicant must be a Danish citizen. Under certain circumstances, however, students from other countries may receive assistance according to the rules applying to Danish citizens.<br>
