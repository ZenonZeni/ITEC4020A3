SLOWDOWN TEMPORARY FOR WINDOWS 95; MEETS EXPECTATIONS

Although most analysts have downgraded their estimates
about the number of copies of Windows 95 that would sell
during 1996, the numbers are expected to pick up a bit
during the coming year.

Dataquest (San Jose, Calif.), for example, reduced its
Windows 95 forecast by 3.6 million, from 30 million to
26.4 million.  Dataquest now estimates that 16.4 million
copies of Windows 95 will be in consumers' hands by the
end of 1995 (the rest staying in the distribution
channel).

The lower forecast "is an artifact of forecasting a
product at a time when it was not yet in the market and
when the final shipment date had not been set," said
Dataquest principal analyst Paul Cubbage.

Estimates were downgraded for a variety of reasons.  One
is that many corporations have been particularly cautious
about upgrading from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95.
Companies are taking their time to make the decision
because moving to Windows 95 is expensive, both in terms
of money and the time it takes to learn the new operating
system, said Chris Le Tocq, president of Softracks
Software Research (Los Altos, Calif.).

"There have been two years of people trying to get
Windows 3.1 to work, and it works pretty well.  A lot of
organizations are now smart enough not to upgrade just
for upgrade's sake," he said.  Although companies view
Windows 95 as more reliable than Windows 3.1, they have
to evaluate whether it is worth the pain they anticipate
installation will cost them, he said.

When corporations buy a PC today, they have the option
of ordering it with Windows 95, Windows 3.1, or both, Le
Tocq explained.  Many are opting for both, and to date,
they are turning to Windows 3.1 because it is a known
quantity, he said.

Consumers also are not buying Windows 95 in the
quantities originally forecasted.  Cubbage attributed
this to the fact that consumers don't have as much to
spend and are not as optimistic about the economy as
anticipated.

The slowdown in sales of Windows 95 is temporary, Cubbage
said, because eventually, users will have no choice but
to use the operating system.  Cubbage predicted that
sales will pick up by the second or third quarter of
1996.

It is irrelevant whether Windows 95 penetration is up to
its aggressive predictions, because virtually every new
version of key application software products is being
written for Windows 95, and users aren't going to stop
advancing their software.  Eventually these applications
alone are going to move users to Windows 95, said Tom
Nolle, president of CIMI Corp. (Voorhees, N.J.).

MEETING EXPECTATIONS

All in all, Windows 95 has met expectations.

"I think it is pretty much on target," Cubbage said.  "It
is an improvement and doesn't break nearly as much as
Windows 3.1.  At least for me, it runs at about the same
speed as Windows 3.1."

Windows 95's ability to work with different types of
hardware and to control the hardware is better than
Windows 3.1's, but not nearly as foolproof as Microsoft
has claimed, Le Tocq said.  Despite the fact that it does
an outstanding job of detecting hardware and working with
it, there are key hardware platforms that it doesn't
detect, he said.

There is always a laundry list of things to fix when a
new piece of software enters the marketplace, and Windows
95 is no exception.  "When you have something new, you
discover maybe there are things you didn't spend as much
time on as you would have wished," explained Le Tocq.
"Maybe you provided for 300 network cards, and it turns
out the remaining 50 are really important to people.
That's pretty common."

There is widespread belief that Microsoft is preparing
a fix of Windows 95, which probably will hit the
marketplace in the second quarter of 1996.

But it wouldn't be prudent for Microsoft to spill the
beans about a fix during the lucrative holiday buying
season, Nolle said, because the effect would be to cut
Microsoft's current sales of Windows 95.

Le Tocq agreed.  "[The fix] probably will arrive with
very little fanfare so it won't disturb current sales.
When you have such high public exposure, you don't want
to announce a fix.  I wouldn't be surprised to see them
slip the fix into the boxes and keep shipping it, and
then tell people once there is enough of it in the
channel."

STATISTICS ABOUT WINDOWS 95

93% of those who have already purchased Windows 95 are
satisfied with it.
91% agree that Windows 95 was worth the expense.
90% said it was worth the time and effort it took to
install it.

88% said they would buy Windows 95 again.
86% said they would recommend Windows 95 to a friend or
colleague.

47% indicated they bought Windows 95 exclusively for home
use.
16% indicated they bought Windows 95 exclusively for work
use.
37% indicated they bought Windows 95 for both home and
work use.

26% said their main reason for buying it was to improve
previous platform/performance.
25% said it was to keep up with technology.
23% cited wanting the applications supported by Windows
95 as the reason for buying it.
13% said they bought Windows 95 because it was bundled
with the hardware.

FOR MICROSOFT IN 1996, UBIQUITY IS KEY

If Microsoft is to continue its domination of most major
computer technology sectors in 1996 and beyond, it must
shore up areas in which it has been traditionally weak
and continue along its path in areas in which it
dominates.

In 1996, Microsoft must enter any pockets of the
technology market that it hasn't already conquered, said
Tom Nolle, president of CIMI Corp. (Voorhees, N.J.).
"Any place the market might go that Microsoft isn't
already in is a potential risk for them.  To some degree,
Microsoft has to be everywhere," he said.  "A little leak
is all it takes.  Its position in the marketplace will
be easier to defend if there is no area of major weakness
because if there is, that may be enough for any company
to break Microsoft's hold on the market."

Microsoft should stick to what it knows best: commodity
desktop software, said Brian Jeffery, an analyst with
International Technology Group (Mountain View, Calif.).
"Microsoft seems to be doing fairly well on the desktop,
but anything above the desktop isn't flying very well.
For a few years, Microsoft suffered from the illusion
that it was something else, but it should stick with what
it knows best," he said.

For example, Microsoft's foray into the world of the
Internet may be misguided, Jeffery said.  Microsoft can
be divided into two businesses: the very stable and
profitable desktop software business, and a collection
of niche businesses, which, for Microsoft, is "science
fiction," he said.

"There is a lot of talk about Microsoft dominating the
Internet, but that is absolute rubbish," Jeffery said.
"It will never be a large percentage of their revenue.
They should stick to their core successes."

Although Internet-related business presents a lot of
possibilities for Microsoft in 1996, "there is just as
much of a possibility that it will cost a lot of money
as there is that Microsoft will make a lot of money,"
said William Zachmann, president of Canopus Research
(Duxbury, Mass.).

But Microsoft has the financial resources to try
different things in an effort to come up with the next
big thing, Zachmann said.  "But they are fishing.  If
you look at Microsoft Network, it was supposed to be a
big deal, and it is off to a limping start."

To maintain its edge in 1996, Microsoft must focus on
expanding its positions of traditional strengths into the
network and collaborative applications arena, which have
been areas of relative weakness for Microsoft, Nolle
said.

 "There are many things operating systems services can
logically be expected to do, and one is to provide the
basic tools for multisystem collaboration and to set a
developmental standard that would be used to build
applications like ATM to the desktop or videoconferencing
applications," he said.  In this area, Nolle explained,
Microsoft hasn't established a lock on the developer
community like it has in other areas.

ABOVE THE LAW?

Analysts generally agree that Microsoft's legal troubles
are pretty much behind them, at least in 1996.  Microsoft
is "walking a pretty well-defined path through the
minefield, and unless they do something cocky and stupid,
I think they are fairly safe," Nolle said.

The Justice Department has not been unduly harsh with
Microsoft, but there may still be some rumblings in the
halls of Justice.  "I would tend to view any substantial
intervention by the Justice Department as a wild card
rather than something I would confidently anticipate,"
Zachmann said.

But despite the fact that Microsoft's path to success
legally is fairly well-defined, it isn't impossible that
company officials may get myopic, so immersed in its
culture that they lose sight of how the company is
perceived.  That could spell trouble for Microsoft by
1997, Nolle predicted.

"Microsoft needs to think about the things that IBM and
AT&T have faced: the question of a preemptive strike to
reduce the legal pressure," Nolle said.  "AT&T and IBM
both came to the conclusion that they were better off
accepting a self-imposed change that diffused the legal
activity."

1997 AND BEYOND

By the end of 1996, Microsoft will be more firmly
established in the applications area than ever because
of IBM's acquisition of Lotus and Novell's divestiture
of WordPerfect.  Those actions have basically demolished
competition for Microsoft in those key application areas,
Nolle said.  "Microsoft is going to run rampant in
applications in 1996," he predicted.

But Microsoft could experience a setback in market
leadership, industry dominance and market command either
this year or next, Zachmann warned.  "I've been
anticipating a setback for Microsoft for some time now,
but it hasn't happened yet.  One of these quarters,
Microsoft's earnings are going to fall, and that could
precipitate the setback.  To continue on its growth
track, Microsoft has to keep coming up with lots of
earnings gains, and that gets tougher and tougher to do."

MSNBC BRINGS MICROSOFT ONE STEP CLOSER
TO TECHNOLOGY DOMINATION

Last month, Microsoft and NBC struck a deal to create a
news service that will inform viewers across broadcast,
cable and the Internet.  The revolutionary news service,
dubbed MSNBC, is designed to take advantage of NBC's
newsgathering expertise and Microsoft's strength in
computer technology, both through its software and its
fledgling on-line service, Microsoft Network.

As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said when the deal was
announced, people want to be able to call up news on
demand at their convenience.  While watching breaking
news on television, consumers want to be able to get
access to more in-depth information on items of interest.
The deal with NBC will help create innovative interactive
news content and an integrated media experience, he
explained.

The deal calls for Microsoft to invest $220 million over
five years for a 50 percent stake in the all-news cable
station.  Both Microsoft and NBC will invest $200 million
over five years to fund the cable channel and a
supporting on-line service.

Areas of special interest for Microsoft include
interactive television and on-line computer services,
both of which will be incorporated into the MSNBC
venture.

Gates apparently wanted to enter the news business very
badly: when a deal to acquire a large stake in Turner
Broadcasting Service went awry last August, Microsoft got
back in the saddle and spent the next several months
contemplating and executing a plan to get what it wanted.
With the MSNBC deal, it may have done just that.

A BETTER PLAN

The MSNBC venture is a much better way to go than
Microsoft's previous idea, which was to form its own news
organization, said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with
Arlen Communications Inc. (Bethesda, Md.).  Microsoft had
hired more than 20 reporters, who would form the genesis
of what might have been Microsoft's unique news
organization.

But the current plan allows Microsoft to have a buffer.
"Not only does Microsoft get to provide state-of-the-art
news, but it also doesn't get taken to task as a news
agency, which might have been very difficult from a
corporate point of view," Krasilovsky said.

The MSNBC venture will have to prove that there is a
market for people who want to customize this type of
information, said Peter Bernstein, president of
InfoNautics Consulting Inc. (Ramsey, N.J.).  "I think
there is a small segment of the population that would be
interested in doing that, but the question is whether
they will be willing to pay a stiff price for it," he
said.  "Will the perceived value be there for the service
to get the kind of penetration it will need to be
successful?"

At this point, it is difficult to envision that people
who are accustomed to getting information one way will
change their behavior so radically as to heavily use the
service MSNBC plans to provide, Bernstein said.  "But
Microsoft and NBC have plenty of money, and if they want
to back it to the extent that it will probably need to
be backed to change people's behavior, they can do it.
It's a question of marketing, and Microsoft has proven
itself very good at marketing."

By entering into this deal, Microsoft is covering all
bases, trying to position itself as a premier content
provider.  This agreement, along with Microsoft Network
and Microsoft's strong interest in interactive
television, is Microsoft's move into the real-time
content business.  "They honestly believe that content
is going to be king in the future," and Microsoft wants
to own a large part of that empire, Bernstein said.

Content is key, agreed Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS
Strategic Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  Microsoft has made
many alliances for content, including the defunct deal
with Turner Broadcasting and its relationship with SKG
Dreamworks.

A STEPPING STONE TO INTERACTIVE TV?

Some say that providing on-demand news is an interim step
toward gaining a foothold in the interactive television
market.  Microsoft is hoping that MSNBC will be the
interactive TV vehicle for news information, some
believe.

"You can't go wrong with content because all of it is
fairly leveragable," Penhune explained.  "A year ago, or
even now, there is a lot of talk about [deals like this]
giving Microsoft content for interactive TV.  But even
if it doesn't, it gives them content for all these other
media as well, so it isn't like they are going to be
stuck with something they can't use."

Although projects like the MSNBC venture take plenty of
Microsoft's energy and money, they will not distract
Microsoft from its core projects, Penhune said.  Those
core projects are all targeted at the consumer market,
"and if you accept the premise that they are consumer-
and not business-oriented, then doing something like this
is not a distraction.  It is another way of addressing
the consumer market," he said.

NOTES 4 BEATS MICROSOFT EXCHANGE TO MARKET

Lotus Development Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.) hailed in
Notes Release 4 along with the new year.  Many industry
observers said Lotus' timing is well-aimed to beat out
its primary competition: Microsoft Exchange, scheduled
for general availability in February.  Other analysts
pointed out that Lotus' more more mature product, Notes
Release 4, already has a running start against Microsoft
Exchange Version 1 Release 1.

Notes 4 promises greater functionality and ease of use
over Notes 3.  Calling it the convergence of messaging
and groupware, Lotus outlined the benefits of its fourth-
generation product:

* Object store: Documents and objects can be stored,
managed, and retrieved through links or direct user
manipulation.  The object store does not distinguish
between messages and other objects.

* Security: Additional security beyond password security
and digital signatures is rolled into Notes 4.  Further
security is required to manage access to the object
store, as well as to the individual objects and fields
within that database.

* Mobile support: Notes 4 users will have access to
messages, as well as to objects that have been linked to
those messages.  Notes 4 supports database replication
directly to individual client laptops and remote
desktops.

* Manageability: Manageability requirements are expanded
to include replication.  The client/server architecture
of the integrated messaging and groupware requires that
fourth generation systems provide robust tools for the
centralized management of servers, messages, and object
stores, as well as routers and server tasks.

* Directories: Notes 4 extends the directory to encompass
configuration, authentication/security, and customized
site-specific information.

* Transport and routing: These services are expanded to
transport and route loosely structured documents that
typify fourth generation objects.  Also, Notes 4 has
native support for X.400 and SMTP-MIME transports to
ensure interoperability with international inter-
enterprise communication standards.  Message and document
routing are dynamic, with routing paths that are
alterable on the basis of message urgency to link
availability.

* Migration facilities: Notes 4 migration facilities
allow system administrators and users to migrate at their
own pace and support coexistence among multiple
generations of messaging systems.

ABOUT FACE FOR INTERFACE

Across the board, analysts were most impressed with Notes
4's new and improved interface.  Lotus completely
redesigned its interface, explained Mark Levitt, senior
analyst for electronic messaging for International Data
Corp. (Framingham, Mass.).  "It connects cc:Mail to Notes
through a shared interface," he said.  "As a mail-based
interface, it makes it much easier for cc:Mail users to
use Notes."

The interface is the most important aspect of Notes 4,
Levitt said.  "Notes has always had a great deal of
functionality that has gone unrecognized or unused by
most users," he said.  "Not all users need that amount
of functionality, but the interface makes it simpler and
easier for cc:Mail users to move to Notes.

"Notes 4 goes several steps beyond what cc:Mail is
today," Levitt continued.  "That is not to say that Lotus
is planning to get rid of cc:Mail, but they're making the
migration path to Notes easier."

Vince Carahaly, president of NetExperts Inc. (Exton,
Penn.) and beta customer of Notes 4 on Windows NT for a
month and a half, agreed that the interface was a key
improvement in Notes 4.

"The biggest complaint about Notes 3 was that the e-mail
interface wasn't very good -- even though this was the
company with the award-winning cc:Mail product," Carahaly
said.  "With Notes 4, Lotus gave the e-mail interface the
look and feel of cc:Mail."

Apart from the new interface, Notes 4 improved its
database replication.  Notes 4 supports field-level
replication, while Notes 3 only supported document-level
or record-level replication, Carahaly explained.

For example, a Notes user can have a personnel file with
all the information on an employee and perhaps a bitmap
with a photo ID of the person.  With record-level
replication, if one part of that file changes -- for
instance, the employee's phone number -- the Notes user
must replicate the whole thing.  At field level, the user
can get in and change the phone number.  "It's much more
granular," he said.  "It's more efficient, faster, and
there's less data to ship over."

RELEASE 4 VERSUS RELEASE 1

Even without the one month head start over Microsoft,
Lotus is still in a better position with Notes 4 than
Microsoft is with Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.
"Notes is an established product.  It's a mature
generation of product -- that's their head start right
off the bat," he said.

In addition, Notes 4 is a more robust environment than
Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.  "Microsoft Exchange
is not workflow -- it's just client/server mail," he
said.  "Notes is a workflow product with client/server
mail."

"Shops that have Notes probably won't switch to Microsoft
Exchange," Carahaly said.  "Many companies are waiting
to see how good Notes 4 actually is.  Once it gets into
the market and people find that it has no problems, does
what it says it does, the improvements are there and
functioning -- it will be a hit."

Another analyst agreed that Notes 4 is a large
improvement over Notes 3.  "Notes 4 is a great leap
forward," said Tom Austin, research director with the
Gartner Group (Stamford, Conn.).  "Notes 4 put in place
a real integrated development environment."

Austin also praised the new mail interface.  "Notes 4 has
brought management of communications to the point where
mere mortals can do it," he said.  In addition, Notes 4
has improvements in scalability.  "With Notes 4, a server
can support five to ten times more people versus Notes
3," he said.  "This greatly reduces the cost of
management."

JAVA JOCKEYING

Notes 4 contains the programming language Lotus Script.
"Lotus Script obsoletes Notes macros," Austin said.
Despite the recent announcements that both IBM and
Microsoft will support Java and Java Script, Austin said
neither company will abandon their own script languages.
"Java Script won't rule the world," he said.  "But both
IBM and Lotus will support Java."

Although Austin said he was very impressed with Notes 4,
he said the release should have been on the market one
and a half years ago.  "Lotus does not have a track
record for accelerated development," he said.  "Notes 4
came three years after Notes 3.  If it takes Lotus three
more years to come out with Notes 5, it will be looking
at the pack from the back."

MICROSOFT BACKS IEEE MULTIMEDIA CONNECTION/CONTROL
STANDARD

Microsoft last week threw its support behind the IEEE
1394 serial bus interface standard, indicating that it
would be adhered to in future releases of the company's
various Windows operating systems.

The standard enables high-performance multimedia
connections and control of business and consumer
electronic devices.  It offers high-speed communications
and fully supports isochronous real-time data services.
It also supports Plug and Play, allowing "hot plugging"
of up to 63 external peripherals for convenient system
reconfiguration by the user.  It allows peer-to-peer
device communication, such as communication between a
scanner and a printer, to take place without consuming
system memory and CPU resources.

For multimedia applications, the IEEE interface enables
real-time digital data transfer for audio and video
capture, editing and playback, as well as for distributed
multimedia applications such as desktop conferencing.
For example, users can easily transfer images from a
camcorder to a PC.  These images can be edited and
replayed on the PC or TV screen while users
simultaneously print color pictures.  For traditional
data storage, IEEE 1394 is faster and less expensive than
comparable SCSI interfaces, supporting data transfer
rates of 400 megabits per second and increasing in speed
in the future.

Microsoft also revealed that it has signed a letter of
intent with Sony Electronics Inc. to develop open device
driver interfaces (DDIs), APIs and an open host
controller interface for IEEE 1394.

Another letter of intent with Compaq Computer Corp. is
targeted at accelerating adoption of the IEEE 1394
high-speed serial interface as a standard in the PC
industry.  This includes defining an open host controller
interface specification.  Both efforts will be undertaken
in cooperation with the 1394 Trade Association.

"The IEEE 1394 interface is an enabling technology for
expanding PC connectivity to a greater range of devices
and to new classes of peripherals, such as consumer
entertainment appliances," said Brad Silverberg, senior
vice president of the personal systems division at
Microsoft, in a prepared statement.  "IEEE 1394 enables
PCs to play a central role in consumer entertainment
systems.  We are pleased to be working with the leading
companies in the consumer electronics industry to develop
the IEEE 1394 serial bus interface standard."

Microsoft, a member of the 1394 Trade Association, is
playing a leading role in developing and promoting an
open IEEE 1394 serial bus interface specification.
Microsoft hosted the IEEE 1394 meeting in July and will
be hosting a 1394 driver architecture design preview in
March 1996.

SUPPORT FOR IEEE 1394

Various hardware manufacturers have pledged support for
the 1394 specification, including Cirrus Logic, Conner
Peripherals, Digital Equipment Corp., Western Digital,
Texas Instruments and Adaptec.

Adaptec Inc., a provider of input/output solutions, plans
to supply high-speed 1394 solutions that will allow PC
applications to "speak" to home electronics devices such
as camcorders and set-top boxes and make applications
such as desktop video editing a reality.  Among the
markets and applications for 1394, according to Adaptec,
are digital video, home electronics, near-term computer
applications such as desktop video editing, and
convergence of PCs and home electronics.

IDC: MICROSOFT WILL DO WELL IN '96 --
BUT DARK CLOUDS HOVER OVER THE HORIZON

DISAPPOINTMENT, RETRENCHMENT FORECAST FOR '96 ELECTRONIC
Marketplace: Microsoft will have a great year in 1996,
but its hold will be challenged by the Internet-based
"Revenge of the (Unix) Nerds," according to market
researcher IDC.

In the overall electronic marketplace, 1996 will be a
year of disappointment as investors and corporations
suffer through the discouragingly slow development of a
significant consumer base, IDC predicts.

MICROSOFT'S LOOSENED GRIP

One effect of the Internet phenomenon of 1995, IDC said,
has been that many on Wall Street and within the IT
industry now are forecasting the undoing of Microsoft's
hold on the industry, and hailing the rise of Netscape
and Sun Microsystems as the new industry leaders.

"While IDC recognizes the potential of the Internet world
to weaken several of Microsoft's key levers on the
industry, such as OLE and Visual Basic, there will be
relatively little revenue effect from this in 1996," IDC
researcher Frank Gens said.  "We also believe in spite
of the recurring rumors of Department of Justice
investigations, Microsoft will escape any major antitrust
activity in 1996, an election year.  Additionally,
Microsoft will conclude that its ventures into new
businesses will have a greater chance of success without
the Microsoft brand."

GLOOM AND DOOM

By this time next year, IDC predicts 20 percent of the
Fortune 500 companies that have commercial Web sites will
close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost sites.


The leading online information service providers (e.g.,
Compuserve, America Online, Microsoft Network, Prodigy)
will derive more than one-half of their revenue from
providing access to the Web by mid-1997.  IDC predicts
that two of the four will struggle to survive.

"In 1996 we predict that the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's `intoxication' stage
to a `hangover' stage," said Frank Gens, senior vice
president of research at IDC, the world's leading
provider of information technology (IT) data, analysis
and counseling.  "The high-flying Internet suppliers will
have disappointing financial results, while technical
capabilities of the Internet are stretched to the
breaking point.

"Though we predict the overall growth in online
subscribers will continue to be very strong, we expect
1996 will show a high turnover rate as users underwhelmed
by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscription services and turn on their TVs," Gens said.
"Still, 1996 will be a strategic investment year for
businesses that expect to compete in the growing
electronic marketplace, because during the next five
years, the number of `wired' (i.e., online) users will
rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it will
exceed 1 billion."

Gens also predicts IT industry revenues will jump from
$500 billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and
corporate spending on IT will rise from 2 - 2.5 percent
of revenues to more than 5 percent. In addition, IDC
believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or
more by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

"Some financial service companies, retailers and
publishers will bail out in the initial hangover period,"
Gens said.  "In the process, they will cripple their
businesses' ability to compete in the growing `virtual
economy.' In contrast, leaders in the emerging electronic
marketplace will significantly increase their
investments. In the process, the seeds will be sown for
the creation of new leadership and the downfall of some
current giants in many industries."  Internet Appliances


By this time next year, IDC predicts that manufacturers
of Internet Appliances -- low-cost devices that allow the
user to access online information -- will ultimately
slash prices in half by year's end.

"Internet Appliances will arrive in 1996, but the
successful ones won't be priced at $500," Gens said.
They will come out of the gates at $100 to $300.  The
game console crowd is already slicing away at the pricing
for simple Web surfing devices.  Within two years,
Internet Appliances will emerge as giveaways (less than
$100 to free) by businesses that want customers to access
their online services.

"Price competition in data to the home will become
brutal," Gens said.  IDC predicts that high-performance
Internet access will be delivered to the home for as
little as $15 to 20 per month in 1996, down from $25 to
$70.  Pricing will drop to $10 to 15 per month within the
next two years, partially because cable companies (with
the help of affordable cable modems) will play the
Internet card as their first foray in the
telecommunications business.  Telephone companies will
respond with more aggressive pricing.

HOME PC MARKET

According to IDC, in 1996 and 1997, suppliers will
aggressively explore new home PC designs to drive down
prices of multimedia devices to $800 to $1,000 (and less)
in an effort to penetrate broader segments of the
increasingly important consumer market.  It will be
paramount for PC vendors to become better acquainted with
the mainstream consumer electronics market and mentality,
and learn a whole new meaning of "price-competitive."
Without doubt, the winners in the PC business in the
coming decade will be those that crack the mass-market
barrier.
