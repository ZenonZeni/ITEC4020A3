<H3>Opening Doors: CCD Federal Housing Policy Principles</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>Principles which guide the development of federal housing policy and the use of federal housing funds must provide clear direction and a comprehensive approach for addressing the housing needs of people with disabilities, as well as ensuring enforceable standards to address the housing discrimination which occurs when people with disabilities seek access to housing or attempt to participate in federally mandated housing planning activities.  

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force believes that it is the responsibility of the federal government and HUD to ensure that <B>all</B> federally funded housing activities emphasize both the civil rights and the housing rights of people with disabilities consistent with the provisions of the; (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (2) Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 and, (3) the Americans with Disabilities Act.

<P>In addition, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that the following principles should underpin federal housing policy for people with disabilities. 
<P>
<UL>
<li>Equity in Housing Resources - People with disabilities must receive an equitable share of the federal housing resources available within a framework that considers the extent of their unmet housing needs in relation to the existing inventory of housing resources available to them.  <P>
<LI>Expanding Housing Supply - Increasing the supply of affordable housing for people with disabilities should be achieved primarily within the context of a community's affordable housing activities and facilitated through generic and traditional housing providers including community based non-profit groups, as well as for-profit housing developers/managers. <P>	
<LI><B>Inclusion/Integration </B>- People with disabilities must be able to live in and fully participate in all aspects of community living by having the choice of non-stigmatizing housing opportunities that are integrated within communities and neighborhoods.  <P>	
<LI><B>Non-discrimination </B>- People with disabilities have the right to be free from discrimination in housing both in the rental and home ownership markets and in local zoning and land use policies. <P>
<LI><B>Housing Choice </B>- People with disabilities must have a choice of community housing options which reflect their personal values, needs, and housing preferences. <P>
<LI><B>Affordability </B>- Due to their extremely low incomes, people with disabilities must have access to affordable housing.<P>	
<LI><B>Quality, Safety and Accessibility </B>- All housing acquired or created for people with disabilities must be decent and safe.  Federal housing policy should also ensure an adequate supply of accessible housing.<P>
<LI><B>Access </B>- People with disabilities have the right to access housing on a variety of levels: as individuals, as members of communities, and as constituents of the affordable housing delivery system. <P>
<LI><B>Promote Separation of Housing from Services</B> - Federal housing policy for people with disabilities must promote the separation of housing from support services by emphasizing the desire and ability of people with disabilities to assume the roles and responsibilities of  tenants and/or homeowners. <P>		
<LI><B>Empowerment</B> - As housing consumers and customers, people with disabilities, advocates, and service providers, must be empowered to fully participate in all activities related to federal housing programs and policies, including community-based planning, housing development and rehabilitation, and housing management.<P></ul>
