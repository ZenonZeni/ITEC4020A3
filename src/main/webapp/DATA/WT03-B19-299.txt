<P>
The CRC for International Food Manufacture & Packaging Science was established in July 1995 to extend the market growth and international competitiveness of Australia's food and packaging industry. It brings together major commercial companies and research institutions with expertise in the development of specific food/packaging processes and with technical and manufacturing knowledge.
The research program has a realistic promise of creating commercial output of great strategic value to Australia's economic and environmental future.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
This CRC has developed a balanced program of applied and strategic research with wide-reaching generic outcomes as well as targeted commercial gains. The research is focused on three aspects of the food chain: food manufacturing, novel packaging for life extension, and package recycle/disposal.
Industry-driven trials provide practical testing of developments, specific commercial targets and a tangible mechanism for transferring technology from research to industry.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The research programs have been constructed to solve technical impediments to Australia's exporting of value-added food products, particularly into the Asian market. This market is set to expand by $160 billion by the year 2000 and presents the Australian food industry with an unprecedented opportunity.
The industry partners recognise the limited time available to exploit this opportunity because American and European companies are gearing themselves to penetrate the market.
New trade barriers, based on environmental issues, are also being applied to packaging, which is the crucial element in obtaining the shelf life required for export. Complex science and engineering solutions are required if these opportunities are to be grasped.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Historically, the CRC for International Food Manufacture and Packaging Science concept was driven by the CSIRO Division of Material Science and Technology and Swinburne University of Technology, both based in Melbourne. Other research organisations and industrial partners already had links with these groups through various collaborations. Victoria will become the hub of a truly international p artnership as products developed in Australia are introduced to the Asian market.
The Centre is nurturing a comprehensive education program with both task-oriented and research activities. The provision of well-trained, informed and motivated graduates to the Australian food and packaging industries is a major goal of the centre.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC encourages the participation of a broad range of industry organisations and researchers. The foundation participants were brought together to cover a range of research, development and commercialisation requirements of the food and packaging market.
Opportunities already exist and more will develop over time for further partners to participate in specialist or complementary areas.
The Centre Agreement allows for three methods of participation. "Participants" are able to participate fully in the programs, beneficially own intellectual property and direct the centre's activities through their vote on the Board of Management. "Associate" membership allows for the same level of participation as a full Participant except for Board membership. "Project Agreements" provide a way for organisations to be involved in specific areas of interest.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The centre will receive $14.2 million in cash and $6 million in kind from the industrial participants, $12 million in kind from the research participants and $16.2 million as a CRC grant from the Australian Government.
