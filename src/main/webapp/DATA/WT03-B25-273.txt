THE SPACE SHUTTLE<BR>
First launch of NASA's space shuttle: shown here is COLUMBIA on 27 June
1982.  NASA's space shuttle was in routine use for placing satellites in
orbit, and retrieving and servicing them, prior to the Challenger accident
in January 1986.<BR>
Australia's first domestic communications satellite AUSSAT 1 was launched
by space shuttle in August 1985.<BR>

ARIANE, THE EUROPEAN LAUNCH VEHICLE<BR>
ARIANE is a three-stage expendable rocket for launching communications satellites
financed by ESA (European Space Agency) and developed by CNES (Centre National
d'Etude Spatiales, the French national space agency), with system integration
by the French company, Aerospatiale.<BR>
The production and marketing of ARIANE launchers is now handled by Arianespace,
a commercial organization of 36 European companies, 13 banks, and CNES,
set up in 1980.<BR>
ARIANE-1, shown here, is designed to place satellites of up to 970 kg into
geostationary orbit.  The vehicle was declared operational in January 1982
following three successful test flights out of a program of four.  The final
successful test flight on 20 December 1981 (launch shown here) placed the
European maritime communications satellite (MARECS-A) into orbit.<BR>
ARIANE completed many successful launches up until May 1986, when a rocket
failure put the program on hold.  Launches were recommenced in September
1987, when Aussat 3 was successfully placed into Geostationary Transfer
Orbit following an Ariane launch from Kourou, in French Guiana.<BR>

JAPANESE LAUNCH VEHICLE<BR>
The sixth N-11 vehicle lifting off from its launch pad at NASDA's (National
Space Development Agency of Japan) Osaki Launch Site, Tanegashima Space
Centre on 3 August 1984.  It placed the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-3
(GMS-3), servicing the Asia-Pacific region, into orbit.<BR>
Australia obtains its satellite weather pictures from GMS, which sits in
space about 36 000 km above Papua New Guinea.<BR>

SOME REMOTE SENSING SATELLITES<BR>
LANDSAT-5 is the latest in a series of U.S. Earth Resources Technology Satellites
(ERTS) launched during the 1970s and 1980s by NASA.  The LANDSAT satellites
are now operated by NOAA (U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
as land remote sensing satellites.  LANDSAT satellites are being progressively
'privatize'.  The Administration also operates the NOAA polar-orbiting weather
satellites.<BR>
BAKSHIRA-2 is a remote-sensing satellite launched by the U.S.S.R. in 1981
for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).  The next Indian remote
sensing satellite, called IRS, was built by ISRO and was launched on an
Indian rocket in 1986.<BR>
SPOT is the French national remote sensing satellite, placed in orbit during
1985 by the European launch vehicle ARIANE.  It was built by Matra Espace,
France and is commercially operated by Spot Image.  A significant technological
advance carried by SPOT will be the steerable mirror on its scanner, which
thereby allows it to provide more frequent cover of a particular zone as
stereoscopic images.<BR>
Japan's MOS-1 (Marine Observation Satellite) was launched in early 1987.
 It was built by NEC, a Japanese company, for NASDA (National Space Development
Agency of Japan).<BR>
MOMS (Marine Observation Meteorological Satellite) was launched by West
Germany in ????<BR>
ERS-1 (ERS, Earth Resources Satellite) is the first satellite in the European
Space Agency's remote sensing program, due for launch aboard ARIANE in 1989.
 Its prime function will be surveillance of the oceans and coastal zones,
including ice monitoring.  ERS-1 is being built by the German company, Dornier.
 It will be the first of the new generation of radar-equipped, remote-sensing
satellites, which can 'see' day or night, through clear or cloudy skies.
 As well as radar, ERS-1 will carry the Along Track Scanning Radiometer
(ATSR), the development of which is a collaborative project between the
UK Science and Engineering Council and CSIRO.<BR>
RADARSAT, the Canadian remote sensing satellite, will carry a radar scanner
similar to that of ERS-1.  It is being built by Spar Aerospace and the planned
launch date is 1990.<BR>

<BR>
LANDSAT SATELLITES<BR>
LANDSAT-4, shown here, was launched in 1982.  It is one of the series of
Earth Resources Technology Satellites (ERTS) launched by the US.  Two are
currently operational: LANDSAT-4 and LANDSAT-5.<BR>
Each LANDSAT satellite has a mass of about 1 tonne and orbits the earth
from north to south (polar orbit) at an altitude of about 706 kilometres.
 Complete coverage of the globe is provided by each satellite once every
16 days.<BR>
As the satellite passes overhead, the earth is viewed by the multispectral
scanning (MSS) telescope.  The telescope scans to and fro across a 185 kilometre-wide
strip of the earth below, detecting light of four different wavelengths
in green, red, and two infra-red bands.  The light intensity in each of
these four bands is measured for individual 80 metre-square areas.  There
are 7.5 million of these very small picture elements, or pixels (pixel size
= 80m2) in one standard 185 kilometre-square LANDSAT image.  The Thematic
Mapper (TM) was flown as a new R &amp; D sensor on LANDSAT-4.  It became
operational (on LANDSAT-5) in August 1984.  The pixel size for TM is 30m2.
 In addition, it covers a much greater spectral range than MSS.<BR>
The TDRS antenna allows NASA's TDRS (Tracking Data Relay Satellites) to
obtain data from LANDSAT without the need for ground stations or on board
recording.<BR>
The solar array collects energy to power the satellite.<BR>
S- and X-band antennae transmit data to earth at 2 different frequencies,
S for current MSS and X for new TM.<BR>

THE ACRES DATA ACQUISITION AND DATA PROCESSING FACILITIES<BR>
The Australian Centre for Remote Sensing's Data Acquisition and Data Processing
Facility is located at Alice Springs.  It was commissioned in 1979.  The
antenna receives LANDSAT data for all parts of Australia and the neighbouring
seas.  The recording equipment is in the buildings in the background.  The
data received from the satellite are taken to Canberra for processing.<BR>
The reception facility regularly receives Landsat MSS data, and is being
upgraded to receive and process Landsat TM data, plus data from the French
SPOT satellite.<BR>

AUSTRALIAN USES FOR LANDSAT DATA, 1983-84<BR>
Australians were quick to see the potential value of LANDSAT images to the
management of this continent's vast resources and wide open spaces.  Australian
scientists began investigating the use of LANDSAT photographs soon after
the first LANDSAT was launched in 1972.  They were particularly interested
at that time in exploration for minerals.<BR>
<BR>
Now, fifteen years later and after much original research on image enhancement,
Australians use LANDSAT images for a wide range of purposes, but with geology,
geography, and exploration still at the head of the list, with agricultural
and pastoral purposes increasing.<BR>

COSSA Slides 10 and 11<BR>
<BR>
LANDSAT IMAGES OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF<BR>
Slide 10 is a raw LANDSAT image of Batt Reef and Tongue Reef on the Great
Barrier Reef between Cairns and Cooktown.  The reef appears as pale-blue
beneath the sea surface.<BR>
The raw data from LANDSAT can be enhanced in various ways.  Slide 11 is
a 'classified' image of the same view as Slide 10.  Classification involves
the use of a computer algorithm which analyses each pixel (picture element)
and groups into classes or sets of pixels having similar spectral values.
 Each of these classes can then be given a label (interpreted in reef cover
terms) by a reef scientist or manager.  Groups of pixels having the same
label can then be aggregated and an image plotted with each class having
a distinct colour.<BR>

COSSA Slides 12 and 13<BR>
<BR>
HYDROGRAPHERS PASSAGE: LANDSAT SHOWS SAFE SHIPPING WAY<BR>
A deep-water channel known as Hydrographers Passage , through the Great
Barrier Reef, is shown running top left to bottom right in this LANDSAT
picture (Slide 12).  Its discovery in 1982 by HMAS 'Flinders' was made possible
by careful studies of aerial and satellite pictures, as well as detailed
survey work by 'Flinders'.  Coal ships travelling from Hay Point to Japan
are now using the passage and saving 1600 kilometres per trip and millions
of dollars per year.<BR>
The LANDSAT scanner is sensitive to various spectral regions or colours,
and this permits detection of light from various depths below the sea surface.
 In the image of Hydrographers Passage given in Slide 13, yellow has been
assigned to the band that penetrates right down to 15 metres.  Red is the
intermediate band that shows areas from 50 centimetres to 5 metres deep.
 Very shallow areas, less than 50 centimetres deep, are shown as green.<BR>

<BR>
LANDSAT DETECTS LAND CLEARING AND OTHER LAND USE CHANGES<BR>
The benefits of using LANDSAT techniques to observe progressive changes
in vegetation have been shown in a study of Kangaroo Island by the Remote
Sensing Branch of the South Australian Department of Environment and Planning.<BR>
This slide shows LANDSAT images of the same area of the island on two different
dates in 1983.  The dark areas are forest and scrubland, and pale areas
are fallow paddocks, red areas are crops and green pasture.  Seasonal changes
in land use are obvious, but so too is the fact that some considerable land
clearance has taken place even over the short period involved.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
COSSA Slides 15 and 16<BR>
<BR>
MAPPING FLOODS WITH LANDSAT<BR>
LANDSAT images can be used to map floods and so suggest where levee banks
should be placed and where valuable structures or equipment should not.
 They have been used in this way by oil and gas explorers in the Cooper
Basin of South Australia, which is prone to sudden and catastrophic floods,
and to map the flood of the Darling River in 1974.<BR>
These two slides show first the normal flow of the Fitzroy River, Western
Australia, and second the river in massive flood in March 1983.  LANDSAT
pictures together with information from the NOAA satellite and aerial photographs,
were used to trace the movement of the floodwaters.  This knowledge of how
the flood developed was used to determine where best to locate levee banks
and other flood mitigation measures.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slides 17 and 18<BR>
<BR>
LANDSAT AND BAUXITE EXPLORATION<BR>
A study was made by the CSIRO Division of Exploration Geoscience of the
potential value of LANDSAT imagery for bauxite exploration and development
in the Weipa, Cape Weymouth district in far north Queensland.<BR>
Slide 17 shows the image given by the raw data from three of the satellite's
spectral scanning bands.  The picture is fairly homogeneous and of little
apparent value to mineral explorers.  The large white area centre left is
the Weipa Mine site.  The black to green-brown areas to the east and south-east
are grass fire burns.<BR>
In Slide 18 the previous image has been enhanced by various means to reveal
a great deal more spectral viability than is shown by the raw data.  If
this variability can be related to bauxite geochemistry, the potential of
LANDSAT imagery to bauxite exploration would also be considerably enhanced.<BR>

LANDSAT KEEPS TABS ON AGRICULTURE<BR>
In this LANDSAT image of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA), the areas
under rice appear as the larger red rectangles.  They are interspersed with
whitish rectangles representing mature winter cereal crops.  The darker,
more continuous red areas are fruit trees and other horticultural crops.<BR>
Images such as this can be used to estimate the area under rice so as to
ensure accurate forecasts of transport and storage needs.  They can also
give an idea of how the amount of irrigation required for the crop might
affect the water table.  It is important to keep a watch on the amount of
water used in this regard, so as to avoid any excessive rise in the water
table and consequent increase in soil salinity.<BR>
In the past in the MIA this sort of information has been gathered by aerial
photography at a cost of about $200,000 per season.  To do the job using
LANDSAT costs less than $60.00 per season, and there are further bonuses
in the extra information that LANDSAT provides.<BR>

COSSA Slide 20<BR>
<BR>
LANDSAT KEEPS TABS ON WOMBATS!<BR>
During a land use survey of the southern Nullarbor, CSIRO researchers were
puzzled by the bare patches of earth that appeared, dotted across the region,
on their LANDSAT images.<BR>
When they went out into the field to investigate, the base patches turned
out to be wombat warrens.  Wombats graze around their warrens in expanding
circles and leave nothing but bare earth.  This shows up clearly on LANDSAT
pictures as a white patch.<BR>
Note the other features and information that can be gleaned from the LANDSAT
image.  The vermin-proof fence runs from top to bottom of the picture. 
Notice the marked difference in the grazing pressure on either side of it.
 The line across the bottom left-hand corner is a road.<BR>

LANDSAT AND BAUXITE EXPLORATION<BR>
In this enhanced image of the Cape Weymouth area, Weipa bauxite province,
the bauxite plateau is clearly delineated.  The intense red along creeks
is probably mangrove swamp.<BR>

<BR>
SPOT REMOTE SENSING SATELLITE SEES MORE<BR>
The French national remote sensing satellite, SPOT, launched during 1985,
incorporates a number of advances over the LANDSAT satellites.  Most importantly,
it has a steerable mirror associated with its scanning system and so can
scan not only a wider area but also the same area for a larger number of
passes overhead.  The steerable mirror also permits the production of stereoscopic
images.<BR>
Data from the SPOT satellite is distributed in Australia through the Australian
Centre for Remote Sensing in Belconnen, ACT.<BR>

<BR>
HOW AUSTRALIA USES SATELLITES<BR>
Australia makes great use of satellites for communications, weather forecasting,
and remote sensing.<BR>
The communications and weather satellites are in geostationary orbit at
various locations around the earth, 36 000 kilometres above the equator.<BR>
Two INTELSAT satellites, one above the Indian Ocean,, the other over the
Pacific, are used by Australia for sending and receiving telephone messages
and television pictures.<BR>
The weather pictures Australians see on television and in the newspapers
each day are taken by the Japanese GMS (Geostationary Meteorological Satellite)
located over Papua New Guinea.<BR>
Australia now has all three of the first series AUSSAT satellites for domestic
communications.  These satellites dramatically improved telephone and television
services across the whole continent, especially in country and more remote
areas.<BR>
In orbit very much closer to earth (about 1000 kilometres up) are various
polar orbiting, remote-sensing and weather satellites used by Australia
for a multitude of purposes from mineral exploration to tracking ocean currents
and detecting fisheries resources.<BR>
Each of the two NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
satellites (NOAA-7 and NOAA-9) carries an Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR), permitting sensing of earth and ocean surface temperatures.
 The latest NOAA satellites (Advanced TIROS-N) also carry search-and-rescue
transponders.<BR>
The LANDSAT satellites (currently LANDSAT-4 and LANDSAT-5) are earth resources
technology satellites launched in the 1970s and 1980s by the United States.
 The uses for their images appear to be limited only by the ingenuity of
those concerned with remote sensing applications.  Australian researchers
have made great contributions to the field of LANDSAT image enhancement.<BR>
SPOT is the French national remote sensing satellite, placed in orbit during
1985.  TRANSIT is a series of navigation satellites operated by the US navy
since 1968, but now also in civilian use.<BR>

INTELSAT COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES<BR>
A depiction of one of the INTELSAT communications satellites located in
geostationary orbit at various points around the earth, 36 000 kilometres
above the equator.  INTELSAT is also the acronym for the company, International
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, set up in 1965 to operate global
telecommunications satellite systems.  It now has 106 member countries.
 Australia is the fourth largest shareholder.  Two INTELSAT satellites are
used by Australia, one above the Indian Ocean, the other above the Pacific.<BR>
The INTELSAT satellites are now built by US companies and placed in orbit
by space shuttle.<BR>

OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS GROUND RECEIVING STATION<BR>
Australian ground stations for receiving and transmitting messages through
the Pacific and Indian Ocean INTELSATS are located at Moree, NSW (shown
here), Ceduna, SA, Carnarvon, WA, and just outside Melbourne.  They are
operated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission.<BR>

<BR>
HOW SATELLITES HAVE REDUCED THE COST OF OVERSEAS PHONE CALLS<BR>
INTELSAT, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, was
set up in 1965.  Between then and 1977, there was a more than 10-fold increase
in the number of international telephone calls.  During the same period,
the relative cost of making a call fell to about 20% of its opening value.
 This cost reduction is directly attributable to the operation of telecommunications
satellites.<BR>

AUSSAT, AUSTRALIA'S DOMESTIC COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES<BR>
A depiction of AUSSAT, Australia's first domestic communications satellites.
 AUSSAT 1 was launched by shuttle in August 1985.  AUSSAT 2 will follow
in 1988, and AUSSAT 3 later.  AUSSAT 1 was built by the US company, Hughes
Aircraft.  It is a proven design.  Fifty of its type have already been built
and launched.<BR>
Hughes Aerospace has an offsets commitment to the Australian Government
of more than $50 million arising from its space segment contracts with AUSSAT.
 About one-sixth of this commitment has been satisfied mainly in direct
Australian content through wiring harness manufacture for the AUSSAT spacecraft,
and communications monitoring system design and manufacture for AUSSAT's
satellite control facilities.  There are other areas in which Australian
industry could become involved.  These include:<BR>
*	microwave integrated circuit design and manufacture<BR>
*	TWTA driver amplifiers and linearisers<BR>
*	spacecraft power control system electronics unit manufacture<BR>
*	spacecraft thermal blanket design and fabrication.<BR>

<BR>
AUSSAT, AUSTRALIA'S DOMESTIC COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES<BR>
The first series of AUSSAT satellites, launched between August 1985 and
September 1987 distribute television. voice, and computer signals throughout
Australia.  Saucer-shaped antennae all over the country are used to receive
the transmitted AUSSAT signals.  Some are 'receive-only' - mostly for television
reception in the outback.  Others on office buildings, at mines, or in country
towns, both transmit and receive signals.<BR>
With the launching of AUSSAT, people in even the most remote mining settlement
have begun to enjoy the same standards of communications as exist in the
cities.<BR>

THE GMS METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE VIEW OF AUSTRALIA<BR>
The satellite pictures used in Australia for making the weather maps come
from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) located 3,000
kilometres above the equator at 1400E, over Papua New Guinea.  It has a
view off virtually a whole hemisphere, as shown here.  Other geostationary
meteorological satellites are located at 00, 740E, 1350W, and 750W.<BR>

GEOSTATIONARY METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE (GMS-3)<BR>
The Geostationary Meteorological Satellites (GMS) were launched by the Japanese
to provide a weather service for the Asia-Pacific Region.  They were built
for the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan by Hughes Aerospace
and NEC.  The GMS satellite currently operational is GMS-3, which came into
service in 1984.<BR>

AUSTRALIAN GMS RECEIVING STATION<BR>
Transmissions from the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) are
received by the Bureau of Meteorology through a Medium Data Utilisation
Station (MDUS) located in the Bureau's Head Office in Melbourne.  Signals
from the GMS are received by a 5-metre diameter dish antenna (seen here)
located on the roof of the building in Lonsdale Street.<BR>

AUSTRALIAN USERS OF LANDSAT DATA AND GMS WEATHER DATA<BR>
Satellite meteorological data have a multitude of user groups in Australia,
the biggest of which are aviation and the general public.  Weather has a
strong bearing on most human activities and systems such as satellite forecasting
which enhance our ability to predict the weather generate strong interest
and demand.<BR>
Australians were quick to see the potential value of LANDSAT images to the
management of this continent's vast resources and wide open spaces.  Australian
scientists began investigating the use of LANDSAT photographs soon after
the first LANDSAT was launched in 1972.  They were particularly interested

GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) NAVIGATION SATELLITES<BR>
The Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, also known as NAVSTAR,
is based on 18 satellites, four of which have already been launched by the
US military.  The satellites are about 19,652 kilometres (10,611 nautical
miles) up.<BR>
Using microwave signals, the GPS system will work day and night, in fog
or rain, and provide an accuracy of 10 metres in both location and altitude.
 Ships, aircraft, and road vehicles will be able to navigate anywhere in
Australia using the system.  Ships will be able to identify ocean currents
and will use this information to help reduce their fuel costs.<BR>
Military users of NAVSTAR/GPS employ the encrypted P code, civilians use
the less accurate C/A code.  It is expected that by the year 2000 the level
of accuracy achievable by the military system will be acknowledged and will
become available to all users.<BR>

AUSTRALIAN AVHRR ANTENNA<BR>
This antenna was designed by the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research,
and built by PCM Electronics Pty Ltd a Melbourne company, to receive Advanced
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) pictures from the polar-orbiting
NOAA weather satellites.<BR>
AVHRR is the most spectacular of the instruments carried by the NOAA satellites.
 It scans five regions of the spectrum, from the visible to the infra-red,
across a swathe 3000 kilometres wide and with a resolution down to 1 kilometre.
 AVHRR pictures are proving very useful to Australia in meteorology, oceanography,
agriculture, environmental studies, etc.<BR>

NOAA-AVHRR PICTURE OF THE LEEUWIN CURRENT<BR>
The warm Leeuwin Current (deep yellow) swirls among the cooler water (brown)
of the Indian Ocean.  The coast of Western Australia is stark blue.  This
picture is a view from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
carried by the American NOAA polar-orbiting weather satellites.  The radiometer
is used here to map the temperature of the sea surface.<BR>
CSIRO and Western Australian Institute of Technology researchers built their
own receiving station and processing equipment so that pictures such as
this could be produced.<BR>
Sea surface temperatures help fisheries people to locate valuable catches
of fish.  For instance, tuna are swept south by the warm Leeuwin Current
and also into any eddies formed from it.  These are the places to begin
looking for fish.<BR>

NOAA SATELLITES SEE VOLCANIC ASH<BR>
The NOAA polar-orbiting weather satellites became vital in keeping aircraft
lanes open during the eruption in 1982 of Mt. Galunggung in West Java. 
The ash clouds from the volcano were blown across the north-west of Western
Australia, and there were near disasters when dust choked the engines of
two airline jets.<BR>
CSIRO and West Australian Institute of Technology scientists used their
NOAA tracking and receiving station to get a satellite picture of the clouds
over Broome.  Slide 36 is unenhanced, false-colour image of the area.  Water
appears as red and land as white.  Normal clouds are blue.  The ash cloud
from the eruption of Mt. Galunggung can be seen running NW-SE just to the
west of Broome.  The cloud is much more clearly delineated in Slide 37.
 The researchers were able to map the cloud by 'fingerprinting' it through
the thermal properties of silicon dioxide, present only in the ash.<BR>

ENHANCED NOAA IMAGES MAP SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES<BR>
Images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carried
by the Polar-orbiting NOAA weather satellites can be enhanced by selecting
a range of intensities within an image and assigning a particular colour
to each of the values within the range.  By this means, detailed maps of
sea surface temperatures can be produced.  Slide 38 is an unenhanced, false-colour
image of the Spencer Gulf are near Adelaide.  In Slide 39 the image has
been enhanced by the method just described.  Colour intervals signify temperature
differences of 0.40c.  Red signifies 270c, blue 160c.  The land appears
as black.<BR>

COASTAL ZONE COLOUR SCANNING OF NORTH QUEENSLAND<BR>
The Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) was a sensing device carried by the
polar-orbiting US remote-sensing satellite, NIMBUS.  Slide 40 shows a CZCS
image of north Queensland with the string of small reefs making up about
half of the Great Barrier Reef just off the coast.  Slide 42 is the same
picture but with a 'theme' painted on it.  The theme in this instance is
the light reflected in the spectral band sensitive to chlorophyll.  This
green pigment is found in plants, so the theme is a measure of the concentration
of phytoplankton, tiny marine organisms that photosynthesize and are the
first link in marine food chains.  The yellow areas show the greatest concentration
of phytoplankton, the green slightly less, and the orange the smallest concentration.<BR>

AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT OF SATELLITE SCANNERS AND SENSORS<BR>
Satellite remote-sensing is a natural progression from aerial survey work.
 Much of the development work on the scanners and sensors that are eventually
installed in satellites is done using specially equipped aircraft such as
this Fokker Friendship belonging to CSIRO.<BR>

DETECTING BUSHFIRE HOT SPOTS FROM THE AIR<BR>
The hot spots of bushfires (Slide 44) - often the areas of fires which need
to be dealt with to bring them under control - are difficult to detect from
the ground and, because of smoke, may not be visible from the air.<BR>
They can, however, be readily 'seen' (Slide 45) by an aircraft-borne infra-red
scanner.  Scanners of this type are very similar to devices such as the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carried by the NOAA satellites,
but of course provide higher resolution because they fly closer to the ground.<BR>

CSIRO RESOURCES IN SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY<BR>
CSIRO already has substantial resources and expertise in space science and
technology.  In 1984, CSIRO's direct investment in space research was $1.4
million.  This research was being carried out in at least 15 Divisions of
the Organization.<BR>

HOW COSSA WILL DISTRIBUTE RESEARCH FUNDS<BR>
Of the R&amp;D funds it disburses, COSSA intends to allocate 80% of the
total to applied science and the remainder to more fundamental research.
 Industry groups will get the mammoth share of all research funds - 70%
- the rest going to CSIRO in-house research activities to support work in
industry.<BR>

WHY AN AUSTRALIAN SPACE PROGRAM?<BR>
,Spacecraft are becoming an integral part of national and international
systems for communications, meteorology, resource management, surveillance,
remote sensing, navigation, search-and-rescue, and national security.  An
Australian space program will bring great economic and social benefits to
users n many groups spread throughout the community.<BR>
A strategically planned space program will also stimulate industrial development.
 Export sales of Australian built space equipment may partly offset falling
export income from agricultural production.<BR>
An operational space program will give Australia international influence
and access to data and systems reserved for members of the 'space club'.<BR>
Last, but not least, the experience of other countries has pointed up the
enormous technological spin-offs that come from industrial involvement in
space R&amp;D.<BR>

LESSONS FROM THE CANADIAN SPACE PROGRAM<BR>
Primed by government, the Canadian space industry has been particularly
successful.  It now manufactures twice as much space technology as is used
in Canada.  The Canadians now build their own communications satellites
and, against stiff competition, obtained the contract to supply Brazil's
communications satellite, BRAZILSAT.  The Canadian government 'volunteered'
to provide the 'manipulator arm' for the US shuttle.  It cost $130 million
to make this 'gift', but it gave the Canadians second-to-none experience
in robotics.<BR>
The Canadians' problems were similar to those faced by Australia:-<BR>
	*	A small population<BR>
	*	Great distances<BR>
	*	A hostile terrain<BR>
	*	An agricultural and mineral-based economy<BR>
	*	A serious brain drain of the best people<BR>
	*	A strong temptation to buy imported technology.<BR>
The Canadian Government's decision to invest in space R&amp;D to help solve
many of these problems has paid off handsomely.<BR>

HIGH TECHNOLOGY BENEFITS OF A SPACE INDUSTRY<BR>
Through what we can term the 'technology amplifier', the establishment of
an Australian space industry can be expected to yield enormous financial
rewards.  Development of the skills, expertise, and technologies required
to solve immediate and foreseeable needs will not only yield short-term
returns, but will also open up new vistas in diverse areas.  The magnitude
of the returns from these technological spin-offs can only be guessed at.<BR>

SOME ECONOMIC LESSONS FROM LANDSAT USE IN AUSTRALIA<BR>
Although Australia has made great and innovative use of LANDSAT data, the
government approach to LANDSAT applications has been piecemeal.  An Australian
LANDSAT Receiving Station was not opened until 1979, 7 years after the launch
of LANDSAT 1.  It was built by a Canadian firm.<BR>
When the LANDSAT Station was opened, it was as an experimental rather than
an operational system, yet it was decided to attempt to achieve 100% cost
recovery, a concept unheard of elsewhere in the world and against all notions
of fostering new technology.  As a result, prices rose so much that the
growth in innovative and economically important uses of LANDSAT data was
halted.  It is instructive to note that the Australian LANDSAT Station achieves
the highest cost recovery of any such facility in the world and its success
in this regard is due to the large and sophisticated user community generating
demand for its products.<BR>
Technological changes in the space sector will mean that the Alice Springs
LANDSAT facility will be unable to receive remote sensing data after 1986.
 No decisions have been made as yet, but there is not doubt that we will
be forced, by operational requirements, to quickly purchase new ground systems
from overseas suppliers.  While Australia has the technical ability to produce
its own ground systems it will not have the time to do so.<BR>

OPERATIONAL EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES<BR>
There are currently 10 operational earth observation satellites.<BR>
Way out in geostationary orbit, about 36,000 kilometres above the equator,
are the various weather satellites:-<BR>
GMS,  launched by Japan, provides weather services for the Asian-Pacific
region.  Located above Papua New Guinea, this is the satellite from which
Australia receives its weather pictures.<BR>
GOES-W and GOES-E (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) were
launched by the US in the early 1980s.  They were built for NOAA (National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) by Hughes Aerospace in the US. 
The two GOES satellites observe the western and eastern United States and
the adjacent ocean areas, but their coverage extends well into the Southern
Hemisphere.  The satellites make day and night observations of weather in
the coverage area, monitor cataclysmic weather events such as hurricanes
and other severe storms, relay meteorological observation data from surface
collection points to a processing centre, and perform facsimile transmission
of processed graphic and imaged weather data to field stations<BR>
METEOSAT  is the European geostationary meteorological satellite.  It was
built for the European Space Agency by the French company Aerospatiale,
and is now operated by Eumetsat.<BR>
INSAT  satellites are Indian multipurpose satellites, combining communications,
broadcast, and meteorology.  They were built by the US company Ford Aerospace
for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and launched by shuttle
in 1982 and 1983.<BR>
In orbit much closer to Earth (800-1000 kilometres) are the various polar-orbiting
remote-sensing and weather satellites: LANDSAT-4 and 5, NOAA-7 and 9, and
the Russian METEOR.  These variously carry an array of instruments to sense
conditions at the land and sea surface and in the atmosphere.<BR>

TIROS/NOAA POLAR-ORBITING ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE<BR>
The TIROS/NOAA spacecraft are US polar-orbiting meteorological satellites,
some carrying Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR), search
and rescue transponders, and ARGOS data platform transponders.  They provide
operational coverage of the entire earth four times per day.  The purpose
of these satellites is to make measurements of temperature and humidity
in the earth's atmosphere, surface temperature, cloud coverage, water-ice
boundaries, and proton and electron flux near the earth.  They are able
to receive, process, and retransmit data from balloons, buoys, and remote
automatic stations distributed around the globe, and can also track stations
that are in motion.  The latest satellites also carry a Search and Rescue
transponder.<BR>

SPACE STATION COMPLEX<BR>
The space station complex is a US proposal for a manned space station and
associated spacecraft in permanent orbit.  NASA is seeking overseas collaboration
in this project.<BR>
The proposed complex would consist of a core platform and co-orbiting platform
in low inclination, low altitude (500 kilometre) orbit as well as polar
platform(s) at a high altitude (NOAA is proposing 800 kilometres).  The
polar platform would contribute to the operational monitoring of the earth's
atmosphere, oceans, and land masses.  The payload for the platform would
include instruments derived from the current operational environmental satellites,
ocean satellites that will be flown by several countries during the next
decade, research programs, and land satellite systems - governmental and
commercial.  These justify two polar-orbiting, sun synchronous, astronaut-serviced
platforms.  The availability of permanent, astronaut-serviced platforms
of this type will render obsolete the expendable satellites used today.<BR>

SPACE STATION POLAR PLATFORM<BR>
NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) envisages two
polar platforms of this type giving a permanent presence in space by the
mid-1990s.  The platforms will be routinely serviced by astronauts at operational
altitudes.  They will carry 17 instruments for total operational viewing
of the land, oceans, and atmosphere, as well as for monitoring of the solar
environment, for search and rescue, and for environmental data collection.<BR>
Data dissemination  will be by direct readout at ground stations and delayed-recorded
transmissions, as well as by use of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
System (TDRSS).<BR>
The platforms will maximize use of existing satellite sensor technology.
 They also aim to maximize international cooperation in space activities.<BR>

LANDSAT THEMATIC MAPPER (TM)<BR>
The Thematic Mapper (TM) was flown as a new R&amp;D sensor on LANDSAT-4.
 It became operational (on LANDSAT-5) on 31 August 1984.  It provides much
more powerful data than its predecessor the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS).<BR>
There are 100 detectors (16 of each of 6 reflective bands and 4 for one
emissive band).  MSS has 24 detectors.<BR>
The reflective bands measure light in the visible or near infrared.  Each
TM picture element (pixel) is 30 metres by 30 metres.  MSS pixels are 80
metres square.<BR>
The emissive band measures temperature in the infrared, for 120 metre square
pixels.<BR>
Both reflective and emissive bands are quantized to 256 levels.<BR>
The spectral range covered by TM is from 0.45 to 2.35um, as compared with
0.5 to 1.1um by MSS.<BR>
The Australian Centre for Remote Sensing cannot receive TM data.  Indeed,
unless it is upgraded it will be unable to receive LANDSAT data after 1986.<BR>

SPARTAN SCIENTIFIC SATELLITE/MIRRABOOKA<BR>
SPARTAN is a reusable satellite developed by NASA in the USA.  The SPARTAN

 The carrier is taken into orbit by the space shuttle, deployed, operated
as an autonomous sub-satellite, and retrieved and returned to the ground
for subsequent reuse.<BR>
COSSA is presently investigating the establishment of an Australian research
satellite, MIRRABOOKA.  Based in part on SPARTAN, it would provide Australian
industry with substantial space manufacturing experience before the letting
of contracts for the manufacture of AUSSAT-2.  COSSA considers that the
MIRRABBOKA program is the best means for Australian industry to achieve
significant participation in AUSSAT-2.  MIRRABOOKA is also ideally suited
for fundamental and applied science experiments of interest to the Australian

VEGETATION INDEX AND DROUGHT<BR>
Through advances in satellite remote-sensing technology, we can now gain
a continental-scale impression of the effects of significant environmental
events.<BR>
The two images of Australia presented in these slides come from 1982, the
first from April, the second from December, when most of the country experience
a severe drought.  The images were composed from data collected by the United
States' NOAA polar-orbiting, environmental satellites, whose sensors scan
a track 2800 km wide.  Measurements of the light in specific wavelengths
reflected from the land surface were collected over weekly periods and transformed
to a 'vegetation index' based on 'greenness'.<BR>
A pronounced feature in the first slide is the flush of vegetation over
most of the Northern Territory, resulting from the passage of a cyclone.
 Note that the colours chosen for these particular images are such that
the 'greenest' areas appear as mauve.  These are the native eucalypt forests
and woodlands.  The prime agricultural and grazing lands in the south and
west appear as blue-green and yellow, while the arid centre is brown.<BR>
The second slide shows how much the drought has deepened during the year.
 There is some remnant of the cyclone's effects in the north, but the dry
zone has extended and the drought has intensified in the agricultural areas,
particularly in the east.<BR>

LANDSAT DETECTS DUST SOURCES IN ADELAIDE<BR>
Dust has been a perennial problem in Adelaide.  Its reduction has become
an economic problem with the development of high technology industry there.<BR>
However, before the dust hazard can be reduced its source must be found.
 This is where LANDSAT came in.  Using quick and cheap (total cost less
than $100) techniques for processing LANDSAT images the areas of bare ground
where the dust comes from were revealed.  Other methods had already absorbed
more than $20 000 and several years of work without defining the extent
of the problem.<BR>
Slide 83 shows an enhanced LANDSAT image of the Adelaide area.  Slide 84

by bare ground.  The sources of dust clearly show as yellow areas, some

LANDSAT IMAGES AND CHANNEL COUNTRY LAND MANAGEMENT<BR>
The two images in these slides are of a section of Cooper Creek in the Queensland
Channel Country about 100 km east of Haddon Corner.<BR>
In Slide 85, the creek is 60 kilometres wide and in full flood, and will
continue on to fill Lake Eyre.  The blue represents turbid water, while
the black areas are waterlogged soils.  This image was taken on 16 February
1974.<BR>
Slide 86 shows the same area on 23 July after another, earlier flood.  The
red areas show healthy vegetation that has been stimulated by the floodwater.<BR>
Information on the size and spread of floodwaters across the Channel Country
is of great potential value to the managers of pastoral properties that
abut the flood plain, for it would allow them to determine the numbers of
cattle that could be brought in from other areas for fattenting and how
long the pastures would be safely able to carry these cattle.  LANDSAT can
now provide the pastoral industry with information on both the extent of
flooding and the subsequent production of fodder for stock.  No other methods,
including aerial photography, can be considered to be as cost effective.<BR>

ERS-1 (ERS, Earth Resources Satellite) is the first satellite in the European
Space Agency's remote sensing program, due for launch aboard ARIANE in 1990.
 Its prime function will be surveillance of the oceans and coastal zones,
including ice monitoring.  ERS-1 is being built by the German company, Dornier.
 It will be the first of the new generation of radar-equipped, remote-sensing
satellites, which can &quot;see&quot; day or night, through clear or cloudy
skies.<BR>
As well as radar, ERS-1 will carry the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR).
 The ATSR is a collaborative project between the Science and Engineering
Council of the U.K. and CSIRO.  The ATSR is an enhanced version of the Advanced
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carried on the U.S. NOAA satellites.
 It can measure sea surface temperature to + 0.3oC, and thus provide information
of value in meteorology, oceanography, and fisheries.<BR>
The Division of Atmospheric Research is playing a leading role in the ATSR
project, a member of the Division having been one of the originators of
the concept being implemented in ATSR.  At the initial suggestion of COSSA,
the digital electronics package for ATSR will be manufactured by an Australian
company, under a sub-contract to its U.K. parent, with funding from the
Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce.<BR>

PARKES RADIOTELESCOPE<BR>
The Division of Radiophysics' 64m radiotelescope at Parkes has played a
big part in various space missions.  For example, it was used in 1969 to
receive the first pictures of the Apollo II moon landing.  NASA had asked
CSIRO to make the antenna available as a backup.  When the moon walk was
about to start, Command Centre at Houston was receiving picture information
from several stations, but that from Parkes was of the best quality.  The
data were relayed from Parkes by landline to Sydney, then to the OTC station
at Moree, up to the Pacific Intelsat satellite, and down to Houston to be
seen by 600 million viewers in 49 countries.<BR>

The Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) is a sensing device carried by the
polar-orbiting US remote-sensing satellite, NIMBUS.  This slide is a mosaic
of two CZCS scenes which together provide coverage of almost all of the
Grat Barrier Reef.  The top half of the slide is part of an overpass on

&quot;PIXELS&quot;<BR>
The pictures produced by LANDSAT and other remote-sensing satellites are
made up of picture elements, or pixels.  Each pixel corresponds to the average
brightness in one of the four LANDSAT bands of an 80 metre square area of
the image.  There are 7 1/2 million pixels in one standard 185 kilometre
square LANDSAT MSS (Multi-Spectral Scanner) image.  This image, of a well-known
statesman from times past, illustrates the nature of pixels.<BR>

SPACE R &amp; D BUDGETS 1984<BR>
The nations with a significant competence in space technology have all achieved
this with a sustained program of government spending.  In 1984, the largest
space expenditure was that of the US (US$7500 million) which in dollar terms
was more than 12 times greater as the second biggest commitments, those
of Japan (US$600 million) and France (US$540 million).  Germany (US$279
million) was next, at less than half of that of France, and India (US$149
million).  Canada (US$114 million), and the UK (US$109 million) follow with
half the German budget.<BR>
These budgets can be expressed as percentages of gross domestic product
(GDP) or as per capita values.  In these terms, they indicate that a per
capita expenditure of US$4-5 and a level of 0.04% of GDP yield a moderate
space effort.<BR>

Summer growth of algae is a recurring problem in the Peel/Harvey Inlet area
of Mandurah, Western Australia.  During recent summers, LANDSAT has been
used to monitor and map the spread of weed.  By using combinations of LANDSAT's
spectral bands and image classification, the density and amount of weed
can be calculated rapidly.<BR>

NOAA-AVHRR VIEW OF THE EAST AUSTRALIAN CURRENT<BR>
Slide 100 gives a spectacular view of the tail end of the East Australian
Current, a warm current that flows south down the east coast.  This picture
is a view from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) carried
by the American NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  The radiometer is used
here to map the temperature of the sea surface.  Warm water appears as red,
and cold as blue, with colour gradations between.  Eddies are characteristic
of the southern end of the East Australian Current, warm water breaking
off and drifting down the east coast of Tasmania, as seen in this image
and in Slide 101.<BR>
Southern ocean pictures such as this are a speciality of the CSIRO Division
of Oceanography's NOAA-AVHRR receiving facility in Hobart.<BR>

CSIDA SHOWS THE 'MELBOURNE EDDY'<BR>
Fogs are common on winter mornings in Melbourne.  At the height of a fog
a brisk westerly breeze often springs up and one might reasonably expect
this to dissipate the fog; it rarely does.  The reasons for the phenomenon
were predicted to lie in the physical geography of Melbourne and its surrounds;
 the Dandenongs and other high country to the east were blocking the wind
flow and therefore the clearance of the fog.  This was subsequently confirmed
by this NOAA satellite image which shows fog entrained in what has been
dubbed the 'Melbourne eddy'!<BR>

TDRSS/QUASAT<BR>
In an experiment carried out during 1986, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
System (TDRSS), operated for NASA by Spacecom, was used in conjunction with
64m radio telescopes in Australia and Japan to perform very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) in space.  Using this technique it has been possible
to obtain angular resolution equivalent to that of a radio telescope with
a diameter 1.4 times the size of the earth.  This experiment was carried
out to test the technical feasibility of the QUASAT (QUAsar SATellite) project
for an orbiting radio telescope.  Australian scientists are participating
in these studies.  The project may eventually offer significant opportunities
for Australian industry to participate in the manufacture of space sector
equipment.<BR>

THE AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE<BR>
One of Australia's major Bicentennial projects, the Australia Telescope
(AT) opened in September 1988.  It is not only a major technological masterpiece
that will extend the frontiers of the known universe but also is almost
entirely made in Australia.  This series of slides shows the construction
of the Telescope which is based in Culgoora, NSW.<BR>
Slide 228 shows the location of the seven rail-mounted antennae at Culgoora
and additional antennas at Siding Springs and CSIRO's Parkes Radiotelescope
which now forms part of the AT.<BR>
Over 80% of the AT's $50 million budget was spent in Australia.  24 Australian
companies made major contributions with the result that the project contributed
significantly to the development of Australia's high technology industries.
 The most visible contracts were those of Barclay Brothers for the railway
line, and Evans Deakin Industries for the antenna structures.  MacDonald
Wagner was responsible for the structural design and Austek Microsystems
worked with the Division of Radiophysics on the correlator chip - a crucial
component of the Telescope.  The project also involved the design and construction
of low noise receivers, a fibre optics signal network linking the antennas,
systems to correlate signals from pairs of antennas, servo-control systems
for controlling the antennas and computing facilities to control the instrument
and handle incoming data.<BR>

THE JINDALEE OVER THE HORIZON RADAR<BR>
The Jindalee over the horizon radar has been operated since 1976 by the
Australian Department of Defence.  The radar array is located in Alice Springs
in the centre of Australia but its range allows it to &quot;see&quot; well
beyond the continental edges of Australia as is shown by this slide.  The
radar is sensitive enough to enable derivation of surface wind direction
maps which are then sent by landline to the Bureau of Meteorology in real
time in Melbourne to assist them with weather forecasting and particularly
cyclone prediction.<BR>

ERS-1 ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY<BR>
COSSA co-ordinated an Australia wide effort to provide a uniform Australian
response to ESA's ERS-1 Announcement of Opportunity issued during 1986.
 9% of the world-wide acceptances for the AO came from Australian researchers.
 Such a high acceptance rate is unprecedented and will ensure that Australia
plays a major role in the use of ERS-1 data as well as contributing to the
extensive calibration and validation program that will be undertaken by
the European Space Agency after the launch of the satellite in 1991.<BR>

microBRIAN<BR>
MicroBRIAN is an image processing program which was originally developed
to assist in mapping the Great Barrier Reef.  In its original form the Barrier
Reef Image Analysis Network assisted in the mapping of the Hydrographers
Passage through the Barrier Reef in 1985.  The BRIAN program has since been
developed for a personal computer and renamed microBRIAN.  The system has
proved flexible for combining data sets from different sources and utilising
and manipulating remotely sensed data from sources such as NOAA, SPOT, Landsat
and MOS-1.  It has been successfully commercialised by the company Microprocessor
Applications (MPA) Ltd and is now being marketed overseas by MPA International.<BR>

of John Brewer reef;  Raw data containing significant striping; a processed
image where striping has been removed and a water depth model passed over
the data set; a density sliced colour coding of the various water depth
zones as interpreted by the model; and finally a ground truthed representation
of real world bathymetric conditions within the reef.<BR>
307	Another example of shallow water mapping, this time in greyscale.  Real
depth data is compared to the interpolated depth data and the 'exposure'
of reef morphology to a nominated wind and wave direction has been interpreted
for both depth data files.<BR>
<BR>
308	A comparison between land surface inventory mapping using Landsat MSS
and TM data sets.  Both files have been rectified to remove sensor and panoramic
distortions and then registered to a common map base.  The MSS data has
been resampled to a 30 metre pixel enhancing onscreen comparison between
the two classifications.<BR>
309	Landsat MSS data imaged over China's loess plateau.  Raw data displayed
as a standard false colour composite is contrasted by a density sliced curvature
analysis.  Pixel spectral properties and neighbour associations have been
used to give a first order approximation of landform.<BR>
310	Synoptic scale landcover classification using CZCS data.  Landcover
classifications were developed in three distinct subsets of this scene.
 The classifications were then merged, class overlap and redundancy removed,
and then the classification was applied to the whole scene.<BR>
311	SE Australia represented by AVHRR data which have been rectified and
resampled to a geographical grid.  The Murray Darling drainage basin and
its component divisions were digitised and written into a channel of the
image.  A digital elevation model has also been incorporated to provide
an impression of surface relief.<BR>
312	Again the Murray Darling, imaged at night using AVHRR thermal data.
 The sub catchment digital strings have been used as a template and those
areas outside the region have been digitally masked.<BR>
313	In this version of the scene only the digital strings and the DEM have
been used.  The various subcatchments have been digitally labelled and colour
coded.  The landform outside the strings is represented by the DEM.<BR>
314	In this case the DEM forms the perimeter data set whilst within the
area of the catchments a raw AVHRR data greyscale has been employed to highlight
surface features.  The subcatchments are numbered and the state capitals
are labelled.<BR>

ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE SCANNER <BR>
The Atmospheric Pressure Scanner is being designed by the CSIRO Division
of Atmospheric Research to measure atmospheric pressure at the earth's surface.<BR>
COSSA has let a contract through the Space Technology and Applications Fund
to Auspace Pty Ltd to build an airborne version of the scanner, for flight
on the CSIRO Research Aircraft in April 1989.  The intention is to capitalise
on the knowledge thus gained to develop a spaceborne scanner to international
standards for launch in the mid 1990's.  CSIRO is discussing, with the Bureau
of Meteorology and the Australian Space Office, the prospects for joint
development of the instrument as an Australian component of the international
meteorological satellite system.<BR>

COSSA Slides 340 - 348<BR>
<BR>
Slide 340	Names<BR>
Names of the people involved.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 341	Location of the A-band<BR>
The solar spectrum is crossed by the black Fraunhoffer lines.  The line
marked A is the oxygen A-band.  The colours on the slide are deceptive because
the A-band is actually in the near infrared and is invisible to the eye.
 The slide has been taken with film whose response extends into the infrared.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 342	Location of the A-band<BR>
The oxygen A-band in the solar absorption spectrum is flanked by absorption
bands for water and ozone, but fortunately the bands do not overlap.  Thus,
oxygen is essentially the only absorber between 759 and 771 nm, a fact which
simplifies interpretation of the data.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 343	Structure of the A-band<BR>
This slide shows the A-band with increasing spectral resolution.  Earlier
work on remotely sensed surface pressure from A-band observations has used
the broadest resolution shown, whereas our studies indicate that the finest
resolution is required if the aerosol problem is to be overcome.<BR>
The band consists of two branches, labelled P and R, with the R branch at
shorter wavelengths.  With the exception of one singlet line in the P branch,
all lines occur in doublets.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 344	Simplified data interpretation<BR>
	The relected radiance depends on:<BR>
(1) F, the solar constant;<BR>
<BR>
(2) r, the reflection coefficent of the sea;<BR>
(3)  , the satellite zenith angle;<BR>
(4) m, the air - mass;<BR>
(5)  , the optical path length from pressure level p to space.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If the frequency     is measured from the centre of an absorption line,
and if     is at least comparable with the line width, conditions which
are satisfied in practice, then the optical path length is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, observations at two frequencies,     and     , can be used to infer
the surface pressure p, since<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Slide 345	Impact of scattered radiation<BR>
The primary difficulty we face is to distinguish between radiation reflected
from the surface and radiation scattered in the atmosphere.  Scattered radiation
generally traverses a shorter path, sees less oxygen, suffers less absorption,
and so leads to an underestimate of the surface pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 346 and<BR>
Slide 347	 The case for a multi-channel spectrometer<BR>
If it were not for scattering, two channels would be sufficient, as indicated
above.  The motivation for a multichannel instrument is best seen in the
3D plot of the contribution to the radiance from a scattering event at level
p and frequency  .  The frequency axis in the 3D plot is measured from the
centre of any one of the oxygen lines.  The scattered radiation surface
shows a prominent ridge, which means that to each frequency there corresponds
a particular pressure level where the contribution to scattering is at a
maximum.  In other words, each frequency channel responds to a scattering
at a particular level.  This is analoguous to temperature sounding of the
atmosphere, in which <BR>
each channel sees the black body radiation form a different atmospheric
level.  By combining observations at several frequencies, one can resolve
the scattered and reflected radiation.<BR>
This argument suggests that we need only observe one oxygen line, whereas,
in the instrument we have proposed, we plan to monitor alol the lines in
the A-band.  There are two reasons why we do so.<BR>
(1) The spectrum will be spread over a linear detector array, and all the
apparatus will tell us is the intensity at the i   pixel, i=1,...,1024.
 We must establish a map which assigns a wavelength to each pixel before
we can interpret the data.  This task is clearly easier if we have the full
spectrum rather than a single line, so that we can identify all the characteristic
features of the spectrum.<BR>
(2) The lines vary in strength from very weak to very strong, so the steepness
of the ridge will vary from line to line.  Thus, each line will provide
slightly different information, which will improve the resolution of reflected
and scattered radiation.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 348	Errors predicted from model studies.<BR>
This slide shows the anticipated error in the recovered surface pressure
arising from:<BR>
(1)  an uncertanty of 10% in the aerosol optical depth;<BR>
(2)  experimental noise of 0.1%;<BR>
(3)  an error of 1 K in the atmospheric temperature profile.<BR>
The errors depend upon the brightness of the sea, whose relection coefficient,
r, is plotted along the horizontal axis.  The anticipated range for r lies
between the arrows indicating 'bright sea' and 'dark sea'.<BR>
Note that r is the biderectional reflection coefficient which describes
the reflection of radiation from a specified incident direction to a specified
exit direction.  The normalisation allows r &gt; 1, odd though this might
seem at first.  (There is no consistency in the literature concerning the
definition of r.  Some authors include 4 , others include geometric factors
such as the secants of the incident and exit zentih angles).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Slide 349	Grating recording<BR>
This spectacular slide shows the recording of the holographic concave grating.
 The work was carried out by Ian Wilson at CSIRO Division of Materials Science
and Technology.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 350	Manufacture of the prototype in DAR workshop<BR>
The Division's computer controlled milling machine was used to fabricate
the optical bench and precisely position the mounts for the optical components.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 351	Schematic of the laboratory prototype<BR>
In the lab experiment we are looking directly at the sun, in order to test
the equipment and the algorithm for recovering the pressure.  The advantage
of this configuration is not only the obvious one, that we can work in a
lab instead of an acoustic resonant cavity (F27), but also that singly scattered
radiance is lost from the solar beam.  Only through multiple scattering
can scattered radiance enter our spectrometer, and the probability of such
events is low.  Thus, interpretation of the data should be easier.<BR>
(1)  The spectrometer consists of an aberration corrected, holographically
recorded, concave diffraction grating with a linear detector array in the
focal plane.  The grating has diameter 80 mm and optical speed f/6.  The
detector pixels have a 100:1 aspect ratio to maximise throughput.<BR>
(2)  The detector is cooled with a Joule-Thomso refrigerator.  To date we
have not worried about cooling, because other noise sources have been so
high.  However, the time has now come to press it into service.  We intend
to operate the detector at -80C.<BR>
(3)  The spectrometer is housed in a vacuum chamber to stop atmospheric
turbulence in the optical path and to stop heat conductions to the detector
array.<BR>
(4)  The sun-tracker is controlled by the PC and has its sensor separated
from the mirror mount.  Error signals from the sensor together with the
predicted position of the sun are used to compute corrections to the mirror
orientation.<BR>
(5)  The surface pressure is montiroed by an anaeroid barometer with electronic
readout developed at DAR.<BR>
(6)  Ancillary data on the atmospheric structure and aerosol loading is
obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 352	Laboratory prototype<BR>
The suntracker is outside the window.  Only the rear side of the grating
is visible in the mount at the end of the vacuum tank.  Getting the correct
exposure for the bright window at one extreme and the dim computer screen
at the other was a taxing task for our divisional photographer.  I think
this shot required three exposures!<BR>
<BR>
Slide 353	A-band doublets<BR>
The five doublets are shown as they appear when read directly from the detector.
 The doublets are approximately 0.5 nm apart, and the separation of lines
within each doublet is approximately 0.1nm.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 354	A-band doublets<BR>
This is the same information as in the preceding slide, except that it has
now been captured by the PC replotted.  In fact, the two traces were obtained
on different days, and the alignment of the optics had been changed in the
interim.  Hence the differences in spectral range and resolution.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 355	Spectrometer entrance slit and detector assembly<BR>
This shot had our photographer in ecstacy, even though the information content
of the slide is practically nil.  It shows the entrance slit, fold mirror
and detector array bathed in a glorious solar spectrum, obtained by allowing
sunlight to fall directly on the grating.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 356	Layout for the satellite instrument<BR>
I have folded the instrument in two places in order to make it more compact.
 The alternative would be a long thin instrument.  Physical dimensions are
approximately 500 x 325 x 200 mm.  The mass and power dissipation will need
to be estimated carefully, but both will be low, particularly the latter.
 Note that the sun will provide an excellent calibration source, because
we are not asking for an absolute calibration of each detector pixel, but
rather the relative calibration of one pixel against another.  Consequently,
the spectrum of the calibration source must either be flat across the narrow
band of the spectrometer, or have small variation which can be monitored.
 What better than a calibration source that also can be seen from earth.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 357	Scan pattern<BR>
The footprint pattern shown is simply a suggestion and should not be taken
too seriously for the following reasons.<BR>
(1)  The interpretation of the data is simplified if the reflected radiance
dominates the scattered radiance, so we would attempt to steer the instrument
to look at the brightest areas of the sea.  This will require the instrument
to either look ahead or behind, depending upon the season and the position
of the satellite.  Consequently, a complex scan pattern might be necessary.<BR>
(2)  The spacing of the footprints is dictated by the integration time,
and this depends upon both the brightness of the sea and the sensitivity
of the detector.  The pattern shown assumes an integration time of 1 second
per footprint, a figure arrived at from a sensitivity analysis for our prototype.
 I hope that this time can be reduced considerably.<BR>
<BR>
Slide 358	Data anlysis<BR>
The central part of the interpretation algorithm is the radiative transfer
model for the atmosphere.  It requires the following data:<BR>
(1)  visible and infrared data (OCTS) to detect clouds;<BR>
(2)  visible and near infrared data (OCTS) to monitor the aerosol optical
depth (perhaps using the technique that Ross Mitchell and I suggested);<BR>
(3)  TOVS/AMSU data to determine the temperature profile;<BR>
(4)  an estimate for p, the surface pressure, and r, the bidirectional reflection
coefficient of the sea.<BR>
The output of the model is a predicition of the atmospheric pressure scanner
(APS) data.  The model predicition is then compared with the real data and
the estimates for p and r are refined until the agreement between the two
is acceptable.<BR>

ENDEAVOUR PROGRAM<BR>
Endeavour is the first significant multi-disciplinary indigenous space payload
designed and built in Australia since WRESAT was launched in the early 1960's.
 The Endeavour  program was funded by the Australian Space Office (part
of the Dept of Industry, Technology &amp; Commerce) and is housed in two
cylindrical canisters which are to be mounted on the side of a NASA space
shuttle cargo bay.  The Endeavour payload - a sophisticated space astronomy
instrument - is designed to utilise the NASA Get-Away Special (GAS) concept.
 This provides an inexpensive means of flying hardware and offers significant
advantages in observation times over rocket mounted payloads.<BR>
Endeavour is designed to obtain ultraviolet images of violent events in
nearby galaxies and allow Australian engineers and industry to develop skills
necessary to design space systems and manufacture space hardware.  Auspace
were assigned as project managers for the Endeavour project, with over 100
companies participating in the project to varying degrees.<BR>

Image of oceanic fronts observed during a Westward flight into Marion Bay
off the East coast of Tasmania.  Fronts appear on the radar due to the increased
roughness and accumulation of floating debris.  Flow convergences at fronts
also cause bunching of waves and wave-breaking.  The increased stirring
at fronts increases marine productivity and fish oftern accumulate at such
sites.<BR>

COSSA Slide 397<BR>
<BR>
Image showing possible upwelling site off the Tasmanian coast.  Upwelling
results in cooler and generally more nutrient-enriched waters being bought
to the surface resulting in increased biological productivity.  The spreading
of upwelled waters results in a stretching out of small-scale waves and
hence the slick-like appearance of the surface.  Upwelled regions have reduced
roughness and show up as dark areas on a black-and-white radar image.  Regions
either side of the upwelled region may be sites of convergence and consequently
have increased roughness.  In this image, swell patterns are visible in
these convergence regions.<BR>

Image showing the surface signature of internal waves which appear as long
this undulating streaks on the image.  Internal waves occur on the continental
shelf expecially during summer when the warm and lighter waters overly cooler
and denser water.  Internal waves are excited by storms and tides or currents
propagating internal waves approach the coast, they may overturn or break
and cause sporadic mixing of the cooler nutrient rich bottom water with
the nutrient depleted surface waters.  It is expensive and difficult to
study the distribution of internal wave activity by conventional oceanographic
instrumentation.<BR>

 The bright target off the beach in the upper part of the picture is a light
aircraft.  Targets just south of Cape Sorell are the Sloop Rocks.  The radar

MICROBRIAN PROCESSING OF SLAR DATA<BR>
<BR>
COSSA's aquisition of the Ericsson Side Looking Airborne radar (SLAR) resulted
in the CSIRO Division of Water Resources being asked to develop applications
and processing tools for SLAR data within the context of microBRIAN Image
Processing System.<BR>
The images represent a summary of the work done so far.  Two study sites
are represented.  Both occur along the Murray River and contain areas of
the river system, irrigated and dryland farming as well as a range of vegetation
structures and types.  Primarily the work has focused on extracting information
about the surface medium.  For vegetated areas the SLAR will discriminate
between structural types and canopy moisture levels.  In bare areas, variations
in soil surface roughness and moisture content are distinguishable, while
research continues into the dielectric effects of soil salinity.<BR>

RAW DATA:  MURRAY RIVER SOUTH AUSTRALIA.<BR>
This image represents the starboard view of the flightline.  The split screen
image represents a flight line to the NW of Wakool NSW.<BR>
Signal values represent the relationship between the geometry of the landcover
and the source of the signal, in this case the COSSA aircraft, and the nature
of the target surface.<BR>
The SLAR is configured for X band radar reception and can be used equally
for maritime or land based projects.  Smooth surface covers will reflect
little or no signal to the antenna and will appear dark while surfaces with
a high angle of incidence to the signal appear very bright.  X band radar
is influenced by surface type, slope, aspect, cover, structure, and moisture
status.  Because of the potenial low surface roughness of water the SLAR
signal is compensated to enhance the mid range of data values, the effect
can be seen in the bright strip that runs down the image.  Before further
processing this 'gain' effect needs to be removed.  The microBRIAN program
mSLAR will compute the extent of this trend and generate a new image in
which the corrected pixel values are written to the third and fourth image
channel.<BR>

REGIONAL TREND<BR>
The average gain in brightness across each scanline was modeled and imported
into microBRIAN as as 512 pixel by 1 line image.  Using mLNRES this single
line image was resampled, in this case to be 480 lines in length.  When
displayed as a greyscale and reset using the default colour lookup table
in mPIC (option V in mJLAT) the spatial variation in brightness can be seen
as colour gradient.<BR>

Removing the regional trend shows significantly more information within
the image.  Being an airborne scanner the data is effected by the variations
in the flight line and attitude of the plane.  In the second of these two
images horizontal striping and 'flaring' is seen.  This is due to pitch
and yaw by the aircraft.<BR>

Simple display of radar as blue, MOS visible green as green, and MOS visible

rectification module mBARRY.  The SLAR had a nominal pixel size of 72 metres
and was resampled to a 50 metre base.<BR>
The coregistered data forms the portion of the image with blue tones, the
yellow strip that runs down the right hand side of the image contains MOS-1
data only.<BR>
Analysis of the relationship between a MOS-1 derived greenness index (channels
4 and 2) and the SLAR show a slight positive correlation most significant
over areas of woody vegetation.  This is consistent with the SLAR sensitivity
to surface roughness.<BR>

GLOBAL BIOSPHERE<BR>
The first truly global view of the Earth's biosphere is seen here.  The
composite image of the ocean chlorophyll concentration was produced from
31,352, 4-km resolution CZCS scenes from November 1978, through June 1981,
each of which corresponds to approximately 2 billion square kilometers of
ocean surface.  Nearly 400 million bytes of raw CZCS data located on more
than 12,000, 9-track computer tapes were used to make this image.  Land
vegetation patterns are derived from three years of daily images from NOAA-7's
visible and near infrared sensors (credit: C.J. Tucker, NASA/GSFC).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 439<BR>
<BR>
IMAGE COMPOSITING<BR>
The mosaics of all available CZCS data collected on a given day form the
building blocks for all longer-term averages.  Where more than one pass
overlaps, data for that area are averaged, but the number of passes averaged
at any one point on the Earth to form the composite varies greatly.  Here,
the results of the compositing process can be seen with daily, weekly, monthly,
and seasonal composites displayed.  Note the increased geographical coverage,
and spatial smoothing that occurs as the time-scale increases.<BR>

COASTAL FEATURES<BR>
Pigment distributions off the northeast coast of South America (upper left,
Oct. 1979) are dominated by the influence of two great rivers - the Amazon
and the Orinoco - which together contribute 20 percent of the global river
discharge to the ocean.  The Orinoco plume extends into the Caribbean, while
the Amazon plume flows north along the Brazilian coast and then meanders
eastward across the Atlantic, influenced by the North Equatorial Countercurrent.
 The tongue of cold, nutrient-rich water of the Malvinas/Falkland Current
borders on the productive waters at the edge of the Argentinian continental
shelf (upper right, April 1979).  The shallow, coastal waters which border
the Gulf of Mexico (lower left, Oct 1979) support rich fisheries.  Ocean
currents flowing past the Maldive Islands off the southern coast of India
(lower right, Dec 1979), stimulate plumes of plankton-rich water.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 441<BR>
<BR>
WESTERN BOUNDARY CURRENTS<BR>
The boundaries of the Gulf Stream off the U.S. East Coast during June 1979
(top) and of the Kuroshio Current off Japan during March and April 1979
(bottom) are revealed by the color shift between the low pigment waters
of the currents and the higher concentrations in adjacent continental shelf
or slope waters.  Note warm-core rings with low pigment concentration and
cold-core rings with higher pigments along the northern and southern Gulf
Stream boundaries, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 442<BR>
<BR>
INDIAN OCEAN MONSOON<BR>
Monsoonal variations in the Indian Ocean give rise to seasonal changes in
phytoplankton concentrations.  Here following a period of pre-monsoon calm
(May-June, composite, left), strong summer southwesterly monsoon winds generate
upwelling of nutrient-rich waters, leading to the development of bloom conditions
(September-October composite, right).<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 443<BR>
<BR>
MEDITERRANEAN<BR>
The relatively clear, pigment-poor waters of the Mediterranean contrast
sharply with the plankton-rich Atlantic waters off northwest Spain (upper
left).  Clearly evident in this view of the Mediterranean is the well-known
pigment front along southern France and Spain.  The image is produced from
30 scenes acquired during May 1980.  The gyre in the Alboran Sea near the
Straits of Gibraltar is caused by complex circulation patterns resulting
from water exchange between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean.  In some
cases localized areas of high production are due to pollution from human
activities.<BR>

POLAR PRODUCTIVITY<BR>

is surrounded by land the land surrounded by ocean, respectively.<BR>

UPWELLING DYNAMICS<BR>
Waters off Peru (left) and northwest Africa (right) are among the most productive
in the global ocean.  The Peru/Pacific composite covers 16-26 January 1980;
the Africa/Atlantic composite 16 and 22 December 1979.  Nutrients injected
by wind-driven coastal upwelling result in high phytoplankton biomass and
productivity; this supports some of the world's richest fisheries.  The
upwelling is reflected here as 100-km-wide chlorophyll-rich bands along
both coasts, and plumes of productive waters extending 500 to 1,000 km offshore.
 Island-induced upwelling generates highly productive regions around the
Galapagos Archipelago (left, center).<BR>

have also been observed in sea surface temperature, sea level, and drifting
buoy measurements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide's 447 -450<BR>
<BR>
NORTH ATLANTIC PRODUCTIVITY<BR>
The annual phytoplankton growth cycle in the North Atlantic basin during
1979, begins with the spring bloom at mid-latitudes in the western Atlantic
and appears to propagate east and northward as the season progresses, reaching
a peak in May and June.  Other seasonal features revealed by this time-series
of images are the offshore movement of the Amazon plume during fall and
the effects of equatorial upwelling in late summer and fall.  Note also
the rich waters of the wind-driven upwelling system off northwest Africa.
 The strong color signature in the North Sea throughout the year may be
more a result of suspended sediment and dissolved organic substances than
phytoplankton pigment.<BR>

For the first time, oceanographers now have the ability to view the global
distribution of photosynthetic organisms in the world's oceans from space.
 The observations made from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), a radiometer
that operated on NASA's Nimbus-7 satellite from 1978-1986, have sparked
a revolution in the way we think about physical and biological processes
in the sea.  Using techniques principally developed at the University of
Miami and Goddard Space Flight Center during the past 10 years, color images
have been produced which show the incredible variability that exists in
the distribution and concentration of phytoplankton - microscopic, single-celled
ocean plants that provide the ultimate source of food for marine life. 
The CZCS global data sets scheduled for publication from 1989 onward - examples
of which are contained in the folder - will lay the scientific foundations
for new generations of satellite ocean color sensors and will form a cornerstone
for international efforts to understand the ocean's role in the global carbon
cycle.<BR>

The microBRIAN image processing system is a fully commercial product arising
from research carried out within the Division.  The system is now widely
distributed throughout Australia and south east Asia (over 80 sites), and
commands a high degree of acceptance and respect by the growing community
of remote sensing researchers and applications specialists.<BR>
The Remote Sensing Group, together with its commercial partner, Microprocessor
Applications are continuing the maintenance and development of the software.
 New algorithms are developed for microBRIAN in the course of ongoing research
into remote sensing theory and applications.<BR>

AVHRR Data of South East Australia<BR>
In 1989 the Division was awarded funding by the Australian Water Research
Advisory Council to develop a series of remote sensing baseline maps and
procedures for monitoring aspects of the regional hydrology of the Murray
Darling Basin.<BR>
The AVHRR scanner with its compliment of visible, NIR, and TIR sensors,
its 1100m resolution, and orbital scheduling, makes it well suited for environmental
monitoring on a synoptic scale.  This image has been resampled to conform
to a 16 degree grid that bounds the Murray Darling Basin.  The visible green
signal is mapped to the green colour gun, the visible red to the blue colour
gun and the inverse of the thermal infrared to the red colour gun.  Accordingly
areas of vegetation appear green, hot areas red, and cool surfaces blue.<BR>

This AVHRR raw data image shows the confluence of the Darling and Murray
Rivers and the Menindee and Willandra Lake systems.<BR>
The orbital frequency of the AVHRR scanner allows for both daytime and nighttime
passes.  After correcting for atmospheric effects, it is possible to arrive
at reliable estimates of surface temperatures.  Moist areas show a lower
thermal difference between day and night and by comparing imagery from both
datasets over a period of time it is possible to highlight areas which may

OUR APPROACH<BR>
Duplex soils (Dr 2.12) have formed in granodiorite in the Upper Burdekin
River Catchment.  Red subsoils, exposed to erosion of ridge tops, can be
detected on Landsat TM imagery (30m pixels).<BR>
<BR>

The CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology has used Landsat imagery in its
analysis of land degradation in Kakadu National Park (Stage III).  Here,
soil erosion has occurred and also changes to the vegetation composition
in the drainage lines and wetlands.  This is a result of grazing and trampling
by buffalo, made worse by a subsequent invasion of exotic weeds.<BR>
Models of the erosion process, the interplay of animal behaviour, soil type
and position within the landscape have been developed, substantiated and
mapped using Landsat satellite image data.<BR>
<BR>

COSSA Slide 502<BR>
Much of survey and exploration geology is concerned with identifying and
recording on maps the mineral and chemical composition of materials exposed
on the earth's surface.  Landsat and aircraft Thematic Mapper imagery can
provide efficient and dramatic discrimination of certain lithologies depending
on their brightness, iron oxide and clay mineralogy, vegetative cover, resistance
to erosion, landforms, spatial distribution, etc.  Certain remote sensing
systems can provide new, incremental information for the purposes of increasing
the efficiency and objective coverage of increasingly expensive field geology.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide's 503 and 504<BR>
MINERAL MAPPING SPECIFICATIONS<BR>
Identification is a hierarchical process largely dependent on resolution.
 Low (spectral) resolution systems such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)
permit class identification such as iron oxides, clays and vegetation. 
Medium resolution systems permit generic mineral identification such as
iron oxide, carbonate, A1(OH), Fe(OH) and Mg(OH) mineral groups that in
turn allow identification of felsic, mafic and ultramafic rocks.  High resolution
systems permit mineral species identification, such as Alunite, Kaolinite,
Sericite, Smectites, Talc, Chlorites, Calcite, and Rare-Earth bearing minerals.
 Mineral species identification is only possible with instruments specifically
designed for this purpose.  These must have the correct spatial and spectral
resolution and, above all, adequate radiometric sensitivity.  They must
also be well calibrated and stabilised on their platform.<BR>

Preliminary results from the Coppin Gap region near Marble Bar in northern
Western Australia.  The study area straddles both Proterozoic sediments,

<BR>
COSSA Slide 507<BR>
This first level lithological mapping compares favourably with the published
1:250,000 scale geology but also indicates scope for regional map updating
in that a number of additional, but un-mapped, formations are evident. 
Note that this is possible given no 'a priori' knowledge of the geology
because the spectral characterisation is fairly unique and the images can
be interpreted mineralogically.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 508<BR>
At Jarman Well phyrophyllite alteration in the sericitic Hardey Sandstone
adjacent to the chlorite-bearing Kylena basalt has been identified.  This
type of species identification was made from individual and averaged spectral
plots (Slide 509) and has been field checked.  This previously unrecorded
phyrophyllite occurance was originally discovered by imaging spectrometry
using the narrow-swath Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) and has been
considerably extended with the GER instrument.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 509<BR>
Smoothed, shortwave infrared, airborne spectra of pyrophyllite and sericite

<BR>
COSSA Slide 510<BR>
Pyrophyllite-like spectra have also been located from two other areas in
two different host lithologies from the Archaean greenstone sequence and
await field-checking.  In the Archaean greenstones spectral shapes and absorption
wavelengths indicate Al(OH) and Mg(OH) mineralogy in the form of suspected
Pyrophyllite or Alunite, Kaolinite or Smectite, Talc-carbonates, likely
Chlorite and Amphibole variously from the flesic lavas, granites, ultramafics
and basalts.<BR>

OCS SAMPLE SLIDES<BR>
The slides were all produced from data recorded by the ocean colour scanner
during its first test flights in September 1989.  All the images show a
dark shadow down the right hand side.  This was caused by the SLAR antenna
which was mounted underneath the aircraft within the field of view of the
scanner.  Almost all the slides are false colour images using three channels
from the scanner for red, geen and blue.  Usually channels 7,6 and 1 have
been used for red, green and blue respectively, giving colours similar to
what the eye would see.  The altitude of the aircraft determines the width
of the image and the resolution on the ground.  All altitudes stated below
are referred to sea level, not terrain clearance.  None of the images have
been corrected for aircraft motion or sampling rate, leading to some geometric
distortions.  No atmospheric corrections have been applied.<BR>
<BR>
Individual descriptions:<BR>
COSSA Slide 515<BR>
Pittwater area north of Sydney.  Altitude 3000m.  The numerous dots on the
water in the bottom of the image are moored boats.  The reddish area of
bush to the right of the road in the top of the image is probably an area
that has recently been burnt.<BR>
<BR>

COSSA Slide 520<BR>
Sewage plume from Malabar outlet (Sydney).  Altitude 2750m.  The image looks
more blue towards the left and right edges because the scanner is looking
through more air there (and hence sees more scattered light from the atmosphere).
 Sun glint near the coast can also be seen.<BR>

COSSA Slide 552 Supernova remnant (SNR) 0540-693<BR>
This is a radio image of a supernova remnant, the remains of an exploded
star.  (As with all radio images, the colours are false colours).<BR>
<BR>
The object is about forty light-years (four hundred million million kilometres)
across.  In its centre there is a pulsar, a small, dense neutron star rotating
and emitting a burst of radio waves about 20 times a second.  The central
bright spot in the image is not the pulsar itself but a region of gas that
is being &quot;fed&quot; with energy by the pulsar; this region is a strong
emitter of radio waves.  This makes SNR 0540-693 highly unusual.  We only
know of one other supernova remnant that is energised by a pulsar in this
way.<BR>
SNR 0540-693 lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the galaxy nearest to ours,
which is about 170 000 light-years away.  Astronomers calculate that we
are seeing the supernova remnant about a thousand years after the explosion
of the original star (which would have been about twenty-five times more
massive than our Sun).  It cannot be seen with an optical telescope as the
burst of visible light that must have accompanied the explosion has long
since died away.<BR>
This radio picture was made from observations taken with the Australia Telescope
over three 12 hour observing sessions in May and June 1990.  It is the most
detailed image so far made of object, which can be viewed only from the
southern hemisphere.<BR>

The Katewice region of Poland is a casualty of acid rain<BR>
One of the myriad environmental problems being monitored with remote-sensing
satellites.  The two images reveal damage to the environment over an eight-year
period in the 1980s.  Coal burning in this region produces large amounts
of sulfur dioxide, which, when combined with water, makes acid rain.  This
province covers only 3 percent of Poland, but produces 31 percent of the
country's coke, 32 percent of its electricity, 52 percent of its steel and
98 percent of its coal.  Both of these Landsat images were digitally classified,
and areas were color-coded to show the degree of vegetation.  For both images,
blue represents low vegetation, pink is live foliage, green is a middle
range of foliage and orange is a less amount.  The image at left has a lot
of pink and other colors, indicating dense vegetation and a healthy environment.
 The image at right is the same area eight years later, showing an extensive
loss of vegetation.  The <BR>
British Government and U.S. remote-sensing companies are pushing for greater
consideration of the role satellites can play in monitoring the Earth as
part of the agenda for the upcoming environmental summit to be held in June
in Rio de Janeiro.<BR>

image) are relatively recent.  A large fire is burning in the Victoria River
district, at the lower left of the image, and a smaller one in Arnhem Land
at the upper right.  Both fires can be located by their smoke plumes drifting
to the northwest.  The scale of this burning can be assessed from their
visibility from 900 km out in space.  The total area of land in this image
is approximately 250,000 km.<BR>

<BR>
COSSA Slide 663<BR>
A close-up of one section of Slide A.  Shows part of the Embley River and
a small side creek.  Mangrove communities are as in Slide A.  There are
4 prawn catch sites with relative abundances of juvenile banana prawns (means
over 4 years) depicted by the size of the appropriate dots.  Prawn catches
are in number caught per m2 trawled.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, there were many more prawns caught in the upper reaches of the
small creek.  In further analyses and experimental work we hope to relate
these variations in abundance of prawns to either area of mangroves or mangrove
community type.  The remote sensing analysis could then be extended to wider
areas to help understand regional variations in commercial prawn catches
and also to help in habit protection if we find that some mangrove communities
or areas of mangrove forests are particularly important for prawn production.<BR>

ERS-1 First Results and Images<BR>
The following 3 slides are a selection from the 24-slide ESA - ERS-1 set.<BR>
ERS-1 works in a 780 km high, polar orbit circling the Earth every 100 minutes.
 In 3 days it can cover the entire planet.  The volume of data produced
by ERS-1 is enormous; over one million bits per second just from the &quot;Low
Bit Rate&quot; sensors and 100 million bits per second from the Synthetic
Aperture Radar, SAR; the equivalent of 5600 pages of text every second:
 The &quot;Low Bit Rate&quot; data is stored on board and then dumped as
the satellite passes over three dedicated ground stations.  The SAR data
is transmitted in realtime.<BR>
Part of the objective of the mission is to make sure that this continuous
stream of data gets to its users as fast as possible.  It is preprocessed
at Kiruna, in the north of Sweden, and then sent on to users before the
satellite reappears, 100 minutes later, loaded with new data.<BR>
<BR>
The Synthetic Aperture Radar, or SAR as it is known, is the most spectacular
instrument onboard ERS-1.  Unlike the human eye, radar does not depend upon
the visible wavelengths of light; night or day, the SAR produces high quality
imagery of the surface of the Earth, Water, ice, vegetation, urban areas
- these all backscatter radar frequencies at different intensities.  The
resolution of the SAR is high enough to produce an image, comparable to
that of an optically produced photograph, but containing much more information.
 The environmental data coming from the SAR are therefore very considerable
- covering many features, ranging from oil pollution on the sea surface,
to denuded rainforests.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 676<BR>
Thames Estuary, UK<BR>
The radar on ERS-1 is sensitive to small changes in the roughness of the
object which it is observing and this explains why the water surface takes
various aspects.<BR>
Water surface roughness is affected by wind, current and the passage of
objects.  It can also be indirectly influenced by features existing or occurring
beneath the surface ; consequently, it is the surface effect of these submerged
features that we see in radar images.  In this image we find details relating
to shallow water bathmetry, ships and their wakes, current flow and wind
effects.<BR>
This radar is sensitive not only to roughness but also to water content,
target geometry and orientation.  Buildings for example are very angular
structures and as a result show up as bright points in radar images.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 677<BR>
TIDAL EFFECTS IN MORECAMBE BAY, UK<BR>
The ease with which ERS-1 SAR images can be co-registered without the need
to geometricaly correct each one first, demonstrates the stability of both
the spacecraft and the processing.<BR>
The example shown here of Morecambe Bay (area of 50 km x 50 km), just to
the north of Blackpool (bottom centre), uses three images, 6 days between
each, gathered over the period 1-13 August 1991.  Highlighted in the magenta
colour are the vast expanses of sandbanks and mud flats within Morecambe
Bay that are covered by the sea at high tide and then exposed at low tide.
 Patterns within these areas are due to the various rises, dips and drainage
channels that cross the sand/mud at low tide.  This tidal effect can also
be observed to extend several kilometres inland up the numerous river courses
that flow into the bay with the low-tide water courses appearing as this
blue lines as you follow the rivers upstream.<BR>
<BR>
Using the three-image combination, the coastline is immediately recognisable
as the change from the more brightly coloured water and sand/mud areas to
the greyish overall tone of the land masses.<BR>
Although greyish in overall tone, different colours, especially in the fields
that lie between Lancaster and Fleetwood to the south of the bay where harvesting
of some crops may have begun, indicate that changes have taken place, even
over the short period covered by these images.  Towards the north the beginnings
of the hills and mountains of the Lake District can be seen, with the southern
end of Lake Windermere appearing in black at the top.  On it's shores to
the west the woods of Grizedale Forest appear in pale grey, with other wooded
areas appearing as a similar tone elsewhere in the image.<BR>
With the exception of the hillsides the brightest objects in the image are
all man-made, from the major towns of the area to a single very bright point
to the south of Lancaster.  Also visible are the thin bright lines of several
railways, the one round the bay being traceable almost without break.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 678<BR>
ISLAND OF OLERON AND GIRONDE ESTUARY<BR>
FRANCE<BR>
The image shows an area of the ATLANTIC COAST of FRANCE, between the harbour
of LA ROCHELLE (in bright tones, upper left) and the GIRONDE estuary (bottom
right).  The island of RE is visible (top left) and the island of OLERON
(centre left).<BR>
The image demonstrates the capacity of the SAR of ERS-1 to sense the various
features of the sea surface.  The swell (wavelength approx. 130m), clearly
visible here, rises from the west and moves towards the coastline.  At the
entrance to the PERTUIS ANTIOCHE, between the two islands, the swell can
be seen to deviate towards the south.<BR>
Another interesting feature is the swell refraction around the reef of CORDOUAN,
at the entrance to the GIRONDE estuary.  A black area is visible indicating
calm water, sheltered from the wind.  Some large strips are clearly identifiable
across the estuary.  They are probably due to the interaction of currents
belonging to the river and the ocean.<BR>
Inland, one can recognise the LANDES forest, between the GIRONDE estuary
and the ocean.  The CHARENTE valley can be seen from SAINTES (centre right)
to ROCHEFORT, near the coast.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 679<BR>
STRAIT OF BONIFACIO<BR>
FRANCE/ITALY<BR>
This image covers the southern part of CORSICA and the northern part of
SARDINIA, separated by the STRAIT of BONIFACIO.<BR>
The neatly delineated coastal profiles, the layout of the small islands,
the changing sea conditions and the corrugated inland geometry make the
image quite spectacular.  The definition and visibility of the coasts change
according to the conditions of the sea, but the small islands of CAVALLO
and LAVEZZI are clearly visible, south east of CORSICA.  Also the islands
of MADDELENA ARCHIPELAGO are clearly distinguishable: SPARGI, BUDELLI, RAZZOLI,
SANTA MARIA, MADDELENA, CAPRERA and SANTO STEFANO and all the smaller islands,
north-east of SARDINIA. In CORSICA, the fjord of BONIFACIO can be perceived,
on the left of the southern tip of the island.  The waters of the fjord
are agitated (lighter tone).<BR>
The different sea and wind conditions are shown in contrast to the areas
of calm sea.  A strong wind is blowing from NW (20 knots) and in the whole
area the sea is rough; patches of calm sea appear only downwind from SARDINIA
(darker stripes in the sea in front of OLBIA).  The lighter stripe of water
in front of the town of OLBIA, (the three large white spots on the east
coast of SARDINIA) represents an area of rough water, raised by the wind
which enters the island from the north coast and is channelled through the
OLBIA valley down to the sea.  Similar phenomena appear in other downwind
coastal waters of CORSICA and SARDINIA.<BR>
North of OLBIA, closer to the NE coast, a small bright spot corresponds
to the small town of ARZACHENA.  Other smaller towns and villages are visible
to the left, inland.  Close to the bottom border of the image, on the left,
a light grey small surface, uniform and well delimited, in the middle of
the mountains, corresponds to the lake COGHINAS, with the surface water
agitated by the wind.  Left of CORSICA, it is possible to see wavetrains
travelling apparently in the direction NW to SE (wavelength approx. 100m),
and change slightly direction in crossing the straits.<BR>
A spectacular feature are the four large waves (wavelength approx. 3km)
to the east of the strait.<BR>

WIERINGERMEER POLDER<BR>
THE NETHERLANDS<BR>
This colour image is a combination of three black and white images acquired
at 3-day intervals over the Wieringermeer polder in North Holland.  The
area extends 25 km x 25 km and is located between the North Sea (top left),
the Ijsselmeer (bottom right) and the Waddenzee (upper part of the image).
 The colour variations over the sea are due to changes in the state of the
water's surface.  The small black area which separates the Waddenzee from
the little Amstelmeer (near the centre of the image) corresponds to sandbanks
protruding out of the water.<BR>
The Weiringermeer polder, an area of reclaimed land, can be distinguished
by its regular pattern of large agricultural fields and drainage canals
(centre and right of the image).  The old island of Wieringen, which is
now rejoined to the mainland, is visible as a dark area to the north of
the Wieringermeer polder.  From here is the beginning of the Afsluitdijk,
a long dike separating the Ijsselmeer from the Waddenzee.<BR>
The dark areas to the bottom left of the image correspond mainly to meadow
fields around the city of Schagen, which appears as very brightly coloured.<BR>
The variations in colour of the agricultural fields are mainly due to changes
in the humidity of the soil and vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
COSSA Slide 681<BR>
IBIZA &amp; FORMENTERA<BR>
SPAIN<BR>
The Islands of Ibiza and Formentera belong to the Balearic Islands (Western
Group).<BR>
Ibiza's rocky and jagged coast noticeably stands out from a rough sea, especially
in the Western area, from where it received illumination, the mountains,
showing the typical SAR folding effect, can be clearly depicted in the Centre
and North-Eastern parts of the island.  The shadows on the sea indicate
a wind blowing from the South West.<BR>
Ibiza's town and harbour are shown in very bright return.  The lagoons in
both Ibiza and Formentera show in dark which indicates a flat surface. 
Some interesting patterns are also shown over the sea surface, especially
in the North East of the island, where a wave system appears to be travelling
from the West.<BR>

the Rift Valley near Nakuru, Kenya.  Under the pressure of farmers in search
of new land, deforestation follows the valleys upstream (pale pink areas).
 The only stretch in native forest is in the NE of the image (in dark red).
 Note the isolated trees that are occasionally spared.  At the time of year
when this image was recorded, the crops had not yet covered the ground,
so fields appear in black, white and grey.<BR>

Recently burnt out areas appear dark blue, areas burnt out some time ago
in light blue, and intact vegetation in red.  In this region, tracts of
Mediterranean forest and scrub are burnt out every year.  The fires spread
quickly partly because of the uncleared undergrowth and scrub which grows
abundantly.  One reason the forests are uncleared is that farming, including
forest grazing, has given way to an entirely tourism-based economy.<BR>

'ADORATION OF THE MAGI'<BR>
<BR>
 One scene in a fresco cycle, painted by the Florentine master Giotto di
bondone.  The cycle decorates the interior of the Scrovengni chapel in Padua
and was probably begun in 1303.  Halley's Comet appeared in 1301 and served
as a model for Giotto's Star of Bethlehem'.  ESA named its mission to Halley's
Comet 'Giotto' in recognition of the fact that Giotto di bondone made the
first 'scientific' drawing of the comet recorded in history.<BR>

RECOVERY OF P/HALLEY 1982i<BR>
<BR>
Recovery of P/Halley 1982i on 16 October 1982 by astronomers D.C. Jewitt
and G.E. Danielson, using the 5.1m Mount Palomar telescope and a CCD electronic
camera.  The comet was identified by its motion of 3.5arc seconds per hour
against the star background, by its position which was withihn 8 arc seconds
from the position predicted for it by D. Yeomans and by its visula magnitude
of 24.2 (23.1 predicted).<BR>
<BR>
The comet is shown in the centre of the circle.  For comparison, the big
black spot vertically aboce it is a star of magnitude 21.  At the time of
the recovery halley was 11 AU away from the sun.<BR>

ARTIST'S CONCEPT OF A COMETARY NUCLEUS<BR>
<BR>
Artist's concept of a cometary nucleus.  The nucleus is presumed to be a
body of a few kilometers in diameter (not necessarily round) consisting
mostly of water ice with dust mixed in.  On approaching the Sun the nucleus
is heated up and releases enormous amounts of dust and gas(a few tons per
second), preferentially from the sunward side(slide courtesy of JPL).<BR>

Giotto spacecraft completely enclosed by the solar cell array and the black
MLI (multilayer insulation) blankets around the experiment platform.  The
rectangular plate between the starmapper and the camera consists of OSRs
(many small optical solar reflectors, each 2x4 cm), the square plate to
the right of the camera is a thermal shutter (Kapton foil with gold coasting).
 The spacecraft is being prepared for the solar simulation test in the main
vacuum chamber of the Intespace facility in Toulouse.  It is connected to
the test adaptor (bottom) by 12 bars, which thermally isolate the spacecraft
from the adaptor.  A cable loom (right hand side) connects the spacecraft
checkout panel with the control room during the test.<BR>

Giotto spacecraft during the solar simulation test.  During the test the
spacecraft was spinning at 10 rpm.  The solar radiation was simulated by
36 lamps with a total power that varied form 1250 to 1800Watts/m2 and an
aspect angle that varied from 35' to 130' to simulate the effect of the
Sun on the spacecraft during the various phases of the mission for verification

ARIANE 1 ROCKET<BR>
<BR>
The Ariane 1 rocket places the Giotto spacecraft in a geostationary transfer
orbit (nomical parameters, perigee: 200 km, apogee: 36 000km, inclination:
10', period: 10.5 hours). AOS MAL refers to acquisition of signal by the
Malindi ground staiton in Kenya, LOS - loss of signal, CAR refers to the
Carnarvon ground station in Australia.  After nominally 3 revolutions in
the GTO the onboard solid propellant boost motor is fired close to perigee
(before firing the spacecraft will be spun up from 15rpm to 90 rpm) to inject
the spacecraft into the heliocentric transfer trajectory.  This will be
the first time that an ESA spacecraft reaches interplanetary space.<BR>

GIOTTO GROUND STATIONS<BR>
<BR>
During its cruise phase the Giotta spacecraft is controlled by a nuber of
ground stations distributed over the Earth.  Depending on their size and
equipment the ground stations are used for different purposes and different
mission phases.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA SLIDE 732<BR>
<BR>
SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE CONSTRAINTS DURING CRUISE<BR>
<BR>
Spacecraft attitude constraints during cruise.  Throughout the mission the
spacecraft attidtude defined by the sun aspect angle(0' - Sun above the
tripod) must be kept inside an allowed corridor (light yellow) which is
given by two contraints:  The high gain antenna must permanently point at
the Earth to maintain the telecommunications link (communications constraint,
green line), and, secondly, the spacecraft must generate enough power without
being heated up too much (thermal/power constraints,red line).  The 'hot
phase' of the mission occurs at the end of December 1985 when Giotto is
0.72 AU away from the Sun.  In the event that the telecommunications link
to the Earth is lost the spacecraft will slowly drift out of the allowed
corridot.  If, however. the attitide is kept within a certain narrow part
of the alloed corridot (dark yellow), its boundaries given by the  'sheared
constraint', Giotto could be up to 12 days without contact and still remain
in the allowed corridor.  The nominal attitude strategy (blue line) is continuously
in the dark yellow part of the corridor and is based on minimum hydrazine
consumption during the cruise phase.  In this sense it is an optimal strategy
from which one must deviate during the last few days of the cruise to arrive
at the comet with the required Sun aspect angle of 107'.<BR>

GIOTTO ENCOUNTERS HALLEY'S COMET<BR>
<BR>
8 months after launch the Giotto spacecraft (blu curve) encounters halley's
Comet (yellow curve).  The encounter occurs around 00 UT on 14 March 1986,
about one month after the comet's perihelion passage.  At the time of the
encounter the Sun is 0.89 AU away, the earth (green curve) is 0.98 AU way.
 Halley's orbit is retrograde, i.e. its orbit sense is opposite to that
of the Earth and the spacecraft and, therefore, the flyby velocity is very
high.<BR>

GIOTTO<BR>
<BR>
Schematic of the encounter geometry.  Giotto will be targeted to pass the
nucleus a few hundred, nominally 500, kilometres on the sunward side.  The
spacecraft will enter the visual coma about an hour before the time of closeest
approach.  The sizes shown are not to scale.  The nucleus is only a few
kilometres in diameter, a contact surface separating the cometary ions from
the disturbed solar-wind/comet interaction region is exepcted at 1000 km,
a bow shock at 105-106 km.  The bumper shield at the bottom of the spacecraft
will protect it from destruction by dust particles impacting at the flyby
velocity of 68.7 km/s.  It is estimated that the probability fro surviving
the flyby is &gt;90%.<BR>

COSSA SLIDE 736<BR>
<BR>
GIOTTO SPACECRAFT TARGETING<BR>
<BR>
About 2 days before the encounter a final decision will have to be made
where to target the Giotto spacecraft.  Unfortunately, the position of the
comet nucleus can only be estimated because the nucleus is disguised bu
the coma dust and gad.  Based on observations fromthe Earth the nucleus
position is known with an accuracy of 500 km.  If the spacecraft is targeted
at 500 km the actual flyby distance could be anywhere between 0 and 1000
km or more.  This is not a very satisfactory situation.<BR>
<BR>
The two Soviet Vega spacecraft (only one shown) encounter Halley's Comet
7 and 4 days before Giotta and their onboard cameras will observe the nucleus
from a distance of 10 000km.  The Soviets have agreed to provide ESA with
the nucleus positions as derived from their camera images to enable Giotta
to be targeted more precisely.  NASA supports this so-called 'Pathfinder
Concept' by tracking the Vega spacecraft using precise L-Band Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) navigation techniques.  This reduces the
Vega orbit uncertainty from a few hundred to about 40 km.  Thanks to the
Three-Agency-Pathfinder-Agreement the giotto targeting undertainty is reduced
from 500 to 130 km.<BR>

at a rate of 40 kbps.  The station is owmned by the Australian CSIRO Institute.
 The data are transmitted at full rate in real time via 8 lines to ESOC
