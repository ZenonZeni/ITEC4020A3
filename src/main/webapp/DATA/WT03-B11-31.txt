AIN INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES GROWTH, OPEN SYSTEMS IN 1996

     If 1994 was a year of lab tests and technical development, and
1995 was the year AIN moved from the lab into field deployments, what
will we call 1996 a year from now?  According to many in the industry,
1996 is going to be the year AIN gets down to business.  Many carriers
now have enough services in the market to begin leveraging them and
benefitting from combined service offerings.  AIN services are
proliferating and submerging into the network to the extent that they
don't generate quite as much amazement as they used to.  
     There continues to be tremendous momentum in the AIN hardware
market, but the wireless market is beginning to overshadow the Bell
operating companies (BOCs) as a source of business according to some
vendors, who see the BOCs as reaching a "hardware plateau."  Some
industry observers believe that the solution to this problem, and the
way to create continued growth in the AIN market, is to develop open
systems.  There are forces within the industry trying to achieve this,
and outside forces are converging on the market.  There are signs
that, one way or another, 1996 will be the year AIN interoperability
finally happens for real.

  ...Getting the Flywheel Up to Speed

     On the service side, synergistic effects are beginning to appear
for carriers who plunged into AIN early.  A prime example is
BellSouth, although the carrier's lead in service deployment may be
narrowing as other BOCs increased their activities and began to catch
up in 1995.
     BellSouth's Executive Director for AIN Scott Schaefer describes
the company's AIN division as an accelerating engine, with the carrier
gaining expertise, and customers beginning to drive the process to a
greater degree.  "Because we've gotten the proliferation of AIN that
we had in 1994 and 1995, we're starting to get a lot stronger feedback
loop from the marketplace," said Schaefer.  "They've got their hands
on this stuff.  They're using it, and they're coming up with new ideas
and extensions for services that we haven't thought of before."
     Expect the geographic scope of AIN services to expand in 1996 as
well, meeting the demands of customers who want services to work the
same way no matter where they are.  The bugs will eventually get
worked out of interstate caller ID, and the recent agreement between
Ameritech and U S West to share calling name databases is a sign of
things to come.

  ...More Hardware Players

     The growth of the AIN market and the increasing opportunities for
developers from the mainstream computing market will mean more new
hardware products and new industry participants in 1996.  
     "I think more people are going to be drawn into being technology
suppliers in the AIN arena," said Schaefer, "and not just at the
Service Control Point or Service Node levels, but maybe in niches like
voice recognition as a specialty that they would integrate with a
larger platform or some other specialty function.  There's room in
there for niche players to come in and integrate their specialty
within the broader AIN platform."
     The result of these new competitors will be continuing gains in
price/performance.  Hardware and software prices dropped significantly
in 1995, and this trend will continue in 1996.  
     Chris Ebling, marketing program manager at Tandem Computers Inc.
, agrees that Tandem's prices have come down since the beginning of
1995, as have those of its competitors.
     "It's a little bit more difficult to talk about the cost for
switch-based [intelligent networking]," said Ebling.  "That tends to
be hidden a little bit more in the overall bids the switch vendors put
out, but I suspect that has come down as well.  I've heard that the
pricing of IN loads on switches has come down significantly this year,
and that was one of the larger barriers for some of the smaller
independents to getting in."

  ...No Cottage Industry Yet

     The part of the original AIN promise that has so far been almost
completely overlooked is the appearance of third party software
developers.  Despite some interest from potential developers and some
efforts from carriers to accommodate them, the anticipated industry of
independent AIN service builders has simply not appeared.
     Ebling sees this as a serious problem for intelligent networking. 
"If we don't figure out a way to get third party application providers
involved in this market, then intelligent networking will remain just
an infrastructure product and it will never really realize its full
potential."
     According to Ebling, the only way to create this market is
through true interoperability, at a level that still does not exist in
the AIN market.     "There is no common application environment that
you can develop applications to," said Ebling.  "Tandem has its own. 
Yeah, we publish it.  Big deal.  HP has its environment.  IBM has its
environment with Bell Atlantic.  So people are creating proprietary
open systems if you will.  Sure they're open, but they're proprietary
in terms of the API so that people who are developing service logic
are doing that only for one vendor's system.  There's no portability
between the systems.  There's no incentive for someone to get involved
in that market because they'd be developing for one particular
platform and it's a very high investment to develop these kinds of
applications."
     Ebling argues that this will eventually become a crippling
limitation for AIN if it isn't overcome.  "Until we can figure out a
way to provide a common application environment, I believe that AIN
will never be much more than what it is today," said Ebling.  "It will
certainly never reach its full potential."
     One force attempting to overcome this problem is the Intelligent
Network Forum, which is accepting charter members until Jan 31.  Nine
companies have so far made financial commitments to the Forum.  (For
more information on the Forum, contact John C. Nowell at 312/507-
8882.) 

  ...Advanced Intelligent Internet?

     One standard which is beginning to show its face in the
intelligent networking field is TCP/IP.  The Internet protocol is
attracting large numbers of developers precisely because it has become
the de facto standard for large- scale data networks.  From the
Internet, TCP/IP is beginning to invade the corporate LAN market and
other fields as well, including intelligent networking.
     At least one company, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories
Inc., is working on a way use TCP/IP to integrate CPE-based
intelligence with the SS7-based intelligence of the signaling network. 
According to Vice President of Network Applications Richard Pickering,
TCP/IP is bringing about "a total change in the way intelligent
networks can be designed.  There is a sea change.  SS7 has had the
last few years, and I think TCP/IP will have the next few years."
     Genesys' NetVectoring technology allows Internet platforms to
essentially send orders to the signaling network.  Genesys has
demonstrated an application that allows an Internet user to click a
button on a company's web page and generate a voice call through the
public network to the company's call center.  The Internet application
passes data on both ends of the desired connection to the SS7 network,
allowing it to set up the call.  During the call, the same application
would be able to tell the signaling network when more bandwidth was
needed, to add a video connection to the call for example.
     In this vision, the old argument about whether the intelligence
should be in the network or in the terminals is sidestepped. 
NetVectoring works by integrating intelligence in both locations.  "In
order to achieve [dynamic bandwidth control] you need the central
network intelligence to be able to collaborate with some intelligence
that's working within the application itself," said Pickering, "which
tends to be in the originator's point or the terminator's point." 

  ...A Voice Traffic Lane on the Superhighway

     The integration of "endpoint intelligence" into the intelligent
network can provide more elegant solutions to some problems than AIN
alone can offer.  For example, the ability to dynamically share the
bandwidth of a single connection among several devices has the
potential to reduce the need for individually numbered connections and
ease the number exhaust problem.  Such applications will distribute
call routing intelligence beyond the SS7 network, and require a fairly
close connection between the SS7 network and the Internet, as well as
other data networks.
     Although the process may not be complete by the end of 1996, it
is likely that the Internet will evolve into a kind of meta-network
running in parallel with other, more specialized networks, including
the SS7 signaling network and the circuit switched voice network. 
Both these networks will continue to play a role, since they are
optimized to perform critical communications functions, but their
ultimate position may be as specialized sections of a sophisticated
and highly intelligent multimedia network.

UNISYS AND BELLCORE TEAM TO OFFER NEW NETWORK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

     Unisys Corp. and Bellcore have formed a strategic alliance under
which they will integrate the NIRIS platform, a Unisys product used to
collect and examine SS7 network information, with Bellcore's NetMavin
link monitoring software.  The result will be a generic, network wide,
operations support system that promises to give carriers more control
than ever before over their SS7 network traffic.  Immediate
applications are expected in fraud prevention and traffic load
control, but the NIRIS/NetMavin combination will also allow new
applications in areas from billing to marketing.

  ...One More Network on the Top

     The alliance makes it possible to combine the local level
monitoring capability of the existing NIRIS platform with the high
level intelligence of NetMavin.  NIRIS platforms are already deployed
in some carriers' networks where they generally operate alongside a
Signal Transfer Point (STP).  Acting essentially as a packet sniffer,
the NIRIS platform reads all incoming SS7 traffic as it passes through
the STP link and collects it as necessary.
     "Through the basic component of the NIRIS platform, the data is
collected, filtered, and massaged to some degree and passed off to the
applicable application program that's looking for certain pieces of
information," explained Jerry Parker, director of sales for NIRIS at
Unisys.
     This capability is expanded to cover the entirety of the
carrier's infrastructure by networking these individual NIRIS units
together -- using a traditional wide area network -- and connecting
them to a central application server running NetMavin.  The combined
solution will allow carriers to search their networks for particular
kinds of messages and collect them at a single point to perform
analyses in near real time that can describe the status of the entire
network.

  ...Right, Now Pay Attention 007

     The NIRIS platforms do much more than passively absorb and
retransmit messages, however.  It would hardly be practical to
duplicate the entire traffic load of the SS7 signaling network and aim
it across a WAN at an application server.  Thus the NIRIS platforms
actively study the information they are receiving and only send
messages to the application server that are relevant to what it is
trying to do.  "The most effective place to collect [data] is near the
STP site," said Bellcore's Product Manager for NetMavin Mike Myers. 
"They usually have between 50 and 200 signaling links coming into a
certain STP, so you monitor the links there.  One of the tricks when
you're dealing with this massive amount of data is to effectively
manage it.  You only want to copy what we call 'interesting' or
'important' messages, and a message doesn't have to be copied multiple
times; it can be reused by each application as necessary."
     The benefits of this capability for carriers could be immense. 
"In a big network, it's not atypical for several hundred million
messages to be flowing every single day," said Myers.  "This is an
incredible source of data for a large service provider that is
presently untapped, so the joint solution is a unique way to get this
data and use it to the corporation's best advantage."
     One of the most obvious applications, and the one with the most
immediate impact on carrier bottom lines, is fraud prevention.  The
only other system capable of tracking calls across the entire network
is the billing system.  While the billing system might detect fraud
when it generates a massive monthly bill for a subscriber, the damage
is already done.
     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination will be able to pick out fraud as
it is happening.  One example that Myers cites is illegal call
resellers who operate in large metropolitan areas.  "They'll open up
an apartment or a storefront, and they'll advertise on the street that
you can call anywhere in the world for $10 an hour," Myers explained. 
"They'll have multiple lines in there, and they'll just pump calls 24
hours a day into the network.  Today's scenario is at the end of the
month, when the bills come in, the service provider realizes that this
person owes them a quarter of a million dollars.  Of course by the
time they send the bill to the customer, that person's long gone."
     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination would be able to detect the sudden
appearance of massive call volumes from a particular location, and
compare the traffic to specified criteria to decide if it should alert
a security agent.  

  ...Other Applications Await

     Fraud control is only one application area for the system, which
will serve as a generic support infrastructure.  It will also perform
tasks such as monitoring traffic for sudden surges and helping
reconstruct the conditions that created an outage so that similar
outages can be prevented in the future.  Even marketing applications
will be possible as carriers use the system to mine the tremendous
amount of data they already generate on millions of individual
transactions with customers.
     "What we're talking about today is really the first wave in using
that data effectively," said Myers, who described the philosophy of
the system as a "bit of a paradigm shift."  Instead of having the
telephone company buy "focused solutions" in which a single tool is
acquired to solve a single problem, the NIRIS/NetMavin combination
will offer a range of applications to be used by "wildly disparate
people within the telephone company.  This solution won't just solve
problems for one small part of the company," said Myers.  (Oliver
Picher, Unisys, 215/986-5367; Annie Lindstrom, Bellcore, 201/829-
4062.)

BELLCORE PURSUES INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS

     In addition to making partnerships within its traditional segment
of the industry, Bellcore is also furiously expanding into
international markets, as well as going outside the voice business
entirely.  In the last month, Bellcore has announced several key
partnerships and contracts:

*    A contract with Telkom South Africa under which Bellcore will
     provide intelligent networking consulting during 1996.  Telkom
     South Africa is currently implementing IN functionality in its
     network to serve corporate customers with such services as
     virtual private networks and toll-free calling.  Services are
     planned for deployment in 1996 and 1997.

*    A letter of intent to form a strategic alliance with the Ministry
     of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of Taiwan, Republic of China. 
     Bellcore will work with the MOEA on a series of cooperative
     development projects and jointly pursue business opportunities in
     the Asia-Pacific region.  Because of restrictions of the Modified
     Final Judgement (MFJ), Bellcore would work only on projects to be
     marketed outside the United States.

*    Separate Statements of Principle with Sun Microsystems and
     Netscape Communications Corp. under which Bellcore will combine
     its expertise with both companies in pursuit of opportunities in
     the Internet marketplace.  Bellcore plans to become a member of
     Sun's Independent Software Vendor Program and will provide
     systems integration consulting based on Netscape's Internet
     software.

BELLSOUTH ASKS FCC FOR PERMISSION TO OFFER OPEN AIN ACCESS.  

     BellSouth has filed a petition with the Federal Communications
Commission for expedited waiver of Part 69 rules in order to offer
open AIN access to third party AIN service developers.  The waiver
would clear the way for BellSouth to offer its DesignEdge service and
Basic AIN Programmability (BAP) Toolkit as tariffed services, and for
BellSouth itself to offer services built with the toolkit.  DesignEdge
and the toolkit are the first stage in a three-stage evolution to open
AIN access that BellSouth has long planned.  Providers would use the
toolkit to develop services -- using a limited set of AIN triggers and
logic modules -- which would be loaded into BellSouth's SCPs and run
on its network. (John Goldman, BellSouth, 205/977-5007)

UPSURGE IN PERSONAL NUMBERING PREDICTED

     Up to 4 million people in the United Kingdom alone will have a
portable telephone number within the next seven years, according to
Peter Gelardi, managing director of World Telecom plc, a supplier of
calling card and other value added services.  In his opening address
to the Universal Personal Telephony Conference, held in London in
December, Gelardi predicted that the rapid spread of personal
numbering will impact on employment prospects in the United Kingdom,
and have a profound effect on the British workplace.  This is because
parallel software developments will make the traditional message-
taking role of the secretary obsolete as screening and returning of
calls in person becomes much easier.
     Gelardi added that, "aligned to the growth of personal numbering
and the advent of number portability, what will be profitable for
telecommunications providers is value-added services rather than the
carrying of traffic, which ultimately will be free in the future."

FIRST EUROPEAN CONTRACT FOR TPS

     U.K. cellular operator Cellnet has signed a contract with
Telecommunications Premium Services Ltd. (TPS) of Slough, United
Kingdom, for the provision of an advanced personal communications
service to be launched during the first quarter of 1996.  The
contract, the first won in Europe by TPS Ltd. since its launch in
April 1995, is expected to be worth approximately Pounds 10 million
($15.6 million) in the first three to five years. 
     The new service, called Cellnet Personal Assistant, is expected
to attract some 10,000 subscribers in its first year, rising to
"several hundred thousand" within three years.  The service provides
single number contact for all calls -- voice, e-mail and fax.  It also
screens calls; takes messages if the call is not connected; and
immediately notifies the user by pager, short message service (SMS) or
e-mail.  According to TPS, the service can connect more than 50
percent of calls on the first attempt, compared with a U.K. average of
20 percent.
