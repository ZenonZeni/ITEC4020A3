<H2>Support for Energy Saving Measures in Germany</H2>

<H3>from Gunther Mertz, FGK, Germany</H3>

<P>
The German Government aims to reduce the energy consumption and
subsequently the carbon dioxide emissions in the residential sector
by giving financial incentives.
<P>
The following measures are to be supported:
<P>
a) The installation of solar systems, heat pumps and heat recovery
systems in new buildings as well as in the building stock. The
bonus will amount to two per cent of the basis assessment but
not more than 500 Marks per year over a period of eight years.
The bonus will be granted for measures that are completed by January
1st, 1999.
<P>
b) The construction of a low energy house with the heat energy
requirements being less than 75 per cent of the requirements according
to the 1995 Heat Transfer Barrier Act (&quot;Waermeschutz- verordnung&quot;,
WSVO). Here, the bonus will amount to 400 Marks per year over
a period of eight years and will be granted for houses to be finished
by January 1st, 1999. In this way, clients fulfilling the conditions
as mentioned above can be granted an additional bonus of up to
7200 Marks.<HR>

<H2>European Project on Natural Ventilation Inaugurated</H2>

<P>
A new natural ventilation project, &quot;NATVENT&quot; has been
inaugurated with the aim of overcoming technical barriers to low-energy
natural ventilation in office-type buildings in moderate and cold
climates. The programme falls within the European Joule programme
and will be coordinated by the UK Building Research Establishment.
<P>
The main objective of this proposal is to reduce primary energy
consumption in buildings (and consequently CO2 emissions) by encouraging
the use of natural ventilation as the main design option for office
type buildings in moderate and cold countries. It is intended
for countries with low winter and moderate summer temperatures
and where summer overheating from solar and internal gain can
be significantly reduced by good natural ventilation. It also
addresses the need to find good natural ventilation solutions
to buildings in those urban areas where external air pollution
and noise are problems.
<P>
Enquiries to Earle Perera at the <A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment
</A>, Garston, Watford, UK.
<P>
Participating countries are: Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, UK<HR>
