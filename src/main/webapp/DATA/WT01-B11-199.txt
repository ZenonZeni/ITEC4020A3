<B>May is Rabies Awareness Month
</B>

</CENTER><P>
May is Rabies Awareness Month, a comprehensive government and community partnership to educate Ontarians about the threat of rabies. <P> 
            
Co-sponsors of the program include the Ontario ministries of Natural Resources (MNR), Health, and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Ontario Veterinary Medical Association and the Six Nations of the Grand River.  <P> 

"The fight against rabies is important," said Chris Hodgson, Ontario's Minister of Natural Resources.  "We must take every precaution to ensure that all strains of rabies will eventually be controlled," Mr. Hodgson added. <P> 
 
This year's rabies awareness program focuses on cats and how they can spread rabies to humans. During May, local Community Contingency Planning Teams will be organizing activities to educate the public on rabies and rabies prevention. <P> 
 
The best protection against rabies is for people to ensure their pets are vaccinated and kept away from stray domestic or wild animals. If they suspect that they, or their pets, may have come in contact with a rabid animal, they should call their doctor or veterinarian immediately. <P> 
 
Cats left outside, especially at night, may come into contact with foxes and other wild animals such as raccoons. Rabies experts suggest keeping cats indoors, or on a leash, especially in the evening. Cats and dogs should also wear a collar which properly identifies their owner.  <P> 

There is an ongoing concern that raccoon rabies -- which has been identified on the New York State side of the Niagara River, and within 10 kilometres of the 
St. Lawrence river near Gananoque -- may enter Ontario.  <P> 

A raccoon immunization program, called Trap-Vaccinate-Release  (TVR), has created a buffer zone against raccoon rabies in that portion of Ontario between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal.  Additional buffer zones have also been created at bridges along the Ontario side of the St. Lawrence River, where infected raccoons could enter from New York State.  <P>  

Through this program, raccoons are live-trapped, vaccinated, ear-tagged and released.  MNR hopes that the TVR program will contain or slow the spread of raccoon rabies. <P> 
 
MNR's Rabies Research Unit has also developed a contingency plan on how any potential spread of raccoon rabies will be contained in areas where the animals have not been vaccinated. This could occur where raccoons with rabies enter Ontario as "stowaways" on transport trucks, recreational vehicles or boats.  <P> 

The Ministry of Natural Resources is also continuing its work on eliminating fox rabies in Ontario.  Since 1989, aerial baiting programs have taken place throughout the province and, by 2001, MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies in Ontario. <P>
