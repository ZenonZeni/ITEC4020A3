Fewer Selections but Greater Capabilities</H1>

Here's a quick look at how Carboloy is addressing the proliferation of tools: <BR>
by providing fewer chipgroove designs that can handle a wider range <BR>
of machining requirements...

<P>Turning tool insert selection is being simplified in the Carboloy Inc. (Detroit) lineup, a move that reflects not only concerns with inventory minimization (who wants to stock any more different types of tools than they really have to?) but also with changes in the way machining is being performed today (as in much less stock removal than might have been the case five or 10 years ago: think of the near-net shaped parts that are cold formed from high-strength, low-carbon ductile steels that have a whole lot 
less stock to be removed, or powered metal preforms).

<P>The company's Secolor system has gone from 14 different chip groove geometries to three. What's more, there are just three carbide grades. Even with this number the company maintains that this simple grouping can cover an estimated 75% of all turning operations on steels, stainless steels and cast irons.

<P>The chip groove designs cover fine, medium and rough applications. They have varying land widths and angles to provide the required edge strength that will break chips over a broad range of feedrates and depths of cut (a breadth which, of course, helps minimize the number of designs required). What about beyond this range? &quot;Even outside those limits,&quot; remarked Randy Milliron, a Carboloy product specialist, &quot;you'll usually get either effective chipbreaking or good tool life considerably beyond the nominal range.&quot;

<P>Factors permitting the good performance:
<UL>
<LI>Entrance angle. It's positive. Which means freer cutting and helps reduce the chip temperature.
<LI>A bump. The chip control geometry includes a bump on the insert nose. This controls the curl of the chip and limits chip contact with the insert to just two points: the entrance angle and the exit angle (which is the bump itself). Since (a) the transfer of heat from the chip to the tool is thereby minimized, and since (b) the cutting forces into the insert are also minimized, tool life is improved.
</UL>

<P>The bump also facilitates the near-net shaped machining. That is, in near-net shaped machining there tends to be a light depth of cut. This produces a thin chip that may bend rather than break. And it needs to be broken. Complicating matters is the fact that near-net shaped machining is usually characterized by higher feedrates and higher cutting speeds, which mean high heat is generated. So there's the thin, hot chip on the insert, which could end up causing cratering. The bump helps curl and break the chip and get it up and away from the insert.

<P>There are specially designed inserts for near-net shaped operations. Milliron doesn't think that the Secolor selection eliminates the need for these tools. For example, he cites forged low-carbon steel output shafts for front-wheel-drive cars. These components, machined with high feedrates, require additional chipbreaking capacity. Special tools are likely to be required.

<P>A new groove. One of the three is M3. M3 is recommended for medium applications. It can be used at lower depths of cut and lower feeds, yet it has edge strength that permits using it at higher feeds. It is recommended for near-net shaped applications. The starting land close to the nose is tilted a negative 2&#176; for a length of 0.004 in, then it goes up to a positive 5&#176; for 0.008 in. What this means is that when the feed is 0.003 ipr, the chip rides on the negative 2&#176;, so the tool performs like a negative-rake insert. But when the feed is 0.008 ipr, the chip rides on the positive 5&#176; land width and cutting forces are reduced. The insert's positive entrance angle decreases build up in the chip groove and helps minimize the hardening of the work surface which can happen in stainless steel machining operations.

<P>Today's machines. Smaller machines are out there in greater numbers. &quot;There are more lathes in use with less than 20 hp than there are with more,&quot; says Milliron. He adds, &quot;What today's CNC lathes do have&quot;--if not a lot of horsepower--&quot;is higher spindle speeds, better controls, and better drives that can handle the complex geometries or forms on a part at higher feedrates. Even a moderate horsepower machine can give you high speeds and feeds.&quot;

<P>Which means for tooling requirements: A chip groove that can accommodate high feeds yet break the chip at a light depth of cut--which, as we've seen, this system is said to 
provide.<I>GSV</I>
