The Ocean Remote Sensing Division will host an international workshop on September 25 and 26 in Boulder to prepare a 10 year Scientific Plan to Monitor Heat Influx from the Atlantic Ocean, through the <b>Fram Strait</b> into the Arctic Ocean.  The Plan will be prepared by an international team of 15 invited scientists headed by Ola Johannessen and Konstantin Naugolnykh.  Anyone interested in a copy of the completed plan should contact Dr. Naugolnykh at <a href= "mailto knaugolnykh@etl.noaa.gov">knaugolnykh@etl.noaa.gov</a>.<p>

Scientists from ETL's <a href="index.html">Ocean Remote Sensing Division</a> and the <a href="http://www6.etl.noaa.gov">Radar Meteorology and Oceanography Division</a> will participate an experiment to measure the radiative properties of water vapor and to compare several state of the art remote-sensing instruments that measure water vapor.  This campaign is sponsored by the Department of Energy and will be conducted at their facilities near Lamont, Oklahoma, from September 10 - 30, 1996.  ETL instruments involved in the experiment are three Water Vapor Radiometers and a scanning temperature-profiling radiometer. - Contact: Ed Westwater<P>

Scientists from ETL's <a href="index.html">Ocean Remote Sensing Division</a> will participate in the Labrador Sea Experiment in January, 1997.  This experiment was organized by the Office of Naval Research and will focus on the response of microwave polarimetric radiometers to high sea conditions during high winds.  ETL's 37 GHz polarimeter will be flown on the NASA P3 as a part of this experiment.  Other participants in this experiment include scientists from Georgia Institute of Technology, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the University of Massachusetts. - Contact: Leonard Fedor<P>

Dr. Konstantin Naugolnykh was elected a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America at the Saint Louis
Meeting in November of 1995 for contributions to nonlinear acoustics. Dr. Naugolnykh is with the University
of Colorado CIRES program working with NOAA/ERL/ETL.

<p>Scientists from the Ocean Remote Sensing Division are participating in the Combined Sensor Program 
(CSP) cruise out of Samoa. This cruise, brought together for the first time a complete suite of ship-borne 
remote sensing systems in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The purpose of this cruise is to study air-sea 
interaction and the radiative properties of the tropical atmosphere. The cruise occurred during March and 
April, 1996 aboard the NOAA Research Vessel <em>Discoverer</em>. Scientists from NOAA/ETL were joined in 
Pago Pago, American Samoa by scientists from numerous national labs and universities to set up instruments 
on the ship. The cruise followed a route from American Samoa, NW to 2 South, W to Manus Island, Papua 
New Guinea, and back to Honolulu, Hawaii. A concentrated period of data collection occurred in the 
vicinity of Manus Island, for intercomparison with island-based instruments at the DOE Atmospheric 
Radiation Measurement (ARM) Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site. The objective of the comparison 
is to determine the effects, if any, of the island on radiation measurements. </p>
