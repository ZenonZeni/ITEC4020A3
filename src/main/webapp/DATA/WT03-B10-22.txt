Software Publisher Salaries On The Rise, According To SPA Survey 


Software publisher salaries are on the rise, according to a recent survey
conducted by the Software Publishers Association.

The SPA's Software Industry Salary Survey 1995 reported that the average
managerial salary increased 7.3% and the average non-managerial salary rose
6.9% in 1995 compared with 1994.  The average salary for all software
publishers is expected to increase 6.6% in 1996.

Companies surveyed publish software as a primary or secondary business.  Among
the 197 publishers surveyed are Acclaim Entertainment, Edmark, Sanctuary
Woods, Grolier Electronic Publishing and Headbone Interactive.

The managerial position salary that increased the most was international
director of sales -- up 16.7% to $72,900.

Smaller Company Salaries Increasing Faster

The survey also broke publishers down into four revenue categories:  below
$500,000; $500,000 to $3 million; $3 million to $25 million; and above $25
million.

Companies with revenues between $500,000 and $3 million increased managerial
salaries 8.5% in 1995, the largest increase of the four revenue groups.  The
largest projected increase for 1996 managerial salaries was 9.2% for companies
with less than $500,000 in revenues.

Publishers with revenues of less than $500,000 posted the largest increase in
salary for non-managerial employees -- 7.8%.

The SPA Software Industry Salary Survey 1995 is free to SPA full members.  It
is priced at $500 for non-SPA members.  For more information, contact the SPA
at (202) 452-1600.

Bill Gates' "Other Company" Licensing Digital Images


All title publishers know about Microsoft.  But few know of Bill Gates' other
company -- yet.

Corbis Corp.  (previously known as Continuum) was formed by Gates in 1989.
The company is collecting rights to intellectual property, including images
from the Bettmann Archive and the State Russian Museum.

In January 1995, the company formed Corbis Media specifically to license
Corbis-owned digital images to multimedia CD ROM publishers.  Corbis images
are available in subject areas including:  the arts; biography & portraits;
history; natural & life sciences; people & cultures; political & social
issues; sports; and physical & life sciences.

The Bellevue, WA-based company can provide publishers with images within 24 to
48 hours in most cases, Mark Daniel, Corbis manager of sales, told MBR.
Images can be sent on CD ROM or via online.  Corbis Media has approximately
150 employees.

Price -- $79 to $400 Per Image

Licensing the rights to one image ranges in price from $79 to $400, depending
on how the image will be used and the total number of images being licensed.

Among Corbis Media's customers are Questar Microsystems and Future Vision,
which was recently acquired by SoftKey International (MBR, 7/21/95).

A Lot Of Money To Pay Back

Corbis Media had "significant revenues" in 1995, according to Daniel, although
he wouldn't go into detail.

Acquiring rights to all of the images Corbis owns was expensive, Daniel
admitted.  It will take Corbis a number of successful years to recoup those
investments.

Corbis Media Contact

Contact:  For more information on licensing the rights to digital images from
Corbis Media, contact Mark Daniel, manager of sales, at (206) 649-3383 or
markd@corbis.com.

E3 vs. CES Orlando Highlights First Half Of 1996 Conferences


The long-awaited battle between Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and CES
Orlando (formerly the Summer Consumer Electronics Show) highlights 17
conferences planned for the first half of 1996, according to MBR's Conference
Planner.

Both E3 and CES Orlando focus on the retail market for electronic/interactive
products.  E3 was launched in 1995 by Knowledge Industry Publications and
Infotainment World.  Much of its success stemmed from the fact that the
Electronic Industries Association (EIA) did not hold Summer CES last year.
EIA revamped the show and renamed it CES Orlando.

This year, the two competing shows will be held within a week of each other --
E3 will be held May 16-18 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and CES Orlando
May 23-25 at the Orange City Convention Center in Orlando, FL.  E3 is
projecting 40,000 attendees and CES Orlando 30,000.

Attendance To Average 4000 Per Show

Attendance at the 17 shows will range from as few as 75 for the Institute for
International Research's Intelligent Set-top Box conference up to 80,000 for
the NAB's MultiMedia World show and EIA's Winter CES.  On average, 4000 people
will attend each show.

Exhibitor rates average $26/square foot -- about $2.75/square foot less than
last year.  Attendance fees average $1200 per show, ranging from free for both
CES Orlando and Winter CES to $1995 for Demo '96.
