MK-DUKE TEAM SETS U.S. &amp; WORLD RECORD FOR STEAM GENERATOR REPLACEMENT</b></center>
<P>
BOISE -- 

     Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced that its Steam Generator Team 
(SGT Ltd.), jointly owned by MK and Duke Engineering &amp; Services (DE&amp;S) of 
Charlotte, North Carolina, completed a record-breaking 
steam-generator-replacement project for Wisconsin Electric Power Co.  The 
Team completed the nuclear reactor-coolant system's critical-path work 
well under schedule in 25 days, setting a new worldwide record.

<p>
     This replacement project at WEPCO's Point Beach Unit 2 nuclear power 
plant located near Two Rivers, Wisconsin, involved licensing, engineering, 
design, construction and complex removal of the old steam generators and 
installation of new ones on a 500 MW two-loop Westinghouse NSSS system.  

<p>
     Robert A. Tinstman, MK's president and chief executive officer, 
complimented the Steam Generator Team for its unique accomplishment.  &quot;We 
are all very proud of this industry hallmark.  It is the greatest feeling 
of achievement to know our Team not only delivers to our clients what
it promises, but it breaks a U.S. and World record doing it.&quot;

<p>
     Duke Engineering &amp; Services is a full-service engineering and 
consulting firm serving power, energy and environmental clients around the 
globe.


<p>
