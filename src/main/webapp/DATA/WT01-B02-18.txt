<P><B>*   Quality Legal Representation.</B>  At a cost of $100 per year, HSLDA provides experienced legal counsel and representation by qualified attorneys to every member family who is challenged in the area of home schooling.  All attorneys’ fees and costs are paid in full directly by the Association. <BR>

<P>Legal representation as a member means tremendous savings for a family who is prosecuted for home schooling. Attorneys’ fees vary widely from state to state and situation to situation, but these estimated attorneys’ fees illustrate the significant savings our member families enjoy when legal action is taken against them:   <BR>

<P>Response to threats by local official 	 $   100<BR>
Initial court hearings 	 $1,000<BR>
Trial in court of record 	 $5,000<BR>
Representation at appellate level 	 $3,000<BR>
 <BR>
The legal representation HSLDA offers its members extends to the appellate level.  That is, if a negative decision is issued in a trial court, we will appeal the member’s case to the appropriate higher court at our expense.  However, we reserve the right to disapprove an appeal if the particular facts of the case make it likely that a negative precedent will damage the rights of other home schoolers.     <BR>

<P>HSLDA’s service covers all defense costs as well. Typical defense costs include expert witness fees, travel costs, filing fees, and deposition costs.   Member families are responsible for the payment of any fines. HSLDA's guarantee of free legal representation does not extend to matters involving divorce, child custody, or related domestic affairs. However, HSLDA will make resources available that provide assistance in these legal matters.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>*   Court Report Subscription.</B>  Every member family receives a subscription to The Home School Court Report, a magazine focusing on legal news and other matters of concern to home schoolers.  The Court Report is published six times per year.     <BR>

<P><B>*   Satisfaction of Helping Others.</B>  Each member receives not only the guarantee of legal protection for his own family, but also the satisfaction of knowing that his membership is helping others establish their right to home school in difficult areas. Because legal precedents cross state lines, we must together maintain a national perspective in our defense of the rights of home schoolers.<BR>

<P><B>*   National Center for Home Education.</B>  To complement our work in providing legal protection for our members, HSLDA has established the National Center for Home Education. The National Center is designed to assist state home schooling organizations and their leaders by providing services that are difficult for many organizations to provide for themselves: a network for cooperation and communication between state-wide organizations; a source of information on state and federal legislation, noting proposed bills which would impact the home schooling community; and a presence in both the state and federal capitals, promoting legislation favorable to home schoolers. Armed with these resources, state organizations are better able to assist home schooling families in their own states.  Organization leaders are invited to contact the National Center for more information on the services offered. <BR>

<P>Another function of the National Center is to lobby in Washington, DC, on legislation that would affect home education and parental rights.  When we appear before legislators and legislative bodies, we represent the members of HSLDA.<BR>

<P><B>Comments from Members</B><BR>

<P>HSLDA spent over $20,000 defending our family. If you don’t think you can afford $100, where will you get $20,000?<BR>
	  Columbiana, OH<BR>

<P>Thank you so much for offering this service at such a reasonable rate. We feel so much more peaceful knowing we have Godly lawyers on our side!<BR>
	  Nypomo, CA<BR>

<P>Thank you for your help and assurances. We feel shaky treading on new ground, and it’s comforting to talk with those who’ve been there and know the territory.<BR>
	  Chicago, IL<BR>

<P>We definitely want to renew our membership but pray that we won’t have to use it. We really feel from our hearts that this money is well spent to support those who do have to use your services.<BR>
	  Hewitt, TX <BR>

<P>Thank you for sticking up for the “little guys” who want to do God’s will with their children.<BR>
	  Columbus OH<BR>

<P>We want to thank you for the prompt, kind, and helpful attitude HSLDA has displayed in our situation. It is good to know we have dedicated, qualified, and concerned people to go to bat for us. HSLDA helps make it easier for us parents to carry out our responsibilities and conviction we feel God has given us.<BR>
	  Inyokern, CA<BR>

<P>We are glad to be a part of HSLDA and we'll do our part to encourage others to join, too!<BR>
