<P><CENTER><B>Future Direction of Australian Space Effort</B></CENTER>
<P>The Government will foster a space research program to develop and launch
small experimental satellites, the Minister for Science and Technology,
Peter McGauran announced today.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The first satellite will be orbited during the centenary of Federation
in 2001,&quot; Mr McGauran said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our predecessors in the Labor Government effectively abolished the
National Space Program by terminating its funding. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Despite the stringent Budget conditions faced by the Howard Government,
we have been able to establish a space research program that is practical
and will meet Australia's specific needs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The space mission, to be known as FEDSAT, will conduct scientific
experiments and develop practical applications such as communications and
earth observation. I have asked CSIRO to play a leading role in this effort
and to develop a research plan that will include universities and industry.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The microsatellite program is an integral part of a Cooperative Research
Centre proposal being prepared by CSIRO in consultation with appropriate
partners. This CRC will develop and operate payloads for the FEDSAT mission.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Australia needs more experience in space projects,&quot; said Mr McGauran.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We will gain this in a focused, step by step fashion, drawing on expertise
already in CSIRO and our universities, and involving those companies willing
to share some of the costs. This new program will develop our experience
in managing real space projects, and will reduce the risk involved in the
more demanding and complex space projects we may want to pursue later.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are many Government departments and agencies which use space
to deliver services like communications, weather forecasting, environmental
monitoring, navigation and search and rescue. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Government will use these resources more effectively.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Synergies can be developed by these organisations working together
with Australian companies and researchers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To maximise the benefits of space and its applications to Australia will
require a whole-of-Government view of current trends in Australia and overseas.
<BR>
<BR>
The Government will establish a Space Policy Unit within the Department
of Industry, Science and Tourism to maintain an overview of national and
international space activities and set policy in the national interest.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Space Policy Unit will provide advice on space policy and facilitate
commercial space activities and interaction with other governments which
go beyond the role and responsibilities of individual organisations currently
involved in space research,&quot; Mr McGauran said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are, for example, space launch proposals for Australia which,
if they come to fruition, will give rise to a range of policy issues which
will need to be dealt with by the Government.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In recognition of the Government&iacute;s approach, the Chief Executive
of CSIRO, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, has agreed to widen representation on the
Advisory Board of the CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications (COSSA)
to include external groups. <BR>
<BR>
There is no further role for the Australian Space Council.<BR>
