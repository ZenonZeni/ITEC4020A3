Imagine being in elementary school and having a celebrity come to teach a class! Our stars have names like Foobie, Punchy, the Caring Coach, Gizmo and CyRyL. And they’re not just celebrities  ... they’re also robots!



<P>

We call our robots <A HREF="../eps/index.htm">Electronic Personalities</A> <!--link to EP page--> because of their unique communication skills.  These robots could teach children anything. Presently, our focus it to teach them to lead healthy, drug-free lives and reach their full potential.  <A HREF="comment1.htm">Teachers and education experts</A> in more than 40 states have praised the Million Dollar Machine life skills curriculum.  Some of their <A HREF="comment1.htm">comments</A> are part of this introduction. More than 1,200,000 elementary students are now benefiting from this motivational program.

This completely interactive lesson teaches children how to "Keep a Clean Machine" and accomplish their dreams in life.  This tangible foundation is the basis for the life skills lessons that follow.

The Million Dollar Machine Program comes as a complete, economical, turn-key program. It includes live curriculum installation, live parent's orientation, and unlimited use of classroom lesson plans and student learning materials. Best of all, the cost is usually for less than $3 per student for a learning experience that lasts a lifetime.



<OL>



<P>

<img border="0" width="22" height="20" src="../image/bullet_ani.GIF"><STRONG>Curriculum Installation</STRONG><BR>

One of our Electronic Personality robots personally visits each school, introducing teachers and students to the curriculum with a dynamic live assembly.  Up to 250 students participate in this interactive session, which lasts 35-45 minutes. Assembly content is age specific, so a maximum of 4 consecutive grade levels may attend any one session. 



<P>

<img border="0" width="22" height="20" src="../image/bullet_ani.GIF"><STRONG>Parents Orientation</STRONG><BR>

Each week of programs includes one evening session for parents and interested community members.  This special presentation gives parents a chance to meet the robot and understand the life skills lessons their children study in school.  It also familiarized parents with the student/parent worksheets included with the curriculum materials.



<P>

<img border="0" width="22" height="20" src="../image/bullet_ani.GIF"><STRONG>Classroom Materials</STRONG><BR>

The following printed materials are included with the program for use throughout the school year:<P><dL>

<dd><img border="0" width="13" height="13" src="../image/bullet.GIF">Each teacher receives a detailed curriculum guide containing implementation guidelines, classroom techniques, vocabulary and over 600 activities and discussion assignments

<dd><img border="0" width="13" height="13" src="../image/bullet.GIF">Each student receives a series of curriculum dedicated worksheets (duplicated by the school) reinforcing personal understanding and parental involvement with the Million Dollar Machine Program 

<dd><img border="0" width="13" height="13" src="../image/bullet.GIF">Each classroom receives a color poster promoting the curriculum

A single robot can introduce the curriculum to about 2000-3000 local students each week. With efficient scheduling, the total cost is less than $3 per student.  Neighboring districts often schedule together to decrease travel expenses.

<P>

Please read the <A HREF="comment1.htm">comments</A> from other professional educators to get a better understanding of the magnitude of this program.  You can give your children the learning experience of a lifetime by bringing the Million Dollar Machine Program to your district!

<A NAME="Funding"></A>

<H3>Who could help me fund MDM for my favorite school?</H3> 



<UL>

<P>

With a per student cost of only around $3, the possibilities are endless.  

<P>

In fact,  public spirited organizations, corporations and individuals fund more than 70% of all Million Dollar Machine installations.  Take a look at <A HREF="../working.htm"> client companies</A> <!--link to clients--> that have funded robotic presentations to get ideas.  Funding advice and presentation materials are available at no charge by <A HREF="../contact.htm">contacting GoWell & Kent</A>.



<P>

Groups that have funded major robotic programs include:<P>

<UL><STRONG>

	Health care providers & Plans<BR>

	Hospitals and doctors’ associations<BR>

	Shopping mall merchant associations<BR>

	Science and technology museums<BR>

	Large local corporations<BR>

	Individuals, parent groups and civic organizations<BR>

</STRONG></UL>



<P>

While many corporations support public causes out of generosity when they can, there are plenty of reasons to support MDM as a sound business investment. MDM’s innovative robotic instructor gives it the high visibility needed for an excellent corporate public relations program.  Visit our <A HREF="../eom/corp.htm">Corporate Site</A>  page to understand more about how corporations benefit from sponsoring robots.



<P>

We encourage you to invite local sponsors to share this educational opportunity with your area children!
