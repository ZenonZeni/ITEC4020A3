<p>A Fiscal Analysis of Marijuana Decriminalization</p>

<p><b>CHAPTER II. </b></p>

<h1>FISCAL COSTS OF CALIFORNIA MARIJUANA LAW ENFORCEMENT,
1960-1972 </h1>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19">
</p>

<p>The fact that nearly one-fifth of all California felony
arrests pertain to marijuana charges indicates that marijuana
enforcement costs constitute a significant portion of all
California law enforcement and correctional expenditures. </p>

<p>Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post, 1972 (Source la). </p>

<h2>THE BCS SUMMARY REPORTING SYSTEM, 1968-77</h2>

<p>One of the first casualties of the explosion of drug arrests
was the BCS Individual Reporting System drug offender study. By
1967, almost one-fourth of the entire BCS staff was involved in
collecting drug statistics (Source 1d, p.1). As the number of
arrests continued to rise, -the Bureau was forced to resort to a
less accurate system of summary estimates rather than keeping
track of thousands of individual offenders. </p>

<p>The Summary Reporting System began in 1968, ay-id involved
making estimates of the total number- of drug offenders -from a
30 percent sample of police drug arrest summaries and rap sheets.
When drug arrests again increased in 1969, the sample was reduced
to 20 percent (Sources 2a, pp. :13-19; 2b, p.5). </p>

<p>This immediately downgraded the value and precision of the
statistical database. A sample is an averaging device and doesn't
give very reliable information on individuals, particularly in a
rapidly changing population of drug offenders. Although a random
sample can eflect the number of people arrested in each general
drug category with some precision, characteristics such as the
age, sex, race, or criminal record of offenders were
progressively lost because there is no way to check, whether the
sample accurately reflects these individual traits in the drug
offender population as a whole. </p>

<p>Police summary forms had spaces -for the general offense
charged-how many were arrested for marijuana--- but did not
contain specific offenses, i.e. how many were arrested for
possession. Thus frequency counts (like Table 2), which are very
valuable to legislators -trying to determine the efficacy of
specific laws, could no longer be obtained from the database
(Source 1d, p.2). This meant, for example, that it was impossible
to determine how many dangerous drug arrests were for LSD, or how
many marijuana arrests were for cultivation. </p>

<p>Rap sheets -from the Criminal Identification and Investigation
bureau, part of the sample used by BCS, are based on
-fingerprints. Juveniles are often not fingerprinted:
consequently juvenile drug offenders are under-represented in the
sample. Another-- problem is that &quot;booking offenses shown on
rap sheets are poor indicators of actual offenses&quot; described
in arrest reports (Source 2c,., p.6). </p>

<p>In addition, use of the summary system led BCS to revise their
data retroactively each year--- meaning, for instance, that the
number of drug arrests in 1968 was reported differently almost
every year after that (Sources 2a, pp.43-44, 46, 61-63; 2b and
2c, p.1; 2d, p.3; 2e, p.4). To solve this problem we have
arbitrarily chosen the final estimates for these years given in
Crime and Delinquency in California, 1972 (Source 3e). </p>

<p>Finally, USE- Of the summary system meant that some
information previously reported had to be dropped. First to go
were statistics on Federal offenses in California, which have not
been collected since 1968. Then in 1972 BCS stopped reporting
misdemeanor marijuana arrests; this continued until 1978, and
injured the database permanently because the total number of
marijuana arrests each year between 1972 and 1977 cannot be
ascertained precisely. </p>

<h2>DRUG ARRESTS A MAJOR FACTOR IN RISING ENFORCEMENT COSTS</h2>

<p>California criminal justice agency expenditures rose by 67
percent -from fiscal 1967-68 to fiscal 1971-72 (Source 3e, p.62).
Much of this extraordinary increase in enforcement costs must be
attributed to the explosion in drug arrests, especially marijuana
arrests (graph DRMJ6072). </p>

<p>Drug arrests were the prime contributor to sudden rises in
statewide felony arrests. &quot;Adults arrested for felony crimes
increased by about 30,000 in 1969 over 1968, of which drug
arrests accounted for 20,000, or about 67 percent of the
increase. In 1972, total -felony arrests increased 11,000 over
1971, with drug arrests making Lip nearly all the rise...&quot;
(Source 3e, p.29). </p>

<p>Felony marijuana arrests were only 3.72 percent of all felony
arrests in 1960. By 1972 over one-fifth (21.19 percent) of the
felony arrests in California were for marijuana (Table 4: line 43
MJSPRD). Misdemeanor marijuana arrests were negligible, less than
one percent of misdemeanors. </p>

<p>During this same five years (1968-72), -the number- of drug
offenders increased by 96 percent compared to a 23 percent
increase in non-drug offenders. Also, more drug arrestees were
prosecuted; complaints filed by the police against drug offenders
rose by 123 percent, compared to 34 percent for non-drug
offenders (Source 3e, p.39). </p>

<p>The result was that massive numbers of drug offenders were
funneled through police stations, county jails, lower and
superior courts, and probation and parole departments each year.
All the trends shown in the previous chapter continued, insofar
as can be determined from the database: these offenders were
mostly white, Mostly Young (19 to 20), and mostly arrested on
felony charges of possession of marijuana (Source 2a, p.28). </p>

<h2>COSTS OF MARIJUANA LAW ENFORCEMENT 1960-72</h2>

<p>The following is a brief summary of all previous studies of
the costs of California marijuana law enforcement. In general,
the- method of these studies was to apply cost-per-unit estimates
to the number of offenders in each stage of the criminal justice
process from arrest to final dispositions For greater detail,
Consult Source </p>

<p>In 1968 Stanford law student, Lawrence Calof wrote the
definitive first study of these costs. Taking the 1966 marijuana
arrest and disposition data and applying fiscal 1967-68 budget
-figures, Calof arrived at a &quot;hybrid&quot; estimate of
$29,783,418.56 for -the 18,243 adult and juvenile marijuana
arrests and the dispositions of 14,209 adult -felony offenders.
This averages out to approximately $1,630 per arrest, or $2,100
per adult disposition (Source la, p.114; see Calof appendix). </p>

<p>To estimate the costs at each stage of the disposition
process, Calof relied not only on published budgets, but also on
numerous interviews with officials at each stage, and a sample of
Los Angeles superior court dispositions. The interviews were
necessary to form a realistic assessment of the amounts of time
spent in the prosecution of marijuana offenders. Then he
calculated the costs of taking a single offender through the
system in Los Angeles, where more than 60 percent of marijuana
arrests were made (Calof appendix). </p>

<p>Calof's study is especially valuable in reflecting the costs
of adult felony prosecution before &quot;The Wobbler&quot; took
effect. However-, Calof excluded the costs of juvenile court
proceedings, and misdemeanor proceedings in lower- court-----
because at the time these were insignificant Thus Calof's
estimate must be regarded as conservative, a minimum figure. </p>

<p>His professor at Stanford Law School, John Kaplan, used the
Calof method to calculate the 1968 enforcement costs in his book
&quot;Marijuana The New Prohibition&quot; (1970). He arrived at a
figure of about $72 million for the 50,327 marijuana arrests that
year, with emphasis in adult felony dispositions for which the
most information was available- (Source 4). </p>

<p>U.C. L. A. researcher William McGlothlin, using a variation of
the Calof method, estimated approximately $43.1 million for the
cost of 1969 marijuana dispositions. Dr. MCGlothlin excluded
certain costs which Calof had included (appeals, state narcotics
bureau, motions to suppress evidence), and used significantly
lower cost/unit estimates for court dispositions and commitments
(Source la, p.114). However, McGlothlin, not a lawyer, made no
attempt to interview criminal justice agency or court officials
about the actual costs involved at each stage, and his estimates
are not as realistic as Calof's. As at result his cost estimate
for 1969 is, in our opinion, much too low. </p>

<p>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D., a consultant to the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, estimated 1970 marijuana enforcement
cost, at $106 million. This figure was obtained by multiplying
Calof's estimate by the percentage increase in marijuana arrests
in 1970 over 1966 (Source la, p.115). </p>

<h3>THE A. ALAN POST METHOD OF DETERMINING ARREST COSTS</h3>

<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, a different method of assessing
the costs Of Marijuana arrests for 1971 gave approximately the
same $106 million figure obtained for 1970, even though the
number of marijuana arrests in 1971 declined by 3,681 from the
previous year (Source la, p.115; Table 5). </p>

<p>This new method was invented by Legislative Analyst A. Alan
Post, and was based on the fact that the overwhelming majority of
marijuana arrests are made by local police and sheriff's
departments. &quot;It was determined that approximately 25
percent of a police Officer's time is devoted to the detection
and apprehension of criminals. Therefore, it was concluded that
25 percent of the county's law enforcement budget is expended on
criminal activity. The percentage of total marijuana arrests of
the total arrests was computed for each county. This percentage
was applied to that activity. Thus, a rough approximation was
constructed of what it Costs California County law enforcement
agencies to effect marijuana arrests&quot; (Source la, pp. 98-99
and letter from Wayne Knutila of BCS to the Moscone Committee
Feb. 7, 1974, are appendix in Source 1). </p>

<p>This method revealed that in 1971, local police and sheriff's
departments spent approximately $8.9 million at the arrest stage
alone, an average of $138 per marijuana arrest. Using the same
method, county law enforcement expenditures on marijuana arrests
in 1972 were calculated at approximately $11 million, or $144 per
arrest (Source la. P.99). </p>

<p>However these figures did not, include the costs of the
California Highway Patrol, 63 per-cent of whose felony arrests in
1972 involved marijuana and other drug arrests. Adding CHP
expenditures on marijuana arrests brought the cost per arrest to
$166 in 1971 and $171 in 1972 (Source lap P.100). </p>

<p>Thus for 1971, using the Post method for arrest costs and
taking into account a significant reduction in disposition costs
caused by increasing use of The Wobbler and P.C. Section 17
(discussed below), total costs of marijuana law enforcement were
calculated at approximately $106,859,808. The 1971 estimate
proved comparable to the 1970 figure by a different method of
calculation (Source la, pp.115-117). This is further evidence
that the McGlothlin estimate for 1969 was too low. </p>

<p>To determine costs in 1972 for the Moscone Committee, two
separate evaluation techniques were used. First, the Calof method
was applied to the 1972 marijuana arrest/disposition statistics
and budgets. This produced an estimate of $95,239,536 for 1972
(Source. lb). </p>

<p>The second approach was to apply the A. Alan Post arrest costs
and Calof unit Costs to updated information, including revised
correctional Costs, supplied by every major criminal justice
agency in the state. This produced an estimate of $105,762,049
spent on marijuana Offenders by these agencies in 1972 (Source
1c). </p>

<p>The two different evaluation methods again produced comparable
results-- $95 million and $106 million-- as total marijuana
enforcement costs in 1972. We rounded this off to $100 million as
an average. This estimate is conservative, a minimum figure,
because it did not include the costs of 20,697 unknown adult
dispositions, 84310 commitments from lower court, or any juvenile
dispositions (Source la., p.113). </p>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF &quot;THE WOBBLER&quot; AND P.C. SECTION 17 ON
COSTS</h3>

<p>A close scrutiny of dispositions revealed that the major
influence on reducing the fiscal costs of processing marijuana
offenders through the courts had been Section 17 of the Penal
Code. The number of adult felony marijuana offenders in lower
courts increased sharply between 1969 and 1971, and by 1972 more
(12,346) felony marijuana cases were disposed of in lower courts
than in superior court (8,884). (Source la, p. 101.) </p>

<p>Nevertheless, superior Court dispositions nearly doubled from
1968 to 1971, because of vast increases in the number of arrests
(Source 3e, p.40, and Table 5). It took three years for the
&quot;Wobbler&quot; and Section 17 PC to relieve the congestion
in superior court. 1972 at last saw a drop of over 6,000 superior
court dispositions, largely attributable to -filing felonies as
misdemeanors in lower courts (Source 3e, p.40). </p>

<p>This reduction in superior court costs is responsible for the
slight drop in estimated enforcement costs in 1972 compared to
1971 (Table 6). Because off reduced superior court costs, We
included McGlothlin's low estimate to indicate that the cost per
arrest/disposition declined to $1,342 between 1969 and 1972, a
considerable savings (Source la,, p.117). </p>

<p>However, in 1972 there was an unexpected jump of 11,000 more
felony drug arrests, accompanied by a leveling off in lower-
court dispositions. &quot;After three years of sharp
increases,&quot; BCS reported &quot;this short boom in lower
court terminations is over. The number of felony complaints
terminated in lower courts in 1972 increased about 2000, or only
4 percent Over 1971 . The leveling-off of lower court
terminations in 1972 may indicate that the use of P.C. Section
17b5... has -reached its full potential.&quot; (Source 3e.,
p.36). </p>

<p>Another problem presented itself when 1972 dispositions were
examined. Of the 41,927 marijuana complaints filed in 1972, 8,884
were processed as felonies in Superior Court and 12,346 as
misdemeanors in lower courts leaving a serious lacuna of some
20,697 complaints unaccounted for in the BCS record books. The
apparent leveling off of enforcement costs at about $100 million
a year might as easily be the result of not having information on
the dispositions of 49 percent of the complaints filed, as of
hypothetical savings from the use of P.C. Section 17 (Source la,
pp. 101, 117). </p>

<p>In SUM, the &quot;Wobbler&quot; and P.C. Section 17 were
political compromises of limited Success. Their main effect was
to contain enforcement costs which would have been appreciably
higher without them. By allowing most -felony marijuana
possession cases to be processed in lower Courts without actually
taking possession out of the felony category, congestion in the
superior courts was reduced, with concomitant fiscal savings. </p>

<p>On the Other hand, as superior courts handled fewer (marijuana
cases, lower courts handled many more than they had in the past,
and lower-court costs began increasing as the number of marijuana
arrests continued to rise. It became evident that simply
re-shuffling offenders from superior to lower courts could
mitigate, but would not solve, the cost problem. </p>

<p>As shown in Table 6 and graph COST6072, the costs Of marijuana
law enforcement rose from about $8 million in 1960 to $100
million in 1972. It cost California taxpayers about $577 million
to punish about 400,000 people between 1960 and 1972, an average
$44.4 million a year. These estimates are conservative because
they do not include costs of many adult dispositions or any
juvenile dispositions (Source la, p.113). </p>

<p>Marijuana arrests increased tenfold between 1962 and 1967,
while enforcement costs increased ninefold (Table 6). For the
entire thirteen-year period from 1960 to 1972, marijuana arrests
increased 1385 percent, while-, enforcement costs increased 1090
percent (Table 6). </p>

<p>And what was the result of these massive Cost increases? The
Depar tment of Corrections informed the Moscone Committee that as
of December- 31, 1973, there were 621 felons in state prison
whose most serious commitment offense was violation of some law
pertaining to marijuana. In Addition, there were 858 marijuana
offenders on parole as of that date (Source la., p.109). </p>

<p>Thus Californians were spending $100 million a year to put
about 1500 people in prison or on parole. This comes to more than
$66,000 for each convicted adult felony offender. </p>

<p>One clear fact emerged from the weight of evidence presented
to the Moscone Committee: despite all attempts to reduce them,
the -fiscal costs of marijuana law enforcement continued to
increase slightly or suddenly, year after year. </p>
