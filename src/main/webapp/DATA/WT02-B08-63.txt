<h1>Thigh creams: magic, myth or medicine?</h1>

<i>Plastic Surgery News</i> / March 1994<br>

<li>While cosmetic creams claiming to help smooth unsightly fat on thigh are not a new invention, the hype over  them is.  Interest in thigh - slimming creams hit in a big way late last year after researchers unveiled a study at an October  meeting of the North American association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO).<br>



<li>George Bray, MD, and Frank Greenway, MD, Began searching over a decade ago for a chemical that would diminish the size of fat cells near the surface of the skin.  Their research brought them to aminophylline, an asthma drug that seemed to nullify the effects of a fat-breakdown inhibitor.  Together with Bruce Frome, MD, of the International Pain Research Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., the researchers found an apparently effective level of the drug and an appropriate cream to suspend it in.  They conducted a study with a group of 12 women (one of whom dropped to due skin irritation), applying the cream to one thigh and a placebo cream to the other five days a week for five weeks.  The researchers noted a decrease of 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches in the treated thighs of the group.  Dr. Greenway presented these encouraging results at the NAASO meeting in Milwaukee.  The result was a flood of new thigh creams entering the marketplace capitalizing on the publicity of his study.<br>



<li>With the complaint of &quot;thunder thighs&quot; easily ranking as one of  the most popular cosmetic gripes of women, the news of the new cream was greeted with waves of both enthusiasm and skepticism.<br>



<li>ASPRS member Charles Ettelson, MD, of Chesterfield, Mo., serves as secretary of the St. Louis Area Society of Plastic Surgeons.  He expressed the skeptical viewpoint by a local newspaper on the effectiveness of thigh creams.<p>



<h3>No credible evidence?</h3>

<li>&quot;It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal that is commonly read by plastic surgeons,&quot;  Dr. Ettelson offered, noting that some purveyors of these creams have been doing the talk show circuit to hawk products, rather than demonstrating scientifically that they work.<br>

<li>&quot;I've seen no credible evidence that these thigh creams can work,&quot; says Dr. Ettelson. &quot;I'm as skeptical as any other plastic surgeon would be hearing about a product like that.&quot;<br>

But Dr. Bray, MD, a respected obesity researcher and executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., says the results of  his research speak for themselves.  He explains how he and Dr. Greenway, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at Harbor -UCLA Medical Center, came to develop the cream.<br>



<li>&quot;When I was on sabbatical 15 years ago, it occurred to me that we knew enough about the differences in fat on the thighs and buttocks and fat on the abdomen to suggest that we might be able to 'tip' some of the fat cells in the leg area into mobilizing more of the fat.  With a colleague of mine -- Dr. Greenway at UCLA -- we began some preliminary studies in his clinical office on some different ways to do this.  After a couple of years and tests which we published  (the first article appeared in Clinical Therapeutics Vol. 9#6 in 1987), we had clear evidence that you could in fact 'tip it' and get small amounts of the superficial fat mobilized to make the thigh appear to change its size and configuration a bit so it looked better.&quot;<br>



<li>Dr. Bray says aminophylline, the active agent the researchers ended up using in the cream, belongs to a family of drugs, any one of which would accomplish similar results.  Skinny Dip, a thigh cream which has been on the market a handful of years in different formula variations, until recently used theophylline, a sibling of aminophylline.  The active ingredient was changed to aminophylline around the time of the release of the study by Drs. Frome, Greenway and Bray.<p>



<h3>In the cosmetic, not the drug biz</h3>

<li>&quot;We decided to use aminophylline because it's a compound which has been around in the treatment of asthma since before I was medical school --  and that's 40 years ago,&quot; says Dr. Bray of their formula. &quot;It's generally recognized as a safe agent and is available over the counter.  We thought something was safe and has long experience was the way to go -- we're no in the drug business, we're really in the cosmetic, the appearance - improvement side.&quot;<br>



<li>While the study documents that thigh girth reduction occurred while using he cream, there is no actual proof that the cream breaks down fat cells in the thigh.  But Dr. Bray says there is proof that aminophylline reacts with fat cells in a test tube.<br>



<li>&quot;If you have fat cells in a test tube and you put aminophylline in, it binds to what are called the adenosine (sometimes called beta) receptors which inhibit fat breakdown.  When you block them with a drug like aminophylline, you enhance that breakdown.&quot;<br>



<li>Dr. Bray explains that fat cells are governed by surface receptors, which can be triggered to release fat into the bloodstream to be burned by the body as fuel.  Fat in the thighs and buttocks differs form fat cells in the rest of the body in that they have fewer &quot;fat release&quot; receptors.<br>

<li>&quot;;There are two broad types of receptor systems on fat cells which control their function in terms of breakdown of fat,&quot; says Dr. Bray.  &quot;One is called lipolytic --  the kinds that break down fat.  The other is called antilipolytic which inhibit breakdown.  The thigh fat cells, particularly in women, have more of the antilipolytic types of receptors, less of the lipolytic.  The adenosine receptor is one of those antilipolytic receptors.  It is the modulation of that receptor, right at the surface of the thigh, which probably leads to the smoothing effects you get on these fat globules which are bulging out of the skin.&quot;<p>



<h3>Still no cure for thunder thighs</h3>

<li>Dr. Bray notes that if his cream does, as he suspects, break down fat cells in the thighs, it doesn't rival, say, liposuction.<br>



<li>&quot;It's not a quantitative fat removal process.  It's not like a treatment for AIDS, it's not going to cure anything.  They're really cosmetic changes.  We did weekly measurements to determine thigh sizes in order to give us some quantitative numbers.  It takes two or three weeks to get a size change; that means that the cosmetic effects have already occurred because they're going to be there before you can measure anything.  And we know from people who have weight problems who have regained weight and are not continuing to use this, it will recur.  So it's like any cosmetic, if you don't continue to use it, the problem will recur.  We haven't permanently changed anything at all.&quot;<br>



<li>Sherrel Aston, MD, ASPRS member and president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, remains skeptical of the creams, and points out that the evidence that aminophylline creams are effective is very slim.  &quot;From a physiological standpoint, it doesn't seem reasonable to think that it would make the thighs shrink.  I would say buyer beware.  I need to see how it works physiologically and see the results before I can buy that.&quot;<br>



<li>But Dr. Bray suggests that the cream may be a good tool for plastic surgeons if used as an adjunct to liposuction.<br>



<li>&quot;Because with liposuction you take out fat in one area,&quot; says Dr. Bray. &quot;The junction between the area where you use liposuction and where you don't is where you're likely to get puckering, because of the fat that's left behind.  I can see the cream as a very real benefit if used around the area where they've done liposuction.&quot;<p>



<h3>Enhancing liposuction results</h3>

<li>Joel Singer, MD, a Connecticut ASPRS member who has used the cream on his patients, agrees.<br>

<li>&quot;it gives us a topical cream that can be used to enhance our liposuction results,&quot; says Dr. Singer.  &quot;It's certainly not going to do what liposuction does, but I think those irregularities in post - operative lumps and bumps that we seen can be smoothed out with this.  Its also gives the patient something to do -- to massage it in or have as massage therapist massage it in -- as they're healing.  I think it enhances the healing of liposuction and improves our results.  For plastic surgeons, I think this cream definitely has a place.&quot;<br>



<li>Dr. Bray also notes that while some have voiced concern over the use of a drug in the cream, many cosmetic products use over-the -counter drugs or their roots to accomplish different ends on the external surface of the body than the purposes for which they are used internally.<br>



&quot;You take more of that drug in one day as an asthmatic than you could get through your skin if you put it all over you!&quot; Dr. Bray added.<br>



<li>Some have also speculated that rather than releasing fat from the thighs, the cream simply releases water retained in the thighs.

<li>&quot;I've heard that suggestion since we published our data,&quot; Dr. Bray admits.  &quot;I have no evidence that that's not the case because the rationale for the studies was not based on fluid shifts.  There may well be some fluid shift as part of it.&quot;<br>

<li>The researchers have no further studies planned.  Instead, they have licensed the formula to three cosmetic companies:  The Right Solution in Newport Beach, Calif., which markets it as a Cellution; Nutri/System in Philadelphia (owned by Chicago's Heico Cosmetics, Inc.) which markets it as smooth contours (TM) Thigh Cream; and Herbalife in Los Angeles which produces a slightly altered version of the cream known as Thermojectics Body Toning Cream.  Another company which Dr. Bray says "pirated" the basis of his cream, has its own version of an aminophylline-based thigh cream on the market -- Neways in Salem, Utah, markets Skinny Dip.  Neways has done perhaps the most aggressive marketing campaign of any of the thigh cream producing companies since late last year.<br>

<li>Collette McCollough, a spokesperson for Neways, says the timing of Neway's recent addition of aminophylline to Skinny dip was simply an unfortunate coincidence.<br>



<li>&quot;We benefited form research going on all over the world,&quot; she says.  &quot;Skinny Dip had used theopylline. 'Hard Copy' (a syndicated TV featured news program) came out with a study on aminophylline and we were adding it to our product and the UCLA study came out -- all at the same time; it was all really close.&quot;<br>

<li>The publicity over the Dr. Frome - spearheaded study, though it documented the results of a different cream, certainly didn't hurt Neways.<p>



<h3>Adding aminophylline and sales</h3>

<li>&quot;Our sales completely skyrocketed,&quot; McCollough says, noting that &quot;since we added aminophylline, the results of using Skinny Dip have improved.&quot;<br>

<li>&quot;I've been using Skinny Dip for years, but since the publicity came out everybody's been calling me about it,&quot; reports Dr. Singer, who has used the cream with positive results on 40-50 patients.  &quot;Since they added in the aminophylline, I think it works faster.  You can enhance the results by adding heat or using it in an enclosed environment like an exercise or sauna suit.  By adding the heat you improve the results.  But it's not permanent result.  You stop using the cream and you go back to where you were before.  It's not something that is effecting a permanent change in the same way that liposuction does.  I look it as fitness for the fatty tissue in the external parts of the body -- a fat fitness cream.&quot;<br>



<li>But while some surgeons have used various thigh creams with good results, currently the studies Drs. Frome, Bray and Greenway are the only scientific investigation with available results of the cream's effects.  More studies have been begun by various independent researchers since late last year, but Dr. Bray isn't one of them.<br>

<li>&quot;I haven't done further studies,&quot; explains Dr. Bray, &quot;because once or formula was patented, I have the view that I have a conflict of interest with it.  This actual last study was part of one we were doing to try to get somebody interested.  We published to papers in '87 and '88 and we'd been to a dozen companies but nobody was interested in the formula.  So after awhile, Dr. Frome went into business with us and said he'd try to get it moving along.  So the recent study with him was actually to verify the effect of a lower percentage of aminophylline.&quot;<br>



<h3>FDA certification process underway</h3>

<li>Smooth Contours, Dr. Frome's company which owns the rights to the cream, is currently beginning the process of sending a higher strength cream to the Food and Drug Administration for certification as a medicinal product.  But both FDA and the Federal Trade Commission have begun to look closely at the non-approved &quot;cosmetic&quot; versions of the thigh-smoothing creams.<br>

<li>Alan Halper, of the FDA Office of Cosmtics and Colors, says that so far, no one has submitted any &quot;magic thigh creams&quot; for approval to his department.<br>

<li>&quot;Products promoted to remove cellulite are considered drugs by the agency -- or at least by me,&quot; say Halper.  &quot;I don't consider them cosmetics.  If they are making claims that a product removes dimpled skin or cellulite, then if fits the definition of a drug from the standpoint of 'intending to effect the structure or function of the body of a man or animal.'  So it would be regulated as a drug by the agency.&quot;

<li>Halper says the FDA hasn't reached a decision on what to do about the creams currently on the market, but the FTC has tried to stop some companies from advertising that their creams &quot;break down or reduce cellulite or fat&quot; unless they have firm documentation to prove the claim.  The solution for most companies is simply not to make the claim.<br>



<li>This has been the thrust of The Right Solution's campaign for Cellution.  Brenda Fabian, a spokesperson for the company notes: &quot;It's a topical product.  You can't make claims that it takes fat away because it's sold as a cosmetic.  But the proof is in the pudding.  Every woman in America will be looking for it.&quot;<br>



<h3>FTC - instigates cases against mfrs.</h3>

<li>Susan Cohn, in the FTC's department of advertising practices, says there have been FTC - instigated cases against thigh cream manufacturers, but since they are brought by regional offices, there is no accurate count of the number of such cases.<br>

<li>&quot;There are lots of different creams out there with different ingredients,&quot; Cohn says.  &quot;Some companies have been making claims for these products for a number of years.  When somebody makes a claim that a product will behave in a certain way and give you certain results, they  have to have adequate substantiation for that claim before they can disseminate it  They are allowed to say anything that's truthful and not misleading.  AT this point I don't know if they do or do not have substantiation.&quot;<br>

<li>Ralph Bashioum, MD, a Minneapolis ASPRS member who was recently interviewed for a TV news report on thigh slimming creams, voices the feelings of many who have heard about the creams and wondered if they had any value.<br>

<li>&quot;The study that has been done doesn't show the cream is actually absorbed in the skin, and it's the only study that's ever been done on this, notes Dr. Bashioum.  &quot;I think it warrants further investigation with a significant amount of patients to demonstrate whether this is beneficial or not beneficial.&quot;
