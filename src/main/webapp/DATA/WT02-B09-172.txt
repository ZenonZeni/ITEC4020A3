<h1><font SIZE=+4>Legalize marijuana for medicinal uses </font></h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>With recent raids in San Francisco, law enforcement officials
have declared war on marijuana clubs. However, the war they have declared
is not on drug dealers and criminals, but on terminally ill patients who
use the substance as medicine.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 on the November ballot would take the
medicinal use of marijuana out of the confusing gray zone that allows the
political and criminal exploitation of sick people. The proposition would
allow seriously and terminally ill patients to use marijuana as a medical
treatment. Patients with a doctor's approval would be exempt from the state's
criminal marijuana laws. We support Proposition 215 as a human measure
that clearly delineates medicinal and recreational use of the substance.</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Patients suffering from cancer, glaucoma, arthritis, AIDS
and other debilitating illnesses have found relief from their pain when
they smoke marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 protects patients and doctors who currently
risk criminal prosecution for using, cultivating or prescribing the use
of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Currently, there is no legal way for patients to get the
substance. They are forced to break the law to get relief.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The medicinal use of marijuana has received bipartisan
support in the state. In 1994 and 1995, both houses of the Legislature
passed bills allowing patients to use the substance as a medicine. The
bills were vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>If opponents are concerned the proposition would make
recreational use of marijuana easier, they can stop worrying. Proposition
215 is even more narrowly defined than previous bills, focused only on
patients and their use of the substance.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In fact, other states have already taken this compassionate
step. In Florida, the state legislature recognized the medicinal value
of marijuana; the state Supreme Court there ruled that patients should
not be jailed for its use. Last year, Ohio created a special exemption
from marijuana laws for patients using the substance under a doctor's order.</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 is a compassionate measure that will allow
seriously and terminally ill patients to find some relief from their pain-under
a doctor's order. It does not promote drug use or weaken the laws prohibiting
it. Patients sick enough to need the substance should not have the additional
worry of being arrested or investigated by law enforcement.</font></p>
