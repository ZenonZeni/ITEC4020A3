<H2><I>B. </I>New Vehicle Technologies are Ushering In an Era of More 
Efficient Transportation</H2>
<P>

<H3>1. Technology Incentives Spur Markets For Efficient Vehicles</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Faced with increasing vehicle emissions and the prospect of failing to 
attain federal Clean Air Act standards, several U.S. jurisdictions are 
implementing policies that require greater vehicle efficiency. <P>
<p>     <B><I>The California Air Resources Board. </B></I>The California 
Air Resources Board (CARB) has galvanized a low-emission vehicle (LEV) and 
zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) market in California by requiring automobile 
manufacturers to include at least 2 percent zero emission vehicles in 
their 1998 vehicle sales (an estimated 31,000 vehicles). Sales must rise 
to 5 percent by the year 2001 and 10 percent in 2003.<a href="#274" name="r274"> [ 274 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      <BR>
The level of overall ZEV investment, in both human and financial terms, 
has been remarkable, reaching as high as $500 million by some estimates. 
The California ZEV program has the capacity to create a trillion-dollar 
industry of environmentally clean transportation products that will create 
millions of jobs and investment opportunities in the United States and 
around the world. The California ZEV mandate has been embraced by Vermont, 
Massachusetts, and New York, and is being seriously considered by a number 
of other states.<a href="#275" name="r275"> [ 275 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="274"  HREF="#r274">274.</a> Companies subject to the ZEV requirements are "major" automakers 
selling more than 35,000 vehicles per year in California. The companies 
include General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Chrysler, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda. 
In 2003, the threshold will drop to 3,000 sales per year, which will 
affect most European companies and smaller Japanese companies. Sperling, 
D., <I>Future Drive: Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation</I>, 
pp. 38-39 (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1995).<p>     An important lure 
for all these companies is the ability to sell ZEV credits. For each 
vehicle sold, the California Air Resources Board will provide the company 
with a ZEV credit. Credits can be sold t<BR>
o any of the Big Seven manufacturers. Because the fine for not selling a 
ZEV is $5,000, and the loss per vehicle is expected to be greater than 
$5,000 per vehicle initially, the Big Seven should be willing to pay up to 
$5,000 for each vehicle credit. The trading of ZEV credits could be 
attractive to all concerned. It allows a company such as General Motors to 
meet part (or all) of its ZEV responsibilities without paying an 
embarrassing fine and without incurring large losses. And it provides 
small, cash-strapped electric vehicle companies with a substantial cash 
subsidy for every vehicle sold, even small neighborhood electric cars.
