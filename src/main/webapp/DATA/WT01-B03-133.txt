<h1><a href="April_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="U.S. Dollar Index "><b>U.S. Dollar Index</b> </a></h1>

<p><img src="../images/April_1.gif" width="612" height="471"> </p>

<p>Back in our July issue we said &#147;<i>The Dollar is now at
the low end of it's range and we expect a rebound over the next
few months</i>&#148;. As we can see from the attached chart,
almost from that moment our prediction began materializing.
During the following six weeks the dollar rose from 81 (point A)
to 87.05 (point B). In the following month our lead article
discussed how to profit from currency fluctuations. </p>

<p>In that article I said that the Dollar has been in a primary
downtrend for the last ten years but was in the process of taking
a temporary break to the upside. Betting against the dollar in
favor of the Mark, Yen and Swiss Franc in the long term is
generally a safe bet. But in the short run we were due for a
correction. </p>

<p>In our September Issue I showed you the Multi-currency
sandwich in which you buy one currency and sell (short) another.
That is exactly what the &#147;Big Boys&#148; did in August. They
borrowed Yen and bought U.S. Treasury Notes. This is exactly what
caused the rapid rise of the Dollar and put a cap on the price of
Yen. </p>

<p>The reason I am recounting all this again is because of its
effect on our current situation. We must remember that we are now
in a very integrated global market where actions in Japan often
affect how markets in New York react. The &#147;Big Boys&#148;
were short Yen and Long Treasuries. At some point they had to
cover their shorts (preferably before the Yen rose). This is
exactly what has been happening over the last few months! This
has pulled Billions of Dollars from the US T-Bond market and put
it back into Yen. </p>

<p>The effect of this overhead selling pressure is that whenever
T-Bonds showed any signs of strength it was pushed back down
again. So even though our positions in Bonds should have
theoretically been profitable, the currency market has been
robbing our profits. </p>

<p>As we can see from the chart, Points &#147;B&#148; and
&#147;C&#148; corresponded with over-bought conditions on the
Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Dollar dropped shortly
thereafter. We are currently at point &#147;D&#148; and are once
again overbought and expecting a short term drop in the Dollar.
If it crosses through its support line we can expect it to resume
its 10 year downtrend. But we may see another bounce off its
support line and another testing of its upper resistance line. </p>

<p>The peaks appear to have an approximately two month cycle and
the support and resistance are converging so we should be trading
in a relatively narrow range until we get a breakout in one
direction or the other. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Microsoft Update</h2>

<p><img src="../images/April_2.gif" width="455" height="311"> </p>

<p>In our August issue I said that I expected Windows95 to be
very profitable for Microsoft and that it would trade above its
highs of 110. At the time it was trading in the low 90's with a
P/E of over 40. (P/E is price divided by earnings&#151;a measure
of the value of each share. Low P/E's, &lt;10, are generally
considered a bargain.) As of this writing it is trading around
113 with a P/E of 35.9. The P/E dropped primarily due to the
increase in earnings from Windows95! Had you purchased MSFT at
that recommendation and held it until now you would be up about
21 ½ % in 8 months! </p>

<p>In our December issue we covered the cyclical nature of
Microsoft suggesting that you could buy it on dips to the 90
range and sell around 100. Since December there has only been one
such dip which could have yielded you better than 10% in 6 weeks! </p>

<p>Microsoft is still acting cyclically, although in a higher
range, but is nearing the top of an eight week cycle so caution
is advised. </p>

<p><i>Note: 16 week peaks are marked with an arrow, eight week
peaks are marked with an &#147;8&#148;.</i> </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Gold Bond Ratio</h2>

<p><img src="../images/April_3.gif" alt="Gold vs Bond Ratio"
width="509" height="293"> </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) </h2>

<p>The MIP is showing only a slight incline through June although
the investment press has begun zeroing in on inflation as the
next big news. The current increase in the price of Grains and
Oil has caught their attention <b>although Gold has been down
significantly.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;There is still quite a bit of evidence that long term
interest rates are still too high but our MIP is showing signs of
inflation on the horizon. It is very possible that <b>both</b>
Bonds and Gold will begin to rise in the short term. If the Fed
cuts interest rates again to bring Long Term Rates in line, Bonds
may benefit while at the same time grain and commodity prices
including oil are putting upward pressure on inflation. </p>

<p>This is a perfect example of where we need to watch our Bond
vs. Gold Ratio very carefully. Lately we have had several
downward breaks through the moving average which is typical of a
ratio that is relatively flat (usually at turning points). So we
may continue to see alternating crossings through the average
until a trend in one direction or the other materializes. </p>

<p>At this point Bonds have crossed the four week moving average
again and has bounc the eight week average. An 8 week crossing is
much less likely to get &#147;whipsawed&#148;. <b><i>Theoretically,
Bonds should out perform Gold for the next few months but we need
to keep one eye on the ratio and the other on the exits.</i></b> </p>

<p><img src="../images/April_4.gif" alt="MIP 4/96" width="455"
height="311"> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since February the following commodities are basically flat (<i>i.e.,</i>
although they have been volatile they have gone nowhere) Lumber,
Cotton, Cocoa, Broilers, Coffee, Milk, and Sugar. These basic
staples among others have not shown signs of inflation yet and
Eggs are down as much as Gold. </p>

<p>Gold and the previously mentioned commodities peaked in
February so we must be careful listening to the establishment
press. Oil and Grains may be signaling the coming increase but
the MIP is telling us the real inflation is not in store until
the second half of 1996 and the Gold/Bond ratio chart is saying
that for the short term Bonds should out perform Gold. Probably
when the press decides there was nothing to the rally it will
begin in earnest. </p>

width="568" height="376"></p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Benham 2020 (RSI)</h2>

<p><img src="../images/April_7.gif" alt="Benham 2020 RSI"
width="570" height="476"></p>

<p>At this point Bonds are still in the oversold range on the
Relative Strength chart (but rising) so we are still expecting a
rise into the overbought side before a reversal. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Benham Gold (RSI)</h2>

<p><img src="../images/April_6.gif" alt="Benham Gold RSI"
width="592" height="479"></p>

<p>Gold, however, is also entering the oversold side setting
itself up for a potential rise before too long. </p>

<p>Gold ought to approach the extremely oversold line before we
consider another buy signal. So here we have Bond's strength
rising and Gold's strength falling in typical opposite pair
fashion. We want to continue holding Bonds until that situation
reverses. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>NYSE INDEX (RSI)</h2>

<p><img src="../images/April_8.gif" alt="NYSE RSI" width="604"
height="475"> </p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index made one dip into oversold
territory as a result of the almost 2.9% drop earlier this month.
This could be considered the drop we were expecting and a buy
signal but the overall pattern suggests that we might be in for
another dip. If so it should take the RSI below the extremely
oversold line. </p>

<p>If we are in for inflation later this year, it will probably
bring higher interest rates and pull some capital from the Stock
Market. </p>

<p>There are still opportunities in select situations but caution
is advised. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Platinum / Gold Ratio</h2>

<p><img src="../images/April_9.gif" alt="Platinum vs Gold Ratio"
width="455" height="311"></p>

<p>The Platinum Gold Ratio is still showing Platinum undervalued
in relation to Gold even with the recent drop in the price of
Gold. </p>
