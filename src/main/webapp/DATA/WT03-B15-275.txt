<H3>Robo Doc - One Hospital’s Outreach Program</H3> 



<P>

<STRONG>Challenge:</STRONG> A hospital located in a rural county noted that local children were at a disturbingly high risk of tobacco, alcohol and other drug use. Area children also showed poor nutritional awareness. School budgets were limited and educational efforts were further hindered by the fact that this was a tri-racial county (black, white and American Indian). No special health programs were equally acceptable to all groups.





<P>

The hospital and its doctors wanted to promote preventive health awareness to county children and their parents. As the most successful hospital in the county, the client also wanted to improve its image of service in the neighboring rural communities.



<P>

<STRONG>Experience:</STRONG> After considering a number of options, the hospital decided to fund installation of the <A HREF="../working.htm">Million Dollar Machine</A> <!--link to MDM page--> curriculum for every elementary student in the county.  The robotic instructor generated terrific excitement in the rural area and became an instant local celebrity. Best of all, the robot teacher was equally loved by each of the three cultural groups. In addition to school programs, the hospital also had their robotic representative appear at other community functions and at the hospital itself.



<P>

<STRONG>Result:</STRONG> Television crews and reporters came from a 100 mile radius to cover the hospital’s events.  While hospitals make their money treating illness by necessity, many reporters praised this one for teaching people to avoid sickness and stay healthy.  The county Sheriff’s Department, parent’s groups and civic organizations volunteered their time to support the hospital’s effort.  Evening health education classes for parents at the hospital were well attended by parents and interested citizens.  County middle school students even petitioned the hospital to provide the program to them, a request that the hospital gladly granted.  Based on the success of the first campaign, the hospital conducted the entire county-wide program a second time four years later. 



<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> In 1995, GoWell & Kent developed a special healing skills curriculum for children in health care facilities nationwide.  We invite you to visit our <A HREF="../working.htm">Super Power Tour</A> <!-- link to SPT--> page to find out more.
