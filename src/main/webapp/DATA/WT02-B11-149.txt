I'll try to sketch the problem that I came across with the information<br>
given in Hal Finney's description of How double-spending is prevented<br>
in off-line anonymous e-money schemes.<br>
<p>
The main idea is that each piece of cash carries some &lt;info&gt; belonging<br>
to the person who originally withdrew it. Now, A being the original<br>
withdrawer, if A double-spends the cash (say x^d) to both B and C then<br>
combining the information that B and C got from the cash itself (at the<br>
time B and C both sent this info to the bank) reveals out the &lt;info&gt;<br>
that was embedded in the cash. Since this &lt;info&gt; belongs to A, who is<br>
the double-spender, you've identified the true person.<br>
<p>
Now, consider the case that A spent x^d to B. Remeber that B cannot play<br>
with the contents of x since it's signed by the bank. Thus, if B wants to spend<br>
x he will spend it exactly as it is, B has no way of putting his own &lt;info&gt;<br>
into x. Furthermore, B wouldn't like to put his &lt;info&gt; into x even if he could<br>
if he has the intention of double-spending it.<br>
<p>
Consider B double-spent x to C and D. Then C and D extracted their parts of<br>
information embedded in x and sent to the bank. Now, the bank can reveal<br>
out the &lt;info&gt; which belongs to the original withdrawer of x, namely A, but<br>
A is not the double-spender. Thus, B got away with the much that he bought<br>
upto the time bank detected the double-spending, and still he didn't face<br>
any serious problems that would jeopardize his anonimity.<br>
<p>
There should be more behind the mechanism told in the paper that I got<br>
this information from. Otherwise, there is no off-line anonymous e-money.<br>
<p>
I would like to hear your comments about this problem, or any extra information<br>
that could help us convince ourselves, atleast technically, that one piece of <br>
ecash can be spent over and over again without the need to deposit each piece<br>
of cash that we receive, and get brand-new ones with new serial numbers.<br>
