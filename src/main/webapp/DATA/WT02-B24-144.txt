<h4>Making School-Based Management Succeed</h4>

<p>What, then, is necessary for school-based management to succeed? What
must be in place?
<ul>
   <li>Central administrators must accept change and not be allowed to sabotage. 
Conflicts in some districts have been resolved by a school-based management 
director who answers directly to the superintendent.
   <li>Members of the school-based management councils must be trained in the 
skills of consensus-building, avoiding resistance, and successful guidance 
(see also Glickman, 1992).
   <li>Principals and management councils must be allowed freedom and time even if 
they make mistakes.
   <li>Where unions and labor contracts place restrictions on principals, 
personnel issues such as hiring, dismissal, or different treatment across 
the system must be resolved.
   <li>The role of central administration must be defined. Principals may be 
accountable for test scores, evaluated by parent, teachers, or student 
surveys, and supervised by line position staff (Neal, 1989).
   <li>Members of the management team must be held accountable for their decisions 
as a group.
   <li>There must be an efficient system for communicating and sharing information 
with shareholders (David, 1994).
   <li>Members of the council must constantly be reminded that their purpose is to 
improve student learning. Instructional improvement is the standard against 
which each decision made by a school-based management council must be 
measured.
   <li>School-based management should be part of broader systemic strategies for 
improving teaching and learning (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
   <li>An information system must be developed to support school-based management 
(Bradley and Olson, 1993).
   <li>Performance of the school-based management council must be constantly 
evaluated.
</ul>
<p>Newmann (1993) identified six valued outcomes against which proposals and 
programs can be evaluated: 
<ul>
   <li><b>Authentic student achievement</b> - what kind of achievement should be
valued?
     <dl>
     <dd><i>Conventional achievement</i> - learning, reproducing specific definitions,
facts, skills<br>
     <dd><i>Authentic achievement</i> - use mind to produce discourse, material
objects, performance tasks with personal. aesthetic, utilitarian value
<br>
     <dd>Problem:Critics claim conventional achievement dominates formal 
educational system and stifles student engagement in learning, suppresses critical and
creative thinking, and minimizes application of school learning to life.
<br>
     </dl>
   <li><b>Equity</b> - to the extent educational opportunities are determined by race, 
social class, gender, cultural background, the system violates the 
democratic principle of equal educational opportunity <br>

   <li><b>Empowerment</b><br> 
        Prominent theme - new decision-making structures raise complex issues of 
        score and authority; increased empowerment
        <br>
        <br>
        Increased empowerment of teachers brings increased responsibilities, 
        school curriculum, hiring, budget, interactions with parents 
        <br>
      
   <li><b>Communities of learning</b>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd> Research suggests society would benefit from efforts to transform 
impersonal, fragmented bureaucratic organizations (such as schools) into 
places where participants share common goals, pursue common agenda of 
activities though collaboration
<br>
<dd>In communities of learning
    <br> 
    Teachers and students relate to each other as whole persons
    <br>
    <br>
    Teachers and students participate in, take responsibility for 
    collective life of the school
    <br>
    <br>
    Three social forces that work against communities of learning include:
<ul>
<li>cultural differentials related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, 
and urbanicity
<li>professionalism
<li>cultural value attached to individual autonomy as most important 
criterion for quality of life 
</ul>
</dl>

<ul>
   <li><b>Reflective dialogue</b>
   <dl>
     <dt>&quot;Belief systems cannot be changed by unilateral imposition or by the 
         simple replacement of an old belief with a new one.&quot; Beliefs change - 
         dialogue stimulating opening questioning, testing of basic assumptions 
         through new experiences
     <br>
     <dt>Reflective dialogue allows teachers, administrators, policy makers, and 
         parents to make decisions about optimal educational practice through 
         study and discussion.
     <br>
     <dt>Reflective dialogue requires access to knowledge.
     <br>
  </dl>
<li><b>Accountability</b>
   <dl>
     <dt>Rather than controlling and regulating the process of education (such as 
         course credits, curriculum content, staffing ratios) schools will be 
         held more accountable for student learning.<br>
     <dt>Accountability means assessment must be gathered whose indicators can be 
         compared across classrooms, schools, and districts.
     <br>       
     <dt>Accountability must make assessment data accessible to the public.
     <br>
     <dt>Allocation of positive, negative consequences for student performance
     <br>
     <dt><em>Issues</em> - what standards should be used to evaluate student
         performance; this is particularly problematic if the point of accountability is to 
         enable the public to compare schools.
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
Cole (1992) wrote that in order to have successful school-based management, 
districts must be ready in terms of support and flexibility. Cole offered 
these questions to measure the readiness of a district with regard to support, 
flexibility:
<ul>
  <li>Are policies, programs, and people sufficiently flexible to ensure the 
capacity to respond to changing conditions?
  <li>Do contracts, board policies, and state laws and regulations permit 
flexible use of time, people, space, knowledge, technology, and physical 
support?

  <li>Are time, people, space, knowledge, technology, and physical support 
assigned in a manner that is responsive to the needs of those with 
responsibility to carry out tasks?
  <li>Do those who carry out tasks for the district feel supported by district 
leaders and by the resources of the district?
</ul>
<p>
Cole (1992) identifies <b>time, people, space, knowledge, technology</b> and <b>physical 
support</b> as six key elements that combine to create the chemistry of a school, 
the building blocks of innovation and improvement. Redefining schools requires 
rethinking of deeply held assumptions about the use of space and time in 
school, for example. Before a new calendar can be adopted must come 
recognition that the use of time is something that can be changed. Before 
change, however, must come a change in vision.
<p>
Cole (1993) states that a shared vision ensures commitment to change and to 
improve; it prevents reform from being a &quot;revolving door.&quot; Visions that 
provide direction must be grounded in a thoroughly articulated set of beliefs 
about the purpose of schools; the ability of students to learn; the factors 
that determine the opportunity to learn; the roles of the family and community 
in relation to students and schools; the kind of society for which children 
are being prepared; the proper focus of school activity; the rules, roles, 
relationships that govern behavior within schools, between schools, and the 
district office, between schools and community; the obligation of the system 
to employees; and the role of the system in encouraging and supporting 
innovation. Cole (1993) said, &quot;A vision of schooling taken for granted and 
thus unshared is not a vision that has the power to compel change.&quot;
<p>
If lasting change is to occur, Cole (1993) states the following questions must 
be asked and answered regularly:
<ul>
  <li>What is the purpose of the school?
  <li>Who are the school's clients, and what are their needs? 
  <li>How well does the school meet its clients' needs?
</ul>
<p>
How, then, does a school-based management council or team begin? Most of the 
articles published on school-based management chronicle what not to do in 
order to be successful. One excellent manual for training facilitators to 
develop and implement school-based management was compiled by James Mitchell, 
superintendent of Adams Twelve Five Star Schools in Colorado(1990).
<p>
Mitchell (1990) suggests that each council meeting begin with a team-building 
activity. Such activities allow members an opportunity to express anxieties, 
establish verbal territory (get contributions going, avoid one person 
domination), begin group bonding and acceptance, and allow practice in 
listening with respect to no side conversations, no walking out, no judgments, 
etc.
<p>
Management teams usually have members with a wide variety of personalities, 
backgrounds, talents, and skills (Mitchell, 1990). Team members have different 
knowledge, motivation, and enthusiasm levels. Each team members comes with an 
agenda peculiar to that individual member.
<p>
There are a number of ways teams may problem-solve together (See Appendix, 
Soffer, 1992). One method utilized for problem-solving by school-based 
management teams is brainstorming. Basic rules which encourage successful 
brainstorming (Mitchell, 1990) include the following:
<ul>
  <li>No criticism. Participants may make no negative comments about any 
contributions.
  <li>All contributions should be listed as stated. Write contributions on a 
chalkboard, flip chart, etc. using a scribe.
  <li>Encourage all team members to contribute.
  <li>Encourage team members to modify ideas suggested to make a new idea or 
combine two or more ideas into another possibility.
  <li>Continue the process until no further contributions are generated.
  <li>Ask the participant who suggested it to clarify any contributions which 
are unclear.
  <li>Contributions may be categorized to assist in clarification.
  <li>If the team has been divided into small groups, allow each group to report 
back to the larger group. Avoid repeating contributions already listed.
  <li>Record contributions made.
</ul>
<p>
Consensus must then be developed. Mitchell (1990) suggests a rather unique 
method to determine if consensus is being reached. He uses a &quot;straw vote&quot; 
procedure which utilizes a show of fingers. Five fingers indicate &quot;Total 
agreement, best solution, complete support,&quot; four fingers indicate &quot;Agreement, 
support, good solution,&quot; three fingers indicate &quot;Willing to support,&quot; two 
fingers indicate &quot;Don't agree, won't support, won't sabotage,&quot; and one finger 
indicates &quot;Will sabotage.&quot;
<p>
One important point which Mitchell (1990) makes is that every organization, 
including schools, has twenty percent who are &quot;blockers.&quot; Blockers can be 
promised double salary, pay for staying home, and other enticements, but they 
will still balk at innovation or change. Because it is extremely difficult to 
get everyone to agree, Mitchell recommends going ahead with seventy to eighty 
percent agreement which he calls &quot;<b>sufficient consensus</b>&quot;.
<p>
At our school we make a conscious effort to get &quot;buy in.&quot; If eighty percent of 
the staff, parents, or community members will &quot;buy in&quot; by giving a proposal
a &quot;six on a scale of ten,&quot; and will <b>agree not to block </b>decisions made by the 
group, we will move forward. While this system acknowledges that some will 
disagree, it values all opinions and has allowed our management team to 
maintain forward thrust.
<p>
Mitchell (1990) notes that in his district, principals do not have power to 
veto the school-based management team. Principals are part of the 
decision-making committee; if they veto, they destroy the process. The group, 
in turn, should be held responsible for a decision.
<p>
According to Mitchell (1990) any planned change should include a plan for 
managing it. School-based decisions can be managed by educating the masses 
(good old fashioned communication to the shareholders), receiving a commitment 
to the decision from the central office, generating union support/evaluation, 
beginning facilitation/team building training, and by providing a support 
system.
<p>
If a school based management team is not working, members should try to 
ascertain the cause (Mitchell, 1990). School-based decision making is hampered 
by misinformation, poor communication, uncertainty that the product is what is 
wanted, an inappropriate purpose for the request, lip service with no follow-
through, lack of support, and no input into the decision-making process, 
&quot;them&quot; vs &quot;us&quot; attitude between parents and principals or parents
and teachers, principal mistrust, lack of central office commitment, 
inconsistency, lack of parameter to define what the team can/cannot do. and no 
support to eliminate incompetent personnel. 
<p>
Mitchell (1990) has also identified blocks to school-based management - 
deadlines, regurgitation of the same information already available through 
technology, lack of response, too much communication, turf wars, innovation 
overload, hidden agenda of individual members, and changes implemented without 
adequate communication.
<p>
Mitchell (1990) warns that it is essential for any group representing a larger 
group to go back to the larger group prior to speaking for them. Such lack of 
feedback gives rise to criticisms of &quot;elitism,&quot; a criticism which can 
effectively kill school-based management. 
</p>
<h4>What can I  do for my learning disabled child in a school with school-based
management?</h4>
<p>
What then is the role of the parents of students with learning disabilities in 
school-based management? What can a parent hope to accomplish for their 
children in the school-based management process? 
<p>
First, the parent must become absolutely knowledgeable about what is happening 
at the school. Make sure you are receiving copies of all written 
communications from the school. If your child has an organization problem, do 
not assume that all written communications are coming to you. Request that 
communications be <b>mailed</b> to you. You may be more successful in this request if 
you take stamps to the school or even self-addressed, stamped envelopes.
Once you learn what is happening in your own school, become involved with 
meetings. Attend meetings of the largest parent group at your school, either 
the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), 
booster club, or whatever. Usually school-based management team members are 
selected by the largest parent body at the school, although membership in the 
group is not usually a prerequisite for election.
<p>
Attend meetings of the management team. Most schools publish at least the 
meeting time and place for all such team meetings. Our school publishes a 
newsletter giving the minutes of the previous meeting as well as the agenda 
for the coming meeting, the date, place, and time of day of the meeting. If 
this is not being done, request it from whatever entity communicates by 
newsletter from the school.
<p>
Once you are familiar with what is happening at your own school, begin to pay 
close attention to the kinds of shareholders who make up the council or team. 
Are the members only teachers? Are parents members? Are there subcommittees or 
other councils? Who makes up the membership? How and when are members 
selected?
<p>
Does the management team make recommendations for courses? If so, what 
provisions are made for students with learning disabilities? Are all students 
with learning disabilities mainstreamed? Are there resource classes? What 
subjects are taught utilizing special education teachers?
<p>
You may want to become a member of your school-based management team. If you 
learn, for example, that none of the students with learning disabilities are 
being taught in special education classes with qualified, trained teachers, 
you may want to gather information for the council or team in terms of what 
research indicates students with disabilities need. Consult authors such as 
James Kauffman (<em>Exceptional Children</em>, September 1993), the Learning 
Disabilities Association of America position paper on <em>Inclusion</em>, February, 
1993, and Reid Lyon (&quot;Inclusion: Can it work for students with learning 
disabilities,&quot; National Institutes of Health, 1994). You may want to get 
copies of articles or pamphlets to share with members of your school council 
or team.
<p>
What about transition services at your school for students with learning 
disabilities? Who is responsible for transition planning? When must transition 
planning be done? What data are brought to transition planning meetings? With 
what agencies does the school work to ensure smooth transitions from school? 
Questions such as these may be answered by the principal, school counselor, 
vocational counselor, special education counselor (if any), vocational teacher 
or supervisor, special education supervisor or even special education 
director.
<p>
Once you know what is being done, begin to formulate ways to improve the 
situation. Meet with other parents of students with disabilities - do they 
have problems? What has happened to their children? What should happen but is 
not being done? Certainly a local LDA affiliate is a place to begin to contact 
parents representative of your school.
<p>
If you find that little or nothing is being done toward easing the transition 
from school to work or post secondary education, articulate with other parents 
what is needed. Make written recommendations to the school-based management 
council with details as to strategies, resources needed, time lines, etc. 
Brainstorming is an excellent process for defining such recommendations. Ask 
your group how transition should look if it were to meet the needs of all 
students with learning disabilities. What barriers currently exist to the 
ideal? How can these barriers be broken or overcome? What resources are needed 
to effect a positive change?
<p>
It is important at the high school level to think of what comes next for 
students. Students graduating from high school have essentially two options - 
go to post secondary educational settings, colleges or universities, or enter 
the world of work. What skills or knowledge must a student have to be 
successful at either? What is currently in place in the curriculum, accessible 
to the student with learning disabilities, that would prepare him/her for post 
secondary education or for employment? If there is none, there must be a 
beginning.
<p>
If, as in Texas, so-called &quot;basic classes&quot; have been discontinued at the high 
school level, then the curriculum formerly taught in those classes must be 
available in other settings, i.e. resource rooms, for students with learning 
disabilities. If a student is unable to master algebra, is there a course 
where pre-algebra will be taught to mastery? Is algebra the &quot;gate-keeper&quot; 
course at your high school through which Students must pass if they are to go 
on to post secondary education? Can students with disabilities pass algebra at 
your high school?
<p>
The school-based decision making team is a mechanism which can effect changes 
in time, scheduling, tracking, course curricula, assessments, etc. Accessing 
the system requires information, both of the management team and of the 
current system. Creating change requires a vision of how the ideal looks -- 
how will you know you have what is needed in order to facilitate your child's 
entering college successfully or acquiring vocational skills to get at least a 
beginning-level job? How can you translate that vision so it will be shared by 
other members of the school-based management team?
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
School-based management councils or teams are apparently an accepted, integral 
part of the reform movement in the United States. Whether the needs of 
students with learning disabilities are being met in our educational 
institutions depends on knowledge and interest of shareholders and 
participants. Parents must become informed -- they must learn to access the 
system, to share the power, to be a part of the solution if reform is to 
equate to change and improvement in the system for the learning disabled.
Members of our school-based management teams have at one time or another 
included parents of students with disabilities being served in regular class, 
resource, or other instructional arrangements. In almost every instance, these 
parents have informed the larger group about what is needed in order for 
theirs and similar children to successfully participate in learning. Our 
school-based management teams have decided upon the physical location of 
classes for students with disabilities, sought and provided accessibility to 
classrooms and other areas of the school, and even facilitated inclusion of 
students with disabilities in field trips and extracurricular activities. Your 
willingness to work, to share, and to be a responsible part of the 
decision-making team at your school could well be the difference between 
success or failure, not only of your child but also other students with 
disabilities.
