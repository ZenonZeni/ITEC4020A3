<H2><CENTER>Statement Against California Marijuana Initiative 1996</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
It is not compassionate, and should never be legal, to provide a harmful
addictive drug which<BR>
has never been scientifically proven safe or effective as required by Federal
consumer<BR>
protection laws.<BR>
<BR>
This initiative creates a giant loophole to grow and deal marijuana, endangering
the health and<BR>
safety of all, and it puts California in conflict with Federal law.  This
initiative falsely implies<BR>
that marijuana cigarettes alleviate disease; however, there is no scientific
proof that marijuana<BR>
is safe or effective for ANY illness.  Its use masks symptoms, discouraging
ill people from<BR>
seeking medical care, often causing them direct harm.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, a US Court of Appeals ruled marijuana remain a Schedule I drug:
highly addictive,<BR>
no medical usefulness.  The court noted that the pro-marijuana physicians
had relied on non-<BR>
scientific evidence.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
THC, marijuana's major ingredient, for limited medical use.  Pure synthetic
THC, marketed as Marinol, is available by prescription in pill form for
treatment of nausea in some cancer chemotherapy patients and as an appetite
stimulant for AIDS Wasting Syndrome.<BR>
<BR>
The FDA has NOT approved crude marijuana, which has more than 425 chemicals
converting to thousands when smoked; many are toxic and cancer-causing.
Smoking is harmful; no medicine is administered by smoking.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>AIDS: </STRONG> Scientific studies indicate marijuana cigarettes
damage the immune system, causing further peril to already weakened immune
systems.  HIV-positive smokers progress to full-blown AIDS twice as fast
as non-smokers and have an increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>CANCER: </STRONG> Marijuana contains many cancer-causing substances;
some are present in higher concentrations in marijuana smoke than in tobacco
smoke.  Studies have linked marijuana to a number of cancers in young marijuana
smokers, including cancer of the mouth, tongue, larynx, jaw, head, neck,
and lungs.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>GLAUCOMA: </STRONG> Marijuana does NOT prevent blindness due to
glaucoma.<BR>
<BR>
Marijuana is harmful to lungs, heart, immunity, and reproduction.  Recent
studies have shown<BR>
numerous abnormalities, including low birthweight, behavioral disorders,
lower IQ, and an<BR>
eleven-fold increase in childhood leukemia in offspring of mothers who smoked
marijuana during pregnancy. Since marijuana impairs mental functioning,
it is a known cause of many motor vehicle and industrial accidents.<BR>
<BR>
Marijuana is currently up to 25 times more potent than it was in the 1960s.
It remains in the bodys fat cells for months. Marijuana is a major cause
of addiction, often requiring rehabilitation/treatment. Research links marijuana
to the use of cocaine and other drugs. The number of young users of marijuana
is rising because of the marijuana as medicine propaganda.<BR>
<BR>
The initiative bypasses laws designed to protect the public from unscrupulous
snake oil salesmen.  With no restrictions or regulations, this initiative
encourages cultivation and use of marijuana, allowing any physician, including
those in the marijuana lobby, to verbally approve marijuana for any condition.
 What has not been made clear to the public is that this initiative will
bypass FDA regulations designed to protect the public.<BR>
<BR>
A leading activist for marijuana legalization said pro legalization advocates
would use &quot;The<BR>
medical model as spearheading a strategy for the legalization of marijuana
by 1997.&quot;  The<BR>
California Marijuana Initiative 1996 is blatant legalization of marijuana;
it is medical quackery<BR>
and makes a mockery of the law.  <BR>
