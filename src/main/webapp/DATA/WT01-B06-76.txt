How Well Should Your Mutual Fund Have Performed </H2><P>
<HR>

Any measurement is useless if the scale is inaccurate. For individual investors, that means carefully selecting the scale used to weigh a mutual fund portfolio manager. To be meaningful, the scale must relate the portfolio's performance to the risk that was undertaken to achieve the return.<p>


Investors often misevaluate professional money managers by focusing solely on return. Sometimes, the entire analysis comes down to:<p>

<UL>
<LI> A loss is bad;
<LI> A positive return is good 
<LI> A double-digit return is terrific;
<LI> Risk is unimportant as long as the return is high 
</UL>


However, risk should be given an equal weight with return when judging manager performance. Over time, every investment carries a certain amount of risk for which investors should demand proportionate compensation.<p>


Since higher risk should mean higher return, the greater the risk undertaken by the portfolio, the higher its return should be--a simple summary of a complex formulation. In addition, your fund's performance should be judged relative to funds with a similar investment objective, which implicitly considers risk.<p>


One evaluation method, taking these risk factors into consideration, is to determine what your fund should have returned based on these three approaches to measuring risk--market risk, total risk and investment objective risk. The calculation is presented in the table below, using an aggressive growth fund as an example.<p>


In these calculations, beta is used as a measure of market risk; it measures how a portfolio's return has behaved relative to the overall market. A beta of 1.00 indicates a portfolio behaves similarly to the market--when the market rises or drops 10%, the portfolio on average rises or drops 10%; a beta of 1.5 indicates more market risk--when the market rises or drops 10%, the portfolio on average rises or drops 15%. <p>


Total risk and investment objective risk are measured using standard deviation, which looks at the total variability of returns over time. The standard deviations of low-load mutual funds are reported in AAII's Quarterly Low-Load Mutual Fund Update newsletter.<p>


The evaluations using all three risk measures compare the risk of the fund against a benchmark. A fund's beta is implicitly a relative ratio, the same as dividing it by the market beta of 1.00. Dividing the fund's standard deviation by the market's standard deviation produces a total risk ratio, which compares the fund's volatility with the market's volatility; dividing the fund's standard deviation by the average standard deviation for its investment objective produces the investment objective risk ratio, which compares the fund's volatility with the volatility for the average fund in its investment objective category.<p>


Once these relative ratios are determined, the equations for evaluating risk and return are the same. The required return states the return the fund should have produced based on its risk; this return is then compared to the fund's actual return, to see how much better--or worse--the fund did than would be expected.<p>


What do the results mean? It depends on the risk measure used. Theoretically, for well-diversified portfolios, the use of these three measures of risk should provide you with similar results. However, in real world situations--no single approach for evaluating the risk and return of a fund may work in all cases.<p>


In our example, the fund did well considering market risk (beta), the amount of total risk it incurred and its risk relative to the average for its investment objective.<p>


While the fund did well using all three risk measures, it is important to look behind the statistics. The annual report of the sample aggressive growth fund, which details actual holdings and industry breakdowns, shows some concentration in health care/medical and technology, two volatile industries that may not track the market. These concentrations may make the benchmark comparison--and thus beta--less meaningful. For this fund, total risk and risk relative to its investment objective may be more useful risk measures.<p>


AAII's "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds," lists beta for common stock funds and a total risk ranking based on five breakdowns--high, above average, average, below average, and low. This latter measure ranks the standard deviation of return for all funds in the Guide.<p>


While you may not make any of these calculations, you should develop an intuitive understanding of risk in order to judge performance. Looking at portfolio composition with respect to the cash/stock mix, the industry representation, and the type of stocks (small versus large) will point you in the direction of an appropriate benchmark and a judgment as to relative risk.<p>


Comparing fund performance to investment objective averages while judging differences in risk from the average risk for the fund objective is probably the easiest method with the most information available. The key is not high or low absolute returns, but how a fund or investment portfolio performed relative to the risks undertaken. <p>


Higher returns, on average, are only achieved with higher risks, a simple idea all too often forgotten.<p>

<H3>Market Risk/Return </H3><p>


<strong>Equation:</strong><p>


Required Rtn = Riskfree Rtn + Beta(Mkt Rtn - Riskfree Rtn)<p>


Required Return = Return required based on level of risk<p>


Risk-Free Return = Return on Treasury bills<p>


Market Return = Benchmark return<p>


Market Return - Riskfree Return = Return premium required for holding a diversified, but risky, portfolio instead of a riskfree portfolio<p>


Beta = Fund beta<p>

<br>

<strong>For Sample Aggressive Growth Fund:</strong><p>


Required Return = 5.6% + 1.19 (33.1% - 5.6%) = 38.3%<p>


Actual Return = 65.4%<p>


Return Above Required Return = 65.4% - 38.3% = 27.1%<p>

<br>

<h3>Total Risk/Return Evaluation</h3><p>


<strong>Equation:</strong>
<p>


Required Rtn =<p>


Riskfree Rtn + Total Risk Ratio(Mkt Rtn - Riskfree Rtn)<p>

                   Standard Deviation of Fund

Total Risk Ratio = ----------------------------

                   Standard Deviation of Market

<br>

<strong>For Sample Aggressive Growth Fund:</strong><p>


Required Return = 5.6% + (33.1% - 5.6%) = 40.8%<p>


Actual Return = 65.4%<p>


Return Above Required Return = 65.4% - 40.8% = 24.6%<p>

<h3>Investment of Objective Risk/Return Evaluation </h3><p>

Riskfree Rtn + Inv Obj Risk Ratio (Inv Obj Rtn - Riskfree Rtn)<p>

Inv. Obj. Risk Ratio = -----------------------------------

                       Std Deviation of Inv. Obj. Category
</PRE>
<br>
Inv. Obj. Return. = Return average for funds with similar investment objectives<p>

<br>

<strong>For Sample Aggressive Growth Fund:</strong><p>


Required Return = 5.6% + (51.1% - 5.6%) = 50.4%<p>


Actual Return = 65.4%<p>


Return Above Required Return = 65.4% - 50.4% = 15%<p>
