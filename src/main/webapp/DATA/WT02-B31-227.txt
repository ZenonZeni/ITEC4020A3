<TABLE><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="images/rob08.gif" BORDER=2 ALT="Picture of Robot"></TD>
<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>
Machine vision system with updated vision software capabilities.  Based on a real-time frame graber (512 x 512 pixels, 256 gray levels), with multiframe/multicamera capabilities.  Multiple vision parameters such as camera gain/offset, threshold, etc., can be set for each application.  Explicit shape analysis and measurements are conducted.  All vision software, data and images are displayed on a color VGA monitor.

<CENTER><H2>ER-Compact CIM</H2></CENTER>
<TABLE><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="images/rob09.gif" BORDER=2 ALT="Picture of Robot"></TD>
<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>
The ER-Compact CIM utilizes Eshed Robotec's CIM concept for the price conscious educator, or where space for a full scale CIM (ER-CIM) is not available, hence making CIM training even more affordable! The ER-Compact CIM software utilizes the same screens and procedures as the ER-CIM software.  IT is designed to facilitate upgrading into a full industrial CIM.
