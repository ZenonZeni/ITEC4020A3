</HEAD><BODY><P>Acne is a disease of the sebaceous glands of the skin. It
usually affects teenagers starting at the age of puberty. The face and upper
back are the locations most often involved. There are a variety of treatments
that are effective. Often antibiotics are used, either orally or applied
to the skin. Other treatment involves medication that opens the pores so
the glands drain better. For the most severe cases a medication called accutane
is very effective.
