<H3>VENUS FLYTRAP-Powerful Immune System Booster and Cancer Treatment</H3>
A medicine called Carnivora&reg;, made from Venus Flytrap found commonly in wet pinelands
and sandy bays of North and South Carolina, has strongly positive effects in the
treatment of numerous malignant diseases, especially cancer, and in improving immune
function when it has become impaired, according to new research from Germany.
Carnivora&reg; is a standardized plant-derived drug made from the sterilized, pressed
juice of fresh Venus Flytrap <I>(Dionaea Muscipula)</I> plants.

<P>In a clinical study with 210 cancer patients, for whom conventional treatments had
failed, each received 50-60 drops of Carnivora&reg; orally 5 times a day plus one
injection. The results were excellent: 16% of patients showed tumor remission and 40%
had no further tumor progression; in the remaining 43% no improvement was noted,
although about one-quarter of these patients experienced a palliative effect. This
means they felt a decrease in subjective complaints and pain and an increase in
appetite, vitality, and positive attitude. The study showed that more than half, or
56%, experienced either a tumor remission or that their cancer development became
stable and did not worsen.

<P>In a second study, after previous conventional therapies failed, 57 patients (average
age 51, with malignancies or chronic immune disorders) took 2 ml of Carnivora&reg; daily
for 116 days. At the end of this trial period, 57% reported an improvement in their
condition, 25% showed no change, and 18% worsened. Put differently, 45.5% of patients
experienced tumor remission; for 34.5%, the tumors became stationary; and 20% had no
change. 

<P>Carnivora&reg; is an immunomodulator, which means it stimulates the activity of T-helper
cells which, in turn, enable the body to wage a more vigorous defense against the
illness, explains Helmut Keller, M.D., medical director of the Chronic Disease
Control and Treatment Center in Bad Steben, Germany, where he uses the Venus Flytrap
product on cancer patients. 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Carnivora&reg; is 
available as drops or injectable ampules from Carnivora-Forschungs-Gmbh, Postfach 6, 
Lobensteiner Strasse 3, D-96365 Nordhalben, Germany; tel: 09267-166; 
fax: 09267-1040.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>According to Dr. Keller, the substance is also effective in treating ulcerative
colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, neurodermitis,
chronic fatigue syndrome, HIV infection, and certain kinds of herpes. It is also
recommended as an adjunct to strengthen the effects of antibiotics. 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTION:</FONT> Side effects are minimal: taken orally without dilution, Carnivora&reg; can sometimes
produce nausea or vomiting; when injected, it can produce a temporary increase in
body temperature. Ninety-day studies with rats in which the rodents received doses
30-60 times higher than the recommended human dose reported no toxic reactions.

<H3>HEAL SPORTS INJURIES AND REGROW DAMAGED TISSUE - Light Beams Tone Your Lymph System</H3>
Although lymphatic therapy, or the manipulation and draining of the body's 600 lymph
nodes, is the fourth most commonly prescribed medical treatment in Europe, in the
U.S. it is almost unknown. Yet an unimpeded lymph system, which carries immune cells,
is essential not only for health, but in enabling the body to heal from serious
illnesses, soft tissue damage, breast cancer, and prostatitis, among others.

<P>European physicians often use a manipulation technique called Manual Lymph Drainage
to unclog the lymph system, yet a new device called the Light Beam Generator can
accomplish in one session what would otherwise require 8 treatments of hands-on lymph
massage and drainage.

<P>Developed by ELF Laboratories of Evansville, Indiana, the Light Beam Generator is a
portable device, the size of a small suitcase. Based on the principles of energy
medicine,  the Generator contains a radio transmitter, a fiber-optics-mounted
flashlight attachment, and small amounts of inert gases such as neon, argon, xenon,
and helium.  

<P>An electronic pulse (728Hz) from the radio transmitter excites the inert gases; they
radiate subtle energy as light which is then pulsed into living human tissue through
contact with the handheld light beam generator &quot;flashlight.&quot; 

<P>The Generator gets excellent results in soft tissue regeneration work with patients
who have torn cartilage, sports injuries, or need post-operative rehabilitation,
reports Sky David, R.P.T., a physical therapist working in Santa Fe, New Mexico, who
has used this FDA-approved device for 4 years. &quot;It literally provides a <I>light</I> touch,
and helps get the inflammatory response to tissue injury out of the way so healing
and regeneration can start,&quot; says David. &quot;I often use it on a patient for 5-8 minutes
before doing manual lymph therapy.&quot;

<P>In two published cases (among many), David used the Light Beam Generator (LBG) to
heal and regenerate torn knee cartilage in a 37-year-old mountain climber. During
90-minute sessions, David used the LBG and manual lymph drainage. In a second case,
David eliminated longstanding pain and restricted hip joint movement. David is also
using this approach to work on breast tissue regeneration in cases of mastectomy. The
future of physical therapy lies not in postoperative rehabilitation, David says, &quot;but
in post-injury tissue regeneration.&quot;

<A NAME="SILVER"> </A>
<H3>THE ANTIBIOTIC WITH A SILVER LINING -
Why Colloidal Silver is Making a Comeback as a Broad 
Spectrum Antibiotic</H3>

If you're any of at least 650 different germs, contact with colloidal silver is your
worst nightmare, for this ultrafine liquid suspension of tiny particles of silver is
completely toxic to microorganisms that don't belong in the human system, whether
it's the eyes or intestines, the gums or the skin. But if you are the host, that is,
a human being, scientific studies indicate that there are no harmful side effects at
all from taking silver in this way. 
<P>
In other words, in a time when  disease organisms are mutating to become increasingly
immune to standard antibiotics, here is a new nontoxic substance in the presence of
which they cannot survive. 

<P>The irony here is that, prior to the advent of biochemical antibiotics in the 1930s,
the use of colloidal metallic silver as a broad- spectrum agent against bacteria,
viruses, and disease-producing &quot;germs&quot; was actually widespread in Western medicine.
Colloidal silver is making a comeback in the 1990s with a surprising range of uses,
which include use as a disinfectant for municipal and home water purification; as a
topical ointment for burns (both mild and severe); as an aid for  conjunctivitis; and
as a help for skin infections and ulcers. 

<P>Atomized, then inhaled through a mister, colloidal silver can be sprayed into the
nose or throat as a disinfecting throat gargle against staph infections or septic
tonsillitis. It works as a pain reliever for dental abscesses or as a catalyst for
bone growth and regeneration following injury. Taken orally, silver is a digestive
aid against fermentation of food in the stomach; it also works as a germicidal agent
in the treatment of herpes, intestinal parasites, even cancer. 
<A NAME="ulcer"> </A>
<P>In 1978, <I>Science Digest</I> reviewed the medicinal properties of colloidal silver,
especially in treating severe burns  and diabetic skin ulcers, and concluded:
&quot;Perhaps it soon will be recognized as our mightiest germ fighter.&quot; According to
research drawn from 37 countries, the number of medical uses for colloidal silver now
total 87, including that of  general immune system enhancer.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTION:</FONT> There is some concern among physicians that colloidal 
silver may leave trace deposits
of silver (which is, technically, a heavy metal) in the body. According to
cardiologist-internist William Lee Cowden, M.D., of Dallas, Texas, it's advisable to
proceed with caution when using colloidal silver for <I>internal</I> use. Dr. Cowden
recommends that after using colloidal silver for an extended internal treatment
period you should take steps to remove the silver from your system. Approaches
include taking homeopathic silver <I>(Argentum nitrate),</I> EDTA chelation, or
homeopathically prepared  DMPS (dimercapto-propane sulfonate) which is a chelator
that will bind up silver and remove it).
