<H3>From AOL's Rules of the Road:<BR>
<BR>
5. Public Communication </H3>
AOL offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally
accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member.
Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members,
such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards.
AOL Inc. will maintain AOL Public Areas as an open forum for discussion
of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc.
will administer standards of online conduct according to the AOL Rules for
the enjoyment of all its Members. While AOL Inc. will endeavor to monitor
the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL
Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in
the role of &quot;Big Brother&quot; by screening public communication in
advance.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content
on AOL which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to any Member, the
communities which comprise AOL, AOL Inc.s and third-parties rights, or to
violate applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc.
nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct,
communication or Content which might violate the AOL Rules prior to transmission
on AOL, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of actually or potentially
violating Content after online posting. Accordingly, you acknowledge that
neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume or have any liability
for any action or inaction by AOL Inc. or any ICP with respect to conduct,
communication or Content on AOL.<BR>

<H3>4. Third Party Software and Services</H3>
<BR>
In addition to content and services provided by Information Providers and
AOL Inc., other third parties may offer additional content, software or
other services to Members. Members may be subject to any additional terms
and conditions relating to the use of such third party content, software
or services and failure to abide by these terms and conditions may result
in termination of Membership. Furthermore, use of other networks, including
areas of the Internet, may be subject to any usage policies of such networks.
