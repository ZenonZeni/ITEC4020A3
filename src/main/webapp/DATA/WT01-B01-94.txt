<I>Obshchaya Gazeta</I>            correspondent <B>Nadezhda Chaikova</B> was found murdered execution-style on March 30, 1996, by residents of the village of Gekhi, about 20 kilometers outside the Chechen capital of Grozny. Chaikova, who had frequently traveled to Chechnya and the surrounding regions, was known for her hard-hitting coverage of the war in the breakaway republic and issues such as Russian authorities' use of special "filtration" prison camps to control the population.<P>

In a follow-up to a conversation in early May, Chaikova's colleagues reiterated to CPJ on June 11 that the federal Russian prosecutor's office still has not opened an investigation into her death and that the local Chechen village prosecutor who originally took up the case is unlikely to get far because of limited resources. The editors of <I>Obshchaya Gazeta</I>, a respected weekly with a circulation of about 10,000, have mounted their own investigation and have sent reporters to the scene to check various hypotheses of her murder. <P>

A statement by a local official and a note by Chaikova point to federal troops as the suspects. But other clues indicate that Chechen leaders themselves may have ordered her death, believing that she was a spy and perhaps acting on rumors spread by the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB). No firm allegation can be made because no central Russian investigation has been opened.<P>

Chaikova was last seen by colleagues toward the end of March. Jaromir Stetin of the Czech news agency Epicenter saw her on March 19 when she filed her report from the blockaded village of Sernovodsk, and <I>Komsomolskaya Pravda</I> reporter Alexander Yevtushenko saw her on March 20. They both reported that Chaikova was headed for Samashki and had plans to disguise herself as a Chechen peasant woman in order to cover the news there. She was often known to dress in a kerchief and long black skirt to appear "just like a local," according to <I>Obshchaya Gazeta </I>correspondent Alexander Trushin.<P>

Trushin and colleagues from the Russian wire services ITAR-TASS and Postfactum went to Chechnya in early April to look for Chaikova after she had been missing for more than 10 days and had failed to make a scheduled phone call to the newspaper's editorial offices in Moscow. The journalists started their search in Grozny, showing crowds of demonstrators her picture. They then worked their way through Chechen villages, some recently bombed by federal troops, interviewing residents there and placing ads about Chaikova's disappearance on local commercial television stations. <P>

In Samashki, a local government official said that Chaikova had spent the night of March 20-21 in his village, then left with refugees through a safe corridor made by the Russian military and reportedly had been headed toward Zakan-Yurt-Kulary. "Go look for her at the federals' [the Russian federal troops' base]," the official instructed<B> </B>Trushin.<B> </B>"She had a camera and photographed everything they committed here." At the time, Russian troops were surrounding Samashki while they completed mop-up operations, detaining many civilians suspected of harboring guerrillas.<P>

Chechen fighters then told Trushin and his colleagues<I> </I>that an unidentified woman had been buried in a neighboring village and advised them to inquire at the Urus-Martanovsky District prosecutor's office. There the reporters discovered photographs that clearly indicated that Chaikova had been beaten, blindfolded, forced into a kneeling position, and shot in the back of the head. The prosecutor explained that her body had been discovered on the outskirts of Gekhi near a sewage pipe but that a forensic examination indicated that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dumped outside the village. When she was found, villagers buried her in their local cemetery in a Muslim ceremony. Her body was exhumed April 12, and the Moscow correspondents made a positive identification.<P>

Chaikova is only one of at least five journalists who have been assassinated while covering the war in Chechnya, and four others are missing and presumed dead. The Yeltsin government has failed to properly investigate, much less prosecute, a single case. Nor has it done so for the cases of eight other journalists who have been murdered for their work since 1994. In each and every instance, CPJ has demanded that President Yeltsin order a thorough investigation and bring to justice those responsible for the murder of journalists. And we have also written to President Clinton urging him to press for full investigations and public disclosure of the findings in these cases. Please join us in our appeal by sending your own letter to President Yeltsin.<P>

If you have any further questions about Chaikova's case, please direct them to Catherine Fitzpatrick, CPJ's program coordinator for Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. You can contact her by phone (212-465-1004, ext. 101), fax (212-465-9568) or E-mail <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:europe@cpj.org">(europe@cpj.org)</A>.
