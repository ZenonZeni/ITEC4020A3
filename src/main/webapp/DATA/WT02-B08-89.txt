MENTAL HEALTH CONGRESS OPENS IN MELBOURNE<BR>
<HR><BR>
</H1>
A MEDICAL congress being held in Melbourne this week was giving international
recognition to Australia's place at the forefront in the treatment of mental
disorders, Professor Graham Burrows said today.<BR>
<BR>
He was speaking as more than 4000 psychiatrists and other medical experts
arrived for the 20th congress of the CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacolgicum),
which will be officially opened at 8.15am tomorrow (Monday 24 June) by the
Premier, Mr Jeffrey Kennett, in the World Congress Centre.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Burrows, head of the department of psychiatry at Melbourne University/Austin
and Repatriation Medical Centre, chaired a committee that spent eight years
arranging for the congress to be held here.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This congress is the major forum for the area of treatment -- in particular,
the biology, pharmacology, sociology and psychology of psychiatric disorders,&quot;
Professor Burrows said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The importance of the congress, which is held every two years, is
that it gathers psychiatrists and experts from other disciplines from all
around the world so that we can learn from each other and share the latest
developments.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Among highlights of tomorrow's (Monday's) congress sessions will be a media
conference (in the centre's press room at 1.30pm) on drugs, including marijuana
depression, and another media conference (press room, 4pm) on AIDS. <BR>
<BR>
The conference will end on Thursday. At 4pm each day there will be a media
conference at which some of the specialists attending the conference will
discuss the latest developments in psychiatry.<BR>
<BR>
Every effort will be made to fit in with members of the media who have special
interview requirements because of deadlines.<BR>
