<H2>Tip Of The Month for January 1997</H2>
by Timothy Lutts
</center>

<P>
We believe your investment success comes from two factors.  One is avoiding
big mistakes.  In recent years, many investment advisors have been far too
cautious.  Misplaced concerns about fundamentals like price/earnings ratios
and dividend yields have kept them from enjoying this great bull market.
And that's been a big mistake.  (According to Hulbert, we rank fifth in
market timing over the past fifteen years.  We are proud of that record.)
<P>
The other factor is your ability to pick a few great stocks. . . . .and
hold them for their entire upward move.  You don't need many.  Past big
winners for us, for example, include Cisco, Home Depot, American Power
Conversion and Summit Technology.  From today's portfolio holdings, any one
has the potential to multiply your money manyfold. . . . .if you just give
it time.
