FY 1996 Reconciliation Bill <P>
Reston, VA -- October 26, 1995 -- The FY 1996 reconciliation bill is now on the floor of both the House and the Senate.  The bill is the legislative implementation of the Republicans' goal to balance the budget by the year 2002.  It contains a variety of other pieces of legislation, including changes in taxes [the bill provides for $245 billion in tax cuts], spending caps for discretionary spending -- including education -- cuts in student loans, and changes in<BR>
Medicare and Medicaid. <P>
Following is a letter CEC sent to various members of the House, describing the disastrous effects the reconciliation bill would have on the provision of services for children and youth with disabilities.<P>
Please call your Representatives and Senators and urge them to oppose this reconciliation bill.  You can use the information in the letter as talking points to support our position.  Also, please contact the White House at (202) 456-1414 and urge President Clinton to not compromise on this issue, and fulfill his promise to veto the legislation. <BR>
Thanks for your help!!!<P>

U.S. House of Representatives<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20515<P>
Dear Representative:<P>
On behalf of the 54,000 members of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), an organization of teachers, administrators, parents and others concerned with the education of children with disabilities and the gifted, we urge you to oppose the FY96 reconciliation bill.  The bill would cut education programs, eliminate Medicaid provisions allowing schools to be reimbursed for costs associated with the education of children with disabilities, and eliminate<BR>
currently required Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Program services.  <P>
<B>Cuts in Funding for Education Programs</B>.  The FY96 reconciliation bill would cut education programs and impose discretionary program funding caps that would cut education an estimated 33 percent over the next seven years.  Our nation needs a well-educated populace to carry us into the next century.  Rolling back the federal commitment to our children is shortsighted and will result in students less prepared to enter the workforce and financially unable to enter postsecondary institutions, and will result in less research and development being conducted that will generate better ways to educate our young.  Special education serves over 5 million children.  The Federal government has promised to pay 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure to assist with the costs of providing education services to children with disabilities.  Currently, the Federal government is contributing a mere 8 percent. CEC urges the Congress to strongly reject further cuts in education and support an increased<BR>
investment in our children.  <P>
<B>Elimination of Medicaid Provisions Allowing Reimbursements for Schools</B>.  Schools provide a wide range of services to children with disabilities in order to further educate and prepare them for life after school.  Going on to further education, having a job, living independently, and getting along in the community are all goals of children with disabilities and the teachers that teach them the necessary skills.  Currently, if a child is eligible for Medicaid services, schools are allowed to seek reimbursement for school-based health services they provide.  To financially strapped schools, these Medicaid reimbursements allow school funds to be stretched for other services and purposes.  Under the FY96 reconciliation bill the provisions allowing schools to seek reimbursement would be eliminated.  CEC asks Congress to support schools and reject the elimination of these provisions!<P>
<B>Elimination of Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services</B>.   Currently, Medicaid requires States to provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services.  These comprehensive services ensure that low-income children receive physical exams, appropriate immunizations, laboratory tests, vision tests, dental services and hearing services.  These services are critical for identifying children with disabilities and promoting early intervention.  The IDEA Part H early intervention program is also able to receive Medicaid reimbursement for the services provided to eligible infants and toddlers.  The earlier an infant is identified as having a disability the earlier we can provide necessary services and prepare the child for school!  Early intervention is the key to lessening the lifelong impact of a disability on a child.   Because the reconciliation bill would eliminate these services, we urge Congress to oppose the elimination of EPSDT and ensure low-income children EPSDT services in any Medicaid legislation.      <P>
For all of these stated reasons, the Council for Exceptional Children opposes the FY96 reconciliation bill and urges you to vote "no" on final passage.   Please do not hesitate to contact CEC for additional information.<P>
Sincerely,<P>
<BR>
B. Joseph Ballard<BR>
Assistant Executive Director for Public Policy
