<P>
There is a high degree of consensus about the general principles governing radioactive waste management.  The general objective is to manage the waste in such a way as to protect human health and the environment and to limit any burden placed on future generations. 
<P>
The internationally accepted way to achieve this is to process any waste which is not already in a stable solid form into such a form, to encase it, and to place it in a near surface or an underground disposal facility, according to the characteristics of the waste.  (Where appropriate, these steps may take place after periods of storage which reduce handling and disposal problems.) The 'multi-barrier approach' used is designed to keep the radioactive substances away from people's environment with a series of separate physical and chemical barriers until the process of radioactive decay makes them barely distinguishable from naturally occurring materials.  The multi-barrier approach sets standards for the safe disposal of radioactive waste which go far beyond those now applied to the disposal of other toxic and hazardous wastes. 
<P>
The principles governing radiological protection are that activities released and resultant doses must be limited to those that: 
<UL>
<LI>are justified by a net benefit - for waste, the benefit is considered in the context of the whole nuclear energy production process and other uses of radioactive substances;
<LI>optimise protection according to the principle of keeping all exposures as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), economic and social factors being taken into account - for waste this mostly applies to choices of options, for example, between delayed and immediate final disposal;
<LI>keep risks to individuals at acceptable levels. 
</UL>
There are systems of notification, registration and licensing to ensure fulfilment of these principles by keeping to the regulations and standards laid down by the internal and national control institutions to ensure adequate safety for the present and future. 
<P>
The principles governing radioactive waste management are not confined to radiological protection and the protection of the environment and natural resources, but also cover ethical and social considerations, and, where appropriate, non-proliferation safeguards. 
<P>
The ethical and sociological principles are care for others, including future generations, the 'pay if you pollute' principle, and compensation for any damage (civil liability). Protection of environmental and natural resources includes the prevention and rectification of damage. 
<P>
The purpose of non-proliferation safeguards is to prevent the improper diversion of nuclear materials to military purposes.  <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/safetab.html">States party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</A> accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification of their fulfilment of their obligations under the treaty. 
<P>
National strategies for waste management differ considerably.  This reflects the availability of a choice of methods for achieving the same objectives and fulfilling the same principles rather than any uncertainty about whether they can be achieved.  An adequate level of safety can be assessed and ensured in a number of different ways.
