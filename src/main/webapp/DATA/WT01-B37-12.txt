<b> YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM:<br>
A GROWING NATIONAL PROBLEM<br>
<u><b>Overview<br>
</b></u></b>For close to two decades, the criminal justice system
in the United States has been undergoing a tremendous expansion.
Beginning in 1973, the number of prisoners, criminal justice
personnel, and taxpayer dollars spent has increased dramatically,
with new record highs now being reached each year. Between 1973
and 1988, the number of felons in state and federal prisons
almost tripled from 204,000 to 603,000. By 1989, the total inmate
population in our nation's prisons and jails had passed the one
million mark. <br>
Record numbers of persons are also being placed under probation
or parole supervision. These aspects of the criminal justice
system are sometimes overlooked when the problems of prison and
jail populations and overcrowding are explored.<br>
The extended reach of the criminal justice system has been far
from uniform in its effects upon different segments of the
population. Although the number of women prisoners has increased
in recent years at a more rapid pace than men, the criminal
justice system as a whole still remains overwhelmingly male
approximately 87 percent. And, as has been true historically, but
even more so now, the criminal justice system disproportionately
engages minorities and the poor.<br>
<u><b>Impact of the Criminal Justice System<br>
</b></u>This report looks at the impact of the criminal justice
system as a whole on the new generation of adults those people in
the 2029 age group. In particular, it examines the devastating
impact that the criminal justice system has had on the lives of
young Black men and Black communities.<br>
This report does not attempt to explain whether or why Blacks are
disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system. Other
studies have attempted to document whether Black males commit
more crimes or different types of crimes than other groups, or
whether they are merely treated more harshly for their crimes by
the criminal justice system. Instead, this report looks at the
end result of that large-scale involvement in the criminal
justice system, and highlights the implications this raises for
crime control policies. <br>
Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Bureau
of the Census, we have calculated the rates at which different
segments of the 2029 age group come under the control of the
criminal justice system. The analysis looks at the total number
of persons in state and federal prisons, jails, probation, and
parole, and compares rates of criminal justice control by race,
sex, and ethnicity. Because of the unavailability of complete
data in some categories of the analysis, the total rates of
control should not be considered exact calculations, but rather,
close approximations of the numbers of persons in the system. As
described in &quot;Methodology,&quot; in all cases where data
were lacking, conservative assumptions were used in making
calculations. (Sufficient data were not available to analyze
criminal justice control rates for Native Americans or Asian
Americans.)<br>
Our findings, as displayed in Tables 1 and 2, are as follows: <br>
 Almost one in four (23 percent) Black men in the age group
2029 is either in prison, jail, on probation, or parole on any
given day.<br>
 For white men in the age group 2029, one in 16 (6.2 percent)
is under the control of the criminal justice system.<br>
 Hispanic male rates fall between these two groups, with one in
10 (10.4 percent within the criminal justice system on any given
day).<br>
 Although the number of women in the criminal justice system is
much lower than for men, the racial disproportions are parallel.
For women in their twenties, relative rates of criminal justice
control are:<br>
Black women one in 37 (2.7 percent)<br>
White women one in 100 (1 percent)<br>
Hispanic women one in 56 (1.8 percent)<br>
 The number of <u>young</u> Black men under the control of the
criminal justice system 609,690 is greater than the <u>total</u>
number of Black men of <u>all ages</u> enrolled in college
436,000 as of 1986. For white males, the comparable figures are
4,600,000 total in higher education and 1,054,508 ages 2029 in
the criminal justice system.<br>
 Direct criminal justice control costs for these 609,690 Black
men are $2.5 billion a year.<br>
 Although crime rates increased by only 2 percent in the period
1979-88, the number of prison inmates doubled during that time.<br>
These findings actually <u>understate</u> the impact of present
policies upon Black males ages 2029. This is because the analysis
presented here covers criminal justice control rates <u>for a
single day in mid1989</u>. Since all components of the criminal
justice system admit and release persons each day, though, the
total number of persons processed through the system in a given
year is substantially higher than the single day counts. For this
reason, the proportion of young Black men processed by the
criminal justice system <u>over the course of a year would be
even higher than one in four</u>.<br>
<u><b>Implications for Social Policy<br>
</b></u>The findings of this study, particularly those pertaining
to young Black men, should be disturbing to all Americans.
Whatever the causes of crime be they individual or societal we
now have a situation where one in four Black men of the new adult
generation is under the control of the criminal justice system.<br>
The implications of this analysis for social policy both within
and outside the criminal justice system are farreaching:<br>
1. <u>Impact on the life prospects for Black males<br>
</u>The repercussions of these high rates of criminal justice
control upon young Black men are greater than their immediate
loss of freedom. Few would claim that today's overcrowded
corrections systems do much to assist offenders in becoming
productive citizens after release. Despite the ideal that
offenders can &quot;pay their debt to society,&quot; the fact is
that most carry the stigma of being exoffenders for some time to
come. Thus, given these escalating rates of control, we risk the
possibility of writing off an entire generation of Black men from
having the opportunity to lead productive lives in our society.<br>
2. <u>Impact on the Black community<br>
</u>For the Black community in general, nearly onefourth of its
young men are under the control of the criminal justice system at
a time when their peers are beginning families, learning
constructive life skills, and starting careers. The consequences
of this situation for family and community stability will be
increasingly debilitating. Unless the criminal justice system can
be used to assist more young Black males in pursuing these
objectives, any potential positive contributions they can make to
the community will be delayed, or lost forever.<br>
A particularly ominous trend further emphasizes this point. At
the same time that an increasing proportion of Black males ages
2029 have come under the control of the criminal justice system,
Black male college enrollment fell by 7 percent in the decade
from 197686. The cumulative effect of these separate measures is
that fewer Black males are being prepared to assume leadership
roles in their community.<br>
3. <u>Failure of the &quot;get tough&quot; approach to crime
control<br>
</u>In many respects, the past decade can be viewed as an
&quot;experiment&quot; in the &quot;get tough&quot; approach to
crime. Proponents of this policy contend that cracking down on
crime through increased arrests, prosecutions, and lengthy
sentences will have a deterrent effect on potential lawbreakers.
Yet even with a tripling of the prison population since 1973, at
tremendous financial cost, victimization rates since that time
have declined less than 5 percent.<br>
4. <u>Implications for the &quot;war on drugs&quot;<br>
</u>National drug policy director William Bennett's drug strategy
similarly emphasizes a law enforcement approach to a social
problem. This approach is likely to result in even higher rates
of incarceration for Blacks and Hispanics since drug law
enforcement is largely targeted against &quot;crack,&quot; more
often used by low-income Blacks and Hispanics. As drug offenders
make up an increasing share of the prison population, the
non-white prison population will become disproportionately
larger. In Florida, for example, Blacks inmates now make up 73.3
percent of all drug offenders, compared to 53.6 percent of prison
admissions for other offenses. <br>
The Bennett proposal to lock up more offenders is hardly a novel
one. For more than twenty years, politicians have campaigned on
this basic platform. A continued emphasis on law enforcement at
the expense of prevention and treatment has little hope of
achieving longterm results.<br>
5. <u>Strategies for more effective criminal justice policies and
programs<br>
</u>While the reasons why Black men enter into the criminal
justice system are complex and need to be addressed with longterm
vision, there are immediate opportunities for change through the
criminal justice system. The goals of such changes should be to
reduce the harm caused by the system and to reduce the likelihood
of offenders returning to the system. The outlines of such a
strategy are as follows:<br>
 Divert as many youthful, minor and firsttime offenders as
possible from the criminal justice system entirely. Diversion
programs, dispute resolution processes, counseling and other more
satisfactory means for modifying offensive behavior could be used
more frequently than they are now.<br>
 Reverse the trend to &quot;criminalize&quot; socially
undesirable acts and to increase criminal penalties as a means of
controlling public behavior. Mandatory and lengthy prison terms
add to correctional populations, but do little to reduce crime.<br>
 Jail and prison should be sanctions of last resort for
offenders who cannot be diverted from the system. A range of
communitybased sentencing options exist which are less costly and
more effective than incarceration. More could be made available
through legislative appropriations. These include: <br>
- restitution to victims<br>
- community service<br>
- intensive probation supervision<br>
- treatment programs<br>
- employment and education<br>
- community corrections programs<br>
 Utilize the sentencing process the one point in the system
when there is the opportunity to craft a meaningful response to
the needs of victims, offenders, and the community to counteract
the trend toward increasing criminal justice control over Black
males. This can be accomplished by individual judges adopting
constructive alternatives and by developing true rehabilitative
programs designed to reverse current correctional priorities. <br>
6. <u>The need for a broad approach to crime and crime control <br>
</u>The problem of crime is one that can not be solved entirely
by the criminal justice system. Even with the most resourceful
police, prosecutors, judges, and corrections officials, the
criminal justice system is designed to be only a <u>reactive</u>
system, not one of <u>prevention</u>.<br>
At the same time that the nation has engaged in a criminal
justice control strategy over the past decade, funding to address
the conditions that contribute to crime has declined. While the
criminal justice system has processed young Black men in great
numbers, the official unemployment rate for Black men ages 1624
remains at 24 percent. (Adding the numbers of persons discouraged
from or not &quot;officially&quot; in the labor market would
result in a significantly higher figure.) It is time now to
&quot;experiment&quot; in crime control by attacking those social
factors that many believe provide a more direct link to crime,
such as unemployment, poverty, and substance abuse.<br>
<u><b>Conclusion<br>
</b></u>The problem of crime is a complex one and will not be
resolved overnight. Rather than viewing the solution as hopeless
or too longterm, though, there are real and immediate actions
which can be taken to prevent the next generation of Black males
from further swelling the ranks of correctional populations.<br>
Some of these steps involve a change in priorities and emphasis
within the criminal justice system. Programs and policies exist
in jurisdictions around the country which offer models of more
constructive resolution of criminal justice problems.<br>
Addressing the conditions which lead to crime in the first place
is a broad agenda which requires serious thought, attention, and
action. The decisions made today, though, in the areas of policy,
programs, and funding, will determine whether the criminal
justice system exerts as much control over the next generation of
Black males as it does for the current generation.<br>
<u><b>Methodology<br>
</b></u>The data on which these calculations are made are taken
from reports of the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the
Department of Justice, the Bureau of the Census, and the
Department of Education. A breakdown of the incarcerated
population by age, sex, and race was available for state prison
inmates (1986) and jail inmates (1983). Data on sex and race, but
not age, were available for federal prisoners, probationers, and
parolees (all 1986). Data for the age distribution for state
prisoners and jail inmates were used to develop a ratio of the
proportion of each group of prisoners (i.e. male and female
whites, Blacks, and Hispanics) in the 2029 age group. These
proportions were as follows: White Males 49.6%; Black Males
52.4%; Hispanic Males 51.6%; White Females 52.7%; Black Females
52.8%; Hispanic Females 60.0%. <br>
This ratio was then used to develop estimates by age for federal
prisoners, probationers, and parolees. While parolees and federal
prisoners are probably older on average than the state prison
population, probationers are probably younger. The greater number
of probationers would therefore make the overall estimate of the
2029 age group a conservative one. While some margin of error is
inevitable in these estimates, it seems reasonable to assume that
it is not of a substantial nature.<br>
Rates of criminal justice control were then developed for all
parts of the system for 1986 (except for 1983 figures for jail).
These figures were then extrapolated to June 1989, based on the
percentage increase for each component of the system. The most
recent overall population figures available were: state and
federal prisons June 1989; jails June 1987; probation and parole
December 1988. Annual growth estimates of 5 percent for
probation, 10 percent for parole, and 6 percent for jails, based
on trends for the past two years, were used to derive June 1989
population estimates based on the 1987 and 1988 data.<br>
The use of overall population increases results in some
additional margin of error in the total population figures. For
example, available data appear to indicate that the <u>rate</u>
of increase for prisoners for the period 198689 has been greater
for Blacks, Hispanics, and women than for the population as a
whole. Reports also indicate that Blacks make up an increasing
share of the total number of drug arrests, a major source of the
increasing criminal justice populations. Therefore, the total
criminal justice control rate for Black males is probably <u>understated</u>
in the calculations. <br>
Cost figures for various components of the criminal justice
system are those cited by the Department of Justice in <u>Report
to the Nation on Crime and Justice: Second Edition</u>, 1988.
Many observers believe that current cost figures are
substantially higher than those presented here. For example, we
have used the figure of $11,302 per year for state prisoners in
1984 from the <u>Report</u>. Many current estimates for costs of
incarceration are in the range of $15,00025,000 per year.<br>
Population figures within each category are based on Census
Bureau estimates of the U.S. resident population.<br>
As the available data for Hispanics are fairly limited in most
instances, these results should be interpreted with caution.<br>
