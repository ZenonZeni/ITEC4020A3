<font size=+2>THE TRANSFER OF FAMILY WEALTH</font>

</center>


<blockquote>

<font size=+2><b>T</b></font>he message that financial planners try to impress upon their
clients is the importance of wealth accumulation. Saving money in
the early years so that one can live comfortably in the "Golden
Years".  If you have followed this principle the next question then
becomes: How does one protect accumulated wealth from the tax man
should you die before you have spent it?  Also, how can you
transfer that wealth to your family minimizing probate fees as well
as taxes?<p>

Another scenario that should also be considered is that upon
retirement you may have accumulated more money than you need to
maintain your lifestyle but are reluctant to transfer funds to
other family members as yet. What can you do to protect your wealth
from taxes?<p>

A universal life insurance contract may be the answer.  By
depositing funds into such a plan, the growth of this money within
the plan remains tax sheltered, that is... the income does not have
to be reported on your annual tax return.  Taxes are paid upon
withdrawal from the plan.  You have the advantage that the growth
can be used at a later time if required or can be part of the
estate capital upon death in which case the heirs receive all
monies including the investment returns tax free.  A third
advantage is that the policy can always be used as collateral
should you need further funds but do not wish to undo the estate
plan. This approach could be used to supplement your retirement
income on a tax free basis.<p>

There is another interesting twist to the plan.  If you buy a life
insurance plan, as the owner of the contract you can make the life
insured a child or grandchild.  In most cases you can change the
ownership of the policy during your lifetime to a child or
grandchild on a tax-free rollover basis.  Effectively you have
transferred funds to your heirs without tax or probate fees.  The
life insurance part of the plan is of course payable only on the
death of the child but the premium is based on the child's age not
yours.  The amount you can invest tax sheltered has extensive
guidelines, otherwise wealthy individuals would literally transfer
millions to each of their heirs to avoid taxes.  There is however
still substantial room here for effective tax planning.  It is
important to talk to your financial advisor to establish whether
this program is right for you.<p>
