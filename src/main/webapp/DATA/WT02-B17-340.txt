<BLOCKQUOTE>Brazil is a country of continental size, and arguably the most biologically rich nation on Earth. History resulted in environmental problems as varied as its many distinctive ecosystems, threatening much of its biodiversity.  Fro more information about projects in Brazil, visit <a href="http://www.bdt.org.br/bdt/cibrasil/">CI-Brazil's homepage</a>.

<P>
 Starting with its first Portuguese settlers in the sixteenth
century, Brazil has fiercely pursued development.  Farming, mining,
logging, and development have delved into its rich biodiversity
with little thought to conserving its resources. Now, Brazil's
biodiversity -- considered the greatest of any country in the
world -- is at risk of becoming part of its mythic past.   

<P>
In
each of Brazil's five major ecosystems, CI Brazil is demonstrating
how innovative, local conservation strategies can counteract entrenched
patterns of misuse and poorly planned development.  But the sheer
scale of the challenges facing Brazil-- a country nearly the size
of the U.S.--necessitates major policy shifts at the national
level as well. 

<P><H4>Nationwide Policy Initiatives 
</H4>

<P>CI's strategy in
Brazil is a sophisticated mix of grassroots conservation projects,
national policy initiatives, and training efforts.  Through close
collaboration with a network of universities, NGOs, and community
groups, CI-Brazil is helping to trigger a sea-change in the way
Brazilians view their resources.  

<P>
CI-Brazil has formed significant
ties to more than a dozen major national and  international corporations
doing business in Brazil.  Representatives from these corporations
have joined CI's in-country advisory board--a way to secure steady
support for our long-term conservation strategy. 

<P>
CI-Brazil has
become a lead player in the conservation community and in 1995,
CI helped in the design of Brazil's new National Biological Trust
Fund.  Furthermore, the Board of the GEF's Biodiversity Fund for
Brazil appointed CI Brazil's vice president as a co-chair.  This
appointment affirms CI's vision of conservation and development,
and gives CI a major voice in which efforts receive funding.

<P>
<H4>Conservation
Science for Brazil </H4>

<P>

To help design Brazil's Biodiversity Strategy--an
important obligation under the international Biodiversity Convention--CI-Brazil
developed a priority-setting methodology and a Portuguese version
of CI's Geographic Information System, <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/compmap.htm">CISIG</A>, which now connects
more than 60 institutional and individual users nationwide.  CI
staff and its partners continue to provide training and distribute
CISIG data free of charge to NGOs and universities. 

<P>
In May 1995,
CI-Brazil launched its Internet home page, which can be reached
at www.conservation.org, housing more than 200 clkmaps of the distribution
of plants and animals, demographic and economic information, land
use.   It also houses the results from recent priority-setting
workshops for the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon basin.
