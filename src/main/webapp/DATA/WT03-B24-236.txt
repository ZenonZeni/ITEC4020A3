<h1><center> Contemplating agbiotech's future </h1> <p>
<b>By Karen Bernstein<br>
Editor-in-Chief</b></center><P>
It sometimes appears as if the agricultural biotechnology companies are disappearing before our eyes. Monsanto plans to buy half of Calgene Inc., biosys has acquired AgriDyne Technologies Inc. and Crop Genetics International, and ESCAgenetics Corp. has let most of its employees go. There are hardly enough companies to call ag bio a sector, stocks of the public companies trade at an average price of $3.86, and if biotech companies on the pharmaceutical side think venture capital is scarce, they should talk to their ag bio cousins.<p>
But while a superficial look at ag bio might lead to reports of its untimely demise, a closer inspection reveals a more complex -- and interesting -- picture. <p>
As in drug development, biotechnology has been fully integrated into the tools of plant breeding and pest control. The regulatory issues surrounding transgenic crops, herbicides and pesticides have largely been resolved. With the exception of bovine somatotropin, the anti-biotech forces have been unable to mobilize consumers against transgenic foods. And most importantly, the number of marketed ag bio products is much larger than a casual observer might guess, with numerous new products coming through the pipeline.<p>
To understand why investors have abandoned the sector and, more importantly, to understand what ag bio companies must accomplish going forward, it pays to look at where companies have stumbled in the past. <p>
<b><center>Early science</b></center><p>
Ag bio started later than biopharmaceuticals, and from a lower science and funding base. Work in the early 1980s focused on the basic enabling technology to transform plants and express genes. Only in the latter half of that decade was there any true commercial development, according to Simon Best, CEO of <b><center>Zeneca Plant Science. </b></center><p>
"When we started in 1981, no one knew how to get a gene into a plant," said Russell Smestad, co-general manager of Agracetus Inc., a Middleton, Wis., subsidiary of W.R. Grace. "We invested a lot of time and energy coming up with a toolkit that was enabling. As a result the timeline seemed atrociously long. Now the development cycle is a more normal seven to 10 years."<p>
<b><center>Commercialization</b></center><p>
Beyond technology development came the commercialization issues. "Years ago, I was soundly criticized for raising money when I had no apparent need for it," said Jerry Caulder, chairman and CEO of Mycogen Corp., a San Diego crop protection company that sells both biopesticides and transformed seed. "I said if you think research is expensive, wait until you do development." <p>
In addition, he said, "you have to couple that with the non-glamorous aspects of agriculture -- we never could raise the monies health care could raise. We've actually been better managers of money than people in health care."<p>
While a few companies, such as Monsanto Co. and Pioneer Hi-Bred have put significant sums into early stage research, they are the exception, said Smestad. "The agricultural industry doesn't have 15 percent of sales to put into research -- the profit margins aren't there," Smestad said.<p>
<b><center>Production and distribution</b></center><p>
But beyond the core technology, the factor that emerges as key is the complexity of production, marketing and distribution in agriculture, which in many respects makes the manufacture and marketing of drugs look simple. <p>
In general, a single drug can be used on patients anywhere in the world, but for plants, a different hybrid needs to be developed for every geographical region. And novel value-added traits are only commercially viable so long as yields can be maintained.<p>
In fact, said Robert Serenbetz, president and CEO of DNA Plant Technology Corp. (Oakland, Calif.), it's when all four of the biggest ag bio companies -- DNAP, Calgene Inc., Ecogen Inc., and MYCO -- made the step from R&D to commercialization that they ran into problems.<p>
"The real hang-up continues to be marrying traditional plant breeding with molecular biology," said Roger Salquist, chairman and CEO of CGNE (Davis, Calif.). "You do a transformation and you still have to do several generations of traditional breeding, while new varieties are coming onto the market every year. So you're always playing catch-up. <p>
"That means you need to have a very powerful trait, because you'll be working with a variety that isn't the latest one with marginally better agronomic properties.  And you have to do it in multiple growing conditions, which means doing it in several varieties."<p>
To complicate matters, the addition of new traits to crops won't necessarily change the overall dynamics of the business. Take herbicide resistance, for example. The ag-chemical companies would like the seed companies to sell seeds with resistance to their chemicals. "If they do -- and they will -- there won't then be any differentiation in the seed industry, so they won't be able to charge more," said Smestad. "So the competitive edge will still be yield. Thus the first things coming down the pike will make the industry different, but not necessarily more attractive economically. So biotech will be successful because all crops will be transgenic, but certain traits won't change the economics of the industry."<p>
This is not simply because agricultural products are commodities -- in fact, said Serenbetz, both seeds and chemicals are often highly differentiated. Rather, he said, the problem is the industry's cost structure: farmers can't pay the same kind of money for their inputs that the health care sector has been willing to bear for drugs.<p>
<b><center>P&L obsession</b></center><p>
James Reilly, chairman, president and CEO of Ecogen, a crop protection company in Langhorne, Penn., observed that farmers and growers have been very open to looking at new products. What they're not willing to do is pay a premium. "Unlike the pharmaceutical industry, growers aren't worried about life and death," he said. "What they're worried about is their P&L."<p>
For example, economics, as well as performance, affected the introduction of biopesticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis. Bt products have slower initial kill time. But farmers, who were used to fast-acting chemicals, were being asked to pay premium prices for the new biologicals.<p>
"I'm not sure if it was the slower action or pricing that slowed down acceptance" Smestad said. "The bio companies tried to price their products the same as chemicals. But if the biological is slower, farmers are losing crop while the insects are still active. The most important factor in anybody's equation is price. Pricing lower would have helped acceptance. The rule of thumb is to capture 25-30 percent of the value created, not 100 percent."<p>
In fact, good quality Bts will cause an insect to stop eating in about two minutes, even if it doesn't die for 24 hours. But the quality of the initial manufacturing proved to be low, further eroding the economics of the biopesticides.<p>
"Most of us felt we could just toll (contract) manufacture these products, but that was wrong," said Caulder. "In the past we tried for both market share and to keep margins up, and it didn't work. <p>
"Being a slower kill would have gone away as an issue if there had been competitive pricing, but toll manufacturers don't have much incentive to reduce price. We refused to sell the low quality product (that many of them produced), so we ended up having to sewer a lot of product. We've now spent $10 million for our own dedicated fermentation tanks. Now we can get high quality and we have brought costs down."<p>
biosys ran into similar price versus results issues when it introduced its nematode products, said Edwin Quattlebaum, president and CEO of the Columbia, Md., crop protection company. "When I first came to biosys, the board was telling me to increase prices, and we were already two to three times the cost of traditional chemistry. I cut prices and tripled market share in one year. For the last three to four years, we've doubled our share each year. A 10-15 percent premium is the maximum you can get, and even that's hard. That puts phenomenal pressure on your cost of goods."<p>
<p>
<b><center>Driven by distribution </b></center><p>
For companies like EECN, said Reilly, distribution will be the key issue for the next five years. The big task is putting together the detail sales force to get products to dealers, and to educate dealers and pest control advisors (PCAs).<p>
"The grower will come into the dealer, and he will have a recommendation from a PCA licensed by the state," Reilly said. "A Zeneca or Monsanto will have 40 people on the West Coast alone who can call on the dealers. They also have to know the PCAs. So it's necessary to have a large sales force -- that becomes the partnering issue."<p>
Companies also need more than one product for the sales force to sell. The initial focus of ag bio companies on single technologies wasn't viable, said Reilly, whose company now has four technologies and product lines.<p>
BIOS agrees that companies must have multiple technologies to succeed. "Companies thought their technology would be a home run," said Quattlebaum, "but the fact is that most technologies are singles, and it takes the same infrastructure for four or five technologies as it does for one, especially if they're complementary."<p>
<b><center>Branded prices hold</b></center><p>
For the branded food crops, premium pricing has proven to be less of an issue than some observers had predicted, said Serenbetz. Both DNAP and CGNE have been able to maintain their $1.99 tomato price to consumers. <p>
But other issues have affected margins. "If you harvest a field of tomatoes, not 100 percent will be able to be sold as MacGregor or FreshWorld Farms. Then you're at the mercy of the commodity price," he said. <p>
This year, the devaluation of the Mexican peso has lowered the cost of Mexican tomato production to one-third of the U.S. cost. The result has been a 15-20 year low in the price of commodity tomatoes.<p>
Similarly, bad weather in one part of the country can ruin an entire crop, as well as sales of pesticides and herbicides. Thus EECN's third quarter product sales were hurt by bad weather in the Mississippi delta, reinforcing the company's drive to expand its distribution to minimize the impact of bad conditions in one area.<p>
In the end, the complexity of the production and distribution process has led all of the independent companies to look at a more integrated structure, including multiple alliances in production, distribution and marketing.<p>
<p>
<b><center>Luring investors back</b></center><p>
Investors won't return to the sector until they see evidence they can make a return on their money. <p>
"There's no success model to convince people to put their money in there," said CGNE's Salquist. "The perception is that it takes longer and it's lower value than pharmaceuticals, and it will stay that way until we have a blockbuster. We're the model for the industry and we've got to start showing a profit." <p>
CGNE expects to be profitable in fiscal 1997, which starts July 1, 1996. CGNE has two engineered products on the market, its Flavr Savr tomato and BXN bromoxynil-resistant cotton, and is scaling up production of laurate canola. A second oils product also may be on the market by next year.<p>
<b><center>Broadened product lines</b></center><p>
DNAP is marketing tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, mini-peppers and carrots developed through either somaclonal variation or traditional breeding. Sugar snap peas will be launched in 1996. The company's engineered tomato has been taken off the market until patent issues with Monsanto are resolved.<p>
Four Monsanto products were approved in 1995: insect-resistant potatoes and cotton containing a Bt gene, soybeans that can be sprayed with Roundup herbicide, and a delayed-ripening tomato that the company currently doesn't plan to market. A fifth product, Roundup-ready cotton, may be approved by year-end and seven other plant products are in development.<p>
MYCO sells three Bt-based biopesticides and a line of corn plants containing Bt or natural resistance to insects. In 1996, it will begin sales of genetically engineered corn. The company will be on the edge of profitability from revenues in the fiscal year ending in August 1996.<p>
EECN also isn't far from profitability, Reilly said. It has improved manufacturing efficiency, has developed the novel technologies it bought earlier in the decade, and a cash infusion of up to $25 million from Monsanto and the technology validation of that deal will enhance the company's reputation with distributors, he said <p>
EECN has three Bt products on the market and will introduce two new products in 1996, one of which will replace an existing product. Two biofungicides and five pheromone-based products are marketed, and the company is a small player in nematodes.<p>
BIOS sells nematode products and is the second or third largest Bt contract manufacturer for companies such as EECN and Ciba-Geigy. It has two virus-based pest control products on the market and a third in development through its purchase of Crop Genetics. Also on the market are neem-based botanical insecticides through its acquisition of AgriDyne. <p>
Zeneca (Wilmington, Del.) will launch its first genetically modified product, processing tomatoes for tomato paste, in Europe next spring and in the U.S. later in the year.<p>
The blockbusters that will make the industry a success are just coming on the market, said Smestad. Both Monsanto's Bt cotton and the transgenic tomato products developed by several companies will be significant products, he predicted. <p>
Although it has no products of its own on the market, Agracetus helped develop Monsanto's Roundup-ready soybeans and CGNE's BXN cotton. <p>
<b><center>Evaluating deals</b></center><p>
Smestad thinks Monsanto's planned investment in CGNE should be viewed as an indicator of success rather than of failure: it's a measure of the value Monsanto puts on CGNE's technology and it makes CGNE a more fully integrated company. <p>
Monsanto's equity investment in EECN will gain access to its Bt library for in-plant uses. Similarly, Pioneer Hi-Bred's $30 million investment in MYCO to access its Bt crop protection technology further validates the importance of these technologies, Caulder said.<p>
One factor still slowing down the potential returns on certain genetically engineered crops is the lack of international regulatory harmonization and the lagging public acceptance of biotech outside the U.S. Zeneca's Best estimates that Japan is one to two years behind the U.S. and that Europe is two to three years behind. <p>
This is a major issue for field crops such as corn and soybeans, which rely on an open market for exports. If engineered crops have to be separated from non-engineered crops, the former simply won't be developed. As a result, said Best, the industry is working very hard to promote regulatory harmonization. Only when that is accomplished will sales of these crops take off in a big way, he said.<p>
<p>
<b><center>A place for small companies? </b></center><p>
The first generation of ag bio players have mixed feelings about the prospects for new, small companies. "I used to think you needed a $100 million revenue base, but I now think it's larger than that," Salquist said. <p>
"It takes too much money to get started, and it's more complicated than developing a protein," he said. "By definition you have to be fully integrated -- you have to be either a seed company or a processor or both, and that's big business, with the exception of some niches like the cotton business." <p>
The barriers to entry have been formidable. Not only did funds dry up after progress at the first generation of companies proved to be slower than anticipated, but intellectual property barriers also turned out to be critical when there were initially few ways of transforming plants.<p>
But that's all changing, said Zeneca's Best, who even though he comes from a large company, is one of the most sanguine about the future of small ag bio companies.<p>
Best, along with Smestad, argues that new ways to transform plants are being developed, together with novel promoters and transformation markers, all of which will lower technological barriers to entry. As a result, Best expects to see the formation of new companies and university spinouts from 1997 through the end of the decade.<p>
Nevertheless, barriers on the commercialization side will remain high, and few small companies will become fully integrated. Best thus expects to see a pattern resembling the research boutique model on the pharma side: small companies that provide novel technology that is partnered with the major seed and chemical companies, but with the capability to market niche products in the fruit and vegetable arenas.<p>
Trends that work in favor of smaller companies include the branding of crops that were previously commodities, and the increasing emphasis on value-added traits. "Most large players are actively seeking to drive the market that way," said Best. "In field crops, it takes only small value changes to trigger big shifts in use, as long as yield remains high."<p>
Agracetus also has concluded that branded, value-added traits are the only way to go. The company's goal is to be a niche player focused on high value-added traits for industry and pharmaceuticals. These include specialty cotton fibers and the use of plants as bioreactors to produce pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes.<p>
"What we're trying to do with our fiber program will be to contract production and then we will sell directly to the textile industry customer at a premium price," said Smestad. "An independent farmer couldn't produce our specialty products -- there's too much involved for him to prove the product has added value. You need an identity preservation system to track the product from the seed stage through final production. <p>
"To make it work, you have to be fully vertically integrated rather than an independent commodity producer. You don't have to own it all -- you can do it through alliances, which is more cost-effective."<p>
One model for the next generation of companies is NovaFlora Inc., a 1993 startup focused on development of value-added ornamental plants using tissue culture, somaclonal variation and genetic engineering. The Philadelphia company just began test marketing its first product, a miniature rose, and anticipates it will only take $2 million to reach profitability.<p>
Knowing that venture capital is unavailable for ag companies, NovaFlora received its startup funding from its first corporate partner, Star Rose Co., the second largest rose grower in the U.S. behind Jackson & Perkins. Having a partner from the start also avoids the commercialization problems that bedeviled the first generation of ag bio companies. "From our rose rollout, we can see the wisdom of working with a large, established partner," said President and CEO Michael Dobres. "It's very cost-effective, and through a royalty stream we have a guaranteed profit margin built in."<p>
Dobres said the flower industry, and roses in particular, is ideally suited for the value-added potential of biotech. The market is highly differentiated, the products aren't commodities, and consumers are constantly looking for innovative new plants.<p>
