 THREE-WAY SPLIT TO COST AT&T $4,000M


AT&T has released details of the lay-offs to be made and costs
incurred as a result of its planned reorganisation into three
companies (issue 192).

The company is to take a $6,000m charge against its fourth
quarter figures to cover the cost of its break-up, which entails
the redundancy of nearly 40,000 more employees. Around 30,000 of
the redundancies will be compulsory, following a poor response by
employees to its voluntary buy-out package at the end of last
year. Around 70% of these cuts will be made by the end of this
year, with the rest following within three years.

After tax, the charge - which covers facility close-downs and
asset write-downs as well as layoffs - will result in a charge of
$4,000m, or around $2.50 per share. As the company reported
profits of $4,700m for 1994, it may still manage a positive
result despite the charge. The charges include around $2,600m
pre-tax for redundancy pay and related costs, $1,700m in asset
write-downs, and $1,100m for closing, selling or consolidating
facilities.

Most affected by the announcement will be the company that is to
keep the AT&T name - the telephone service company - and the new
systems and technology company. AT&T Global Information
Solutions, formerly NCR, escapes relatively lightly, thanks to
the fact that it cut 8,500 people from the payroll in September.

The majority of the cuts will be in US-based operations and will
include around 100,000 corporate-wide jobs in areas such as
information systems, personnel and financial operations.

The company also plans to reduce the value of some assets,
including its Unitel Inc Canadian telecommunications venture and
several international units. It will modify some service
offerings, entailing the write-down of the value of some
proprietary software and hardware, and will also write down the
value of some unneeded network facilities such as microwave
towers and will refocus its undersea cable operations.

The cuts were in line with expectations and were well-received by
the market, where shares jumped $2.75 to $67.50 in early trading
after the announcement.

AT&T also says it is on track to file with the Securities &
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering for the
systems and technology company, and still expects to complete the
transaction by the end of the year.

 GE TO SPIN OFF EDS


Electronic Data Systems (EDS) Corp, based in Plano, Texas, could
be an independent company again as soon as the end of next month:
the US Internal Revenue Service has given its confirmation that
the proposed spin-off of the company to its Class E shareholders
by its parent General Motors (GM) Corp will be tax-free. GM
announced its intention to spin off EDS last August (issue 186)
following fruitless talks about a merger with BT Plc in May 1993
(issue 072) and Sprint Corp a year later (issue 123).

The deal still needs shareholder approval, and that could prove a
problem since GM Class E shareholders will see their shares
converted into those of the stand-alone company, but GM and Class
H holders have to approve the deal as well. Electronic Data
Systems' current market value is $25,000m, 10 times the $2,500m
the GM paid for it in 1984.

To qualify for tax-free status, the Detroit firm had to convince
the revenue men that the transaction has a legitimate business
purpose.

 ARTISOFT DIVERSIFIES WITH TRITON BUY


Tucson, Arizona-based Artisoft, Inc. has acquired Triton
Technologies Inc., a developer of remote control technology based
in Iselin, New Jersey. The cash transaction is valued at around
$11.6m.

The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase. According to
Artisoft, a "substantial" percentage of the purchase price for
Triton, and for the recently- acquired Synergy Solutions, Inc, is
attributed to in-process technology and will be charged to
operations in the current fiscal quarter.

Triton Technologies was founded in 1985. Under the CoSession
brand name, it produces remote control software allowing PCs to
be controlled remotely for OEMs including IBM Corp, NEC
Technologies Inc and Zenith Data Systems Corp. CoSession for
Windows 6.0, Triton's latest product release, began shipping
earlier late last year, offering increased file transfer rates,
multitasking capabilities and multiprotocol call waiting.
According to Artisoft, the Triton remote control technology fits
well with its recently-acquired modem/phone line sharing
technology.

Kurt Scheel, vp and cfo for Artisoft, sees the acquisition is a
natural extension to the company's strategy announced last year,
to exit the hardware business and focus on software: that
decision culminated in Artisoft's decision to divest itself of
Eagle Technologies Inc (issue 159) which it had bought it just
one year previously.

Sales channels were another reason why the fit was good,
according to Scheel - since  Triton has concentrated on OEM
sales, Artisoft feels that it can open up new markets by selling
Triton products through its existing channels, and conversely,
the deal will give Artisoft a foot in the door of the OEM market
for its existing product range.

Scheel denies that the diversification represents any de-
emphasising of Artisoft's flagship LANtastic network operating
system: "we're not de-emphasising that business so much as
diversifying our dependence on it" he says.

 COURT HEARS HAYES REORGANISATION PLAN


The US Bankruptcy Court of Georgia is in the middle of
confirmation hearings for Atlanta, Georgia-based Hayes
Microcomputer Products Inc's reorganisation plan, although it
will be some time before any decision is reached, due to factors
such as the speed of testimonies, and the US government shutdown.

Hayes representatives have been on the stand, but no decision
will be reached before the Court has also heard the alternative
plans put forward by US Robotics Inc (issue 197) and Diamond
Multimedia Systems Inc (issue 204).

The next hearing has been set for Thursday January 11th.

 NET LICENSING DEAL WITH CISCO EXPANDED


Redwood City, California-based Network Equipment Technologies
(NET) Inc has expanded its six year-old agreement with Cisco
Systems Inc by licensing the full suite of the latter's
Internetwork Operating System (IOS), and agreeing to resell the
full range of Cisco products globally. Through the original
agreement, NET licensed Cisco's router source code, which was
subsequently incorporated into the LAN/WAN Exchange module for
the company's IDNX multiservice bandwidth manager (issue 133).
NET now wants to expand that to include the other features of the
IOS, and in this way provide increased integration between its
wide area IDNX product, and Cisco-based LANs.

With this in mind, and as part of the reseller agreement, NET is
now also to make Cisco routers part of its preferred product
portfolio under its new Vista Architecture strategy (issue 184).
This agreement will also see NET providing consultancy services
for LAN design, and contract service.

While the IOS licensing agreement is indefinite, according to a
spokesman, the reseller agreement will run for two years although
NET has "every expectation that it will be renewed". Cisco was
picked as a result of its market leadership, said the spokesman,
who added that for this reason it is unlikely that NET will enter
into any similar deals with other router manufacturers.

 TYLINK OFFERS HDSL MODULE FOR MR2300


Norton, Massachussetts-based TyLink Corp has announced the
availability of an optional HDSL (high bit-rate digital
subscriber loop) Module for its MR2300 high-speed digital line
driver. The product is designed to allow users to take advantage
of their existing unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling, to
achieve data rates of up to T1 (1.544Mbps) over distances up to
12,000 feet.

According to TyLink, it works by allowing the delivery of an
outbound signal on the same pair of wires on which the return
signal is received: the transmitted signal is cancelled by the
receiver by precisely predicting the amount of signal echo and
subtracting it from the overall input signal. HDSL-based products
are designed to tolerate crosstalk and operate not only on
continuous unobstructed pairs of wires, but also on cables with
mixed wire gauges and bridge taps.

The TyLink MR2300 HDSL Module supports data rates from 672Kbps up
to 1.544Mbps, with the timing derived from an internal DTE clock.
The company says its MR2300 HDSL Module allows customers to
standardise on a single line driver for fibre-optic, STP, and UTP
applications. Different modules can be mixed and matched in a
single rack-mountable MR2300 chassis which can house up to ten
cards. Alternatively, the same modules can be used as stand-alone
units for remote sites.

The MR2300 HDSL Module costs $1,695 for the card version and
$2,695 for the stand-alone version; both are available now.

* TyLink also announced the appointment of Dick Swee as vice
president of engineering. Swee will be responsible for the
development of TyLink's entire line of digital access products.
Swee joins from UB Networks, where he held the same position.

 STRATACOM ADDS SVC SUPPORT TO BPX


San Jose, California-based StrataCom Inc has announced a new
software release for its BPX Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
switches, claiming among other things that it is the first to
support Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) across the wide area.
However, StrataCom is far from being first, since General
DataComm has had full support for SVCs on its Apex product line
(issue 161) since last September; Northern Telecom implemented it
back in June on its Magellan Vector product; and Cascade's new
500 switch (see Product News, page two) also features SVCs, and
is in beta test now with volume shipments due by the end of this
quarter - StrataCom has yet to commence beta tests of its new
release.

StrataCom says that its ATM SVCs will support ATM user-to-network
(UNI) interfaces ranging from T1/E1 (1.544Mbps/ 2.0Mbps) and
T3/E3 (45Mbps/34Mbps) up to OC-3/STM-1 (155Mbps). Support for
both UNI 3.0 and 3.1 is claimed, with translation betweeen the
two, while the company is also  planning support for ATM SVC
signalling for ATM Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed (AIMUX)
interfaces this quarter. StrataCom is also to support the Interim
Inter-Switch Signalling Protocol (IISP) for interoperability with
other vendors' ATM switches, and the Interim Local Management
Interface protocol for ATM connection management.

StrataCom is also adding new security features to its software,
including address screening of both source and destination by
port through a list of authorised or unauthorised addresses.
Additionally, the company has committed itself to implementing
the ATM security features currently under development by the ATM
Forum's Security Working Group.

 IBM DEVELOPING NEW FAST ETHERNET TECHNOLOGY


IBM Corp is working on a technology that would allow users to run
Fast Ethernet over the vast installed base of Category 3 UTP
wiring. Details are sparse, but it is thought to centre on new
repeater technology to combat the noise problems inherent with
Category 3.

On the downside, however, it is also believed to require a new
brand of network adapters which are specifically modified for the
cabling medium. IBM has presented the technology to the IEEE for
consideration as a standard, although this is unlikely to come to
fruition before next year at the earliest.

There is no word on when commercial products can be expected from
IBM.

 STARWORKS FOR HP-UX ANNOUNCED


Not content with speeding up its StarWorks system (issue 205),
Starlight Networks Inc, Mountain View, California, has
implemented its NetWare-based StarWorks digital video networking
software under HP-UX. The company has also received a major
marketing boost with the news that as a result, Hewlett-Packard
Co will bundle Starlight's software with all of its systems.

Starlight has also developed a new version of its StarWare
NetWare Loadable Module for NetWare networks, StarWare 2.0.
StarWare 2.0 costs from $5,000 for 10 users to $35,000 for 100,
and it is shipping now. A media server preconfigured with
StarWare on Hewlett's NetServer supporting 50 concurrent users
and storing 20 hours of MPEG-1 video costs $28,000.

StarWare 2.0, which supports the same clients and networking
middleware as StarWorks, will enable users to start on StarWare
on the NetServer and scale up to StarWorks for HP-UX. It will be
available in 1996. Hewlett-Packard and Starlight will develop a
Unix-based client that formats video signals for screens.

Both companies plan to integrate Starlight's video software with
other Hewlett-Packard products, and to develop enterprise
multimedia applications in video training and information-on-
demand. StarWorks has recently been implemented on IBM Corp's
RS/6000.

 NOVELL SHIPS WEB SERVER EARLY


Fullfilling and more its promise, because the thing was set for
launch next quarter, Novell Inc started shipping its NetWare Web
Server, software that turns NetWare 4.1 servers into World Wide
Web publishing servers for external and in-house use, just before
Christmas.

It says the Web Server builds on the distributed services of
NetWare, including the security and management features of
NetWare Directory Services, to create "a powerful, easy way to
use the Internet for internal and external publishing." It
supports symmetric multiprocessing and is designed to install
out-of-the-box under the NetWare 4.1 network operating system.

The list price is $1,000.

 NORTEL TO SELL STRUCTURED WIRING BUSINESS


Northern Telecom has agreed to sell its cable and structured
wiring business to Pittsburgh-based Cable Design Technologies
(CDT) for approximately $90m.

The deal covers Northern Telecom's communications cable and IBDN
structured network wiring business, including its DynaTraX and
OptimaX products. CDT says it will keep on all the 800-odd
employees affected by the transaction. It will acquire Northern
Telecom's Kingston, Ontario facility, and will lease around 30%
of the Laurentian and Lachine facilities in Montreal. These
Canadian operations will function as an autonomous subsidiary of
CDT.

Northern Telecom says the sale is in line with its plans,
announced some years ago, to focus on core product lines falling
under the heading of networking solutions. A spokesman commented:
"We wanted to find a partner to whom this particular business
would be core, so that all 800 people would be kept on". He said
no further divestitures were expected in the near future.

 FRANCE TELECOM MULLS POLISH LEGAL ACTION


France Telecom will start arbitration proceedings against Poland
if the government refuses to grant its Polish joint venture,
Centertel SA, licence to expand operations: its partner in the
venture, Ameritech Corp, has already begun proceedings over the
government's failure to give Centertel, now Poland's sole
cellular operator, a licence to build a digital cellular network.
France Telecom said it would start action if it did not get
agreement by the end of December. It reckons that Centertel, in
which each has a 24.5% stake, should get a licence under its 1991
letter of intent agreed the government. The government, however,
argues the letter is not binding and a new telecoms law forces it
to organise a new tender for two cellular licences.

France Telecom said it would be ready to pay a licence fee
(expected to be about $128m) as required by the tender,but
Poland's TPSA said it would not allow Centertel to join the
tender, in which applying companies had to present bids to the
communications ministry on January 3, because of high investment
costs involved.

Analysts said that even if Centertel entered the tender, its
chances would be slim, because a telecoms law envisages
demonopolisation of the telephone market. Centertel has activated
about 75,000 cellular phones since its creation in 1991 but its
high charges brought complaints it had been using its sole
operator's position to boost profit.

The government has said it will go ahead with the tender despite
the complaints; France Telecom invested $50m in Poland only
because it was sure Centertel would be allowed to expand, but
says without a digital licence it will no longer be competitive.

 US TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL IN DOUBT


Prospects for speedy passage of the US telecommunications reform
bill are more clouded again after House and Senate leaders
indicated that they might try to revamp the proposed bill, a
process likely to bog it down in new controversy and
disagreement.

Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, appearing with House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, said on Thursday "there are a number of problems"
in the legislation that could have been resolved differently by
congressional negotiators.

 JSB REFOCUSSING SEES IT BETTING ON THE CORPORATE INTRANET


Congleton, Cheshire-based JSB Computer Systems Ltd, the company
that claims it was behind the introduction of the common TCP/IP
interface Windows Socket, has refocussed its business to aim at
the corporate Intranet.

The firm, preparing to launch an integrated Intranet suite of
programs this month, is delighted that Bill Gates used the word
Intranet in his Internet strategy briefing in November. So
powerful is his word, it reckons, that between now and the end of
this month the world will have begun to clamour for Intranet
products.

Steve Purdham, managing director of JSB's European division, said
the biggest problem facing the company is educating information
technology people that the Intranet concept is simple but very
effective - and has nothing to do with Notes. He said many
companies using internal E-mail believe they already have an
Intranet, but are not harnessing the Internet-style technology to
disseminate corporate information. For example using ordinary E-
mail, the company would mail a document to all users, regardless
of its use to them. Using Web technology, the company would
merely mail users a message, telling them which Web page contains
the relevant document.

JSB's Intranet suite will consist of what the company calls an
'end user-comfortable' interface, as distinct from an icon-based
graphical interface. Purdham says the icon-based interface was
the best that could be done with low resolution screens and
existing technology, but now there is no need to be bound by it
as a standard. JSB is offering a multimedia kiosk-style
interface, written using the Internet HyperText Mark-up Language.
This approach enables users to see a photograph of their office,
with doors leading to the accounts department for example, which
they can click on for access to the accounts system on the
server. Within the accounts department they may see photographs
of an order book, an invoice book, a customer book, and then
choose which book they wish to use.

Each company can customise this interface by scanning in pictures
or photographs appropriate to its own operation. Behind the
kiosk, JSB has written its own Web browser using Mosaic Web
software licensed from Spyglass Inc. The fully integrated suite
also consists of E-mail, and the File Transfer Protocol. However
JSB said that each is available as a component, and any company
already with a Netscape Communications Corp World Wide Web
browser would still be able to use this, with other components
from JSB's suite.

The kiosk-style front end is also for sale as a separate entity.
The kiosk, available any day now, will run under Windows 3.X, 95
and NT. The rest of the client suite, Web browser, mail and File
Transfer Protocol, will be available for Windows95 and NT only,
at the end of the month. JSB will also offer a server suite, for
Santa Cruz Unix and AIX at present, which includes an alpha
browser for users with dumb terminals. Prices are promised this
month, but should be $100-$200 per user for the client software
suite and less than $1,000 for the server suite.

Electronic commerce on the Internet in the US will be worth more
than $30,000m within five years, according to US consultancy
Forrester Research. The report comes amid a flurry of hype as
valuations of Netscape Communications Corp, the two-year-old Web
browser company that turned its first profit in the September
quarter and will definitely report a loss next time, soared into
the $6,200m stratosphere before slipping back a little.

The report is forecasting a $9,000m Internet infrastructure
market, a $1,800m consumer market, a $4,500m business information
market and an on-line shopping and trading market worth $14,000m.

 C&W TRIES TO HURRY YOUNG & ROSS PAYOFF


According to a report in The Daily Telegraph, Cable & Wireless is
attempting to accelerate negotiations over compensation for its
two former senior executives before a special meeting of
shareholders on January 15. Last November C&W chairman and his
arch-rival, ceo James Ross, were forced to resign after an
acrimonious board-room battle (issue 201).

The board is understood to have agreed to pay compensation to
Lord Young, although he had no service contract. The amount is
believed to be well below the #2m-#4m said to have been claimed
by Lord Young. He has been offered less than a year's salary,
along with pension entitlement and part of share options worth
#1.7m. Lord Young's pension is believed to have been fully
funded, although specialists estimate C&W will have to set aside
around #2m to provide him with a payment equivalent to a third of
last year's salary of #465,000.

James Ross, has yet to finalise his severance terms.

 COMPUSERVE MADE TO LIMIT ACCESS...


H&R Block Inc's CompuServe Inc online service provider has bowed
to pressure from the German government and temporarily suspended
worldwide access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups, in
response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor's office in
Germany. The decision was made after German government officials
investigating illegal material on the Internet, including child
pornography and other pornographic material for adults,
identified the newsgroups as illegal under German law.

CompuServe, which provides Internet access in over 100 countries,
says it does not have the capability to suspend materials on a
country-by-country basis - but the lock-out could raise big
freedom of speech issues in the US if the Germans ever get around
to enforcing their onerous laws in the same manner, because many
right-wing US news groups would likely be deemed to be
unacceptable.

The freedom of speech issues are mitigated by the fact that any
German wanting to access the banned newsgroups can simply go in
via an Internet access provider not operating in Germany.

 NETSCAPE PROMISES THERE WILL BE "DOG-FIGHT" WITH MICROSOFT


Netscape Communications Corp has promised a high-profile "dog-
fight" as Microsoft Corp unwraps a dozen Internet-related
products for what many are calling 'the platform of the future.'

The day after Microsoft's wide-ranging Internet product
announcement last month (issue 204), Netscape CEO James Barksdale
told the Price Waterhouse software industry forum in Redwood
City, California, "It will be a dog-fight, no doubt about it." He
doubted, however, that Netscape would ever have the dominance of
the Internet that Microsoft has of the operating system market:
"We don't propose that we're ever going to be the 800-pound
gorilla."

But at Microsoft's launch the day before, CEO Bill Gates was
careful to avoid the name of the one company that leads most
Internet stories. "To write Microsoft out of the Internet
equation, as many people have done, was pure lunacy," said
Stephen Auditore, President of analyst firm, Zona Research Inc.
"More important than what was said at Microsoft's announcement,
was what was not said - Netscape."

Gates wants to use Microsoft's overwhelming dominance of the
operating system sector to become a leading player on the
Internet. But Barksdale was not put out. "I think they
(Microsoft) will have to win out on features and functionality,"
he said, adding that Microsoft's operating system, which
dominates 80% of the world's computers, did not justify its claim
to be able to command whole segments of the software industry.
"Most people are tired of being obligated, controlled by,
licensed by and tied down to one company. It's a tough fight -
I'll grant you that. But we're brave," he said, introducing a
previously unknown player: "We're well financed and we believe
that God is on our side."

Separately, Netscape has announced the first winners of its 'bugs
bounty', a programme that rewards users who tell Netscape of
major faults in its software (odd that a company should so
proudly boast its underachievement). A pair of software sleuths -
Scott Weston from Australia, Paul Kocher from San Francisco -
each won $1,000 for finding security gaps in Netscape Navigator.

Weston found that Sun Microsystems Inc's on-line language
JavaScript could extract the history of a user's on-line session,
including credit card information. Cryptography expert Kocher
found holes that would enable people to crack the Public Key
encryption by timing exactly how long each encryption was taking
- a method known to reveal some encryption keys. Kocher is
currently working with Netscape to help patch the fault.

The bounty programme hastily followed September's successful hack
into the security code of the Navigator software, unearthing
supposedly secret credit card transactions. As a result of this,
the company decided to offer cash to anyone who could come up
with similar bugs in test versions of Navigator 2.0.

Thus far, Netscape claims the two winners are the only ones to
come up with significant security bugs, although it also awarded
gifts to 50 other entrants for reporting other bugs. All known
bugs are now fixed, it claims. "By rewarding users for quickly
identifying and reporting bugs back to us, this programme is
encouraging what is perhaps the most extensive, open review of

 AOL PREPARES FOR ITS UK LAUNCH


America On-Line Inc is gearing up for its UK launch this month
with prices low enough to give European Internet access providers
cause for concern. The European service, christened AOL UK to
avoid confusion with rivals UK Online and Europe Online, will
undercut prices severely for infrequent users of the Internet.

Exact prices are confidential, but the company claims they will
be lower than those in America, where customers pay no membership
fees, a monthly fee of $10 for five hours, and $3 for each hour
thereafter. This compares with prices among UK providers of #10
to #15 a month, many of which charge a flat start-up fee of up to
#50.

But CityScape Ltd's managing director, Clive Feather, who charges
#50 start-up, #15 a month for unlimited access and 1Mb of Web
space for subscribers, does not worry about AOL UK. "People only
need to use the Internet for 10 hours a month to make these
prices comparable to ours," he said. "Our studies suggest people
spend an hour a day on the Net."

AOL UK disagrees, suggesting an average of seven hours a month,
although it admitted to some accounts spending up to $1,500. "We
have our own therapy groups on AOL," said a spokesperson. A
merger of proprietary services, such as CompuServe Inc, with the
unregulated Internet is the future for on-line customers,
according to newly installed AOL UK md, Jonathan Bulkeley. "We're
already the largest Internet provider in the world," he said,
alluding to the four million subscribers who have access to the
World Wide Web through the AOL browser - or any other. "If you
don't like our browser, use someone else's," said Bulkeley.

In line with its US founder, AOL UK will target consumers
exclusively - "it is not our intention to target businesses,"
said Bulkeley - with a completely re-vamped interface for Europe
including the voice of actress Joanna Lumley and the ability for
consumers to publish their own pages with AOL UK's own publisher
software, NaviSoft. AOL UK will cover 80% of the UK at speeds of
28.8Kbps, with full coverage in the Spring.
