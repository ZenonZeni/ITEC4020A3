<h2 align="center">A little levity about arrogance<br>
<strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </h2>

<p align="center">Some of us are destined for greatness. And the
others . . .</p>

<hr>

<p>There are a certain number of people in the world who believe,
for whatever reason, that they have the one true answer to some
major problem of their time. For a few of them, the belief is
strong enough that they charge off like Don Quixote, arrogantly
determined to make the whole rest of the world conform to their
view of reality. For a tiny, rare percentage of them it is an
actual historical truth that they have the one true answer to a
major problem. By far the majority, however, are just plain,
garden-variety nuts destined to go to their deathbed thinking
they almost had it. If you happen to be a person so afflicted,
how can you tell whether you really are one of these unique
people in history, or just a plain, old nut? </p>

<p>Consider, for example, the true story of Emperor Joshua
Norton. </p>

<p>Joshua Norton was a businessman in San Francisco in the
1800's. In the 1840's, just before the Gold Rush, he tried to
corner the market on rice and failed. He went from being very
wealthy to being destitute overnight and the experience
completely shattered his reason. A couple of months after this
event, he put on a formal admiral's uniform, complete with gold
braid and epaulets and strode in to the office of the newspaper.
He handed the editor a large, official looking proclamation which
stated in quite formal language that, due to popular demand, he
hereby declared himself Emperor Norton I of San Francisco,
California, and Mexico. He bade all his subjects show him loyalty
and the other courtesies due a person of such eminent stature. </p>

<p>From the pictures of Emperor Norton, it is immediately
apparent that this guy has gone around the bend and ain't coming
back. His eyes pointed in different directions, and neither one
quite caught straight ahead. His uniform was formal to the point
of almost gaudy and, at the same time, it was quite apparent that
he and soap were not of regular acquaintance. </p>

<p>The editor, with a rich sense of humor, decided to publish the
proclamation on the front page of the newspaper, in all
seriousness. The citizens of San Francisco, being what they are,
immediately decided that this sounded like a good idea and, by
unanimous acclamation, accepted Norton as their Emperor. It is
undoubtedly the only time in history they ever had an unanimous
vote on anything. </p>

<p>He reigned for about forty years. During that time he ate in
all of the finest restaurants and slept in the finest hotels for
free -- because he was the Emperor. He had three seats
permanently reserved in the front row of the San Francisco opera
house -- one for him, and one each for his two dogs. Twice a year
he would review the police and fire departments as they paraded
by, and then he would make a grand speech to the assembled
crowds. He printed his own money, which was accepted in business
establishments around San Francisco as legal tender. When
bicycles first came out, they got him a bicycle, too, and he
looked all the more daft because of it. When one of his dogs
died, 10,000 people turned out for the funeral to console their
grief-stricken emperor. When the Civil War rolled around, he
graciously offered his alliance and military support to Abraham
Lincoln, who politely declined. </p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, the Emperor Norton was as good a
loony as you have ever run across and I can't help feeling that a
man who was that intelligent must have had some idea of just how
completely nuts he really was. </p>

<p>Now here's the problem. During his reign as Emperor, Norton
came up with three major ideas: </p>

<p>1) He called upon the other leaders of the world to join him
in forming a League of Nations where disputes between nations
could be resolved peacefully. </p>

<p>2) He suggested that parts of San Francisco Bay be filled in
to make more room to build. </p>

<p>3) He proposed that a suspension-span bridge be built across
the spot where the Golden Gate stands now. He even laid out a
complete design that looks remarkably close to the bridge that
was built sixty years after he died. He correctly predicted that
only a suspension span bridge would have the strength to span
such a large stretch, and the flexibility to stand up under the
extreme stress which would be placed on such a structure. He did
this at a time when the only suspension bridges ever built were
rope bridges in remote parts of Africa. </p>

<p>Of course, when he proposed these ideas, the response was long
and uproarious laughter -- the Emperor was up to his old tricks
again. In time, all of his ideas became reality. At the time, no
one believed him. </p>

<p>It has occurred to me that Jesus must have had the same
problem. Think of what must have happened when he showed up for
his high school reunion. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey fellas,&quot; He says. &quot;You'll never believe
what happened. It turns out I really AM the Messiah.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; his school chums say. &quot;If you're
the Messiah, where's your Porsche?&quot; </p>

<p>That's probably why he spent all his time doing miracles like
turning water into wine -- nobody took him seriously until he
showed up with the booze. </p>

<p>So put yourself in Emperor Norton's position and consider what
you might do. Suppose you are strolling down the street one day,
perhaps toking your favorite blend, and a big bolt of lightning
comes out of the sky and blasts you right out of your shoes. When
you come to, you are thoroughly convinced that you have the one
true insight which, unique among men, has given you the answer to
one or more of society's most troubling problems. What are you to
do? </p>

<p>If you keep quiet about it, the world could be missing one of
the best emperors ever to come along. Everyone loses, including
you. </p>

<p>If you act on it, tell everyone about it, and attempt to
install yourself as emperor then you could do some real good for
both you and posterity. Certainly, if you can really save the
world then it seems almost a moral obligation to try. Of course,
if you try, you have to face the fact that, statistically
speaking, it is far more likely that you are a nut than an
emperor, and far more likely that you will be laughed at than
taken seriously. There have been lots and lots of nuts, and only
a handful of emperors. </p>

<p>So what should you do? I think the only thing you can do is
act on the belief, keep an enormous sense of humor, and be
content with the fact that you might wind up in the encyclopedia
next to Emperor Norton. But that's just my take on the situation.
