AMERICAN LAWYER INTRODUCES VIDEO SUPPLEMENT

"American Lawyer" magazine, published by American Lawyer
Media (New York), has begun the production of "Video Trial
Report" with the March issue. "Video Trial Report" is a
special video supplement to be released with each issue of
the magazine.

Published ten times a year, "American Lawyer" has a paid
circulation of 17,700. It is targeted to and edited for
lawyers practicing in large law firms and corporate
counsel.

Each issue of the video supplement will examine what the
company calls "trial lawyering." American Lawyer said that
the video is designed as a companion to the magazine and
will contain the critical arguments and testimony discussed
in the feature article of the magazine. The videotape will
contain clips from coverage of "Court TV", a cable venture
started last year by a partnership between American Media,
Time Warner, NBC, Cablevision and Liberty Media Corp.

The first supplement contains coverage of a double-murder
trial in Dubuque (Iowa) through clips of the trial and
additional "expert" commentary from trial lawyers. The
April issue contains clips and commentary of the William
Kennedy Smith trial. American Lawyer Media president Steven
Brill emphasized that the videotape was not meant to take
the place of the magazine. It is intended strictly as a
supplement to the publication's main article. "This is not
the video version of 'American Lawyer'", he said.

Brill said that each video issue cost between $30,000 and
$50,000 to produce and that he expects to sign up about
2000 subscribers in the first year. "American Lawyer"
readers and other interested parties can subscribe to the
video for $19.50 for each issue.

JOINT VENTURE LAUNCHES SERVICE FOR LEGAL AVIATION FIELD

"Aviation Daily", a newsletter published by McGraw-Hill,
Inc. (New York), and the Federal Bar Association
(Washington, D.C.) have begun the production of "AvLex", an
independent reporting service for the legal aviation
community and those organizations who need coverage of
legal actions affecting the field of aviation.

The new monthly loose-leaf service will provide "current
and comprehensive reporting" of major aviation decisions,
opinions and orders issued by U.S. governmental agencies.
Key legal documents will be indexed and an editorial board
of FBA attorneys will take "an active advisory role" in the
service, McGraw-Hill said.

McGraw-Hill also said that "AvLex" will index, digest and
provide full-text for FAA chief counsel interpretations,
FAA civil penalty decisions, DOT economic orders and NTSB
 accident/ investigation decisions.

"Aviation Daily" editor Edmund Pinto said that "attorneys
are not the only users who will benefit" from the new
service. He said that aviation organizations will "gain
insight into the government's philosophy on aviation
issues, and ('AvLex') will provide air carriers with
optional guidance."

PASHA WINS RULING DEALING WITH PHOTOCOPYING OF NEWSLETTERS

A U.S. District Court in Dallas has ruled that the
photocopying of a newsletter is illegal and has permanently
banned Enmark Gas Corp. (Dallas, TX), a gas distributor,
from cover-to-cover copying and facsimile transmission of
"Gas Daily", a newsletter published by Pasha Publications
(Arlington, VA).

The ruling is the first to clearly prohibit the complete
photocopying and in-house distribution of a subsription
newsletter. Although there have been similar suits in the
past, they have all been settled out of court, before
judicial rulings were given. Terms of the settlement were
not revealed, prohibiting disclosure of whether Enmark will
pay damages to Pasha.

The federal court said that the photocopying of the letter,
and its subsequent distribution to other Enmark employees
without the publisher's permission, blatantly infringed on
Pasha's copyright. The ruling came despite the fact that
the judge found that Enmark was unaware that its actions
were improper or illegal. In explaining the ruling, the
court said that the copying of the letter "had an obvious
detrimental effect on the potential (subscription) market"
for the newsletter.

Under the federal copyright law's fair use doctrine,
photocopying of publications is legal for research and
non-commercial use. Newsletter publishers have argued for
some time that some subscribers have taken advantage of
that doctrine to distribute full text copies of newsletters
to their employees, thereby reducing the number of
potential subscribers. Some newsletter publishers offer
rewards to subscribers who identify illegal copiers.

PRICE COMM. SELLS INTEREST IN N.Y. LAW PUBLISHING; SEEKS TO
RESTRUCTURE DEBT

Price Communications (New York) has sold its majority
interest in New York Law Publishing Co. (New York) to
Apollo Investment Fund L.P. (New York) for $67.8 million,
with little cash involved. Apollo Investment is one of
Price's major debt holders. According to terms of the deal,
Apollo will assume about $48 million in Price bank debt and
will tender $19.2 million of debt it currently holds for
75% of face value.

New York Law Publishing publishes "National Law Journal"
and "New York Law Journal" magazines. Price purchased its
interest in the company in June 1985 for $20.5 million from
SFN Companies (Glenview, IL). NYLP publisher Jame
Finkelstein was "not available" for comment.

The sale comes as Price is attempting to reach a debt
agreement with a new restructuring plan. The company has
threatened to file bankruptcy if it cannot reach agreement
with creditors. The company has about $282 million in
subordinated debt. Under the plan, Price would convert
outstanding debt to 93% of its common equity. Agreement by
at least two-thirds of both its stock and debt holders is
needed for the plan to be implemented.

FEW FEMALE PARTNERS, SURVEY SAYS

A survey conducted by "Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly",
published by Lawyers Weekly Publishing (Boston, MA), says
that female lawyers have gained few top positions at
leading law firms. Although the student body of most law
schools is "largely" female, the paper said, and females
account for 40% of the associates in the largest firms,
females make up only 10% of the partnerships. The paper
said that twenty of the 100 largest law firms in that state
had no female partners.
