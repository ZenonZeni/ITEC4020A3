<P>
The <B>LONGHORN</B> was designed by Robert L. Harrelson as a general
purpose coastal oceanographic research vessel. She was built in
1971 by the Allied Shipyard. In June, 1986, a midlife refit and
lengthening project was completed by Master Marine Shipyard. A
20-ft. section was added amidships along with a new and enlarged
wheelhouse, all new living quarters below decks, and all new and
expanded laboratories. New electronic navigation and communication
aids were installed at the same time. The ship had previously
been repowered with GM 12V71 Diesels. Thus in 1986 the <B>LONGHORN</B>
entered into a new phase of her life as an enlarged, improved,
and rebuilt vessel.
<P>
<B>MAIN WINCH: </B>The main winch is a Dynacon and was new in
1993. This winch is hydraulically powered, is controlled from
a console station on the main deck and currently carries 9,600
ft. of 1/2&quot; 3 X 19. There is a four conductor slip ring and
a capability of handling 6,000 ft. of .680 conductor cable.
<P>
<B>HYDROGRAPHIC WINCHES: </B>Two hydrographic winches, Dynacon
Model 8000A, are available for water-bottle sampling, light coring,
dredging, plankton net, and CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth)
work. One winch has 10,000 ft. of 1/4&quot; 7 X 19 stainless wire
rope, the other winch will have 11,666 ft. of .322 diameter 3
conductor wire in 1996. Also, an extra spool, interchangeable
with either winch, for wire is available.
<P>
<B>CRANE: </B>TICO 150 marine crane. Lifting capacity 14,109 lbs.
at 6'6&quot; extension; 5,666 lbs. at 16'5&quot; extension (4'5&quot;
over the side); and 1,433 lbs. at 41' extension (29' over the
side).The crane is mounted amidships on the 01 deck.
<P>
<B>STERN FRAME: </B>Hydraulic; 12' horizontal clearance; 18' 6&quot;
vertical<B> </B>clearance; 8' clearance overboard; 9'6&quot; reach
inboard, 20,000 lbs. rated.
<P>
<B>DAVIT:</B> Hydraulic; 10' vertical clearance; 2,000 lbs. rated.

</UL>

<P>
<B>VAN CAPABILITIES</B>: Vans of modest size and weight (approximately
10' X 15' and 4,000 lbs.) can be accommodated. Given her size,
the vessel has a large open deck and reserve stability. A radio-
isotope/hazardous chemicals van is available at MSI at no extra
cost except for crane service to install.
<P>
<B>SMALL BOATS</B>: The LONGHORN is often used as a &quot;mother&quot;
ship on projects involving the use of various small craft. Adequate
deck space is available to carry two or three smaller boats to
remote locations. A 16' Carolina Skiff is available at no extra
charge. Numerous other small craft are also available at extra
expense.
<P>
<B>LABORATORY SALTWATER SUPPLY</B>: Unfiltered seawater is supplied
to two sinks in the wet laboratory on a continuous basis while
the ship is at sea.
<P>
<B>SEAWATER TANKS</B>: Seawater tanks are not permanently mounted,
however adequate deck space is available for installation of tanks
on a trip basis.
<P>
<B>COMPRESSED AIR SUPPLY</B>: Compressed air is supplied to both
the wet laboratory and the dry laboratory at 80 psi.
<H4>SHARED-USE EQUIPMENT: </H4>

<UL>
<LI>Trawls: Three 35' shrimp (otter), 60&quot; X 30&quot; doors.
