<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What is Your Business Worth?</STRONG></FONT><P>

	In 1973, Jack Kraft turned a hobby into a business by starting a small nursery and
garden supply
shop.  Today he sells trees, flowers, garden implements, and landscaping services. 
Jack's wife, Mary, keeps the books and helps with customers.  Jack's
college-age
children, James and Helen, both plan to work in the business full time some day.  Jack
doesn't talk
much about money, but it's clear that the family is doing well.<P>
	What is Kraft Nursery worth?  And why does it matter?  It matters to Jack, for several
good
reasons.<P>
	Some day Jack and Mary will both be gone.  The nursery will be included in their
estates.  Estate
taxes - at marginal rates, which can go as high as fifty-five percent - will be due based on the
value of
the total estate, including the business.  Jack doesn't know what it is worth, but the IRS will
arrive at a
value.  If the family doesn't have the cash to pay estate taxes, the business may have to be
liquidated,
perhaps for far less than its value.  By knowing the value today, Jack and Mary can begin to
arrange for
the orderly transfer of the business at their respective deaths.<P>
	"What's the business worth?"  It all depends on the way the question is posed.  What is
the
business
worth today, with Jack running it?  And what would the business be worth were Jack to be
disabled?
And what will the business be worth once Jack dies? If Jack does decide to "hedge" that
potential loss,
the money from his key person insurance can provide funds his family needs to keep the
business
ticking along.<P>
	Eighteen years ago, Jack was a young man with ability and dreams, but little money. 
He started
the
nursery on an "even steven" basis with an uncle, Allen Conroy.  Allen, who is now sixty-six,
is the silent
partner who put up the money.  Jack and Allen split profits after salaries and expenses are
paid.  The
business is so successful that Allen has not worked in years.  A while back, his first wife
died.  Last
year Allen married Lisa, who is at least a generation younger.  Allen and Lisa travel a good
deal and
spend money "like it's going out of style."  When Lisa is in town, she makes a point of
reviewing the
books.  Mary and Lisa are not on good terms.<P>
	What will happen when Allen or Jack dies? At the death of either partner, a partnership
is
dissolved.
The two families will then have the option of liquidating the assets and dividing the
proceeds, or forming
a new partnership.  Can the heirs, however, work together as effectively as the original
partners?  The
idea of Mary and Lisa in partnership is not attractive to either of them.<P>
	Buy-and-sell agreements exist to solve business problems like these.  Under a
buy-and-sell
agreement, Allen would agree to sell his interest in the nursery to Jack at death.  That way
Lisa would
get money, and the Krafts would get the nursery.  Normally, a buy-and-sell would have Jack
sell his
interest at death to Allen.  Here, however, that may not be the best solution.  Allen doesn't
want to run
the nursery, and Mary and the children would not want to be the Conroys' employees.  At
Jack's death, it
might be better for Allen's interest to be purchased by Mary and the children.<P>
	For a buy-and-sell to work, at least three things are needed:  A value must be placed on
the
business; a legal agreement for sale and purchase must be drawn by an attorney; and funds
must be
provided.  If Allen and Jack are insurable, they may find that life insurance is the most
cost-efficient
solution.  Whatever the ultimate source of funding, the search for a workable business
continuation
plan begins by setting a realistic value on the business itself.<P>
	Experts in business valuation, and the IRS, weigh many variables to arrive at a
defensible figure. 
Relevant questions include the following:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>What are the assets and liabilities of the business?  Are the assets reflected at
current market
value?
	<LI>What price would the owners accept for the business?  At what price would they
purchase a
similar firm?
	<LI>What is the worth of the firm's "good will," the tendency of customers suppliers to
continue their
favorable relationship with the firm?
	<LI>Are owner-employees drawing "market wages," or are salaries implicitly increased
to reflect a
return on their ownership interest?
	<LI>What is the firm's earning history?  Do the firm's earnings vary greatly from year to
year?  Are
earnings growing?  Do earnings on the books accurately reflect the true earning power of
the
business?
	<LI>What is the firm's competitive position?  Does it have a sustainable competitive
advantage?
</UL>
<P>

	The complexity of valuing a business, planning an estate, and drawing up a
buy-and-sell, all call
for
expert professional advisors.  A first step, however, and one which can be free, is to have a
preliminary
estimate run on business valuation software.  Such a program is no substitute for the work of
a CPA, or
a professional valuation expert, but it represents an important beginning.  With such
software
provided
as a service by their insurance agent, the Krafts and Conroys arrived at several estimates. 
Using a
weighted average, the families and their advisors decided the nursery was worth about one
and one
half million dollars.  The Krafts and Conroys are now working with their attorney and CPA on
a
buy-and-sell agreement and on overall estate plans.
