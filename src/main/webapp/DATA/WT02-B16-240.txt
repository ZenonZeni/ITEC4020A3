<h2>Polycrystalline Thin Films</h2>

<p><strong>Cell Structure</strong>

<p>Unlike most single-crystal cells, the typical thin-film device does not use a metal grid for the top
<a href="econtacts.html">electrical contact</a>.  Instead, it uses a thin layer of a transparent
conducting oxide (such as tin oxide).  These oxides are highly transparent and conduct
electricity very well.  A separate antireflection coating may be used to top off the device, or the
transparent conducting oxide may serve this function as well.

<p>Polycrystalline thin-film cells comprise many tiny crystalline grains of semiconductor materials. 
The materials used in polycrystalline thin-film cells have properties that are different from those
of silicon, so it has proven to be better to create the <a href="ptype.html">electric field</a> with an
interface between two different semiconductor materials.  This type of interface is called a
heterojunction ("hetero" because it is formed from two different materials, in comparison to the
"homojunction" formed by two doped layers of the same material, such as the one in silicon
solar cells).

<p><font color="#F79D00">Polycrystalline thin-film cells have a heterojunction structure, in
which the top layer is made of a different semiconductor material than the bottom semiconductor
layer.  The top layer, usually <a href="ptype.html">n-type</a>, is a window that allows almost all of
the light through to the absorbing layer, usually p-type. An "ohmic contact" is often used to provide
a good electrical connection to the substrate.</font>

<p>The typical polycrystalline thin film has a very thin (less than 0.1 micron) layer on top called the
"window" layer.  The window layer's role is to absorb light energy from only the high-energy
end of the <a href="lightsun.html">spectrum</a>. It must be thin enough and have a wide
enough <a href="bandgaps.html">band gap</a> (2.8 eV or more) to let all the available light
through the interface (heterojunction) to the absorbing layer.  The absorbing layer under the
window, usually doped <a href="ptype.html">p-type</a>, must have a high absorptivity (ability to
absorb photons) for high current and a suitable band gap to provide a good voltage. Still, it is
typically just 1 to 2 microns thick.
