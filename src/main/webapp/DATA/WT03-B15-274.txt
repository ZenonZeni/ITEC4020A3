<H3>Insuring Success with Robot Teachers</H3>



<P>

<STRONG>Challenge:</STRONG> Regional health care insurance providers were seeking a community relations program to increase local media visibility and provide networking opportunities with government leaders and parents. The strategy had to be unique to set their plans apart from area health care providers that were competing for the same customers.



<P>

The plans also wanted the option to have different levels of program involvement, from considerable local staff participation to having a turnkey operation that would run itself. The method needed to be flexible enough to use at a variety of special events. Finally, the program must actually educate and promote good heath to fulfill a key component of their Mission Statement



<P>

<STRONG>Experience:</STRONG> Health plans in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California have met these challenges by using G&K’s Educational Outreach Marketing programs for more than 8 years. A custom EP robot visits local schools presenting a scientifically validated health curriculum to area students.  In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, an advertising agency administrates the program and creates learning materials for distribution to schools and families. The custom robot mascots also make regular appearances at many public events on the client’s behalf.



<P>

<STRONG>Results:</STRONG> Robots deliver excellent, unique and memorable community visibility. Parents, principals, teachers and community leaders have expressed their thanks for these programs with thousands of letters to the sponsor.  Newspapers and television stations continue to give the clients excellent media coverage. News videos, newspaper clippings, letters and awards are available for viewing. 



<P>

The programs give the client direct contact with state, local and Federal government leaders as well as more than 357,000 families who have participated in live EOM programs.  Every teacher, child and family receives the sponsor’s printed health education materials. The best indication of this EOM’s success is that plans have expanded program use every year since its inception.
