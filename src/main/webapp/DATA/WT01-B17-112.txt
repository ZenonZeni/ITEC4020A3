  <HR>
<CENTER><H2>Cancer: How Leading Physicians <I>Successfully</I> Treat It</H2></CENTER>
<B>There are nontoxic alternatives to chemo-therapy, radiation, and 
surgery that can reverse cancer, as this special excerpt from a forthcoming Future 
Medicine book reveals.</B>
<P>
The thriving practice of Michael B. Schachter, M.D., is housed in a spacious
office building in Suffern, about 30 miles north of New York City.
Schachter's practice is versatile and diverse, incorporating a range of
disciplines including botanicals, chelation therapy, and Chinese medicine.
His medical staff includes 4 physicians, a classical homeopath, an
acupuncturist, 5 registered nurses, 5 lab technicans,  5 stress management
counselors, and 3 lifestyle counselors, and the office of a biological
dentist is next door. 
<P>&quot;My goal is to help my cancer patients choose a
treatment path that makes sense to them, that they can follow with
conviction and enthusiasm,&quot; says Dr. Schachter. &quot;However, I believe that in
many cases patients who select only the alternative program and leave out
the more destructive elements of conventional treatment will do better.&quot;
<P>
Here is a summary of Dr. Schachter's cancer protocols:
<P><B>SUBSTANCES TO AVOID.</B>
This includes tobacco smoke, alcohol, white sugar, white flour, caffeine,
artificial sweeteners, preservatives, food additives, pesticides,
fluoridated or chlorinated water,  hydrogenated fats (margarine), aluminum
as cookware and/or as a food ingredient.
<P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../images/important.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT 
WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=87>
<BR>All doses are general guidelines. Cancer patients need an 
individually tailored 
prescription from their physician.
<BR CLEAR=ALL></BLOCKQUOTE>
</CENTER></P>
<HR WIDTH=85%>


<P><B>FOODS TO EAT.</B>  Practice a low-fat,
high-fiber, high complex carbohydrate diet based on whole grains, fruits
and vegetables, with modest amounts of nuts, seeds, fish, and range-grown
chicken. If possible, consume 50% of the diet as raw foods, such as fresh
vegetable juices; use fertilized eggs sparingly, low-fat dairy products
(free from bovine growth hormone) infrequently. 
<P><B>VITAMIN A.</B> In the form of
fish oil or oil-based capsules, take between 10,000 and 25,000 I.U. daily,
or more under careful supervision. Also take 50,000 I.U. of beta carotene
daily. 
<P><B>VITAMIN C.</B> Patients take up to 10-12 grams daily or until bowel
tolerance is reached (producing diarrhea). 
<P><B>VITAMIN E.</B> A suitable dosage is
800 I.U.s or more per day.

&quot;Ortho-molecular Medicine,&quot; 
p. 402.
<BR CLEAR=ALL></BLOCKQUOTE></CENTER></P>
<HR WIDTH=85%>
<P><B>B VITAMINS.</B> Moderate amounts of the full B
complex-about 25-50 mg daily of each, plus folic acid in doses of 1000 mcg
daily. 
<P><B>AMYGDALIN.</B> Also called laetrile, a dosage between 500-1500 mg daily
in divided amounts is appropriate. 
<P><B>MINERALS.</B>  These include calcium
(800-2000 mg daily) and magnesium (400-1200 mg daily). Iron is used only
when the level of an iron-carrying protein (serum ferritin) is below 40 mcg
per liter of blood. 
<P><B>TRACE ELEMENTS.</B> These include selenium (200-600 mcg
daily); zinc (15-30 mg, daily); copper (2-4 mg daily); manganese (5-20 mg
daily); molybdenum (100-1000 mcg daily); germanium sesquioxide (200-1000 mg
daily). 
<P><B>COLONICS.</B> Help detoxify the intestines with a cleansing enema or
colonics (in selected patients), followed by reintroducing friendly
(probiotics) bacteria into the intestines, such as L. acidophilus. 
<P><B>DETOXIFY THE LIVER.</B> Use  silymarin (an herb), choline, inositol, thioctic acid,
barley grass, and a coffee-retention enema. 
<P><B>HEAVY METALS.</B> If there are
signs of heavy metal toxicity, use a chelating agent such as EDTA or DMPS,
administered intravenously. The patient may need to have all mercury dental
amalgams removed. 
<P><B>SWEAT MORE.</B> The intense perspiring produced by sitting in
a sauna or by exercising aerobically helps detoxify the body through the
skin. 
<P><B>FLAX SEED OIL.</B> The omega-3 fatty acids have strong anti-cancer
effects. Take 1-3 tablespoons daily of flax seed oil which contains 50%
omega-3 fatty acid. 
<P><B>EVENING PRIMROSE OIL.</B> This contains gamma-linolenic
acid, an omega-6 fatty acid effective against cancer (6-9 capsules daily,
500 mg each). 
<A NAME="ENZYMES"> </A><P><B>ENZYMES.</B> These include pancreatic enzymes plus bromelain and
papaya for a powerful enzyme mix. The amounts for individuals vary too much
to give specific recommendations. 
<P><B>BOTANICALS.</B> These include Pau d'Arco,
Flor-Essence (a type of  Essiac containing burdock root, turkey rhubarb
root, sheep sorrel, and slippery elm bark), and Vitae Elixxir (herbal
drops; maximum dosage 6 drops, 3 times daily). 
<P><B>SPECIAL FOODS.</B> These items
include &quot;accessory food factors&quot; that stimulate the immune system: choline,
inositol, bioflavonoids, dimethyl-glycine (vitamin B15)  and pycnogenol.
Therapeutic foods are also useful, including: garlic, chlorella, spirulina,
barley greens, wheat grass, green kamut, and maitake mushrooms. 
<A NAME="BOVINE"> </A><P><B>CARTILAGE.</B>
Take shark cartilage  orally at the rate of about 1-2 g per 2.2 pounds of
body weight for advanced cancers and as an enema (1-3 teaspoons for 6
ounces of water). Bovine cartilage (from cows) may also be used at a dosage
level of 3000 mg 3 times daily. 
<P><B>ANTIOXIDANTS.</B> These include coenzyme Q10
(taken at the rate of 300-400 mg daily) and N-acetyl cysteine (500 mg, 2-3
times daily). 
<P><B>INTRAVENOUS INFUSIONS.</B> Given at the rate of 1-3 times weekly
for the first 1-2 months and including vitamin C (25 g), calcium,
magnesium, potassium, zinc, selenium, manganese, chromium, glutathione, and
heparin. After the vitamin C drip, we give amygdalin (3-9 g per dose). On
occasion, we add vitamin B6 (pantothenic acid);  hydrogen peroxide may be
injected separately; the vitamin B complex plus folic acid may be injected
intramuscularly to build energy. The immune system may be stimulated by
injections of Staphage Lysate ( a common bacterium called Staphylococcus
aureus plus viruses or phages that attack the bacterium). 
<P><B>EXERCISE.</B>
Activities such as walking, bike riding, or swimming are ideal,  for at
least 25 minutes a session, repeated 3-4 times weekly. 
<A NAME="HORMONES"> </A><P><B>HORMONAL BALANCING.</B>
A series of hormones may be needed, including thyroid, DHEA, thymus
extract, natural progesterone and estriol, a form of estrogen. DRUGS.
Low-toxicity drugs may be used, such as hydrazine sulfate (for loss of body
mass) and Pamidronate (Aredia for bone metastasis). 
<P><B>OTHER THERAPIES.</B>
Homeopathic remedies, acupressure, acupuncture, and  magnet therapy, are
all effective in strengthening the immune system. Viewing inspirational
videos, studying mind-body books, practicing meditation, yoga, and guided
imagery help to &quot;reframe the cancer experience&quot; and to stabilize the
patient's thoughts and emotions.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>&quot;Feeling Great!&quot; Says Breast Cancer Patient After Dr.
Schachter's Treatment</CENTER></H3>
   When 42-year-old Louise Prager came to Dr. Schachter in February 1994, she had
been diagnosed with breast cancer which had spread to her lungs, liver, and bones.
The previous June, her doctors had found first a huge liver tumor, then bone cancer
in her ribs and spine. Louise underwent extensive chemotherapy and radiation, but her
condition only worsened. 
<P> When Dr. Schachter started treating her, he put Louise on his multifaceted cancer
recovery program (described  opposite), beginning with a mostly vegetarian diet,
ample fresh, raw vegetable juices and moderate amounts of fish and range-grown
chicken. Louise began taking a long list of supplements, including high doses of
vitamin C, amygdalin, coenzyme Q10, pycnogenol, bovine cartilage, and many others.
Two months after her first visit, Dr. Schachter put her on a vitamin C and amygdalin
intravenous drip. Two days after this, feeling improved, she decided to cancel any
further chemotherapy. 
<P>
By August, she was off all her pain medications and was regaining weight steadily.
The blood tests proved she was making a major improvement and by September 1995, when
Louise's metastasized cancer was in remission, she told Dr. Schachter that she was
&quot;feeling great&quot; thanks to his program.
