     Hydrogen ignition: There has been in recent years much interest in the use of hydrogen
as a non-polluting, renewable fuel.  However, concerns about the safety of producing, handling,
and storing hydrogen supplies need to be resolved before widespread use of hydrogen as a fuel
is feasible.  Experiments are being done to study the ignition of gaseous
hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen mixtures, over a range of mixture compositions, temperatures,
pressures, and for a variety of ignition sources (e.g. electric sparks, hot surfaces). The ability to
specify, and therefore avoid, the conditions for ignition will allow the safe use of hydrogen on
a commercial scale. <p>

<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
      Research in this area is focussed on fundamental and applied energy conversion studies of
high-technology microelectronic and optoelectronic materials, mainly crystalline and amorphous
thin-film semiconductors (e.g. silicon and GaAs) and laser crystals.  The main thrust is in
developing and utilizing a prototype spectroscopic instrument (Photopyroelectric Spectroscopy)
to study and characterize such energy conversion materials through their optical spectra and a
novel, unique, optical-to-thermal energy conversion spectroscopy, which monitors the minute
thermal energy release from the material as a function of wavelength of the exciting radiation. 
This allows, for the first time, the detailed study of the optical quality of the material.  The goal
is to generate sensitive quality control instrumentation for industrial high-technology use.

     The interaction between hot molten metal and water can produce an explosive reaction. 
These events, called thermal explosions or fuel-coolant interactions (FCI), are responsible for a
long history of destructive accidents in industry.  Research in this area is divided into two parts;
experimental investigation of the phenomena and computational modeling of the reaction wave. 
The experimental study is aimed at determining the relationship between the mass of the metal
and the minimum metal temperature necessary to initiate the explosion. <p>

     Thermal plasmas are high temperature gases comprised of free electrons, ions, and
neutral atoms/molecules.  Due to the presence of charged particles, they can interact with the
electric and magnetic fields.  Thermal plasmas, having temperature between 3000 K to 30000 K
are generated by means of dc/ac arcs, radio-frequency (rf) inductively coupled plasmas, and
microwaves. Research in this area is divided into three area of : <br>
<ol>
<li> plasma diagnostics, <br>
<li>mathematical modelling, and <br>
<li> process development. <br>
</ol>
Facilities include a 6-kW, 2450 MHz microwave plasma generator.  Some of 
the current projects are in the area of spray coating of metals and ceramics using dc and microwave plasmas, 
temperature measurements of a microwave plasma by emission spectroscopy technique, mathematical
modelling of rf plasmas, prediction of thermophysical properties of thermal plasmas using Boltzmann 
kinetic theory, and chemical vapor deposition of diamond films in a microwave plasma reactor.

     Application of surface thermodynamics to energy resources processing: Coal and oil
sands.  Development of strategies to determine the wettability of finely ground coal with the
view of improving coal separation from minerals by flotation; study of spherical coal - oil
agglomeration from the point of view of surface forces.  Studies of the pressure dependence of
the interfacial tension of bitumen - water in order to break bitumen - water emulsions. <p>

<i><u>Professor M. Thomson</u></i><p>
Experimental and numerical studies of combustion,  focusing on air 
pollution emissions,  waste combustion and industrial furnaces.  
Techniques include experimental flow reactor studies,  chemical kinetic 
modeling and computational fluid dynamic modeling.<p>

<i><u>Professor J.S. Wallace</u></i><p>
     Combustion of alternative fuels in IC engines is the main topic of research in the Engine
Research and Development Laboratory (ERDL). Investigations examining the use of propane,
methanol, dissociated methanol, and hydrogen in spark ignition engines have been carried out. 
 A major effort is currently underway to maximize the emissions benefit offered by the use of
natural gas as a fuel.   As an example, one aspect of the project is a detailed analysis of the
exhaust gas composition to determine the specific hydrocarbon species present.  This information
will improve our understanding of the sources of hydrocarbon emissions and enable engine
designers to minimize the emission of reactive hydrocarbon species. <p>
     The use of alternative fuels in diesel engines is also a topic of research in ERDL.  
Alternative fuels share the characteristic of poor ignition quality.   Accordingly, the research has
focused on ignition, primarily on the use of a hot surface (glow plug) as a means of ignition
assist. Projects have been carried out with hydrogen, propane and methanol.  Because of the
single point ignition, it is very difficult to achieve reliable ignition and complete combustion
throughout an engine's entire load and speed range.  In the current project, flame stabilization
techniques normally used for continuous combustors are being applied to a glow plug equipped
IDI diesel in an effort to eliminate this difficulty. <p>
     Optical measurement techniques provide a non-intrusive means of acquiring additional
information about the combustion process.  Of particular interest is the use of optical fibers to
provide optical access to engine combustion chambers.  Their small size and flexibility minimize
changes to the normal combustion chamber geometry to facilitate installation.  Development of
optical fiber measurement systems is underway for planned applications to SI and diesel engine
alternative fuels combustion projects. <p>

     A new design for a mobile, lightweight DC power supply is being developed.  It consists
of a fuel cell and a hydrogen storage system. The latter stores hydrogen in a solid that reacts
with water to produce hydrogen for the fuel cell and the water generated in the fuel cell is
returned to the hydrogen storage system to generate more hydrogen; thus reducing the amount
of hydrogen that must be stored and the weight of the system.  The energy density (W.hr/kg)
of this system for many applications is several times that of conventional batteries. <p>
