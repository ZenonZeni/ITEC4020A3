Retirement Dream">
<BR>

It's easy for us to put a price tag on what your retirement dream costs
today. Much more difficult is your job - you need to project what it
will take to realize that dream tomorrow, six months or 30 years from
now. 
<BR><BR>

What do you want to do in your retirement and what financial resources
do you need to accomplish those dreams? 
<BR><BR>

These are the two questions that both retirees and those not yet retired
must ask and answer as they plan for an unknown future. 
<BR><BR>

Whether we like it or not, money is a means to an end, and that's
particularly true when it comes to retirement. Indeed, your financial
state can dictate your retirement age. 
<BR><BR>

Today, according to research by Georgetown University, 63 is the median
retirement age for both men and women. Many of those who continue to
work beyond age 63 are those who feel their financial resources are
insufficient. 
<BR><BR>

Americans' retirement income comes from four basic sources - Social
Security, asset income, pensions and earnings. The percentage
contributed by each has been shifting over the years, with the decline
in Social Security income being the most notable change.  
<BR><BR>

How much total income is needed to finance the retirement you've dreamed
about? You must consider the income and growth potential of your assets
against your retirement objectives. Be forewarned: This will be an
analysis chocked with imponderables - prevailing inflation rates, your
age at retirement, how long you live after you retire, the size of your
Social Security and employee benefits, your post-retirement obligations
and your plans. 
<BR><BR>

Establishing and following through on an investment plan that can take
you to retirement and beyond can be a daunting task. To keep yourself
motivated, we suggest that you visualize your dream and work toward it.
Every individual has his or her own vision of retirement, of course.
Generally, though, as a retiree you ought to be able to... 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream1_subhead.gif" ALT="Go Where You Want To
Go...">
<BR>
After years of meeting a work schedule, you're free to go whenever and
wherever you please. 
<BR><BR>

Your dream may be to travel to see new sights and or stroll down
different streets. For a permanent change of scenery or climate, you may
want to relocate. 
<BR><BR>

Then again, you may not want to go anywhere. In a 1992 American
Association of Retired Persons survey, more than eight out of 10 people
aged 55 and older said they'd like to stay in their current homes. If
that's your decision, your retirement income should provide for you to
cover your maintenance expenses. Let someone else mow the lawn or shovel
the snow. You may want to invest in some modifications that enable you
to stay in your home as long as you want. 
<BR><BR>

<BR> 
Kemper estimates that the typical retiree needs at least 75 percent of
his or her pre-retirement income to live comfortably. Some expenses -
such as those related to transportation or clothes for work - decline at
retirement. But health care and certain other expenses tend to rise.  
<BR><BR>

It's been said that in retirement, time no longer equals money. That can
be good and bad. The "spending" of time can be directed on what may not
have been possible to do before - line dancing at a country western
club, whiling away hours in a fine art gallery or serving a church. 
<BR><BR>

Yet many retirees become nervous at the thought that instead of devoting
the majority of their time to an income-generating occupation, they are
doing nothing but consuming. Retirees are acutely aware that everything
has a price, and that their spending depletes the assets they worked
years to build.  
<BR><BR>

<BR> 

To enjoy the freedom that you have at retirement, your financial assets
must continue to work for you after you've stopped working.  
<BR><BR>

The biggest threat to your doing what you want to do and going where you
want to go - and the source of many retirees' financial problems - is
the effect of inflation on the financial resources you accumulate by
retirement age. Inflation raises the specter that what you accumulate
may not be sufficient over the long term. 
<BR><BR>

At least one retiree expense is especially inflationary. At a time when
the annual inflation rate has been averaging 3.5 percent, prescriptions
and medical care in general has increased by 15 percent to 20 percent
per year, according to the <I>Older Americans Almanac.</I> 
<BR><BR>

Both retirees and people not yet retired need to take proactive steps to
account for inflation. Your success in planning a worry-free retirement,
in fact, can turn on an investment program that anticipates inflation's
effect on your future purchasing power and standard of living. Beating
inflation is your best bet for realizing your retirement dream.
