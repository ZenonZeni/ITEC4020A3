<p><h1>ANNOUNCEMENT: 10/26/96</h1>

<p>
I have sent an e-mail message to those--and only those--of you who have
sent me your e-mail address, in which I explain how to use the TWI.COM
program that you have created using DEBUG to decrypt a secret message
(which just happens to be the TWI.COM program itself) contained in the
article about the ITAR that I posted in RISKS.

<p>
That article from RISKS is now posted on the web page for this course.
