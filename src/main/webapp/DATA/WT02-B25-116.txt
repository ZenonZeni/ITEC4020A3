<p>This Media Outreach Guide is designed to provide you with
ideas and tips to help you generate ongoing coverage of science
and treatment issues in your local health/science, editorial,
public service, and business media. Inside you will find: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(1) science and treatment messages to communicate to the
    media; </p>
    <p>(2) ideas on how to start working with the media; </p>
    <p>(3) science and treatment story ideas; </p>
    <p>(4) proactive and reactive media outreach tips; and </p>
    <p>(5) &quot;tried and true&quot; ideas from different AMI
    chapters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have also included several sample media materials for you
to adapt and use as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>Messages</b></p>

<p>Through sustained outreach to your local media, you can help
ensure that NAMI&#146;s messages on the science and treatment of
brain disorders are included in health-related reporting. These
messages are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Severe mental illnesses are brain disorders.</li>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.</li>
    <li>The cost of treating brain disorders is comparable to the
        cost of treating many other medical illnesses.</li>
    <li>People with brain disorders can lead healthy, productive
        lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>A message chart with supporting facts for each message is
provided in this folder to help you prepare your AMI staff as
well as other spokespeople.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p><i>Develop a Plan.</i> Before you begin talking with your
local media, develop a brief media outreach plan that will guide
your efforts over the next year. This plan should list your media
goals and objectives, outline story ideas, and propose a time
frame for each activity. (A sample plan outline is included.)</p>

<p>To keep science and treatment issues at the forefront, and to
announce new information, you should plan to <b>proactively </b>contact
the media quarterly. However, you should also have a plan in
place to help you react to or take advantage of current events,
such as a negative brain disorder story or a new advance.</p>

<p><i>Identify Spokespeople. </i>Identify credible spokespeople
whom you can promote to the media for expert opinions and
background information. Spokespeople might include AMI
representatives, university researchers, psychiatrists, AMI
members (both family members and consumers), or local celebrities involved
in brain disorder issues.</p>

<p><i>Train Spokespeople on Messages.</i> To make sure everyone
speaking on behalf of AMI is reinforcing consistent messages,
provide spokespersons with a copy of the message chart included
in this folder. You can adapt it to include any relevant, local
messages. If possible, spend some time with each spokesperson to
practice weaving the key messages into answers to media
questions. </p>

<p><i>Identify Key Media.</i> Different story ideas/angles (or
&quot;pitches&quot;) will appeal to different reporters, depending
on their &quot;beat&quot; (i.e., the subject matter they
regularly cover), type of media (e.g., print, television, radio)
and the type of story proposed (e.g., feature, news item). As you
read your local newspapers, take note of reporters who cover
health-related topics, especially those who write about brain
disorders. Also, do not forget to contact public service
directors at your local media outlets as they can provide free
advertising space to further promote the science and treatment
messages (see enclosed print PSAs).</p>

<p>To reinforce the science and treatment messages from all
angles, you should contact reporters and producers who cover the
following beats. (In parentheses we have noted some relevant
story angles for each outlet.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Health (severe mental illnesses are brain disorders;
        treatment works; people with brain disorders can lead
        healthy, productive lives).</li>
    <li>Science (severe mental illnesses are brain disorders;
        treatment works; history of research on brain disorders).</li>
    <li>Business (the cost of treating brain disorders is
        comparable to that of treating many other medical
        illnesses; link to insurance parity issue).</li>
    <li>Politics/Legislation (the cost of treating brain
        disorders is comparable to that of treating many other
        medical illnesses; link to insurance parity issue).</li>
    <li>Public Service (severe mental illnesses are brain
        disorders; treatment works; people with brain disorders
        can lead healthy, productive lives; discrimination is a
        continuing problem).</li>
    <li>Editorial (all messages). <i>Most newspapers have an
        editorial section for articles written by the paper&#146;s
        editorial staff. Editorials are difficult to
        &quot;place,&quot; as they typically relate to other -- often
        controversial -- items in the news. However, the
        editorial staff can play a large role in ensuring that
        your science and treatment messages are included in the
        paper&#146;s editorial coverage.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Build Positive Relationships.</i> Once you have identified
your media contacts, start building positive relationships. As
with any working relationship, it&#146;s important to establish
trust and rapport. Getting to know the person behind the
professional will help you be at ease when dealing with him or
her. This can entail arranging individual meetings with
reporters, news directors, and editors to introduce yourself and
provide background information on AMI and brain disorders;
distributing business cards to all media contacts so they know
how to reach you; and establishing a pattern for continuous and regular
contact. Most important, before you approach a reporter, do a
little research, and tailor your messages to suit his/her needs.</p>

<p><i>Evaluate Your Coverage. </i>Assign someone at your
affiliate to monitor your local media, cut out articles from
local newspapers, and obtain video or audio tapes of television
and radio coverage resulting from your media outreach efforts.
(To obtain tapes, ask the station for a copy or -- if you know
when a story will be run -- set a VCR or stereo tape deck to copy
the program yourself.) Periodically review the coverage, and
determine if any refinements in your approach or your messages
should be made. Also, please send copies of your media coverage
to Melissa Saunders Katz, projects manager of NAMI&#146;s
Campaign to End Discrimination.</p>

<p><b>Story Ideas</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the &quot;comparable cost of treatment&quot; message
        to tie brain disorder issues into current events, such as
        state parity legislation or budget battles.</li>
    <li>Suggest a personal health angle, such as a &quot;day in
        the life&quot; or &quot;before/after treatment&quot;
        articles or a series featuring local individuals with
        brain disorders.</li>
    <li>Propose a five-week series on brain disorders, covering
        the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of each of the five
        brain disorders for which we advocate. Offer to work with
        a researcher or knowledgeable psychiatrist in your state
        for expert comment and input into the series.</li>
    <li>Propose a comparison of the origins and treatments of
        different brain disorders -- those with effects on
        physical functioning (e.g., Parkinson&#146;s disease) vs.
        those with effects on mental functioning (e.g.,
        schizophrenia).</li>
    <li>Suggest an article focusing on the major brain disorder
        research advances made in the past five years.</li>
    <li>Propose a <i>Mental Health Treatment and Resource Guide</i>
        for your local newspaper&#146;s health section. Offer a
        list of local resources -- hospitals, physicians,
        psychiatrists, counselors, support groups, etc. -- with
        experience in helping people with brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Media Outreach Tips</b></p>

<p><i><u>Proactive</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Position your AMI affiliate as a leading source of
        science and treatment information. Send local medical/health
        reporters and news assignment editors a background kit
        that positions your local AMI spokespeople as expert
        resources on the science and treatment of brain
        disorders. You can use the fact sheets and charts on the
        five brain disorders that are included in this folder as
        part of your background kit. Also include a list of local
        people with brain disorders who have been successfully
        treated and are willing to talk to the media. </li>
    <li>Conduct a science and health writers&#146; briefing with
        your AMI affiliate and local and/or national experts. Use
        the briefing to update the media on the latest science
        and treatment research and data. Ask for help in building
        public awareness about the biological causes of brain
        disorders as well as the effectiveness of treatment.</li>
    <li>Submit opinion-editorials (op-eds) -- articles written by
        an expert who takes a position on a controversial topic
        -- to your local newspapers. Op-eds are a good way to
        promote your AMI as a credible local resource for
        information on brain disorders. Before submitting an
        op-ed, call the op-ed editor at your local newspaper to
        learn about the submission process. A sample op-ed is
        provided in this folder.</li>
    <li>Try to place your AMI organization&#146;s spokespeople
        and allies on local radio and television news programs,
        such as the morning shows or evening news. Prepare
        thoroughly for such appearances by finding out who the
        other guests will be and the type of questions that will
        be asked. If you need information or guidance, call
        NAMI&#146;s media relations department. (Beware of
        sensationalist talk shows that could exploit you or your
        spokespeople.)</li>
    <li>NAMI will provide you with information on the latest
        science and treatment advances. Please use this
        information to develop <i>Science and Treatment Updates</i>,
        including possible story angles, for reporters covering
        brain disorders. Send <i>Updates</i> quarterly, and
        follow up periodically with phone calls and letters to
        keep the reporters you have met current on science and
        treatment issues. Always suggest one or more story angles
        when following up with the media. </li>
    <li>Send out news releases and advisories, as appropriate, to
        announce important information, such as scientific
        advances in studying the brain. Where possible, take
        advantage of national and local scientific advances by
        incorporating a local angle. A sample news release is
        enclosed in this folder.</li>
    <li>Invite reporters to AMI events, such as a community
        briefing or workshop on brain disorders. If possible,
        invite a local newscaster to host the event. This will
        help ensure that at least the host&#146;s station will
        cover the event.</li>
    <li>Develop an <i>Open Your Mind</i> award for reporters who
        have helped promote the science and treatment of brain
        disorders. </li>
    <li>Mail or deliver slicks of the enclosed print public
        service announcements (PSAs) with a cover letter to the
        advertising directors at local newspapers. Meet with the
        directors to ask for a commitment to run the ads.</li>
    <li>Work with your local television stations to add a local
        tag to NAMI&#146;s television PSAs, which are currently
        running nationwide. Meet with the PSA directors at local
        television stations, and ask for a commitment to run the
        spots.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Reactive</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>When an article or broadcast story on brain disorders
        appears in your local media, follow up with the reporter
        to offer additional information or comment on the story.
        A sample letter to the editor is enclosed in this folder.</li>
    <li>When a scientific advance is announced nationally, issue
        a press release to your local media reiterating the news
        and offering a local spin and local spokespeople for
        comment. A sample press release is enclosed in this
        folder.</li>
    <li>When a positive story about the science and treatment of
        brain disorders appears in your local media, write a
        thank-you note to the reporter or producer who developed
        the story and offer to provide additional information for
        a follow-up.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proven AMI Strategies</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>New York State AMI created a series of 30-second
        pre-recorded radio public service announcements. The PSAs
        featured true stories about individuals with brain disorders who
        were helped by AMI-NYS. Members were asked to flood the
        radio station with phone calls requesting that the spots
        be aired often.</li>
    <li>Each year, Dane County, WI AMI lines up three or four
        half-hour to one-hour talk shows during Mental Illness
        Awareness Week. This enables the affiliate to cultivate
        ongoing relationships with the television and radio
        personalities and to increase awareness of brain
        disorders.</li>
    <li>A small AMI affiliate in Eau Claire, WI, knowing that a
        local reporter has a sister with a brain disorder (she
        had mentioned it in a story), invited the reporter to an
        AMI meeting to learn more about AMI and brain disorders.
        This resulted in an entire &quot;Lifestyle&quot; section
        of the local paper being devoted to brain disorders and
        AMI.</li>
    <li>The most rural AMI affiliate in Wisconsin, spanning four
        counties, has worked with a local newspaper publisher
        each year to publish a brain disorder resource guide. The
        affiliate puts together a newspaper supplement (mainly
        culled from NAMI and AMI-WI publications) and solicits
        business card advertising to pay for the printing. The
        supplement is then inserted in various weekly papers in their
        area. Not only do all the readers get important
        information, but the business community has also learned
        about the issue from its contact with AMI members selling
        ad space.</li>
