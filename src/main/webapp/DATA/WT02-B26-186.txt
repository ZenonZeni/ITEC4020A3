<LI><A HREF="../htmls/sensor.html"><H3><I>Intelligent</I> Gas Microsensor</H3></A>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a small electrocatalytic microsensor made of ceramic-metallic (cermet) materials that identifies many different gases by their electrical signatures.  The microsensor relies on an innovative combination of cermet materials, cyclic voltammetry, and neural network signal processing.  Work is under way to train the sensor to differentiate gases in mixtures and to evaluate its performance.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/idlams.html"><H3>Natural Systems Modeling</H3></A>
The Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS) is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques, and a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing and field inventory data.  Based on Department of Defense (DoD) user requirements, the project objective is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support system that will link the site military mission with the planning needs for biological conservation and resource management on DoD installations.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/plastics.html"><H3>Plastics Recovery</H3></A>
Through collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations.  Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials, cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics is being developed.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/rma.chem.html"><H3>Treating Agent-Contaminated Soils</H3></A>
Soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents pose a unique remediation problem for military installations.  Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem of agent-contaminated soils, is evaluating different treatment technologies for treating such soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  The chemical warfare agents most likely to be encountered at the Arsenal are the blister agents, mustard and lewisite, and the nerve agents, GB and VX.  Success in identifying effective remediation technologies will pave the way for full-scale treatment of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated soil and may also have applicability to other kinds of contamination problems.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/emissions2.html"><H3>Reduced NOx Emissions</H3></A>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a new method for after-treatment of NOx in the exhaust whereby monatomic nitrogen plasma is used.  The new method should make oxygen enrichment applicable during the entire driving cycle.  Monatomic nitrogen, however, is unstable and cannot be stored.  As part of its work on applying oxygen-enriched air to internal combustion engines, Argonne investigated the use of membrane separation.  Research results suggest that the membrane "waste stream," which contains nitrogen-enriched air, could be used as feedstock for producing monatomic nitrogen.</LI>
