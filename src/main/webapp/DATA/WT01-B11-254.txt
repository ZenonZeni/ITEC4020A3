OF SHARES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shares of each Fund are continuously
sold and redeemed at a price equal to their net asset value on
each Fund Business Day (as defined below) without charge. All
transactions in Fund Shares are effected through the Transfer
Agent, which accepts orders for purchases and redemptions only
from shareholders of record and new investors. Shareholders of
record receive periodic statements from the Trust listing all
account activity during the statement period. I Shares of a Fund
are offered to fiduciary, agency and custodial clients of bank
trust departments, trust companies and their affiliates.<BR>

PROCEDURES</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Purchases and Redemptions Through
Financial Institutions. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shares
may be purchased and redeemed(and in the case of Plans, generally
will be purchased and redeemed) through certain broker-dealers,
banks, trust companies and their affiliates, including Norwest
and its affiliates (&quot;Processing Organizations&quot;). Processing
Organizations may charge their customers a fee for their services
and are responsible for promptly transmitting purchase, redemption
and other requests to the Funds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Investors who purchase shares
through a Processing Organization may be charged a fee if they
effect transactions in Fund Shares through a broker or agent and
will be subject to the procedures of their Processing Organization,
which may include limitations, investment minimums, cutoff times
and restrictions in addition to, or different from, those applicable
to shareholders who invest in a Fund directly. These investors
should acquaint themselves with their Processing Organization
procedures and should read this Prospectus in conjunction with
any materials and information provided by their</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Processing Organization.
Customers who purchase a Fund's shares through a Processing Organization
may or may not be the shareholder of record and, subject to their
Processing Organization's and the Funds' procedures, may have
Fund shares transferred into their name. Under their arrangements
with the Trust, broker-dealer Processing Organizations are not
generally required to deliver payment for purchase orders until
several business days after a purchase order has been received
by a Fund. Certain other Processing Organizations may also enter
purchase orders with payment to follow.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Certain shareholder services may
not be available to shareholders who have purchased shares through
a Processing Organization. These shareholders should contact their
Processing Organization for further information. The Trust may
confirm purchases and redemptions of a Processing Organization's
customers directly to the Processing Organization, which in turn
will provide its customers with such confirmations and periodic
statements as may be required by law or agreed to between the
Processing Organization and its customers. The Trust is not responsible
for the failure of any Processing Organization to carry out its
obligations to its customer. Certain states permit shares of the
Funds to be purchased and redeemed only through registered broker-dealers,
including the Funds' distributor.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Initial Purchases of Shares.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Investors may obtain
the account application form necessary to open an account by writing
the Trust at the address listed on the cover of this Prospectus.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">To participate in shareholder
services not referenced on the account application form and to
change information on a shareholder's account (such as addresses),
investors or existing shareholders should contact the Trust. The
Trust reserves the right in the future to modify, limit or terminate
any share-holder privilege upon appropriate notice to shareholders
and to charge a fee for certain shareholder services, although
no such fees are currently contemplated. Any privilege and participation
in any program may be terminated by the shareholder at any time
by writing to the Trust.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">By Mail. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Investors
may send a check made payable to the Trust along with a completed
account application form to the Trust at the address listed below.
Checks are accepted at full value subject to collection. Payment
by a check drawn on any member of the Federal Reserve System can
normally be converted into Federal funds within two business days
after receipt of the check. Checks drawn on some non-member banks
may take longer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">By Bank Wire. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">To
make an initial investment in a Fund using the wire system for
transmittal of money among banks, an investor should first telephone
the Trust Transfer Agent at 612-667-8833 or 800- 338-1348 to obtain
an account number. The investor should then instruct a bank to
wire the investor's money immediately to:<BR>

complete and mail the account application form. There may be a
charge by the investor's bank for transmitting the money by bank
wire, and there also may be a charge for the use of Federal funds.
The Trust does not charge investors for the receipt of wire transfers.
Payment by bank wire is treated as a Federal funds payment when
received.<BR>

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Subsequent purchases
may be made by mailing a check, by sending a bank wire or through
the shareholder's Processing Organization as indicated above.
All payments should clearly indicate the shareholder's name and
account number.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Redemptions of Shares. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders
that wish to redeem shares by telephone or receive redemption
proceeds by bank wire must elect these options by properly completing
the appropriate sections of their account application form. These
privileges may not be available until several weeks after a shareholder's
application is received. Shares for which certificates have been
issued may not be redeemed by telephone.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">By Mail. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders
may redeem shares by sending a written request to the Transfer
Agent accompanied by any share certificate that may have been
issued to the shareholder to evidence the shares</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">being redeemed. All written
requests for redemption must be signed by the shareholder with
signature guaranteed, and all certificates submitted for redemption
must be endorsed by the shareholder with signature guaranteed.

<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">By Telephone. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
shareholder who has elected telephone redemption privileges may
make a telephone redemption request by calling the Transfer Agent
at 800-338-1348 or 612-667-8833 and providing the shareholder's
account number, the exact name in which the shares are registered
and the shareholder's social security or taxpayer identification
number. In response to the telephone redemption instruction, the
Trust will mail a check to the shareholder's record address or,
if the shareholder has elected wire redemption privileges, wire
the proceeds. See &quot;Purchases and Redemptions of Shares -
General Information.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">By Bank Wire. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">For
redemptions of more than $5,000, a shareholder who has elected
wire redemption privileges may request a Fund to transmit the
redemption proceeds by Federal funds wire to a bank account designated
in writing by the shareholder. To request bank wire redemptions
by telephone, the shareholder also must have elected the telephone
redemption privilege. Redemption proceeds are transmitted by wire
on the day after a redemption request in proper form is received
by the Trust Transfer Agent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Exchanges. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders
of I Shares and Institutional Shares may exchange their Shares
for (i) I Shares or Institutional Shares of the other Funds or
certain other portfolios of the Trust and (ii) shares of U.S.
Government Fund and Treasury Fund of the Trust. The Trust may
in the future offer I Shares, Institutional Shares, or other shares
which will be exchangeable with the Shares of the Funds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Funds do not charge for exchanges,
and there is currently no limit on the number of exchanges a shareholder
may make; the Funds reserve the right, however, to limit excessive
exchanges by any shareholder. Exchanges are subject to the fees
charged by, and the limitations (including minimum investment
restrictions) of, the Fund into which a shareholder is exchanging.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Exchanges may only be made between
identically registered accounts or to open a new account. Anew
account application is required to open a new account through
an exchange if the new account will not have an identical registration
and the same shareholder privileges as the account from which
the exchange is being made. Shareholders may only exchange into
a fund if that fund's shares may legally be sold in the shareholder's
state of residence. For Federal tax purposes, an exchange is treated
as a redemption and a simultaneous new purchase. Exchange procedures
may be materially amended or terminated by the Trust at any time
upon 60 days' notice to shareholders. See &quot;Additional Purchase
and Redemption Information&quot; in the SAI.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">By Mail. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Exchanges
may be made by sending a written request to the Transfer Agent
accompanied by any share certificates for the shares to be exchanged.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Purchasing Shares. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Investments
in the Funds may be made either through certain financial institutions
or by an investor directly. An investor who invests in a Fund
directly will be the shareholder of record. Fund Shares are issued
immediately following the next determination of net asset value
made after acceptance of an investor's subscription and funds.
An investor's funds will not be accepted or in-vested during the
period before the Fund's receipt of funds on deposit at a Federal
Reserve Bank(&quot;Federal Funds&quot;). The Fund reserves the
right to reject any subscription for the purchase of its shares.
Share certificates are issued only to shareholders of record upon
their written request and are not</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">issued
for fractional shares. With approval of the Trust and the Adviser,
shares may be purchased with portfolio securities in lieu of cash.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Redeeming Shares. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">There
is no minimum period of investment and no restriction on the frequency
of redemptions. Fund Shares are redeemed as of the next determination
of the Fund's net asset value following acceptance by the Transfer
Agent of the redemption order in proper form (and any supporting
documentation which the Transfer Agent may require). Normally,
redemption proceeds are paid immediately, but in no event later
than 7 days, following acceptance of a redemption order. Proceeds
of a redemption request, however, will not be paid unless any
check used for investment has been cleared by the shareholder's
bank, which may take up to 15 days. Unless otherwise indicated,
redemption proceeds normally are paid by check mailed to the shareholder's
record address. The right of redemption may not be suspended nor
the payment dates postponed for more than 7 days except when the
New York Stock Exchange is closed (or when trading thereon is
restricted) for any reason other than its customary weekend or
holiday closings or under any emergency or other circumstances
as determined by the SEC.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders who wish to accomplish
redemptions or exchanges by telephone must elect those privileges.
The Trust, the Transfer Agent and Forum are not responsible for
the authenticity of telephone instructions or losses, if any,
resulting from unauthorized telephone redemption or exchange requests
which reasonably are believed to be genuine. The Trust employs
reasonable procedures (including the recording of certain telephone
transactions) to insure that telephone orders are genuine. Shareholders
should verify the accuracy of telephone instructions immediately
upon receipt of confirmation statements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Investment Minimums. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shares
of each Fund are offered without a sales charge and may be redeemed
without charge. The minimum initial investment in I Shares is
$1,000 and in Institutional Shares is$1,000,000. The minimum subsequent
investment is $100 except in the case of Institutional Shares,
where there is no minimum. Shareholders who elect to purchase
I Shares through electronic share purchase privileges such as
the Automatic Investment Plan or the Directed Dividend Option
are not subject to the initial investment minimums. See &quot;Purchases
and Redemptions of Shares - General Information - Automatic Investment
Plan&quot; and &quot;Dividends, Distributions and Tax Matters.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">IRAs and KEOGHs. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shares
may be a suitable investment vehicle for part or all of the assets
held in certain IRAs or KEOGH accounts. An appropriate account
application form may be obtained by contacting the Trust or, for
accounts rolling over from a Plan, the shareholder's employer.
Undercurrent IRA rules, by directly rolling over a distribution
from a Plan, investors can avoid the 20percent withholding tax
imposed on distributions from a Plan. Rollover IRA assets must
be held separately from other IRA assets if the investor wishes
to invest his Rollover IRA in another employer's plan in the future.
The amount of the deductible contribution to an IRA will be reduced
if the individual or, in the case of a married individual filing
jointly, either the individual or the individual's spouse is an
active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan and
has adjusted gross in-come above certain levels.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Currently, individuals may make
tax-deductible IRA contributions of up to a maximum of $2,000annually.
However, the deduction will be reduced if the individual or, in
the case of a married individual filing jointly, either the individual
or the individual's spouse is an active participant in an employer-
sponsored retirement plan and has adjusted gross income above
certain levels.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Signature Guarantees. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
signature guarantee is required for any endorsement on a share
certificate and for instructions to change a shareholder's record
name or address, designated bank account for wire redemptions,
Automatic Investment or Withdrawal Plan, dividend election, telephone
redemption or any other option election in connection with the
shareholder's account. Signature guarantees may be provided by
any eligible institution acceptable to the Transfer Agent, including
a bank, a broker, a dealer, a national securities exchange, a
credit union, or a savings association that is authorized to guarantee
signatures. Whenever a signature guarantee is required, each person
required to sign for the account must have that person's signature
guaranteed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Other Redemption Information.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Proceeds of redemptions
normally are paid in cash. However, payments may be made wholly
or partially in portfolio securities if the Board determines that
payment in</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">cash
would be detrimental to the best interests of the Fund. The Company
will only effect a redemption in portfolio securities if the particular
shareholder is redeeming more than $250,000 or 1 percent of the
Fund's total net assets, whichever is less, during any 90-day
period. Due to the cost to the Trust of maintaining smaller accounts,
the Trust reserves the right to redeem, upon not less than 60
days written notice, all shares in any Fund account with an aggregate
net asset value of less than $1,000. The Trust will not redeem
accounts that fall below that amount solely as a result of a reduction
in net asset value.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Automatic Investment Plan. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Under
the Automatic Investment Plan which is available to shareholders
of I Shares of a Fund, shareholders may authorize monthly amounts
of $50 or more to be withdrawn automatically from the shareholder's
designated bank account (other than passbook savings) and sent
to the Transfer Agent for investment in a Fund. Shareholders wishing
to use this plan must complete an application which may be obtained
by writing or calling the Transfer Agent. The Trust may modify
or terminate the Automatic Investment Plan with respect to any
shareholder in the event that the Trust is unable to settle any
transaction with the shareholder's bank. If the Automatic Investment
Plan is terminated before the shareholder's account totals $1,000,
the Trust reserves the right to close the account in accordance
with the procedures described under &quot;Other Redemption Information&quot;
above.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Automatic Withdrawal Plan. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
shareholder of I Shares of a Fund whose shares in a single account
total $1,000 or more (or of Institutional Shares whose shares
in a single account total $10,000 or more) may establish a withdrawal
plan to provide for the pre authorized payment from the shareholder's
account of $250 or more on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or
annual basis. Under the withdrawal plan, sufficient shares in
the shareholder's account are redeemed to provide the amount of
the periodic payment and any taxable gain or loss is recognized
by the shareholder upon redemption of the shares.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders wishing to utilize
the withdrawal plan may do so by completing an application which
may be obtained by writing or calling the Transfer Agent. The
Trust may suspend a shareholder's withdrawal plan without notice
if the account contains insufficient funds to effect a withdrawal
or if the account balance is less than the required minimum amount
at any time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Reopening Accounts. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Provided
that the information on the account application form on file with
the Trust is still applicable, a shareholder may reopen an account,
without filing a new account application form, at any time within
one year after the shareholder's account is closed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Determination of Net Asset Value.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Trust determines
the net asset value per share of each Fund as of 4:00 P.M., Eastern
time, on all weekdays, except New Year's Day, Presidents' Day,
Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus
Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas (&quot;Fund Business
Day&quot;) by dividing the value of the Fund's net assets (i.e.,
the value of its securities and other assets less its liabilities)
by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the determination
is made.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Securities owned by a Fund for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at current
market value. Securities for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined by the Board
in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Trading in securities on European,
Far Eastern and other international securities exchanges and over-the-
counter markets is normally completed well before the close of
business of each Fund Business Day. In addition, trading in foreign
securities generally or in a particular country or countries may
not take place on all Fund Business Days. Trading does take place
in various foreign markets, however, on days on which the Funds'
net asset value is not calculated. Calculation of the net asset
value per share of a Fund may not occur contemporaneously with
the determination of the prices of the foreign securities used
in the calculation. Events affecting the values of foreign securities
that occur after the time their prices are determined and before
the Fund's determination of net asset value will not be reflected
in the Fund's calculation of net asset value unless the Adviser
or Schroder determines that the particular event would materially
affect net asset value, in which case an adjustment will be made.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">All assets and liabilities of
a Fund denominated in foreign currencies are valued in U.S. dollars
at the mean of the bid and asked prices of such currencies against
the U.S. dollar last quoted by a major bank prior to the time
of the valuation.<BR>
