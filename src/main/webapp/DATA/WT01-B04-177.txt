<TITLE>Drug Watch Position Paper on Needle Handouts to Addicts</TITLE>
<CENTER>
<H3>DRUG WATCH POSITION STATEMENT ON NEEDLE HANDOUTS TO ADDICTS</H3> 
</CENTER>
Providing needles to addicts for injection of illegal drugs should cease. 
No funds should be spent on needle exchange programs unless it can be
scientifically proven that such programs are safe and effective. Studies
based on scientific protocols show no evidence that needle exchange
programs (NEPs) decrease HIV infection rates, and these studies fail to
prove that NEPs do not encourage drug use.  The practice actually
facilitates and enables illegal drug use, which puts the drug user at
continual risk of exposure and results in unpredictable behavior, crime,
violence, rising medical costs, drug impaired newborns, and other societal
problems. 
<P>
<STRONG>Background:</STRONG>
<P>
Needle exchange programs began in 1984 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,
started by a drug-user advocacy group called the Junkie Union. Subsequent
programs were started in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington and San Francisco,
California; and in 1990 in  New Haven, Connecticut and New York City.
Currently, many illegal programs are operating in the U.S.  In Switzerland, liberal drug policies and the drug tolerant atmosphere they created, brought about the open drug scenes, where large numbers of needles were distributed to addicts, and caused a dramatic increase in drug addiction, crime, and violence.
<P>
<STRONG>Rationale:</STRONG>
<P>
Needles provided for the injection of illegal drugs encourage and perpetuate
drug use and unsafe sex that spreads AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  The most effective approach to address the causal role of drugs with regard to AIDS is to prevent or intervene in the drug using behavior that leads to AIDS. Scientific studies show that drug use impacts the immune system and speeds the growth of the HIV virus which causes AIDS.  Reducing drug use would also decrease the incidence of risky sexual behavior while under the influence of drugs, a major factor in the spread of HIV infection, hepatitis and other STDs. 
<P>
Aggressive outreach/education efforts have resulted in decreased
seroconversion
rates of HIV/AIDS without providing needles to the population.  Treatment
programs have resulted in markedly reduced rates of HIV/AIDS.  The HIV
prevalence rate in addicts stabilized in NYC in 1983, well before needle
programs
began.  The Greater Los Angeles area has a lower prevalence of AIDS-infected
drug users than any major metropolitan area in the nation due to the
non-existence
of government sanctioned needle exchange programs, coupled with aggressive
prevention efforts and low cost treatment.  Funds currently being used for
NEPs
would be better spent if directed toward expansion and improvement of drug
abuse treatment.
There is no valid scientific evidence that providing needles has resulted in
any
additional lowering of HIV/AIDS rates, according to the U.S. Center for
Disease
Control report.  Furthermore, as shown in a recent Montreal study,
seroconversion rates, i.e. the percentage of persons who contract the AIDS
virus,
are many times higher in needle exchange participants than in addicts offered
outreach alone.
<P>
Current studies of needle exchange programs are flawed and inconclusive.
 Many
use insufficient sample size, do not conduct objective tests, do not use
valid
comparisons,  and use program staff, rather than independent evaluators, to
conduct client interviews.  A common failing of these studies is that they
fail to
control for the many variables involved.    
<P>
In Switzerland, first a limited number of needles were made available, then
the
supply was increased as the number of addicts increased.  Later heroin was
provided to addicts.  The open drug scenes, which have since been closed, 
became a magnet for foreign addicts.  Currently, needles are distributed at
multiple, smaller sites.  In the past, narcotic laws were very effective in
getting
addicts to enter treatment, since addicts were given the choice of treatment
or
prison.  The threat of prison serves as an incentive to stay in treatment and
off
drugs.
<P>
The problems associated with liberal drug policies, the distribution of
needles to
addicts, and the resultant rise in addiction, crime, and violence, which have
occurred in Switzerland, are now being replicated in the United States
through
NEPs.  Police are instructed not to enforce the anti-drug paraphernalia laws
when
persons possess a Pilot Needle Exchange Program Card.   Persons who
previously would have been ordered into treatment by the criminal justice
system
are given the means (needles, syringes, "cookers," and the NEP card) to
continue
their addiction.  Only a small minority (16%) of addicts in NEPs enter
treatment. 
Residents in the neighborhoods where needles are distributed complain that
giving addicts needles to inject illegal drugs interferes with community
goals of
clearing drug users and dealers from their neighborhoods.  Addicts inject
drugs in
broad daylight, and residents report an increase of crime and violence.
<P>
Providing needles to inject illegal drugs is in violation of U.S. Federal
law.  Federal
funds may not be used for such programs, since they have not been shown to
decrease the spread of AIDS without increasing drug use.   Anti-drug
paraphernalia laws, which are circumvented by NEPs, were passed to decrease
drug use and have proved to be effective.
<P>
An active pro-drug lobby promotes needle exchange programs and the
unscientific "studies" alleging the effectiveness of NEPs in reducing
HIV/AIDS
rates.  The needle exchange issue is a priority for drug-legalization groups,
who
lobby for permissive drug policies and programs promoting so-called "safer"
use
of illicit drugs.
<P>
The most compassionate and humanitarian approach for the addict, the drug
user,
and society is prevention, intervention and treatment. Needle handouts to
addicts
facilitate and increase drug use, enslaving the user and promoting
promiscuous
sexual behavior which spreads AIDS.
