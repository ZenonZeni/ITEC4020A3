Research by Jennie Kline, Ph.D. on the causes of abnormal prenatal development through the study of spontaneous abortions of known karyotype and morphology has proceeded. The research has yielded a number of insights on determinants for spontaneous abortions of different karyotypes. During the past year, results for oral contraceptives were published, those for smoking are in press, and those for IUD use are in preparation.

With funding from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Drs. Kline, Levin, Stein, Susser, Warburton, and Ms. Kinney are examining whether age at menopause varies with prior reproductive history. The study tests hypotheses regarding the role of accelerated reproductive aging in the occurrence of spontaneous abortions of different karyotypes and the timing of menopause. The fieldwork, now ongoing, draws on 625 women who enrolled in the previous case-control of karyotyped spontaneous abortions in 1974-1986. Concurrent with this study, Dr. Kline, together with Drs. Reuss, Levin, and Timor, carried out a pilot study to assess whether the numbers of growing ovarian follicles, as visualized by ultrasound, provide an indicator of reproductive age. This study, now complete, shows the numbers of antral follicles decline with age. Drawing on this result, Dr. Kline is planning a new study to test whether ovarian age, estimated from antral follicle counts, is related to selected reproductive outcomes.

Dr. Kline, with Dr. Ng, has also been examining data from their study "Cocaine Abuse: Effect on Pregnancy and Newborn." Drawing on a data from nearly 400 pregnant women who provided hair samples for analysis for cocaine, they have recently shown that hair testing is far more sensitive in detecting cocaine exposure in the preceding six months than either report or urine testing. Analysis of associations with intrauterine growth retardation will begin shortly. The fieldwork for a subsequent study, "Neurodevelopment of Children Exposed to Cocaine In Utero," is drawing to a close. The study sought to follow-up 568 children, born in 1985-6 to cocaine exposed and unexposed mothers. Location of the infants has proven formidable; analyses will draw on about 190 children who were located and tested for neuropsychologic function.

Dr. Ottman is continuing her investigation of genetic contributions to seizure disorders by studying families containing &gt;3 persons with epilepsy, selected from her original database of 1,957 families of probands with epilepsy. Her research team is extending the 40 families into larger pedigrees by collecting additional information about seizure disorders in branches of the families that were not originally included in the study. The results of these investigations indicate that in a small proportion of families, the distribution of epilepsy appears consistent with an autosomal dominant genetic susceptibility. Dr. Ottman is pursuing this finding by undertaking genetic linkage analysis in these families, in order to identify and chromosomally localize genes that have a major effect on susceptibility.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Ottman's research team is also continuing with analyses of the full dataset of 1,957 families, in order to unravel other features of the genetic epidemiology of seizure disorders. Recent studies with Dr. Nicole Schupf indicate reduced rates of reproduction in persons with epilepsy. Much of this reduction appears to be explained by reduced marriage rates, but even within marriage, live birth rates appear to be decreased after onset of epilepsy in affected women.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another set of studies is aimed at identifying clinically defined subgroups of epilepsy with high genetic risk. The results indicate significant heterogeneity in familial risks of epilepsy, and suggest that the influences on risk in offspring may differ from those in parents and siblings. Thus, risks were higher in relatives of probands whose epilepsy was idiopathic/cryptogenic or associated with neurodeficit than in relatives of probands with other etiologies. Among relatives of probands with symptomatic epilepsy (excluding neurodeficit), risks were not significantly higher than in general population. Parents and siblings, but not offspring, of probands with generalized onset seizures had higher risks than those of probands with partial seizures. Offspring, but not parents or siblings, of probands with onset prior to age 10 had higher risks than those of probands with later onset.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Ottman has also recently undertaken research on the comorbidity of epilepsy and migraine headache. Her findings indicate that migraine and epilepsy are strongly associated: risk of migraine was 25% in persons with epilepsy, compared with only 12% in their relatives without epilepsy. This finding suggests that clinicians treating patients with either epilepsy or migraine should be sensitive to symptoms, and familiar with diagnostic and treatment principles of both disorders. The reasons for the association between the two disorders are unclear. The comorbidity does not appear to be explained by shared environmental risk factors, or a direct causal effect of one disorder on the other. Dr. Ottman is currently investigating the possible role of a shared genetic susceptibility to migraine and epilepsy.

Dr. Neugebauer continued with analyses of data collected in the Miscarriage and Depression Study, with particular attention to the role of stressful events as a risk factor for chromosomally normal spontaneous abortion. He also completed analyses in a study examining the possible association between maternal and perinatal complications and suicide risk in offspring through linkage of New York City birth and death certificate data.

Research by Dr. Neugebauer in two new areas was also commenced. He collaborated with researchers in the Department of Therapeutics' Biological Studies Unit in a series of investigations of the effect of prenatal exposure to famine and risk of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Second, Dr. Neugebauer, together with Drs. Wasserman and Bird in the Department of Child Psychiatry, is developing a study plan to integrate an epidemiologic investigation of the psychiatric consequences of urban children's exposure to violence and a treatment program to be offered in the school setting for symptomatic children. In this regard, Dr. Neugebauer has developed a measure of children's exposure to violence, as witnesses or victims, and a measure of post traumatic stress disorder suitable for children as young as eight. The latter measure uses cartoon figures and an accompanying caption to assess relevant areas of psychopathology. These two measures are being piloted in a study based at Harlem Hospital which focuses on eight- and nine-year-olds with prenatal exposure to cocaine.

Dr. Bruce Levin has a long-standing interest in the intersection of statistical inference for discrete data and computational methods in statistics. This interest has resulted in the development of analytic methods for a variety of problems from a unified viewpoint (that of finite and infinite dimensional linear exponential families). A product of this work is the computing program for conditional maximum likelihood analysis of polychotomous outcome data.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Levin also devotes time to the problem of applying general empirical Bayes methods to test homogeneity hypotheses in large sparse data sets. He works with Dr. Kline on a project to elucidate maternal age associations with trisomy, to define procedures for determining onset of peri-menopausal symptoms, and to study the natural changes in o&ouml;cyte pools. Dr. Levin is co-principal investigator in the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core of the HIV Center and, in this capacity, chairs a weekly consultation for the Center. Dr. Levin is Deputy Head of the Division of Biostatistics at the Columbia University School of Public Health. He is also Consulting Editor in Statistics for the American Journal of Public Health.

Dr. Maureen Durkin's research included epidemiologic studies of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, epidemiology and prevention of pediatric injuries in northern Manhattan, and classification and frequency of disabilities resulting from severe injuries to children in central Harlem.

Zena Stein, M.D. continued her research interests in studies of HIV infection, especially those relating to women and children, and in the epidemiology of mental retardation. In mental retardation, she participated in studies of the exposures to lead of women and children in Yugoslavia, led by Dr. Graziano. She also advised on a projected study of HIV infection in China, and consulted with the AIDS program at the Department of Health in Barcelona, Spain. Dr. Stein attended a meeting in Chicago as a consultant to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Oversight Committee on Project Begin.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to these activities, Dr. Stein continues as Co-Director of the HIV Center. Here her principal research efforts have been to study the epidemiology of perinatal HIV infection, including risks for maternal-infant transmission, factors involved in survival, and neuro- developmental effects on infected infants. With colleagues in the New York City Department of Health, she has clarified the protective role of uncomplicated Cesarean section in the transmission of HIV infection from mother to infants. In Durban, South Africa, she initiated a controlled trial of Vitamin A supplementation to HIV-infected infants; the result was fewer severe episodes of gastroenteritis in affected infants. One of her main activities is to explore preventive approaches to HIV infection in women, in particular the acceptability and effectiveness of the newly available woman's condom, and of the longer-established chemical barriers, mainly spermicides. A CDC-funded activity in Philadelphia, based on the sexually-transmitted disease clinics, will test the acceptability and the effects on recurrent infections of making a range of these options available to women.

In 1994, Dr. Stein received the Physicians and Surgeons Distinguished Service Award from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She was invited to give a plenary session lecture on Methods Women Can Use at the Tenth International AIDS Conference in Yokohama, Japan.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
International activities have continued to play a major role among Dr. Stein's concerns. Dr. Stein continues to be the principal investigator in the Fogarty International Center-funded International Training Grant on Epidemiology Related to AIDS. Since 1993, several fellows have joined the Columbia programs for varying durations of time, both for the purpose of formal studies, and for designing epidemiological studies of HIV/AIDS in their home countries.
