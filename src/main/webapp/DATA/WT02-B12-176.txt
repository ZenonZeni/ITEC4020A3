Swiss Referendum on Asylum</h2>

<ul>


<p>

On December 1, 1996 the Swiss voted 54 percent to 46 percent against

a measure that would prevented persons without documents from applying for

asylum and given the government control over any wages earned by

asylum-seekers.  The Swiss People's Party drew up the immigration initiative in

1991, when Switzerland had a record 42,000 asylum-seekers.  There were 17,000

applications for asylum in 1995.<p>

The Swiss government opposed the measure, arguing that it had already

reduced the number of asylum applications.  The initiative received its

strongest support in German-speaking cantons.<p>

Over 67 percent of Swiss voters rejected a change in labor laws which would

have opened the way for more overtime working and lifted a ban on Swiss women

working night shifts.<p>

Times December 3, 1996.<p>
