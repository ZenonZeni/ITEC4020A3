<H4>States And Territories </H4>
<HR>

<P>
An interesting question to ask at this point is who is responsible?
Who controls landuse?
<P>
The controls of landuse associated with each tenure type are set
by state governments and as a consequence, there is slight variation
between States and Territories.
<P>
The extent and location of clearing within a state as measured
in this project are thus a reflection of the history of land management
by individual States and Territories.
<P>
Thus it is informative to summarise clearing by state boundaries.
<P>
Beginning with clearing, Table 10 sets out the proportion of each
State of the ILZ, and within that, the relative distribution of
the three principal landcover disturbance classes.<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="table10"></A>Table 10</B>: The proportion of the ILZ
of each state in the three critical disturbance classes. The first
column is the proportion of each state within the ILZ.

<P>
Almost all States show the same level of clearing, approximately
50%, within their respective intensive agricultural and pastoral
areas. Tasmania shows the lowest clearing percentage; Victoria
the largest.
<P>
Similarly for grazing, Table 11 sets out the proportion of each
State of the ELZ, and within that, the relative distribution of
the three principal landcover disturbance classes.<HR>

<P>
From these relative figures, one appreciation of the landcover
condition of any State was gained by comparing the distribution
within the three levels of disturbance.
<P>
New South Wales and Queensland both have the largest proportion
of their ELZ areas in the significant disturbance class. In contrast,
South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory
have the largest proportion of their ELZ areas in the class of
least disturbance.
<P>
However, with absolute area this assessment was largely reversed:
the smallest area of landcover significantly disturbed by grazing
was in the ELZ of NSW (43, 000 km2), followed by South Australia
(160, 000 km2), Northern Territory (196, 000 km2), Queensland
(271, 000 km2), and Western Australia (482, 000 km2).
<P>
The two sets of figures above do not convey an overall assessment
of the status of landcover disturbance within each of the States
and Territories with the same power as does the view from space.
<P>
This view communicates the extent of landcover change as well
as its spatial patterning.
<P>
Even though we cannot quantify the relationship between the loss
of biodiversity and the extent and severity of landcover disturbance,
the view from space does give an overall appreciation of the task
confronting conservation efforts, especially within the ILZ.
<P>
Therefore we provide images of the ILZ for Queensland, New South
wales (incorporating the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria,
South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory
for the reader to interpret and contemplate.
<P>
Don't forget there is also an<B> <A HREF="reptill/ausmssal.gif">image of Australia </A>to
</B>refresh your understanding of the whole picture; both ILZ
and ELZ. In addition there is an image of the island state of<B>

<I>The <B>ILZ of Queensland</B> is presented at a spatial resolution
of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection. The extent of the clearing
becomes most obvious when you realise how much of the image is
remnants of the original landcover.</I><HR>

<I>The <B>ILZ of New South Wales</B> displayed at a spatial resolution
of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection. Almost all the forest remnants
are restricted to the uplands of the Great Dividing Range. </I>

<P>
<I>The <B>ILZ of Victoria</B>, in this case the whole state, presented
at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection.
In terms of relative areas, this is the most cleared of all states.
As for New South Wales, the forest remnants are restricted to
the uplands of the Great Dividing Range.</I><HR>

<P>
<I>The <B>ILZ of South Australia, </B>a part of a large state<B>,</B>
at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection.
If you spend time interpreting this image, it is not hard to see
why in this state, there have been several attempts to determine
the limits to sustainable agriculture, the margins of the good
earth.</I><HR>

<P>
<I>The <B>ILZ of Western Australia</B>, a small fraction of this
largest state, at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers
projection. The wheatbelt of this state is almost devoid of any
native vegetation.</I><HR>

<P>
<I>The <B>ILZ of the Northern Territory</B> displayed at a spatial
resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection. There has been
small and scattered clearing within this region but we could not
systematically map changes against a dynamic background of burning
and seasonal contrast. These are fascinating landscapes to interpret.</I>
