<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
In the remediation of soil and groundwater systems, a major concern is the time required for contaminants in the subsurface to be released and biodegraded.  Cleanup via in-situ bioremediation can take up to 100 years at sites where contaminants must be desorbed via diffusion.  Many "pump-and-treat" processes are thought to fail partly because desorption releases the contaminants very slowly.  Another cause of slow release could be the limited mobility of non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs), which become pooled or trapped within soil matrices.  For these sites, innovative technologies are needed to achieve rapid, efficient cleanup at competitive costs.
<P>
Foam remediation technologies have the potential to increase the applicability of in-situ bioremediation.  Unlike other approaches, foams can be designed to remove pollutants and enhance bioremediation simultaneously.  Although foams have been applied successfully underground for enhanced oil recovery, they have not yet been systematically applied to environmental remediation problems closer to the surface.  Argonne National Laboratory is exploring the opportunity to adapt and mature this existing technology for environmental remediation purposes, such as for the cleanup of hazardous waste at federal facilities.

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne is using foams to release and mobilize NAPL contaminants in the subsurface and is coupling this technology with bioremediation (either in-situ or ex-situ).  Unlike surfactants, foams remove contaminants by physical scouring, in addition to surface tension reduction and solubilization.  The physical scouring mechanism is particularly well suited for extraction of residual trapped NAPLs from soil matrices.  This characteristic, combined with the effective areal sweep or "plug-flow" movement of foams, minimizes the channeling tendencies common to other remediation technologies.
<P>
The foam can be either produced in-situ or injected into the contaminated zone.  Injection/production wells (vertical or horizontal) can be used to assist in delivering, transporting, and monitoring the foams through the subsurface.  The proper selection of foaming agents can aid the delivery of the foam, its sweep front, the foam stability, its efficacy to release NAPLs in the subsurface, and the resultant biodegradability of the foam/NAPL mixture.
<P>
Either aerobic or anaerobic environments can be established in the subsurface, depending on the selection of the carrier gas used to generate the foams.  This enables the foam-pollutant system to be biodegraded adequately for the particular contaminant of concern.  For example, trichloroethylene can be degraded aerobically, while tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride at the same site must be biodegraded anaerobically.
<P>
It is anticipated that this technology can be applied to both the saturated and vadose zones for remediation of soils contaminated with either chlorinated organics, such as trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as chrysene, benz(a)anthracene, anthracene, fluoranthene, or phenanthrene.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne's research has elucidated some of the properties for foam flow in unconsolidated porous media at shallow depths.  This information has been integrated into a generic foam-flow model that can be used to design field processes.  Research with test soils has shown that foams remove NAPL-like contaminants 10 times more effectively than do surfactant flushing solutions.  Other aspects of foam-assisted remediation, such as enhanced bacterial transport in porous media, are also being investigated with industrial participants.

<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
A field demonstration of this technology is planned to begin in fiscal year 1996, given successful research on technical design criteria.
<P>
Argonne researchers have begun applying magnetic resonance imaging to examine pollutant/soil interactions and three-dimensional modeling to predict foam behavior and porous media as an aid to foam control and design.
