<title>Renewable Energy Has Become Reliable</title>

<H2><I>B. </I>Renewable Energy Has Become Reliable</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
The reliability of renewables has improved markedly. Although renewables 
by their nature provide power intermittently (when the sun shines or the 
wind blows), technological improvements have made renewable energy highly 
reliable. For example, new models of wind turbines are up and running 95 
percent of the time the wind blows. Many renewable technologies can 
generate electricity as part of base load or are otherwise dispatchable; 
geothermal units can have capacity factors greater than 90 percent.<a href="#307" name="r307"> [ 307 ] </a>For 
comparison, the average capacity factor for all operating coal-fired power 
plants in the United States was 60 percent from 1990 to 1994. A recent 
<A NAME="NationalRenewableEnergyLaboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory<a> study suggests that intermittent 
generation load levels of at  least 10 percent (and perhaps as high as 20 
percent) can be accommodated with no adverse system impacts.<a href="#308" name="r308"> [ 308 ] </a>In 
California, <A NAME="PacificGasandElectric">Pacific Gas and Electric <a> uses wind to supply as much as 7 
percent of its system load - 5 percent during peak hours - with no 
adverse effects.<BR>
 <p>     <B><I><A NAME="EnergyWorks">EnergyWorks </a>. </B></I><A NAME="Bechtel">Bechtel</a> recently joined forces with 
<A NAME="Pacificorp">Pacificorp<a> of Portland, Oregon to form EnergyWorks, a joint venture based 
in Landover, Maryland to develop, finance, own, and operate small, 
renewable energy systems, including solar, wind, and hybrid energy 
systems. Bechtel's president, John D. Carter, sees the venture as an 
opportunity in an increasing global shift toward renewables. EnergyWorks' 
president and CEO Jeffrey W. Eckel notes, "The use of new renewable energy 
technologies is growing at a rate between 10 and 20 percent annually in a 
number of markets," including foreign markets. The EnergyWorks venture 
reflects the growing economic viability of renewable energy.<BR>

<P><A NAME="307"  HREF="#r307">307.</a> Capacity factor is the amount of load achieved by operating a given 
generation source, and is a measure of dependability. Solar- and 
wind-based projects, without storage, typically have capacity factors of 
20 to 30 percent because they operate only when the sun shines or the wind 
blows. Swezey, B., and Wan, Y., <I>The True Cost of Renewables: An 
Analytic Response to the Coal Industry's Attack on Renewable Energy</I>,

Laboratory, October 1995).<BR>
<P><A NAME="308"  HREF="#r308">308.</a> When power from intermittent resources is not available, other 
generators on the system are called on to supply the power. At low 
renewables penetration levels, this situation is much like the normal 
utility system response to load fluctuations. At higher renewables 
penetration levels, a utility might have to provide additional 
dispatchable capacity to compensate for both normal load fluctuations and 
the output variations of the intermittent renewables generators. Research 
shows that intermittent penetration levels above 10 percent are entirely 
feasible, with any technical limits being a function of the specific 
utility system characteristics.<BR>
